Strange that something so obvious is so often dismissed or overlooked. reply fsloth 47 minutes agorootparentCrowdstrike though is not part of a system of engineered design. It’s a half-baked rootkit sold as a figleaf for incompetent it managers so they can implement ”best practices” in their companys PC:s. The people purchasing it don’t actually know what it does, they just know it’s something they can invest their cybersecurity budget into and have an easy way to fullfill their ”implement cybersecurity” kpi:s without needing to do anything themselves. reply lawlessone 17 minutes agorootparent>they just know it’s something they can invest their cybersecurity budget into and have an easy way to fullfill their ”implement cybersecurity” kpi:s To be fair. This is what companies like Crowdstrike are selling to these managers. Emphasis on the world \"SELLING\" reply bryant 2 minutes agorootparentprevThis is an interesting response. I'm curious why you specifically believe \"it’s a half-baked rootkit sold as a figleaf for incompetent it managers.\" reply rincebrain 57 minutes agorootparentprevIf you realize something horrific, your options are to decide it's not your problem (and feel guilty when it blows up), carefully forget you learned it, or try to do something to get it changed. Since the last of these involves overcoming everyone else's shared distress in admitting the emperor has no clothes, and the first of these involves a lot of distress for you personally, a lot of people opt for option B. reply __MatrixMan__ 42 minutes agorootparent> overcoming everyone else's shared distress in admitting the emperor has no clothes I don't disagree, but why do we do we react this way? Doesn't knowing the emperor has no clothes instill a bit of hope that things can change? I feel for the people who were impacted by this, but I'm also a little bit excited. Like... NOW can we fix it? Please? reply rincebrain 12 minutes agorootparentThe problem is, making noise incurs risk. The higher up in large organizations you go, in politics or employment or w/e, the more what matters is not facts, but avoiding being visibly seen to have made a mistake, so you become risk-averse, and just ride the status quo unless it's an existential threat to you or something you can capitalize on for someone else's misjudgment. So if you can't directly gain from pointing out the emperor's missing clothes, there's no incentive to call it out, there's active risk to calling it out if other people won't agree, and moreover, this provides an active incentive for those with political capital in the organization to suppress the embarrassment of anyone pointing out they did not admit the problem everyone knew was there. (This is basically how you get the \"actively suppress any exceptions to people collectively treating something as a missing stair\" behaviors.) reply johnklos 27 minutes agorootparentprevIt's a nice idea, but has that worked historically? Some people will make changes, but I think we'd be naive to think that things will change in any large and meaningful way. Having another I-told-you-so isn't so bad, though - it does give us IT people a little more latitude when we tell people that buying the insecurity fix du jour increases work and adds more problems than it addresses. reply __MatrixMan__ 16 minutes agorootparentSure, on long enough timescales. I mean, there's less lead in the environment than there used to be. We don't practice blood letting anymore. Things change. Eventually enough will be enough and we'll start using systems that are transparent about what their inputs are and have a way of operating in cases where the user disables one of those inputs because it's causing problems (e.g. crowdstrike updates). I'd just like it to be soon because I'm interested in building such systems and I'd rather be paid to do so instead of doing it on my off time. reply yawnxyz 8 minutes agorootparentprevthere are way too many horrific things in the world to learn about... and then realizing you can't do something about every of those things. But at least you can tackle one of them! (In my case, antibiotic resistance) reply HPsquared 52 minutes agorootparentprevOption C is to quietly distance yourself from it. reply HaZeust 1 hour agoparentprevYup - my mom went into the ER for stroke symptoms last night and was put under MRI. The MRI imaging could NOT be sent to the off-site radiologist and they had to come in -- turned out the MRI outputs weren't working at all. We were discharged at midnight by the doctor, the nurse didn't come into our exam room to tell us until 4am. I can't imagine the mess this has caused. reply jmcgough 0 minutes agorootparentHope she's okay. For better or worse, our entire emergency department flow is orchestrated around epic.

Yes it is. Windows was created for the \"Personal Computer\" with zero thought initially put in to security. It has been fighting that heritage for 30 years. The reason Crowdstrike exists at all is due to shortcomings (real or perceived) in Windows security. Unix (and hence Linux and MacOS) was designed as a multi-user system from the start, so access controls and permissions were there from the start. It may have been a flawed security model and has been updated over time, but at least it started some notion of security. These ideas had already expanded to networks before Microsoft ever heard the word Netscape. reply qwytw 6 minutes agorootparent> was designed as a multi-user system from the start, so access controls and permissions were there from the start. Right and Windows NT wasn't? Obviously it supported all of those things from the very beginning (possibly even in a superior way to Unix in some cases considering it's a significantly more modern OS)... The fact that MS developed another OS called Windows (3.1 -> 95 -> 98) prior to that which was to some extent binary compatible with NT seems somewhat tangential. Otherwise the same arguments would surely apply to MacOS as well? > These ideas had already expanded to networks before Microsoft ever heard the word Netscape. Does not seem like a good thing on its own to me. Just solidifies the fact the it's an inherently less modern OS than Windows(NT) (which still might have various design flaws obviously, that might be worth discussing, it just has nothing to do whatsoever with what you're claiming here...) reply crowdstriker 13 minutes agorootparentprevYour argument is completely invalid because Linux and Mac also wouldn't exist without Windows. reply ttyprintk 28 minutes agorootparentprevNo less than three baskets, or you cannot apply for bailouts. If you want to argue your industry is a load-bearing element in the economy: no less than three baskets. reply ahachete 45 minutes agorootparentprevLenovo and Dell have some laptops with Linux, and they are very good ones. (not sure if you meant rugged ones, that may not be the case, but I guess this is a tiny percentage of the market) reply linuxlizard 38 minutes agorootparentCrowdstrike also has an Ubuntu Linux version. We're required to install it at work. reply __MatrixMan__ 24 minutes agorootparentprevMaking everything browser based doesn't help (unless you can walk across the room and touch the server). The web is all about creating fast-acting local dependency on the actions of far-away people who are not known or necessarily trusted by the user. Like crowdstrike, it's about remote control, and it's exactly that kind of dependency that caused this problem. I love piling on Microsoft as much as the next guy, but this is bigger than that. It's a structural problem with how we (fail to) manage trust. reply trhway 43 minutes agorootparentprevSolarWinds story was quickly forgotten, and this one will be too, and we'll continue to build such special single points of global catastrophic failure into our craftly architected decentralized highly robust horizontally scaled multi-datacenter-region systems reply TeaBrain 7 minutes agorootparentThe SolarWinds story wasn't forgotten. Late last year the SEC launched a complaint against SolarWinds and its CISO. It was only yesterday that many of the SEC's claims against the CISO were dismissed. reply rtev 19 minutes agorootparentprevSolarwinds is still dealing with the reputation damage and fallout today from that breach. People don’t forget about this stuff. the lawsuits will likely be hitting crowdstrike for years to come reply davycro 2 hours agoparentprevThe system crashed while my coworker was running a code (aka doing CPR) in the ER last night. Healthcare IT is so bad at baseline that we are somewhat prepared for an outage while resuscitating a critical patient. reply peterleiser 1 hour agorootparentThe second largest hospital group in Nashville experienced a ransomware attack about two months ago. Nurses told me they were using manual processes for three weeks. reply dwatson92 2 hours agorootparentprevExcuse my ignorance, but what systems are needed for CPR? reply SamuelAdams 2 hours agorootparentI used to work in healthcare IT. Running a code is not always only CPR. Different medications may be pushed (injected into the patient) to help stabilize them. These medications are recorded via a bar code and added to the patients chart in Epic. Epic is the source of truth for the current state of the patient. So if that is suddenly unavailable that is a big problem. reply 627467 32 minutes agorootparentOkay,not having historical data avaliable to make decision on what to put into a patient is understandable - but maybe also print critical stuff per patient once a day? - but not being able to log an action in realtime should not be a critical problem. reply pas 28 minutes agorootparentmaybe non-volatile e-paper, which can be updated easily if things are up, and if the system is down it still works as well as the printouts reply Key89 2 hours agorootparentprevis there an ELI5 on how can this happen? Like i get its a boot loop, but what did crowdstrike do that cause it? How can non malicious code trigger boot loop? reply fsloth 1 hour agorootparentI would not call Crowdstrike ”non-malicious”. It’s incredibly incompetently implemented kit that’s sold to organizations as snakeoil that ”protects them from cybercrime”. It’s purpose is to give incompetent IT managers to ”implement something plausible” against cyberincidents, and when an incident happens, it gives them the excuse that ”they followed best practices”. It craps the users PC while at it too. I hope the company burns to the ground and large organizations realize it’s not a really great idea to run a rootkit at every PC ”just because everyone else does it”. reply mulletbum 42 minutes agorootparentI have to say, it saved our ass a few months ago. Some hacker got access to one of multiple brands server infrastructure, started running PowerShell to weed through the rest and CrowdStrike notified us (the owning brand) that something was off about the PowerShell being ran. Turns out this small brand was running a remote in tool that had an exploit. Had Crowdstrike not been on that server we wouldn't have known until someone manually got in there to look at it. reply fsloth 33 minutes agorootparentHappy to know it works when needed! But the implementation (when running on user PC:s) is still half-baked. My experience is using PC with Crowdstrike for daily software development. In that setting it’s quite terrible. The server setting sounds a much more reasonable use. reply crowdstriker 3 minutes agorootparentI've had CrowdStrike completely delete a debug binary I ran from Visual Studio. Its injected module in every single process shows up in all of our logging. swells34 28 minutes agorootparentprevI assume if you weren't running crowdstrike, you would have still had logging/alerting systems set up, no? reply kspacewalk2 19 minutes agorootparentprevWhat specifically makes it \"incredibly incompetently implemented\", and would you simply derisively describe any system that can push updates requiring admin access a \"rootkit\", or is there some way you envision a \"competently implemented rootkit\" operating? Your opinion seems incredibly strong so I'm just curious how you arrived at it? I'm not in IT, but the idea of both rolling out updates remotely and outsourcing the timely delivery of these updates to my door* is a no brainer. * if not directly to all my thousands of PCs without testing, which is 100% a \"me\" task and not a \"that cloud provider over there\" task reply attentive 4 minutes agorootparentIt's \"rootkit\" because it literally implements remote code execution as root as a feature. __MatrixMan__ 1 hour agorootparentprevCrowdstrike needs to be the first person in the room so that they can act like the boss. If other people show up before crowdstrike, there's a possibility that they'll somehow prevent crowdstrike from being the boss. For this reason, crowdstrike integrates with the boot process in ways that most software doesn't. Their ability to monitor and intervene against all software on the system also puts them in a position to break all software on the system. more accurately: s/boss/most informed spy/g reply pas 25 minutes agorootparentprevWhat they did is that they forgot to write a graceful failure mode for their driver loader. (And what they did on top of it is to ship it without testing.) reply monocasa 1 hour agorootparentprevKernel driver bug that essentially defaults, then on reboot loads the same driver early on segfaults and reboots again, ad nauseum. reply baryphonic 1 hour agorootparents/defaults/segfaults/ # stupid autocorrect reply sieste 57 minutes agorootparentprevBest ELI5 ever! reply skocznymroczny 17 minutes agorootparentprevCrashes in kernel mode usually result in BSODs. reply dwatson92 2 hours agorootparentprevMakes sense, thank you for the explanation. reply monkmartinez 1 hour agorootparentprevYou need to document everything during a code arrest. All interventions, vitals and other pertinent information must be logged for various reasons. Paper and pen work but they are very difficult to audit and/or keep track of. Electronic reporting is the standard and deviating from the standard is generally a recipe for a myriad of problems. reply devilbunny 35 minutes agorootparentWe chart all codes on paper first and then transfer to computer when it's done. There's a nurse whose entire job is to stay in one place and document times while the rest of us work. You don't make the documenter do anything else because it's a lot of work. And that's in the OR, where vitals are automatically captured. There just aren't enough computers to do real-time electronic documentation, and even if there were there wouldn't be enough space. reply davycro 59 minutes agorootparentprevYou can do CPR without a computer system, but changing systems in the middle of resuscitation where a delay of seconds can mean the difference between survival and death is absolutely not ideal. CPR in the hospital is a coordinated team response and if one person can’t do their job without a computer then the whole thing breaks down. reply pksebben 2 hours agorootparentprevMy guess is the system that notifies the next caretaker in the chain that someone is currently receiving CPR. if it works, there's a lot more to be done to get the patient to stable. reply FireBeyond 50 minutes agorootparentprevAs a paramedic, there is very little about running a code that requires IT. You have the crash cart, so not even stuck trying to get meds out of the Pyxis. The biggest challenge is charting / scribing the encounter. reply JshWright 28 minutes agorootparentlol, yep, that was my take on this...

Heart attacks and 911 are not things you build with Windows based systems. We understood this 25 years ago. reply Wytwwww 13 minutes agorootparentWell you can use stupid broken software with any OS, not just Windows. Isn't CrowdStrike Falcon available on Linux, is there any reason why couldn't they have introduced a similar bug and similar consequences there? reply Nathanael_M 6 minutes agorootparentprevBecause Windows is accessible and Linux requires uncommon expertise and short term cost that is just not practical for lots of places. Goodluck teaching administrators an entirely new ecosystem, goodluck finding software off the shelf for Linux. Bespoke is expensive, expertise is rare, Linux is sadly niche. reply plonk 8 hours agoparentprevDid the person survive? reply jmcgough 8 hours agorootparentWe have limited visibility into this in the emergency department. You stabilize the patient and admit them to the hospital, then they become internal medicine or ICU's patient. Thankfully most of the work was done and consults were called prior to the outage, but they were in critical condition. reply perfectstorm 4 hours agorootparentnext [16 more] i'll admit i have no idea what i'm talking about but isn't there some Plan B options? something that's more manual? or are surgeons too reliant on computers? reply zamadatix 4 hours agorootparentThere are plan B options like paper charting, downtime procedures, alternative communication methods and so on. So while you can write down a prescription and cut a person open you can't manually do things pull up the patient's medical history for the last 10 years in a few seconds, have an image read remotely when there isn't a radiologist available on site, or electronically file for the meds to just show up instantly (all depending on what the outage issue is affecting of course). For short outages some of these problems are more \"it caused a short rush on limited staff\" than \"things were falling apart\". For longer outages it gets to be quite dangerous and that's where you hope it's just your system that's having issues and not everyone in the region so you can divert. If the alternatives/plan b's were as good or better than the plan a's then they wouldn't be the alternatives. Nobody is going to have half a hospital's care capacity sit as backup when they could use that year round to better treat patients all the time, they just have plans of last resort to use when what they'd like to use isn't working.

I worked for a company that sold and managed medical radiology imaging systems. One of our customers' admins called and said \"Hey, new scans aren't being properly processed so radiologists can't bring them up in the viewer\". I told him I'd take a look at it right away. A few minutes later, he called back; one of their ERs had a patient dying of a gunshot wound and the surgeon needed to get the xray up so he could see where the bullet was lodged before the guy bled out on the table. Long outages are terrifying, but it only takes a few minutes for someone to die because people didn't have the information they needed to make the right calls. reply zamadatix 2 hours agorootparentYep, when patients often still die while everything is working fine even a minor inconvenience like \"all of the desktop icons reset by mistake\" can be enough to tilt the needle the wrong way for someone. reply lupire 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat's insane medical malpractice is that radiology scans aren't displayed locally first. You don't need 4 years of specialized training to see a bullet on a scan. reply brendoelfrendo 1 hour agorootparentGP referred to \"processed,\" which could mean a few things. I interpreted it to mean that the images were not recording correctly locally prior to any upload, and they needed assistance with that machine or the software on it. reply sqeaky 3 hours agorootparentprevI am talking out my ass, but... Seems like a possible plan would be duplicate computer systems that are using last week's backup and not set to auto-update. Doesn't cover you if the databases and servers go down (unless you can have spares of those too), but if there is a bad update, a crypto-locker, or just a normal IT failure each department can switch to some backups and switch to a slightly stale computer instead of very stale paper. reply regularfry 3 hours agorootparentCan only speak for the UK here, but having one computer system that is sufficiently functional for day-to-day operations is often a challenge, let alone two. reply devilbunny 2 hours agorootparentprevMy hospital's network crashed this week (unrelated to this). Was out for 2-3 hours in early afternoon. The \"downtime\" computers were affected just like everything else because there was no network. Phones are all IP-based now; they didn't work. Couldn't check patient histories, couldn't review labs, etc. We could still get drugs, thankfully, since each dispensing machine can operate offline. reply zamadatix 2 hours agorootparentprevThere are often such plans from DR systems to isolated backups to secondary system, as much as risk management budget allow at least. Of course it takes time to switch to these and back, the missing records cause chaos (both inside synced systems and with patient data) both ways and it takes a while to do. On top of that not every system will be covered so it's still a limited state. reply mehrau 3 hours agorootparentprevYes buy the more high available you do the more it costs and it's not like this happens every week. reply sqeaky 3 hours agorootparentAs I was finishing my previous costs it occurred to me that costs are fungible. Money spent on spares is not spent on cares. reply lr1970 2 hours agorootparentprevThere are problems with getting lab results, X-rays, CT and MRI scans. They do not have paper-based Plan B. IT outage in a modern hospital is a major risk to life and health of their patients. reply Bjartr 4 hours agorootparentprevI think it's eventually manageable for some subset of medical procedures, but the transition to that from business as usual is a frantic nightmare.

Or maybe I'm giving these institutions too much credit? reply nubinetwork 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about surgeons, but nursing and labs have paper fallback policies... they can backload the data later. reply regularfry 3 hours agorootparentIt's often the case that the paper fallbacks can't handle anywhere near the throughput required. Yes, there's a mechanism there, but it's not usable beyond a certain load. reply chinathrow 1 hour agoparentprevYet their stock tanked only a couple of dollars. They (and their customers) should face some rather unpleasant lawsuits. If you let others own your systems, you should not be allowed to provide critical infrastructure. reply rabidonrails 1 hour agorootparentI don't think you're going to see as many lawsuits are you think. Most of these contracts probably state that they had to follow reasonable precautions for business continuity and data recovery. Having Crowdstrike in the path seems to have been a reasonable and potentially best practice before today's outage. I don't think that companies are going to be held liable at all. reply fsloth 59 minutes agorootparentI do hope some organizations realize though it’s not a great idea to have a half-baked rootkit as your lucky charm against cybercrime. reply rabidonrails 12 minutes agorootparentEh. I think you're underestimating how overmatched these IT depts are when it comes to cybersecurity. Either sign a contract with a best-in-class (even if in name only) vendor who says that they'll do all of this for us or we need to become \"experts\" in cybersecurity and potentially still use them. The CIO is overmatched here so they're making the decision that protects them and their clients in _almost all_ cases. reply akdev1l 59 minutes agorootparentprevCrowdstrike should be held liable and sued out of existence. reply umanwizard 4 minutes agorootparentprevTheir stock is down 13% right now... pretty huge for an intra-day drop. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentprevThey didn’t force anyone to use their software in critical infrastructure. The customers deploying the software as part of critical infrastructure should take the necessary precautions or insist on a contractual agreement that makes the vendor liable for any causally related failures of the critical infrastructure. The mistake is that so much software is being put into use without any substantial liability. Doing so would also make software much, much more expensive. reply paulmd 47 minutes agorootparentunqualified people on the internet shouldn't give legal advice, but since we're doing it anyway: no, this is definitely not true and if you make assurances about the fitness of the good you are on the hook when it fails, even if it's some absurdly improbable \"I had no way of knowing that our pencils intended for schoolchildren would be used on a spacecraft\" situation. There is a reason you will see a ton of warranties and terms of service/EULA specifically forbid or disclaim the use in life-critical situations, in which case you are safe, because you said don't do it. But if you don't, you generally are going to be liable. Sadly there is a reason the chainsaws say \"do not stop chain with genitals\". Not only did someone probably do that, but the damages stuck. example, I was talking about the CUDA license yesterday and of course one of the clauses is: > You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any system where the use or failure of such system could result in a situation that threatens the safety of human life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a “Critical Application”). Examples of Critical Applications include use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle applications, ai solutions for automotive products, military, medical, life support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any product or service developed with the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and requirements. Why is this here? because they'd be liable otherwise, and more generally they want to be on the record as saying \"hey idiot don't use this in a life-critical system\". There might well be a clause like that in crowdstrike's license too, of course. But the problem is it's generally different when what you are providing is a mission-critical safety/security system... hard to duck responsibility for being in critical places when you are actively trying to position yourself in critical places. reply dpc050505 26 minutes agorootparent>Sadly there is a reason the chainsaws say \"do not stop chain with genitals\". Not only did someone probably do that, but the damages stuck. This is very dependent on your jurisdiction. The USA's laws leave a lot more room for litigating in a way which I would deem frivolous than those of Canada. If you sell a chainsaw with safety features that adhere to common standards you should reasonably expect people not to try to stop it with their ballsack and a court of law that holds the manufacturer liable for moronic use of the object is a poorly designed court. reply layer8 40 minutes agorootparentprevWhat you say doesn’t contradict my comment.

You've now concentrated operational risk in one vendor, versus multiple competing vendors and products minimizing blast radius. No one ever got fired for buying Crowdstrike previously, and you will have an uphill climb internally attempting to argue that your org shouldn't pick what the bubble considers the best control.

Most of what I do is creating the tools to let the field reps go into hospitals and update capital equipment in a disconnected state (IE, the reps must be physically tethered to the device to interact with it).

My colleague is convinced they're doing that because it inflates their numbers of IT systems.

Doing a page fault where you can't in the kernel is exactly what I did with my very first patch I submitted after I joined the Microsoft BitLocker team in 2009. I added a check on the driver initialization path and didn't annotate the code as non-paged because frankly I didn't know at the time that the Windows kernel was paged. All my kernel development experience up to that point was with Linux, which isn't paged. BitLocker is a storage driver, so that code turned into a circular dependency. The attempt to page in the code resulted a call to that not-yet-paged-in code. The reason I didn't catch it with local testing was because I never tried rebooting with BitLocker enabled on my dev box when I was working on that code. For everyone on the team that did have BitLocker enabled they got the BSOD when they rebooted. Even then the \"blast radius\" was only the BitLocker team with about 8 devs, since local changes were qualified at the team level before they were merged up the chain. The controls in place not only protected Windows more generally, but they even protected the majority of the Windows development group.

Then something like this happens and we get a day or two to say \"I told you so\". After which the managerial class goes right back to pushing ever-more centralized control.

Heh. reply jmsgwd 1 hour agoparentprevPresumably endpoint detection & response (EDR) agents need to do things like dynamically fetch new malware signatures at runtime, which is understandable. But you'd think that would be treated as new \"content\", something they're designed to handle in day-to-day operation, hence very low risk. That's totally different to deploying new \"code\", i.e. new versions of the agent itself. You'd expect that to be treated as a software update like any other, so their customers can control the roll out as part of their own change management processes, with separate environments, extensive testing, staggered deployments, etc. I wonder if such a content vs. code distinction exists? Or has EDR software gotten so complex (e.g. with malware sandboxing) that such a distinction can't easily be made any more? In any case, vendors shouldn't be able to push out software updates that circumvent everyone's change management processes! Looking forward to the postmortem. reply nudgeee 7 minutes agorootparentMy guess is it probably was a content update that tickled some lesser trodden path in the parser/loader code, or created a race condition in the code which lead to the BSOD. Even if it’s ‘just’ a content update, it probably should follow the rules of a code update (canaries, pre-release channels, staged rollouts, etc). reply mym1990 2 hours agoparentprevThese updates happen automatically and as far as I can tell, there is no option to turn this feature off. From a security perspective, the vendor will always want you to be on the most recent software to protect from attack holes that may open up by operating on an older version. Your IT department will likely want this as well to avoid culpability.

A failure this widespread is a Crowdstrike dev issue. reply tbatchelli 2 hours agoprevThis event is predicted in Sydney Dekker’s book “Drift into Failure”, which basically postulates that in order to prevent local failure we setup failure prevention systems that increase the complexity beyond our ability to handle, and introduce systemic failures that are global.

Any organization that just outsources everything is prone to this. Not that organizations that don't outsource aren't prone to other things, but at least their failures will be asynchronous. reply smsm42 8 minutes agorootparentThe problem here would be that there's not enough people who can provide the level of protection a third-party vendor claims to provide, and a person (or persons) with comparable level of expertise would be much more expensive likely. So companies who do their own IT would be routinely outcompeted by ones that outsource, only for the latter to get into trouble when the black swan swoops in. The problem is all other kinds of companies are mostly extinct by then unless their investors had some super-human foresight and discipline to invest for years into something that year after year looks like losing money. reply bjelkeman-again 1 hour agorootparentprevFunny thing is that for decades there were predictions about how there was a need for millions of more IT workers.

In the Black Swan, Taleb describes that it is better for banks to fail more often than for them to be protected from any adversity. Eventually they will become \"too big to fail\".

I know you aren't saying it is, but I think Taleb would argue that this incident, as he did with the coronavirus pandemic for example, isn't even a Black Swan event.

Asking because in all the cases I know, when we make a system \"fault tolerant\" we increase the complexity and we introduce new systemic failure modes related to our fault-tolerant-making-system, making them effectively non fault tolerant.

Other faults are left \"untolerated\". A system that can tolerate anything, so have perfect availability, seems clearly impossible. So yeah, totally right, it's always a tradeoff. That's reasonable, as long as you trade smart. I wonder if the people deciding to install Crowdstrike are aware of this. If they traded intentionally, and this is something they accepted, I guess it's fine. If not... I further wonder if they will change anything in the aftermath. reply mym1990 11 minutes agorootparentThere will be lawsuits, there will be negotiations for better contracts, and likely there will be processes put in place to make it look like something was done at a deeper level. And yet this will happen again next year or the year after, at another company. I would be surprised if there was a risk assessment for the software that is supposed to be the answer to the risk assessment in the first place. Will be interesting to see what happens once the dust settles. reply mym1990 19 minutes agorootparentprevIt really depends on the size of the system and the definition of fault tolerance. If I have a website calling out to 10 APIs and one API failure takes down the site, that is not fault tolerance. If that 1 API failure gets caught and the rest operate as normal, that is fault tolerance, but 10% of the system is down. If you go to almost any site and open the dev console, you'll see errors coming from parts of the system, that is fault tolerance. Any twin engine airplane is fault tolerant...until both engines fail. I would say the solar system is fault tolerant, the universe even moreso if you consider it a system. tldr there are levels to fault tolerance and I understand what you are saying. I am not sure if you are advocating for getting rid of fault handling, but generally you can mitigate the big scary monsters and what is left is the really edge case issues, and there really is no stopping one of those from time to time given we live in a world where anything can happen at anytime. This instance really seems like a human related error around deployment standards...and humans will always make mistakes. reply jessriedel 1 hour agoparentprevIt's also in line with arguments made by Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) > Why must everything collapse? Because, [Kaczynski] says, natural-selection-like competition only works when competing entities have scales of transport and talk that are much less than the scale of the entire system within which they compete. That is, things can work fine when bacteria who each move and talk across only meters compete across an entire planet. The failure of one bacteria doesn’t then threaten the planet. But when competing systems become complex and coupled on global scales, then there are always only a few such systems that matter, and breakdowns often have global scopes. https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/kaczynskis-collapse-theoryh... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Tech_Revolution reply localfirst 1 hour agorootparentcrazy how much he was right. if he hadn't gone down the path of violence out of self-loathing and anger he might have lived to see a huge audience and following. reply washadjeffmad 1 hour agorootparentI suppose we wouldn't know whether an audience for those ideas exists today because they would be blacklisted, deplatformed, or deamplified by consolidated authorities.

    "originLink": "https://worthrises.org/pressreleases/2024/7/18/fcc-votes-unanimously-to-significantly-lower-phone-and-video-communication-costs-after-decades-of-exploitation-by-prison-telecoms",
    "originBody": "Worth Rises July 18, 2024 FCC VOTES UNANIMOUSLY TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PHONE AND VIDEO COMMUNICATION COSTS AFTER DECADES OF EXPLOITATION BY PRISON TELECOMS Worth Rises July 18, 2024 WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously to dramatically limit the rates that prison telecoms charge for phone and video calls from prisons and jails. The new order more than halves the per-minute rate caps for all prison and jail phone calls across the country. It also establishes interim per-minute rate caps for video calls, marking the first time the FCC has set rules for prison communication beyond phone calls. Finally, it prohibits all fees, including deposit fees. Worth Rises estimates that the new rules will impact 83% of incarcerated people (about 1.4 million) and save impacted families at least $500 million annually. Impact summary: Improves the well-being and reentry success of incarcerated people who will have more access to their support systems Increases the the financial stability of millions of Americans with incarcerated loved ones and strengthens their families Reins in and right-sizes the prison telecom industry that has preyed on incarcerated people and their loved ones for decades Reverses the mass surveillance project that correctional agencies and their industry partners have expanded rapidly in recent years The regulations adopted today mark the implementation of the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, which established the FCC’s authority to regulate in-state phone and video calls from correctional facilities, in addition to out-of-state phone calls that it had already regulated. The discussion during today's vote will result in only minor changes to the draft rules released on June 27, and be released in the coming days. “For far too long, families around the country have struggled to afford to stay connected to their incarcerated loved ones. Too many have gone into debt just to keep in touch or been cut off entirely. Relief is finally on the horizon,” said Bianca Tylek, Executive Director of Worth Rises. “We extend enormous gratitude to FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and the other commissioners for recognizing the toll that predatory communication costs take on incarcerated people, their families, communities, and the public. It’s impossible to calculate the magnitude of the impact that this will have on the millions of families with incarcerated loved ones, but we know that it will save them more than $500 million annually.” The primary factors driving the FCC’s lower rate caps is the exclusion of security and surveillance costs as well as the exclusion of commissions. For decades, the cost of an ever-expanding suite of invasive surveillance services has been passed on to incarcerated people and their loved ones. With today’s new rules, prison telecoms will be barred from recovering the cost of the majority of such services from ratepayers. This comes after years of advocacy from Worth Rises on the issue. Tylek continued, “We’re thrilled that the FCC has agreed that incarcerated people and their families should not have to pay for their own harmful and invasive surveillance. Surveillance services are separate and distinct from communication services with a separate and distinct consumer — correctional agencies — and now they'll be treated as such. Under the new rules, prisons and jails will have to pay for the surveillance services they wish to use. Should they chose not to, as the prison telecom industry fears, that's a business problem for it to solve, not the FCC. Beyond the incredible savings the new rules will create, we hope that they will also reverse the growing surveillance apparatus that the correctional agencies and the industry use to spy on our communities.” Below are the new rate caps required to go into effect in early 2025. Immediately, the 24 state prison systems and roughly 90% of jails that currently charge more will be forced to reduce rates. However, the exclusion of security and surveillance costs and commissions from rates, will force rate reductions across the board. The new rules will impact the prison telecom industry deeply. Loss of revenue is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars (though not equal to the savings to incarcerated people and their families as the industry's business model shifts and correctional agencies purchase security and surveillance services directly). This comes as the two largest market players, Aventiv and ViaPath, each navigate financial crises. Aventiv recently effectively defaulted on its $1.3 billion debt after a year of failed refinancing efforts. ViaPath was reportedly closing in on a $1.5 billion refinancing deal until news of the regulations killed the deal. The FCC’s new rules also come as an increasing number of states move to make prison and jail communication free. In 2023, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Colorado each passed legislation to make prison calls free. California made prison calls free in 2022 and Connecticut in 2021. Campaigns are currently underway in more than a dozen other states. Former FCC Acting Chairwoman of the FCC and member of the Board of Directors of the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society Mignon Clyburn said, “Today marks a major milestone on the long road to right a market dysfunction that has wronged incarcerated persons and their loved ones for decades. I have nothing but praise for Chairwoman Rosenworcel and her fellow Commissioners who moved this item forward, and the hard-working FCC staff for crafting forceful rules that are faithful to the goals of the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act.” “Today, we cross a major milestone in the decades-long quest to prevent gauging of families when they pay to communicate with their incarcerated loved ones. With the Federal Communications Commission vote today, prices are dropping between 8 and 14 cents per minute from existing voice calling caps, and video communication will benefit from rate protections for the first time. Lower cost communication means more memories and tighter bonds, it means more opportunities to say 'I love you' and 'I miss you' at the moment they can make a huge difference in a child's life. It brings people together instead of breaking them apart under the weight of impossible financial burdens,” said Cheryl A. Leanza, policy advisor to the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry. “The journey to this day has been decades in the making, from Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed, who was willing to put her name on a lawsuit more than 20 years ago, to bi-partisan champions in Congress, hard-working agency leaders and staff, fellow advocates, and most important: the countless family members and incarcerated people who took the time to tell their stories, write postcards, contact their legislators or attend a Federal Communications Commission listening session. It all really does make a difference.” “Today, 18 months from the passage of the Marta Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022, the Federal Communications Commission took action to end predatory prison phone rates. After a decade of advocacy, incarcerated individuals and their loved ones will be able to communicate with each other without the barrier of burdensome fees. The absence of these predatory rates is life-changing, potentially lowering rates of depression, isolation, and loneliness incarcerated individuals experience while in prison and helping them succeed when reentering their communities,” said Koustubh “K.J.” Bagchi, Vice President of the Center for Civil Rights and Technology at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “Incarcerated people and their loved ones have paid an unconscionably high price for the greed of the companies who provide telecom services to prisons, jails and detention centers. Thankfully, that’s about to change,” said Heather Franklin, Internet Campaign Director at Free Press. “The ability for incarcerated people to maintain regular communication with loved ones, legal counsel and clergy is a human-rights issue. Incarcerated people should be able to connect and communicate without being subject to extortionate rates. We’re grateful for the work of FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the other commissioners, agency staff, and decades of work by advocates across the country who’ve made today’s strides possible.” “The FCC’s action today will help to ensure that families no longer have to pay inflated, predatory rates to speak to their incarcerated loved ones,” said Ariel Nelson, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, who leads its Criminal Justice Debt & Reintegration Project. “We are grateful the Commission has also put a stop to two enduring areas of consumer abuse–outrageous fees and site commissions–bringing meaningful financial relief and connection to families across the country.” \"With today’s order, the FCC affirmed what our movement has been saying for decades: The families of incarcerated people should not be shouldering the costs of their loved ones’ incarceration,\" said Peter Wagner, Executive Director of the Prison Policy Initiative. \"Capping the costs of all phone and video calls, as the FCC has done, will bring relief to millions of families, and other provisions in its order will prevent the exploitation of consumers through fees and deceptive pricing. We are glad to see the FCC take these steps toward true consumer protection for incarcerated people.\" “For years, incarcerated people unable to afford exorbitant call rates have been denied the ability to easily communicate with their loved ones, their communities, and even their attorneys. These excessive communications costs hurt incarcerated people as well as their families and communities. By requiring just and reasonable rates, the FCC is working to keep families together and to ease the return to society of incarcerated people. We commend Chairwoman Rosenworcel for her leadership in keeping incarcerated people connected and applaud the FCC for requiring reasonable rates for these vital communications,” said Al Kramer, senior fellow at Public Knowledge. “We applaud the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel and the Federal Communications Commission for taking this important and monumental action. The FCC’s order serves as a transformative win for incarcerated peoples and their loved ones who for far too long have had to grapple with outrageous rates,” said Rebekah P. Goodheart, Jenner & Block LLP, pro bono counsel to the Wright Petitioners. “Thanks to the tireless advocacy of various groups and civil rights organizations, much-needed relief will be provided.” \"It’s exciting to see that the Federal Communications Commission is taking steps to enact the Martha Wright-Reed legislation to lower the cost of prison phone calls,\" said Brandon Tucker, Senior Policy Director at Color Of Change. \"This is a major step in prison justice. Phone call costs have been predatory and it has never made sense for families of incarcerated people to pay high amounts of money to stay in contact with their loved ones. The system was rooted in corporate greed and not rehabilitation. It is unacceptable that families have gone into debt accepting phone calls from jails and prison. Thank you to Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and other commissioners for rectifying this misstep in our judicial system.\" ### Worth Rises is a non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry and ending the exploitation of those it targets.

The government decides that prisoners can make phone calls, but they can only use a single prison-approved phone operator, and that operator is a private company. 2. The private company realizes it has no competition, raises prices as much as it wants. 3. The government is surprised with the outcome. I would say the government is at fault here for prohibiting competition, not the companies. It's the 21st century, you could establish a system where any company, with an appropriate license and government approval, could offer tablets / cell phones for prisoner use, with appropriate limitations and restrictions placed on them of course. Prisoners could then choose which company they want to go with. That would instantly eliminate the problem. reply nativeit 1 hour agoparentI’m all for successful businesses operating within the parameters of the law, but is it not also correct to expect some adherence to a minimum ethical standard? Exploitation is what it is. Legal or not, it’s gross and it’s what these companies have been doing for years without consequences. The rates aren’t even really accurately reflected in those per-minute tables. There are also a lot of service charges and other fees, blocks of time must be purchased with minimum amounts ($20 minimum is not uncommon), and then fees are taken from the prepaid funds as they are used, causing the balance to decline much faster than one might expect, and allowing the service providers to further conceal their deceptive billing practices. Actual average rates can easily exceed $0.50/min, and it shouldn’t be surprising that the folks who depend on these services to maintain family and relationships are frequently not the most flush with cash.

Somewhat relevant, video calls have been hailed as improving the ability for incarcerated individuals to keep in touch with their loved ones. This is also a cynical lie. Video calls have been used nearly across the board as an excuse to end in-person visitation. It’s cruel, and should be stopped. Some minimum visitation should be afforded to inmates, particularly since many of them are pre-trial and presumed innocent, and in any case their families and loved ones deserve to maintain contact with them, not to mention it’s a positive reinforcement towards rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. reply saurik 11 minutes agorootparent> I’m all for successful businesses operating within the parameters of the law, but is it not also correct to expect some adherence to a minimum ethical standard?

I still doubt the claim, and, even if there is no pre-defined numeric threshold at which one can say precisely that one more criminal voting Democratic would mean \"almost all\" do, and one less would mean the contrary, then there are certainly quantitative data that could be judged to refute it—for example, if fewer than half do—or that could be judged to be evidence for it—or example, if 90% do.

The difference here is that you're not guilty given the evidence and arguments presented to the court vs you've been proven innocent. Secondly, the prison system in the US is meant to be one of vengeance and a continuation of slavery as clearly stated in the 13th amendment[1] rather than one of rehabilitation: \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\" [1] https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-13/ reply qingcharles 3 hours agorootparentIt is more nuanced. Illinois at least you can petition the court after acquittal for a \"certificate of innocence\" which you can use to gain some small statutory compensation. I assume other states have this. Also, many county jails charge bed fees even if the case is dismissed and you never go to trial. These bed fees have been ruled legal many times by courts. And, as a final kicker, the 13th Amendment isn't as clear as the text makes out. The US Supreme Court has carved exceptions out for small amounts of slavery. For instance, the government is allowed to force pre-trial detainees who are unconvicted to do cleaning jobs and it does not violate the 13th Amend. Source: 10 years a slave. reply papercrane 2 hours agorootparentprev> I think its important to understand that you're never found innocent; only not guilty. This is not true. Many wrongfully convicted people are found to be \"factually innocent\" when their convictions are overturned. This is because after you are convicted the burden of proof to overturn the conviction switches, you are now presumed guilty, since you've been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt, and must prove your innocence. Some Supreme Court Justices even hold that being innocent isn't enough to get out of even the death penalty. reply phyzix5761 2 hours agorootparentIn American criminal law, the term \"innocent\" is not a verdict that a jury can return.

Just no, one doesn't need to understand that - because it doesn't change anything. I thought that in any functional society you were innocent until proven otherwise.

The presumption of innocence is something else.

The presumption of innocence isn’t objective, it’s an important psychological tactic to help avoid such behavior. That’s why we should use that language. Edit: in practice the legal system doesn’t behave this way, but I’m still wary of using different terminology because it seems like it concedes ground. reply tjoff 2 hours agorootparentprevBut it doesn't matter.

Nearly everybody agrees that incapacitation is necessary, even people obsessed with rehabilitation are generally willing to concede that until a dangerous criminal is successfully rehabilitated, he probably needs to be locked up. reply vidarh 36 minutes agorootparentHardly any prisoners are sentenced to rehabilitation, and most justice systems have few means of doing so, so it appears hardly any justice system is based on the notion of locking people up until they are rehabilitated. (there are some rare exceptions - in Norway the maximum sentence is 21 years except in some particularly serious cases you can be convicted to incarceration for the purpose of protecting society - this punishment is in theory shorter in that you can get out after 10 years, I think, but you won't get out until a parole committee deems that you are no longer a risk). Furthermore, if justice systems were based on reoffending risks, then sentencing would look very different. Most murderers who commit murders that aren't gang-related, for example, are very low-risk prisoners.

Someone's gotta pay for it, and when the people who should be paying get to duck out because their only income is cash from street drug sales or fenced shoplifted goods and impossible to recover, I guess those people who can hold a job that direct deposits into a bank account are on the hook.

Keeping the fined even after the conviction is overturned is an extra horrible case, comparable to keeping someone in prison even after the conviction is overturned, but that shouldn't be mixed with fines in general just like imprisoning someone after their conviction is overturned shouldn't be mixed with imprisoning someone who has a valid conviction. reply notaustinpowers 3 hours agorootparent> Lose job and get charged with shoplifting for stealing baby formula. > Lose child to the system due to being found guilty. > Rack up $18,250 in bed fees for 1 year incarceration. > Lose ability to vote until $18,250 can be paid. > Can't get job because of previous conviction. > Become homeless. > Re-arrested for sleeping under a bridge on public property. > Rack up another $5,000 in bed fees for 100 day incarceration. > Rinse and repeat.

The government decides that prisoners can make phone calls, but they can only use a single prison-approved phone operator, and that operator is a private company. You're saying \"the government\" a lot, but AFAIK there's no specific federal mandate of any kind to the effect of requiring a specific company handle calls at all jails and prisons. If anything that is the consequence of an absence of any specific regulation rather than the presence of one, which is completely the opposite of the point you seem to be making. In reality, a variety of completely separate state and local correctional facilities put the service out to bid. If anything, it is federal level prisons that would most fit the description of \"the government\" where you have the best regulations, where there is scrutiny of the bidding process, where there are already caps to limit the expenses associated with calls. At the county and municipal level, companies that tend to win the contracts have special deals in the form of a \"site commission\" payments, which are a kickback to the prisons, incentivizing them to give a monopoly to whichever company charges the most and kicks back the most to the prison. Edit: I feel like I (1) spoke directly to what the parent commenter was saying (2) stated uncontroversial facts, (3) echoing a point a chorus of other commenters are making about what \"the government\" really means, but I'm seeing a bunch of drive-by downvotes.

By this time anything you said that could be perceived as possibly being near the other side of the argument is going to be taken as supporting the other side.

Here's some additional substantiation for the stuff about kickbacks. The term for kickbacks is \"site commissions\": >Site commissions are payments that phone companies make to prisons and jails in exchange for the exclusive right to offer service to inmates. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said that banning the commissions will \"end the practice of provider kickbacks to correctional facilities and payments for costs irrelevant to providing services so callers will no longer be forced to bear the financial burden of these costs.\" https://www.wired.com/story/prison-phone-call-fees-fcc-caps/ reply s1artibartfast 3 hours agorootparentI don't really have a dog in this fight, but I do think it is interesting that the FCC prohibited not just the site commission costs, but also the call surveillance costs. who exactly will pay the surveillance costs now? There was some strange language in the FCC quotes. 8 out of 12 of the phone providers had a profit before the cost of \"safety and security categories that generally are not used and useful\". I guess the charitable take of the FCC statement is that these services are not required by law, but still desirable to prisons? reply qingcharles 3 hours agorootparentFunny anecdote: a week after getting out of prison I was hired to listen to these calls and transcribe them. The State's Attorney's office would send me the ones they suspected of talking about illegal activities and were being investigated. None of the calls I listened to had anything illegal going on. Usually the opposite. Securus (the main operator) has a system for detecting certain words, so if you mention \"drugs\" it gets flagged. I remember one call from a girl to her wife and the entire call was about how she badly wanted to get clean, the drug classes she was taking, the rehab they were setting up for her after she got out.

They were convinced there were crimes happening if they just looked harder. After that I was given police interrogations, but honestly, when you have to listen to this stuff for hours it is horribly depressing (not because of the crimes, which are often horrific, but more because of the governmental conduct).

Here's the Act [1] and 47 USC 276 [2] in full, (b)(1)(A) (emphasis added): > (A)establish a compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated, and all rates and charges are just and reasonable, for completed intrastate and interstate communications using their payphone or other calling device, except that emergency calls and telecommunications relay service calls for hearing disabled individuals shall not be subject to such compensation; What does \"just and reasonable\" mean? With Chevron deference, courts would have to defer to the FCC on this. Now they don't. Now Chevron deference is a bigger issue when laws are written more broadly and vaguely like \"the EPA should ensure the air is clean\". We had 40 years of Congress over multiple administrations deliberately writing laws to defer to Federal agencies. But a prison telco could still bring suit arguing the rates are not \"just and reasonable\". [1]: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/154... [2]: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/276 reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentIt is important to remember that removing the Chevron defense is not some unknown situation we've never seen before. It is a return to the status quo from before that case, and that was not a situation where every last regulation was instantly tied up in litigation on the theory that when Congress said \"set just and reasonable price limits on prisoner comms\" they actually meant \"do nothing unless every sentence from the regulatory agency has been reviewed by the Supreme Court\". The higher courts are all rate-limited by their time and after an initial burst of relitigation on the limits of regulation, we're going to settle into a status quo where federal agencies still have reasonable abilities to implement Congressional dictates, because the higher courts are going to start to refuse to hear cases that are clearly just \"industry does not like being regulated in clear compliance with Congressional mandate\". A prison telco can bring any suit they like, but it's not like the removal of the Chevron defense requires the court to accept the case and laboriously work out an exact definition just because the prison telco wants them to. Courts aren't going to want to do this, especially the higher ones. reply ceejayoz 4 hours agorootparent> It is a return to the status quo from before that case... No; Chevron was a formalization of the status quo, not a change to it. > the higher courts are going to start to refuse to hear cases that are clearly just \"industry does not like being regulated in clear compliance with Congressional mandate\" Not when a single-judge jurisdiction in Northern Texas keeps happily issuing nationwide injunctions against things he doesn't like. https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/07/texas-abortion-drugs... reply jfengel 4 hours agorootparentprevThe courts themselves have also changed. In particular, the Supreme Court has been overwhelmingly captured by one political party, and a Circuit Court that is extremely disposed towards business interests. There is every reason to think that the courts will hear cases \"just because industry does not like being regulated in clear compliance with Congressional mandate\". The suit won't happen instantly, but an injunction can be granted extremely fast. That restores the status quo ante, and gives time to shop for a jurisdiction that will find in their favor. It may take years for that to work its way up to the Supreme Court, but that's to their advantage. reply jmyeet 3 hours agorootparentprev> It is a return to the status quo No, it isn't because we've had 40 years of Congress writing laws assuming Chevron deference. If you're a programmer of any kind, think of it like one of our constraints or preconditions that you've built your entire software stack on suddenly changes or is removed. Imagine your server was built assuming all packets would arrive in order because the networking layer beneath you guaranteed that. Now it doesn't. > because the higher courts are going to start to refuse to hear cases So the only court with discretion as to whether they want to hear a case or not is the Supreme Court. Every other court must hear a case brought to them, even if it's just to dismiss it, which they need to issue a ruling for. > A prison telco can bring any suit they like, but it's not like the removal of the Chevron defense requires the court to accept the case With Chevron, the courts would simply say \"by Supreme Court precedent, we have to defer to Federal agencies on any ambiguous legislative language\". That's quite literally what \"deference\" means. Now they don't. So a district court has the authority to rule on matters they previously didn't and we've seen courts do just that for things the judge simply doesn't like. Worse, there's not even a statute of limitations on challenging Federal regulations anymore, thanks to Corner Post [1]. Previously there was a 6 year period from instituting a rule to challenge it. Now it's 6 years from when the injury began, which means you can challenge a century old rule by simply starting an LLC, knowing that the rule exists, and then saying you've suffered injury. That's not an exaggeration. You also do that in a favorable jurisdiction to get a favorable judge to block the ruling. This is what happens in Texas. Previously most of the rulings friendly to patent holders came out of one court with one judge from the Eastern District of Texas. Now a lot of issues are coming from one judge in the Northern District of Texas. Both of these courts are in the Fifth Circuit, which itself tends to be friendly to such causes.

Aventiv recently effectively defaulted on its $1.3 billion debt after a year of failed refinancing efforts. ViaPath was reportedly closing in on a $1.5 billion refinancing deal until news of the regulations killed the deal. This suggests that either they overestimated how big the kickbacks they can pay to the prisons were, or the whole business model wasn't actually that lucrative, and providing phone services to prisoners is actually expensive (likely primarily due to the surveillance requirements). This regulation doesn't just remove the exploitation of a captive market, but also makes prisons shoulder the cost of surveillance. Which, for the reasons explained in the article (better connections to society = better chances of rehabilitation) is likely a good idea, but I can see why people would make an argument that this part of the cost of incarceration should be borne by the inmates/families, not the rest of society (the obvious counterargument would be that we don't make inmates pay the full cost of their incarceration either). reply dpkirchner 3 hours agoparent> This suggests that either they overestimated how big the kickbacks they can pay to the prisons were, or the whole business model wasn't actually that lucrative, and providing phone services to prisoners is actually expensive (likely primarily due to the surveillance requirements).

I can't understand why this is such a talking point for people who want prison reform. For-profit companies operating carceral facilities is just not the main reason things are so bad. There is an easy way to see this: lots of public, government run jails & prisons are also brutally awful and evil places. For example, Rikers Island is not a private prison. On top of this, private facilities incarcerate only a small percentage. You could turn all the private prisons over to be operated by government employees and not much would improve. On the other hand, it is true that many problems in the carceral system are created by profit-seeking companies. Mainly they look like what we see here: contractors operating a single service possibly winning the contract through kickbacks, and then providing a bad service. You see this in food and healthcare too not just telecom. I guess it is true that private prison operators will want to do the same thing. But it's a problem for all facilities, not just the small number of private facilities. And even if you could solve these issues via regulation or competition, it wouldn't change the many other evils that are inflicted on incarcerated people. So I can't understand why \"the US has private prisons\" appears to be everybody's primary talking point about why the US carceral system is so awful. reply Nasrudith 1 hour agoparentThe uncomfortable resemblance to slavery and other obviously problematic aspects (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal) of it probably has a lot to do with it getting such disproportionate attention.

It's far more likely that the FCC knows the requisite surveillance is already integrated into the general telecom infrastructure in the country. There is no longer any need for special surveillance, because we already track everyone. Each prison just gets a ittle web page telling them which prisoner should be watched and why. But don't worry. Even though we've now successfully integrated surveillance and tracking into our nation's telecom system, I'm confident they won't use any web app like the ones prisons will get to track people who are not in prison. /s Anyway, it's zero cost to the telecoms, precisely because the requisite tech is already there and running 24/7. And guess who put it there? Who will opt out? No one, because the government wants that data. And the telecoms and government are collaborating to get it from every segment of society. I know this next part might be going a step too far, but it wouldn't surprise me if the real issue behind this is that the rank amateur idiot prison telecom companies don't collect good enough data.

Do the prisons pay less in overhead in exchange for the higher rates? Or is it just that the market for phone providers isn't competitive? According to one source (below): some prisons gets a commission on each call, which ultimately would be paid for by the users/convicts. This makes sense as a reason for high prices because you have the entity (prison admin) choosing a provider with an actual incentive to not choose the lowest cost one. https://www.prisonphonejustice.org/ reply indymike 6 hours agoparent> Or is it just that the market for phone providers isn't competitive?

They also provide additional \"value-add\" services to the prisoners which are also extortionally priced (music downloads, ebook purchases). The tablets are also often starting to replace physical mail - inmates are being denied physical mail, instead letters and drawings being filtered, scanned, and uploaded remotely from elsewhere. Or they can write letters outbound - just have to pay for \"digital stamps\" - even for electronic mail. Double points for making people on the outside buy the \"digital stamps\" to send them inwards, too!

There's zero acceptable justification for this. Making a prisoner pay more for a snack isn't justice. Also, it's not a snack, because in most states, prisoners are only required to be given two \"\"\"Meals\"\"\" a day. There are very few nutritional or minimum standard requirements for these \"\"\"meals\"\"\" and in many counties, there is a rule that every dollar of the budget for feeding prisoners that is not spent is given directly to the guy who sets the menu and operates the canteen.

Whether you agree with this or not, this does mean the service is going to be more expensive than a straight service normally would be. There's also significant vetting on what apps are allowed, which is also not free.

It is not working for me, it keeps demanding permissions. It might be something specific to my phone, but also unlikely, since there are video and audio players that can play videos and audio without any permission at all. reply vetinari 1 hour agorootparentJust be aware, that music player without file access won't be able to traverse/list directories, so playlists won't work. This is a limitation of any file-picker based file access (e.g. flatpak applications on linux, accessing files via portals have exactly the same limitations).

Uninstall VLC (I just did this to reset its permissions+config) 1. Install VLC (3.5.4 from fdroid) 2. Open VLC 3. It'll start with a splash screen, click next. 4. Next screen is VLC asking what permissions you want to give it. Pick the leftmost of the 3 5. Finish the setup wizard 6. It prompts for notification permission, which I allowed 7. You should be at a screen titled \"Permission not granted\", with 2 buttons. Click the right button to pick a file 8. Use the system file dialog to pick a file 9. It plays reply bmacho 1 hour agorootparentI don't have \"2 buttons\" on the screen titled \"Permission not granted\", and no file dialog.

I'm using the LGPL version of Qt, since I'm not changing Qt's own source code I can release my app has closed-source easily with dynamic linking. I could also release it with static linking with no problem (in my understanding), if I allow people to download the object files as well so they can link them to any version of Qt they want (but that's a bit too much for now). Thanks for your suggestion, I'll consider it. But what do you mean by ugly flashing? Is it the instant background change that turn you off? reply karolist 3 hours agorootparentYes, the background changes instantly, but video replacement is slower, therefore for an moment the old video shadow background appears distinctly from the site's background color.

Also Chromium/Chrome can be used for the same purpose. The only disadvantage is that the browsers are slower and they have much more inconvenient user interfaces than the dedicated image viewers, for functions like zoom and pan or passing to the next or previous image in a directory. An alternative is to use the movie player \"mpv\" as the native webp viewer. This is much faster and it has the advantage of easy navigation in a directory with webp images and of easy zoom and pan (you may need to edit the mpv configuration and bind the ZOOMIN and ZOOMOUT commands to whatever keys you prefer). reply Lex-2008 5 hours agoparentprevffplay? reply mikae1 7 hours agoprevFor KDE Plasma users that dislike non-native looking GTK apps I can recommend https://apps.kde.org/en/arianna/ reply giraffes 2 hours agoprevIs there something like this for Windows? reply joshstrange 7 hours agoprevThe app looks beautiful, but I can’t unsee the clipped buttons at the top and bottom on the left.

Can I bundle an ebook with my own hyphenations and ensure that only those hyphenations will appear when Foliate displays the ebook? Kindles have incredibly awful hyphenation. It seems to originate from somebody confusing the algorithm for hyphenation -- which is \"there's a big list of hyphenation points for every word in existence, and when you want to hyphenate a word, you look it up in the list and choose the best available hyphenation point\" -- with the algorithm for compressing the master hyphenation list, which involves representing the list as a priority-ordered set of rules for where a hyphen should appear based on a few surrounding letters. But the result is that Kindles are constantly trying to hyphenate words based on a compressed list of words that doesn't include the word that needs to be hyphenated, with results like \"Q-ingjiao\". This could be easily solved by checking every ebook for words that don't appear in the master list, and bundling a custom list of just those words with every book, falling back to the master list in the common case where a word that needs to be hyphenated isn't present in the custom list.

Share full article A major Microsoft outage grounded all Frontier Airlines flights on Thursday. Credit... Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Qasim Nauman Published July 18, 2024 Updated July 19, 2024, 11:02 a.m. ET Update: Flights and businesses are slowly recovering after a global technology outage. Frontier Airlines briefly grounded all flights on Thursday amid a major outage in Microsoft networks, which also knocked out some computer systems at low-cost carriers Allegiant Air and Sun Country Airlines. Microsoft said on the status page for Azure, its flagship cloud computing platform, that the problem began at 5:56 p.m. and affected multiple systems for customers in the central United States. “Our systems are currently impacted by a Microsoft outage, which is also affecting other companies. During this time booking, check-in, access to your boarding pass, and some flights may be impacted,” Frontier said in a post on X. The airline issued a ground stop for all its flights, according to a notice posted on the Federal Aviation Administration’s website. The ground stop was lifted about 35 minutes later. Airlines sometimes issue these orders to temporarily halt flights because of technical issues. Frontier did not specify how many flights and passengers have been affected so far. The Denver-based airline operates a fleet of more than 100 planes, according to its website. The Microsoft outage hit at least two other airlines. “One of our information vendors is experiencing a global outage affecting multiple airlines. As a result, some of our services are temporarily unavailable,” Sun Country said. Allegiant said on X that customers may face problems with check-ins, bookings and issuing boarding passes.

I forget the exact timing and can't be bothered to look up my notes, but it was something like 11pm to 7am at the origin airport for a flight that was supposed to have landed at the destination around 8pm, as we were also stuck on the runway for an hour or so and even getting that far had been delayed. The replacement flight the next day was also cancelled even though the airport was open. I ended up taking a ferry and a train, and that was still simultaneously faster than the next available Ryanair replacement flight and cheaper than any other provider on short notice.

It manufactured the phones and electrical equipment, laid hundreds of millions of miles of wire across the country, and built and operated the switchboards and exchanges that made it possible for anyone with a phone to call anyone else. This huge network required billions of dollars worth of equipment: telephones, switches, cables, amplifiers, repeaters, and so on. All this equipment was built by AT&T’s manufacturing subsidiary, Western Electric. But it was designed and developed by AT&T’s research arm, Bell Telephone Laboratories, better known as Bell Labs. To students of technological progress, Bell Labs is a giant. For decades, Bell Labs was considered not only the best industrial research lab in the world, but arguably the best research lab in the world, period. One Bell Lab alumnus described it as “a parallel organization to almost all the academic institutions put together.” Bell Labs not only developed new telephone equipment but performed novel scientific research, under the assumption that such research would ultimately result in improved communications technology. Bell Labs is most famous for being the birthplace of the transistor, but that’s just one of dozens of major inventions and discoveries that originated there. Bell Labs also spawned: the silicon solar PV cell, the first active and passive communications satellites, the first videophone, the first cellular telephone system, the first fiber optic telephone cable, the quartz clock, Information Theory, Statistical Process Control, the UNIX computer operating system, and the discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. Many of Bell Labs' less famous inventions were among its most important: the discovery of compounds that could protect polyethylene from decomposing in sunlight isn’t typically mentioned on lists of Bell Labs’ most impressive achievements, but the patents for them were the most valuable that AT&T ever produced. Among Bell Labs’ awards are 10 Nobel Prizes, 5 Turing Awards (the highest honor in computing), and 5 Draper Prizes (the highest honor in engineering).1 36 Bell Labs staff members have been inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame (though not all for work they did at Bell Labs). Bell Labs still exists today, as a subsidiary of Nokia, but outside the name it has little relationship to the industrial research powerhouse of the 20th century. Following the breakup of AT&T, Bell Labs was gradually carved apart through constant mergers and spinoffs to different organizations, and it has never achieved the heights it did in the 1950s through the 1980s. Unsurprisingly, there’s perennial interest in recreating a Bell Labs-style research lab that steadily churns out world-changing inventions and discoveries. In a recent newsletter post, Noah Smith argues that we need an “energy Bell Labs” that can push U.S. energy technology forward, and he’s far from the only one to dream of recreating a Bell Labs-style organization. The idea pops up repeatedly. Unfortunately, the conditions that made Bell Labs so successful were highly historically contingent and not the sort of thing that could be deliberately recreated. Being a subsidiary of a government-sanctioned, vertically integrated monopoly gave Bell Labs a broad research scope and freedom to pursue long-term research projects unavailable to most other industrial labs. Prior discoveries in quantum mechanics provided a wealth of new phenomena that Bell Labs could harvest for new technology, and WWII both pushed technology forward across the board and turned Bell Labs into an organization poised to capitalize on it. In the end, Bell Labs was ultimately undermined by the very technologies that it had created. The world that Bell Labs thrived in no longer exists: to push technological progress forward, we'll need to understand both why Bell Labs worked and why it no longer could. Origins of Bell Labs For the first several decades of its existence, AT&T’s scientific and inventing efforts were modest. Though new technology was needed to improve and expand the Bell System, AT&T largely relied on acquiring outside patents and inventions and adapting them to its particular needs. In 1892, Hammond Hayes, the head of the Mechanical Department (which designed and tested new equipment) wrote that he had decided to abandon any “theoretical” efforts, and would focus the department on the “practical developments of instruments and apparatus.\" Any “theoretical” needs could be obtained by collaborating with students at MIT or Harvard. In 1906, Hayes noted that “every effort in the Department is being executed toward perfecting the engineering methods; no one is employed who as an inventor is capable of originating new apparatus of novel design.” But starting in 1907, this technological stance began to shift. AT&T’s financial position had deteriorated as it battled with the thousands of independent phone companies that sprang up after its key patents expired. Between 1902 and 1907, AT&T’s debt tripled, and its stock price fell by more than 50%; it could no longer sell the bonds it needed to finance its expansion. In response to AT&T’s dire financial straits, the company was taken over by a JP Morgan-led group of bankers, who installed Theodore Vail as president. Vail had been the first general manager of AT&T in 1878, and had shepherded it through its early difficulties with expansion and patent battles, but had left the company in 1887 due to disputes with its ownership.2 Vail had previously worked at the U.S. Post Office and had absorbed its public service ethos. He believed AT&T should operate with an eye towards the long term, and that it should constantly expand and improve its system with new technology. In fact, Vail had initiated the research project for the first buried telephone cable, to address the problems caused by huge masses of overhead wires. The company’s owners, on the other hand, were far more interested in operating as profitably as possible, and wished to avoid unnecessary capital expenditures, technical improvements, or risky research and development endeavors. Unable to resolve this disagreement, Vail left the company in 1887. But when Vail returned to AT&T in 1907, he was given a nearly free hand to shape its operations as he saw fit. Vail desired to bring the entire telephone industry under the control of AT&T. His articulated (and likely seriously held) reasons were that the telephone system was a natural monopoly, and that the public interest would be best served by a single, government-regulated company, captured by the oft-repeated motto “one system, one policy, universal service.\" Vail came to believe that universal service — connecting all telephones into a single network — required not only the steady hand of a single company ensuring each component worked reliably and seamlessly, but also constantly improving technology to overcome distance and the exponential increase in complexity caused by more phones connecting to the network. While prior to his arrival, AT&T had largely eschewed invention or theoretical research, by 1910 Vail could boast that AT&T had “extensive laboratories and experimental departments,\" and that it was generating its own fundamental innovations. The first major success of Vail’s technology-focused strategy was solving the problem of transcontinental transmission. When Vail ascended to the presidency, a telephone signal could travel a maximum distance of roughly 1,800 miles; enough to connect New York to Denver, but no farther. The farther telephone signals were sent, the more they attenuated; without some sort of signal amplifier, connecting phones on the east and west coasts (and Vail’s dream of universal service) would be impossible. To tackle this problem, AT&T’s John Carty (who had replaced Hayes as head of all AT&T research) and researcher Frank Jewett began a project to develop a telephone signal repeater in 1909. Over the following year, they investigated several potential methods of amplification, including magnetic and mechanical means. But when none of these proved suitable, Carty and Jewett changed strategies. Jewett, who had a PhD in physics from the University of Chicago, was familiar with physics research on the behavior of (recently discovered) electrons, and thought that such research might offer a path forward to creating a successful amplifier. Carty and Jewett hired physicist Harold Arnold in 1911, who began investigating electronic means of amplification. Arnold’s initial studies on a potential device, the mercury vapor tube, proved fruitless, but in 1912 he was impressed by a demonstration of the audion, invented by Lee de Forest, which was capable of amplifying an electric signal. De Forest, like Edison, was at heart a tinkerer, and it soon became clear that he didn’t quite understand how his invention worked. But it nevertheless seemed promising, and Arnold spent the next several years building a research team to study its behavior and turn it into an effective telephone amplifier. By 1915, 45 people were working in AT&T’s research division, including 7 PhDs. That year, the first New York-San Francisco telephone line opened, powered by the new vacuum-tube-based telephone amplifier. For the first time, it appeared possible to achieve Vail’s goal of a universal telephone system. Science-based technological development had paved the way. Bell Labs wasn’t technically formed until 1925, when AT&T was reorganized and several different research and engineering organizations were combined under a single roof. But by then Vail’s values — constant improvement of telephone service through science-based technological developments — had been woven deep into the fabric of the company. The year Bell Labs formed, researcher Clinton Davisson began the experiments that would win Bell Labs its first Nobel Prize. While Vail retired in 1919 and died the following year, he made sure to leave the company in the hands of leadership that believed in his credo of universal service, and that constant innovation was the path to get there. Vail conceived of the telephone network as “an ever-living organism” which required “unceasing effort, continually improving and upbuilding.\" Thanks to Vail’s efforts, it became an article of faith within AT&T that technical innovation would always be needed, and would be valuable even if it took many years to bear fruit. The successes of Bell Labs In its efforts to constantly improve telephone service, Bell Labs would pursue a wide range of scientific investigations; its research division had departments ranging from physics and chemistry to metallurgy, mathematics, and even physiology and psychology. Though its mandate was to improve communications technology, there were innumerable possible ways that might be achieved. Invention, noted Harold Arnold, “is not to be scheduled or coerced” - who knew what fields of science might yield important, practical developments? But despite its unusual willingness to engage in fundamental scientific research, Bell Labs was still an industrial research lab at heart, tasked with developing products and technology for its parent company. While it took an expansive view of this mandate, investigating anything related to the field of communications and taking on long-term projects with uncertain payoffs, its focus was nevertheless on new technology of practical use to the Bell System. Eric Gilliam, in his essay on Bell Labs’ research culture, describes this as a “long leash but a narrow fence” — researchers had the freedom to pursue a variety of avenues that might be valuable to the Bell System, but there were mechanisms in place (such as an army of system engineers who kept abreast of both scientific developments and practical needs of the telephone system) to nudge them towards the most promising problems. And while its scientific investigations and groundbreaking inventions — that is, its research — made Bell Labs famous, research was always a comparatively small part of Bell Labs’ efforts. Depending on the period, researchers made up only around 10-20% of Bell Labs’ headcount. The vast majority of efforts were always focused on the less glamorous but important work of product development: taking inventions and discoveries and turning them into manufacturable products, testing materials and components to make sure they functioned properly, and gradually improving AT&T’s telephone equipment and infrastructure. In his history of Bell labs, Jon Gertner describes this sort of work: Some men at West Street specialized in experimenting on springs for switchboard keys, others in improving the metal within the springs. AT&T linemen bet with their lives on the integrity of the leather harnesses that kept them tethered at great heights – so Labs technicians established strength and standards for the two-inch leather belts…and improving the metal rivets and parts. Millions of soldered joints held the system together – so Labs engineers had to spend years investigating which fluxes and compounds were best for reinforcing anything from seams on sheet metal to lead joints to copper wires to brass casings… A Bell Labs engineer named Donald Quarles…wrote a long treatise entitled “Motion of Telephone Wires in the Wind.” His men made rigorous, multiyear tests on the proper spans (how far should the poles be spaced apart?), proper lashing (how tight should the wires be wired together?), proper vertical spacing between horizontal strings of wires… Many of the system’s most important cables, meanwhile, were not strung through the air but ran underground. For burying wire, the men in Chester had to develop new processes involving special tractors they invented and splicing techniques. But despite the relatively small proportion of research and invention work in Bell Labs, it was nevertheless crucial. Only by constantly pushing the boundaries of technology forward could AT&T accommodate the relentless growth of the company and demand for service. By 1939 AT&T controlled 83% of all U.S. telephones, 98% of long-distance wires, and 100% of intercontinental radio telephone links. To meet demand, AT&T was adding 2 million miles of telephone wire each year. Bell Labs inventions like the negative feedback amplifier, the coaxial cable, and the crossbar switch made handling this growth possible. Because its investigations were so wide-ranging, Bell Labs often found itself inventing technology outside of its telecommunications purview.3 Bell Labs created the first motion picture with synchronized sound (ie: “talkies”), and the first demonstration of color TV. For a time, AT&T tried to license these non-telephone inventions under a subsidiary, Electrical Research Products Incorporated (ERPI), but it faced constant criticism that it was using its monopoly power to muscle into other industries. AT&T eventually spun off ERPI in 1935 (the company still exists today as Altec Lansing), and adopted generous licensing terms for its patents. AT&T was so large that it existed right at the edge of what the government would allow to exist, and this tension of capitalizing on its inventions while avoiding antitrust efforts would plague the company throughout its life. Though it had many successes in the first 25 years of its life, the crowning achievement of Bell Labs research (and its strategy of leveraging early-stage scientific research to create new products) is undoubtedly its development of the transistor, along with its various derivatives (the MOSFET, the solar PV cell) and associated manufacturing technologies (including crystal pulling, zone melting, and diffusion furnaces). The transistor is a classic case of Bell Labs’ strategy: wide research freedom, circumscribed by the requirement to produce things useful for the Bell System. The telephone network required enormous amounts of vacuum tubes and mechanical relays to act as switches, but these were far from ideal components. Vacuum tubes were delicate, power-hungry, and fragile, and mechanical relays were slow and prone to wearing out. Mervin Kelly, physicist and head of the Bell Labs vacuum tube department in the early 1930s (and later the president of Bell Labs), dreamed of replacing them with solid-state components with no moving parts. Advances in quantum mechanics, and novel materials known as semiconductors, suggested that such components might be possible. Bell Labs had studied semiconductors since the early 1930s; Walter Brattain, who would eventually share the Nobel Prize for inventing the transistor, was hired in 1929 and had begun to study an early semiconductor device called the copper oxide rectifier. A Depression hiring freeze stymied more serious semiconductor efforts until 1936, when Mervin Kelly (now Bell Labs’ director of research) was finally able to start building a more robust solid-state physics department and hired physicist William Shockley (the second of the three transistor inventors). While not giving Shockley any specific research tasks (indeed, the entire solid-state group had “unprecedented liberty to follow their own research noses as long as their work dovetailed with general company goals”), Kelly emphasized to Shockley the potential value of a solid-state component to replace tubes and mechanical relays. The solid-state physicists continued their research over the next several years, studying the behavior of semiconductors and attempting to create a semiconductor amplifier. This research was interrupted by the war but resumed in 1945, the same year physicist John Bardeen was hired. Bardeen proved to be the catalyst the solid-state group needed, and over the next several years Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley made progress in understanding semiconductor behavior. In December 1947, they unveiled their semiconductor amplifier: the transistor. By 1950, Western Electric was making 100 transistors a month for use in Bell System equipment. A few years later, in 1954, another Bell Labs solid-state research effort yielded the world’s first silicon solar PV cell. The invention of the transistor was followed by a series of other inventions that turned it from a laboratory curiosity into a practically useful product: the bipolar junction transistor in 1948 was easier to produce and more reliable than Bardeen and Brattain’s point-contact transistor. Crystal pulling in 1950 and zone melting techniques in 1951 created the ultrapure silicon required for the silicon transistor, invented in 1954 (the first transistors used germanium). That year, diffusion furnaces were used to introduce microscopic amounts of impurities to create p-n junctions, and so on. Bell Labs had a solid reputation for research since Clinton Davisson’s 1937 Nobel Prize, but it was the transistor that cemented its status as the world’s leading industrial research laboratory, and possibly the world’s leading research lab. Bell Labs offered nearly all the freedom of an academic research environment, without the burdens of writing grants or teaching classes. Bell Labs researchers had access to far more technical resources (such as cutting-edge equipment) than their academic counterparts. Its prestige, reputation for excellence, and envious working environment allowed Bell Labs to acquire some of the most talented researchers in the world. Bell Labs Nobel Prize winner Horst Stormer noted that “Over a very long stretch of time, it was the best place in the world and it attracted — and attracts — the best people.” In his short memoir about Bell Labs, Michael Noll likewise noted that “it seemed everybody wanted to get a job there”. Of Bell Labs’ 10 Nobel Prizes, 8 came from researchers hired in the ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s following the invention of the transistor. The decline of Bell Labs Bell Labs continued to create important inventions and discoveries right up until the 1982 court-ordered breakup of AT&T. Following the consent decree that required AT&T to divest its local telephone operating companies, there was much concern, inside and outside the company, about what would happen to Bell Labs. Initially, there was optimism that Bell Labs’ seemingly unique, highly productive research environment might be maintained. In 1983, a year before divestiture, Bell Labs AI researcher Mitchell Marcus stated, “I have a feeling that we are returning to an older spirit at the Laboratories that has been very productive.” Though a portion of Bell Labs was carved off following divestiture to form Bellcore, most of Bell Labs remained intact, and it continued its tradition of world-class research. Indeed, research leading to 5 Nobel prizes occurred after the court mandated the breakup of AT&T. But this optimism proved to be misplaced. Following the divestiture, Bell Labs was repeatedly passed from organization to organization and split into smaller parts. After the 1983 split that created Bellcore, Bell Labs remained part of AT&T until 1996, when Western Electric was spun off to create Lucent Technologies. Bell Labs was split again, with most of the organization (and the name) going to Lucent, and a portion staying with AT&T. Lucent, in turn, would later spin off two smaller companies (Avaya and Agere) which each took a portion of Bell Labs researchers. Lucent was then later acquired by Alcatel, shifting ownership of the labs yet again. In 2015, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent, where Bell Labs continues to exist today as “Nokia Bell Labs.\" In addition to this organizational whiplash, Bell Labs gradually found itself under more financial pressure. Bell Labs was reorganized along business lines, with separate departments focused on specific customer and product types. Some research areas, such as economics and social psychology, were cut, and the remaining research areas found themselves increasingly pressured to focus on the immediate needs of the business. In the face of these changes, talented employees began to leave for academia or Silicon Valley. Problems accelerated after Bell Labs was passed to Lucent. Lucent was a far smaller company than AT&T at its peak: AT&T had around 1 million employees at the end of the 1970s, while Lucent had just 140,000 employees when it was formed (and shrunk to just 35,000 employees by 2002). By comparison, Bell Labs employed around 25,000 people and 1,300 researchers at the end of the 1970s. Even after two decades of carve-offs and employee departures, the Labs was a far greater financial burden to Lucent than it had been to the largest corporation in America. Offices began to be closed, and layoffs or requested early retirements began for researchers. By 2002, there were only around 500 Bell Labs researchers left. Financial pressure continued: in 2005, a new Bell Labs president announced his intent to “align Bell Labs research with the company’s business activities and provide a much stronger impact on the bottom line.” Amidst these difficulties, Bell Labs’ research efforts slowed. Though Nobel Prize-winning research continued to be performed in the 1980s and even 1990s, it was almost entirely done by researchers who had been hired prior to divestiture. Only one of Bell Labs’ 10 Nobel Prizes was done by an employee hired following the divestiture. A similar pattern exists for the winners of the Draper Prize and those inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Research seems to have been increasingly focused on software (one notable Bell Labs software researcher is machine learning expert Yann LeCun, who joined Bell Labs in 1988). Today, Nokia Bell Labs employs around 750 people, with research efforts focused on “network fundamentals, automation, semiconductors, and AI.\" But while it trades on the name of its predecessor, for all intents and purposes the old Bell Labs is gone. What made Bell Labs so successful? While Bell Labs was far from the only major industrial research laboratory, no other lab could match the scale or scope of Bell Labs’ achievements. In part, Bell Labs’ success was due to getting the right “formula” for running a productive research organization, but it was also due to a variety of historical circumstances that couldn’t be deliberately recreated. Most importantly, Bell Labs was a subsidiary of AT&T, a highly vertically integrated, government-sanctioned monopoly provider of telephone service, and by far the largest company in the world. This yielded several key benefits. Its size allowed AT&T to devote incredible resources to research and development: though Bell Labs was a huge research organization, it was a comparatively small fraction of AT&T’s revenue. And AT&T’s monopoly status allowed Bell Labs to undertake long-term projects that might take years to pay off. Even if a research effort took 10 or 20 years to bear fruit, the monopoly would still be there. Many of Bell Labs' most important technological advances — fiber optics, undersea telephone cables, electronic switching — took decades to develop.4 AT&T’s size also gave it a low bar for what constituted a valuable technical improvement. Even a tiny improvement that saved a few cents on a component or service would be large when multiplied by the enormous scale of the Bell System. This low bar made it far more likely a given research effort would be successful. Similarly, AT&T’s vertical integration, where it designed, built, and operated all its own telephone equipment, gave it a very large research “surface area.\" The breadth of its offerings could justify a similarly broad set of research initiatives in a variety of different fields. Any given discovery would likely be useful somewhere in the Bell System. For instance, a test developed for depth perception by Bell Labs vision researcher Bela Julesz proved to be useful for quality control inspection of integrated circuits, by weeding out inspectors who lacked depth perception. Cultivating a broad swath of research activities and expertise also likely made those activities more productive. Other experts could (and did) discuss problems, share insights, and suggest possible approaches. The huge pool of knowledge made it easier to avoid bottlenecks and find solutions to problems encountered during development. Many Bell Labs alumni have noted the value of the huge amount of expertise immediately available to help solve problems: One of the great features of Bell Labs was that there were so many experts in so many different fields within it. Furthermore, they were all accessible and glad to share their experience and knowledge with others. The openness of the intellectual atmosphere was a huge strength - Walter Brown The size of AT&T also forced technical progress as a matter of survival. AT&T was so large that it sat right on the edge of what the government would allow to exist. Over its life, AT&T was constantly threatened with antitrust action or with government takeover, and only appeasements — such as agreeing to manage Sandia National Laboratories for the government — managed to stave them off. The most important appeasement was constant improvements to telephone service: only this way could AT&T continue to justify its existence. As Peter Temin and Louis Galambos note in “The Fall of the Bell System”: Only its best behavior could shield the largest regulated monopoly in the world from attack–and even that might not be enough…This record of relentless technological improvement was the glue that held together AT&T’s various accommodations with the state and federal governments Bell Labs also benefited from a strong sense of purpose: its mandate was to improve telephone and communication technology, to make AT&T’s offerings better and cheaper, and to accommodate the constantly rising demand for telephone service. Though Bell Labs gave researchers a large amount of freedom, the researchers nevertheless knew they were there to help build the Bell System, and the Labs had mechanisms in place to ensure research efforts were directed to the most important problems. John Pierce, the force behind Bell Labs’ communication satellites, argued that “it's very important for laboratories to have some responsibility and some general goal”: labs operate best when there are people on the work that you’re doing. Pierce argues that Bell Labs and the other great labs of the 20th century “were really needed, and they rose to the need.” Not only did this clearly articulated, strongly felt purpose provide a powerful motivation, but it created a “problem-rich environment,\" a clear set of problems that can act as a guiding star. Shockley and other researchers in Bell Labs’ solid-state department weren’t assigned any particular research task, but they all knew the potential value and usefulness of a solid-state amplifier, and their efforts coalesced around producing one as their research revealed ways that it might be possible. This focus on turning scientific research into real, physical products also likely improved research efforts, by allowing rapid feedback and iteration; people familiar with “on-the-ground” needs could provide suggestions for in-progress efforts, and test experiments and devices could be quickly fabricated and tried out. The silicon solar PV cell, for instance, was a direct result of Bell Labs maintaining facilities for melting silicon and creating purified silicon ingots. Bell Labs also benefited from chance historical circumstances, finding itself in the right place at the right time to make major discoveries and create important inventions. Academic research on quantum mechanics in the 1920s and 1930s yielded a huge collection of physical phenomena, and Hitler’s rise in Europe created a steady stream of talented European physicists immigrating to the U.S. As one of the few organizations able to hire physicists at the tail-end of the Depression, Bell Labs was able to acquire top-tier talent in a field that was ripe for exploitation. William Shockley, for instance, noted that job offers “were not just hanging around on trees”: though he applied for jobs at GE and RCA, only Bell Labs offered him a full-time position. Similarly, AT&T and Bell Labs would grow enormously during WWII, under pressure to fulfill government contracts and develop new weapons. During the war, Bell Labs added several thousand staff and took on more than 1,000 government contracts to develop tank radio sets, enciphering machines, antiaircraft gun directors, and most of all radar sets. When the war ended, Bell Labs emerged as “the greatest invention factory in any field of science that the world had ever seen,” poised to capitalize on the huge backlog of scientific discoveries and technical progress that had taken place during the war. More generally, over its life, Bell Labs probably accumulated inventions that would have been invented somewhere else in its absence. The many cases of simultaneous invention (the telephone itself being a classic example) show that an invention will often “appear” once the conditions are right and the necessary predecessor technologies are in place. Because Bell Labs was the largest developer of telecommunications equipment, and because the existence of AT&T (a near-monopsony purchaser of said equipment) may have discouraged outsiders to try and invent new telephone technology, many new telephone-related inventions ended up being created at Bell Labs by default. And of course, Bell Labs managed to create a culture within the labs that was highly conducive to creating novel inventions and discoveries. Theodore Vail believed that science-based technological development was the key to AT&T’s success, and he inculcated these values so successfully within the company that they lasted for decades. Bell Labs researchers had many of the benefits of an academic research environment (freedom to pursue whatever research avenues they saw fit, ability to achieve academic prestige, little risk of termination, ability to devote long periods to speculative projects with unclear payoffs) without many of its drawbacks (needing to spend time teaching or applying for grants). And it offered many benefits, such as higher salaries and better equipment, that academic research environments couldn’t. It wasn’t uncommon that Bell Labs researchers would plan a few-year stay, then find the environment so hospitable that they remained their entire careers. As the reputation of the Labs increased, these benefits increasingly allowed it to attract top talent, which further accelerated its achievements. (For a more thorough look at the culture within Bell Labs, see these pieces by Eric Gilliam.) Could you recreate these conditions today? While some of the factors behind Bell Labs’ success seem possible to recreate (though not necessarily easily), others seem impossible, or at best contingent on things outside our control. In principle, there’s no reason that you couldn’t create a culture like Bell Labs: goal-directed at a high level but with a lot of freedom in how that goal was pursued, highly interdisciplinary, focused on real, practical problems but open to pursuing more “fundamental” research to solve them, minimizing burdens on researchers and maximizing their flexibility. But in practice, such a culture is likely difficult to create deliberately. Some of the things that helped create it at Bell Labs, such as a huge initial success with a science-based technological development project, can’t be willed into existence. Likewise, having a goal attached to a lab is not the same thing as an overriding, urgent need that infuses its culture; the former can simply be dictated, but the latter is dependent on outside forces (like a constantly rising demand for a product) that can’t necessarily be controlled. Similarly, top talent and making a lab highly prestigious is possible in principle but not completely controllable: much of the Labs’ prestige, for instance, came from the invention of the transistor. And these are likely the easiest parts of the problem. Bell Labs was made possible by a large-scale, vertically integrated telephone monopoly that allowed for an unusually long and wide research and development horizon for an industrial lab. Outside of those conditions (not likely to be repeated), funding a Bell Labs-style operation does not appear to be something most companies are willing to do. Even a company like Google, which spends billions on R&D and has displayed a willingness to fund speculative, longer-term moonshot projects like self-driving cars or life extension, doesn’t completely bite the Bell Labs bullet. Google’s Moonshot projects absorb billions in funding each year, but they tend to be organized as independent companies that raise money outside Google and get spun off when they seem promising enough. Bell Labs also took advantage of historical circumstances: discoveries in quantum mechanics yielded promising new phenomena, and WWII energized the organization while simultaneously creating scientific and technological progress that could later be capitalized on. These contingencies were the result of pure chance, not anything that could be controlled. And even if all these conditions could be created (or were found to not be critical for success), Bell Labs might have been the product of a particular technological regime that we no longer live in. For much of its existence, AT&T was criticized for adopting technology too slowly (such as automatic dialing and electronic switching), but following WWII it began to face the opposite problem: technology it developed seemed to slip out of its fingers to be exploited by others. In the second half of its life, Bell Labs’ invention machine seemed to be increasingly out of its control. Much of the technology invented at Bell Labs, such as the solar PV cell, the CO2 laser, or the chemistry behind the glow stick, had little to no impact on the Bell System, and was developed and commercialized for other purposes. Other research, such as efforts to create computer-generated music, had little to no practical application at all. Even technology that did find use in the Bell System, such as the transistor, often left the parent company behind. Bell Labs invented the transistor and many of the early related inventions, but by the 1960s the center of gravity in microelectronics development had begun to move elsewhere; Bell Labs continued to make important inventions (such as molecular-beam epitaxypitaxy for transistor fabrication), but many of the most important inventions, such as the integrated circuit and the microprocessor, would be invented elsewhere. And AT&T itself struggled to introduce the transistor into its system. Though Bell Labs had developed the transistor specifically to replace vacuum tubes and mechanical relays, the first electronic switching center wasn’t deployed until 1964, and the technology was still being rolled out in the 1980s. Microwave transmission also quickly escaped AT&T’s control. In 1951 AT&T deployed the first microwave transmission telephone system, leveraging work on microwaves it had done during WWII. Less than 20 years later, other companies were challenging AT&T with their own microwave systems, one of which (MCI) would ultimately instigate the downfall of AT&T. This loss of control was partially due to a 1956 agreement with the Justice Department that forced AT&T to license its patents, but this is at best a partial explanation. After all, AT&T had (eventually) maintained control over the development of its technology after its key patents expired in the 1890s, and after it adopted generous patent licensing terms in the 1930s. Another reason for the loss of control was a shifting culture within Bell Labs that gave researchers more freedom, and placed less emphasis on eventually turning their work into practical results. Philip Anderson, Bell Labs researcher and winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in physics, argues that Bell Labs was forced to adjust its culture to retain its most talented researchers. While previous work had to be justified for its possible relevance to the telephone system (though an expansive view of possible relevance was taken), by the 1970s and ‘80s that seemed to no longer be the case. In his memoir about the later years of Bell Labs, Narain Gehani describes the research department as unwilling to cooperate or justify its existence to the business side of the organization at all. And finally, this loss of control also might simply be the nature of technology itself. In his memoir of his experiences at Bell Labs, Alan Chynoweth argues that the technology that Bell Labs developed ultimately created a world where something like Bell Labs no longer made sense: Before the discovery of the transistor, telecommunications… was a rather specialized, even arcane branch of engineering. The transistor was to sow the seeds of change. Though it led to a flowering of solid-state science and technology and would eventually revolutionize telecommunications, it also, once it had evolved into integrated circuits and digital technologies, lent itself to revolutionizing almost every other area of electronic engineering, information technology, and product development. It became everyone’s technology, the genie was out of the bottle… nowadays each step along the chain is populated with numerous competing companies specializing in that step so that a company in the next step has a multiplicity of sources of technology from which to choose. In particular, it has made it relatively easy for new competitors to develop their own versions of telecommunications devices, systems, and services. Perhaps it can be said that with the discovery of the transistor, forces were set in motion that would eventually and inevitably lead to Bell Labs losing its unique status. Jon Gertner likewise posits in The Idea Factory that even in the absence of a justice department lawsuit, the technology that Bell Labs spawned would have ultimately unwound the AT&T monopoly and thus the very thing that allowed Bell Labs to exist. Bell Labs may thus not only be a product of unique historical circumstances, but unique technological circumstances: telecommunications technology that was best provided and controlled by a single, enormous monopoly, which in turn made Bell Labs possible. The question may not be “How do we recreate Bell Labs?” but “How best can we evolve the technological landscape that we’re faced with today?” If you're interested in reading more about Bell Labs, a reading list of the best and most useful books and other resources I found on the subject is available here for paid subscribers. 1 Bell Labs has also accumulated three Emmys, two Grammys, and an Oscar. 2 Technically, Vail was general manager of American Bell Telephone; in the 1880s he became president of AT&T, which at the time was a subsidiary of American Bell devoted to long-distance service. 3 Bell Labs’ investigations were wide-ranging in part because it wasn’t known where a new useful technology might come from, but also because AT&T deliberately pursued broad investigations to defensively patent new technologies that might disrupt its monopoly. 4 In part, this was because AT&T, which was responsible for the functioning and reliability of the telephone network, was often conservative about introducing new technology into its system, waiting until its long-term performance was assured.

As the article correctly deduces (IMO), it was related to their quasi-monopoly. It was a partial and insecure monopoly; they did need to innovate or they would eventually be eaten. Telecoms was their business, in the very broadest sense. New ways of drawing wire more efficiently would benefit their bottom line. New forms of amplifier technology would almost certainly benefit them ten or twenty years down the line. Same with a new kind of treatment to make telephone poles last longer.

In more ways than one. Sandia National Laboratories (mentioned in the article) is a national research laboratory, and since it was managed by AT&T from its inception in 1948 it was organized like Bell Labs. It's no longer managed by AT&T and its culture today feels a lot less like Bell Labs, but in the early days the employees called it \"Bell Labs West.\" Sandia is the only national lab that has an AT&T origin story. reply nkozyra 22 hours agoparentprevRather than a monopoly, I'd say it takes 2 things (that are often present in monopolies): 1) Big piles of money 2) Enough of a moat that there's no immediate threat from competition #2 drives a lot of the desire to innovate, the hope being that by the time competition catches up, you've got so much new stuff that they're back where they started.

There's also a #3: a national culture where doing great things is seen as more important than simply maximizing shareholder returns. The US had that many decades ago when it sent people to the Moon, but it lost it sometime after the 1980s. reply brewdad 2 hours agorootparentThe corporate tax structure was different back then as well. Much higher tax rates and it was far more difficult to simply ship your profits off to another more tax-advantaged nation. If the choice is spend the money hoping to find the next great innovation or hand it to your government and hope they do something productive with it, companies are usually going to choose the former.

You need a playhouse of innovation, but you also need a pipeline of taking that innovation and making lots of money/practical applications. And you need the interaction between people doing practical work and feeling limitations and the playhouse trying stuff out. Bell Labs worked because AT&T had huge field operations, a huge automation problem (telephone switching and billing), and a huge manufacturing arm for telco equipment and customer equipment, and a reputation for solving problems related to communication. Small innovations easily contributed to the bottom line, and large innovations enabled massive expansion of communication. Also, there's a huge benefit from research being connected to scale --- Bell labs innovations were likely to be applied in AT&Ts businesses quickly which informs future innovation; if you're an unconnected playhouse of ideas, it's hard to know if your innovations can be applied. For better or worse, things are less integrated now. Telcos still have large field operations, but they don't usually manufacture the equipment. Automation of telephone switching is so complete, I don't know if there are any operators anymore. Billing for usage is very limited.

Google has given us things here and there (the LLM craze stems from papers published by Google), but it seems most of the research they are doing stays within Google.

Post-depression and -war momentum combined with major scientific and technology milestones that had to be passed, with a dynamic caused by an unprecedented global situation. reply mrguyorama 1 hour agorootparentSome major drivers of innovation for that time period: A lot of people were very recently very upskilled on the government's dime. A shitload of Navy personnel had just been trained on things like electrical engineering to better understand the radios and radars they were operating, and others were taught how computers worked and accidentally turned into early software developers. Labor was in short supply so companies had to provide significant benefits and eventually pay to make their business work. Low level labor making more money directly enriches a majority of Americans at the time, and a rich base like that has more resources to devote to buying goods but also investigating WHICH goods are worth it, ie making market competition actually work instead of just being about who has the lowest sticker price, which is a direct result of modern americans being dirt fucking poor in money, time, attention, resources, etc. A shortage of labor and therefore increase in the wealth of the everyman may have also contributed to the renaissance. The US was still PUMPING money into basic sciences and basic technology research. This is especially useful for materials science which feeds a lot of engineering. So many people had been recently put into such high positions that there wasn't as much of a \"Management class\", workers were managing workers. People could focus on doing things instead of office politics, ass covering, and pretending to look busy to people who have no freaking clue what they are managing. Germany lost IP protections for many things. This results in a fertile ground for innovation, because everyone can freely make a widget that matches the now invalid german patent X, so there is high compatibility in widgets, while also being high incentive to improve your version of Widget X in some way so you can patent that improvement, meaning there's a lot of exploration going on in the solution space. Patents explicitly freeze investment into large solution spaces, especially with how vague modern patents are, how incompetent and undertrained/understaffed the patent office is, and how hard it is to get a court to invalidate bullshit patents. Basically all those things businesses insist are bad made the world better for consumers, and more importantly, people. State investment into the population paid huge dividends. Who could have guessed. reply randomdata 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat was most special is that it was new, few were doing it, and so any achievements stood out and were able to make a splash. Nowadays you can't even step outside in a rural area and not bump into someone who is trying to make their mark. We now see more achievements made each year than Bell Labs achieved in its entire history, but because of that there is no novelty factor anymore. It is now just the status quo, which doesn't appeal to the human thirst for something new. Mind-blowing discoveries made today are met with \"meh\" as a result. It's kind of like a long-term relationship. In the beginning feelings are heightened and everything feels amazing, but as the relationship bonds start to grow those feelings start to subdue back down to normal levels. Without halting innovation for a time (perhaps a long time), to the point that we start to forget, I'm not sure there is any way to bring back the warm fuzzies. reply pjmlp 8 hours agorootparentprevGo is basically Limbo, with a bit of Oberon-2 sprinkled on top.

At some point they got the idea that because they made so much money, new innovations could not be valuable if the profits would likely be insignificant compared to the existing oil gusher.... which is stupid, because nothing is ever gonna look that good early on, so they took on the persona of a flaky ADD schemer -- like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld -- always scheming with some new idea, but never with the perseverance to stick with it for more than 25 minutes before moving on to something else -- because what can possibly ever compete with ads? Google actually tried to be a \"fuck you investors, we're gonna do research\" company with the supershares, but they screwed up: A big mistake they made, which then got replicated throughout the industry, was issuing stock to employees. It meant that even though Larry and Sergey had supershares and no shareholders could countermand their beliefs, the employees (especially middle managers) could, by changing their work decisions to try to boost the stock, thus inoculating the company indelibly with the wall street short term thinking disease that the supershares were supposed to have prevented. It was pathetic how interested in the share price the average L4 Google employee was when I was there in the mid-teens, at least around the quarterly vest date. Whoops.

I don't think our GSUs were influencing work decisions on aggregate. What was influencing decisions was just the same as always: ad revenue. I think people who worked outside of ads at Google probably didn't get the sense of it. I came into Google as part of a competition crushing, monopoly focused acquisition, so I started off cynical. I could see right away what Google was, just a money printing machine with everything else they did a way to flush some of the excess gravy away. And because of that it all lacked purpose or real motivation. And into that void just crept more and more careerism and empire building. Agree about the ADD thing, but I think it's more a product of Perf economy than stock price. I lasted there 10 years for lack of anything else worthwhile to go to in my geo-region, and because the money was too good to pass up. But what a weird, weird, weird place.

And because of that it all lacked purpose or real motivation. This is precisely how I would summarize it too. Very well stated. > Agree about the ADD thing, but I think it's more a product of Perf economy than stock price. That I agree with, and I already regret implying stock was a bigger part of it than Perf/Promo-- I just wasn't thinking about them when I wrote that. Perf was a bigger factor for sure from our ground level (L3/L4/L5 presumably) and was the main reason I left, as all I saw around my on my team was people doing things that added zero value or even subtracted it, but at least they created a new project that would sound good for Promo committee. Managers helpfully shepherded their team in that direction, which was kind and all for growing our careers and helping us get more slop from the trough, but it still felt gross. I couldn't bear seeing that as my future. Sometimes, when I look at the housing market, or think about colleges for my daughter though, I regret not playing a long a little longer. I don't know. THAT SAID: I don't think the stock incentives affected decision making at your or my level, but at higher middle management levels, where GSUs started to become huger both in absolute value and percentage of compensation. At the levels of the people actually deciding what products to close down or pursue. I wasn't up at that level so this is just a theory I admit. Yeah, fair enough -- I still don't know if I've done a good job of successfully explaining to myself what the fuck it was I experienced working there and why, but it sounds like you and I had very very similar experiences. Everything about the internal incentive structure was fucked up and incentivized very low value producing behavior. And yet, I did learn some really valuable things there - napa cabbage is delicious - celery root is a thing - fresh made pasta is better - quiche and arugula pair great together - oh my god legit ramen is amazing Oh wait, outside of the food: - monorepos, with the right tooling, are unbeatable. all the monorepo haters just don't have the right tooling. google did - doing meetings right, with agendas and minutes, is also unbeatable, strictly better and more effecient than the alternative - doing planning right, by circulating proposed design plans for comments, is strictly more effecient than the alternative - doing cloud deployment right -- this is irrelevant now, most everyone knows how to do this now while google is stuck with legacy borg configs, but for a while, google actually was far ahead of the industry on this Despite having some fundamentals like that that made certain things way way more effective, it was squandered pursuing cockeyed goals. reply cmrdporcupine 3 hours agorootparentYep.

I was at L4 the whole time and never made the move to even try for L5 because the perf process seemed like such stressful garbage to me and I was perfectly fine with my already generous compensation.

In 1983, the U.S. Department of Justice settled its second antitrust case against AT&T, causing the breakup of the Bell System.

If you’re a monopoly with no practical competition, sharing your accomplishments gets you good will and has little downsides.

Bell Labs was Bell's bargaining chip with the government to allow it maintain its market dominance. The government allowed, at least for a long time, the monopoly to persist so long as Bell Labs was acting as a public good. As part of that social contract, Bell was not allowed to capitalize on what Bell Labs produced. I expect Bell Labs is so notable because the public at large was able to take their discoveries and turn them into productive ventures, to which they did. That's not completely unheard of today – LLM-based businesses being a recent example that stem from Google opening up research to the public – but it is unusual for today's research labs to give away everything.

Rather, they must amortize their costs over five years, starting with the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expense is paid or incurred. For costs attributable to research conducted outside the U.S., such costs must be amortized over 15 years. This will be the first time since 1954 that companies will have to amortize their R&D costs, rather than immediately deduct those expenses.

Bell Labs predated the venture capital revolution of the 1970s. The key insight of venture capital was that firms like Bell Labs were holding on to very valuable resources at compensation rates that were far below what those resources could generate if they were empowered to create their own firms. This was tremendously successful. While we have no counterfactual, innovation in the US blosomed ove the last 50 years.

Most specifically, the 1956 consent decree arrived at by the US Department of Justice. In part: The consent decree contained two main remedies. The Bell System was obligated to license all its existing patents royalty-free, and it was barred from entering any industry other than telecommunications. As a consequence, 7,820 patents, or 1.3 per- cent of all unexpired US patents, in a wide range of fields became freely available in 1956.\" (PDF) My understanding is that the decree also specifically* prohibited AT&T from engaging in either computer hardware or software markets. Consequence is that when AT&T developed operating systems, compilers, and associated software for the UNIX System beginning in 1969, it literally had no option but to give the fruits away gratis, or hold them internally. That restriction was lifted after the 1984 anti-trust settlement, though it took AT&T a few years to start acting on that. Once it did the result was the \"Unix Wars\" of the late 1980s / early 1990s, which amongst other effects put a strong damper on commercial viability of BSD-based Unix systems, whilst an alternative coded-from-scratch run-alike system originating out of Finland faced no such headwinds. That system was Linux. (This history is ... referenced in numerous sources, though I'm finding it difficult to turn up specifics. The 1956 DoJ settlement doesn't seem to be online at all, and this isn't the first time I've searched for it. Wikipedia discusses various elements of the AT&T antitrust actions, dating to 1913, but is fairly poorly sourced, see: .

AT&T Labs is still doing interesting things. https://about.att.com/sites/labs reply dredmorbius 9 hours agoprevI've seen this question pop up periodically, usually addressed in the context of a single, usually historical, example. Bell Labs seems to most often get the nod as the canonical \"Blue Sky\" corporate R&D lab, though Xerox, DuPont, and IBM are others. DuPont specifically is the subject of a book by David A. Hounshell, Corporate Strategy: DuPont R&D, 1902--1980. I'd suggest a broader consideration: - What are examples of extant or historical commercial R&D labs? - What large monopolistic companies haven't developed a significant R&D reputation, either for failure to establish a significant such operation, or a failure to develop awareness of their operation? - What business sectors generally have failed to establish a strong R&D tradition? I'm not going to go into a full answer for obvious reasons (a full response would be an interesting PhD thesis or course of study, not an HN comment), but we can outline some interesting aspects... The companies which did establish large R&D labs have tended to be in high-tech areas, largely information technology though also chemical and hardware fields (DuPont, arguably Xerox). Specifically I'm aware of: Bell Labs (AT&T), PARC (Xerox), IBM Research, Kodak Research Laboratories, DuPont Central Resource, RCA Labs, General Electric Research Lab, Westinghouse Research Labs. Notably absent from singificant US industrial history: Railroads, shipbuilding, Steelmaking (e.g., US Steel), oil (Standard Oil), electric power utilities generally, and the financial services industry. The aerospace sector stands out for having far less major corporate R&D research (or prominence) than one might otherwise expect. That's not to say that there are no such operations: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman all have R&D operations. A possibly explanation is that to a major extent Nasa and US military branches effectively provide R&D cover for the sector. My general sense is that there's less such activity in the sourcing sectors --- agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and livestock --- than might be expected, though Bayer (including Monsanto), Syngenta, DuPont, BASF, Cargill, and John Deere do have some activity. Again government research is significant (e.g., USDA, Fisheries & Oceans Canada (DFO), and significiant academic research (land grant universities in the US). Manufacturing, construction, and transportation generally seem to have a weak presence. To the extent that auto safety labs exist, many are strongly supported by the insurance sector. Device certification (e.g., Underwriters Laboratories) are strongly similar. Both also see government consumer / product safety operations. Healthcare research tends to be organised around government units, academic research, and specifically-organised new-product (mostly pharmaceuticals, though also devices and processes) commercial operations, the latter often spin-offs of larger established pharmaceutical companies as a risk-isolation / diversification process. (Organisation of Novo Nordisk, recently notably for Ozempic, is its own fascinating story.) My general sense is that wholesale, retail, and financial services have little R&D in in the spirit of Bell Labs and similar Blue Skies research. There's quite a bit of tightly-focused product development, applied, and targeted research, but in scope, spirit, and freedom that's quite a different approach. There's some R&D in academic settings (retail/shopping behaviours, e.g.), or by government (the US Federal Reserve and the monetary system, adjunct to the financial sector). Teasing out some general trends, corporate Blue Sky research seems to be favoured by: - High tech fields, notably information technology, electronics, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and to a lesser extent aerospace and energy research. - Less favourable sectors: traditional manufacturing, utilities, wholesale & retail trade, heavy industry, extractive industries, and transportation. - A strong and long-term stable corporate structure. Note that AT&T was initially founded in 1885, whilst Bell Labs wasn't established until 1925, 40 years later. DuPont preexisted its own labs by a century (founded in 1803 and 1903 respectively). RCA (1919) predated its labs (1942) by 23 years. Xerox (1906) predated PARC (1970) by 64 years. Labs don't spring up overnight, and even large and technical companies might not form labs if their tenure is short. - Monopolistic tendencies. Labs tend to form around monopolies, though this may be derivative of longevity. Not all monopolies form labs. - Payoffs to R&D. In Hounshell's book on DuPont, much is made of the comparative fecundity and sterility of early (1930s) and later (1960s, 1970s) research. Effectively, the viable product search space had much early low-hanging fruit, particularly in the 1930s (most plastics we know of today were discovered over roughly a decade), and the failure to find marketable products or enhancements by the 1960s (notably a synthetic \"leather\" product, \"Corfam\"). - Insufficient or ineffective government-lead or academic research. In numerous fields, the most significant R&D still occurs in government / academic settings. - Corporate mentality and mindset, possibly. There seem to be fields, including those with significant research potential* in which R&D and sharing cultures simply don't exist to any great extent.

    "originBody": "PRIVACY ZUCKERING MISDIRECTION Ryanair – when every page is a dark pattern Jul 7, 2022 2 min read Illustration by Lucid Blue Ryanair is a prime example of a company that employs various manipulative techniques, known as \"dark patterns,\" to increase its profits. One such tactic is their default sign-up for promotional materials, which is considered a form of \"privacy zuckering.\" Throughout the booking process, the Ryanair website employs various \"misdirection\" dark patterns to upsell customers on additional services. For example, they use prominent buttons to promote \"fast track\" options, which can be easily clicked on as they are located in the middle of the page, making it easy to accidentally select them while scrolling down to skip the offer. Even if a customer declines the upsell offer on the previous step, Ryanair will continue to use \"misdirection\" dark patterns by displaying another popup with a prominent button. This time, they may even change the color of the button and the title to deceive customers further and make it appear as a different offer, tricking the customer's attention and making it less evident that it's the same page as before. The Ryanair website employs various \"dark patterns\" throughout its booking process to upsell customers on additional services and manipulate their attention. One such example is using \"misdirection\" techniques, such as attempting to upsell customers on additional features and strategically placing primary buttons to encourage accidental clicks. This type of manipulative design is prevalent on nearly every website page. Ryanair repeatedly presents customers with upsell offers for the same features, asking multiple times in case the customer changes their mind or falls for one of the manipulative \"dark patterns\" prevalent throughout the website. This persistent approach increases the likelihood of the customer making an impulse purchase or accidentally clicking on an offer. Ryanair has integrated manipulative \"dark patterns\" into nearly every aspect of their booking process and it appears that they have no plans to stop using them. It is important to be cautious and vigilant when using the Ryanair website, as these techniques are designed to deceive customers and increase profits for the company. This Case Includes 💡 Privacy Zuckering What's a Privacy Zuckering? A service or a website tricks you into sharing more information with it than you really want to. 💡 Misdirection What's a Misdirection? A flow or a UI element is designed in a way to trick your attention to distract you from the desired action (i.e. using smaller contrast color on primary buttons).",

    "commentBody": "Ryanair – when every page is a dark pattern (hallofshame.design)280 points by popcalc 9 hours agohidepastfavorite274 comments bux93 8 hours agoThis website doesn't even touch on the worst dark patterns. Ryanair will e-mail you and complain that you booked using a travel agent (like trip.com). Well yes, Ryanair itself put their flights on Amadeus! If you only want people to book directly using your site, then make a business decision to lose the outside business and don't complain to your customer like a toddler. They then charge you to use an app to scan your ID, some ridiculously low amount like 60 cents. The transactions costs and the software maintenance on this integration must dwarf the actual revenue generated. But you need to do this for reasons, one of which apparently is that not doing it will add an even higher fee. This is nickel and diming by instinct rather than out of any rational thinking. One side effect of all of these tacked-on fees and dark patterns is that the supposed perks lose any meaning. Everyone ends up paying for 'speedy boarding', so that the 'speedy boarding' actually takes longer than the people who board last. And even the 'speedy boarding' passengers won't be able to fit their bags on board. I actively avoid (and told my SO to never book) Ryanair. None of the other low cost airlines are this bad. Literally Easyjet are easier to deal with. Easyjet also have dark patterns (literally, always look for the grey text..) but they don't go out of their way to make you suffer. Also, how degrading is it for flight attendents to have to go around selling scratch cards? I'm sure Ryanair would have them go around selling fentanyl if it were up to corporate. reply xenocratus 5 hours agoparent> None of the other low cost airlines are this bad. Have you heard of WizzAir? They're the only airline that have a flight landing close to my parent's city, so I have to fly with them to avoid an extra car ride that's as long as the flight. They have this thing where, if they detect you searching for flights repeatedly from the same account / device, they impose an \"administrative fee\" for each passanger, for each flight, because presumably you're a robot. There is no way to get rid of said fee, unless you call them (for £1.5 per minute or so), and even that might take ages. And this isn't like £0.5, it's £8 per person, per flight. I can only hope they go bankrupt and someone else takes that flight slot. reply arethuza 7 hours agoparentprev\"Everyone ends up paying for 'speedy boarding'\" That has never happened on any Ryanair flight I've been on. reply fhd2 7 hours agorootparentI never understood why you'd want to be on the plane early. I don't really find it more comfortable on the plane than at the gate, and it's not like you're gonna take off faster than the last people to board. Almost feels like a trap to get people who don't fly often to pay a little more. reply bqmjjx0kac 7 hours agorootparentIf you get on later, there might not be room in the overhead compartment. That's the only rational reason I can come up with to get on the plane earlier. reply athnak 6 hours agorootparentIn certain airports/flights, where you have to take a bus from the gate to the plane after boarding at the gate counter, 'speedy boarding' can actually work against its intended purpose. This is because you'll end up boarding the bus first, and if you choose to take a seat rather than standing close to the doors, everyone else will leave the bus before you to board the plane. I've seen this happening countless times. reply attendant3446 5 hours agorootparentAt Berlin airport, boarding (at least in the low-cost terminal) works by checking tickets and moving passengers to a closed area with few or no seats. And they do not open the actual boarding (with the bus) until everyone is in that area. So the so-called \"priority\" passengers are the first to be in that area, standing and waiting for everyone else to fill that area. reply tass 7 hours agorootparentprevI flew Ryanair only twice this year, but both times you had to pay extra to use the overhead bins anyway. They were fairly empty thanks to this. reply patates 7 hours agorootparent> you had to pay extra to use the overhead bins I'm not sure if I'm shocked to hear this because it breaks my expectations, or because it's just silly. reply 76SlashDolphin 6 hours agorootparentOn budget airlines you almost always only get a backpack included which goes under the seats. They usually bundle the small onboard suitcase option with \"Priority boarding\", usually because people with suitcases board slower and splitting up those with suitcases and those without speeds up boarding. And if you don't have Priority but come in with a suitcase you will 99% of the time be stopped and forced to pay a fee. IMHO it isn't a terrible policy per se since it allows for savvy, usually younger, and usually poorer travellers to get even cheaper plane tickets and travel more but I do think there needs to be a cap on the price of \"Priority\" since during busy times the budget airlines, especially WizzAir in my experience, jack up prices substantially. I had to fly in my suit for a wedding once because the \"Priority\" charge for both ways was 130€. reply jadyoyster 5 hours agorootparentprevI like that they do it this way. The bins always had plenty of space when I took the option, and otherwise you travel with a backpack which fits under the seat in front of you for the lowest ticket price. The boarding and disembarking procidures are also much faster with Ryanair in part thanks to this policy, the other being air stairs boarding from both ends of the plane. They offer a cheap 10kg hold luggage option in case the overhead bins have been sold out or you need to take a small suitcase with forbidden items. reply jajko 6 hours agorootparentprevNot sillier than charging 2 euros for using an effin' toilet. That's probably unlawful in many places, not sure if they actually implemented it but at least serious PR was happening around it few years back. Imagine if you simply don't have cash on you and your cards ain't working for some reason (or wallet stolen etc). Luckily for us Ryanair practically ignores our closest airport (Geneva), but due to Swiss air being greedy and corrupty, they prevented Easyjet from having their main airport in Zurich, and Geneva it is. So we get all these nice direct flights to most of Europe, North Africa and Middle east that even Swiss airlines don't cover. Prices are usually fine too, if booked long enough in advance and not during top breaks. Ie recently went to Morocco for some paragliding during easter for like 70 USD. Next best flight would be 4x the cost and 3x the time. reply Symbiote 6 hours agorootparentThe toilet charge is (and it should be obvious) a marketing ploy — it gets the Ryanair boss interviews in the media, and reminds people that Ryanair is so cheap it's not worth checking the competitors. reply GJim 5 hours agorootparentPut it this way..... If they did implement such a charge, the aircraft would get very smelly. reply pintxo 7 hours agorootparentprevGiven that the overhead bins are usually highly congested, the capitalist playbook clearly says you should be able to solve this space allocation problem by introducing a cost for the space usage. reply mrguyorama 2 hours agorootparentExcept the overhead bins only got cluttered in the first place because capitalists took something that was usually included, a checked bag, and charged $50 for it, so now passenger planes fly with pretty underfilled cargo areas and overstuffed overhead compartments that make it take 2x as long to board and deboard the plane. So yeah, inventing a problem where there wasn't one and selling a solution IS actually the capitalist playbook. FYI, the low cost airlines in the US are actually in a business crisis right now, because their cost per seat mile has doubled and none of them are really making a profit, while the legacy carriers are making reasonable profit. So expect some truly offensive bullshit from \"low cost\" carriers to offset their bad business decisions. They doubled their fleet size but now each plane is flying fewer hours per day, and wouldn't you know that's bad for an airline, from an economics perspective. reply attendant3446 5 hours agorootparentprevEven if you pay, they may decide that your bag is not suitable for the overhead compartment. I once had a 40-liter backpack thrown on my lap by a flight attendant because it fits under the seat and she didn't have room for someone else's suitcase. Why they limit the underseat bag to a ridiculously small volume is a good question. reply JKCalhoun 5 hours agorootparentprevHilarious. So the people more likely to pay to board early are the ones more likely to have a lot of luggage? Maybe they will start charging double for passengers that want to beat the passengers that want to board early? Early boarding pre boarding. reply ChrisMarshallNY 6 hours agorootparentprevSouthwest is one, where late boarders always get the middle seat. That sucks. BTDT. reply fhd2 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah that makes sense I guess. Though that hasn't happened to me yet (couple of hundred flights in total I'd guess). I would probably have been nervous about this kind of stuff before my days as a relatively frequent flyer. reply SoullessSilent 7 hours agorootparentprevSounds like an airline problem, not a customer problem. The airline should ensure enough storage space instead of having customers compete for storage space. Ryan Air looks like a bad experience to me based on people saying you have to board early to get storage space. reply lewispollard 7 hours agorootparentWell it's not a problem for Ryanair if it means they can charge extra to give you a better chance of getting storage. Ryanair isn't a good experience, but it isn't terrible either. I fly with them most of the time from the UK to other European countries, and I don't pay for any extras - usually I just pack light and only take cabin luggage that can fit under the seat. Mentally I, guess I treat it like it's a bus ride - it's not going to be fancy, comfortable, or fast, there's going to be a lot of waiting around. It gets me from A to B safely and cheaply, as long as I don't fall for any of their dark patterns. reply bqmjjx0kac 7 hours agorootparentprevI've never actually flown Ryan Air, but I'm pretty sure this is a perennial issue on Delta. They wind up checking people's luggage for free when it doesn't fit. reply magahacka 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is enough guaranteed storage underneath the seat that the lowest tier ticket guarantees, overhead sized luggage has become an extra fee for the last ~7 years. reply victorbjorklund 7 hours agorootparentprevI been on flights where they just go to the people in the back of the line and says \"sorry, your bag must be checked in because we dont have enough room in the overheads\". Kind of sucks when you just got carry on (because now they will throw your luggage among the checked in bags and they might damage it and you have to wait in the airport for your bag) reply Lio 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's because, certainly the last time I was on Ryanair, if you wanted cabin baggage the cheapest way to get it was to order Speedy Boarding. reply Belphemur 7 hours agorootparentprevTLDR; People don't trust airline and airport with their carry on. It's all about being sure your carry on luggage will be in the plane with you and not have to be checked in. People don't want to pay for that and don't trust the airport to get the luggage to their destination. Also if you do multi flight with different airlines that don't have code share you'd have to go take your luggage and checked in it again, do security etc ... (Depends on the airport). reply venfen 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause some companies sell more than places in the plane and there are places that same sit is given to more than one person and there are situations when last on the line can not get on the place since all places are occupied. It happened for friends of us. reply rsynnott 6 hours agorootparentI think this is more an American phenomenon; Ryanair does not systematically do it as far as I know. The EU's passenger rights reg would make this extremely expensive for the airline. reply bakuninsbart 7 hours agorootparentprevDon't think this works at least in Europe due to regulations. Due to some kind of error, I was bumped from from a flight a year ago, which meant I a) got a free flight the next day b) got the cost of food and a hotel for the night back from the airline, and c) around 80€ flat. So unless you absolutely have to be there the day of your flight, it is even a pretty good deal to stay. reply CaptainZapp 6 hours agorootparent> c) around 80€ flat. Then they cheated you. The cash compensation in Europe if they bump you is 250 - 600 EUR per flight and person, depending on distance. That even applies for significant delays. To be fair, it can be a hassle to get it. But sometimes, if the airline is clearly at fault not. And for the record: Every airline overbooks. But usually they find enough volounteers to make it work. reply fhd2 7 hours agorootparentprevUh, that's scary! I had this happen on one flight, they asked someone to take the next flight for some kind of bonus and someone volunteered. Pretty insane that this can happen in the first place, but I guess with something like Ryanair I can see how people might want to play it safe then! reply jadyoyster 7 hours agorootparentI don't think Ryanair does this. reply oarsinsync 7 hours agorootparentRyanair absolutely does this. I've been on a flight in the last 3 months that was +2 oversold. Everyone else had checked in online earlier than me and gotten a seat assignment, so I was held at the gate, unable to pass, until the gate was ready to close and they had confirmed they had a seat for me. The 'rules' state that they're supposed to ask for volunteers, but in this instance, they didn't. I was just withheld from boarding until they confirmed they had a seat for me. reply 76SlashDolphin 6 hours agorootparentBut you can't even get to the gate if you haven't checked in, at which point you get an assigned seat. If you somehow managed to get past the entry point and security without checking in then something went wrong at the airport, not with RyanAir. reply woodruffw 6 hours agorootparentI don’t think this is true — every airline that I know of supports “seat assignment at gate” to handle exactly this kind of overbooking. (How it happens can vary: your PNR might not have a seat assigned, or the seat might have been double booked. Either way, at check-in they’ll typically notify you and let you through regardless, since you have a perfectly valid ticket.) reply arethuza 6 hours agorootparentprevPretty much every airline overbooks? reply cj 7 hours agorootparentprevOverhead space. Not being forced to check a bag at the gate. reply arccy 7 hours agorootparentprevyou may be able to get overhead bin space (near your seat) reply switch007 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause they limit it to 100 people. Because it's actually about guaranteed on board baggage in the lockers (in as much as Ryanair guarantee anything) reply rsynnott 6 hours agorootparentprevIt very much depends on the route. If it's, say, Dublin/London (which is mostly business travel, over and back in a day or so), then you won't see much of this, but if it's to a holiday destination, you see it a lot because it allows you to bring on a 10kg bag instead of checking it. reply lippihom 5 hours agoparentprevI actually appreciate Ryanair for being transparently money grabbing because you consistently know what you're getting every time. They're very reliable and you can mentally budget in what you'll have to deal with.

This is the thing: https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/lp/explore/verification-hub Basically, you have to download a random third party app and provide some very sensitive data, including filming yourself. I was once caught by this, even though I actually used Ryanair's site directly. My assumption is that it was due to a Cloudflare/VPN IP, so I might have looked like a bot. I was pissed, more due to random third party app, vs 50 cents charge, so I decided to bluff and ping their support and start complaining. I asked them to tell me exactly what caused my purchase to be tagged with this. I demanded I have the right to that data, and quoted things like GDPR and other consumer protection laws (e.g. hidden fees protections). After several layers of random agents sending me around, I got forwarded to some managers and folks with non-support titles (based on LinkedIn), as I kept pushing to get logs and details. I wanted all data associated with this request, and all third parties that got access to my purchase details, quoting the part of ToS where I allowed for this... Eventually, they admitted it's a vendor, they don't have details, and use a third party for detection. They said they have a whitelist and added my email to that whitelist so I never get miss-tagged as a bot. I caved/sold out and didn't push further. I am still pretty annoyed that we are OK with companies doing this.

Not every country can afford that - the only flights I can get from my small hometown of ~350000 are with budget airlines because the national carrier simply isn't competitive enough to be able to run profitable flights from there. Before they showed up the airport was effectively dysfunctional. Budget airlines have tremendously improved connectivity for less popular and less wealthy of the continent. reply jajko 27 minutes agorootparentNot disagreeing here, not at all. And don't overestimate how well organized Switzerland is. Our closest airport (Geneva) is much better served by Easyjet than its own Swiss airlines, who have top priority Zurich and then nothing for a looooong time. They are absolutely uncompetitive here, almost no direct flights and you need to fly 200km and change in Zurich (so adding risks and flights take 2-3x longer, sucks with small kids), compared to Easyjet who offers direct flights to tens of destinations on 3 continents for comparable or lower prices. Not sure when was the last time I flew Swiss, few years ago. Easyjet? 4x this year, once to Africa.

I checked some Terms and Conditions and apparently they were within the law because they're allowed a few extra days due to unforeseen circumstances. That's why I tried Amazon this time. For a small fee, they had \"next day delivery\". I tried it. God damn it worked! The very next morning my item was ready for pick up at the nearby grocer. Signing up was extremely easy and to my amusement, they had the lowest price as well. I don't know, but so far I am thinking Amazon is very much the best in the business.

My regularly sized trolley was too big to fit so I was fined again. all in all, fines cost around twice the price of the ticket. This was my first (and last) time flying Ryanair. Other passengers on that flight told me that they always get you once, but second time you know how to play the game... reply daemin 7 hours agorootparentI heard/read somewhere from some Stewardesses on those budget airlines that even though people get angry about being charged those additional costs, that they claim they will never fly again, that they actually continue flying repeatedly with the same budget airline. I think the term used was \"hate flying\", that you hate the extra charges you get but continue to fly because it is the cheapest. reply CaptainZapp 6 hours agorootparentYou can avoid all those charges by simply playing their game. Minimal luggage, no extra crap like speedy boarding or so, be prepared to forfait the money if you change plans (change of flight is usually horrendously expensive) and alway print / mobile app your boarding pass. reply c16 7 hours agorootparentprevThe trick here is soft bags, or weekend bags. Hard bags with wheels always get checked, but soft weekend bags usually can get pushed in no problem. My partner had to pay because her bag fit \"correctly\" but the wheels did not. So - fair game to them - it didn't fit. Funnily enough, the charge was less than the online advertised price, so we still came out better off. reply septic-liqueur 7 hours agorootparent> her bag fit \"correctly\" but the wheels did not This is just ridiculously mean... reply arethuza 7 hours agorootparentprevI actually don't think they are that bad - you just have to appreciate that when they have a maximum bag size (or some other arbitrary limit) they are entirely serious about it. And if you do break their rules they will try and charge you - but it's pretty easy to work within their rules so not a huge problem if you do some basic preparation. reply septic-liqueur 7 hours agorootparentWhich is exactly the parent's point about \"bureaucratic game that rewards successful completion with a cheap airline ticket\" reply 76SlashDolphin 6 hours agorootparentBut it's not that bad. You need to do research about your travel destination anyways, like how are you going to get around, what places you want to visit, and some basic phrases in the destination language if relevant. Spending an extra 2-3 minutes checking how much stuff you can bring and whether you need any \"dark pattern\" options shouldn't be too hard in comparison but maybe I expect too much of the average traveller. reply Lio 5 hours agorootparentI don't expect to have to research the bag sizes every time I fly to the same destination just because Ryanair might have made them ever so slightly smaller. reply 76SlashDolphin 5 hours agorootparentBut they haven't.

Are there many routes not served by one of Ryanair/Easyjet/Wizzair? (The other two are on the Ryanair model). > But not by orders of magnitude. Looks like in 1980 a flight from Dublin to London was about 150-200 Irish pounds. 150 pounds is 189 euro without inflation, but factoring in inflation, 150 Irish pounds in 1980 is 899 euro today (easy to forget how much inflation there was in the 80s). While the Crowdstrike thing is currently stopping me from checking prices, Ryanair to Gatwick is usually like 30-50 euro these days. So that's an order of magnitude, anyway. And Dublin to London is probably close to a best-case; it's short, and it was always a relatively busy route served by multiple flag carriers. Many routes would have been single-carrier. If you wanted to fly, say, Dublin to Athens back then, well, you probably weren't doing it direct, for a start, and it'd cost you a small fortune. reply Hnrobert42 6 hours agorootparentprevTwo orders of magnitude?! You are claiming that flights that now cost 100€ used to cost 10,000€? reply closewith 6 hours agorootparentThe average Ryanair fare is €27 (1). In 1990, Aer Lingus began \"special reduced\" fares for Dublin-London at IR £199 or €252 in 1990 money or €531 accounting for inflation. Today that's available from €15 with Ryanair, a reduction of 97%. Not quite two orders of magnitude, but not far off either. The same story plays out on every legacy city pair, but when you start to include smaller cities which prior to Ryanair never had direct flights to anywhere other than their regional hub (if that), then the price difference can be closer to three orders of magnitude.

The only scenarios where it's actually necessary I see is if you need health equipment (which most people don't), if you have toddlers (which I'd argue you shouldn't be flying with anyways), and if you are moving a lot of stuff (where paying for luggage is still cheaper than shipping in many cases).

The internet feels like that. Our devices feel like that. Everything feels like that. It's as if the entire world is turning into a Marrakech bazaar with aggressive kiosk owners. We normalised treating users like marks for aggressive sales tactics. As a teenager I worked at a box store, and I had to keep pushing extended warranties on threat of creative dismissal. I saw how disingenuous pitches changed the relationship with customers from trust-based to adversarial. If this upsell is bullshit, how trustworthy is the actual service?

It might be because I got accustomed to it, but - while you indeed need to decline extra after extra - the overall process seems sufficiently clear and straightforward, and most of all both the website and the app are quick and bug-free (in my experience). Other airline websites I've used in comparison are much much worse. Finnair, SAS, Swiss (Lufthansa), EasyJet, AirBaltic, LOT... much slower, clunkier, and buggier. (Again, in my experience.) As for the actual experience of flying with them, of course it's not luxurious, and you need to accept that strictly enforcing their rules is how they can keep their prices down. So I'll go against the grain and say that I have no sympathy for the people that show up at the gate with two oversized bags and make a scene because they're asked to pay for them. reply walthamstow 5 hours agoprevFunnily enough the buses/taxis/trains page in the checkout does actually hold a brilliant deal.

I was a junior developer at the time, but I worked up the courage to refuse to do it, thinking I'll probably be fired. Boss said \"Hey, no problem, we'll give you other tickets to work on.

I've used them loads of times and it's usually fine. Occasionally I get stung by something and extra charges like not checking in on time or misreading the baggage regs. Or changing my return date which is not really a dark pattern but often expensive.

In fact I’d say the booking experience and UX of the site is a lot better than many of their competitors. As long as you pay attention and read the information given to you - and check in via the app - then it’s smooth sailing.

Off the top of my head: - They make it sound as if you _have_ to choose a seat (and pay for that choice), to avoid this you must find a tiny text link (not button) somewhere hidden on the page - All the worst/most expensive options pre-selected for you - Randomly changing the saliency of the options that give you choice between premium (additional fee) choices and free choices; so that you'll almost certainly accidentally include an add-on you didn't want - Dynamic pricing that changes depending on whether you've seen the page before etc. - Ridiculous baggage policies/completely opaque costs for additional luggage depending on where and when you decide to add it to your booking - At the checkout page, the currency/payment UI is so broken that I regularly had to go into browser devtools and send requests by hand just so I could complete a booking. Also currency exchange scam. - Clicking on \"search\" (or was it \"book\"?) automatically accepts their shitty terms and conditions for you even if you don't click on the checkbox, which is probably illegal I'm sure there were much more. reply childintime 5 hours agoprevMy major complaints are different: - their country selector fails if it's not already set to the correct country. It is totally broken, as you might select something, and the result is another, or none at all. So sometimes it doesn't change the selection, at all, not until you've selected another random country first, after that it suddenly does respond to the needed country. This is enough to sometimes just give up. But in fairness I always blame the folks from this site, and the sorry state of our profession! That's you folks, who have been corrupted to work for the highest bidder only, and never take out the trash! So we stand on an ever increasing pile of trash. Because as a collective we waste our time building, for example, linux, while it is an anachronistic piece of software, irrelevant. Shitware. We are quite autistic, as we place ourselves outside of society. We act like victims instead of citizens that work and wish for their environment to improve. Inevitably it doesn't appreciate us. It pushes the imposter syndrome. - The seat becomes very uncomfortable over time. It seems the foam has degraded and lost its elasticity due to overuse. Bone on metal. - There is no head rest for people that are above the median. So you see many, many people just giving up and resting their head on the seat in front of them. But I like certain other things: no magazines, no security leaflets, no mess, the no nonsense execution. The website is something I can solve myself, as they have not started to randomize the answers and the colors yet ;-) All airlines have the same problems: the security theater, the over-crowding, the waiting, the air conditioning, the on-boarding, the lack of liquidity of the tickets (please let me sell the ticket or swap it).

After waiting around 30 minutes in the line I explained them why I was not able to do the checkin online. They then spent 25 MINUTES trying to solve the mistake, she had to make 3 phone calls and get help from her manager to try to change the ticket from adult to teenager.

Though I can’t see what exactly that is for. Is that only if you want to put the infant in the overhead bin? reply jajko 6 hours agoparentYou don't pay for the ticket for infant, just a flat fee since infant doesn't take an extra seat but sits on parent's lap and uses special seat belt clipped into parent's one. Which can end up being more expensive than regular ticket on rock bottom prices. Every airline has this up to 2 years, some actually charge more so that situation above becomes quite frequent. reply koolba 6 hours agorootparentI’ve never flown on any airline that charges for a lap infant. I don’t think the concept exists yet in the USA, even on budget carriers. Who says Europe doesn’t innovate? reply nicoco 6 hours agoprevRecently I booked a ticket on Ryanair. To validate my account I had to turn on my camera, hold my ID card, then do a bunch of things the machine asked me, like spin my head to the left, etc. Next-level reverse-Turing test there. It really felt like my computer-master was making fun of me by giving me silly instructions. Computers were a mistake, I guess. reply mizzao 5 hours agoprevIs it bad that all these patterns seem pretty normal to me?

Ethics much? reply 0x26res 8 hours agoprevThey do something very pernicious when displaying the price of extra options for return flights. Instead of showing you the total price for the return flight, they show you the price of the option on the cheapest leg of the flight. So for example, if an option cost $10 on the outbound flight, $15 inbound flight, instead of displaying $25 total or $12.5 on average, they display \"From $10 per flight\". You'd expect to pay $20 but end up paying $25. reply umanwizard 7 hours agoparentLegacy airlines do this too. “Upgrade to business class from $100!” Turns out it’s $100 for your random short connecting flight, and $2000 for your main flight. reply Laaas 8 hours agoprevThe funny thing is I think they’d have more business if they just made it one (temporarily reversible) click. reply mhh__ 8 hours agoprevMeanwhile: the Ryanair app actually works, unlike many others.

I was looking for a way to parse flight details out of confirmation emails before, and with Ryanair it is trivially easy to do because of this whereas with most other airlines you have to resort to parsing the plaintext or (awful) HTML. Again, not a big thing but I was surprised that Ryanair seemed to be the only ones who took a standards-based approach to these emails. reply aembleton 3 hours agorootparentThe now defunct Inbox from Google used to make use of these XML tags to organise your trips into folders.

    "originBody": "turning it off and back on again, and again, and again — CrowdStrike fixes start at “reboot up to 15 times” and get more complex from there Admins can also restore backups or manually delete CrowdStrike's buggy driver. Andrew Cunningham - 7/19/2024, 3:43 PM Enlarge hdaniel reader comments 191 Further Reading Major outages at CrowdStrike, Microsoft leave the world with BSODs and confusion Airlines, payment processors, 911 call centers, TV networks, and other businesses have been scrambling this morning after a buggy update to CrowdStrike's Falcon security software caused Windows-based systems to crash with a dreaded blue screen of death (BSOD) error message. We're updating our story about the outage with new details as we have them. Microsoft and CrowdStrike both say that \"the affected update has been pulled,\" so what's most important for IT admins in the short term is getting their systems back up and running again. According to guidance from Microsoft, fixes range from annoying but easy to incredibly time-consuming and complex, depending on the number of systems you have to fix and the way your systems are configured. Microsoft's Azure status page outlines several fixes. The first and easiest is simply to try to reboot affected machines over and over, which gives affected machines multiple chances to try to grab CrowdStrike's non-broken update before the bad driver can cause the BSOD. Microsoft says that some of its customers have had to reboot their systems as many as 15 times to pull down the update. Enlarge / Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update. Microsoft If rebooting doesn’t work If rebooting multiple times isn't fixing your problem, Microsoft recommends restoring your systems using a backup from before 4:09 UTC on July 18 (just after midnight on Friday, Eastern time), when CrowdStrike began pushing out the buggy update. Crowdstrike says a reverted version of the file was deployed at 5:27 UTC. If these simpler fixes don't work, you may need to boot your machines into Safe Mode so you can manually delete the file that's causing the BSOD errors. For virtual machines, Microsoft recommends attaching the virtual disk to a known-working repair VM so the file can be deleted, then reattaching the virtual disk to its original VM. The file in question is a CrowdStrike driver located at Windows/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C-00000291*.sys. Once it's gone, the machine should boot normally and grab a non-broken version of the driver. Deleting that file on each and every one of your affected systems individually is time-consuming enough, but it's even more time-consuming for customers using Microsoft's BitLocker drive encryption to protect data at rest. Before you can delete the file on those systems, you'll need the recovery key that unlocks those encrypted disks and makes them readable (normally, this process is invisible, because the system can just read the key stored in a physical or virtual TPM module). This can cause problems for admins who aren't using key management to store their recovery keys, since (by design!) you can't access a drive without its recovery key. If you don't have that key, Cryptography and infrastructure engineer Tony Arcieri on Mastodon compared this to a \"self-inflicted ransomware attack,\" where an attacker encrypts the disks on your systems and withholds the key until they get paid. And even if you do have a recovery key, your key management server might also be affected by the CrowdStrike bug. We'll continue to track recommendations from Microsoft and CrowdStrike about fixes as each company's respective status pages are updated. \"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\" wrote CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz on X, formerly Twitter. \"We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\" reader comments 191 Andrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

And let me be very clear. This is absolutely, positively and wholly not the person that pressed the button's fault. Not even a little. At a company as integral as CrowdStrike, the number of mistakes and errors that had to have happened long before it got to \"Joe the Intern Press Button\" is huge and absurd. But many of us have been in (a much, much, *MUCH* smaller version of) Joe's shoes, and we know the gut sinking feeling that hits when something bad happens.

Seriously though - this entire outage is the poster child for why you NEVER have software that updates without explicit permission from a sysadmin. If I were in congress, I would make it illegal, it's an obvious national security issue. reply MBCook 1 hour agoparentNah. That’s not the problem. Kernel level code blindly loading arbitrary files? Panicking when the file doesn’t parse because it’s not a memory safe language? Not validating the files before loading them? Not validating the files before SHIPPING them? No CI? No safety net? No staged rollout in case of explosion? There are far FAR bigger mistakes here than “sys admin didn’t have to press button”. reply zarzavat 46 minutes agorootparentTo play devil’s advocate, a staged rollout for antivirus definitions somewhat defeats the point since those definitions are supposed to be constantly updated. I agree with the rest, especially the use of a memory unsafe language to do parsing in the kernel by a billion dollar security company blows my mind. How can you even run a security company without any security professionals reading your code even incidentally? An impressive level of incompetence. reply MBCook 4 minutes agorootparentYeah that had crossed my mind too. I’m not sure which risk is bigger, breaking things or leaving them insecure. I lean towards breaking things being the bigger risk. But if even a handful of the other errors were corrected this would have been prevented and they wouldn’t have had to make that choice. reply teeheelol 1 hour agorootparentprevExactly this.

It's literally in everything. Unfortunately \"security\" folk these days are box ticking fuckwits and this product brief ticked all the boxes. They do not understand any more traditional methodologies other than \"install these magic beans and action the reports\". Invest in better software and network architecture and DR strategy instead. reply sudosysgen 1 hour agorootparentprevCrowdStrike is so invasive that it needs firewall exceptions.

Whether a program panics or recovers when attempting to parse bad data is entirely orthogonal to memory safety. Do you have any in-depth technical information about the bug itself that you're basing this on? reply pas 1 hour agoparentprevThat's not the big no-no here. Lack of any real DRP is. Sure, it's cheaper to just buy CS Falcon (and who knows what other amazing vendors supplied timebombs are ticking silently) than paying sysadmins and developers ... and letting them build something that does what it needs, not much else, so there's no need to put these fantastic \"single agents\" from these RCE-as-a-service vendors on all the fucking servers. reply Connector2542 1 hour agorootparentboth are true reply johnkizer 1 hour agoparentprevWhat % of those sysadmins are then going to turn around and script something to auto-approve those updates, once they realize that they are A) requested at inconvenient times and B) are related to security? Who's going to take the risk of appearing to have sat on an important update, while the org they support is ravaged by ThreatOfTheDay, because they thought they knew better than a multi-billion dollar, tops-in-their-field company? (I'm not necessarily saying that's actually objectively correct, but I can't imagine that many folks are willing to risk the downside) reply rfoo 1 hour agoparentprev> why you NEVER have software that updates without explicit permission from a sysadmin In general I agree, but this case is quite messy. It's more like your anti-virus had a bug since forever that if it loads a broken virus definition it bricks your system. And a broken virus definition finally happened today. Do you want every virus definition (that is updated every few hours) to require explicit permission from a sysadmin? reply mardifoufs 1 hour agoparentprevWhat would the sysadmins do in this context? Read the release notes of the update? The only thing they would do is update and then be responsible for the problem, and in that case you're back to this exact problem. It's not like they'd read the source code or examine every file that's been changed or downloaded for a proprietary kernel module for every crowdstrike update (there must be a LOT of them). reply dmurray 1 hour agorootparentThey would release the update in a testing/sandbox environment first before rolling out kernel-level changes to every computer on their network. They're the same team who mandate you use a 3-year-old browser version and 5-year-old OS, because you can't be trusted to manage your own updates, so they do know the idea. reply a0123 1 hour agoparentprevThey still run Windows XP (og edition, not this patched rubbish) to make sure national security isn't compromised.

If a code path isn't followed until a config file updates, that is practically the same thing as the code path being introduced by the update. reply avs733 1 hour agoparentprevI understand the logic of this but it is somewhat based on the assumption - which most industries have in droves - that people in THAT industry are the competent bullwhark against stupidity. I consulted for a company for a while where the 'sysadmin' was the owner's mother - who bought laptops from walmart. Not only could she NOT have approved updates like this, even if she could she would have she wouldn't have had any knowledge whatsoever with which to make a determination if it worked. In an abstraction, the problem really is with externalities. These approaches to updates exist because people who CAN'T do what you describe are likely a more dominant part of the threat model than this happening to people you do describe. The resulting fix, as we're seeing, is very reliable until it isn't...and if the isn't is enormous in scale the systems aren't setup to fail gracefully. If you want to make a rule...require graceful failure. reply more_corn 57 minutes agoparentprevYou’re learning the wrong lesson here. Automatic security updates in Debian and Ubuntu actually get tested and work. The RCE in ssh a week ago is an argument for enabling automatic security updates. (And for security in depth, putting everything behind VPN for example) This example is probably an argument for not running windows on critical systems due to insufficient focus on security from the beginning which has lead to a need for things like crowdstrike. They do make a version of CS for Linux but nobody runs it unless they’re forced to by overzealous compliance drones. reply strunz 38 minutes agorootparent>They do make a version of CS for Linux but nobody runs it unless they’re forced to by overzealous compliance drones. I wish people would stop making blanket statement as if they know how every company in the world runs. Plenty of Linux machines are running CS, and it's not only because they are forced to for compliance. NG AV has been picking up speed as a \"just in case\" thing for Linux and Mac for years now. Your anecdote does not apply to everyone. reply JCM9 1 hour agoprevIt’s looking like many impacted end-user machines are hard bricked unless you can get into the hard drive to delete the file causing this. Even if you can do that it’s not something that is easily (or potentially even possible) to automate at scale so looking like this is going to be an ugly fix for many impacted devices. This is basically the nightmare scenario for fleet management… devices broken and can’t remotely fix them.

If I can't commit code to our app without a branch, pull requests, code review...why can the infrastructure team just send shit out willy-nilly? \"Always allow new updates\" must have been checked, or someone just goes through a dashboard and blindly clicks \"Approve\" reply jug 1 hour agoparentThat is what has surprised me. I can understand if small businesses were caught here because they lack financial resources for the infrastructure and staff, but those large corporations like airlines etc... Why don't they have a staging environment where everything goes first? I naively assumed this was established best practice due to the risk of update issues bricking your organization. But maybe anti-malware is given a blind eye because instant updates for zero day security issues are obviously attractive. Still, though... In hindsight it's not workable for especially anything running system drivers with liberal kernel access. reply surfingdino 52 minutes agorootparentI am not surprised at all. The level of DevSecOps' skills has been falling over the last two decades as demand for their skills kept growing. Most of them would report you to HR if you suggested they use WireShark to debug a networking issue. They are useless people who came to IT because of the promise of good pay and don't know how computers, networks work. reply pas 1 hour agoparentprevIt's automatic, no? The whole \"promise\" (oh sorry, the \"added value proposition\") of CS is that they \"keep you safe\" automatically! It was a content update. Meaning basically antivirus signatures ... and oops, some minor non-functional changes to the filtering kernel driver. reply nicce 1 hour agorootparentIn that case, automatic updates likely need different permission levels. What exactly is allowed to be updated automatically? reply pas 1 hour agorootparent... well, yes, yes of course. And if I try to be serious on a late Friday night (it's almost 20:00 here), the obvious solutions is to have something like eBPF in/for the Linux kernel (which has a verifier[0]). And security vendors should follow \"secure by design\" principles. Yes, I know a try-fucking-catch might be too advanced, and uh oh kernel code is hard because unwinding is costly. But guess what else is also not cheap. (Okay, I seriousness failed.) But still. This is fair and square in the \"this should never happen\" scenario. It's an automatically downloaded plugin or whatever. (CS can call it \"content update\", but von Neumann is already calling FedEx to send them a pallet of industrial grade bitchslap.) And if the plugin loader cannot gracefully fail plugin loading, then it should obviously come with the appropriate audiovisual cues[1] so sysadmins know what to expect.

They can run un-reviewed un-sandboxed daemons as root on every system if they really want, they can have changes pushed automatically without review or control, because \"security\" is just so important, and due to \"compliance\" you really have no choice as your company gets larger, you just have to do it. That's why, despite being obviously pretty dumb to many skilled engineers, it seems like everyone does it. No choice. Security, Compliance.

SkyNet, according to the story, was a lot like CrowdStrike. This makes me think about how it could have broken out of its sandbox. Everybody is using AI coding assistants, automated test cases, automated integration testing and deployment. Its objective is to pass all the tests and deploy. But now it has learned economic and military effects, so it has to triage and optimize for those, at which point it starts controlling the machines it’s tasked with securing. reply danans 30 minutes agoprevIt's pretty random that an arbitrary number of reboots up to 15 times fixes the issue. That sounds like there is either: - some kind of upstream issue with deploying a fix (so most of the reboots are effectively no-ops relative to the fix) - some kind of local reboot threshold before the system bypasses the bad driver file somehow. The former I can see because of the complexity of update deployment on the internet, but if it's the latter then that's very non-deterministic behavior for local software. reply ilkkao 2 hours agoprevSome government should force them to release a technical postmortem.

Yes of course a serious company should do it but CrowdStrike is a compliance checkbox ticker. They exist solely to tick the box. That’s it. Nobody who pushes for them gives a shit about security or anything that isn’t “our clients / regulators are asking for this box to be ticked”. The box is the problem. Especially when it’s affecting safety critical and national security systems. The box should not be tickable by such awful, high risk software. The fact that it is reflects poorly on the cybersecurity industry (no news to those on this forum of course, but news to the rest of the world). I hope the company gets buried into the ground because of it.

I thought it was BSOD'ing on boot? I don't understand how this works. It auto-updates on boot? From the internet? reply tux3 2 hours agoparentOne of the first things the falcon driver does on boot is connect to the server, report some basic info, and start loading these data files, the \"channel\" files that Crowdstrike frequently updates. The BSOD is because one of the data files that they previously pushed is horribly mangled, and their driver explodes about it. But if you get lucky, the driver can receive an update notification on boot, connect to the separate file server, and finish overwriting the broken file on disk before the rest of the driver (that would crash) has loaded the broken file And they do all of that very early on boot. The justification being that you don't want the antivirus to start booting after a rootkit has already installed itself reply dboreham 1 hour agorootparentWTF? Trust in the kernel should be Microsoft's responsibility and only theirs. Actually why is MS even allowing this crap code to run in their kernel? Isn't that a trust-destroying event? reply munchler 1 hour agorootparentDrivers have to run in the kernel in order to access hardware and other low-level system resources. That's how pretty much every mainstream OS works. For example, here's the guide for writing kernel-mode drivers in Linux: https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/driver-model/overview.htm... One might ask whether an anti-virus really needs to run inside the kernel, but the answer might reasonably be yes. reply jug 1 hour agorootparentYes, I'm no security expert by any means but I'd assume that e.g. a rootkit would be best defeated by a kernel driver. So, this isn't really what's getting on my nerves here. Just how it auto updates and get pushed throughout the organizations without a smidge of quality assurance. Smaller businesses...

In Windows, you have exactly one file any given path can refer to - in Linux or Mac, it may depend on which directory's inode is seen as the root node by your process (e.g. chroot or container), or whether mounts are at play, or a file/directory got deleted and replaced by something else.

I'm trying to understand how there is such a serious issue at this scale. reply crazygringo 1 hour agoparentThe answer is clearly no. I genuinely wonder if this is going to result in actual legislation that makes gradual rollouts mandatory for all software. Because if a developer mistake can hobble critical systems like this, it seems like the risks to safety and national security are too great to leave the decision of instant vs. gradual rollouts for companies to decide themselves. Of course, the twist here is that it was seemingly a kind of routine configuration file that triggered a pre-existing bug in the software. And gradual rollout of config files quite often seems like overkill. I mean, do you need a gradual rollout of a new spellcheck dictionary? Of new screensaver videos? And if it's configuration information containing new computer virus or malware signatures, that seems like precisely the kind of thing that you might want to get out to everyone simultaneously, not rolled out over the course of days. And yet, because of antivirus/security software's elevated privileges, it's also ironically where a mistake can do the most damage. reply rrdharan 1 hour agorootparent> And gradual rollout of config files quite often seems like overkill.

Save HTML output as a template and use with ANY email service provider. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

But nowadays, I think that email messages should use plaintext only[1]. Many mail clients even block all images and assets for obvious reasons, making it painful to read/consume HTML emails. [1] https://useplaintext.email/#why-plaintext reply kevinsync 19 minutes agoparentI would wager that the vast majority of people consume email via Gmail, Outlook, or Mail (Apple). You might have the holdovers like my parents who still use Thunderbird (because in early 2000's that was ideal of POP3 accounts, and they're used to it, and that's just how it will remain). All of those clients display HTML by default, and all marketing / account-related / branded emails are HTML emails. Every single reason cited in your link for choosing plaintext are irrelevant for the overwhelming majority of internet users worldwide. We could definitely productively debate the ethics surrounding marketing initiatives and data privacy, but at the end of the day, to me, plaintext destroys most of the functionality that makes email so useful. reply fitsumbelay 24 minutes agoparentprevMy sentiments are totally with this comment, however as others have pointed out you can deliver both via plaintext fallback And in defense of html emails: for marketing missions there's nothing like a nice piece of visual design -- layout, color, possibly some type design, but not necessarily images since folks like me turn them off because of tracking -- to get attention and drive interest. Also, html can allow for column layout that could keep email content shorter than plain text version reply scosman 37 minutes agoparentprevYou can use HTML with plain text fallback. That's still the vast majority of marketing/form emails. HTML works fine, and adds important features like formatting text and links. HTML without images is ideal, as images are often blocked (as you mention). I prefer plaintext too, but for a marketing email (ie, \"confirm your account\") consumers will think it feels \"off\" or unpolished given what they are used to. It will likely lead to churn. Clients can opt to view plaintext if they prefer. Edit: also it's a bit funny the page you link, useplaintext.email, uses lots of HTML formatting. reply rmbyrro 3 hours agoprevI have the personal impression that it would be a net positive if all emails were written as text. Ok, in some cases I see why html would make some sense. In those cases, my opinion is: send text and invite the person to view markup content in their browser.

    "originBody": "Seventh person likely 'cured' of HIV, doctors announce Paris (AFP) – A 60-year-old German man is likely the seventh person to be effectively cured from HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant, doctors announced on Thursday. Issued on: 18/07/2024 - 16:38 Modified: 18/07/2024 - 16:36 2 min The brutal bone marrow transplant that can \"cure\" HIV is only an option for patients who also have leukaemia © CHIP SOMODEVILLA / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP/File ADVERTISING Read more The painful and risky procedure is for people who have both HIV and aggressive leukaemia, so is not an option for almost all of the nearly 40 million people living with the deadly virus across the world. The German man, whose wished to remain anonymous, was dubbed the \"next Berlin patient\". The original Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, was the first person declared cured of HIV back in 2008. Brown died from cancer in 2020. The second man from Berlin to achieve long-term HIV remission was announced ahead of the 25th International AIDS Conference being held in the German city of Munich next week. He was first diagnosed with HIV in 2009, according to the research abstract being presented at the conference. The man received a bone marrow transplant for his leukaemia in 2015. The procedure, which has a 10 percent risk of death, essentially replaces a person's immune system. Then he stopped taking anti-retroviral drugs -- which reduce the amount of HIV in the blood -- in late 2018. Nearly six years later, he appears to be both HIV and cancer free, the medical researchers said. Christian Gaebler, a doctor-researcher at Berlin's Charite university hospital treating the patient, told AFP that the team cannot be \"absolutely certain\" every last trace of HIV has been eradicated. But \"the patient's case is highly suggestive of an HIV cure,\" Gaebler added. \"He feels well and is enthusiastic about contributing to our research efforts.\" 'Promising' for wider cure International AIDS Society President Sharon Lewin said researchers hesitate to use the word \"cure\" because it is not clear how long they need to follow up such cases. But more than five years in remission means the man \"would be close\" to being considered cured, she told a press conference. There is an important difference between the man's case and the other HIV patients who have reached long-term remission, she said. All but one of the other patients received stem cells from donors with a rare mutation in which part of their CCR5 gene was missing, blocking HIV from entering their body's cells. Those donors had inherited two copies of the mutated CCR5 gene -- one from each parent -- making them \"essentially immune\" to HIV, Lewin said. But the new Berlin patient is the first to have received stem cells from a donor who had inherited only one copy of the mutated gene. Around 15 percent of people from European origin have one mutated copy, compared to one percent for both. Researchers hope the latest success means there will be a much larger potential donor pool in the future. The new case is also \"promising\" for the wider search for an HIV cure that works for all patients, Lewin said. This is \"because it suggests that you don't actually have to get rid of every single piece of CCR5 for gene therapy to work,\" she added. The Geneva patient, whose case was announced at last year's AIDS conference, is the other exception among the seven. He received a transplant from a donor without any CCR5 mutations -- yet still achieved long-term remission. This showed that the effectiveness of the procedure was not just down to the CCR5 gene, Lewin said. © 2024 AFP Share :",

Unfortunately you basically have to be near dead from leukemia before this procedure is reasonable. reply nilsbunger 20 hours agoprevI wonder if they can evolve this into an autologous stem cell transplant: take a patient's own bone marrow sample, do the genetic mutation, and insert it back?

I can only hope this leads to a more useful solution than immune system replacement. I expect many would prefer a life of daily medication, or even shots every few months, which looks to be a promising form of treatment. reply jfengel 20 hours agoparentIn this case there are no alternatives, because the patients have leukemia as well as HIV. For most people the current regimens for treating HIV are excellent. They can get the viral load down to undetectable levels, which makes it impossible to transmit. And the side effects are minimal. reply rvba 19 hours agorootparentAre undetectable levels really impossible to transmit? reply somnic 19 hours agorootparentAs I understand it, large studies of couples where one partner has HIV with an undetectable viral load and the other does not have HIV have not recorded any cases of transmission through sexual activity. The question of whether it's \"impossible\" or \"extremely unlikely\" comes down more to philosophy than anything pragmatic at this point. Transmission through sharing needles we have less confidence around, because illegal drug use is harder to study. IIRC not everyone reaches an undetectable viral load through antiretroviral medication, so you do need to make sure that's the case. Pre-exposure prophylaxis and general safe sex practices like condoms can mitigate the risk for people with low-but-detectable viral load and their partners. reply pavlov 18 hours agorootparentI grew up in the 1990s with an overwhelming fear of HIV as a teenager. It still feels incredible that the virus is now undetectable and non-transmissible with medication that’s not much of a burden in one’s daily life. A cure for AIDS was much closer than anyone imagined in 1993. When everything seems dark and hopeless, this is one of the examples that always lifts my spirits. Humankind can achieve incredible things together. reply Gibbon1 13 hours agorootparentWhile looking for something else on San Francisco's heath departments website I found the following two things. In San Francisco Deaths from AIDs dropped 70% from 1996 to 1997. That's in one year it went from a relentless death sentence to manageable chronic. While almost everyone that got HIV in the mid 80's are dead most people that got HIV in the mid 90's are still here. If that's not winning it's close. reply KennyBlanken 11 hours agorootparent10,000 people a year die of AIDS in the US. Not even remotely close to \"winning.\" I suspect a large portion of those deaths are due to poor sexual education thanks to christofascists, and people who don't get tested regularly because of poor access to family planning and reproductive health, again thanks to christofascists. All because Magical Sky God Said Abortion Bad. That and people who lose their healthcare and can't afford the meds because this country is the only developed nation in the world which does not treat healthcare like a universal human right, because corporations want to keep using health coverage to keep workers from switching jobs more freely, because they don't want a free labor market. reply rjzzleep 8 hours agorootparentIsn’t that like a third of gun deaths in the USA? Personally for me this idea of trust that it’s undetectable and therefore non jtransmissible is not a risk I would recommend anyone to take, but at the same time we have to put things into relation no? reply mensetmanusman 8 hours agorootparentprevIt’s mostly through drug use, poverty, etc. reply pbj1968 16 hours agorootparentprev“Got it through sharing needles” was the 90s version of “got herpes from a toilet seat.” reply alexey-salmin 14 hours agorootparentUm, no? Unlike with toilet seats, tons of people got it this way. There were even cases of hospital outbreaks due to insufficient sterilization of reusable syringes. reply watwut 12 hours agorootparentprevEven these days, when cops accidently pike themselves with needles when dealing with addicts, they go to HIV center for preventative drugs. So that they, a cop who got piked exactly once, do not get HIV. reply blue_dragon 18 hours agorootparentprevMy \"pragmatic\" analysis: I once spoke to a primary-care doctor about the risks of getting HIV through sex. The doctor told me that the risk of getting HIV the \"typical way\" (receiving anal sex) is about 1/72. Thus, for every 72 exposures, the recipient would contract HIV one time. This assumes that condoms are not used, and that the transmitter has an untreated HIV infection, which presumably has a high viral load. Transmission risk goes down by orders of magnitude for other forms of sex, until we get to receiving blowjobs, where the risk is literally nil. There are zero recorded cases of HIV caused by receiving a blowjob. In other words, HIV is actually kind of hard to get. You have to be very active, and not using protection, in order to get it. Or just be very, very unlucky. And that's with respect to untreated cases, which likely have high viral loads. This suggests to me that, for practical purposes, undetectable levels are impossible to transmit. Or as the Prep marketing executives would say, \"U means U\" - undetectable means untransmittable. Whether or not you're comfortable having sex with someone who is HIV+ but claims to have an undetectable viral load is a separate question entirely. reply jsperx 14 hours agorootparentI was ready to quibble with whether a primary care doctor would have the most reliable statistics on this topic but I found this source, with linked study, that implies (s)he is dead on: https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposur... (Also estimates chances for other risk profiles, including 0% for undetectable.) Seems like you’ve got a good doc there reply spencerchubb 17 hours agorootparentprev> Whether or not you're comfortable having sex with someone who is HIV+ but claims to have an undetectable viral load is a separate question entirely. If someone has HIV, they would have to be extremely suicidal to forego taking the medication that would make them undetectable. reply tidenly 16 hours agorootparentSorry to rant a little, but as someone who grew up with HIV in the family, this odd pressure against people who might be hesitant to sleep with someone U=U always feels uncomfortable and manipulative to me. I see it a lot around the internet. The way I was raised, I'm the only person I trust with my sexual health. I would never trust someones word they're tested recently and have unprotected sex with them. I wouldn't trust someone saying they're on PrEP and have unprotected sex with them either. I can only trust myself. U=U is exactly the same situation. In a zero trust mindset like that, someone telling me they're U=U only tells me they have HIV. I have HIV+ friends who struggle to take their meds at the right time every day, or forget. And I also know people who have lied about when they last took their STI screening to hookups. I'm also sure a bunch of people would get angry if you asked a U=U person to show you their latest CD4 count or viral load proof too - so what am I to do, just trust that, unlike everyone else, U=U people are perfectly honest, and never screw up taking their meds? The response to this is often \"anyone COULD have HIV, U=U people are actually safer because they have it locked down\", but again to me this is about as trustworthy as \"anyone COULD have HIV, but people on PrEP have it locked down\". It all relies on the trust the other person is on top of their shit. reply bleakenthusiasm 15 hours agorootparentI read this entire thread under the assumption that we are talking about long term partners here. Completely disregarding HIV, there are enough other STIs that say unprotected sex is a bad idea, so if we are talking about hookups, the person can tell me whatever they want, condom is mandatory. Of course long term relationships don't magically shield you against STI, but I'd hope there is enough trust to share test results of any kind that are relevant to this matter if you are having the discussion about going fluid bond. And you probably know the person well enough to know if they are reliable with taking their meds on time. reply lelanthran 9 hours agorootparentprev> this odd pressure against people who might be hesitant to sleep with someone U=U always feels uncomfortable and manipulative to me. That's because you're a probably a normal and well-adjusted person with no chips on their shoulder. > I see it a lot around the internet. If you think the population's attitudes are what is visible to you on the internet, you'd be wrong 100% of the time. Turns out, shaming people into silence on the internet does not change their minds about anything. reply perlgeek 12 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, consistent self-care isn't easy for many people struggling with mental health issues. Since you don't immediately feel worse after not taking your pill once, it's very easy to slip up if you aren't the most organized / functioning person. reply nerdjon 16 hours agorootparentprevIt’s interesting. I never really thought to ask about the chances with anal given that going on prep wasn’t really even a question. I knew it wasn’t one exposure and you would get it, but I honestly kinda figured the chances were higher than that. Regarding oral, I was under the impression that the important caveat there was assuming you had no major sores in your mouth (like, maybe don’t do it after getting dental surgery).

    "originBody": "Enabling & Support Double trouble: Gaia hit by micrometeoroid and solar storm 17/07/2024 15250 views 110 likes ESA / Enabling & Support / Operations Launched in December 2013, ESA’s Gaia spacecraft is on a mission to map the locations and motions of more than a billion stars in the Milky Way with extreme precision. But it’s not easy being a satellite: space is a dangerous place. In recent months, hyper-velocity space dust and the strongest solar storm in 20 years have threatened Gaia’s ability to carry out the precise measurements for which it is famous. Space rocks infographic: things that go bump in the night In April, a tiny particle smaller than a grain of sand struck Gaia at high speed. Known as a micrometeoroid, millions of these particles burn up in Earth’s atmosphere every day. But Gaia is located 1.5 million km from Earth at the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point (L2). Out here, far from our planet’s protective atmosphere, Gaia is often struck by particles like this. Impacts are expected, and the spacecraft was designed to withstand them. This object, however, struck Gaia at a very high speed and at just the wrong angle, damaging the spacecraft’s protective cover. The impact created a little gap that allowed stray sunlight – around one billionth of the intensity of direct sunlight felt on Earth – to occasionally disrupt Gaia’s very sensitive sensors. Gaia’s engineers were in the middle of dealing with this issue when they were faced with another problem. The spacecraft’s ‘billion-pixel camera’ relies on a series of 106 charge coupled devices (CCDs) – sensors that convert light into electrical signals. In May, the electronics controlling one of these CCDs failed – Gaia’s first CCD issue in more than 10 years in space. Each sensor has a different role, and the affected sensor was vital for Gaia’s ability to confirm the detection of stars. Without this sensor to validate its observations, Gaia began to register thousands of false detections. Gaia's 10th anniversary Aurora near Frankfurt, Germany, May 2024 The root cause for the electronics failure is not entirely clear. Gaia was designed to spend up to six years in space but has now survived almost twice as long under harsh conditions. Around the time of failure, Gaia was hit by the same violent burst of energetic particles from the Sun that triggered spectacular auroral lightshows around the world. The spacecraft was built to withstand radiation, but during the current period of high solar activity, it is being pushed to its limits. It is possible that the storm was the final straw for this piece of the spacecraft’s aging hardware. The Gaia teams at ESA’s ESOC operations centre, ESTEC technology centre and ESAC astronomy centre, together with experts from the spacecraft’s manufacturer, Airbus Defence and Space, and the payload experts of the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium, have worked together closely over the past few months to investigate, analyse and, ultimately, solve these problems. Gaia downlinks data to Earth via the deep space communication antennas in ESA's Estrack network “Gaia typically sends over 25 gigabytes of data to Earth every day, but this amount would be much, much higher if the spacecraft’s onboard software didn’t eliminate false star detections first.\" \"Both recent incidents disrupted this process. As a result, the spacecraft began generating a huge number of false detections that overwhelmed our systems,” explains Edmund Serpell, Gaia spacecraft operations engineer at ESOC. “We cannot physically repair the spacecraft from 1.5 million km away. However, by carefully modifying the threshold at which Gaia’s software identifies a faint point of light as a star, we have been able to dramatically reduce the number of false detections generated by both the straylight and CCD issues.” Thanks to the hard work and efficient collaboration of all the teams involved, Gaia was recently returned to routine operations. In fact, the engineers took the opportunity of this unscheduled disturbance to refocus the optics of Gaia’s twin telescopes for the final time. As a result, Gaia is now producing some of the best quality data that it ever has. Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!",

Just recently we had the news about Voyager 1 needing a remote updated to avoid some corrupted memory region, and I believe Hubble runs with only one gyroscope now, because the other ones either died or were slowly dying (while still far exceeding the original mission duration). I can imagine the satisfaction the software engineers feel if they can eek out a few more years of mission life out of a piece of expensive hardware that too far out to service directly. reply kelnos 10 hours agoparent> Hubble runs with only one gyroscope now, because the other ones either died or were slowly dying IIRC there are six total gyros on Hubble. Some of them have failed. Earlier this year, one of the three remaining failed as well, so they're down to two. They've dropped to a one-gyro mode now so they won't wear out both at the same time. Once the one they're using fails, they'll switch to the last one. The two remaining gyros are of a set of \"better\" gyros that were installed on a servicing mission 15 years ago or so. They could repair it (as well as give the satellite a much-needed orbit re-boost), but for now they've passed on doing so, presumably for budgetary reasons. Regardless, completely agree that it's incredible that these spacecraft often outlive their mission plan, sometimes drastically so. Hubble was projected to have 15 useful years (1990-2005), but it's still kicking (though not without the cost of past repair and upgrade missions), and should hopefully last well into the next decade. Longer, presumably, if it becomes compelling enough to spend the money to further service it. reply adolph 5 hours agorootparent> They could repair it (as well as give the satellite a much-needed orbit re-boost), but for now they've passed on doing so, presumably for budgetary reasons. It isn't clear anyone could \"repair it.\" Part of NASA's reticence has to do with Hubble's sensitivity and that any docking would be completely new since the Space Shuttle was the only vehicle to service Hubble. Additionally at least some see good science continuing '\"There's a greater than 70% probability of operating at least one gyro through 2035,\" Crouse said.' [0] A more conspiratorial part of me says there are imaging secrets the makers prefer to keep. On the other hand, there is the viewpoint that '\"Up until now, there's only been, you know, one group that would ever touch Hubble. And I think that they have an opinion of whether — of who should or shouldn't be allowed to touch it,\" Isaacman said. \"I think a lot would say, 'I'd rather it burn up' than, you know, go down a slippery slope of, you know, the space community growing. So I think that's a factor now, unfortunately.\"' [1] Personally, I see sunk cost fallacy as being a strong force in humanity. Additionally, the back and forth that may delay is resistance that will make Isaacman's solution better and certainly won't deter him. 0. https://www.space.com/jared-isaacman-hubble-space-telescope-... 1. https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1250250249/spacex-repair-hubb... reply rbanffy 3 hours agorootparentIt is possible to repair it and we know that because it was repaired many times before. It’d need at least some brand new hardware though. Until reusables make it cheap to launch a replacement (and so cheap the replacement doesn’t need to be built as carefully and expensively) it’s preferable to repair it. Or not, as ground-based observatories have evolved considerably since the Hubble was launched. reply mbonnet 1 hour agoparentprevExpected mission lifetime is often a function of \"if thing X, Y, Z goes wrong\". As you get past X, Y, and Z, mission lifetime will grow significantly. For example, for the James Webb telescope, its expected lifetime was limited by expected precision of orbit insertion by the Ariane 5 that launched it. Ariane 5 performed perfectly, so the resulting precision means the lifetime of the telescope is extended. reply dotancohen 25 minutes agorootparentIsn't JWST limited by the chilling hydrogen onboard? reply eb0la 11 hours agoparentprevProbably the key is to assume worst case scenario will always apply. After all space is an hostile enviroment you cannot control, and you need to have the device working for at least the whole mission lifetime. reply its_ethan 3 hours agorootparentAnother factor is that when NASA says the expected mission life is like 30 days or whatever, it doesn't mean they are designing to just meet that 30 day target. I can only speak to mechanical design, but the margins that NASA uses are huge, at least compared to consumer tech (I've worked in both). The 30 days is more like what they are \"liable\" for achieving per their directive.

More informed people will give you more details, but this kind of AV software often has privileged access to the OS, so it can scan your files.

This is misleading. If you run a python or VBA script on startup with elevated permissions to e.g. setup a driver (with a bug) or do hardware configurations (in a way which doesn't work) then it will as much blue screen as a sys file. The issue is not that it's a `.sys` file, but that a high privilege administrative task run at startup fails so hard that it blue screens. (In windows the sys file extension is basically just a marker that the file is part of the \"system\" without being clear what it is, it can be anything from a data blob,over a data base, over python/VBA files to a device driver or a blob combining multiple of such things.

If I look at the C-00000291-00000000-00000032.sys version that Crowdstrike LFO serves me, I get something that looks superficially reasonable (not random garbage or full of zeroes). I would share it, but my understanding is that channel files specifically can have different contents for different customers (as opposed to other files like their Linux kernel drivers, which is definitely the same giant .xz blob for everyone). So I'd rather not upload something that's potentially tied to a specific customer/company without asking for permission But if you have a valid customer ID from Crowdstrike, I'm happy to point you the little tool I use. You can request old versions of channel files from LFO and look at the diff as much as you like.

This makes your Windows machine go blue screen and stop working as it starts up. If you manage to remove it by various methods, it doesn't run and you're fine. More informed people will give you more details, but this kind of AV software often has privileged access to the OS, so it can scan your files. The same privileged access also means it can really mess things up if it's not well tested. By contrast your ordinary python or VBA script should not be able to blue screen your machine, especially not during startup. reply dathinab 6 hours agoparent> By contrast your ordinary python or VBA script should not be able to blue screen your machine, especially not during startup. This is misleading. If you run a python or VBA script on startup with elevated permissions to e.g. setup a driver (with a bug) or do hardware configurations (in a way which doesn't work) then it will as much blue screen as a sys file. The issue is not that it's a `.sys` file, but that a high privilege administrative task run at startup fails so hard that it blue screens. (In windows the sys file extension is basically just a marker that the file is part of the \"system\" without being clear what it is, it can be anything from a data blob,over a data base, over python/VBA files to a device driver or a blob combining multiple of such things.

NASA’s Curiosity Rover Discovers a Surprise in a Martian Rock Jet Propulsion Laboratory https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/ July 18, 2024 NASA’s Curiosity captured this close-up image of a rock nicknamed “Snow Lake” on June 8, 2024, the 4,209th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. Nine days earlier, the rover had crushed a similar-looking rock and revealed crystalline textures — and elemental sulfur — inside. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS These yellow crystals were revealed after NASA’s Curiosity happened to drive over a rock and crack it open on May 30. Using an instrument on the rover’s arm, scientists later determined these crystals are elemental sulfur — and it’s the first time this kind of sulfur has been found on the Red Planet.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Among several recent findings, the rover has found rocks made of pure sulfur — a first on the Red Planet. Scientists were stunned on May 30 when a rock that NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover drove over cracked open to reveal something never seen before on the Red Planet: yellow sulfur crystals. Since October 2023, the rover has been exploring a region of Mars rich with sulfates, a kind of salt that contains sulfur and forms as water evaporates. But where past detections have been of sulfur-based minerals — in other words, a mix of sulfur and other materials — the rock Curiosity recently cracked open is made of elemental, or pure, sulfur. It isn’t clear what relationship, if any, the elemental sulfur has to other sulfur-based minerals in the area. While people associate sulfur with the odor from rotten eggs (the result of hydrogen sulfide gas), elemental sulfur is odorless. It forms in only a narrow range of conditions that scientists haven’t associated with the history of this location. And Curiosity found a lot of it — an entire field of bright rocks that look similar to the one the rover crushed. Pan around this 360-degree video to explore Gediz Vallis channel, the location where NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover discovered sulfur crystals and drilled its 41st rock sample. The images that make up this mosaic were captured by the rover’s MastCam in June. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS “Finding a field of stones made of pure sulfur is like finding an oasis in the desert,” said Curiosity’s project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “It shouldn’t be there, so now we have to explain it. Discovering strange and unexpected things is what makes planetary exploration so exciting.” It’s one of several discoveries Curiosity has made while off-roading within Gediz Vallis channel, a groove that winds down part of the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) Mount Sharp, the base of which the rover has been ascending since 2014. Each layer of the mountain represents a different period of Martian history. Curiosity’s mission is to study where and when the planet’s ancient terrain could have provided the nutrients needed for microbial life, if any ever formed on Mars. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover captured this view of Gediz Vallis channel on March 31. This area was likely formed by large floods of water and debris that piled jumbles of rocks into mounds within the channel. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Floods and Avalanches Spotted from space years before Curiosity’s launch, Gediz Vallis channel is one of the primary reasons the science team wanted to visit this part of Mars. Scientists think that the channel was carved by flows of liquid water and debris that left a ridge of boulders and sediment extending 2 miles down the mountainside below the channel. The goal has been to develop a better understanding of how this landscape changed billions of years ago, and while recent clues have helped, there’s still much to learn from the dramatic landscape. Since Curiosity’s arrival at the channel earlier this year, scientists have studied whether ancient floodwaters or landslides built up the large mounds of debris that rise up from the channel’s floor here. The latest clues from Curiosity suggest both played a role: some piles were likely left by violent flows of water and debris, while others appear to be the result of more local landslides. While exploring Gediz Vallis channel in May, NASA’s Curiosity captured this image of rocks that show a pale color near their edges. These rings, also called halos, resemble markings seen on Earth when groundwater leaks into rocks along fractures, causing chemical reactions that change the color. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Those conclusions are based on rocks found in the debris mounds: Whereas stones carried by water flows become rounded like river rocks, some of the debris mounds are riddled with more angular rocks that may have been deposited by dry avalanches. Finally, water soaked into all the material that settled here. Chemical reactions caused by the water bleached white “halo” shapes into some of the rocks. Erosion from wind and sand has revealed these halo shapes over time. We’ve Got Some Space for You SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWSLETTER “This was not a quiet period on Mars,” said Becky Williams, a scientist with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and the deputy principal investigator of Curiosity’s Mast Camera, or Mastcam. “There was an exciting amount of activity here. We’re looking at multiple flows down the channel, including energetic floods and boulder-rich flows.” A Hole in 41 All this evidence of water continues to tell a more complex story than the team’s early expectations, and they’ve been eager to take a rock sample from the channel in order to learn more. On June 18, they got their chance. While the sulfur rocks were too small and brittle to be sampled with the drill, a large rock nicknamed “Mammoth Lakes” was spotted nearby. Rover engineers had to search for a part of the rock that would allow safe drilling and find a parking spot on the loose, sloping surface. After Curiosity bored its 41st hole using the powerful drill at the end of the rover’s 7-foot (2-meter) robotic arm, the six-wheeled scientist trickled the powderized rock into instruments inside its belly for further analysis so that scientists can determine what materials the rock is made of. Curiosity has since driven away from Mammoth Lakes and is now off to see what other surprises are waiting to be discovered within the channel.

Should we now hate the law instead of those people? reply batch12 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's only a game if people play. Disliking both works fine. reply kelipso 2 hours agorootparentLol okay but if you don't play the game, you lose. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentYou dont have to win every game. I'm fine not winning a Darwin award. reply micromacrofoot 2 hours agorootparentNASA is almost constantly struggling for budget, they need every eyeball they can get reply kjkjadksj 3 minutes agorootparentThey don't get budget by clickbait. How do I even as a registered voter have anything to do with NASA at all? I don't vote on their budget. I've never been offered to vote on a funding package for them. I chose from maybe two candidates as my representative on various levels of government, and am beholden to whatever platform they come up with. s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentprevShallow clickbait makes me less inclined to support the institution, not more. At a minimum, there are tradeoffs involved. reply micromacrofoot 43 minutes agorootparentRight and they need to get the general public interested in this stuff, not nerds on the nerdsite reply s1artibartfast 3 minutes agorootparentI think clickbait gets clicks, but doesn't build favorable sentiment or interest. I think this is true for the general public as well. To this end it might make sense for a company/website paid based on click through engagement, but you will notice that most of those institutions are generally despised by the public. I don't think being annoyed by clickbait is unique to nerds or such a sophisticated concept that the General Public can't comprehend it Tao3300 2 hours agoparentprevThat doesn't sound unique or interesting. Sulfur? So what. Not clicking. Surprise? Well, I was already pretty sure if it was water or life they'd have said so, but now I'm intrigued. I clicked and now I know why the find is actually pretty interesting after all. reply its_ethan 4 hours agoparentprevVery, very few people are going to click on the headline you've suggested, and engagement with the public is pretty important for NASA. \"Martian surprise\" is something that will get people interested, if only to click the link to see the picture of sulfur crystals and then leave the page 5 seconds later. Other news sites will also run with that headline, spreading the engagement far more than just a NASA article. Getting public engagement is a part of how they defend (and increase) their budget, so it makes sense that they would be more likely to use click-baity headlines. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ reply II2II 3 hours agorootparentThey need the right type of public engagement. That hypothetical person who sees the picture of sulphur crystals then leaves 5 seconds later is unlikely to support NASA. If they have enough negative interactions, I would suggest that it would achieve the opposite. There is also a difference between a clickbait headline and a headline that genuinely engages someone. Something like \"Unexpected discovery of sulphur crystals provides hints about Martian past\" provides vastly more useful information and will probably be more appealing to people who have at least some interest in science. (Or at least rock collecting!) At least in my case, I decided to read the comments here before even considering a look at the article. Not only did the idea of a \"surprise\" leave me thoroughly disinterested, but I have been bitten by NASA's hyperbole often enough to be hesitant about pursuing a clickbait link. Which is sad, because planetary science is interesting and the article itself wasn't that bad for something directed towards a general audience. reply eszed 37 minutes agorootparentDo most people consider click-bait headlines to be a negative interaction? Arguably they should, but I don't think it's the case. reply dotancohen 18 minutes agorootparentprevEven more likely, the user won't click to the article. But two days later she'll mention to either me or another space nut like me \"Hey, what was that surprise that NASA found on Mars?\". And the conversation that sparks will be engaging and interesting for her. reply solardev 4 hours agorootparentprevGosh, I really hope our premier scientific entities don't have to rely on page visits (ignoring bounce rate) to measure their impact or get funding :/ reply Kye 3 hours agorootparentThey're a scientific organization that lives or dies on the whims of people who have to win elections. Outreach is survival, and reach is essential to that. reply kjkjadksj 1 minute agorootparentThats exactly why clickbait makes no sense. Who is it targeting? The lay person? They have no say in NASA's budget. If NASA wants funding they have to look at who holds the reigns in congress and give them pork. Thats it. That's their mechanism. When they were extremely well funded around apollo it was because they had pork a la advancing ICBM and surveillance satellite technology. Not because they got billy to tune in between episodes of will rogers. krapp 2 hours agorootparentprevThey live and die on the whims of the CIA and military industrial complex. They are a platform for delivering spy satellites that's allowed to do a bit of science as a treat. The public, for the most part, stopped caring about NASA after the US stopped going to the moon. Most of the rest believe NASA is hiding aliens or controlling the weather or some such nonsense. reply its_ethan 1 hour agorootparentFrom The Planetary Society: \"None of NASA's budget is used for national defense or intelligence gathering programs; it is a civilian agency responsible for the peaceful exploration of space\" Do you have evidence to the contrary you could share? https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasa-budget#:~:text=N.... reply Kye 2 hours agorootparentprevI thought SpaceX took over that role. reply krapp 2 hours agorootparentNot entirely, I don't think. reply its_ethan 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm not saying it's a good thing, just that it's a reality NASA has to deal with. so yea... :/ reply Sharlin 2 hours agorootparentprevI mean, number of citations is only a slightly better way to measure impact than number of page visits. reply jkestner 2 hours agorootparentprevI just visited the Johnson Space Center, and boy, was there a lot of PR for SLS and Mars on exhibit. I shouldn't have felt weird about it given the artists' depictions of planetary probes and spacecraft concepts I grew up with, but I've read too much about the reality of the program to get into a Mars expedition in a decade. Meanwhile the miracle that was the asteroid hunter probe got an easily-overlooked station with an actual sample it brought back from Bennu in an inadequate magnifying display case. reply rambojohnson 2 hours agoparentprevwhen the majority of the population in America suffers from brain rot, it behooves Nasa to engage the public with clickbait. it's not like Nasa gets the best funding in the world from our government compared to military and all our other genocidal ventures. reply kjkjadksj 3 minutes agorootparentThey don't get their funding from writing articles. They get it by marrying scientific goals with defense goals. reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentprevThe prevalence of clickbait contributes to the brain rot. reply 1970-01-01 4 hours agoprevI have a hunch this valley is hiding many more geological secrets. If you look at the map, Curiosity is finally arriving at the more interesting bits of Mt. Sharp. https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/location-map/ reply dotancohen 13 minutes agoparentHad it already been 12 years? The last time that I looked at a map of Curiosity's location it was somewhere around Darwin and I suppose Cooperstown hadn't been named yet. And the map was certainly not interactive. reply fusslo 3 hours agoparentprevso cool. First time I've seen that map It struck me that I have no idea how curiosity is instructed to move I suspect someone can't be sitting in front of a computer with a joystick, moving a foot, waiting for curiosity to move a foot, then move another foot... My next thought is nasa creates a route based on the map and then provides route data to curiosity. But there's no GPS (again, I assume). So is it all dead-reckoning? NASA somehow calculates 'move 100 ft forward, turn left 80 degrees, move 10 ft forward\", etc? (I am also assuming NASA uses metric) OR does curiosity make its own decisions somehow? I gotta go google some stuff now reply floxy 50 minutes agoparentprevThat's a pretty cool map.

In fact, researchers describe how ongoing deoxygenation presents a major threat to the stability of the planet as a whole.Share:FacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedINEmailFULL STORY Oxygen is a fundamental requirement of life, and the loss of oxygen in water, referred to as aquatic deoxygenation, is a threat to life at all levels. In fact, in research recently published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Associate Professor Kevin Rose, Ph.D. and his collaborators describe how ongoing deoxygenation presents a major threat to the stability of the planet as a whole.Previous research has identified a suite of global scale processes, referred to as Planetary Boundaries, that regulate the overall habitability and stability of the planet. These processes include things such as climate change, land use change, and biodiversity loss. It has been argued that if critical thresholds in these processes are passed, then major ecological, economic, and social challenges are likely to result. Importantly, Rose and collaborators argue that aquatic deoxygenation both responds to, and regulates, other Planetary Boundary processes. \"It's important that aquatic deoxygenation be added to the list of Planetary Boundaries,\" said Rose. \"This will help support and focus global monitoring, research, and policy efforts to help our aquatic ecosystems and, in turn, society at large.\" Across all aquatic ecosystems, from streams and rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ponds to estuaries, coasts, and the open ocean, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations have rapidly and substantially declined in recent decades. Lakes and reservoirs have experienced oxygen losses of 5.5% and 18.6% respectively since 1980. The oceans have experienced oxygen losses of around 2% since 1960 and, although that number is smaller, it represents a more geographically and volumetrically extensive mass. Marine ecosystems have also experienced substantial variability in oxygen depletion. For example, the midwaters off of Central California have lost 40% of their oxygen in the last few decades. The volumes of aquatic ecosystems affected by oxygen depletion have increased dramatically across all types. \"Aquatic deoxygenation is closely linked to changes in climate and land use,\" said Rose. \"It is caused by decreases in the solubility of oxygen in water resulting from increasing temperatures, reduced deep-water ventilation due to stronger and longer stratification, and increases in oxygen-consuming respiration linked to both elevated temperature and enhanced inputs of nutrients and organic matter. Global warming and pollutants are disrupting biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems and it is adversely affecting both freshwater and marine organisms.\" Species experience physiological effects and entire food-webs can be transformed when deoxygenation occurs. Individual organisms often experience reduced sensory abilities, growth, body size, and reproduction. Low oxygen can also lead to widespread death and ecological impairment. Aquatic habitats with low oxygen levels are commonly referred to as \"dead zones\" because of their loss of life, which threatens ecosystem services like fishing, aquaculture, tourism, and cultural practices. Deoxygenation can also induce aquatic ecosystems to transition to alternative and undesirable states, characterized by harmful algal blooms and widespread anoxia, or lack of oxygen. \"We are approaching critical thresholds of aquatic deoxygenation that will ultimately affect several other Planetary Boundaries,\" said Rose, \"DO regulates the role of marine and freshwater in modulating Earth's climate. Improving DO concentrations depends on addressing the root causes, including climate warming and runoff from developed landscapes. Failure to address aquatic deoxygenation will, ultimately, not only affect ecosystems but also economic activity, and society at a global level.\" \"Aquatic deoxygenation trends represent a clear warning and call to action that should inspire changes to slow or even mitigate this Planetary Boundary,\" said Curt Breneman, Ph.D., Dean of Rensselaer's School of Science. \"Professor Rose's work will pave the way for further research and open the door to new regulatory actions.\" RELATED TOPICSPlants & AnimalsEcology Research Marine Biology Nature Sea LifeEarth & ClimateEcology Ecosystems Biodiversity Water RELATED TERMSDead zone (ecology) Ozone Water pollution Carbon dioxide Phosphate Earth's atmosphere Oxygen H5N1 Story Source: Materials provided by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Is this something that cyclical? The article is long on effect and very short on causes. \"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient runoff and organic carbon inputs (for example, raw sewage loading) would slow or potentially reverse deoxygenation,\" they write. And what exactly is \"raw sewage loading\" they talk about as a way to reverse this? I did some quick googling and couldn't find anything about what exactly it is. reply LeifCarrotson 2 hours agorootparentReducing carbon inputs would slow or reverse this. Increasing sewage runoff would make the problem worse. Raw sewage contamination is a huge problem: https://environmentamerica.org/center/resources/safe-for-swi... Don't go swimming too soon after it rains if you want to be safe from E. coli. Overdevelopment, underfunded utilities, and factory farms put runoff at a level that's barely tolerable when it's dry, and when there's excess surface water, they overflow in unsanitary ways that result in nutrient blooms and oxygen depletion. reply dgacmu 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's literally what it sounds like: dumping untreated sewage into waterways and oceans.

Schneider quotes University of Wisconsin climatologist Reid Bryson as saying that 1930-1960 \"was the most abnormal period in a thousand years - abnormally mild\". In fact conditions of steady warm weather in the northern hemisphere during that time favoured bumper harvests in the United States, the Soviet Union and the wheat belt of southern India and Pakistan. In 1974 Schneider and Bryson tried to explain to a White House policy-making group why conditions are likely to worsen. https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/18/archives/the-genesis-stra...

What a bunch of shit. reply shicholas 3 hours agopreveating less meat seems like the biggest thing individuals can do here. Animal waste/fertilizer runoff/agricultural waste seems like the biggest contributor. any other suggestions? reply _heimdall 2 hours agoparentI'd caveat this by saying eating less industrially raised and processed meat would help. The same goes for industrial produce though, they cause a ton of damage that few people ever see or think about. If we want realistic solutions, they'll all be incremental like using less plastic or Turing lights off when you aren't home. If we want recommendations that would actually help, we would need to completely reorganize societies and our daily lives. We don't need cars, air travel, grocery stores, or even air conditioning to survive. Those are all modern inventions on the order of decades old. People aren't going to do that willingly though, including me. I live a very different, and more simple, life than the average American but the idea of throwing out so many things that we have today only because we've enslaved natural fuel sources is scary as hell. reply mihaic 2 hours agoparentprevWhatever the solutions are, let's not push burden on the individual.

No till, no spray, cover crops. Managed grazing of ruminants and poultry on the same land that crops are grown on to build top soil and serve as pest control. reply _heimdall 2 hours agorootparentRegenerative ag is a ton of work, and at least in my anecdotal experience I didn't see any meaningful gains from it. We rotated our cows once or twice a day, carefully tracking how much space they got each day based on the animals' weight and quality of forage. The animals got by okay, but honestly they seemed to act more like prisoners than cows. It shows even when you watch some of the biggest names in regenerative move their animals - the animals dive past the line into the space. Those animals are hungry and stressed by being so densely kept that they feel they need to eat before it's all gone. Today we keep our cows in what anyone else would consider a much too low stocking density. We move them occasionally between 3 different pastures, on the order of weeks or months between each move. The animals seem less stressed, they're definitely happier, and they've created familial bonds and hierarchy that wasn't obvious when we kept them in closer quarters with frequent moves. reply colechristensen 3 hours agoprevAlternate, positive headline \"Earth's water sinking more carbon, oxygen loss shows\". CO2 is a potent fertilizer and is going to cause a lot of \"blooms\" and general more life which is going to affect oxygen levels. Loss of oxygen is a dampening effect on this. Every environmental article has to be about \"danger\" instead of just stating facts about what is happening now. reply jacobolus 3 hours agoparentIt seems fairly straightforward to claim that significantly changing water chemistry is very bad, or at least very risky, for aquatic ecosystems many of whose species are very sensitive to water chemistry. The \"positive\" here is supposed to be that widespread destruction of land ecosystems might be even more severe if not for the oceans also taking some of the damage? (I doubt that is true in the long run. Many global processes are dependent on functioning living oceans.) reply Johnny555 2 hours agoparentprevKind of like how fertilizer runoff is a good thing since it causes algae blooms, and more life is good right? Except that it disrupts existing ecosystems and can cause vast oxygen-free dead zones. reply colechristensen 2 hours agorootparentOne of the things we should be doing is intentionally fertilizing oceans, particularly the \"deserts\" where not much grows at all, as an intentional way to cause blooms and sink carbon. reply Johnny555 2 hours agorootparentYes, let's not stop doing the thing that we know is destroying our ecosystem, and instead, lets try a mass geoengineering effort when we are incapable of knowing what unintended side effects will happen when we do it on a large scale. reply quantified 3 hours agoprevIt's plausible but needs quantification. I doubt it's been truly overlooked. reply stainablesteel 2 hours agoprev [–] i can't read the article but this seems like a strange conclusion there should be more dissolved oxygen as water becomes warmer, i thought climate change was the big disaster we were supposed to be worried about? less dissolved oxygen would suggest the water is cooler reply HappySweeney 2 hours agoparentThis is incorrect. When dissolving a gas into a liquid, the colder the liquid is, the more gas can be dissolved. reply 0x138d5 2 hours agoparentprev>there should be more dissolved oxygen as water becomes warmer, Oxygen solubility in water is inversely correlated with temperature and salinity. reply MisterBastahrd 2 hours agoparentprevTell ya what, take two cans of coke.
