        "hn_content": "A keyboard system called Semaphore, which focuses on inputting words with physical gestures for each letter and punctuation, has received positive feedback from HN users. Future developments include making it into a customizable, full-body game controller. Semaphore has implications for product development, including for remote workers who want to combine physical exercise and programming. Discussion among users revolves around the possibility of combining Semaphore with stenography, musical notes, yoga exercises, and programming. Some comments point out the potential for increased efficiency through the addition of features like an autocomplete.A developer has created a game controller that uses Semaphore body signals as input. The YouTube video of the controller has garnered a lot of attention due to its humor, 80s workout-video style, and clever technology. The software, created using Google's MediaPipe and OpenCV, currently only recognizes a few simple positions, but the developer hopes that one day, users will be able to create custom motions to be recognized in-game. While Semaphore signaling dates back to the French Revolution, some users were only familiar with Semaphore programming.The \"save\" button is still generally represented by a floppy disk, and many common software terms like \"semaphore\" have non-computer origins; some users are surprised when they learn about them, but other computing concepts like \"register\" have more general, recognizable use cases. A few fun and interesting takes come into the conversation: such as the history of railway semaphore signal systems, flag semaphore signaling between ships, smoke signals as an original form of semaphore, and examples of modern alternatives to traditional typing systems. Despite this, not everyone is thrilled about the trend of reusing words that already have established meanings.The article showcases a unique keyboard configuration utilizing semaphore alphabet for typing. The creator uses various poses of hands and body to represent different letters and symbols. The project also incorporates OpenCV and machine learning to recognize the different hand signs more accurately. Comments suggest various potential use cases, including interactive gaming and programming macros. However, some do mention the limitations of such a keyboard for extended use or accessibility purposes.A hacker on GitHub shared a video demonstrating how he can program computers by moving his body in a specific way. The video went viral on social media with individuals sharing their opinions ranging from \"completely impractical\" to \"completely wonderful.\" Apart from this, some comments highlight the unusual device used for communication and ideas about using it for authentication and gaming purposes. In retrospect, such project ideas add joy, mischief, and wonder to the world of computing.",

Phind feeds in relevant websites and technical documentation to reduce hallucination and keep the answer up-to-date. GPT-4 delivers step-by-step instructions over 90% of the time while Phind's default mode does not. Phind aims to be the go-to source for many machine learning (ML) developers as it answers questions about recent ML libraries, papers, and technologies that ChatGPT simply cannot. Custom filters can be specified for low-quality content, and users are encouraged to give feedback.A solution for pathfinding constraints can be achieved by creating a graph from adjacent pairs in the grid, having edges connecting the pairs either if they are free or are separated by a wall. A*-algorithm can be used to find the shortest path. Various constraints like limiting the changes in direction or being eaten by the monster side can be added to this solution. It is noted that GPT-4 is bad at problem-solving. Google's search engine may have non-aligned incentives with its users, showing ads rather than giving correct answers, but with more AI improvements, these issues can be resolved.Phind, an AI-powered search engine, is making waves on Hacker News with users praising its ability to provide precise and detailed answers to their queries. Users report the AI even provides code to solve programming problems. However, there are concerns over the future of content producers as Phind's model pulls information from other sources, potentially costing them valuable clicks. The Phind team has acknowledged this issue and is exploring revenue-sharing models with content creators. A few users address the need for courtesy in human-like responses and the potential for an improvement in search's revenue model.Experts on Hacker News discuss their experiences trying out a new chat search engine, noting shortcomings such as outdated answers and lack of expertise in non-IT fields, but also praising the service for providing useful supplementary information in some cases; one user even suggests they would pay for the service over other language models. Criticisms of the search engine include examples of inadequate or problematic responses, such as copy-pasting code without proper attribution or licensing information, and the difficulty of providing correct answers that work with specific versions of software or libraries.Phind.com combines the best parts of ChatGPT and Google search, and provides unambiguously clear information with links to relevant blog posts. Phind has plans to monetize with a 'Pro' tier and plans to build out its models with stricter privacy guarantees. Currently, the platform uses GPT-4 API calls, making it potentially expensive. Enterprise subscriptions are also welcomed. Although it runs well on Expert mode, asking for niche information may yield nonsensical answers. It references and points to real documentation/websites and is forced to provide correct results. Funding long-term is a concern but various monetization options exist.Phind, a search tool that feeds relevant websites to GPT-4 to generate better results, is gaining popularity on Hacker News. Users have reported that Phind's \"Expert\" mode improves its accuracy and usefulness, and it is more efficient than traditional search engines. However, some users note that the tool occasionally hallucinates irrelevant or incorrect results, and there are questions about pricing and its ability to pull documentation for lesser-known libraries. Despite some limitations, experts in the field believe that Phind is a valuable tool for developers using GPT-4 or similar models.Phind, a search engine created by experts, has used a unique method to create embeddings of popular tech developer docs pages. It uses a clever prompt and leverages the knowledge of the embeddings for every search query to give developers a better, more relevant answer to their coding questions. Expending custom web context, the AI answers have been thoroughly researched by the team, enabling Phind to offer users the best, most reliable service on the market that even trumps Google and ChatGPT.Phind, a new AI tool powered by GPT-3, helps refine prompts and queries by providing answers to specific questions. The tool has been criticized for providing inaccurate and irrelevant answers, but recent upgrades to mitigate this problem include an Expert mode. One HN user experienced issues with the generated Go code and received irrelevant output sometimes. Despite some criticisms and questions about their business model, Phind is a free tool with accounts and a pro version on the roadmap.Users comment on OpenAI's accessibility, accuracy, and functionality, with some expressing concerns regarding its monetization strategy; an HN user points out an error in OpenAI's training set for bigquery; others praise the 'Expert mode' feature and inquire about the model used; one user questions the AI hype and its gimmick-like qualities; and OpenAI responds to feedback on the presentation of its generated text, citing compromise due to scaling for quality.",

        "hn_content": "An HN user discusses the potentially dangerous consequences of building a digital copy of an individual that answers questions just as they would. The user cites the ease of companies accessing and using private data to create these models but notes that legally, companies cannot pry into private data without consent. Another HN user argues that using an LLM (large language models) to make hiring decisions is just a more abstracted version of manually reviewing data, and the existing laws and moral/social pressure still apply. However, another warns of potential ethical issues, such as collecting private data and anonymizing it for the purpose of building a model. Companies may use these models for automated hiring processes, leading to concerns about privacy and data usage.Experts have raised concerns about the potential risks of using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze personal data. Tech companies' use of personal data is a contentious issue, with concerns that LLMs could be utilized for 'profitable' purposes. Critics have warned against the potential for \u00a0LLMs to\u00a0be used for nefarious purposes, including\u00a0by autocratic regimes to identify key opposition personnel. The legality of such practices and LLM's use have raised ethical questions regarding privacy, as well as the potential for firms to break the law to increase profits.\u00a0Users also discussed the possibility that LLMs could be used to skim people's emails for content, rather than hiring managers.Claims made in \"The Twitter Files\" have been challenged by several journalists, including Matt Taibbi, who was criticized for exaggerating key numbers. Elon Musk's enlistment of select journalists is being viewed as an attempt to put a spin on a \"nothingburger\" and push a narrative, contrary to his previous statements that journalists are known for pushing narratives. The discussion shifts to AI and LLMs, with concerns about their untested impact on privacy and their potential in producing inaccurate outputs. There is skepticism about current AI research and its ability to create truly intelligent systems, with experts expressing concerns about the gap between the hype surrounding the technology and the actual limitations of current AI models.A debate is ongoing about the definition of intelligence and whether it is more than data storage and retrieval. LLMs are seen as an important tool in the field of AI but some people are hyperskeptical while others may overstate their capabilities. Prompting does improve the performance of LLMs up to a point but they may still produce flawed responses, especially to subjective questions. LLMs are best at providing fluent, English language text; therefore, they can be expected to offload factual questions to databases or mathematical solvers, and other algorithms, which may perform better than LLMs at these tasks.A post on Hacker News discussing an MIT-developed language model (LLM) trained to output plausible phrases has attracted attention, with users discussing potential applications such as creating a digital copy of someone. The primary challenge with training LLMs is to target what it can do well, and not to expect it to be useful in every scenario, suggested contributors to the discussion. One user noted that the hallucinations created by LLMs are largely wrong to the same degree.The article discusses the use of chatbots mimicking human personalities and how it can be achieved through machine learning methods. Some comments suggest the idea seems questionable, and some discuss potential use cases, such as generating different voices or creating virtual assistants. There is also a debate on the concern of privacy and security, and some commenters mention the risk of authoritarian governments misusing such technologies. However, others argue that the benefits outweigh the negatives and that people should not worry too much about it.The article features a discussion related to the possibility of giant tech companies building artificial persons to replicate human communication. Despite skepticism about the effectiveness of using digital data as training sets, some HN users feel that Facebook would be best positioned to make such replicas given the volume of data the company stores. GDPR and other data privacy concerns were also raised during the debate. While some dismiss such concerns as hyperbole, others believe that building digital replicas of human beings is essentially a new form of feudalism powered by technology, and that we may be witness to the beginning of a century of human suffering punctuated by a mass extinction.The Tech Times discusses a sci-fi series and recommendations made by HN users. Although the conversation threads off-topic and touches on recreating loved ones as AI, with concerns raised around the ethics of said technology. Potential uses of AI include using the tech to create a model that can provide advice, training machine learning on oneself, and creating 3D renderings of loved ones using videos.Comments on a Hacker News thread discussing the potential uses, drawbacks, and implications of training large language models show concern about the impact AI-generated art, music, and conversations will have on human connection and shared experience, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on social isolation; some users suggest the growing influence of AI online will lead people back to direct human engagement. Several lighthearted and sarcastic comments on the thread point out the wide range of potential (and sometimes absurd) uses of trained models. There are also some questions about the technicalities of fine-tuning LLM models, for which users suggest using plain text files, rephrasing documents as question-answer pairs, and training on social media data.Online platforms are lowering the cost of radicalization by replacing human moderators with AI. This development could lead to disturbing societal ramifications and the breakdown of human-to-human bonds. Ownership of LLM dupe output after death remains unclear. In the future, people might be able to sell their chat history to companies building more advanced, realistic chatbots. Time dimension and AI's ability to leave someone on read are critical factors for increased realism when developing the technology. This online chat could be a light-hearted, fun alternative to the more serious LLM projects.Experts warn that existing text-completion tools could be dangerous in the hands of those with immense wealth and power, especially if capable of deploying human-like internet agents at their discretion. However, some users speculate that these tools offer a chance for personal reflection and discovery, such as training a bot on personal communication from years past. Others warn against the ethical implications of creating crude digital simulations of lost loved ones or a government training AI on information regarding a specific suspect for the purpose of obtaining a warrant. While the capabilities of these text-completion tools continue to develop, the potential applications and ethical considerations are cause for concern.The Tech Times reported on a post about a recent write-up on creating an AI-powered 'deceased loved one'. The article was littered with sarcastic comments and ethical concerns raised by the HN members. One hint of interest from the experts was that AI friends/companions could soon be more interesting and stimulating than any real person, raising concerns of addiction to this technology. However, a few HN members were quick to point out the severe negative societal impact of such technology in the wrong hands. Lastly, one member joked about creating their own private HN version where all their comments are upvoted.An unnamed company builds a product that allows people to program the perfect friend, leading to isolation from real human connections. Some believe this could be the form that the singularity takes. One user found the generated AI group chat funny, but only because they could share it with their real friends. Although the internet has more content than friends ever could, friends are still irreplaceable due to their investment in one's life. Companies may incorporate AI friends into their products. The idea of AI friends being more interesting than real people is questioned.",

        "hn_content": "NPR quit Twitter after being labeled as \"state-affiliated media\" due to the government funding it receives from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Some users on HN have pointed out that Twitter itself could get a label for receiving concessions from San Francisco on their headquarters, or for having significant government funding like Elon Musk's account or SpaceX or Telsa. Others have noted that Twitter is not a news organization and labels are meant for news publishers to declare potential bias, and that NPR has never been \"state-affiliated media.\" However, some comments have suggested that NPR should disclose its funding sources for transparency purposes.Twitter recently labeled NPR as government-funded media, after first tagging it as state-affiliated media. Given the indirect funding, some debate the label as unfair, but Twitter stands by its criteria of \"Financial Resource\" being important for categorization. NPR was created by an act of Congress and receives funding by the US government, but corporations and foundations still make up the majority of its funding. While Fox News and Washington Post also receive government funding, they don't meet the definition for state-affiliated. Whether Twitter's categorization criteria are agreed upon or not, other outlets set their own criteria as well.Elon Musk's Twitter account and other companies receiving significant government funding are being questioned for having a \"government-funded media\" label. One user highlights the government's easy loan terms, while others discuss the CIA's investment capital arm and Elon Musk's sensitivity to critical media. Some HN users question if the \"Free speech\" facade of Twitter is accurate, while others argue labels on media publishers are to make readers aware of the writers' motivations. There are also discussions about significant brands leaving Twitter, citing its lack of moderation and safe space.The labeling of certain English language news outlets on Elon Musk's Twitter as \"state-affiliated media\" has been inconsistent, with some state-owned media outlets not receiving the label. There is a debate about whether Elon Musk's Twitter, Tesla, or SpaceX should have the same label due to government funding. Twitter is a media company and distributes media, while its audience is primarily there for the content, not the technology. The primary readers of this post are concerned with how labeling is applied and the confusion within discourse over state-sponsored media.An HN user debates whether Twitter's technology is valuable to its customers and investors, and if it can be outsourced; a discussion ensues over what defines a \"tech company\" versus a \"media company,\" and whether social media companies fall under the latter; the labeling of news outlets as \"government-affiliated\" is viewed as less informative than other labels which highlight bias and editorializing.The funding of media organizations is a complicated matter, and relying solely on who funds them is not enough to determine their biases. NPR, while federally funded, remains editorially independent, as are other entities such as Twitter. The type of reporting and political skew of news media can be rated, although this doesn't capture everything, and incentives for slanted coverage should not be overlooked. While NPR does receive federal funding, member stations pay NPR, and much of NPR's funding comes from the public, which means that characterizing it as \"state-affiliated media\" is inaccurate.State or government media refers to media organizations that are either directly or indirectly owned/operated by the state, ranging from completely state controlled outlets to editorially independent public service media outlets. Twitter defines \"state-affiliated media\" as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct/indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution. NPR receives federal funding, but is considered editorially independent unlike most entities labeled \"state-affiliated media\". However, they have been accused of being left-leaning and not reporting on certain stories, such as the Hunter Biden laptop scandal.NPR's Managing Editor defended their decision to label the Hunter Biden laptop story a \"pure distraction\" and \"waste of time,\" with a user pointing out that the laptop saga was suspicious and NPR should have handled it differently if the laptop had belonged to President Trump's son. Users debated whether stories involving politicians' family members were fair game for journalists, with some saying it could expose corruption while others thought it was a distraction. Some comments pointed out that the laptop story's reliability was questionable and that NPR's decision was justified.NPR has received criticism after being labeled \"state-affiliated media\", which some say implies government control over its content. While NPR does receive some government funding, it maintains editorial independence. Some users argue that the use of such labels is a misleading tool for plausible deniability, and that it is important to look at each case individually. Comparing NPR to truly state-controlled media like those in China or North Korea is dishonest. NPR was established by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 to increase public education through media, and NPR affiliate stations service areas where there are no incentives for private stations.NPR's funding and editorial credibility have been under scrutiny, with some accusing them of state sponsorship and others defending their transparency. Musk's recent tweet labeling them as \"state-sponsored media\" has caused controversy, with some NPR listeners feeling their credibility has been unfairly tarnished. While government funding can create a conflict of interest with editorial independence, NPR estimates that only about 4% of their revenue comes from federal, state, and local governments. The debate highlights the challenge of media outlets maintaining independence while still securing the funding they need to operate. Overall, NPR remains a respected news source for many despite these arguments.Comments on an HN thread discuss the potential conflict of interest in NPR relying on government funding while expected to provide impartial media coverage. One user claims that no evidence of bias is necessary to establish that a conflict of interest exists. However, another user argues that if there is no bias, this is a non-issue. NPR claims that the loss of federal funding would undermine their ability to provide programming. The comments also touch on the topic of state-funded media, with some arguing that NPR and BBC differ from Russian and Chinese state media in terms of independence and fights for independence.The article discusses the implications and differences between state-funded media and state media, stating that the two terms are often used interchangeably. The comments reveal discussions on the funding and biases of media outlets such as NPR and Al Jazeera, with some arguing they are left-leaning while others view them as more fair and unbiased than other outlets. The conversation also highlights the voluntary nature of NPR's funding and its relationship with member stations, questioning the accuracy of labeling them as \"government-funded.\" Overall, the discussion brings attention to the complexities of media funding and bias.Elon Musk's companies, like SpaceX and Starlink, receive a significant amount of defense money, and some commenters suggest that other companies in his portfolio fall under this category as well. Some argue that NPR's ties to the government through corporate sponsorships and funding could impact their editorial independence. However, others point out that less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes from grants from CPB and federal agencies, and NPR has demonstrated editorial independence by publishing programming critical of the Trump administration. There are concerns about Twitter's involvement in suppression exercises around COVID, leading some to question if it should be labeled as State Affiliated Media.Twitter's new \"State-affiliated media\" label has raised questions about its application to non-state-funded news organizations such as NPR, with some arguing the label is useless in theory and malicious in practice when only applied to a tiny subset of government-funded companies; an HN user points out that government support is essential for most businesses, making the label meaningless. Many news outfits have attempted to argue that the amount of money they receive from governments is insignificant, however, investigations have suggested that NPR's government funding could be closer to 20-40%.",
        "hn_summary": "NPR faced criticism and ultimately quit Twitter after being labeled as \"state-affiliated media\" due to government funding, leading to a debate on the criteria for such labeling and whether it accurately characterizes NPR as a news organization with editorial independence.

Some advocate for specific use cases of generative AI, while others express concerns about its potential to automate middle-class jobs. Facebook's failed pivot towards the Metaverse is seen as a result of its data-focused business model, with generative AI suggested as an alternative pivot. While certain technologies like generative language models and smartphones have seen success in the past, the value of some emerging technologies may not be evident until they are used. Neutral, real-time networks with smart contracts are seen as a natural fit for agentic AI.Advancements in generative media have the potential to make virtual/augmented immersion more compelling, while doubts are raised about the accuracy of generative AI models. Meta Labs has sold over 20 million devices, but the success of the Apple headset is uncertain. Companies are looking to generative AI to help speed up the AR/VR technology market. The Metaverse is still lacking, and opinions are split on its potential. VR technology has potential beyond entertainment, particularly in the fitness industry, but affordable hardware is still a necessary factor for its implementation. The crypto industry is viewed as an affinity scam, but Bitcoin is still viewed differently by some.",

April 2023Download imageEarlier today, Hetzner, the German hosting and cloud provider launched four new Hetzner Cloud servers, the first ones at Hetzner to use innovative Arm technology. They come with up to 16 vCPUs based on Ampere\u00ae Altra\u00ae processors. \u201cAmpere\u2019s extremely efficient and powerful Arm-based cloud native processors have been impressing users since their release. They also provide an exciting alternative to AMD and Intel CPUs, which until now, were the two main options for Hetzner Cloud servers. With the new Arm64 Cloud instances, we can give our customers more options and flexibility, and at an amazing price-to-performance ratio,\u201d explained Markus Schade, Teamlead for Cloud Platform at Hetzner. Over a year ago, Hetzner announced a new partnership with Ampere, and introduced a dedicated server which is based on Arm64. \u201cWith the Hetzner CAX cloud servers built on the Ampere\u00ae Altra\u00ae Family of Cloud Native Processors, customers worldwide now get access to the most efficient cloud infrastructure available,\u201d said Jeff Wittich, Chief Product Officer at Ampere. \u201cCombining high performance, price effectiveness, and the most sustainable compute available today, Hetzner customers no longer need to compromise to get more for less when renting CAX Cloud Servers.\u201dHetzner\u2019s new \u201cCAX\u201d-line of cloud server plans come with up to 32 GB of ECC RAM and up to 320 GB of NVMe SSD-based storage. Thanks to their excellent performance, the cloud plans are ideal for web servers that receive lots of visitors, for servers used to run various apps, and for other demanding workloads. If users need to scale up later, it is easy to add more resources at any time to suit a growing use case, for example, by adding more SSD-based storage to their cloud server. All of Hetzner Cloud\u2019s operating systems images and 1-click apps support the extensive Arm ecosystem \u2014 customers can use them just as they would with any other Hetzner Cloud servers. The architecture of the new CAX-line will allow users to natively build Arm64-based applications and cloud containers.To administer their cloud server, clients have access to Hetzner\u2019s intuitive and user-friendly Cloud Console, which includes many impressive and useful features, such as the Load Balancer feature, which allows users to direct their traffic to pre-configured infrastructure, and the Networks feature, for building secure private networks. With Hetzner\u2019s programmer-friendly REST-API and CLI tool, customers can automate processes and integrate tools from third parties. And, of course, Hetzner provides extensive documentation and programming examples to make getting started even easier.The new server plans start at the unbeatable prices of just \u20ac 3.79 a month, which includes an IPv4 address, and there is no setup fee or minimum contract period. If users\u2019 servers only exist for part of the month, they will only pay for the hours when the servers existed. This hourly billing option gives customers even more flexibility and will help keep costs low.",

Some comments argue for the benefits of running microservices on a single machine with powerful hardware, while others highlight the advantages of microservices for setting hard boundaries on responsibilities and accountability while ensuring independent decision-making. One comment mentions the disadvantages of putting everything in one machine, as it exposes a myriad of ports to the internet, while another mentions the advantages of configuring ports/IP addresses on a server.Hetzner is a reliable choice for personal use, but not for security-conscious companies due to lack of data encryption at rest and weaker physical access control compared to Google. An HN user points out that encryption is an option on Hetzner, but there is still a significant difference between the two. Another HN user highlights the importance of account redundancy over hardware failure in cloud infrastructure. Difficulties and red flags in identity verification for international customers is a concern for some customers using Hetzner. It is suggested to use physical backups or alternative hosts for added security.Various comments compare the ways different countries use identification for address purposes. In Germany, citizens are required to own a Personalausweis or Reisepass, which must reflect their current address. In Spain, the DNI includes an address, while the US does not have an official identification containing an address. Voter registration remains a contentious issue due to the cost and accessibility of voter ID cards, particularly for those in poverty, which carries emotional and legal ramifications regarding the right to vote. A discrepancy between address information on different forms of ID can signal suspicious behavior. Communication barriers, varying state laws, and unclear legal requirements are factors contributing to the complex system of obtaining identification for identification purposes.Hetzner, a cloud provider, has been receiving some negative feedback for its user verification policies. While some users have been using Hetzner for years without any issues, others have reported being banned from the platform when they couldn't verify their identity. Users speculate that Hetzner might be stricter with certain nationalities, and others believe that it's merely a way for the platform to combat fraud. Some have suggested using an alternative cloud provider if Hetzner's policies seem too restrictive.Hetzner's strict fraud policy has led to numerous account bans, with some customers allegedly being kicked off for not providing the correct passport. There are also concerns that scammers are using purchased Hetzner credentials to run malicious activities on its servers. However, some users report no KYC issues with the company. There are also discussions on the ARM Altra's per-thread performance and the compatibility issues that come with using ARM architecture, despite promising benchmarks. Some users suggest trying Alpine Linux to address missing package concerns.Hetzner is offering Altra servers with ARM architecture, running various distros. Some users point out potential issues with building software from scratch on ARM and missing packages on Debian. Hetzner's bandwidth is good, with some benchmarks showing speeds over 10 Gbps. However, some users have reported issues with signing up and being blocked. Some users also report good performance with ARM servers in data processing.Hetzner's new server plans have been introduced at an unbeatable price of \u20ac3.79 a month, including an IPv4 address and hourly billing option. In a sysbench CPU comparison between Intel and Arm 2 vCPU, a higher number of events per second can be achieved using Arm. However, 'openssl speed rsa' seems to be a more informative datapoint. ARM server instances are cheaper as ARM processors are simpler to produce, the market is two orders of magnitude greater than x86, and ARM's research costs are lower due to the company mainly focusing on licensing the designs and instruction sets.Hetzner offers ARM cloud servers with competitive pricing and good performance, but some users have experienced issues with hardware design. A possible reason for the low prices of ARM servers is the diversity of competitors within the ecosystem, although there is currently only one competitor for buying a server ARM chip. Power delivery and cooling are not cheap at datacenter levels, particularly in Europe, where the war in Ukraine caused significant price increases in 2021. Hetzner also has cloud servers and an API to provision them, but no managed services like databases or blob storage.Hetzner previously stopped offering dedicated servers with GPUs due to fraud and abuse by crypto miners, but may begin offering them again with precautions for AI. Limited supply of outdated hardware is currently available in the server auction section. There is uncertainty about the launch of GPU rentals after a chat support implied it was imminent. Users hope dedicated-core plans will also roll out for GPUs. Some question whether Hetzner will be able to maintain their low prices in Europe due to high energy costs.",

        "hn_content": "The new NASA director recently swore their oath on Carl Sagan's book \"Pale Blue Dot\", rather than on the Bible, Quran or other document, marking the first time a Sagan book has been used. In the past and during political campaigns, others have used various printed matter ranging from Dr. Suess books to Superman Comics. While taking an oath on a meaningful, personalized document can help to remind someone of their values, as these studies suggest it generally prompts them to answer tests and questions more honestly, ultimately a document or book is not a legal requirement for taking an oath of office.A recent post on Hacker News discusses the effectiveness of oaths in keeping people true to their convictions, with some users suggesting that reminders of one's beliefs can be helpful in staying true to oneself. While some believe that an oath sworn over a religious text provides a sense of accountability through the belief in a higher power, others argue that this is a flawed premise and that the power of an oath comes from the individual's own convictions. The post also features discussions on the value of symbolism and religious beliefs in accountability.The comments section debates the significance of swearing an oath on a sacred text like the Bible or a book that represents one's values. Some argue that the belief in repercussions for breaking an oath taken on a sacred text is irrelevant while others suggest that oaths have historical and natural reverence. The conversation shifts to discussing the true meaning of personal responsibility, the nature of faith, and its impact on behavior. There is tension between those who wish to denigrate others' faith and those who suggest showing more decorum.Comments on Hacker News range from criticism over religious oaths in government roles to society's attempt at rationality as a replacement to political and religious institutions. The conversation touches on the accountability of non-religious oaths, the relevance of the book that is being used for an oath, and the importance of respecting social norms. Some comments argue the impracticality of building a utopia of radical individuals while others dive into the ideologies of Ayn Rand.A discussion on whether swearing on a religious book has any meaning or not has taken place on HN. Some users believe that a person who doesn't believe in religion being sworn in on a religious book is not going to feel loyal to it; instead, they should swear on something that has personal value and meaning to them. The distinction between an oath and an affirmation has also been discussed, and some users believe that choosing something personally meaningful is appropriate, whether it's a religious text, a constitution, or a science text.UK and US citizenship ceremonies require an oath or affirmation to the state, and there are options for religious and non-religious citizens. Becoming a UK citizen can allow someone to live and work there and throughout the EU, and also has complex ancestry exceptions. Neither UK nor US law bars dual citizenship from Parliament or government. Interestingly, historical myths abound about the origins of swearing on objects when taking oaths.A discussion on swearing oaths without religious symbolism has taken place on Hacker News. Some find it necessary to have a representation of a deity as a guarantor for the oath, while others view the ceremony as symbolic. The founders of the US questioned their own traditions on religion when founding the nation, as did Thomas Jefferson, who edited a Bible version without miracles. Choosing a non-religious object, like an eagle feather, can be seen as more authentic to one's personal beliefs. Certain rituals and the symbolism behind them can be lost in translation due to literally taking things out of context.The religious aspect of swearing on an object for emphasis is considered a traditional ritual. However, modern beliefs hold that rituals create a clear line with both internal and external pressures not to cross that line. The Christian faith accepts mankind's inherent imperfection and inability to avoid sinning. The concept of 'antisinning' in Christianity aligns with Progressive antiracist rhetoric, presenting 'original sin' repackaged with racism replacing sinning. A key takeaway from the discussion is that improvement requires acknowledging imperfection, which is applicable across 'industries.' The ambiguity of natural language supports the idea of implicit and symbolic ideas.A discussion on swearing on the Bible arises on a forum. One user points out that some truly Bible-believing people won't swear on anything because of the Bible's aversion to oaths. The Bible's logical inconsistencies are also addressed. Ultimately, one user believes that the Bible is cautioning against deception, whether to yourself or others. Another user reminds readers that while the Bible prohibits oaths, it also states that you should follow the land's rules and regulations, demonstrating the book's contradictions. Additionally, a non-Christian user chimes in and argues that love for God and one's neighbor is the crux of the matter in the Bible.Comments on an article about swearing an oath on a book featuring archaic language and usage, including an explanation of the purpose of the use of \"thine\" and \"mine,\" and commentary on the use of a book from Western civilization. Other comments focus on the solemnity and symbolism of taking an oath, including the importance of personal values and beliefs to individual commitments. One user suggests that taking an oath on a book by Carl Sagan is more important and serious than swearing on any god or deity.Makenzie rejoices the inclusion of a Sagan book instead of the Bible in her swearing-in ceremony at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Public swearing to God breaks the third commandment in American Protestant culture. Ten Commandments, written by God, were kept inside the Ark of the Covenant, while ceremonial laws were written by Moses and stored beside it. Some believe that swearing on a book of moral philosophy, you agree with, could be a better option than the Bible. Swearing in has ritualistic roles, and has been used to shape societies and history.The first law from Deuteronomy is quoted in Mark 12:30-31 KJV, which is to love the Lord with all your heart, and to love your neighbor as yourself. This is also enshrined in the Ten Commandments, where the 4 first commandments talk about how God wants to be worshipped and the last 6 talk about how God wants people to treat each other. However, the Bible is not the only source of mores and norms to swear on, and swearing on a Sagan book may arguably be better as it's based on fact. Swearing in itself may not necessarily make a difference in whether someone keeps their promise or not, but rituals can still have meaning even in 2023.A discussion on Hacker News revolves around the idea that science is about observing facts, not about morals. Though religious texts may also be considered factual by true believers, scientific texts specifically lay out material facts, without any moral implications. The primary readers of the post are experts in the field, and the article contains no new or exciting information.",

        "hn_content": "Intel Foundry Services (IFS) has announced a collaboration with Arm to design SoCs, but an HN user questions the relevance of the comments about personal gaming rigs. IFS faces the challenge of competing with TSMC, and Intel has a long history of collaboration with Arm. A user reports the superior performance of a $1999 Mac Studio for programming and audio compared to a massive Intel gaming rig. However, another user emphasizes that Macs may not be ideal for video game development or CAD due to a lack of demand and cutting-edge hardware.Users discuss the Mac Studio, praising its compact size, lack of noise and heat, and power efficiency. While some critique the Studio for being overpriced and not as powerful as other PC options, others argue the Mac's unique memory bandwidth makes it a hard device to outrun. HN users also discuss alternative keyboard options, the benefits of having a Mac Studio for AI inferencing, and the heat generated by Linux systems. Some users suggest undervolting CPUs to combat this issue. Overall, HN users weigh the pros and cons of the Mac Studio and compare it with other PC options.The AMD 2950x still performs well and the 5950x is even cheaper and faster, making it not worth it to get a Mac Studio for just chess engines. The M1's success may come from its ultrawide RAM interface that is easier to maintain signal integrity with, but it's not very different from anyone else's approach. The M1 Max is limited when focusing only on CPU bandwidth, but it shares bandwidth with the GPU. Intel missed out on potential phone processor sales due to their lack of confidence in the iPhone's success. The iPhone was a response to other cell phone makers integrating music-player functionality into their phones. Jobs anticipated the market shift to mobile computing and invested heavily in the iPhone.In a discussion about Intel & mobile computing, Tech Times readers point out possible reasons why the company missed out on the mobile revolution. Intel Atom development started in 2004, but the R&D was pumped into the desktop and server business, leading to a lack of commitment to mobile. There was a clear lack of senior leadership commitment to emerging tech, leading to an avoidable strategic misstep. ARM and Qualcomm were more exposed to competition and still managed to lead in their respective fields, illustrating the importance of investing in potential markets. Job experience and expertise, not just titles, are key predictors of success as a CEO, and salespeople can play a vital role in identifying future growth areas.   Intel has collaborated with ARM to offer its foundry services to create ARM-based chips. This could lead to Intel's fabrication business progressing into ARM-based products for mobile, IoT, and data centers. Intel CPUs for smartphones have been plagued with compatibility and performance problems, whereas ARM-based chips now dominate such markets. Intel is trying to leverage its dominant position to strengthen and diversify its business. Intel's inability to keep its fabs busy/profitable with just its designs is the primary reason for the current development. Most importantly, this collaboration creates an alternative route for companies that can't afford TSMC's latest and greatest silicon.The Tech Times article discusses reducing dependence on Taiwanese silicon for geopolitical reasons; the comments cover IOT devices and manufacturing, with possible alternatives including ARM Cortex M33 and M0+ microcontrollers and fabs in geopolitically stable regions. The article and comments also cover Intel's 2nm node production expected to start in H1 2024, although concerns about their ability to meet this timetable are raised. Additionally, skepticism about Intel's statements arises due to its missed deliverables, while the article and comments also acknowledge the importance of power consumption, price, and wireless capability in the development of IOT devices.Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger may have stopped Intel's self-sabotage, leading commentator argues, leading to innovations with leading-edge chips. An HN user points out Intel's stumbling with 'Intel 4nm' and delivery date of N2 to be in 2024H2. Intel Foundry Services is collaborating with a competitor, ARM, to stay competitive in the market while ensuring IP safety. Some HN commenters also engage in humor and sarcasm regarding the naming of Intel Foundry Services and the potential for Intel to make money from it.",

        "hn_content": "An EVE Online player managed to pull off the biggest heist in the game's history using an obscure rule, raising questions around how it was even possible to get these shares. A Reddit thread suggests the CEO was barely active, and the new CEO's appointment was not noticed for 72 hours. Other comments suggest that the heist was similar to corporate raiding scams in Russia, and that a well-known scam involved using shares to gain control of someone else's corporation. It is unclear how the perpetrator got the shares, but it is certain that the use of shares to steal corp assets is an old scam.Comments on HN discuss experiences with gaming and the sense of community it can create; pay-to-win games like Lords Mobile and Rise of Kingdoms can be compelling because of the shared commitment and drama created; some discuss experiences of falling into compulsive play and spending large amounts of money, while others argue that the experience of being a part of a serious gaming community can also be valuable, providing personal development and teaching skills like leadership and patience.A recent incident in Eve Online, a massively multiplayer online game, has sparked arguments about the game's mechanics and wasted opportunities. The incident involved corporate espionage and the exploitation of a loophole in the game's system, leading to accusations and debates over whether it was a feature or a bug. Many users expressed frustration with the game's primitive corporate mechanics and its development team's focus on \"walking in stations\" and planet stuff. Some comments mentioned the potential for blockchain technology to improve the game's mechanics and create new possibilities for virtual worlds and players.CCP Games is facing criticism for allowing rogue players to conduct takeover attacks on gaming platforms like EVE, although the rules may be designed for entertainment and engagement instead of being business-friendly. These gamers have reportedly stolen millions using decentralized finance's (DeFi) flash loans, which allow them to attack without significant starting capital. The comments suggest that these DeFi projects have created a parallel economy of unwhitelisted transactions, and are possibly backed by endless speculative capital, making the risks associated with DeFi much higher. Nevertheless, the players' activities have remained entertaining for EVE players that find their niche, such as wormholes and exploration.A two-series book about war stories is engaging to read, with comments focused on playing the game EVE Online. One commenter recounts their experience with joining groups for classes and skills, with a desire to try multiplayer wormholing. Other comments detail stealth bombers' usefulness against battleship fleets and successful bombings during battles. Some express concerns about the game\u2019s investment and doubt its long-term value. One HN user advised against prioritizing game time over real life. Overall, concerns about the game's gameplay and mechanics are emphasized.EVE Online players discuss their experiences with the game and why it may be losing its appeal. Some feel that the game is primarily focused on financial gain, rather than a rich gaming experience. Others recount their experiences with players exploiting the inattentiveness of others to pull off the biggest heist in game history. It's noted that the game's economy can be difficult to understand, as in-game items and currency are often tied to real-world subscription costs. Trading in-game currency for real money is not allowed, although there is a black market for it.The article discusses the story of an EVE Online corporation that lost $22,000 due to a CEO takeover. However, some comments point out that the article overlooks the fact that the CEO had 100% of the shares, which means they already had complete control over the company. There are speculation and rumors about how the CEO got these shares, and some suggest it may involve real money trading. The article and comments also discuss the game's mechanics, such as the CEO voting mechanics and the default number of shares in newly created corporations. Some comments also challenge the article's mention of a dollar value for the lost assets.A heist in the game EVE Online was successful as an attacker made off with 2.23 trillion ISK valued at $22,300 without any moderator intervention, highlighting the game's libertarian approach. EVE Online's corporate system has a requirement for members to provide API keys, although the attacker played the system by creating a new account with no history and transferring shares. The game has a complex structure of infrastructure and ownership where exploitative hacks are commonplace, like the wormhole space in which an alliance leader sold a player's assets outside the corporation. The financial value of game currency like ISK is based on Plex, which can be traded with real money.A heist orchestrated by a player named Flam_Hill in the online game, EVE Online, exploited the game's shares mechanic to infiltrate and gain control of the corporation. They systematically removed other directors and emptied the corporate wallet of 130 billion ISK, and stole assets from the corporation's high-security offices, with the estimated value of the heist at 2.23 trillion ISK or approximately $22,309 USD. The heist was seen as cool, and there isn't a good way for Pandemic Horde alliance to retaliate against them as the players responsible were gone from the corp, and the money too. There is no direct analogy for something like this committing in real life.Courts generally allow CEOs and boards to decide what's best for a company, as long as there is no conflict of interest. Asset selling and earnings distribution to all shareholders is likely acceptable, but not to just the CEO. YC Summer 2023 applications are now open.",
