    "hn_content": "Ruff, a Python linter built on Rust, is being developed by a team able to work on the tool full-time thanks to a VC raise; the author of Maturin (Rust+Python interop) is also involved. Ruff is a fast, all-in-one tool that parses underlying Python files only once and can thereby carry out additional functionality very cheaply. The tool is faster than alternatives that do type checking, and performs well on codebases without type hints. Possible business models for open source linters like Ruff include expandable ecosystems, support contracts, custom features, commercial products, and telemetry. Accel, who backed Vercel and Sentry, are among the \"good ones\" when it comes to VC companies.- Ruff, a fast and easy-to-use Python linter, can replace multiple tools\n- Ruff's creator, Charlie Marsh, is skilled and versatile in Python and Rust, having created a tool with a strong product vision\n- Ruff currently focuses on linting and will be getting more autoformatting capabilities in the future\n- Users hope Ruff will be exposed as a Python module or API in the future for even more streamlined usagePython toolchain tools like Ruff and Astral are essential to empowering users who use Python as a glue language in various contexts from web to data science without modification of legacy code. These toolchain improvements need to be written below the GIL or in the compiler. Python's popularity is attributed to its utility/scripting capabilities but has drawbacks such as the lack of a standard package manager, dependency resolution, etc. The future of Python lies in data science, and web development is on the decline compared to Node.js. Tooling in Python may be slow due to the poorly implemented language execution.- Python is considered readable and great for small-scale non-production usage \n- One user argues Python is not at the top of languages in terms of readability and preventing production mistakes \n- Another user disagrees with the comparison of Python to pseudocode \n- Linter taking multiple seconds is seen as a problem in specific cases, but not a widespread issue \n- One user prefers using C# over Python for more involved applications \n- Ruff is a new, faster alternative to Python for linting \n- The decision to make a new tool instead of participating in the existing Python community is seen as disappointing by some users \n- The Flake8 linting ecosystem in Python has a lot of investment and community progress \n- There should be no downside to adding bespoke Flake8 plugins for users with custom needs \n- The potential impact of micro-optimizations like choosing Rust over Python is minimalDevelopers debate the potential success of Ruff, a new Python linter tool that promises faster results than existing options. Some argue that a faster linter isn't enough to create a successful company, while others suggest that Ruff's creators could monetize through supply-chain security, managed builds, and other services. Critics also note that Ruff would have to compete with existing, widely-used Python linters like flake8 and pylint. Supporters argue, however, that Ruff could be just the beginning, potentially leading to more products aimed at improving the entire Python ecosystem's tooling.- Ruff is a fast Python linter written in Rust.\n- It has a speed advantage over other Python linters, making it live-update as one types.\n- It is capable of detecting over 500 lint rules, including those of Flake8, isort, and pyupgrade.\n- Ruff supports the LSP and integrates well with editors.\n- Astral Software Inc is the company that created Ruff.A new project called Astral, led by former Facebook engineer Charlie Marsh, aims to provide fast and easy-to-use Python development tools. The first tool developed is Ruff, a fast and reliable linter designed to support most Python coding standards. Ruff's performance has been shown to be significantly better than other linters like PyLint and Flake8, even when dealing with significant amounts of code such as the entire CPython codebase. While Ruff is not designed to replace tools like Black, it benefits from being written in Rust, allowing it to lint code quickly and efficiently. It remains to be seen what further tools Astral will develop, but it's highly anticipated by the Python development community.- Astral.sh's CSS for clicked links is mistaken for normal text\n- Users seek compatibility with FastAPI and auto-formatters\n- Opinionated formatting and lack of type checking in Python criticized\n- Ruff's speed and wide rule coverage impress users\n- Python's accessibility cited as a cause for its popularity and perceived inefficiency\n- Users question Ruff's benefits beyond speed and how the company is expected to profit.",

These firms have already been forced to take out expensive loans or ask investors for more money due to a miserable VC market.Small software firms across the US are facing massive tax bills that could threaten their survival, according to an investigation by CNBC.

Making friends as an adult is just hard10:56DownloadNovember 10, 2021Peter O'DowdTwitterKalyani SaxenaTwitterFriends holding cups of coffee. (Getty Images)This article is more than 1 year old.This segment was rebroadcast on July 20, 2022. Click here for that audio.Marisa G. Franco's new book on the science of making and keeping friends \"Platonic\" comes out on Sept. 6.WBUR is a nonprofit news organization. Our coverage relies on your financial support. If you value articles like the one you're reading right now, give today.When you were a kid, it seemed like you could walk up to just about anybody and be best friends the next minute. But somewhere along the long, winding road to adulthood, making new friends became an impossibly hard thing to do.Well according to psychologist and University of Maryland professor Marisa G. Franco, that\u2019s because as you get older, making friends no longer happens organically.\u201cSociologists have kind of identified the ingredients that need to be in place for us to make friends organically, and they are continuous unplanned interaction and shared vulnerability,\u201d says Franco, who is writing a book on making friends as an adult. \u201cBut as we become adults, we have less and less environments where those ingredients are at play.\u201dTips for forming new friendships:\u2022 Be intentional about making friends\u2022 Set up planned and regular interactions\u2022 Assume that people already like you\u2022 Make the ask and get contact information when you connect with someone\u2022 Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself\u2022 Keep putting yourself out thereIf we continue to expect friendships to happen naturally like they did when we were kids, we run the risk of waiting for something that might never come. Being intentional is essential, she says. Research shows those who view friendships as something that happens because of luck are lonelier later on in life, she says, \u201cand those who see it as something that happens based on effort are less lonely years later.\u201dJuliana Clark, a 25-year-old audio producer living in Los Angeles, says that while she\u2019s been able to make a few friends here and there, she is mostly looking for a community. Spending a few minutes with a new acquaintance doesn\u2019t usually leave her with a feeling that a new friendship is blossoming.\u201cI'm really more interested in kind of creating a sustainable community that will last,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially since at least so many of the friendships that I've made just in my life have kind of had these common experiences anchoring them.\u201dAccording to Franco, the key to building a community of friends is setting up planned interactions, like regular group events or rotating potlucks.\u201cResearchers also find that when we develop groups, our friendships are more sustainable than they are with individuals. Because there's multiple touch points now, right? Someone else in the group could reach out to all of us, and then we all keep in touch,\u201d she notes.If that sounds terrifying to you, Franco says it\u2019s crucial to assume that people already like you. Assume any meet ups will go well, she says, which in turn will help build up your confidence.ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWe all have this tendency to think we're more likely to be rejected than we actually are,\u201d she says.How age, gender play a role in forming friendshipsAs we move through life, our struggles change. People in their 30s and their 40s have voiced how having kids or moving to a new city made it tough for them to form connections.Kate Hickcox, 42, moved to Maine from New York City with her husband in 2018. The mom of two young children says she and her husband still haven't met any new friends in their more rural life. The pandemic worsened the situation since making plans was off the table.\u201cI'm also a city girl. I often feel like an outsider when trying to engage with those in my new local Maine community who either grew up here and have established connections or those who moved here because of their love of nature and the outdoors,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I could force friendship to happen by attending events or participating in local sports or activities.\u201dFranco says people like Hickcox shouldn\u2019t be too hard on themselves because making friends is tough no matter who you are. She recommends working to overcome covert avoidance \u2014 when you show up to an event but are mentally checked out.\u201cYou're on your phone, you're waiting for people to come to you, you're not introducing yourself to people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's not just that you have to attend that event, but you have to overcome covert avoidance by engaging with people when you get there.\u201dIt\u2019s essential to take the extra step and ask for contact information.\u201cThat's really, really key to take it from, \u2018Hey, I'm putting myself out there\u2019 to \u2018We're actually going to form a connection and begin to form a friendship,\u2019 \u201d Franco adds.There's also a number of people who find themselves more and more isolated as they get older. David Troxel never got married and never had children. The 64 year old says that he's been socially disconnected for the last 10 years or more.\u201cI find that typically, people have all or most of the social connections that they can manage,\u201d Troxel says. \u201cI met somebody several years ago that I thought I might get to be friends with and invited them out to have coffee with me. I was told that this person really had all the friends that they need.\u201dFranco says men often have more trouble making friends than women because of the way society perceives them. Men are also more likely to rely on their romantic partners for a social network.\u201cThere's this phenomenon called homohysteria, which is the fear of being perceived as gay that I think really, really is destructive for men's friendships,\u201d she says.Eventually, loneliness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201cIf you are in a place of loneliness, you are, according to the research, more likely to assume people are going to reject you,\u201d Franco explains. \u201cYou're just sort of hyper vigilant for rejection and social threats. You're more likely to think that social interactions will be more negative and less enjoyable.\u201dThat\u2019s why she says it\u2019s of the utmost importance for people like Troxel to keep putting themselves out there.\u201cYou had this one negative experience. It had sucked. Someone said they had too many friends, right?,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that certainly doesn't mean that everybody has too many friends, and that certainly doesn't mean that there aren't people out there that are just waiting for you to connect with them,\u201d she says.The world is likely more open to you than you think it is, Franco adds, and there\u2019s a chance more people out there want to be your friend.Kalyani Saxena produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Chris Bentley.

One commentator suggests the idea of a weekly hang, which is a socially porous experience with a fixed location and start time that allows for people to drop in and out. Others suggest that shared activities, like pool or brunch, can help foster sustainable friendships. The importance of multiple touch points in sustaining friendships with groups is emphasized as it allows for more excitement, fun, and ease in scheduling hangs.The article discusses ways to make new friends and form connections. The author suggests that proximity when eating is a consistent way to form friendships, such as through communal living spaces or regular meetups at the same pub or park. Other suggestions include joining a board game meetup or a running group. The comment section provides anecdotes and additional suggestions for finding social networks, such as through social fitness or by joining Facebook or Meetup groups.The post shares personal stories of how group fitness classes or running clubs helped people overcome loneliness and make new friends. The shared adversity of exercise strengthens social bonds, and the shared goal of getting in shape gives an easy formula for making friends. Some groups also extend to participating in charity races or attending weddings. Despite hesitations from men trying to make friends with women in fitness classes, most groups are social and welcoming to newcomers. Readers are encouraged to take off their headphones and join a fitness group to improve their social and physical well-being.Tech professionals discuss group activities for meeting new people and making friends, including Hash House Harriers, Parkrun, and church events. Weekly gatherings with a central activity, such as trivia, board games, or bouldering, are suggested for building a community. Personal anecdotes and suggestions for starting a group are shared. Some express difficulty finding groups that align with their interests or schedule.A person expresses their disinterest in the tech industry and preference for money and building things. Discussion ensues regarding whether money attracts interesting people, and the difficulty of organizing group hangouts as people get older and have families. The importance of cultivating friendships through shared hobbies is highlighted. One-on-one hangouts are seen as rewarding, but not self-maintaining, and group hangouts have the potential for shared purpose and renewed connection. The strategy of organizing brunches with acquaintances is seen as fruitless.The discussion on group hangouts reveals different perspectives on the dynamics and preferences of socializing in groups. Some individuals find groups too shallow and competitive, while others enjoy the variety of conversations and avoiding awkward one-on-one situations. Factors such as interests and gender balance may dictate the success of group hangouts. Common hobbies like tabletop games provide more opportunities for socializing. People becoming friends with each other and initiating events without the group originator is seen as positive.The Tech Times' comments section includes discussions on introversion vs. extroversion, feelings about having or not having friends, and recommendations for books on psychology. Users suggest that extroverts require external stimulation to feel alive, while introverts need downtime to reconcile with inner stimulation. Many introverts guard their alone time and can be content without many friends, but also worry about the effect of their absence in the universe of social interactions. Some users suggest theories on why some people may feel the way they do and recommend books on related topics.The difficulty of finding close friends and relationships as an adult due to busy lives and differing interests is a common challenge. Having deep connections with people with similar values and interests is a desire for many, but can be tough. While life priorities change, maintaining friendships can be a lower item on a never-ending list. Despite this, some have found success connecting with others through various activities such as cycling, volunteer work or interest-based groups. Overall, the challenge in making and maintaining adult friendships remains a societal issue, regardless of geographic location.The comments section discusses the difficulty of making friends as an adult, especially in new environments or during COVID. Suggestions include finding common interests, asking questions, and being intentional in relationships. Some users suggest using apps like Peanut or Bumble, while others argue for the need for a dedicated app for explicitly making friends. A side note mentions the importance of introducing friends to each other and taking the initiative to reach out. One commenter notes the added difficulty for immigrants to make friends.Making friends as an immigrant can be difficult, even in big cities. Expats tend to stick together, but some find it hard to make long-term friends in those circles. It's important to adapt to local communication and relationship norms, and to make an effort to mingle with natives and others from different nationalities. Language and country of origin can also impact friend-making opportunities. For some, finding a gathering place for like-minded people can be challenging, especially if they don't drink, attend church, or have kids. Making friends is possible, but may require effort and an open mind.Commenters suggest shared-interest clubs, sports teams, and volunteer work are good ways to make new friends. Bars can be hit or miss, depending on one's personality and the atmosphere. Making friends requires a significant investment of time and effort that some people may not have. Meeting people in India seems easier than in some developed countries due to population density and a greater willingness to create social connections. Joining a group that involves exercise can bring about physical and mental health benefits.There is no meaningful tech news content in this post.

    "hn_content": "Developers discuss their experiences using Language Model (LLM) prompts for programming. While LLM prompts can provide useful boilerplate and break down complex projects, they can also be limited by token limits and the risk of hallucinating or forgetting previous tasks. Users recommend starting a new prompt chain for each different thought process and avoiding irrelevant questions to stay on track. The new version of LLM, GPT-4, shows significant improvement over its predecessor, GPT-3. The conversation also touches on the usefulness of LLM prompts in anti-procrastination and decision-making processes.Artificial intelligence (AI) is not necessarily lowering the barrier to entry for coding tasks, according to some comments on Hacker News concerning the use of large language models (LLMs) for coding. For laypeople to work effectively with LLMs, they must have a deep understanding of technical language and concepts. Effective use of LLM will require nuanced understanding beyond simply describing the code. LLMs can produce code, but there are limitations to what they can do, and maintenance is a significant issue. It is possible that frameworks or libraries are better options than writing new code from scratch repeatedly.- Language and LLM can reason about semantics and generate elegant proofs\n- LLM can write prompts and self introspect to debug\n- We need better, precise specifications to ensure programs are correct\n- LLMs could speed up aerospace work but may not offer the same kind of leverage as other projects\n- English language spec is fuzzy and ambiguous, can't be avoided\n- Still need human input to form a mental model of the thing being implemented\n- Extant AIs are notorious for doubling down instead of accepting correction\n- AI lacks real-world context and understanding, making intuitive leaps less likely to yield useful results\n- The ability to form a coherent, novel theory and an experiment to test it is key to scientific progress and something these models are fundamentally incapable of doing\n- LLMs are analogous to the jump between assembly and higher-level compiled languagesAI-assisted tools are improving the software development process, but they haven't yet solved the problem that creating software requires work. The argument that AI won't replace artists because they can use AI is flawed, as demonstrated by layoffs in China's video game industry. The use of AI in programming creates instructions for someone to write code, but the programmer may interpret them in unintended ways, creating errors. However, eventually, GPT may become an add-on in VSCode and could know about the entire codebase, allowing it to provide guidance and suggestions for refactoring and upgrading.- AI tools are rapidly improving and should be experimented with to find their best use-cases\n- While AI tools like LLMs may be useful, they are not drop-in replacements for human developers or commercial artists\n- As mid-level cognitive tasks get automated by LLMs, some well-paying white-collar jobs may be eliminated, leading to economic dislocation and social disruption in oligarchic capitalist societies\n- Social-democratic societies with effective governance and universal basic income may be advantaged in this new economic order, resulting in a shift in geopolitical balance of power\n- It is unclear how future training data for AI tools will be sourced, but Github discussions on issues alongside actual working code are a likely option\n- The productivity gain from AI tools like Copilot is massive, but it is unlikely to result in headcount reduction as competition will also have similar productivity gains.- The average AI company has significantly fewer employees per valuation than typical tech companies.\n- The movement of getting blue-collar workers to code seems to have lost its steam.\n- Some AI language learning models struggle when building an agent due to a high number of tokens required to template prompts.\n- Copilot is seen as a better tool for code development than ChatGPT.\n- There is a need for a move from prompt-helper to pattern language for visually reporting the process of working with AI language learning models.Developers discuss their experiences using GPT-4 and Copilot for coding, with mixed opinions on their usability and effectiveness. Several users find GPT-4's chat interface cumbersome, preferring Copilot's ability to generate smaller chunks of code. However, Copilot's output is criticized as being mostly boilerplate, and there are concerns about reliance on AI-generated code. GitHub claims that Copilot generates 40% of code written by its users. Several users highlight the importance of having real documentation available to supplement AI-generated code. Overall, users express excitement about the potential of these tools but caution about overreliance on them.The post discusses the use of ChatGPT and Copilot for coding purposes. ChatGPT is an AI language model that can help with scripting AWS-related code, CloudFormation templates, and PowerShell. It can understand natural language and requirements but lacks in nuanced specifications. Copilot, on the other hand, is a code generation tool that can produce whole classes and validate output against specifications. It can also explain existing code and has codebrushes to transform and explain code. However, it requires trust in Microsoft to discard sensitive code fragments. Some commenters suggest adding teaching mode or running locally.Microsoft's GitHub Copilot for Business has prompted concerns about potential mismanagement and retention of code. Users are advised not to include confidential information in the prompts. While some believe it is unlikely that Microsoft will misuse the data collected, others caution that it could be used for spying, and a few strategic companies are likely to be given special treatment. However, GitHub has stated that code snippets data transmitted in real-time is immediately discarded once used, and is not retained. The suggested data is analysed by a machine algorithm, not human eyes.OpenAI's language model tool, ChatGPT, is being used by software developers to automate the coding of repetitive or boilerplate code, and to complete complex coding tasks. However, there are concerns about how ChatGPT handles data privacy, and the accuracy of the generated code. The prompts used to generate code must be carefully crafted, which requires some coding knowledge. ChatGPT's success depends largely on the quality of its prompts. Additionally, there are concerns about the ethics of relying on language models to generate code, and whether this could lead to job losses in the software development industry.Developers are experimenting with OpenAI's natural language models such as GPT-3 to write code. The responses generated by the language model require an iterative process to fine-tune the prompt and get accurate code. However, prompts must also be carefully curated to avoid revealing proprietary code. The approach may be useful for rapid prototyping and generating clear, single-function codes. It could be used in a broader linting tool that automatically generates and suggests appropriate code patterns. Several companies, including OpenAI, are introducing similar capabilities for generating code via prompts.The author shares their experience using OpenAI's language model for prompt-based coding. They suggest that prompt-based coding can save time and be easy if you have domain knowledge but can be a difficult learning curve if you do not know how to code. Learning is aided by explanations of returned code, although it can be verbose. There are upsides and downsides with high temperature for coding. There is no external dependency, and all graphics are procedurally generated. LLMs can save cookie-cutter work and lead to more polished prompts. ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo was used, costing ~$6 in OpenAI fees so far.An online conversation on the use of AI in programming tools:\n\n- ChatGPT can handle new tasks fine as long as they don't match existing token sequences.\n- Vitest struggles to understand information provided to it, limiting its usefulness.\n- One commentator imagines a different direction for programming and critiques existing techniques and standards.\n- Some popular aspects of web programming are described as contrived/derivative with repetitive syntax.\n- There is a discussion on programming techniques from the past, and the promise of AI to help rapidly prototype innovative tools.\n- One commentator thinks these AI programming tools create complexity for no benefit.\n- Another commentator has yet to find a use case for the AI programming tools.- A programmer is discussing their use of ChatGPT, a conversational AI, for help with unfamiliar programming languages and basic tasks like looking up word definitions.\n- They have set it up as a convenient function within their REPL to save time and effort.\n- Another commenter questions the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for verbalizing thoughts and asking obvious questions, but the original poster finds it useful for tackling more complex problems or finding alternative solutions.\n- There is no new or exciting tech development, but the post offers insight into how AI can assist programmers in their work.",

Users\u2019 anecdotes point to how European towns, which were designed in\u202fcircles, are much more densely populated with services within walking distances while many American suburbs have only the basic services at a greater distance with limited public transport options. The discussion has also highlighted the benefits of walkable communities for physical and social health.A discussion thread on living in small towns versus larger cities, with examples from various locations in Europe and the US. Some people prefer small towns for their community closeness and nature, while others like the density and diversity of larger cities. Factors such as walking distance to amenities, ease of transportation, and level of privacy also come into play. The definitions of town versus city can vary by country and region. In general, higher building density allows for more efficient use of space and convenient access to resources.The discussion highlights the contrast between European and American urban planning, with European cities tending to have more mixed-use zoning and walkable neighborhoods. There is criticism of American zoning laws that prohibit small shops and stores in residential areas, leading to a prevalence of suburban sprawl that can feel isolated and car-dependent. Some individuals argue that suburbs can be a good place to raise children, offering safety and a diverse community. Ultimately, the debate revolves around personal preference and what makes a community feel like home.There is no meaningful content in this post.There is no meaningful content in the text provided.The comments section of this post discusses the state of parks and public spaces in North America and Europe, including their accessibility, purpose, and social implications. Some argue that limited access to green spaces in the US is due to urban sprawl and restrictive park regulations. Others question the role of cafes and their potential to foster a sense of community in a post-religious era. Overall, the comments highlight the importance of public space as a critical resource for social interaction and community-building.The comment section highlights the issue of socializing and the challenge of transportation in the US, with some individuals preferring public transport while others prefer driving. There is a debate about the safety of walking drunk in some areas and the cost of using ride-sharing services, which may discourage some people from going out.

Crime rates in certain areas are also discussed, and there is a debate about whether to be cautious or enjoy life without fear.No meaningful tech content present in the text.Residents of major cities have grown accustomed to the constant noise levels and lack of respite, with one commenter discussing how a nearby building site no longer bothers them. However, others note the toll it takes on mental health and the appeal of living in the countryside. The discussion shifts to urban design and density, with some arguing for easier building of infill developments and increased access to public transportation, while others criticize the trendy fixation on bikes and density as the solution to all problems. Overall, the discussion touches on issues of urban living and community building.Living in a city can be advantageous, as density makes distances to friends shorter, and gatherings can occur more spontaneously. However, it can also make it harder to make friends in the first place. Traffic affects neighbor interaction, and car culture in the US is problematic. In Japan, work expectations and schooling, as well as societal pressures, contribute to social isolation. Suburbs can be friendlier than cities, with more socializing and the ability to make friends more easily. Parking in dense areas can be a challenge, with solutions like valet parking or paid garages being pricey. Rural towns and walkable mixed-use urban areas are preferable, as they offer convenience and community.Comments on HN discuss the reasons why people today are less likely to interact/deal with their neighbors, and how it affects their mental well-being. Factors such as private spaces, poor zoning policies, car-centric zoning, distrust, and loss of community have been identified as contributing to this issue. Additionally, some HN users suggest that small towns are friendlier while others argue that housing and accommodation, not overpopulation, cause problems in bigger cities.There is a discussion about the division between rural towns and big cities. Someone argues that stores and restaurants should be more distributed, but others point out that minorities may not have a good experience in rural towns due to history and the lack of diversity. Meanwhile, some argue that cities like Tokyo function well despite being overcrowded, but others point out that living in small towns offers walkability, bikeability, fresh air, and diverse communities. There is also a debate about urbanism and accessibility to tools and space for hobbies. Makerspaces can provide access to expensive tools and a community for shared learning.The post includes a discussion about the benefits and limitations of urban and rural lifestyles. It features comments from individuals who prefer either urban or rural living, with a focus on the availability of resources and opportunities.

One comment notes that the law requires companies to allow separate consent for different types of data processing, while another notes that requiring acceptance of ads or payment for content is legal but forcing users to accept tracking is not. There is no new or exciting development discussed in the thread.A website uses dark patterns to make users accept tracking. Users can bypass this by using NoScript or uMatrix. The cookie prompt is a cancerous pattern that users want to avoid. The EU government websites also have a similar prompt but with a clear \"I refuse cookies\" option. A header for users to signal that they don't want cookies previously existed (DNT:0) but tracking companies refused to cooperate. The prompt is a legal grey area that users can bypass with the right tools.- Incognito mode does not protect against browser fingerprinting which is why GDPR exists.\n- Proposal for a default flag of notrack:true instead of in favor of tracking.\n- Clearing cookies also clears local storage, but not other forms of fingerprinting like canvas and entropy.\n- One suggestion is to defend oneself with technical measures that actually work.\n- GDPR allows cookies for managing logins, but prompts are required for advertising/tracking cookies.\n- The ePrivacy Regulation may streamline the consent process for tracking cookies and other identifiers.\n- Websites have an obvious conflict of interest in managing cookies, but browsers don't know the purpose of any particular cookie.\n- Laws can be adapted to address problems, despite being complicated.A potential solution to cookie consent prompts is to mandate browser handling of standardized cookie descriptions, allowing standardized UI and preventing dark UI patterns. \"Do Not Track\" is not a sufficient alternative. Privacy policies also do not adequately inform users of privacy-impacting decisions. Cookie prompts are often user-hostile and extensions, adblocker lists or local storage can be used to block them or remember preferences. Functional cookies are allowed without a prompt but remembering cookie preferences is not strictly necessary or requested, and judges may interpret the law differently depending on the intent of the law.Certain regulations, such as GDPR, require websites to obtain consent for placing cookies and user data. Users express frustration with constant cookie consent pop-ups on various websites. Cookie AutoDelete and I Don't Care About Cookies are popular browser extensions to automatically remove cookies and cookie pop-ups. Users raise privacy concerns with websites tracking them despite disabling cookies. Users suggest more stringent regulations for Big Tech's user tracking practices. The main issue with cookie consent dialogs is extracting value from website users. Denying consent is often in the user's best interest.Firefox is introducing a new feature that automatically blocks third-party tracking cookies, with users having the option to accept or reject the prompt. Some users have suggested simple solutions to cater to user preferences, but Firefox is hoping this protection will help users choose how their data is tracked online. While some are concerned about how to maintain logins, others feel that such prompts are no longer necessary, and all cookies should be blocked. Overall, while cookies should be explicitly permitted by users, there seems to be a lack of consensus on the best method for achieving this.- Brave browser has been focusing on privacy and security for a while.\n- Some commenters are wondering why it's not more popular among infosec-focused people.\n- YC has opened applications for its Summer 2023 program (not directly related to Brave or browser technology).",
    "hn_summary": "- Firefox is introducing a new feature to reject third-party tracking cookies.\n- Cookie prompts prevent users from having the option to reject cookies, which is necessary for consent parity.\n- The use of cookie pop-ups is a pattern invented by the industry to collect data without consent.\n- Regulations need to be implemented to prevent the industry from using dark patterns to maximize profits.\n- Developers discuss the ongoing debate surrounding cookies and privacy legislation, with some suggesting blocking third-party cookies as a solution.\n- GDPR requires user consent for tracking activities, but some suggest the burden should be on website owners to declare their use of cookies.\n- A potential solution is to mandate browser handling of standardized cookie descriptions to prevent dark UI patterns.\n- Privacy policies and cookie prompts often do not adequately inform users of privacy-impacting decisions.\n- Users are frustrated with constant cookie consent pop-ups and suggest more stringent regulations for Big Tech's user tracking practices.\n- Brave browser has been focusing on privacy and security for a while, but some commenters are wondering why it's not more popular among infosec-focused people."

If responses on Reddit is any indication, the response hasn't been great.The software vendor has for months been playing around with putting ads \u2013 or at least in the case of the Start Menu, notifications \u2013 about its services in the operating system as well as the Bing search engine, PCs, and other products.Talk of such notifications in the Start Menu began circulating in November 2022. In March, with the KB5023778 preview build, Microsoft began sending them out to a few users, with the promise the practice would be more widely deployed in the following months.With the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 23435 that was dropped into the Dev Channel late last week, the company is \"continuing the exploration of badging on the Start menu with several new treatments for users logging in with local user accounts to highlight the benefits of signing in with a Microsoft account (MSA),\" Amanda Langowski, principal product manager for the Windows Insider Program, and Brandon LeBlanc, senior program manager at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post.And it's all about signing up for a Microsoft account, with messages stressing such advantages as the ease of backing up the device, personalizing the security settings, and accessing data from anywhere. Also, an account means getting Microsoft 365 \u2013 and all the cloud-native benefits \u2013 for free.Compatibility mess breaks not one but two Windows password toolsMicrosoft mucks with PrtScr key for first time in decadesMicrosoft deigns to fix five-year-old Defender bug that slowed FirefoxMicrosoft wants to stick adverts in Bing chat responsesLangowski and LeBlanc reiterated that Redmond uses the Dev Channel to try out various concepts to get comments. They could also find some feedback from users on Reddit, many of whom are not happy about the idea.\"This is what a monopoly is like adding in things to trick and inconvenience you,\" one user wrote. \"Whoops I just pushed an update that sets your browser to Edge, have ads as notifications and Teams and OneDrive unable to be removed from the system.\"They added: \"Honestly I want them to continue adding this \u2026 because the more they do it the more likely Windows will drive people elsewhere like the Chromebooks, Linux... etc. Legacy software will only keep people around for so long, enterprise will probably stick around for a long time but average consumers can do other things.\"\"The moment I see ads in the OS that I can't disable I'm out,\" another wrote. \"Tech is supposed to empower us, not capture us.\"That said, opinions about this are not universally negative. Having a couple of ads pop up on occasion is better than the alternative, one user noted.\"Thinking realistically, every software I use with the notable exception of Windows and DaVinci Resolve switched to a subscription model. If Microsoft doesn't do that and pushes its OneDrive and 365 subs via the task bar every now and then I'm personally okay with that. Better than paying $$$ every month just to use the OS.\"Others noted that there have been ads in both Windows 8 and 10 that hawked OneDrive, so what Microsoft is doing with Windows is nothing new and surprising, they said. And the ads are inevitable, another wrote.\"With how weak the public is these days I honestly don't see enough people making a fuss long enough for anything to be done, and this is going to become a norm,\" they wrote. \"It probably won't be as bad after they figure out the kinks, but it's gonna stay here forever with how people are.\" \u00aeSponsored: Is cloud repatriation part of your multicloud strategy?Similar topicsMicrosoft 365Operating SystemRedditMore like these93 COMMENTSTIP US OFFSend us news",

In response, commenters pointed out that companies should accept a \"No\" from their users, and that the customer ought to be right, rather than peppering them with pop-ups repeatedly. There may be a wider debate over the definition of \"customer\" in the context of ads, operating systems and products.Users should learn to say \"no\" to companies to resist their surveillance advertising economy. Change will come from users or regulation, and regulation seems unlikely. People should be aware that they are the product, not the customer for tech companies such as Windows 11. Many users will rationalize their cognitive dissonance, even if self-censorship is required. GDPR is an essential law that formalizes the notion of informed consent for computer interactions. Companies should be regulated to offer a \"No\" option that is equally represented and clearly stated, although this may be difficult to implement.The comments section of a Tech Times article discusses the issue of companies bombarding users with ads and cookie prompts. Many users feel this is an invasion of privacy and a nuisance. Some comments suggest that people should vote with their wallets and stop using these products, while others suggest that regulation is necessary to prevent abusive business practices. One comment thread discusses how Microsoft's bundling deal with computer manufacturers contributes to these practices, and another suggests looking for games on Steam that list Steam Cloud as a feature. Overall, the conversation highlights the need for companies to respect user consent and the importance of consumers being informed and proactive in their choices.No meaningful content to summarize.Windows users express frustration with the amount of pre-installed bloatware and forced consent to services like Microsoft News, with some turning to alternative versions like Windows 10 LTSC and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise to avoid such features. Users also criticize the advertising practices and tracking by Microsoft. Apple users weigh in on similar issues with Apple's advertising practices during setup and other dark patterns. Linux is also praised by users for being fast, powerful, and customizable, with some turning to it as their primary desktop OS despite limitations for gaming.Users discuss the annoyance of Bluetooth headphones opening default media players without their consent, specifically mentioning Bose and Apple devices. Some users suggest workarounds, such as using a macOS app to prevent iTunes or Music from launching or disabling the autoplay feature. Others complain about the intrusion of ads or prompts to sign in to accounts or enable updates on various OS devices. The discussion touches on privacy concerns and dark patterns in Windows 10 settings.Users of Windows and MacOS report frustration with sign-in prompts and notifications about incomplete setups, respectively. Windows users express annoyance at the ubiquity of Microsoft accounts, while MacOS users criticize the OS for its unintuitive UI patterns. The comments section offers recommendations for those looking for alternative operating systems, with Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, and Arch Linux receiving endorsements.Users express their preference for an OS that autoconnects and does not require modifications to system settings or configs. Some express a desire to learn Linux or other languages as part of a queue of interests. Others comment on their experience using Arch or Gentoo distros, or express disinterest in Windows 11 because of ads. Users also discuss the usability of storage size on MacBooks and offer suggestions for alternative laptops that are compatible with Linux.Windows 11 prompts users to sign in with a Microsoft account, adding badges to the Start menu for users logging in with local user accounts; many find it irritating and unnecessary. Some feel that Windows has become nagware, with a UI that makes it difficult to disable real-time antivirus protection The macOS and Linux OS are mentioned as potential alternatives for those who dislike Windows. Bitwig is cited as a viable alternative to Ableton with good Linux support. In some users' opinions, the OS appears cheap with unnecessary, obtrusive changes that tarnish its appearance.- Some users are critical of recent changes to Windows, including the addition of embedded ads and the neglect of feature updates in favor of maintaining market share.\n- Linux operating systems are increasingly seen as superior to Windows for non-gaming purposes due to better UX and performance, with some users recommending Ubuntu and Kubuntu specifically.\n- Graphic cards and multi-monitor support on Linux have improved and may no longer be a barrier to adoption for users seeking an OS for gaming.\n- Companies have been criticized for sacrificing product quality in pursuit of profit, with some users expressing dissatisfaction with hardware and software degradation over time.",

When looking forward, toward the bow of a ship, port and starboard refer to the left and right sides, respectively.In the early days of boating, before ships had rudders on their centerlines, boats were controlled using a steering oar. Most sailors were right handed, so the steering oar was placed over or through the right side of the stern. Sailors began calling the right side the steering side, which soon became \"starboard\" by combining two Old English words: st\u00e9or (meaning \"steer\") and bord (meaning \"the side of a boat\").As the size of boats grew, so did the steering oar, making it much easier to tie a boat up to a dock on the side opposite the oar.

    "hn_content": "The maritime industry's terminology employs \"port\" and \"starboard\" instead of \"left\" and \"right\" to avoid ambiguity, unlike medicine which sticks with the patient's perspective of left and right. Theatrical terminology uses \"stage left/stage right\" to indicate the perspective from an actor facing the audience without disregarding \"left\" or \"right.\" Middle ages created words, like boats, that vary significantly in different romance languages while words from older things tend to have more Latin roots, making them similar across various languages. Many sailing terms have become part of everyday English vernacular. Posh supposedly means \"port out starboard home.\"Comments on a Hacker News thread about nautical origins of common phrases and words used in English. Some examples of nautical terms used in common speech include \"going overboard,\" \"take a different tack,\" \"at the helm,\" and \"change tack.\" Many of these phrases originated from farming and sailing and demonstrate the importance of these industries to civilization. Popular books, such as Master and Commander, Horatio Hornblower, and Return of the Obra Dinn, are recommended for those interested in learning more about naval life and terminology. Doctors use port and starboard to describe patients' left and right sides, respectively, when inside the body.There is a debate regarding the importance of standard image orientation in medical imaging to ensure patient safety in non-standard organ cases. The article discusses various professions' vocabulary that explains complex orientation and location systems. For example, the automotive industry uses 'driver side' and 'passenger side,' while the theatrical world utilizes 'upstage' and 'downstage.' In contrast, the medical industry relies on standard orientations and medical jargon to communicate clearly. Conversely, the article highlights the issues that come with reversed wiper and indicator controls in cars.Drivers discuss the placement of indicator and wiper controls on cars, with many discussing how it differs between countries and even between models of car. Terms like \"off-side\" and \"near-side\" are used to refer to different sides of the car, and there is discussion about how to describe direction when kayaking, and in other fields like theatre, broadcasting and rail. Some comments are more humorous or sarcastic, but the conversation highlights the nuanced differences in language and definitions between countries and professions.Rivers changing direction due to various reasons are not uncommon, with examples like Chicago River and Mississippi reversing flow direction during storm surges. Tonl\u00e9 Sap is an excellent case because during the rainy season, its water level rises, reversing the flow of the river, slowly replenishing Mekong's flow. Various languages use different coordinate systems when describing directions, such as relative, absolute, and intrinsic. Research has shown that language speakers that rely on absolute directions have excellent orientation skills, but it does not necessarily apply to others who grew up with different ways to perceive space.The discussion centers around different terms used in various industries to describe directions, with a focus on nautical terminology. While maritime terminology tends to use port and starboard, other industries utilize different terms, such as climbers or skiers left/right, stage left/right, and more medial/lateral in the medical field. The article also notes the different configurations for red and green lateral marks in nautical usage, and highlights some tricks for remembering the differences. Lastly, the medical profession is noted for using terminology from the patient's perspective to reduce errors.The comments section discusses different ways people deal with the difficulty of distinguishing left from right while driving. Some propose using mnemonics or other tricks to remember left from right, while others use terms like \"my side\" or \"your side\" to avoid confusion. A few commenters bring up the arbitrary nature of directions, while others discuss how sailors and ferry operators handle reversing directions. One commenter mentions how the weakness of force can determine left or right in an antimatter universe.The text is a conversation thread about the direction and lighting of ferry boats, with participants discussing the use of port and starboard instead of left and right. The participants discuss the importance of consistency in naming conventions for navigation, and the fact that the direction of the boat is determined at design time. They also explain the purpose of the red and green lights on ships and mention that boats don't typically travel long distances in reverse. The conversation includes some historical context on the origins of the terms \"port\" and \"starboard.\"The post discusses why sailors use \"port\" and \"starboard\" instead of \"left\" and \"right\" terms to describe directions and coordinates on a ship. Using these terms creates a new set of coordinates relative to the vessel, making it more intuitive and unambiguous. The terms have a historical basis, with \"starboard\" referring to the steering side due to sailors mostly being right-handed, and \"port\" referring to the side that faces the port when docked. Other languages have their own variations, like \"styrbord\" and \"bagbord\" in Danish. Using \"boat left\" or other substitutes would be too long and confusing.",

Many people have fond memories of the DVD service, with some users admitting to burning copies of the DVDs they rented. Others have noted that the service exposed them to a wide range of films and TV shows. The announcement marks the end of an era, with many people mourning the loss of physical disks and the excitement they brought. However, the move is not unexpected, as streaming services have become more popular and physical media has declined in popularity.A user shares an experience of rating over 20,000 movies on Netflix, ending up receiving recommendations in every genre despite expressing no interest. Another user shares their experience of providing feedback to Google for years, requesting no irrelevant or inappropriate ads and finally getting some relief. The comment section also includes a discussion on whether pedestrian buttons change traffic lights, and a nostalgic conversation about piracy involving DVD ripping and burning.Netflix customers reminisce about their experience with the company's former DVD rental service, sharing memories of rushing to rip movies and ship them back, as well as pirating DVDs from Redbox kiosks. There is speculation that the\u00a0end of DVDs could revive small businesses that offered curated DVD collections, but others argue that Redbox will continue to dominate the market. The lost Netflix recommendation system is also discussed; some suggest that the infringement lawsuit that led to its cancellation was due to US privacy laws over video rental records.This post discusses personal stories and memories related to DVD rentals and piracy in the late '90s and early 2000s. Many people used Blockbuster to rent movies and games, and some even hoarded and copied discs. Netflix's DVD rental service had more titles compared to its streaming service, which required negotiating licensing rights. Some people still prefer DVDs or Blu-rays for better quality compared to streaming. The post also includes casual conversations and sarcastic comments about the past entertainment industry.- Netflix's DVD service still has more titles than its streaming service, according to users.\n- Users express sadness over the decreasing back catalog on Netflix due to publishers moving content off to their services.\n- Public libraries and Redbox are suggested alternatives to Netflix for DVDs.\n- Netlfix's social component and queue system is missed by users.\n- Users express that having too many options on streaming services may lead to not finishing films. \n- A discussion about the legality of renting DVDs ensues.A discussion on the legalities of renting DVDs and CDs in the US under the First Sale Doctrine is shared, with some commentators bringing up past cases involving similar startups like Aereo. Netflix's early history as a DVD rental company and its changing relationship with movie studios are also discussed, with studios mostly being fine with supplying Netflix discs as Netflix's pricing model did not impact their profits from home entertainment releases. Redbox's $1 rental kiosks are cited as a significant threat to studios, eventually leading to legal battles over distribution.Netflix has shut down its DVD rental service. The service was launched in 1998 and enabled customers to rent DVDs and Blu-rays. However, it had become a niche operation by 2011, at which time the company considered spinning it off. A spokesperson for Netflix said that DVD rental had \"significantly declined\" due to the \"major decline\" in demand for the format. The news has an impact as it marks the end of an era, as well as\u00a0drawing attention to the company\u2019s shrewd pivot to online streaming services in the late 2000s.\u00a0Netflix's quality for 4K streaming is criticized by users due to compression artifacts and a uniform look across all shows. Apple TV+ has the best quality/bitrate for 4K, while Netflix was allegedly focusing on specifying content delivery requirements and approving equipment rather than providing quality. Piracy is mentioned as providing better service and free access, and libraries are suggested as an alternative source to access a broader selection of films. The discussion also touches on Netflix's successful pivot from DVD shipping to streaming, and its earlier attempt to split its DVD shipping and streaming businesses under two different names.The Tech Times article discusses the end of Netflix's DVD rental service and how it affected users. Some users reminisce about how Netflix was a reliable source for getting hard-to-find movies and TV shows, but it eventually lost its usefulness when it chopped off their long tail. Some users express frustration with the current state of streaming services and prefer owning physical media. The article also delves into issues surrounding DRM and licensing, as well as alternative options for getting movies like buying used DVDs or piracy.The discussion revolves around obtaining movies and TV shows without the hassle of physical storage, with suggestions ranging from streaming services (Netflix and Amazon Prime), libraries, DVDs, Blu-rays, and torrenting, but with concerns over quality and availability. VPN is also mentioned for privacy when torrenting, and private trackers are considered exclusive but difficult to get into. The conversation ends with anecdotes of being unable to find desired titles through streaming subscriptions.Netflix has officially discontinued its DVD-by-mail service, leaving many users without access to the catalog of physical media. Some users express frustration with the limitations of current streaming services and the need to subscribe to multiple platforms to access specific titles. Others lament the loss of the supplemental features, like commentary tracks, that often come with physical media releases. Some users suggest purchasing obscure titles through Amazon or resorting to piracy. Finally, some reflect on Netflix's past plans to spin off its DVD service into a separate company, suggesting that it may have been more viable than previously thought.",

    "content": "Tailscale's third generation plans and pricing will expand the free plan to three users and include usage-based billing for monthly paid plans. The changes aim to reduce friction between 1 user and 2+ users and make the two growth curves the same shape. Tailscale's pricing discontinuities have been smoothed out to minimize friction points. The new pricing plans offer more free nodes and fewer arbitrary limits, and usage-based billing will ensure customers only pay for what they actively use. The update should save money for most customers, and existing annual, custom, and enterprise subscriptions are unaffected.Tailscale, a network security software provider, has switched to usage-based billing for its services, meaning customers only pay for active users rather than a fixed rate for a set number of seats, and don't have to wait for an annual bill.

Existing customers have been assured that their plan is unaffected and can continue to use Personal Pro, but the billing page now offers alternatives. Additionally, the company has adopted a retrospective billing model, meaning that customers are only charged for active users. The move has drawn praise from users, with many applauding the company's transparent approach to pricing and customer service. The service's various use cases have also been highlighted by users.Users discuss their various use cases for Tailscale, a service that provides consistent access to devices regardless of how they reach the internet, and features like key distribution and SSO integration. Use cases include hosting files and services, remote desktop login, testing public IP addresses, sharing print jobs, backup servers, monitoring personal projects, non-tech-savvy family access, and more. The service also allows for easy travel access and networking with some added security features. The simplicity and convenience of using Tailscale over plain vanilla WireGuard are cited multiple times.Tailscale, a zero-trust network platform, is discussed in a Hacker News thread as an easy way to manage the Raspberry Pis used in an IoT project. Tailscale is used to enable consistent IP addresses and internal services in AWS by a company with five members. Various users or commenters have used Tailscale for screen sharing, controlling remote machines, accessing internal servers, local area network (LAN) extension, and ad-blocking. Many users are surprised to find out that they can access Tailscale\u2019s premium features for free. Additionally, several users find Tailscale\u2019s new pricing structure confusing.Tailscale's recent pricing changes now offer a free plan for 3 team members, up to 100 devices, and a monthly paid plan including 3 free users. Users suggest a more affordable pricing tier for personal and family use with moderate user limits, but advanced features. The company is competing with other popular VPN products such as Twingate and NetSkope/ZScaler/Perimeter81s, which offer stronger enterprise features. Tailscale provides simple steps to access home servers from anywhere in the world with a phone. Users debate the security risk of Tailscale's coordination server and consider alternative options like Headscale.Tailscale has announced updates to its Personal and Business plans, with the Personal plan now being called Free and offering almost everything that Tailscale has for up to 3 users and 100 devices. The update includes the removal of hard limits on subnet routers, making IT support with Raspberry Pi easier. Tailscale now also allows users to sign up with any OIDC-compatible identity provider. Some users compare Tailscale unfavorably to ZeroTier, which has no account requirements. However, Tailscale users indicate that the recent updates make it more appealing for personal and professional use.",

She used a \"Worked Out Key\" cipher to encode the messages. She was also the last living female Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent of the forty who worked in France during World War II. Leo Marks is credited with developing new codes for the SOE. Between Silk and Cyanide, the autobiography of the code maker for the SOE, provides details about transmitting codes and the hassle of bruteforcing when somebody misremembered their code or mistransposed. Neal Stephenson's novel The Confusion features a character who codes her letters into her knitting.The comments on this thread are largely focused on discussing the details of how spies used knitting to encode information during wartime, as well as offering related examples of creative uses of steganography in espionage. There is also some discussion around the larger historical context of World War II and how it may eventually be studied as a distant event. While some commenters express confusion or frustration with the article's wording, others provide helpful explanations of the techniques employed by WWII-era spies.The post discusses the significance of World War II and how it will remain a crucial part of human history for centuries to come. The article also touches upon the receding memory of subsequent wars and how they are not as prominent in popular culture. The comment section explores topics such as government transparency, propaganda, and steganography. One comment highlights the story of a female secret operative who sold soap to German soldiers during WWII while transmitting information to the Allied Command through knitting steganography.

Photograph: Roberto La Rosa/AlamyUK newsFrench publisher arrested in London on terrorism chargeErnest Moret was stopped at rail station and taken into custody, where he was questioned about his participation in French protestsMatthew WeaverTue 18 Apr 2023 15.37 EDTFirst published on Tue 18 Apr 2023 09.55 EDTA French publisher has been arrested on terror charges in London after being questioned by UK police about participating in anti-government protests in France.Ernest Moret, 28, a foreign rights manager for \u00c9ditions la Fabrique, was approached by two plainclothes officers at St Pancras station on Monday evening after arriving by train from Paris to attend the London book fair.He was questioned for six hours and then arrested for alleged obstruction in refusing to disclose the passcodes to his phone and computer. His treatment was condemned as an attack on the right to demonstrate, amid calls for protests outside the UK embassy in Paris and the French Institute in London.Moret arrived at St Pancras at 7.15pm with his colleague Stella Magliani-Belkacem, the editorial director at the Paris-based publishing house, to be confronted by the two officers.Magliani-Belkacem told the Guardian: \u201cWhen we were on the platform, two people, a woman and a guy, told us they were counter-terrorist police. They showed a paper called section 7 of the Terrorism Act of 2000 and said they had the right to ask him about demonstrations in France.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019m still shaking. We are in shock about what happened.\u201dShe said French publishers had drafted a joint letter calling for a protest outside the British embassy in France on Tuesday evening about Moret\u2019s treatment.When the officers began questioning Moret, Magliani-Belkacem called her friend Sebastian Budgen, a senior editor at Verso Books in London, at whose home she and Moret had arranged to stay.Budgen arranged for a lawyer to visit Moret. The lawyer called Budgen at 1am on Tuesday to confirm that Moret had been arrested over his refusal to tell police the passcodes to his confiscated phone and laptop. He was transferred to a police station in Islington, north London, where he remained in custody on Tuesday. He was later released on bail.\u00c9ditions la Fabrique is known for publishing radical left authors. Moret also represents the French science fiction novelist Alain Damasio and had arranged more than 40 appointments at the London book fair.A joint press release from Verso Books and \u00c9ditions la Fabrique condemned Moret\u2019s treatment as \u201cscandalous\u201d.It said: \u201cThe police officers claimed that Ernest had participated in demonstrations in France as a justification for this act \u2013 a quite remarkably inappropriate statement for a British police officer to make, and which seems to clearly indicate complicity between French and British authorities on this matter.\u201dIt added: \u201cWe consider these actions to be outrageous and unjustifiable infringements of basic principles of the freedom of expression and an example of the abuse of anti-terrorism laws.\u201dThe statement said a protest was planned at the French Institute in London and called on France\u2019s ambassador to the UK, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duch\u00eane, to request Moret\u2019s immediate release.Budgen said: \u201cIt is causing a stink at the London book fair and there\u2019s a big stink in France as well \u2026 there\u2019s been an increasingly repressive approach by the French government to the demonstrations, both in terms of police violence, but also in terms of a security clampdown.\u201dHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in France last month over Emmanuel Macron\u2019s use of constitutional executive powers to push through an unpopular increase in the pension age. The protests caused King Charles\u2019s planned visit to France, his first overseas tour as monarch, to be postponed.The writers\u2019 association Pen International said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that Moret was detained on counter-terrorism grounds.Pamela Morton, senior books and magazines organiser for the National Union of Journalists, also expressed concern.She said it seemed \u201cextraordinary that the British police have acted this way\u201d in arresting a publisher on the way to the London book fair. \u201cWe will be taking this up with the police,\u201d she added.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: \u201cAt around 7.30pm on Monday 17 April, a 28-year-old man was stopped by ports officers as he arrived at St Pancras station, using powers under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.\u201cOn Tuesday 18 April, the man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of wilfully obstructing a schedule 7 examination, contrary to section 18 of the Terrorism Act 2000.\u201dTopicsUK newsnewsReuse this content",

    "hn_content": "A French publisher was arrested in London for refusing to disclose key encrypted information. UK law makes it a crime to fail to disclose such information, with harsh penalties. The case raises concerns about self-incrimination and the difficulties of proving whether someone remembers a passcode. It also raises worries about the police being granted lifelong access to someone's phone, including potentially sensitive material. The case is especially worrying given the high number of UK police found sharing inappropriate images in recent years.

Some highlights include:\n\n- Commentary on how the UK Labour party is perceived, including comparisons to the US Democrats and historical analysis of its shifting politics.\n- Dialogue on the UK legal system, including unwritten rules and how politicians are selected.\n- Debate on Germany's relations with Russia and the country's political attitudes regarding authoritarianism and technology.\n- Conversation about law enforcement's ability to search a device, including comparing it to searching other types of property and discussions on self-incrimination.A tech news editor summarizes a comment thread regarding a publisher who was ambushed and questioned by the police in France. The thread discusses the use of encryption, encryption laws, and data security amid government surveillance. Several commenters speculate that the UK is becoming a police state with the loss of personal rights, citing examples like the imprisonment of Julian Assange. One commenter suggests using a separate device for passwords if you're not a UK resident.The Tech Times discusses laws surrounding password disclosure in different countries, following the arrest of a publisher in the UK for refusing to divulge passcodes. The article notes that penalties for refusing to surrender passwords vary globally, and also questions the reasons behind the arrest. Some commenters suggested that such laws are a sign of governments' fear of accountability, whilst others mentioned that laws regarding passwords are meant to be a compromise between individuals' privacy and the needs of law enforcement.People debate ways to protect themselves from potential government searches of their electronic devices in the UK; commenters suggest evading through password attempts, passcodes, or crypto tokens, though these methods are not guaranteed to work. \u00a0Some view this as another sign of Western democracies becoming more authoritarian.
