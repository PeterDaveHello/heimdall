    "originBody": "arXiv’s goal is equitable access to scientific research for all – and to achieve this, we have been working to make research papers more accessible for arXiv users with disabilities. We are happy to announce that as of Monday, December 18th, arXiv is now generating an HTML formatted version of all papers submitted in TeX/LaTeX (as long as papers were submitted on or after December 1st, 2023 and HTML conversion is successful – more on this below). HTML is not replacing PDF but will be an additional format available for arXiv users. Submitters will be invited to preview the HTML version of their papers during submission time, the same way they have always done with PDF. When accessing a paper’s abstract page, readers will see a link to view the HTML paper right under the PDF link: The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. HTML formatted papers are more easily and accurately read by screen readers and other technologies, which can assist researchers with reading disabilities, including blindness, low vision, dyslexia, and more. We know that the HTML conversion isn’t perfect yet – right now our HTML is in the “experimental” phase as we work to make conversion more accurate. Currently, not every paper will be able to be correctly converted into HTML. However, researchers with disabilities have told arXiv that HTML is needed *now* for accessibility, and so we wanted to offer that accessibility as quickly as possible, while we continue to work on improving conversions with the help of our community. arXiv will *not* prevent or hold submissions where the HTML conversion has failed, but we do hope that authors will carefully review the HTML version of their submission, as sometimes small changes in the source TeX code can improve the HTML rendering. Experimental HTML is a big step towards making science accessible to all. We want to thank everyone who collaborated on arXiv’s pilot HTML Papers project which includes The LaTeX Project, and the LaTeXML team from NIST. If you are familiar with ar5iv, an arXivLabs collaboration, our HTML offering is essentially bringing this impactful project fully “in-house”. Our ultimate goal is to backfill arXiv’s entire corpus so that every paper will have an HTML version, but for now this feature is reserved for new papers. And a big thank you to all the arXiv users who have taken the time to fill out bug reports for arXiv’s HTML Papers project – our team is currently reading and analyzing the bug reports and hope to make our first round of improvements in the new year.",

Their HTML formatting is also more pleasant than the HTML articles offered by most journals in my field (e.g arXiv HTML footnotes displayed as sidenotes on large displays!) reply jez 14 hours agoprevIt would be neat if they offered submitters the chance to upload their own HTML version alongside the PDF version, instead of always relying on an automatic conversion process.- I can imagine authors feeling frustrated if someone reaches out about a problem in the HTML version of their paper, but they have no way to correct it except by hoping that a change to the PDF fixes a change to the generated HTML. Easier to just fix the formatting problem in the PDF outright.- It would be neat to allow people to experiment with alternative formatting for their papers. For example, imagine a paper about a programming language that embeds a sandbox you can use to play around with the language under discussion. Or a paper about multivariable calculus and you can interact with a three dimensional plot of some function. reply IlliOnato 13 hours agoparentNo, it would not. It&#x27;s critically important that there is only one \"logical\" article, albeit with different representations. In other words, a single \"source of truth\".With \"sideloading\" of HTML there is no way in general to make sure that the contents of LaTeX (and PDF) on one side and HTML on the other side is the same. reply dataflow 9 hours agorootparent> With \"sideloading\" of HTML there is no way in general to make sure that the contents of LaTeX (and PDF) on one side and HTML on the other side is the same.Is it not possible to write LaTeX code that produces different contents in HTML vs. PDF? reply IlliOnato 43 minutes agorootparentWell, perhaps by exploiting bugs&#x2F;shortcomings in PDF and HTML converters. Not by design.However, bugs get fixed, and since the PDF and HTML are generated dynamically, any such hack would be extremely fragile.And while \"single source of truth\" can help to prevent such malicious discrepancy, it&#x27;s unlikely that people would try to hack the system this way: what for?Far more likely scenario is unintentional discrepancy, and single source of truth definitely helps to prevent that! reply diffeomorphism 14 hours agoparentprev> It would be neat if they offered submitters the chance to upload their own HTML version alongside the PDF version, instead of always relying on an automatic conversion process.Please don&#x27;t. Then you will have a mismatch between the source and the \"own html\" which ruins the point of uploading the source. reply eviks 13 hours agorootparentPdf isn&#x27;t the source reply IlliOnato 13 hours agorootparentBut the PDF is also generated. LaTeX is the single source of truth. reply layer8 14 hours agoparentprevThey’d have to define and document a “safe” subset of HTML, and implement a filter&#x2F;checker for it. Otherwise we’d end up with papers containing ads and tracking and XSS vulnerabilities and whatnot. reply digging 13 hours agorootparentThose are issues with JavaScript, not HTML. Wouldn&#x27;t filtering out iframes pretty much keep us in the clear? reply layer8 12 hours agorootparentThe parent wanted interactive 3D plots, which means JavaScript embedded in or linked from the HTML. Then there‘s stuff like JavaScript embedded in SVG. reply CaptainOfCoit 6 hours agorootparentprev> Those are issues with JavaScript, not HTMLWhat about various HTML tags that remote load resources? From script, link, to things like img or CSS `background-image` attribute, added in a `style` attribute.There is a bunch of ways to do remote requests even without HTML. reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentThe same problem exists in HN comments. This comment gets converted to html. But it is fine! reply fdupress 1 hour agorootparent\"gets converted to\" and \"gets rendered as uploaded by the user\" are two different things.There are no issues with arXiv generating the HTML and sending that over: they control the generation process, and users who visit arXiv already trust it to not be malicious. The issue is with letting the user upload their own and having it sent on to other users as is. replykjkjadksj 13 hours agoparentprevMost authors probably have no interest in learning html. Also most authors want nothing to do with the work by the time its submitted. It was probably hell getting the project to that point of publishing, they want to be done with it and move on to the next thing going on in their career asap. reply jez 12 hours agorootparentI think this is an argument in favor of doing automatic PDF -> HTML conversion for the authors that don&#x27;t want to touch it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an argument against letting those who are fine with HTML provide their own. reply IlliOnato 31 minutes agorootparentHTML is not generated from PDF. Both PDF and HTML are generated from LaTeX. reply tiagod 13 hours agoparentprevI was under the impression the source authors publish to arxiv was a latex file reply jez 12 hours agorootparentAh, thanks for clarifying!I looked up the submission formats, and it looks like if you authored the paper in TeX&#x2F;LaTeX, they do not accept pre-rendered versions of the document.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.arxiv.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;submit&#x2F;index.html#formats-for-te...But if you did not author it in TeX&#x2F;LaTeX (e.g., Word, Google Docs, etc.) it appears you can upload a PDF or HTML yourself. reply IlliOnato 24 minutes agorootparentBut it&#x27;s still a single source of truth. Only one document is submitted. So for works submitted as HTML no PDF or LaTeX version is available. reply jraph 13 hours agorootparentprevIt is. reply thomasahle 12 hours agoparentprev> It would be neat if they offered submitters the chance to upload their own HTML version alongside the PDF version, instead of always relying on an automatic conversion process.Can you recommend a system I can use to compile my latex, while also making sure the html is going to look good? I&#x27;d like some kinds of css style @media queries to switch between certain parts of the layout, while keeping a single latex file. reply svag 13 hours agoprevThe tool that it&#x27;s being used for this offering is this one, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arXiv&#x2F;arxiv-readability, just to save a few clicks :) reply ofou 1 hour agoparentI wonder how better is this compared to Pandoc&#x27;s reply IshKebab 11 hours agoparentprevWow I did not know they have the LaTeX for all the papers and compile it themselves! That&#x27;s pretty crazy. What if they don&#x27;t have packages you need? What if your paper isn&#x27;t written with LaTeX? reply r4indeer 3 hours agorootparent> What if they don&#x27;t have packages you need?Unlikely.

This is significantly better than what publishers offer (usually a really old latex version, not even pdflatex). reply jll29 12 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s a cool feature because it makes the papers more finable, more easily navigatable, easier to read online and faster to scroll through. I am also happy for blind people that they can more easily use ArXive with Braille readers now.(I&#x27;m still a fan of printing the PDFs, because I annotate on paper and refer to page numbers, but the HTML feature is in addition to PDF download, not a replacement.)One thing that still sucks (not ArXiv related though) is reading mathematical formulae on the Kindle - wonder if someone with rendering expertise could have a look into the MOBI format. reply isaacfung 4 hours agoparentThis would never happen but in an ideal world, we should be able to click on a citation to jump to the part of the paper that is being referenced and each paper page should have a discussion board so we can easily communicate with the authors and group the discussion in one place instead of us having to google to see if there is relevant discussion on twitter&#x2F;reddit. We can even put links to talks, tutorials, blogs, github repo, demo, paperswithcode&#x2F;google scholar&#x2F;open review, background material, a timeline of citations in tree form on the same page(actually I am seeing more machine learning papers that have a project page that does some of these) or even turn it into a mini wiki. I just think html has so much more potential(especially now with LLM we can do semantic search). I wonder if there would be interest in such a chrom extension overlay.Related projects:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyekhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arxiv-vanity&#x2F;engrafohttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dginev&#x2F;ar5ivhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;academ.us&#x2F;article&#x2F;2111.15588&#x2F; (powered by https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jgm&#x2F;pandoc I believe) reply me_jumper 3 hours agorootparentI think https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.hypothes.is&#x2F; would be of interest to you. reply tarboreus 14 hours agoprevOne of the reasons is to make the papers more accessible to people with disabilities, especially the blind. I participated in a conference they hosted on this a few months ago, I recommend taking a look at the recordings if you&#x27;re interested in thinking on this.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accessibility2023.arxiv.org&#x2F; reply miki123211 14 hours agoparentBlind person here, can confirm this. Reading PDFs with a screen reader is bad, reading PDFs that come from LaTeX is worse, reading LaTeX math is pretty much impossible. All the semantic info you need is just thrown away.You can make decently accessible PDFs but it&#x27;s lots of work, you need Acrobat on the producer&#x27; side and might also need it on the consumer&#x27;s side. Free tools don&#x27;t even come close. There&#x27;s also the fact that the process of making accessible PDFs in Acrobat isn&#x27;t itself accessible.With that said, the way screen readers treat HTML math certainly isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s geared more towards school children than anything above calculus. I&#x27;m probably going to stay with my LaTeX source files for now. At least ArXiv offers those, not many sites do. To be fair, that approach also has its own set of problems (particularly when people use some extra fancy formatting in their math equations, making the markup hard to read), but I find this to be the best approach for me so far, at least on AI&#x2F;ML papers. reply kkylin 6 hours agorootparentI teach math at a university. A couple years ago I had two blind students in my section of first-year calculus, and I really struggled with the tooling. Using latexml, I could produce documents that one of the students could use with a screen reader, but the other student never managed to make it work on their machine. Both students prefer braille but I didn&#x27;t find anything open source that could typeset mathematical braille easily. Our disability resource office sends things out to a contractor to typeset into braille; the turn-around is measured in weeks.Anyway, if you (or anyone else reading this) has suggestions I&#x27;d really appreciate it! reply Saigonautica 2 hours agorootparentInteresting! I never thought about this, thank you for sharing.What kind of turn-around time would be practical? Could you point me to any typeset mathematical braille that would be an example of a solution to your problem? Is Nemeth the only important standard, or are others important for you too?I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s practical to set this up as back-office work here in Vietnam. There are some outlying provinces here where there are very few job opportunities. Job opportunities for the blind also round down to zero here (e.g. I could hire for proofreading). Maybe there&#x27;s room to do something cool here. reply lostlogin 5 hours agorootparentprev> Our disability resource office sends things out to a contractor to typeset into braille; the turn-around is measured in weeks.This seems a massive gap in the market - many institutions have funding earmarked for such things. reply hedora 4 hours agorootparentI wonder if this is a useful service that an llm could actually outperform humans on. reply ldenoue 12 hours agorootparentprevI wrote an app called PDF Reflow that reflows the original PDF using image processing to cut out words into tiles so you see the reflowed version of the text in their original look.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appblit.com&#x2F;pdfreflow reply sydbarrett74 8 hours agorootparentAny chance of releasing an Android version? reply IlliOnato 16 minutes agorootparent+1 reply hedora 4 hours agorootparentprevGv (part of ghostscript) used to do a good job of this for two column documents. When zoomed in to show one column width of text, the spacebar ran through the top of column 1, then the bottom of column 1, then the top of column 2 and so on.The amount it scrolled probably depended on the aspect ratio of the window, so it might be multiple key presses to scroll an entire column. reply ldenoue 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s using web technologies so yes it could also be on Android. I’ll see what can be done. reply no_identd 4 hours agorootparentprev+1 reply ahepp 10 hours agorootparentprevDo you think there&#x27;s potential for language models to play a role here? I know that AI can get tossed around as a buzzword, but hasn&#x27;t it proved quite successful in fields like computer vision?I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with the state of that art, but it seems like recovering the metadata from a PDF generated by LaTeX would be no more impressive than many other things we&#x27;re currently seeing language models achieve? reply staunton 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m absolutely positive a few million dollars could get you a system that can \"read aloud\" pdf math papers in no time. I guess people will wait for it to become cheaper though. reply hutzlibu 9 hours agorootparentYou can also have that cheaper already. But having it stable and reliable - will take some time and possibly more money, depending on your definition of reliable. reply throwaway287391 9 hours agorootparentprevYou wouldn&#x27;t need to use computer vision on a picture of the PDF. arXiv has the tex source for most of the papers. An LLM trained on code could do a pretty good job of translating tex to readable html with a bit of effort. reply phlakaton 8 hours agorootparentprevFor the math equations, I&#x27;m curious: does MathML do any better for you than LaTeX? reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentNot the person you’re asking the question to, but it’s worth noting (if you don’t already know) that MathML is really not designed at all as an input language for practitioners who just want to write a few equations in some document. It’s designed as an output&#x2F;presentation language so that devices that want to render some maths can do so faithfully[1]. As such, if you’re a human being who wants to typeset some equation, you’ll want to go to latex every single time rather than mathml and then someone else has to figure out the conversion.[1] Great explanation here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;57717&#x2F;relationship-b... reply IlliOnato 12 minutes agorootparentOn the other hand, \"semantic\" flavor of MathML (as opposed to \"presentation\") is much easier than TeX for things like screen readers, both conceptually and in practice. reply Blikkentrekker 9 hours agorootparentprevI made these arguments two decades ago when I was still in university that PDF is a horrible format because it&#x27;s purely præsentational, especially for people with disabilities whose software relies on semantic information. LaTeX last time I used it didn&#x27;t even have a different symbol for uppercase Alpha and A because the glyphs are indistinguishable.They argued that PDF was superior because the publisher could control how it looked and it looked the same everywhere but the point is that it should not. Things such as font size and line spacing should be at the control of the consumer, not the publisher. This isn&#x27;t simply blind people but for instance also persons with dyslexia who use particular fonts to make it easier to read for them. Or in my case, someone who simply gets a headache from fronts and line-spacing that is too big. I&#x27;ve also been using darkmode everywhere for so long now that reading black text on a white surface on a screen gives me a headache. reply IlliOnato 7 minutes agorootparentFor scientific articles pagination is still important, because it&#x27;s how you refer to a particular part of a paper. If things like font size and line spacing are at the control of the consumer, pagination is not preserved.This problem is harder than you one would think naively. reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentprevTo write uppercase Alpha you need a modern version of latex (ie xelatex or lualatex) and to include the unicode-math packagehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;485593&#x2F;how-to-write-... reply spookie 9 hours agorootparentprevYup LaTeX math doesn&#x27;t make sense. I&#x27;ve been trying to hack my way into getting a voice model to read it but no real progress. reply saurik 13 hours agorootparentprevHuh. It would seem like, of all the things which should make it easy to generate the correct accessibility information, the pipeline of compiling a paper from source code in LaTeX should nail it... maybe we should all pitch in to some pool to pay someone to put in the required effort to connect all the dots? reply jahewson 10 hours agorootparentSurprisingly it’s not easy, and depending on the field it can be quite challenging. The reason for this is that TeX captures the visual aspects of typesetting, not the semantic meaning of the mathematics.A simple example is ‘\\sum’ which provides no way to capture the expression being summed over - because that’s not necessary for typesetting. That’s not the case in, say, MathML.Writing MathML is no fun though because mathematical formulae are visually ambiguous and we rely on the context to know how to read them, e.g. does ‘f(x - 1)’ mean function f called with argument x - 1, or does it mean variable f multiplied by x - 1? reply semi-extrinsic 11 hours agorootparentprevKind of tangential, but it&#x27;s also kind of surprising how difficult it is in LaTeX to make a plot of an equation.Say I have Equation \\ref{eq}. Why can&#x27;t I just say \"plot \\ref{eq} for x from -6 to 11\" and get my graph?And yes, I know about pgfplots, PSTricks, TikZ etc. But in all those cases, I need to define the same equation twice, in different syntax to boot. It&#x27;s kind of unsatisfying. reply fsh 3 hours agorootparentTeX is a very arcane language, and it doesn&#x27;t support floating point numbers. Few languages would be less suited for making a plotting library. reply jakderrida 12 hours agorootparentprevHold on... Are you telling me that all these complex sentences are being typed out based on your voice alone? That&#x27;s insane. reply topato 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d say it would be simple to talk type these using windows 11&#x27;s redux of voice typing. Pretty damn accurate and easy to modify&#x2F;variate text&#x2F;options. I use it all the time to make tech&#x2F;engineering blog posts, faster and more organic than typing, typically, and it learns your technoacronyms. Combined with voice access, it makes it trivial to fully operate your computer (well, at least, browse the web, email, and media apps) from across the room. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried the updated version, highly suggest hitting windowskey+h and giving it a shot. reply kzrdude 12 hours agorootparentprevHm tangential question but shouldn&#x27;t touch typing be well accessible for many blind computer users? reply ehPReth 12 hours agorootparentprev? blind people can use keyboards reply spookie 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are braille keyboards too reply Blikkentrekker 9 hours agorootparentOr normal keyboards? Many people can type blind. Some learned to do so while born blind, others became blind after they had already learned this skill.I would assume that the majority of persons on HN are not looking at their keyboard as they type. reply spookie 7 hours agorootparentI was just giving an additional way to use a computer not known by many.

I&#x27;m much more likely to read the html version; that PDF is deeply off-putting in some hard to define way. Maybe it&#x27;s the two columns, or the font, or the fact that the format doesn&#x27;t adjust to fit different screen sizes. reply tobias2014 14 hours agorootparentThis is very interesting, because for me it&#x27;s just the opposite. In particular the two column layout is just more readable and approachable for me. The PDF version also allows for a presentation just as the authors intended. I guess it&#x27;s good that they offer both now. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentDo you work extensively with LaTeX?Two columns is good, albeit annoying on mobile. But the font. The typeface kills me, and almost every LaTeX-generated document sports it. reply saurik 13 hours agorootparentHilariously, I would probably tolerate the HTML version a lot better if it had the font from the PDF (and FWIW, the answer for me is \"no: I don&#x27;t work with LaTeX at all...

Authors probably sent a double spaced word document with figures and tables on another file. reply z2h-a6n 13 hours agorootparentNot on arXiv (unless I&#x27;m much mistaken), which is a preprint server, not a conventional journal.arXiv accepts various flavors of TeX, or PDFs not produced by TeX [0], and automatically produces PDFs and HTML where possible (e.g. if TeX is submitted). In the case of the example paper under discussion, the authors submitted TeX with PDF figures [1], and the PDF version of the paper was produced by arXiv. The formatting was mainly set by using REVTeX, which is a set of macros for LaTeX intended for American Physical Society journals.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.arxiv.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;submit&#x2F;index.html#formats-for-te...

Richard Stevens (RIP, still hurts) famously used troff for his books. reply cozzyd 12 hours agorootparentprevYou typically send a .tar.gz of tex files (and, figures, .bbl, etc.) to the journal. And then you typically upload something very similar to the arxiv (I have an arxivify Makefile target for for my papers that handles some arxiv idiosyncrasies like requiring all figures to be in the same folder as the .tex file, and it also clears all the comments; sometimes you can find amusing things in source file comments for some papers).Some fields may use Word files, but in most of physics you would get laughed at...It is true that most journals will typically reformat your .tex in a different way than is displayed on the arXiv. reply tonyg 13 hours agorootparentprevIn computer science, the usual case is that the author fully formats the paper. reply aragilar 3 hours agorootparentprevNot only is this wrong about physics&#x2F;astronomy, I regularly use the arxiv version because the typography is better (e.g. in the published paper an equation is split with part of the equation being at the bottom of one column, and the top of the next, whereas the equation is on one line in the arxiv version). reply frocmlol 13 hours agorootparentprevYou are very confidently wrong.In the arxiv you use latex and do everything yourself. There is no editor. reply eigenket 11 hours agorootparentprevYou are completely wrong. ArXiv doesn&#x27;t work like that. reply z2h-a6n 13 hours agorootparentprevFor what it&#x27;s worth, two column layouts are very common in the physical sciences, or at least in physics which I&#x27;m more familliar with. I have a feeling that the reason is at least partly to save page space when using displayed math (e.g. equations that are formatted in a break between blocks of text), which use the full text width (i.e. the width of one column) to display what may be much less than half a page wide. reply FredPret 13 hours agorootparentIt makes sense - for paper. But pixels are infinite - HTML is far better for screen display, which is how people read things nowadays.The extra column next to the one I&#x27;m reading introduces a lot of visual noise, and the content is hard enough as it is. I&#x27;m sure physicists have all gotten used to it, but it certainly trips me up. reply nyssos 12 hours agorootparent> The extra column next to the one I&#x27;m reading introduces a lot of visual noisePapers are generally not read start to finish in one go: there&#x27;s lots of rereading and jumping back and forth between key parts, and anything that moves them further apart makes this harder. reply FredPret 12 hours agorootparentAh, that makes more sense. I imagined scientists just reading the whole thing start-to-finish.I still think a flexible layout is best. If you like multi-columns and have a wide screen, why not display 12 columns next to each other?With PDF this is not possible.

A ipad or computer have much wider screen width. One column layout is too wide for them for average people to scan text lines quickly.While it looks perfectly fine on a phone. Two columns layout looks terrible on a smartphone, the text is too tiny to read comfortably.It would probably be even better if you can flip it left and right like a ebook instead of scrolling to allocate the content faster. But current design is good enough IMO. (Compare to reading a pdf on cellphone) reply GoblinSlayer 1 hour agorootparentTo display two column layout you need a tall screen, now wide.

I can annotate it on the side both in print and digitally with my iPad. I can also invert colors in pdf readers to get some kind of “dark mode” easily.The html version is wasting a lot of space on the right side and the color scheme is awful (dark grey on a brown background, seriously? How is that any better? Edit: disabling dark mode yields a better reading experience wrt color scheme). Also, somehow links to references make another http request and have no backlink?The html version could make sense if it had more dynamic functionalities: change fonts&#x2F;line spacing, toggle color schemes, maybe a mini map or some other navigational tool?

Even when I&#x27;m on a computer, I still prefer to read PDFs. reply creatonez 2 hours agoparentThere is a taste component to it of course, but the history of PDF shows that it&#x27;s the wrong format for reading on a computer. It was originally meant to be the end result of a publishing process before printing, a layer that sits right between the publishing software and the postscript that gets sent to the printer. This makes the PDF format quite inflexible for reading on a computer, with it being impossible to properly zoom or adjust the reading experience.Unfortunately many institutions and businesses have ignored its limitation because PDF turned out to be an obvious-but-naive to put a &#x27;sheets of paper&#x27; metaphor into a computer system, which in the 1990s appealed to tech illiterate folks doing bare-bones computerization of existing paper systems. So later we got complicated and error-prone tools for editing PDFs, and many random additions to the spec to allow for unusual use cases. reply aragilar 1 hour agoparentprevI know of no-one who provides only HTML to arxiv, it&#x27;s either latex, or doc&#x2F;odt, so the PDFs should always be there. reply reqo 14 hours agoprevA lot of AI&#x2F;ML papers these days have an accompanying interactive page like [0], will we see anything like these now directly in arXive?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voyager.minedojo.org&#x2F; reply z2h-a6n 13 hours agoparentI think then arXiv would have to deal with mantaining the tech stack and providing the presumably much higher server capacity to serve the more varied web pages that would result, so it seems like a tall order. arXiv already has an experimental integration with Papers with Code [0], which I guess provides similar results for the reader, though the authors have to figure out their own web hosting.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.arxiv.org&#x2F;labs&#x2F;showcase.html#arxiv-links-to-cod... reply shusaku 15 hours agoprevSeems like the references aren’t working very well.I really want journals to have two way links in a paper.

For example, I parse text a lot faster if I use a regex to split each paragraph into sentences and place a linebreak after each sentence, or if I do natural language \"syntax highlighting\" by assigning a distinctive color to functional words indicating logical structure like &#x27;if&#x2F;then&#x27;, &#x27;and&#x27;, &#x27;or&#x27;, &#x27;not&#x27;, &#x27;because&#x27;, and &#x27;is&#x27;. And sometimes it really improves readability to be able to do \"semantic highlighting\", in the sense of say assigning a different hashed color to each proper name (or each labeled thesis, etc) that occurs in the paper.

When developing information for the web, agencies should default to creating and publishing content in an HTML format in lieu of publishing content in other electronic document formats that are designed for printing or preserving and protecting the content and layout of the document (e.g., PDF and DOCX formats).

Unfortunately, they aren&#x27;t.On the browser side, supporting all-in-one html files can be as simple a reading a single multipart-encoded page. Heck, if they support automatically serializing all external resources as datauris when saving pages, then most browsers will be able to open them without any modification.On the OS side, operating systems can treat html files as first class citizens; execute them in an offline sandbox (most operating systems have embedded webviews), then extract icon, title, description and other metadata to present to the user. An icon the consists of a blank page with a small browser icon in the corner doesn&#x27;t tell me anything about what the page is about. This needs to change.In short, html can be easily made nicer to deal with locally thanks to all the parts already being in place.

HTML files are readable on basically every platform, even moreso because they are fundamentally text files (unlike PDFs, which are binaries).

The ability to save and annotate pdfs is not an inherent feature of the file format, they exist because the format is such a PITA to interact with that specialized programs have to be written.

The same is true for bug reports: if you always approach any bug report with the possibility that it may be your mistake, 1) you avoid annoying someone if it is your mistake, and might actually get helpful advice, and 2) you&#x27;re more likely to get a cordial reception for real bugs.You don&#x27;t have to be excessively self-effacing about it, just avoid presenting things as though the project you&#x27;re reporting it to being at fault is the only possible conclusion. reply steve_adams_86 12 hours agorootparentprevI do something similar.

A better solution would be a trunk with PVID on the naughty VLAN and tagged v100. I chose the former to make it stand out.The naughty VLAN thing is similar to a discard VLAN but the traffic is not discarded but instead gets logged. We should never see traffic on the naughty VLAN. If we do its a miss-configuration or something nasty.As well as that, we have customers for whom Chrimbo is anything up to 50% of annual turnover.

It&#x27;s not that crazy to want to dodge the whole mad rush and take lots of time off later in the year when it&#x27;s actually nice outside. Summer vacation beats winter vacation, so if you have to take days off in the winter there&#x27;s pressure to try and get somewhere warm where the days are longer. Besides. The \"office\" is quiet, even if you&#x27;re a telecommuter, so it&#x27;s easy to get things done. If you&#x27;re not touching production, that&#x27;s fine, there&#x27;s usually all kinds of fun or quality-of-life projects around tech debt, tooling, whatever.

There was no good reason to push it out now other than that, and there were several reasons not to, such as it wasn’t well tested and it’s fucking December 20th.

Several years ago I spent an entire Christmas vacation, including all day Christmas Day, putting out fires because a team couldn&#x27;t be bothered to do five minutes of cursory load testing. As a consequence, multiple production systems went down under load.Later, after we regrouped after a month of this brutality, they wandered around the office bragging like they&#x27;d hung the fucking moon after they fixed the crippling, obvious design issue they&#x27;d released. I confronted the dev lead with the fact that they would have seen this after 30s of load testing and he just laughed, I think he literally said \"LOL\".

Don’t do it because you want people to grind until Dec 24th at 6 pm. Do it because it’s great the rest of the year, too. I’d recommend you look into (or ask me about) feature flags, alerting, and automated roll-backs.The short version is: there’s a meta-system on top of your release process that can tell (if you are using roll-back not features flags): - commits until xyzsdf are fine; - roll-outs starting from commit abcdef have a 2% error rate, 80% on Android; - revert to xyzsdf, send a message (low-priority, email) to the DevOps on call and the author of abcdef that it happened; - for all commits after abcdef: if there no conflicts with xyzsdf, re-try to roll them out; - if there is a conflict because they were on top or abcdef, send a message (low-priority email) to the authors that there is a conflict.There are more sophisticated versions that can do things like, if you use feature flags, flagging Android users to use the previous version. Another way to do this is to scale who has access to abcdef gradually: say 1% every hour, and revert if you detect issues.All those seem daunting to teams that haven’t worked like this before, but it my experience, they love it very fast. reply tetha 12 hours agorootparentWe use these systems liberally on other times of the year and no one notices, usually. If they do, downtime and interruption budgets handle this.&#x2F;However&#x2F;, let me counter with the point: Just one of our customer has 8000 FTEs working with our system. During hell-time (aka, December and Christmas shopping and shipping), each of those dudes spends their shift taking customer calls lasting 2-4 minutes, which in turn require a few requests into our systems.Due to the stress of their customers^2 (because it&#x27;s Christmas and holidays and such), if an agent of a customer is unable to access our systems, they cannot handle the use case of the customer^2 and that will piss of the customer of the customer.So if we push a bad change during this time, we&#x27;re going to piss of hundreds of customers^2 per minute for that one customer alone. Even with a fast automatic rollback, that&#x27;s a long time during hell-time. And they have people who know how to yell at vendors in nasty ways who don&#x27;t like that.I enjoy moving software fast and enabling moving software quickly, but customer focus and customer orientation means to understand when to move slow as well.And hey, if that means more quiet holidays for the hard working operators on my team, who&#x27;s gonna complain? reply bertil 11 hours agorootparentYou are a lot more ahead than most companies.I’ve worked for too many places where the Christmas break was because of a lack of tooling. I’m glad you are two steps ahead. reply pinkgolem 10 hours agorootparentprevAs the person before mentioned, partial rollouts with separate monitoring would help with that and might be an improvement the other 11 month..But we are doing the same thing, 2 weeks around Christmas there is please take holidays if you can period where we do not merge any non priority one tickets.. which has not happened yet. reply yardstick 13 hours agorootparentprevHow do you detect errors like this?What is an error? Is a business logic bug going to be picked up by this process automatically, or is some manual steps involved?Ie a point of sale app releases an update that automatically halves the amount to charge, but displays the full amount to the merchant in the UI. Unit tests pass (because an engineer made a human mistake). Backend calls are correctly used, no errors thrown, simply the wrong amount is used.How would this be automatically detected and reverted?Would anyone writing point of sale software want to risk this over one of the biggest trading periods of the year? reply bertil 11 hours agorootparentAs you point out, it really depends on what is an error. Most of the companies I know of have a Holiday freeze are video games, casual ones, even. Changes are minor fixes and optimization—glitches that a player likely won’t notice, but you want to detect them early to avoid losing your ability to detect more.Back-end tools are different, and I definitely see reasons other than bugs to not change business logic this month. reply codebolt 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that model may work for many public facing apps, but probably less so for enterprise systems that are heavy in business logic. reply roughly 10 hours agorootparentprev> it also betrays that your system is brittle and can be broken by a bad commit.Correct.

I understand that it&#x27;s a necessary part of the job to fix issues that occur during my shift, so I don&#x27;t really mind it, but it gives me long term issues. I feel anxious whenever I don&#x27;t have my phone on me, or when I&#x27;m far enough into the wilderness to lose my cell signal. Late night when I don&#x27;t expect to be getting messages from anyone, a random notification can sometimes give me an immediate stomach-drop panic response.Unfortunately I feel like I lucked into this role and if I left I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find anything anywhere near as good. reply crossroadsguy 8 hours agoparentprevAnd I am not even sure whether you are talking about just day-time on-call or the 24 hours on-call for at least 1 full week to two week stretches or a simple 12 hours on-call you are talking about? In India the Indian managers (and American managers are just fine with it) have made an environment of this barbaric practice of 24x7 on-call handled by just one person.In fact, even when there are US&#x2F;western counterparts these subhumans projects that they will make sure Indian engineers are on-call even during American daytime. This has been happening at my workplace. They employ all tactics - from fear, intimidation, to try to sweat talk engineers into it with shit like, \"Oh, we own it, right? So it&#x27;s our responsibly to support even when it&#x27;s night\".With that environment it becomes extremely difficult and a pressurised situation for someone like me who simply refuse to even sign up on something like PagerDuty and make it clear that my phone remains silenced and out of my bedroom between 10pm-7am and it really does.I agree with you - there is no amount of money that can put on on-call, definitely not on a night shift on-call. reply tdeck 1 hour agorootparent> have made an environment of this barbaric practice of 24x7 on-call handled by just one person.If it makes you feel any better this is very common in small to mid-sized US tech companies as well. In every team I&#x27;ve been on that had an oncall rotation it was a full week 24&#x2F;7 per person, that rotated among team members. Even at Google we were on call for our own service overnight and didn&#x27;t have SRE &#x2F; other time zone oncalls.But the number of pages and other work varied significantly between teams. The worst was risk at Square in 2016, where we routinely got paged 40+ times a week (mostly noise) and when real incidents were most likely on Saturday morning. The best was Instant Apps at Google where we got a ~$5k bonus for each week of overnight oncall and almost never got a single page. reply dkjaudyeqooe 6 hours agoparentprevWith the last (and only) job that required me to be on call I quit the day before I was scheduled.

    "title": "Apple's HotspotHelper API Enables Location Tracking Without User Consent for Almost a Decade",
    "originLink": "https://wingu.se/2023/11/30/only-apple-can-do-allow-apps-tracking-users-location-without-consensus.html",
    "originBody": "Apple allows applications to track user locations without authorization Nov 30, 2023 中文在英文文末 Apple asserts itself as a champion of user privacy; however, this claim will be proven untrue in this article. For almost a decade, Apple allowed apps had the capability to track users’ locations without affording them the option to disable this feature or even raising awareness about it. And this is “ONLY APPLE CAN DO”! The HotspotHelper API in Action Since the introduction of iOS 9 in 2015, Apple has included an API call named “HotspotHelper,” enabling developers to request a capability for their apps to assist the system in connecting to WiFi access points. Let’s delve into how this API works with a simplified code snippet: import CoreLocation import NetworkExtension class LocationTrackingManager { func setupHotspotHelper() { // Request HotspotHelper capability NEHotspotHelper.register(options: nil, queue: DispatchQueue.main) { (command) in if let networkList = command.networkList { for network in networkList { // Access WiFi network information (SSID, MAC address) // see: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nehotspotnetwork let ssid = network.ssid let macAddress = network.bssid// Perform location tracking logic with ssid and macAddress self.trackLocation(withSSID: ssid, andMACAddress: macAddress) } } } } func trackLocation(withSSID ssid: String, andMACAddress macAddress: String) { // Your location tracking logic goes here // Use the ssid and macAddress to determine user location } } This snippet demonstrates how developers can utilize the HotspotHelper API to register for WiFi network information. The trackLocation method showcases the potential for extracting data that can be used for location tracking. The Privacy Dilemma The real cause for concern arises from the fact that, with access to such information, apps can effectively track a user’s location. This is based on the premise that most WiFi access points remain stationary after deployment, providing a consistent reference for triangulating a user’s whereabouts. Public API avalible such as Precisely Location By Wi-fi Access Point, Google’s Geolocation API. While the intentions behind HotspotHelper may be rooted in facilitating seamless connectivity, the unintended consequence of potential location tracking without explicit user consent raises eyebrows in the ongoing privacy debate. This capability is activated whenever the user’s device scans nearby WiFi access points, extending beyond explicit user engagement with the system settings to include instances where the device is locked in someone’s pocket. The system will initiate the registered app with this API, enabling the app to retrieve nearby SSIDs and their MAC addresses and transmit this information to the server side. Consequently, if the app developer wishes, they possess the capability to nearly real-time track the user’s location. Importantly, users remain unaware of this process occurring on their screens, and they lack the option to disable it. On the other hand, almost all the users doesn’t know the App has this feature and they don’t need/use this feature to help their lives. But again, they have no choice, their devices has to launch the App and submit near by WiFi info to the developers of the App. Global Impact: WeChat and Alipay Adding another layer to the discussion is the fact that major apps like WeChat and Alipay have already implemented this capability. These two apps are ubiquitous in mainland China, touching almost every aspect of people’s lives. The widespread use of these applications in a densely populated region intensifies the implications of location tracking without user consent. A compelling debate could center around whether WeChat and/or Alipay function as responsible citizens in the app world, asserting that their data collection aims solely at enhancing user experience and facilitating seamless connections to nearby WiFi. Nevertheless, the opaque server-side logic embedded in their code raises questions. Could it be that once again, “ONLY APPLE CAN DO” in terms of ensuring transparency and accountability? Apple’s “response” In reality, I discovered this issue approximately two years ago and created a video on Bilibili (a Chinese alternative to YouTube) discussing the matter. However, it has only very limited public awareness. I also brought this concern to Apple’s attention and received an email response, but as of now, there has been no further update on the matter. Conclusions I strongly advocate for Apple to offer users the option to disable this feature, akin to other privacy settings such as location and notifications. Apps should explicitly seek permission before accessing this feature, ensuring users have the ability to grant or deny access while using the app. As the conversation around digital privacy continues to evolve, Apple finds itself navigating the fine line between innovation and safeguarding user data. The question remains: can Apple maintain its commitment to privacy while addressing concerns raised by the HotspotHelper feature? Only time will tell how this controversial aspect fits into Apple’s broader privacy narrative.

There are both technical and business restrictions that prevent it from being used for other tasks, such as accessory integration or Wi-Fi based location. Before using NEHotspotHelper, you must first be granted a special entitlement (com.apple.developer.networking.HotspotHelper) by Apple.Which makes sense, but then why exactly are apps like WeChat and Alipay granted this entitlement? reply n2d4 17 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t know about Alipay, but afaict WeChat needs this feature for WeChat Wifi, which lets users connect to internet hotspots from their WeChat accounts https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mp.weixin.qq.com&#x2F;s?__biz=MzI1NjA0NzQzOQ==&mid=265026... reply smith7018 16 hours agorootparentI’m sure that’s valid but I’ve worked for mobile app companies and can guarantee features like this are added just to get the entitlement. reply r00fus 16 hours agorootparentAh now I see - to get all the entitlements they create a super-app that happens to use those things.Then they can spy on us for our main use case reply ccorcos 14 hours agorootparentSeems like Apple should give users the ability to download an app while rejecting an entitlement. reply Analemma_ 14 hours agorootparentYou can. iOS apps have to request individual permissions - I&#x27;m not sure about the specific level of granularity here, but you can deny location access while still letting the rest of the app run, and the app has to be able to deal with it. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentNo, you can reject permissions, but not entitlements.Entitlements are granted (statically, per developer certificate or maybe app ID, not sure) by Apple, permissions are (optionally) granted by users at runtime.The only way to not have an app making use of an API gated by (only) an entitlement is to never install it.Of course there could be permissions that are gated behind entitlements, but in this case it seems to be only an entitlement. reply sunnybeetroot 10 hours agorootparentAnd even then, an app can block usage until you allow a permission; ie Snapchat doesn’t need the camera permission to allow you to chat but will block usage of the app until you enable it. reply diebeforei485 13 hours agorootparentprevAs I understand it, this SSID feature does not require location services permissions. reply ghostpepper 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not a new idea but I would love to see Apple implement a way to serve eg. a fake, empty contact list for an app that refuses to enable a feature unless you allow contact list permissions. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentprevI at least partially blame Apple for this too.I personally use several different terminal&#x2F;Unix emulator&#x2F;SSH client apps on iOS that request the \"background location\" permission solely because there is no actual \"background execution\" API. reply samstave 16 hours agorootparentprevThe complexities and capabilities in the Chinese(well, most asia) mobile market are remarkable.I always find it funny when people boast about how great certain things are in the US without ever have traveled to HK, Singapore, Tokyo, Beijing etc...Most people dont realize just how entangled mobile life is in Asia, way more than in the US. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentCentralized superapps seem incredibly dangerous to privacy, given that the limited mobile privacy models are designed around per-app permissions. 1. Create app that does 1 thing 2. Add more features to app 3. Abuse superset of permissions 4. Gov leans on app owner 5. Gov abuses superset of permissions reply Analemma_ 14 hours agorootparentI think if you&#x27;re in China the centralized superapp is the least of your worries, privacy-wise. I agree that this is probably part of why these things will never really take off in the US though (no matter what Elon wants to wish for). reply philistine 13 hours agorootparentIt is not the least of your worries, it is the abusive system working as intended. It is policy of the Chinese state to ingratiate itself into every aspect of its citizens&#x27; lives to exert control.The fact the State is wholly evil in other ways does not lessen the worry; it multiplies it. reply samstave 15 hours agorootparentprevNo, I more than 100% agree, I am just staing that most people just dont realize just how deeply entangled the mobile is to Asian life. I wasn&#x27;t praising it, I am horrified, but also in awe by it. reply gman83 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure most people are very aware that most of east Asia never saw massive PC adoption and so their internet developed in a very mobile-centric way. This hasn&#x27;t been surprising for a long time? reply michaelt 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure I agree.I mean, back when the west had WAP there were articles saying NTT DoCoMo had much more advanced phone technology, sure.But in terms of making it into the cultural consciousness - you don&#x27;t see ubiquitous asia-specific mobile super-apps in cultural exports like &#x27;Squid Game&#x27; or &#x27;Spy X Family&#x27; (admittedly a lot of cultural exports aren&#x27;t set in the present day) reply mardifoufs 13 hours agorootparentprevIs that inherently greater than not being connected or using super apps? Also, I didn&#x27;t know Tokyo or japan in general were also into the \"big app\" concept. Japan in general didn&#x27;t seem that \"connected\" relatively speaking back in 2017-18 but maybe stuff has changed in the past couple of years. reply refulgentis 15 hours agorootparentprevI think I&#x27;m missing some context: ex. there&#x27;s O(many) apps that offer hotspot connections in the US as well. And my understanding is there&#x27;s a privacy concern, which I think would be exacerbated by a super-app like WeChat adding this.What&#x27;s the great certain things of all that? reply vinay_ys 16 hours agoparentprevEven if only genuine hotspot apps got the entitlement, it is not a user-friendly privacy-first design. Such API use should trigger a user-visible permission dialog before apps get background-notified and user should be able to select the one of \"allow-once, allow while using, allow-in-background, never\" and the app activity should show up in app privacy reports. reply TylerE 11 hours agorootparentNot sure I agree - in fact pretty sure I don’t. Having lots of permission dialogs just trains users to mindlessly click yes on everything, because they just want to do the thing, not think about how the sausage is made. reply ubercow13 8 hours agorootparentSo just don&#x27;t have them, and don&#x27;t let them think about it? reply TylerE 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m saying that a default of \"ask every single time\" is not good. For anyone. reply iforgotpassword 17 hours agoparentprevBecause the Chinese market is too important. For wechat you can maybe argue that it&#x27;s a \"super app\" and probably also can be used to connect to wifi hotspots, but for alipay I fail to come up with an explanation.. reply physicles 17 hours agorootparentAlipay is also pretty much an everything app (it also has its own ecosystem of mini-apps built on Alipay&#x27;s platform). Except for the social aspect, it&#x27;s nearly interchangeable with WeChat. reply iforgotpassword 17 hours agorootparentAh I see. It&#x27;s been a while thanks to the pandemic that I&#x27;ve been there, and even then preferred just doing wechat so I dont have to deal with even more stuff. At least for regular payment almost all places accepted both options. reply BertoldVdb 14 hours agorootparentprevYou can buy hotspot access with Alipay (scan QR code -> connect), presumably thats why. reply paxys 16 hours agorootparentprevThe sensible move would really be to break up these \"everything\" apps. Sure WeChat may have a wifi service, but if it is being used by 0.01% of the user base then why is everyone else forced to approve the permissions? Creating a separate \"WeChat Wifi Connector\" takes zero extra effort on their part. reply shkkmo 16 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have to break up the app, just require user opt in to enable the feature for the app. reply gruez 17 hours agoparentprev>API seems to specifically be for apps created by owners of WiFi hotspots to help users connect to those hotspots.VPN apps also seem to use it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pia-foss&#x2F;mobile-ios&#x2F;blob&#x2F;4618b55161ec5b8b... reply lxgr 11 hours agoparentprevApparently the entitlement is not required in a few other conditions, listed here [1] by Apple: 1. application is using CoreLocation API and has user&#x27;s authorization to access precise location. [This seems harmless – the app already gets the precise location anyway here.] 2. application has used NEHotspotConfiguration API to configure the current Wi-Fi network. [This seems to be the scope of the article!] 3. application has active VPN configurations installed. [This one is quite surprising to me!] 4. application has active NEDNSSettingsManager configuration installed. [No idea what this is exactly, but it seems similar to the VPN one.][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;thread&#x2F;679038 reply Tigress8780 7 hours agoparentprevThese \"super apps\" get special treatment everywhere.Many phone manufacturers even automatically grant certain permissions when these apps are installed (the list is sometimes hard-coded into the system), since there are people who do not understand what is \"permission\", and they blame the phone manufacturer for not being able to use WeChat&#x2F;Alipay. reply _heimdall 16 hours agoparentprevIts a more basic question to me, why do these apps need a special entitlement? Couldn&#x27;t they ask users for permissions like any other app, presumably with a good reason to go along with it since location is needed for some features? reply gorbypark 14 hours agorootparentApple wants to gatekeep the feature for \"legitimate\" uses. If it was just another permission, random flashlight apps (as the joke goes) would ask for the permission and _n_% of people would just blindly accept it. Then, of course, Apple would get blamed for allowing random flashlight apps to track people&#x27;s location. Of course this could all be done via the regular app review process, but Apple seems to have decided on a few permissions they want to keep super locked down (CarPlay is another, to avoid blame for when someone crashes while using some CarPlay app). reply diebeforei485 14 hours agoparentprevThis is functionally a Location Services feature, so the user should grant location permissions to use this.I am not sure how it works in practice. reply coldcode 19 hours agoprevFYI, that API requires entitlements to be used, which are only available if you request them from Apple and justify their use. It&#x27;s not a general-purpose API any app can use. reply lxgr 19 hours agoparentThat’s not really any consolation, since (according to the article) Apple has granted that entitlement to WeChat and Alipay.Yes, these are “super-apps” and Wi-Fi hotspot services are probably part of their offerings, but that’s just more reason this should be a user-grantable permission like “local network access”. If I don’t care for the hotspot feature, I don’t want the app to have that capability. reply MBCook 18 hours agorootparentCertain apps have always gotten special treatment. If it’s big enough to mess with phone sales they’re allowed nonsense a normal dev would be permanently banned for.Ex: all the stuff FB has been caught doing over the yearsMy understanding (no first hand experience) is that WeChat and Alipay are basically required in China. If a phone doesn’t have them, it’s worthless and won’t sell.So naturally they too can do nonsense that would get the rest of us booted to space. reply stavros 18 hours agorootparentWhy does apple get to decide which app gets automatic access to my private data, on my device, without needing to ask me? reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve asked similar questions before and am usually told that this is how Apple does things and it&#x27;s what makes their users happy. It&#x27;s in fact why they love and choose Apple. They trust Apple to make the right decisions, and this is in fact a big part of the value add of their products. This is much related to the walled garden approach. For example, ask about why sideloading should remain not an option at all, rather than something like Android where you can enable it if you want to but \"Grandma\" isn&#x27;t going to accidentally do it. Apple users actively don&#x27;t want that capability. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, but that&#x27;s because \"I&#x27;m not their target market.\" reply JoshTriplett 15 hours agorootparent> Apple users actively don&#x27;t want that capabilityThat&#x27;s a self-fulfilling property, with cause and effect going as much in the other direction: people who want that capability don&#x27;t become Apple users. If you want openness, you don&#x27;t pick Apple. reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentprevYou’re missing a probably sizable fraction of Apple users that don’t love this, but also don’t hate it enough to switch to something else for that reason alone.It’s very similar to political parties: I have yet to find one that I 100% align with in all things, yet I still vote. reply bloppe 15 hours agorootparentprevThis mentality is fascinating to me. In a sense, nobody owns an Apple device. It&#x27;s more like renting: the landlord keeps a bunch of doors locked and has strict rules, but the place comes pre-furnished and includes millennial-grade amenities.I can see the appeal if you don&#x27;t particularly care about owning a device, but it blows my mind that people become so dedicated to this way of living. reply nucleardog 6 hours agorootparentI think the renting analogy is a decent one and I’m on the other side of this, so let me give you my perspective.When you own a home, you are 100% liable and responsible. If anything breaks, it’s an unexpected demand on my time and&#x2F;or an unexpected expense. When you rent, you just call the landlord and say “shit’s broke” and it’s no longer your responsibility. I don’t have the mental bandwidth these days for the unexpected demands the house places on me.This is _exactly_ the experience I had with Android versus iPhone.I bought the original Android Dev Phone 1. Still have it somewhere. Moved to a Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4, couple of OnePlus phones, etc. Used the stock Android, Cyanogenmod, LineageOS, and others. Did all sorts of fun stuff.Then my life got busier and busier and busier and I found myself sitting up late one night dicking with fixing something on my phone again and just was like nope, this is not how I need or want to be spending my time. My life has only gotten busier since. I don’t have time for suddenly finding out one day that the last update that I installed broke the microphone on my phone and I can no longer use it as a phone.Using the iPhone is having a landlord. If it breaks, it’s just broken. Not only do I not need to feel responsible for fixing it, I couldn’t if I wanted to. It takes up no space in my head.So the fact that Apple (1) generally doesn’t release terribly broken software; (2) supports their devices with updates for a long time; and (3) is vaguely respectful of privacy and security makes the iPhone an obvious winner for me.Even just making sideloading _available_ is going to shift the space my phone sits in my head. It’s no longer going to be “it works or it doesn’t, if it works and you don’t like how it works that sucks nothing to do about it so you may as well forget about it”. It’s going to be a constant “this is vaguely annoying I bet I could find a replacement dialer that _does_ allow you to search your call history…”. I’ll literally pay a premium for someone to take options away from me rather than have yet another place I need to exercise my self control.I already spend all day with needy computers fixing and improving and such. Having a dumb appliance that lets me not do that is what I _want_. reply q-base 3 hours agorootparentprevI love that your analogy hit me so hard that I came to question my iPhone SE. I think the main issue for me is that I have not found a better alternative elsewhere. There are some interesting locked down and privacy focused variants of Android, but I am not sure I could use them with the banking and personal ID apps that are almost \"required\" unless I have to jump through additional hoops daily.But thought provoking analogy - and thanks for that! reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you greatly overestimate how big of a deal this lack of user choice is to most people.Nobody needs to be dedicated to a lack of choice&#x2F;freedom for Apple&#x27;s business model to work.Being begrudgingly ok with it works just as well, just like they don’t price their products at “oh wow, that’s a steal, I’ll take one as a spare”, but rather somewhere close to “oh wow, but I guess I don’t buy this every day, and maybe with an installment plan…” reply averageRoyalty 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s unlikely that if you have a mobile phone, the landlord doesn&#x27;t keep some doors locked.At minimum - even if you&#x27;re running de-Googled Android - the baseband blob has high levels of access and you have no control over it.I&#x27;m not saying Apple isn&#x27;t worse with this, but the illusion of phone ownership spreads a lot further. reply madars 11 hours agorootparentBaseband blobs are isolated with IOMMU (at least on GrapheneOS https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;faq#baseband-isolation, but maybe that&#x27;s also true for stock Pixels idk) and Google spends a lot of effort on baseband security: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.googleblog.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;hardening-cellular-b... reply lxgr 9 hours agorootparentprevNot to get too philosophical, but the entire concept of ownership per se is always a social contract that&#x27;s being renegotiated continuously by society. Almost every country in the world has limits on the things you can own, to give just one example.I do see the value of having autonomy over the devices I conduct my digital life on (whether owned or rented, for that matter!), but I&#x27;m not sure if the concept of physical ownership is the right model here.How my personal data is being processed in other people&#x27;s and the government&#x27;s systems is just as relevant to me, and conversely, I&#x27;m fine with some opaque blobs of other people running on my hardware, as long as they&#x27;re properly sandboxed (i.e. can&#x27;t phone home freely or access any of my data that&#x27;s none of their business), and I see the mutual benefit in them. reply scyzoryk_xyz 8 hours agorootparentprevOh I do want this functionality from them and I already actually do get it on MacOS, where grandma or my mom can use the App Store while I can still get an installer dmg with „this app was downloaded from internet do you trust it yadda yadda” warning. They’ret capable of doing it, they just don’t because AppStore makes a lot of nasty monopoly $. reply wredue 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not that I trust Apple, it’s that I trust Apple infinitely more than I trust the largest spy network on earth and existing without a smartphone today is difficult.If you need a smartphone, you can choose between a company that has some missteps, or a demonstrably evil spy network. I know who I am choosing. reply freedomben 14 hours agorootparentThanks, your position certainly makes sense to me regarding a Pixel phone with the stock software on it, but much less so when considering options like GrapheneOS or any of the Androids made by other non-Google companies (like OnePlus, etc). That&#x27;s the point at which usually \"user experience\" or \"I&#x27;m already in the Apple ecosystem\" usually come to fore-front as the reason.I don&#x27;t really trust of those big companies, which is where GrapheneOS really shines. Open source, lots of enhanced privacy controls, but also as much of the Google ecosystem as the user wants. If you maximally distrust everyone, you can roll with pure FOSS. If you&#x27;re somewhere in the middle like most people, you can pick and choose the pieces that are worth it to you (Google&#x27;s Pixel Camera app is a common one for example). Graphene OS is also trivial to install now thanks to the web installer, so pretty much anybody who can load a web page, plug in a USB cable, and follow the explicit instructions to unlock the bootloader (which is stuff like, \"open settings\" -> \"click about\", etc) can do it. reply nucleardog 6 hours agorootparentWhere do I buy a GrapheneOS phone from a manufacturer that tests the entire package and releases updates?I’ve done the “just buy unlocked hardware and install this or that” in the past. My phone ended up taking up way more of my time than I’m willing to let it and my life has only gotten busier since. reply saiya-jin 15 hours agorootparentprevI have to agree with this sentiment, I read it here on HN &#x27;power&#x27; users more than once. Although most Apple users have no clue about what we discuss here, the part about actively wanting it is simply not true en masse.Needless to say that&#x27;s not for me and I will probably keep sporting Androids (in my case I am happy with Samsung&#x27;s top ultra offerings) since I actually use those added features, ie saving 500 bucks on proper expensive variometer for paragliding and instead hooking it up via OTG cable with basic one with good sensor but without display, for 10% of the price... needless to say relevant app isn&#x27;t on play store neither. And so on.But we certainly have choice on the market. I just wish Apple would properly focus on user security and shielding them from the worst of internet, and less on milking advertising, what I see so far didn&#x27;t convince me it isn&#x27;t just sophisticated marketing and not much more. You already pay premium on the device, its a proper spit in the face to be so visibly milked more and more, thats pure corporate greed.What I mean - my wife with iphone pops up browser, I pop up mine with firefox and ublock origin.

IIRC an entitlement only means you can ask for this sort of access, not get it automatically, but I may be wrong (I’ve never gotten far in iOS dev).We can argue that this feature is misnamed, regular users will not understand what it is and would not be giving informed consent, and I can get behind that, but “automatic access to my private data on my device” looks like jumping to conclusions. reply lxgr 13 hours agorootparentThat’s not what that permission does. As mentioned in TFA, SSID scanning access requires an entitlement (granted by Apple), not a permission (granted by the user). reply anileated 2 hours agorootparentYou are misunderstanding what entitlements are. An entitlement does not imply no consent from the user, in many cases all it gives is the ability to ask for that consent. reply gruez 17 hours agorootparentprev> FWIW I used WeChat a few years ago and at that point it definitely asked for local network access (which is what this article is about; a mechanism for collecting SSIDs which can then later be correlated to locations).Is that what \"local network access\" means? I thought that was for controlling network connections to LAN ips and&#x2F;or to send multicast packets (eg. mdns). reply anileated 17 hours agorootparent> there was a VPN app I used that didn&#x27;t have the \"local network access\" permission, but was still inexplicably able to get a list of wifi networks I connected toIt is different from continuously getting a list of all SSIDs within your Wi-Fi range, even those you never connected to. This is what allows shady apps infer location (this, and massive databases of SSID matched to coordinates).What you described is also a feature of WireGuard iOS, and it needed no permission. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentAs far as I can tell, Wireguard does it the other way around (i.e. you provide it with a list of SSIDs you want to always enable VPN for, it provides that to the OS, and the OS then only tells the VPN that it needs to get connected).But according to this [1] post (by an Apple employee?), having an enabled VPN profile seems to indeed be opting the app in to receiving the current SSID without the location permission, at least for some time and since iOS 14.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;thread&#x2F;679038 reply anileated 2 hours agorootparentI may have mixed up WireGuard versions, it does it on macOS but doesn’t on iOS (or this feature was removed).Either way, being able to get a list of networks user connected to is unrelated to the feature under discussion. reply stavros 18 hours agorootparentprevHm, I assume any app can ask for whatever it wants, but that&#x27;s just an assumption. I don&#x27;t know if app developers need to apply to be able to request permissions, but I don&#x27;t own an iPhone. reply MBCook 18 hours agorootparentCertain things require permission from Apple to be able to even use. The API in question here is one of them.Other things are just available to any developer but have to have a user prompt, for example saving to the photo library. reply anileated 17 hours agorootparentprevI was remembering when trying out iOS development years back that entitlements were needed for many things and the ones I tried involved a consent screen.From looking at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;bundleresources&#x2F;en... I would say there are many more entitlements than consent screens, the phrasing suggests there is no 1:1 mapping between them and is not clear on whether they reliably come with consent screens (I suspect not).It is very unfortunate that there is little clarity on that in the docs, and that entitlements are not exposed anywhere in the GUI. Sure, they are too technical, but they could at least be shown in some advanced info pane.

I get asked if I want to give “local network” access to apps sometimes (- lot these days actually) which I take to mean the ability to see local WiFi hotspots. I almost always deny this (and after reading this just turned it off for Spotify). I think the dialog that asks for permission could be improved, though, as most people don’t realize this can be used to deduce their location. reply iamcalledrob 17 hours agoparentAs a developer, the annoying thing about the \"Local Network\" permission is that:1) It&#x27;s poorly implemented. Unlike other permissions, there&#x27;s no way to explicitly trigger the prompt. It just pops up at Apple&#x27;s discretion. There&#x27;s no way to give it a \"soft landing\" for cases where it&#x27;s necessary for core app features. And there&#x27;s no way to check if the permission has been granted or not.2) More importantly: Apple&#x27;s own apps don&#x27;t trigger this warning, which makes the playing field unfair. AirPlay etc. work seamlessly, whereas any competitor&#x27;s tech doesn&#x27;t. And as a developer, since you can&#x27;t tell if this permission has been granted or not, you&#x27;re left with a poor user experience.I&#x27;m particularly fed up of (2). If Apple is going to introduce restrictions, they need to apply to their own apps as well. AirPlay and AirDrop need to each ask for Bluetooth and local network access. The Photos app needs to trigger the \"Select photos, Allow All, Deny\" prompt on launch. The Camera app shouldn&#x27;t be able to write to the photo library without triggering the same prompt too.That gives them an incentive to design the user experience around these restrictions well, and maybe be more creative with how to solve for this too rather than confusing dialogs.Currently they have a disincentive to design this stuff well. Any iOS developer that&#x27;s had to work with these APIs knows that they are designed absolutely awfully with arbitrary and unexpected limitations. reply woah 15 hours agorootparentThe developer of the Camera app already has access to all the photos in your Photos app. What benefit would a prompt have for the user? reply iamcalledrob 13 hours agorootparentNot sure if this is what you mean, but there could be multiple apps installed that write to the device photo library. You may not want the developer of one camera app to be able to access all photos on the device.But this raises a related point about how frustrating Apple&#x27;s APIs are here: When an app is granted the \"Write to photo library\" permission by the user, it can only write. It can&#x27;t read back what it&#x27;s written, ever. You might expect that writing to the library might return a token that can be used to read that photo back. Nope.Android, for all its faults, does a much better job here. The OS keeps track of the app that wrote the photo -- and that app can read that photo indefinitely, unless another app edits that photo (and thus becomes the owner). A much better design.On iOS, to read back photos from the library, you have to ask for the \"All photos\" read permission, which few people will grant you. \"Why does my camera want to read all the photos on my device?! Deny!\".And just like that, you can&#x27;t compete with the built-in camera which shows thumbnails of recently taken photos and allows you to swipe through them.Apple has no incentive to fix this either, because their own apps bypass this permission system. reply thombles 11 hours agorootparentprevNo argument from me but regarding workarounds for (1), accessing ProcessInfo.processInfo.hostName has been a reliable pop-up trigger for me for a long time.

I ALWAYS deny this access unless the app specifically requires it, and that is rare.WiFi based geolocationing should be a well known privacy threat by now. The popup should really communicate that better and provide tighter controls. reply graftak 18 hours agorootparentprevYou’d think that AirPlay would be abstracted away by an OS API that does the local network discovery itself. reply ascagnel_ 18 hours agorootparentIn my experience, it is. My podcast app of choice doesn’t have that permission (I don’t even think it asked for it), but it has the ability to bring up the system audio output selector widget and do AirPlay.If anything, I usually see this for apps that want to do playback via Chromecast&#x2F;Miracast. The well-behaved apps wait until the user interacts with Chromecast output, the iffier ones ask on first launch. reply dwaite 16 hours agorootparentprevAVRouting in iOS 16 allows for a Media Device Discovery Extensions, which allows for a proper ChromeCast or similar app to provide media streaming in the same interface as AirPlay.So far there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any traction by Google to migrate to this. reply teekert 18 hours agoparentprevI take it to mean that it will scan my lan (plus tailnet?) for services.

No one expects Apple to get it perfect. Computing platforms are legitimately hard to secure, especially when you’re talking about privacy which is a lot more amorphously defined culturally vs typical CS security which is defined as subverting technical access controls.The key question is whether Apple will play a curator role in trying to reign in the ecosystem. They have in the past (eg Uber was doing shady shit and there was a game of chicken to get them to stop). Of course Alipay and WeChat may be harder especially how Apple China is such a huge market for Apple and critical to their success now. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple adjusts to this over the next few years.Open platforms also have this problem and also operate on pinky promises (perhaps even worse) so I’m not sure the point you’re trying to make unless it’s that “well if this problem isn’t solved I’d rather have an open platform”. The problem with that argument is that there are many issues and this is only one failure case which may be addressed in the future whereas open platforms have this one and many more that are unadressed. reply thund 15 hours agorootparentOpen platforms can be reviewed and fixed more easily and faster reply vlovich123 14 hours agorootparentCan you clarify with examples&#x2F;technical description how an open platform will be able to review & fix privacy&#x2F;security issues like this more easily&#x2F;faster?

Heck, even the developer doesn’t know what it’s doing a lot of the time (how long does it take to figure out what’s happening with a tricky bug?).So yes, Apple’s policies do mediate what a developer can do on behalf of the user. That’s how it works. reply mcphage 16 hours agorootparentprev> I had the first iPhone up to the 3GS.

Everything is moving in the direction from \"Apps can do whatever they feel like\" to \"Apple controls what apps can do\" to \"The user controls what apps can do\".This specific leak seems like it&#x27;s stuck in the \"Apple controls what apps can do\" stage, so hopefully this post will help get it moving again. reply tjoff 18 hours agoparentprevBig whoop.

It’s unsustainable. As much as we want to fight for what we believe is a fantastic product that really should exist, the truth is that we can’t win a cat-and-mouse game with the largest company on earth. With our latest software release, we believe we’ve created something that Apple can tolerate existing. We do not have any current plans to respond if this solution is knocked offline. The iMessage connection software that powers Beeper Mini and Beeper Cloud is now 100% open source (github.com/beeper/imessage). Anyone who wants can use it or continue development. In the new year, we’re shifting focus back to our long-term goal of building the best chat app on earth. Beeper Mini is beautiful, fast and fun. Our main goal with the app is to upgrade chats between iPhone and Android users from unencrypted green bubble SMS to encrypted, fully featured blue bubble chats. This is a huge win for both iPhone and Android users in the US, where texting via SMS is the default form of chat. The only people on the ‘other’ side of this debate seem to be Apple and some ardent online supporters. Apple and other commentators have made a number of claims about Beeper Mini, including a public statement to The Verge. These claims are serious, but flawed. “These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure” It’s straightforward to verify that Beeper Mini is not a malicious app designed to steal your messages and accounts, or harvest your data. If you want, you can inspect the code of our core open source iMessage bridge (which is embedded inside Beeper Mini), and self-host it yourself to prove that it only connects to Apple servers. So let’s put to rest the idea that Beeper Mini is inherently insecure. If Apple wants to accuse us of being insecure, they need to back that up with hard evidence. We’re eager to fix any security issues reported by Apple or anyone else. The truth is that Beeper Mini upgrades insecure chats between iPhone and Android contacts and makes them secure with end-to-end encryption. By blocking Beeper Mini, Apple is actively harming their own iPhone customers by forcing them to fall back to insecure SMS chats. We believe that, for this reason alone, their actions are morally indefensible. “…exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage” As we shared in our recent blog post, Beeper uses real registration data from real Macs and iPhones. These credentials are being used by real people, with real Apple accounts, to send real iMessages. Many Beeper Mini users tell us that they are Apple customers with Macbooks or iPads, etc, but choose to use an Android smartphone. All they want to do is continue their iMessage chats on their phone. Honestly, we don’t understand this claim at all. “…enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks” Uh, isn’t that what SMS is for? 😂 With iMessage, Apple even has the ability to block spammers and scammers at the network layer. It’s much easier for them to block iMessage spam than SMS spam, which can only be blocked client-side. We don’t really understand this argument at all. Keep in mind that from an iPhone user’s perspective, there is no way to tell if it’s a new iMessage or a new SMS message in the inbox. You can’t tell that they are different until you open the chat. “Apple’s going to support RCS next year, just wait for that!” On Nov 16, Apple sent a 3 sentence statement to 9to5Mac saying that they are planning to support RCS. This would be great! Beeper has supported RCS since August. We’d immediately switch to using this for iPhone ↔ Android chats. Very few hard facts are available. It’s not clear if Apple’s RCS will support the same encryption protocol as Google’s RCS. Just one year ago, Tim Cook had this to say about RCS: \"I don't hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point. […] Buy your mom an iPhone.” Long story short, I will believe it when I see it. Apple has a long history of claiming they will support an open standard, then failing to add support. In 2010, Steve Jobs promised that Apple ‘would make FaceTime an open industry standard’. That never happened. More recently, in 2021, Apple promised to open their Find My network to competitors like Tile. Instead, they’ve penalized Tile by additional warnings in front of their app. Beeper Mini has a working solution to this problem today. Why should iPhone customers and Android users have to wait for Apple to adopt RCS? What if their implementation is delayed? What if they cancel it? “Apple is within their rights to run iMessage how they see fit” This might be true if Apple was a small company. But they aren’t. They control more than 50% of the US smartphone market, and lock customers into using Apple’s official app for texting (which, in the US, sadly, is the default way people communicate). Large companies that dominate their industry must follow a different set of rules that govern fair competition, harm to consumers and barriers to innovation. We are not experts in antitrust law, but Apple’s actions have already caught the attention of US Congress and the Department of Justice. “But you guys are making money off Apple’s servers!” We stopped charging for Beeper Mini on Dec 11, and Beeper Cloud has always been free to use. Additionally, Beeper Mini users chat with paying Apple customers on the other side of the conversation! If Apple proposed some way for us to reimburse them for the (minuscule) infrastructure costs of enabling paying iPhone customers to text Android users, we’d be happy to comply with that. Our preference is to charge for our app because it allows us to align our interests with those of our customers, compared with ‘free’ apps that do questionable things with user data to make money. At this stage, Apple’s actions to block Beeper Mini look increasingly hard for Apple to defend. The only potential reason Apple has left is that they might make less money selling iPhones if iMessage were available on Android. Some Apple folks have admitted that ‘iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones’. Our hope is that Apple has more faith in their overall product offering than to think that people buy iPhones just to get a blue bubble.

The younger and more athletic guy who was topping the chart will go down severly we it is mentionned he work as a car mechanic.And it is the same with men with other factors. Men will have a hard time engaging with women that can present too smart and will often \"target\" women that act in a way that make you think their intellectual capabilities are lower.And both men and women play with those when interacting with strangers of the opposite gender.It is only with time spent with people that we overcome some of these basic signals and preconceptions about people, reason why we very often end up having long relationship with people we don&#x27;t meet randomly in a dancefloor, dating app but rather colleagues&#x2F;ex-colleagues, business partners, friends of relatives with which we interact a number of times before actually start dating. reply talldatethrow 3 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re 40.

To the US consumer, Whatsapp and the like are not texting. Frankly it makes total sense that this is the way it is in the US, because most people do not want to waste their time using a messaging app that can only message a fraction of people. They want an app that can message 100% of people. Apple Messages can do that, as can every other texting app, because the lowest common denominator technology (SMS, soon to be RCS especially once Apple ships it) is supported on every single handset. You never need to guess if a phone number is on Whatsapp or Signal or Telegram. You can just send a text to it.This is pretty different to the international dynamic, as MMS often comes at a surcharge in many non-US markets, but here unlimited MMS has been included in most plans for a very long time, so there&#x27;s not even a \"hey, you are costing me money\" stigma involved like there was in the bad old days decades ago. reply agos 40 minutes agorootparentthere is no \"guessing\", the person giving you their number can also tell you which platform they are on (in my country 99,9% of the time it will be Whatsapp).making an antitrust case on the basis of \"I don&#x27;t want to guess\" seems weak, but law can always turn out counterintuitive reply josephcsible 4 hours agorootparentprevBy going out of their way to make the experience worse when texting people who don&#x27;t use iMessage. reply jonhohle 4 hours agorootparentIn what way? reply Exoristos 1 hour agorootparentThey don&#x27;t give them a blue bubble. replycwillu 9 hours agorootparentprevLast century it was bell whining about customers connecting unauthorized equipment to their network.

None.That is unless we’re talking about Beeper being the defendant.They have incurred criminal liability by violating the CFAA and committing computer trespass and civil liability by violating the the OS license agreement and ToS that both prohibit reverse engineering (yes that supersedes DMCA exception) not to mention the general copyright violations of reselling Apple’s IP for $2&#x2F;mo (pypush isn’t without proprietary Apple code).CCIPS would have a field day with this and if by some weird “blow up in your face fashion” they get their hands on the referral after the antitrust division of the DOJ is done shrugging at it, Beeper might get more than they bargained for.The only thing that could actually affect Apple in this, is if legislators pass new bills. The problem however is that this would have cascading effects across the industry, if not the economy as a whole, because there’s no way to legislate this in such a way that it would only affect Apple and Apple alone.Anything short of that makes for a fun fantasy that I’m sure some people will get off on, but a fantasy nonetheless. reply stuartjohnson12 11 hours agorootparent> unless we’re talking about Beeper being the defendantYes that&#x27;s the point, Beeper are probably hoping Apple sues them for the reasons you describe.> criminal liability by violating the CFAA and committing computer trespassThis is pretty tenuous.

Any case there would be access violations under the CCFA which are already covered above.The only real claim would be the intellectual property of the client app in the way that it forms requests and accepts responses which this system is undoubtedly based on the reverse engineering of. The only problem with that argument is that the DMCA includes a specific exemption for interoperability as fair use.Note that simply building a new client app doesn&#x27;t necessarily constitute fair use, but in this case the client app extends to a platform that is otherwise not supported.

ToS violation was a generic argument and not the contentious part.Meanwhile Bowers v. Baystate Technologies, Inc. is current standing law on reverse engineering clauses in ToS and EULAs, while the matter at hand has nothing to do with publicly accessible data, no exceeding of authorized access and no data scraping.> The other question is whether Beeper is violating terms of service or their users are.That would be Beeper, no question about it. They had to agree to the OS license agreement that prohibits reverse engineering and the ToS for Apple Media Services that also prohibit reverse engineering, before they could get to the parts that needed the reverse engineering they did.The users didn’t do any reverse engineering, although they would be in violation of the terms that state iMessage (and other Apple services and software) is only licensed to be used on Apple devices. But that’s small fry in comparison to reverse engineering, repackaging and reselling Apple’s service without a license to do so.> I&#x27;m guessing Beeper is not and they instead need to be implicated for some kind of tortious interference.Tortious interference has more to do with affecting a relationship you’re not a party to.

But such a case isn’t something you cobble together in an afternoon.In my experience a lead time for something like this is at least about a month, a week if it’s urgent and less if it’s really urgent and you seek an injunction (and then you try to flesh it out afterwards).But ideally you want to take your time so you can discuss your strategy both internally with higher ups as well as with outside counsel, collect exhibits and draft up a solid initial filing.Part of these discussions is also what kind of exposure you’ll have during discovery. Apple for example genuinely believes that Masimo used Apple’s internal confidential documents that Masimo received during discovery in the California trial to create the competing W1 smartwatch.It could be that they’re weary of having to share more internal information, especially since so much has already come out during the last couple of years full of cases. Or wary that Beeper would learn more about the inner workings of iMessage.I wouldn’t characterize it as a high priority matter with urgency either because they seem able and effective in blocking Beeper, with little loss in device sales as a result.A lot of effort is going towards the Apple Watch issue with Masimo that prevents them from selling the newest models.Lastly, while only of minor importance, it’s slightly more beneficial for Apple if Beeper would sue them while they keep successfully blocking Beeper than Apple suing Beeper.All in all, it’s a lot of weighing pros and cons, even when you’re in the right. That’s one of the reason why there are so many settlements, because it often is cheaper, faster and easier than a whole trial. reply rezonant 2 hours agorootparentprevInvoking the CFAA for messaging interoperability is a pretty dystopian take.

There is no reason at all to think you&#x27;re entitled to access that service without using the aforementioned devices, and there&#x27;s even less reason to be surprised in the slightest that, when a company was offering services to bypass those requirements and use the API without meeting Apple&#x27;s requirements, that Apple would shut that shit right down. reply Nextgrid 11 hours agorootparent> You are not allowed to use it without an iPhone, an iPad, or a Mac and you never have been allowed to use it otherwiseWhat about for those who do own an Apple device and thus paid the \"tax\" to use iMessage, but want&#x2F;need to use it on unapproved devices out of convenience?

Should this still be illegal?Again, you and most critics are keeping your examples and your metaphors solely isolated to your phone, your device, your computer and this is not the case. iMessage chats are not peer-to-peer, they reside on a platform which Apple pays to host and operate. You are not just using your device, you are using their devices too via the API.No examples put forth in your comment or other comments are grappling with this reality. The iMessage API doesn&#x27;t call other Apple devices, it calls Apple&#x27;s servers, and Apple owns those servers and is within their rights to dictate how they are used. Every photo sent, every live photo, video, voice message, all are hosted and archived forever until the user deletes them on Apple&#x27;s servers. That in and of itself is, in my mind, justification to restrict the service&#x27;s use to their own devices. reply Nextgrid 9 hours agorootparentDoes it matter if an Apple device user (having bought a device and paid Apple for access to iMessage servers) subsequently makes software that mimics this Apple device&#x27;s interaction with the servers but runs this software on his Android device?We&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s still a single person using it, thus whether they use it on Apple or Android, the amount of messages sent shouldn&#x27;t increase (they&#x27;d just be spread across the two devices) and server load should thus remain constant.Would it be a problem?

It also feels to me (IANAL) like that’s part of the anticompetitiveness. Apple uses its dominance in phones to establish dominance in messaging apps.

That’s pretty much the only limitation.Other than that, there’s pretty much complete feature parity with iMessage in terms of native access, available should the third party messaging service want to implement it (and many do).Take WhatsApp for example.

In fact I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s bordering on impossible unless you buy an iDevice and do it by hand, at which point, Apple can see your suspicious traffic and disconnect you from the network, possibly without you even knowing you&#x27;ve been.That&#x27;s not to say they couldn&#x27;t secure it in a way to combat abuse, but again, why? What does Apple gain here apart from a happy nod from a userbase that is wanting to use an Android phone and an iPad? iMessage is a free service that Apple fans enjoy using. They gain nothing by making it open to people who don&#x27;t use Apple devices, and that freedom for you comes at a security cost to the platform as a whole and the users in it. Apple is very clear that their priority (apart from profits) is their users, and this gains their users incredibly little while opening the platform to much wider instances of abuse that are already incredibly common.And even aside of my views and understanding of systems integrity and API use&#x2F;misuse, frankly, even just the anti-spam excuse would be enough for me to support them in this unilaterally, because as a service, iMessage is the only platform I make regular use of that I don&#x27;t end up getting calls about my cars extended warranty, or messages from hot russian women who want to bang me, or people asking to buy my stupid house, or assholes telling me they&#x27;ve hacked my PC and are going to send videos of me jerking off to my family, or whatever the hell.

But that’s not true and in fact there is very clear precedent that matches the facts of the case at hand.Quicken and other scrapers are generally allowed, especially, but exclusively, when it pertains publicly accessible data.Those kinds of cases have been tried with the main argument being the exceeding of authorization under the CFAA and copyright violations.Courts have consistently decided that scraping doesn’t rise to the levels of computer trespass in the form of exceeding the authorization given to access the computer system and that it’s not copyright violation primarily because, to put it simply, it doesn’t exceed the authorization enough and because there’s a fair use component to it.The most recent case law on this, which happens to involve publicly available data so isn’t fully analogue with Quicken, is hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn[0]However, there’s also case law on clauses in EULAs and ToSs that prohibit reverse engineering (like in the case of Apple’s EULAs and ToS) that says those clauses are not only enforceable but they supersede the DMCA reverse engineering exception.In fact the case law is even more relevant for this Beeper debacle, because it also happens to pertain to a company that reverse engineered another companies software, repackaged it to then sell it for a price, like Beeper tried to do with Beeper mini for $2&#x2F;mo.

You are welcome to not use it (and buy an Apple device) or even fall back to SMS.The recipient can themselves decide what level of security they want and whether they trust Beeper (but they don&#x27;t need Beeper to compromise their security - they can just as well post screenshots of your E2E-encrypted messages with them, make a backup on a compromised computer or leak their Apple&#x2F;iCloud credentials). reply amazingman 12 hours agorootparentEmail isn&#x27;t end to end encrypted. FTP and SSH are client-server protocols whereas iMessage is client-server(s)-client.Do you actually believe these things you&#x27;re claiming, or are you arguing for the sake of contrarianism? reply Nextgrid 12 hours agorootparent> Email isn&#x27;t end to end encryptedE-mail can be end-to-end encrypted; you can use PGP (of which there are multiple implementations, all compatible) or some other custom cryptographic protocol. Having multiple compatible implementations does in no way prevent it from being secure.> FTP and SSH are client-server protocols whereas iMessage is client-server(s)-client.I don&#x27;t understand how iMessage and FTP are different? Both have a server which mediates communication between different clients. The FTP server accepts & persists files which other clients then see and can download. The iMessage server does something similar but with messages.> Do you actually believe these things you&#x27;re claimingYes? I believe every person should have the right to choose which software they use to interact with services, whether it&#x27;s first-party, third-party, or their own creation.

In other words, a proper encrypted messaging setup is not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks reply amazingman 7 hours agorootparent>When sending and receiving Signal, iMessage and WhatsApp messages, Beeper Cloud&#x27;s web service acts as a relay. For example, if you send a message from Beeper to a friend on WhatsApp, the message is encrypted on your Beeper Cloud client, sent to the Beeper Cloud web service, which decrypts and re-encrypts the message with WhatsApp&#x27;s proprietary encryption protocol.> Using native chat apps independently may be more secure than connecting to other encrypted chat networks with Beeper Cloud.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beeper.com&#x2F;faq#how-does-beeper-connect-to-encryp...Please tell me more about how Beeper can&#x27;t be used as a MiTM for E2E encrypted networks like Signal. reply nwiswell 14 hours agorootparentprev> Furthermore, I bet Beeper was outright hoping for a lawsuit from AppleDoubtful. Beeper has several legitimate causes of action to bring their own suit, if they really expect that outcome (and more importantly, if they have the financial resources to litigate) reply Nextgrid 14 hours agorootparentBeeper wouldn&#x27;t have any arguments to stand on had they initiated the lawsuit - after all, Apple is allowed to make changes to their protocol as they see fit.However, the regular pattern we&#x27;ve seen is that companies use copyright and&#x2F;or ToS as basis for C&D&#x27;ing (with threat of litigation) developers that produce adversarily-interoperable solutions.If Apple did so (and Apple would&#x27;ve absolutely done it if Beeper wasn&#x27;t a reasonably well-funded adversary), Beeper would suddenly have an argument, as well as the support of the media (\"Apple sues small company for opening up iMessage to Android\") and the potential to establish a legal precedent that would threaten not just Apple but the tech industry at large. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparentThis isn’t how the law works. If it’s a valid defence, it’s a valid injunction. reply Nextgrid 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think neither Beeper nor Apple is doing anything illegal here. Neither has any legs to stand on for a lawsuit.However, it&#x27;s a common pattern that large companies can shut down adversarially-interoperable projects by threatening litigation against the developers. The lawsuit might be baseless but would still require upfront resources to defend; this is what these companies rely on, so they get their way without the argument ever getting into a courtroom.If Apple brought forward such a lawsuit and Beeper actually litigated it to the end (and actually got it into a courtroom), it would risk creating a legal precedent that would enshrine adversarial interoperability as legal and make such future bullshit legal threats ineffective. That is a major risk not just for Apple but the tech industry at large. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentSure. But if that were Beeper’s goal, they’d file for an injunction. Waiting for someone to sue you to set precedent isn’t a thing in civil law. reply Nextgrid 13 hours agorootparentFair enough. I&#x27;m obviously just speculating here and my knowledge of the US legal system is hearsay.However, it seems that Beeper effectively got what they wanted (bipartisan calls for regulatory action against Apple, and lots of media coverage over the issue) without any lawyers being involved. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparent> Beeper effectively got what they wanted (bipartisan calls for regulatory action against AppleMedia attention, yes. Policy support, no. reply Nextgrid 13 hours agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t this count: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;beeper-mini-broken-antitrust&#x2F; ? reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentIt looks like a sounding document—you put it out and see who calls. If quality voters call in support, it gains momentum. If it’s crickets, or only people messaging why they like the status quo, it’s dropped. replyGeekyBear 12 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t think neither Beeper nor Apple is doing anything illegal here.Beeper could definitely be prosecuted by the Feds.Aaron Swartz is probably the most famous example of someone being prosecuted using the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He was merely accessing a web server without permission and wasn&#x27;t even trying to turn a profit. reply lxgr 8 hours agorootparentThe question is: Would they really?There are many instances of \"adversarial interoperability\" (somebody else already mentioned screen scraping of online banking for budget management tools already in a different thread), and I haven&#x27;t seen the CFAA being thrown at the responsible parties all that often.I&#x27;d be quite curious to see precedent being set here, but I doubt it&#x27;ll happen. Apple has much more to lose than to gain from that:They can play cat and mouse on the tech side as long as they want, but with all the attention and scrutiny of a lawsuit, I could see a small chance of Apple ending up having to open up their service for interoperability. reply GeekyBear 8 hours agorootparent> The question is: Would they really?If they&#x27;re willing to prosecute some kid who wasn&#x27;t even trying to make a profit off of his access to a web server, why wouldn&#x27;t they prosecute a company for trying to sell hacked access to someone else&#x27;s servers?Also, there have been many prosecutions under this law. Aaron&#x27;s case is just the most infamous example. reply prmoustache 2 hours agorootparentThis is totally different.Beeper is trying to use an api to send message to users. They are not getting nor trying to get shell access to apple servers. reply GeekyBear 29 minutes agorootparentNo, Beeper is using Apple&#x27;s servers without authorization, in the same way that Swartz was accessing web servers without authorizaton.madeofpalk 10 hours agorootparentprevExecutives, absolutely not. Apple is so opinionated and principled. Have you seen the emails that came out during recent trials where they state so clearly how much they deserve 30% of all commerce on their devices?They would have firmly believed that iMessage is their service that no one else has an entitlement to. If they had any involvement, it would be just one email to say to shut it down, and then never thought of it again. reply _Microft 14 hours agorootparentprevAs an iPhone user, I‘m pretty happy how Apple dealt with this so far. I would hate to get spammed on iMessage and knowing that my messages are rendered exactly as intended on the receiver’s side is reassuring.Calling this anti-consumer is rather subjective. reply prmoustache 44 minutes agorootparentSpam is a lame excuse.From what I have understood in the first beeper mini anonucement, iMessage spam does already exist.Also I never received spam on any open source messaging app, even when they were interconnected with gmail and facebook (xmpp). I&#x27;ve never received spam from telegram either, despite clients, protocol and API being open source. I have received less than a handful of spam on Whatsapp in more than 10 years. The only platform where I have received spam in their messaging app was instagram (I left in the meantime). It would be the same for iMessage. As long as spam is bound to a phone number, spammers will be banned the minute they start sending messages to people and will never reach you.Spam however is a big deal on SMS, which if I understand correctly end up on iMessage on Apple devices.So basically the Apple way is the worse way to deal with spam as all end up on the same app while on most other smartphone OS spam end up in the dedicated SMS messaging app that you can just totally ignore and disable notifications for. Apple does make it worse for its user in that context. reply luma 14 hours agorootparentprevThe Apple Stockholm Syndrome is endemic on HN. The lengths people will go to support open source and open access while also vehemently defending the exact opposite behavior from Apple is astounding. reply Grustaf 12 hours agorootparentIt’s not Stockholm syndrome, you incorrectly assume that every iPhone owner is some kind of mini Stallman. Most people really don’t care about all this stuff, they just want a product that works well, with minimum fuss. They don’t care about third party appstores. Sideloading, open sourcing imessage and all this linux hacker stuff. reply prmoustache 1 hour agorootparent> they just want a product that works wellIt doesn&#x27;t if it can&#x27;t reliably do basic things like sending e2ee messages to people using smartphones from other brands with its default messaging app. reply agos 41 minutes agorootparentis there a device that does this, or are we measuring iPhone&#x27;s performance on some unrealistic standard? reply treyd 7 hours agorootparentprev> Most people really don’t care about all this stuff, they just want a product that works well, with minimum fuss.And nonetheless there&#x27;s demonstrable harm to the broader industry being caused despite their lack of care about it. Corporate misbehavior you&#x27;re not consciously aware of can still cause you harm despite not being consciously aware of it. reply Grustaf 49 minutes agorootparentSure, when it comes to things like pollution, or for Apple, child labour. But the broader industry is not harmed by Apple not releasing the Messages app for Android, that’s just silly. reply _Microft 14 hours agorootparentprevI do more than enough tinkering but my phone‘s supposed to just work. reply luma 14 hours agorootparentHow is your tinkering enhanced by Apple making it difficult to communicate outside of their kingdom? reply riscy 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see Google making it easier to communicate outside of their kingdom. AFAIK Google&#x27;s RCS (with their encryption extensions) is not an industry standard or available for 3rd party apps to use. Why is the expectation only on Apple to make such changes? reply luma 12 hours agorootparentRCS is a spec ratified by the GSMA, the same standards body that specified things like SMS. Google tried to get Apple to do RCS, they refused, then Google tried to get a license to interop with iMessage and Apple refused again. Google has tried literally everything to try and get Apple to play ball here. reply riscy 12 hours agorootparent> One thing that isn’t part of the [RCS standard ratified by GSMA] is the encryption standard Google is adopting. It’s building it on top of RCS right into the Android Messages client.> If you are texting with somebody who isn’t using Android Messages (say, somebody using Samsung Messages or an iPhone), the fallback to either less-encrypted RCS chat or SMS will still work just fine.Sounds like Samsung users need to separately download Android Messages to get E2EE.Quotes from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;21574451&#x2F;android-rcs-enc... which is cited by Wikpedia on RCS. reply joshmanders 12 hours agorootparentprev> Google has tried literally everything to try and get Apple to play ball here.You&#x27;re framing it in a nefarious way as if Apple is flat out denying it. They didn&#x27;t. They would have to LOWER security in iPhones by implementing RCS because iMessages have E2EE but RCS doesn&#x27;t. Which is something all you anti-Apple people seem to conveniently leave out, because you know nobody would take it seriously if you said it. reply ruszki 11 hours agorootparentIn the thread to which you replied, somebody mentioned that it’s possible to do that on top RCS, and Google already did it. If Apple wants to make their own encryption they can do it, nothing stops them. Interoperability would still be better, just like in the case of Google with other RCS solutions. reply riscy 11 hours agorootparentPlease explain how interoperability between messaging apps is possible if two different, proprietary E2EE schemes are used atop RCS.Google&#x27;s interop \"solution\" with the Samsung messages app is by not using encryption. Apple has that same level of support coming to iOS next year, and has also announced plans to work with GSMA on adding standardized encryption to RCS. reply ruszki 11 hours agorootparentI like that you put Google’s solution into apostrophes, while Apple’s current solution has the same problem, and even more. But I’m glad that we agree. reply nicce 11 hours agorootparentprev> In the thread to which you replied, somebody mentioned that it’s possible to do that on top RCS, and Google already did itGoogle made a copy of iMessage since it is closed source and can talk to only to the same app. How is that better? reply ruszki 3 hours agorootparentI don’t know what you talk about, because both can talk to whatever they want, because both support SMS. reply nicce 2 hours agorootparentThen there isn’t issue with iMessage either?But you know what I mean - E2EE of Google Messages is closed solution. reply ruszki 2 hours agorootparentBoth have issues. iMessage has problems with interoperability, RCS has problems with requirement of operator support. reply jacksontrom 50 minutes agorootparentGoogle is still working on the standard and adding features to it. If their previous statement is true, they will open source it after that.xg15 11 hours agorootparentprevWell I guess then they should let other people interop with iMessage directly, so the E2EE can be kept. reply shawnz 11 hours agorootparentprevthe iPhone messages app already supports unencrypted SMS though reply paulmd 11 hours agorootparentprevthe best part is that I, as a google voice user, still don&#x27;t have RCS support even though it&#x27;s a google product.google implemented the exact minimum they&#x27;d need to give them a foot to cry on in the courts, and no further. and now that there is a mandate to implement RCS, they almost certainly will choose to kill google voice rather than implement it. I am already planning my exit strategy, because otherwise they&#x27;ll take my phone number with it. and this is not trivial, we are talking about buying another phone (hopefully it will make it until the next-gen iphone with N3E) and paying for two lines for a couple of months. This is a pain in the ass for me.and google has already embrace-extend-extinguished the standard - their encryption implementation is proprietary and they&#x27;ve refused to let anyone interop, so essentially they have put themselves as imessage 2.0 but with google as the man in the middle this time. reply redhale 12 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be mistaken: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone&#x2F; reply tedd4u 13 hours agorootparentprevApple says they will implement RCS in 2024.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;23964171&#x2F;apple-iphone-rc... reply legobmw99 13 hours agorootparentWithout end to end encryption, because that is not part of the standard, as the grandparent comment said reply nicoburns 13 hours agorootparentprevIMO they should also be made to open up.

This set is extracted from 東海道分間絵図 (A Charted Map of the Tōkaidō). Whereas Gansai was ink and watercolor washes, this set is firmly in Hishikawa’s wheelhouse, a solid example of the ukiyo-e (浮世絵) woodblock work he made famous. This is a great set to construct your perfect Japan-inspired fantasy map covering a range of objects. Moronobu Gansai: A 17th Century Brush Set The first set in a planned duo is based on 東海道分間絵図 or Map of the Tōkaidō, a 17th-century watercolor map painted enormous scrolls by Hishikawa Moronobu. My most extensive set to date, over 1140 brushes, allows for the creation of works that feel more like picturesque landscapes that stand apart from typical fantasy maps. It is a unique approach to any fantasy map and perfect if you’re looking to create something that evokes an elegant Edo-Period style. Kensett: A 19th Century Urban Cartography Brush Set This is a unique urban cartography brush set based on Thomas Kensett’s “A plan of the town of New Haven” from 1806, based on James Wadsworth’s survey from 1748. It’s a comprehensive set with hundreds of houses, their lots, land, inhabitants, and various outbuildings. The style is charming and unique and perfect if you’re looking to map a village or a small town. Grüninger Compass Wind Brush Set This small set of twelve wind directions and a large globe is taken from Claudius Ptolemy’s geographical account published in 1525 for Johann Koberger by Johann Grüninger. The link above will download the file. (I didn’t announce this one with a blog post.) They are included as a Photoshop .abr file and as thirteen individual .pngs labeled by their direction. A handy addition to zhuzh up any fantasy maps. Zuodong: A Free 17th Century Cartography Brush Set This cartography brush set was extracted from four woodblock print maps coming from 廣東輿圖 (Map of Guangdong), an atlas and gazetteer depicting the various settlements and locations of the Chinese province of Guangdong during the Qing dynasty. It’s a fantastic collection with mountain-profile signs and symbols rendered in a Chinese-calligraphy aesthetic, but the rough woodblock printing technique gives the whole set a lived-in feel that helps it stand out. Ishikawa: A Free 17th Century Cartography Brush Set This is an enormous cartography brush set based on 日本海山潮陸圖 (Map of Sea, Mountain, Tide, and Land of Japan) by Ishikawa Ryūsen depicting the Japanese islands of Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshu during the Edo Period. For the most part, this is a hill-profile set with its unique style from the almost kanji-inspired flora to the elegant, calligraphic mountains. Still, more modern iconographic touches for settlements and points of interest exist. We end up with a fascinating hybrid style, not precisely hill-profile and yet not thoroughly “modern.” A great set that will help your fantasy maps stand apart. All my Map Tools will always be free.

Click here to learn how. de Fer Cartography: A Free 18th Century Brush Set This is an extensive cartography brush set based on the first plate of de Fer’s Le Cours de Missisipi, ou de St. Louis, an early 18th-century map depicting headwaters of the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes region. The source map isn’t as accurate as other maps from the period. Still, like his other work, de Fer’s artistic ability shines as he goes into extensive detail, creating a unique art piece with signs and symbols that stand apart from others and work exceptionally well for fantasy maps. de Fer Battlefield: A Free 17th Century Brush Set This extensive battlefield brush set is based on de Fer’s Le Combat de Leuze ou de la Catoire, a late 17th-century map depicting the fortification of the Belgium city of Leuze-en-Hainaut in 1691, and the Battle of Leuze, a French calvary victory from the Nine Years’ War. It’s full of the sort of stuff that makes these maps fascinating, charging cavalry units, stalwart pike men, soldiers, explosions, battles, villages, and more. Perfect to add a bit of narrative drama to your fantasy maps. de Fer Settlement: A Free 18th Century Brush Set This 18th-century settlement set is the first in a series coming from French cartographer Nicolas de Fer who eventually became the official geographer to the Spanish and the French court. This set comes from La Banlieue De Paris, an 18th-century map of the homes, towns, and villages that filled the Parisian countryside. Filled with lots of interesting little details, this set should work alongside any of my previous brush sets and allow a bit of variety to your fantasy map settlements. Hyacinth: A Free 19th Century Mountain Brush Set This mountain-focused set is my first taken from 19th-Century sources, and as one would imagine, it’s a hybrid of more modern styles paired with older topographical landforms. Based on an 1828 map of the road from Lhasa, Tibet, to Chengdu, China. The source was created by the archimandrite monk Nikita Bichurin who took on the monastic name “Hyacinth”—hence the name. This set serves as another transitional example of cartographic evolution. One can see the hill profile approach to elevation, but the landforms are beginning to adopt some of the aspects commonly found in hachure relief—a refreshingly different approach to landforms. Ende: A Free Littoral Edger Little different from my other sets, Ende is a 17th/18th century hatch-style paint-in littoral edger for your fantasy maps allowing you to quickly paint in your coastlines. Ende will work best when placed on its own layer behind an opaque “landmass” layer. It’s designed to be a base point. I recommend adding noise, applying some texture, or using subtle distortion to rough them up. That way, they’ll fit whatever aesthetic you’re looking to achieve. Homann: A Free 18th Century Cartography Brush Set This set comes from L’Isle de Cadix du Detroit de Gibraltar, a 1788 map of the Strait of Gibraltar, by Johann Baptist Homann, a prolific German geographer, cartographer, and wig-haver. The OG map it comes from is pretty unique as it mixes many different styles. So the set is also a bit eclectic. It’s partly a battlefield set with fortresses, defensive positions, towns, camps, and unit locations. It’s partly cartographic, with mountains, flora, and even agriculture represented. It’s partly nautical with anchorages and sounding markers. It should work well alongside my other sets. Zatta: A Free 18th Century Cartography Brush Set This fuzzy-caterpillar/hachure set comes from L’estremadura Di Portogallo, a 1775 map of southern Portugal created by Italian cartographer Antonio Zatta as part of his Atlante Novissimo. This transitory set, sitting somewhere between hill-profile and top-down hachure design, is perfect for flintlock fantasy, steampunk, or anything that sits on that historical edge between the 18th and 19th centuries. All my Map Tools will always be free. Want to help support this work? Click here to learn how. Janssonius: A Free 17th Century Cartography Brush Set This is a topographical brush set with a nautical focus based on Johannes Janssonius’ 1650 nautical chart of the Bay of Bengal. Along with the standard symbols of settlements, flora, and landforms, I’ve also made sure to incorporate a whole host of maritime signs—rocks, sounding marks, shallows, and a whole bunch more. It’ll be handy if you’re telling a tale set on the high seas or want to add a flash of authenticity to the coasts of your map. Vischer: A Free 17th Century Cartography Brush Set A topographic set based on the Archiducatus Austriae inferioris, an incredibly detailed map of lower Austria created by Georg Matthäus Vischer in 1697. The unique style features a few stylistic touches that help set it apart. Hills do double duty serving as forests, and most of the cities, towns, and villages are rendered quite intricately, giving each its own unique look. Braun: A 16th Century Urban Cartography Brush Set The brushes within this set are based on the incredible work of Georg Braun taken from his Civitates orbis terrarum—easily one of the most significant volumes of cartographic antiquity featuring bird’s eye maps of over five hundred and forty Renaissance cities. The detail and density represented in these symbols give an extra layer of texture and are perfect for the right fantastical city map. Ogilby: A Free 17th Century Road Atlas Brush Set Taken from John Ogilby’s 1675 book Britannia, Volume the First, this set allows the creator to recreate a road atlas from the 17th century in stunning detail, placing the traveler’s experience front and center. With over 800 brushes, this is my most extensive set to date and useful for a variety of projects. Several bonus downloads are also available, as well. Van der Aa: An 18th Century Cartography Brush Set This set is based on a map by Dutch cartographer and publisher Pieter Van der Aa. It’s a beautifully rendered version of the Mingrelia region of northwest Georgia. While not as extensive as other sets, the size of the map allowed for larger brushes that helps highlight the uniqueness of each symbol. Gomboust: A 17th Century Urban Cartography Brush Set My first brush set focusing on creating realistic maps for fantastical urban environments! Gomboust is a huge set, and its symbols are extracted from Jacques Gomboust’s 1652 map of Paris. The style is detailed yet quirky, isometric yet off-kilter, and it brings a lot of personality to a project. Harrewyn: An 18th Century Cartography Brush Set Based on Eugene Henry Fricx’s “Cartes des Paysbas et des Frontieres de France,” this set leans into its 1727 gothic styling and its focus on the developed rather than the natural. It’s hauntingly familiar yet strikingly different. All my Map Tools will always be free. Want to help support this work? Click here to learn how. Popple: A Free 18th Century Cartography Brush Set This set has quickly become a favorite, and it’s perfect for a wide variety of projects. The brushes are taken from 1746’s A Map of the British Empire in America by Henry Popple, and it has a fresh style that does a fantastic job capturing the wildness of a frontier. Plus, it has swamps! And we know swamps have become a necessity in fantasy cartography. Donia: A Free 17th Century Settlement Brush Set While not my most extensive set (a little over one hundred brushes), Donia boasts one of the more unique takes on settlements from the 17th century. If you’re looking for flora, I suggest checking out other sets, but if you want to pay attention to your map’s cities, towns, castles, churches, towers, forts, and even fountains, this is the right set for you. Blaeu: A Free 17th Century Cartography Brush Set Based on Joan Blaeu’s Terræ Sanctæ—a 17th-century tourist map of the Holy Land—this set includes a ton of unique and varied signs as well as a large portion of illustrative cartouches that can add a flair of authenticity to any fantasy map. Elegant and nuanced, everything works within a system, but nearly every sign is unique. Aubers: An 18th Century Cartography Brush Set An 18th Century brush set based on a map from 1767 detailing the journey of François Pagès, a French naval officer, who accompanied the Spanish Governor of Texas on a lengthy exploration through Louisiana, Texas, and Mexico. A unique southwestern set with a few interesting deviations—including three volcanos! L’Isle: An 18th Century Battlefield Brush Set A departure from the norm, this set is based on the Plan Batalii map, which was included in a special edition of The First Atlas of Russia in 1745. A detailed view of a battle during the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. Canon! Units! Battles! Perfect for mapping out the combat scenarios in your fantasy stories. Widman: A 17th Century Cartography Brush Set A 17th Century brush set based on the work of Georgio Widman for Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi’s atlas published in 1692. A fantastic example of Cantelli da Vignola’s influence and a robust set for any fantastic map. This workhorse of antique map brush sets is perfect for nearly any setting. Walser: An 18th Century Cartography Brush Set An 18th Century brush set based on the work of Gabriel Walser with a focus on small farms and ruins and a solid set of mountains and hills. This is a great brush set to see how Vignola’s influence persisted across generations. It was etched over 80 years after the Widman set, but you’ll find a few familiar symbols within. All my Map Tools will always be free. Want to help support this work? Click here to learn how. Lumbia: A Sketchy Cartography Brush Set A sketchy style brush set I drew myself that focuses on unique hills and mountains and personal customizability. My attempt at trying to channel the sort of map a barkeep would draw for a band of hearty adventurers. It includes extra-large brushes for extremely high-resolution maps. Lehmann: A Hatchure Brush Set Named after Austrian topographer Johann Georg Lehmann, creator of the Lehmann hatching system in 1799, this is a path-focused brush set designed for Adobe Illustrator that attempts to capture the hand-drawn style of unique 19th Century hachure-style mountains. Coronelli: A Free 17th Century Compass Rose Brush Set A small set of six compass roses in various languages taken from the first atlas volume of the Atlante Veneto by… you guessed it, Vincenzo Coronelli! The link above will download the file. (I didn’t announce this one with a blog post.) They are included as a Photoshop .abr file and as six individual .pngs labeled by their language.

It&#x27;s not just two straight lines in a corner.So, anyway, one of the brushes in these sets might be those mountain icons.Then, when making your mountain range on your map, you select the \"mountain top brush\", and then \"stamp\" mountains in an area using the glyph. So, in that sense, it&#x27;s not a \"brush\" per se, something that you actually use for brush strokes. Rather, its an iconography that you can place on your map.That&#x27;s a trivial example of how these can be used. They may well be more sophisticated than that. reply ornornor 16 hours agorootparentSo it’s really more like a physical rubber stamp of sorts that you can scale up or down but that will otherwise always look the same?I also know very little about this and the “brush” denomination really confuses me. reply crtified 12 hours agorootparentIn traditional painting, since hundreds or thousands of years ago, many drawing techniques relied heavily upon using different physical brushes. The properties of each different brush would make certain tasks easier for the painter.In more modern times, as computer-based drawing evolved, that same principle became a basic feature of drawing applications - that is, the ability to change between different (virtual) &#x27;brushes&#x27;, each with different characteristics, such as shape, but also intensity and other factors which make the artist&#x27;s job both easier and more nuanced.In a way, your reduction of the idea to \"a set of rubber stamps of sorts\" is true, in the same way that a physical brush is equally \"a stamp of sorts\", if the artist chooses to use that brush in a suitably monotonous stamping action. But in digital art (as in physical art) the total picture is more about the skilful wielding of myriad tools and techniques, through multiple steps and recombinations.To bring in another analogy - every wood worker uses basically the same tools, the basic claw hammer shape hasn&#x27;t changed in a long time, the basic screw drivers, drill bits, etc. The same set of rubber stamps, in a way. Is that a constraint upon creativity and uniqueness? Perhaps, but not meaningfully. reply ornornor 3 hours agorootparentThank you, this helped. reply nonethewiser 16 hours agorootparentprevReading a bit more, I think “brush” is being used in the context of photoshop.

So it seems like you want a tilemap editor that includes a lot of assets from permissively licensed content?That&#x27;s a bit of a taller order than the first glance because you would necessarily need to split the free packages into tiles. Feels like the better move would be for someone to just make tilesets of these brushes, and then just use an already-existing tilemap editor for the rest of the functionality.But if it&#x27;s worth anything, I agree that both a simple map editor using the brushes for blitting onto a canvas, and a tilemap editor that defaults to these permissively licensed assets should be pretty easy to put together. The former is more aligned with things I&#x27;m already working on, which is why I asked. reply anigbrowl 13 hours agorootparentprevOr you could stop tooling and optimizing, have some fun with a nice thing someone already made. replystarkparker 13 hours agoparentprevThe linked #NoBadMaps blog post describes some of this, but ultimately there&#x27;s very little to it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kmalexander.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;27&#x2F;nobadmaps&#x2F;> Using my brushes is easy: you load them in Photoshop, create a document, and place what you want where you want it with a few mouse clicks. Point-and-click. There’s very little drawing, no scanning, nothing complicated. In fact using any of my brush sets you can make super cool maps in minutes. That’s intentional.The best way to get started is to just grab a piece of paper, scribble a weird shape on it, and sketch on it where you think certain features go. Everything after that is an implementation detail that tools like these brushes help to solve.If you&#x27;ve never made maps in any tool that applies symbols or uses \"brushes\" like this, play around with something like Inkarnate[1] or Wonderdraft[2] first. It&#x27;s a web tool for fantasy mapping with a basic free version and similar palette of brush-like features that you can paint onto maps, but strips down a lot of the non-mapping tooling and interface that you&#x27;d wade through in something like Photoshop or GIMP.Inkarnate should help give you a hands-on idea of what&#x27;s possible, and it might be all you want or need out of the process (in which case its \"pro\" subscription is about $25&#x2F;year). If you want more flexibility or power after playing around with it, then it&#x27;s a matter of learning related features in the tool you have or want to use - looking up tutorials on Photoshop brushes, custom brushes in GIMP, brushes and bundles in Krita, etc.They all work just differently enough to not have a blanket recommendation. These brush packs are in the somewhat well-supported ABR format, but each tool that supports them also has different features for configuring how they&#x27;re applied. The packs are also available as piles of PNG images that you can place manually or make into brushes yourself, if you&#x27;re so motivated.Once you get a feel for \"painting\" symbols as brushes, it&#x27;s mostly up to you how you apply them. You might like to draw the outlines of landmasses and bodies of water on paper, scan them, and then apply the features with the brushes. For instance, when I was starting out with mapping I followed Jonathan Roberts&#x27;s blog[3], which steps through and explains a lot of his process for different types of maps and mapping features from a very basic level of understanding. Each brush set here also includes an \"in use\" section that links to other brushes the artist used to apply certain effects, like watercolors and textures, in the sample maps.Maybe you prefer to draw the landmasses in the same tool that you&#x27;re using the brushes, or maybe you&#x27;re more comfortable in a different drawing tool. (Some people even use GIS tools to draw maps in a data format transformable to different projections, but that&#x27;s not a great starting point.) Maybe you&#x27;d even prefer to use a random landmass generator to skip the drawing step entirely.The brushes ultimately exist to save you the tedium of filling in those spaces with repetitive shapes like mountains, tress, buildings, etc., that are all slightly different each time while also maintaining a consistent aesthetic style across the map.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inkarnate.com&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wonderdraft.net&#x2F;[3]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fantasticmaps.com&#x2F; reply noxa 13 hours agoprevbeautiful - also recommend his novels: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kmalexander.com&#x2F;home&#x2F; reply mhd 12 hours agoparentYeah, I read the first one a while ago and really enjoyed the world building.

The blog post is correct, but IMO the core problem itself is too far gone to be fixable. Delegated auth across the internet is an absolute mess. I have personally spoken with plenty of Google and Microsoft engineers about this, so I can guarantee they are all already well aware of this class of problems, but changing the behavior now would just break too many existing services and decades-old corporate login implementations.The \"fix\" at this point is simply – if you are using \"Sign in with XYZ\" for your site, do not trust whatever email address they send you. Never grant the user any special privileges based on the email domain, and always send a confirmation email from your own side before marking the address as verified in your database. All the major OAuth providers have updated their docs to make this explicit, as the post itself points out. In fact I&#x27;m surprised there even was a payout for this. reply krooj 17 hours agoparentI feel as though this is a consequence of organizations not really understanding how complex the space truly is. The way I&#x27;ve watched OAuth2 + OIDC get adopted in various companies was never from a security-first perspective; rather, it&#x27;s always sold as a \"feature\": login with x, etc. Even when there are moves to make flows more secure - PKCE, for example - you end up playing a game of \"whack-a-mole\" with various platforms doing shitty things in terms of cookie sharing, redirect handling, and the like. The fundamentals of 3-legged OAuth2 are sound and there&#x27;s tons of prior art (CAS comes to mind), but the OpenID Foundation should be tarred and feathered for the shitty way they market and sold OIDC. reply treve 11 hours agorootparentOpenID Connect and all its extensions are so high in complexity and scope. The documents themselves are massive and written in a quite hard to understand form. I&#x27;ve implemented many protocols and RFCs so I feel I have some experience.Because OpenID Connect and OAuth2 are so closely related, I worry that some of this overengineering is making it&#x27;s way back into new OAuth2 extensions.I&#x27;m worried both will eventually collapse under their own weight, creating a market for a new, simpler incumbent and setting us back another 10 years as all this has to get reinvented again.My outside impression is that the OIDC folks are highly productive with really strong domain knowledge and experience, but they&#x27;re not strong communicators or shepherds with a strong enough vision.The sad thing is that this is the second thing with the OpenID name that&#x27;s going down this path. The original OpenID concept was great but also collapsed due to their over-engineering. reply krooj 4 hours agorootparentAgree - you only need to look at things like the hybrid flows to see where things fall apart: why would you issue an id_token that contains user information to a client which hasn&#x27;t yet fully authenticated itself via a code-to-token exchange with passing it&#x27;s client_id + secret? If you look at certain implementations, such as Auth0, you&#x27;ll find that they actually POST that token back at the redirect_uri, since, a) it&#x27;s at least registered against the client; b) it&#x27;s not subject to capture as easily.

But unfortunately it&#x27;s also highly phishable. reply johnmaguire 13 hours agorootparentCan you explain how you would phish a user with a magic link? Since the service is generating a one-time code, and sending it directly to the user&#x27;s email inbox, I am not sure how an attacker would intercept the code. reply apitman 12 hours agorootparentThe attack works by getting the user onto a page you control that looks like a slack page that says, \"we need you to confirm your email\". User enters their email and gets a legitimate email from slack. User enters the code on the original phishing page and the attacker gets a link that lets them log in as the user. I built this exact exploit for slack in a few hours. It was trivial.I&#x27;ve never seen a foolproof way to mitigate this. Best you can do is big warnings in the email telling the user never to enter the code anywhere but slack.com. You can also do fancy stuff like comparing IP addresses to make sure they&#x27;re from the same region but the attacker can also do fancy stuff like detect where your IP is from and use a VPN to get an IP in the same area. reply archi42 11 hours agorootparentThe foolproof way is to not send codes as a 2FA (be it mail, SMS or whatever). There is always a risk that the user fails to verify where they&#x27;re putting that code. Instead use something that verifies the domain without relying on the user, e.g. U2F or passkeys.In that case the user needs to be fooled to sent the physical device or passkey-app-backup to the attacker. This is much more suspicious and needs a much worse fool than someone entering a code after they already entered their user+password.If you know that the user uses the same browser to open links sent via mail as they use for their login: For the 2FA step, set a cookie with some unique value on your login domain and sent the user a mail with a link. Opening the link only finishes the login and starts a valid session if that unique cookie is present. This makes it harder for an attacker, since they need to inject that cookie into the victims browser, which means they need to find an XSS-style exploit. Of course you then want to reduce the attack surface by putting the login function on a subdomain of its own.And obviously this fails if the user is about to login e.g. on their personal computer and then tries to verify the session on their company phone. This can be good or bad, depending on the scenario.TBF, I wish some companies would use even that basic code-by-whatever 2FA. I&#x27;ve seen cases which have like 5 different domains, all with various logins that customers and employees use. Want to phish them? Just register another domain that looks similar enough to the others and sent some mails. But then there are still services limiting the password length to something like 16, so I think we will still have plenty of work... reply apitman 10 hours agorootparentPasskeys are cool, but not widely deployed yet. Also, there&#x27;s currently no way to express \"give X identity Y access on Z server\", unless X identity already has a passkey set up with the server. This is a non starter for decentralized networks with lots of federated and self-hosted servers. This use case is trivial with email. reply johnmaguire 10 hours agorootparentprevThanks - but this sounds like an email 2FA flow, not a magic link.A magic link is a link a user clicks in their browser, that lands them on the appropriate service, where the one-time code is part of the URL. The service consumes the token and provides the user with a (first factor) authentication token.In other words, the email doesn&#x27;t display a code which they could go paste into the attacker&#x27;s page. Though they may still need to perform a 2FA flow following the magic link flow (and this portion is still phishable!)Your critique is definitely valid for most forms of 2FA (email, SMS, and TOTP.) reply apitman 9 hours agorootparentYou are correct that this mitigates the security problems.However, the method you&#x27;re describing has fallen out of favor, in large part because mobile email apps often use a built-in browser that doesn&#x27;t share cookies with the system browser. This creates several confusing UX problems. You also can&#x27;t use a logged in device to log in a new device, unless you implement something like QR login which is also phishable.Slack for example used to work the way you describe but now uses emailed codes for 1FA login. reply SgtBastard 12 hours agorootparentprevAs with sibling comment, what threat vector do you see phishing risk with?A race condition where the phishing email lands first, user clicks link to g00gle.com, gets a convincing message that they also need to present username and password? reply apitman 12 hours agorootparentSee response to sibling reply SgtBastard 9 hours agorootparentThank you - as sibling also mentioned, what you&#x27;re describing in isn&#x27;t a magic link but a standard TOTP&#x2F;HOTP delivered via email which absolutely is phishable in the manner you described.Magic link is a process where you enter your email address and the service sends you an email that contains a clickable hyperlink that contains a cryptographically strong, short-lived nonce in the URI that is used as a proof-of-possession factor (the email account) to authenticate users. reply apitman 7 hours agorootparentSee third cousin replyMacha 10 hours agorootparentprevI hate this experience.

The relying party (the system wanting to authenticate the user) just treats sub as an opaque string (unique within that issuer). The `email` claim is just the \"End-User&#x27;s preferred e-mail address.\" (And … \"The RP MUST NOT rely upon this value being unique\" … the end user&#x27;s email might change … for whatever reason the end-user, or their IDP, might prefer. Also, any other IDP might claim that email as the preferred email, potentially truthfully, too.)The docs, however, seem to be discussing the notion of the relying party&#x27;s \"user\" object. For that … use a UUID, an auto-incrementing int, some artificial key, totally up to you. Link that user object with the (iss, sub) tuple above. But you should consider¹ whether user can adjust their authentication method with whatever you&#x27;re building: e.g., if I change OIDC providers … can I adjust in your RP what IDP my account is connected to? (Same as I might need to update an email, or a password in a more classic login system.)(¹The answer is also not always \"yes\", either; I work with a system where the IDP is pretty much fixed, because it&#x27;s a party we trust. All signins have to come from that specific IDP, because again, the trust relationship. But, on the open web where I&#x27;m just building Kittenstagram, you don&#x27;t care whether the user is signing in with Hooli&#x27;s IDP, Joja&#x27;s, etc.) reply yardstick 13 hours agorootparentThis is how we do it- sub+issuer associated with an account in our system. The user is issued a username for our system, they enter that then they are presented with the login options (eg password, IDP providers, etc). This also forces the customer organisation to specify exactly who they want to have access (which in a org with 10k+ employees of which only a few dozen need to login to us, that’s a good thing).Plus this approach allows multiple accounts each associated with the same IDP account. Useful if the user needs multiple accounts for whatever reason. reply jbmsf 12 hours agorootparentprevI get it, but this is also, frankly, terrible.

That ship, as it were, has already sailed. reply saurik 17 hours agorootparentThose providers already don&#x27;t use email addresses as their primary key: their login APIs all allow you to get access to an underlying ID of the user (I say \"an\" as, in the case of Facebook at least, they no longer give you the global one but map you to an application-specific one, to prevent 3rd party apps doing correlation). reply smeyer 14 hours agorootparentprevI changed my last name when I got married, and at the time I had a work email address that looked like oldlastname@company.com on the company&#x27;s Google Workspace. Given that oldlastname was no longer my name, I changed my email address to newlastnmae@company.com.This worked fine in Google services and some of the many work applications using Google for auth, but some of them were using the email address as a global identifier in a way that broke down when I changed my name. The services that migrated successfully were using a more stable identifier that persisted despite the address change. reply kagakuninja 16 hours agorootparentprevI have a comcast email named after an old movie monster.

It has oid, but if you want to support n-providers with just a login field and not a sign in with n button, than you have a problem. Or should the user know its entry lid and insert it into the username field? Most of the time you use an email and what Microsoft does in c# and their docs mean that you connect that with the oid. And also that’s why it’s stupid that Microsoft and google do not treat the email&#x2F;preferred_username identifier that well. Because everybody changes the oidc spec reply frenchyatwork 13 hours agorootparentIs Microsoft&#x27;s sub claim unstable?I think you might have misunderstood the point. Miscellaneous claims like email&#x2F;preferred_username shouldn&#x27;t be used to identify 3rd party logins. Apart from not necessarily being unique, they&#x27;re also vulnerable to change. Changing your email shouldn&#x27;t make you lose access to all your accounts. The point of the sub claim is that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s unique and stable. reply merb 12 hours agorootparentNo the sub is not unstable, it’s just the sub is unique per client_id.yeah I know that. We basically do both. You create the account with the email&#x2F;upn but we also save the oid and than we use the oid for matching. If the email changes we update it. If you started your account without the provider and than somebody configured domain+tenant id we first match via upn and after the first login it will use oid. User still uses upn to start the flow but the matching uses oid. But we are only dealing with b2b tough. And we have our own login site that of course needs a upn as well, thus the upn of Microsoft is the same as ours. If you change the upn on the Microsoft side you need to change the login upn on our side aswell. Another solution would‘ve been to have a unique logon site, in this case it would be possible to directly go to the IdP, but it does not matter that much with login_hint. reply sirius87 18 hours agorootparentprevCurious to hear answers to this too.

I think email is generally a solid identifier, and would be curious to know why they needed to change theirs. reply kagakuninja 16 hours agorootparentBecause comcast subscribers lose their email address when switching email providers, and the address becomes available to other subscribers.This happened to me, and I cannot use my comcast email with google services, and some others.

And yes I know domains need to be much easier for the average person to use (and avoid accidentally losing). That&#x27;s one reason I run a domain registrar, to try and make this more accessible.Once someone has their own domain, it also opens up things such as hosting your own IdP (or paying a small monthly fee to have someone else host it for you) and sidestepping email entirely. reply JohnFen 11 hours agorootparent> This is solvable by using a more stable email provider, ideally with your own domain.Sure, but requiring ordinary people to do this is essentially a nonstarter. The whole point of SSO is to minimize user friction.

This guidance just pushes responsibility down onto application developers and I would expect most of them to either do nothing or implement guidance inconsistently.The right thing here is to offer APIs that fit the needs of the applications that will use them with as little extra responsibility as possible.In this case, I&#x27;d have hoped that Google would set email_verified to false so that applications (or downstream IDPs) would know that they had to do extra verification. reply clintonb 9 hours agorootparentThe OIDC spec does provide a stable identifier, and Google implements it properly. My Google Workspace address will always be verified, so your solution doesn’t apply. Changing my email address at Google itself won’t unverify it. Also, you’re still relying on developers to read the docs and properly implement the spec. reply jbmsf 6 hours agorootparentI think you missed the point. No application developer wants to use \"sub\" as the identifier; they want to use \"email\" or \"phone\" because these a) are actual ways to message a human and b) do not require a deep understanding of any technical spec to do the intuitively obvious thing.I am not saying that my solution works today. I am saying that is a completely natural thing to want and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work or that we&#x27;re even having this discussion is failure of the people who designed and implemented these specs. reply clintonb 1 hour agorootparentI don’t see it as a failure of the spec, but developers failing to read said spec. By the way, I’m a developer who does want a stable ID for users authenticating via third-parties.

For example, I run a free login provider[0], and it works by validating an identity with a 4th party identity provider (IdP) either with upstream OIDC or direct email, and creating a privacy screen between the app and that IdP (ie so Google can&#x27;t track every app you&#x27;re logging into). The fact that you can bring your own email to Google means you can get the security and UX of Google OIDC with the privacy of email + password, with the huge caveat that now you have to trust LastLogin instead of Google.

If you&#x27;ve got a contractor working for Business A and Business B, both who create a user account in their authentication service for them, then as a SaaS platform, you can&#x27;t match their e-mail address to a single B2B customer.Secondly, there&#x27;s the really obvious thing that e-mail addresses change. Businesses get bought, change name, go through mergers, etc. etc., and people&#x27;s names change too (marriage, divorce, because they feel like it).I found implementing SSO to be really challenging for a start-up. Getting it correct is hard, and you need to have a good understanding of the general concepts and OIDC and OAuth2 before trying to put it into use. Auth0 have a good book. If you don&#x27;t understand this, then you&#x27;ll probably end up doing something like implementing password grant auth everywhere and leave your application insecure. reply k8svet 15 hours agoparentSometimes reading articles like these are a good well to alleviate any accumulating imposter syndrome. \"Oh, I&#x27;m interfacing with a third party system for something that represents an abstract actor. it better have a stable, non-stringy reliable identifier\".

Outside of the support system&#x2F;zendesk and unattended old domain methods identified I can&#x27;t make a new Google account for whatever@mydomain.com without being asked to verify it - so what&#x27;s the real likelihood of abuse? reply JeremyNT 13 hours agoparentThe idea is that you do this in advance, at a time when you have legitimate access, then you later lose that access.So say you have a egamirorrim@mydomain.com google account legitimately. You can use an alias like egamirorrim+woopsie@mydomain.com to create a new google account with a verified email address, resulting in \"log in with google\" google sending an email claim egamirorrim+woopsie@mydomain.com.Then, later, mydomain.com fires you. You can no longer log in with the real egamirorrim@mydomain.com associated account, as it was disabled by an administrator. However you can still log into the new google account, egamirorrim+woopsie@mydomain.com , since it&#x27;s not associated with your organization.The thing is, afaict this then only becomes a problem if the provider is doing authz based exclusively off of the email claim. I&#x27;ve used OIDC in the past and you are not supposed to grant access to resources based on parsing text in email addresses claim!I can understand why the blog post author found this counterintuitive, but as they note the docs even warn against doing this.The blog post goes on to make this statement:> Most of the service providers I tested did not use HD, they used the email claim.... OK, well what are they \"using\" it for? Does this trick actually work on any real world services?

Steps to reproduce? reply superkuh 17 hours agoprevA microcosm. There is no such thing as OAuth2. OAuth2 is just a way for megacorps to implement their own arbitrary&#x2F;proprietary auth systems. It is a toolkit for making auth systems, not an auth system. So we end up in a world where oauth2 was supposed to be a standard, but instead every megacorp has their own incompatible implementation. And sure, people will dev for the megacorp use cases... but that just means the \"standard\" is now whatever google does&#x2F;etc.And they all have their own little bugs like this. We should go back to oauth1. It was a real standard. Not a toolkit for making standards. reply kevindamm 15 hours agoparentI wouldn&#x27;t really call this a bug, more like an unfortunate side effect of combining these particular components: domain names that can change ownership, BYO email (as backup email & email provenance), the liberal allowance of plus-aliases (which I&#x27;m sure someone somewhere is claiming a business need or they would have killed it long ago), and service implementers not reading the documentation (or largely copying solutions from a video or example with cut corners for brevity&#x2F;simplicity, likely to facilitate its easy consumption).If I were designing a circuit with a few PCB components and needed to introduce resistors and transistors as appropriate for the voltage and current needs of the device .. would you expect me to read the data sheet or just guess it from a simpler example and run with it? In a lot of cases the circuit would still work, or it would after a few bench tests and a bit of probing. But maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be as efficient and a component would short out leading to low MTF and sad customers. Worst case scenario maybe combusting batteries and real harm. Now ask yourself, is it really the PCB modules&#x27; manufacturers fault that the device fails prematurely? Or is the device manufacturer the one responsible for reading the data sheet?I don&#x27;t typically hold all software to such rigorous expectations but when it deals with authentication and authorization I would expect service owners to be thorough.TFA even says that the issue doesn&#x27;t exist if the docs are followed. Alphabet did at least acknowledge there&#x27;s a weakness there by granting the bounty, maybe they&#x27;ll provide some controls for company administrators to allowlist&#x2F;rejectlist plus-aliases or nonexistent roles, or maybe restrict the migration of Apps-affiliated emails to non-org claims? (My guess is they&#x27;re measuring the impact of this, or prioritizing the measurement of impact, where priority is low because it is a problem with clients that assume email claims are more authoritative and permanent than they actually are).I suppose the definition of \"bug\" depends a lot on the definition of \"expected\" and who&#x27;s expecting, but I would assert it is not a deviation from intended behavior, at least, and not unexpected to those who grokked the docs. reply paulddraper 11 hours agoparentprevUm...okay?Is cross-provider compatibility related to this article about the security of Google OAuth2? reply AtNightWeCode 12 hours agoprevUsing emails like this is usually found during pen tests.

Not only that, but the retention is completely invisible to the account administrators.Needing the same level of access that an employee has in order to utilize it doesn&#x27;t make it less valuable. There are plenty of valuable bugs that can only be utilized from specific positions.

The recent Okta hack happened that way. reply agwa 12 hours agorootparentThe rogue accounts would show up in the administrative settings in the third-party apps, and they would stick out like a sore thumb because they&#x27;d have weird email addresses.

I assume the bulk of the bounties were paid by the service providers who failed to heed the warning in Microsoft&#x27;s documentation.Also, the Microsoft issue was far worse as it could be exploited by anyone; the Google issue requires a rogue employee or a misconfigured email ticketing system.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.descope.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;noauth reply thrdbndndn 19 hours agoparentprevFrom a practical perspective, they probably should \"match\" what black market values these exploits, and I surely wish they can give much higher bounties in general (and they for sure can afford!), but I don&#x27;t think they ethnically need to (so it&#x27;s not an insult in my view).Turning these exploits&#x2F;vulnerabilities to black market is not only immoral but also highly illegal, so the \"value\" is inflated due to these \"risk\" factors.

This includes leaking private information from these systems, and it applies even if the affected systems belong to private entities.

    "originLink": "https://fsfe.org/news/2023/news-20231220-01.sl.html",
    "originBody": "News Unblocking User Freedom: the right to use adblockers on: 2023-12-20 Companies increasingly aim to control how users interact with their content online, threatening user freedom. As more companies crack down on browser extensions and other third-party software used by internet users to customise their experiences, two recent German court cases on adblockers could strengthen the legal case for user control over technology. CC-BY-NC-SA by Rahak Advertisements are a part of our lives, including our digital ones. They are in the websites we browse, the search results we receive, and the online news we read. Tired of receiving so many ads, some users try to avoid them by installing an adblocker. But is this a legal practice? Is using adblockers an act of restricting market autonomy, or do they help achieve user freedom? Imagine a scenario where website owners hold copyright over their websites, including whatever ads they place, and could effectively sue for copyright infringement if users were to remove or suppress ads when visiting these websites. This hypothetical situation would enable any website copyright holder to use the legal system to stop any ordinary user on the internet who tries to bypass these ads. This would lead to an internet where unsolicited information and advertisements are imposed on users. Fortunately, recent court decisions have at least prevented this hypothetical from becoming a reality in Germany. Is it legal to use adblockers? The lawsuit in question Using an adblocker is the main way in which many internet users bypass ads and pop-ups when accessing websites. Adblockers usually come in the form of browser extensions and plugins that filter out unwanted ads for an ad-free internet browsing experience. As the use of these adblockers increases, some companies have begun considering whether it is legal for users to be able to block their ads. This was the case in Germany when Axel Springer SE (Axel Springer), one of Germany’s largest publishing companies, engaged in lawsuits against Eyeo GmbH (Eyeo), the creator of Adblock Plus (a Free Software adblocking tool licensed under the GPLv3). These lawsuits have resulted in a legal battle for user freedom and an open internet. In the case of Adblock Plus, ads are blocked according to filter rules maintained in a so-called “black list”, which users use as a default setting. The extension offers ad providers the possibility of having their ads excluded from this black list (and included in a “white list”) by complying with “acceptable advertising standards”, disclosing their annual turnover, and paying a sum to Eyeo. Users will only see ads that have been included in the white list, but they also have the option of blocking ads from both white and black lists altogether. Axel Springer filed several suits in Germany against Eyeo on the grounds that the Adblock Plus extension interfered with their business, alleging that by blocking its advertisements, Eyeo had engaged in anti-competitive measures. According to Axel Springer, Eyeo’s business model constituted: Targeted obstruction and aggressive business practice; and A violation of freedom of the press. The right not to be advertised to After ruling that the option to use adblockers is a decision that internet users should be able to make, the courts in Germany ruled that user rights not only include the freedom to express an opinion and to receive information, but also the rights to refrain from expressing an opinion and to refuse to receive imposed information. In doing so, the rulings considered a user’s interest in being spared from obtrusive advertising. Accordingly, internet users are simply exercising their right to not have certain forms of advertising displayed when visiting internet websites when they choose to make use of an adblocker. Adblock Plus’s business model, according to the courts, was therefore a marketable service offer which was not primarily aimed at impairing the competitive development of Axel Springer. In the opinion of the courts, Adblock Plus also does not directly interfere with the business, as users retain autonomy to do as they wish with the settings of the add-on after installation. Users can block or wish to see only the ads in the whitelist. Adblock Plus is therefore merely a product whose use is decided solely by the internet user. The HTML argument: does the use of adblockers constitute a modification of a computer program? Axel Springer also submitted an argument to the German courts that their websites would be protected under German copyright law as a copyrighted computer program, and that their HTML code would similarly be covered under this ambit because of the control components it included. Because of how Adblock Plus interacts with its website, Axel Springer therefore claimed that copies and adaptations of the code in its website were violations of copyright made without permission. In both the initial court ruling and the decision on the subsequent appeal in favour of Eyeo, the court disagreed with Axel Springer and held that the use of Adblock Plus solely affects the program flow through external commands, without altering the program’s essence or generating a changed version. Thus, the use of the extension results in a mere browser configuration carried out by users according to their preferences. The courts noted that internet users do not require permission from website owners when they want to make the website look better for themselves. Modern websites are made up of many separate parts that can be technically distinguished from each other, including text, images, and videos, as well as software that is embedded in the HTML page. For the courts, it wasn’t enough that these software components were used in the website’s HTML page to mean that the website itself was a protectable computer program. We can therefore infer that adblockers do not infringe upon a program’s protections. Downsides of the case Nevertheless, some aspects in the judgments are still not ideal in promoting the average user’s rights. While user freedom means that users are able to use the tools that they wish to when browsing the World Wide Web, the court nevertheless preserved Axel Springer’s right to exclude users with an activated adblocker from accessing its content. This can be understood as an approval on the use of adblock detection tools by companies like Axel Springer. Unfortunately, the court also mentioned that Axel Springer can convert its content into a paid access model, justifying this measure as an element inherent for competition. We fear that this tacit approval can result in paywalls and adblock detection tools becoming the basic standard on the internet. More importantly, tools to detect the use of adblockers go against Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive, which mandates that websites must seek consent before accessing or storing information about a user’s device. The EU commission has confirmed that, Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive is not just limited to cookies but ‘all types of information’ stored or accessed in the user’s terminal device. This applies to the storage by websites of scripts in users’ terminal equipment to detect if users have installed or are using adblockers. A win for user freedom? With many service providers and websites on the internet following the trend of restricting users with adblockers from accessing their services, these court decisions in Germany help build precedents that uphold and recognize principles of user freedom. Indeed, these decisions support the principles of a Next Generation Internet, including ensuring that internet users can make individual choices and exercise their freedom of expression, in ways in which they can freely develop and use new extensions and browser features to enhance their online experience and user control. Despite the steps forward for user control found in these judgments, they do not go as far as we would hope to secure user freedom when using the internet, and are still subject to appeals and therefore may not be final. We will keep an eye on the legal proceedings in this case and keep you updated when new developments occur. In the meantime, the court cases can be read on the Bundesgerichtshof and Landesgerichts websites.

This feels needlessly confrontational?Sure, yes, according to me. That was implied when I posted my opinion on here, a discussion forum where we share opinions.My opinion is that the ad-supported model itself, which doesn&#x27;t rely on having paying readers&#x2F;users, but rather on attracting said users to then be paid for showing them ads or collecting their data, has perhaps unintentionally created too low of a bar for entry (in hindsight) and as a result, the fierce competition for profit has led to user-hostile incentives in order to stay alive in such a crowded landscape.I think the low barrier to entry for putting up websites or creating content online are a net positive, for the record. I love that anyone can just put their content online and compete for an audience on merit (more or less), rather than needing some large monetary investment up front.But I also think the ad-supported monetize-the-shit-out-of-users model is a bad thing, and benefits from the same low barrier to entry.But you take the good with the bad I suppose. reply AlbertCory 9 hours agorootparent> This feels needlessly confrontationalif you make an assertion about there being \"too many\" of something, it begs for someone to ask how you know this.

I don’t think we should make ads illegal, but it would be preferable if all ad-supported sites would identify themselves as such and then link aggregators, search engines, or even web browsers could have an easy “don’t show links to ad supported sites” button.It really seems like a win-win. reply jefftk 7 hours agorootparentIt would be very easy for link aggregators and search engines categorize sites as ad-supported or not: load the page in a browser (which these sites often already do) with an ad blocker extension and see if it identifies anything. But my guess is they&#x27;re not interested in doing this, since it rules out a lot of valuable pages. For example, HN is ad-supported. reply awiejtlaijwr 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, ads are the business model. Ads make it possible to sell things that people don&#x27;t want to pay for. Newspapers and magazines wouldn&#x27;t be possible without ads. It&#x27;s been that way for literally centuries. But internet ads are definitely a new level of crazy. I&#x27;m conflicted about Youtube in particular because when you filter out all the social viral crap, Youtube is one of the greatest educational resources ever created by human beings. I can go search youtube for any subject imaginable and get broad and deep video instruction on the subject from dozens of different perspectives. In grad school when a professor did a terrible job of explaining a niche technical subject, I could go on Youtube and watch lectures from a variety of other professors. I can go to Youtube to learn how to cook, how to dance, how to build a wooden canoe with hand tools, so many amazing things.

I don&#x27;t know of a better way. reply dageshi 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a well understood part of human nature that it&#x27;s very difficult to charge for something you previously gave away for free.The vast majority of the web has been given away for free by being ad supported, that&#x27;s never going to roll back, the expectation has been set.Thankfully, the wider public might find ads irritating but they&#x27;d still prefer them over paying so ads aren&#x27;t going away anytime soon. reply izzydata 12 hours agorootparentI know it will never happen.

It&#x27;s the spying that elevates them from being incredibly annoying to being just plain evil. reply arp242 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not an ad problem, that&#x27;s a tracking problem.

Like I said, ads were viable in print, well before the internet.Justwould work, and has no tracking and is essential the same as print media ads (or those YouTube sponsors for that matter). While this would probably net in less income than e.g. the Google ad stuff, it&#x27;s completely viable and I&#x27;m sure there are people and companies doing something like that.But uBlock will block that, because it&#x27;s an adblocker and not a trackblocker, and that&#x27;s clearly an ad. That&#x27;s perfectly fine, but what I want is a trackblocker reply jefftk 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s pretty hard to do online ads without tracking because of how easy fraud is online. With newspaper, TV, and radio we put a bunch of effort into measuring the size of the audience, but those methods are far easier to subvert online.If I tell you jefftk.com has 10k daily active users so you should pay me $500 to put a banner on the top of my site, should you believe me? reply JohnFen 10 hours agorootparentprev> there is nothing preventing anyone from serving ads without trackingI&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s not done. reply arp242 9 hours agorootparentHow do you know?

My understanding of a transaction is that there needs to be a \"meeting of the minds\" - if I value what you want to give me more than the price you want, we have trade and everybody wins.Unfortunately the ad economy is closer to begging. The consumer doesn&#x27;t value what&#x27;s being provided and the provider somehow tries to guilt or force users into \"paying\". And overall everyone loses - the content provider doesn&#x27;t get the value they want for their content and the consumer doesn&#x27;t get something they value.

I realise that many others don’t share such militant views on this, but for me it’s non negotiable. reply belorn 7 hours agoparentprevThere is one major aspect that I find troubling with companies blocking users with an activated adblocker. It removes the illusion that they are providing a service without any expectation for payment.Tax law, at least where I live, is very explicit on this. If a company provide goods or services with the expectation of payment, be that as a good or service, then that transaction trigger value added tax. Free samples and gratis products do not trigger this, including those that has advertisement, because those do not have an expectation of payment.In general it is the company that is selling a product that must manage payment of value added tax to consumers within the country, and the government has soft blocked imports from companies when that tax has not been paid.I don&#x27;t know German law around value added tax so they might have different exemption rules.

If not, do you also think they should be required to serve all your requests while you dos them? reply foob 10 hours agoparentprevI mostly agree with this in principle, but an important point is that, when you squint, the technology behind blocking ad blockers starts looking very similar to the technology behind blocking web scrapers. If you&#x27;re capable of programmatically scraping content without a human user viewing ads, then you&#x27;re capable of displaying the content to a user without the ads. So any solution for preventing ad blocking implies that the content can&#x27;t be scraped programmatically.I know that web scrapers carry some negative connotations, but keep in mind that search engines like Google couldn&#x27;t possibly exist without web scraping. A world where you can&#x27;t block ads or scrape content for indexing is a world where only a few preordained companies have the ability to build search engines. Proposals like Web Environment Integrity (WEI) accomplish two goals for Google: they make ad blocking more difficult, and they kick down the ladder to prevent new innovative search engines from emerging. There are already many websites which only allow-list Google&#x27;s IPs for indexing, and I think we should be very hesitant about anything that could further entrench their monopoly on search even if we support content creators being compensated through ads. reply Bu9818 8 hours agorootparentI agree, I don&#x27;t even care about ads in specific.

More generally, I care about web scraping and being able to control the presentation of content: for internet archival, using a featureful video&#x2F;music player (mpv) or library like a local imageboard, utilities like user scripts to add features&#x2F;programatically do stuff, content blocking (filter rules for specific posts&#x2F;users), creating RSS feeds for notifications if the site doesn&#x27;t offer one, simpler&#x2F;faster frontends like invidious&#x2F;nitter, etc. reply franciscop 8 hours agoparentprev> Everything on the internet is expendable.

    "originBody": "Opinion December 21, 2023 8 min read How Two Pharmacists Figured Out That Decongestants Don’t Work A loophole in FDA processes means older drugs like the ones in oral decongestants weren’t properly tested. Here’s how we learned the most popular one doesn’t work By Randy Hatton Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride pills. Credit: GIPhotoStock/Getty Images Pharmaceuticals In 2005, federal law compelled retailers nationwide to move pseudoephedrine, sold as Sudafed, from over-the-counter (OTC) to behind it, so as to combat its use in making illicit methamphetamine. This move changed the formulas of cough and cold medicines in the U.S.. It also led me and my colleague Leslie Hendeles to prove that pseudoephedrine’s replacement, oral phenylephrine, was ineffective as a decongestant. We petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) twice, yet it took the agency more than a decade and a half to act on our findings. In September, an agency advisory panel finally agreed with our conclusion that this compound did little to quell congestion and recommended that products containing it be pulled from shelves. If FDA acts on this recommendation, oral phenylephrine could be the first OTC drug approved under the agency’s “monograph” process to be discontinued. But in the meantime, millions of people have been trusting the FDA’s OTC regulatory process to ensure that medications work, but instead have been wasting money for nearly two decades on ones that don’t. FDA regulation of OTC medications with older ingredients needs to change. In the process of figuring out that oral phenylephrine doesn’t work, we’ve also spotlighted a loophole in FDA’s regulatory process that must be fixed so that people can trust not just recent over-the-counter approvals, but historic ones as well. Once pseudoephedrine was moved behind the counter in the 2000s, that left phenylephrine as the only remaining oral decongestant sold on the shelves of pharmacies, grocery stores, convenience stores and other retail outlets. Makers of oral decongestants and cold remedies reformulated their products to contain phenylephrine, sold as Sudafed PE, among others, instead of pseudoephedrine. Phenylephrine products went from few to many. I learned that customers did not recognize that these products had been reformulated. Consumers complained to their pharmacists when Sudafed PE did not work like the “old” Sudafed. Those pharmacists contacted me at the University of Florida (UF) drug information service, a laboratory for doctor of pharmacy students that teaches them how to receive, research and answer drug-related questions. They asked us: Does oral phenylephrine work? If so, what is the correct dose? My students and I searched the literature. We located an article by Hendeles, published in 1993. He was reporting on well-done but unpublished studies from before 1971 by Hylan Bickerman of Columbia University that showed phenylpropanolamine, a common oral decongestant at the time, worked, as did another compound called pseudoephedrine, but oral phenylephrine did not. Hendeles’ paper did not get much attention since phenylephrine wasn’t widely used in the 1990s. However, roughly 10 years later, it was suddenly important. Cold and flu medicine sits on a store shelf on September 12, 2023 in Miami, Florida. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel announced that an ingredient in many over-the-counter cold and allergy medications called phenylephrine doesn’t work to get rid of nasal congestion and that the decongestant was no more effective than a placebo. Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images I contacted Hendeles and he and I decided to get to the bottom of whether oral phenylephrine worked. Before the FDA required that drugs had to be proven effective, it determined whether OTC drugs were effective through expert panels that reviewed existing data. These OTC monographs establish what older OTC ingredients can be marketed without FDA approval. The oral decongestant monograph panel reviewed a few published studies and multiple unpublished studies for phenylephrine. Of the unpublished studies, only four studies showed oral phenylephrine was effective, while seven showed it was no better than placebo. We requested copies of all evidence used by the nasal decongestant review panel via a Freedom of Information Act request and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis ourselves. Our findings validated the concerns from the Bickerman study and the pharmacists’ calls to UF. Interestingly, we found that one commercial laboratory gave strikingly positive results for oral phenylephrine’s efficacy. The low variability of the data, a lack of increasing effect with an increased dose and the lack of a placebo response prompted us to look at the data more closely. A statistical analysis of this laboratory’s data suggested integrity issues; normal variation of measurements should have a typical distribution from zero to nine for the last digit, but here nearly a quarter of all observations ended with a five. Such anomalies occur when data are falsified. We were confident then that oral phenylephrine did not work. We then naively contacted the FDA to inform them of what we had found. They were not interested. Oral phenylephrine was not harming anyone, so they saw no need to limit sales. FDA uses a risk-based approach to regulatory actions because they have limited resources, so the relative safety of oral phenylephrine relegated it to the back burner despite its ineffectiveness. So, we took the political route, contacting then-congressman Henry Waxman, whose committee at the time had FDA oversight. Waxman’s office wrote four letters imploring the agency to reconsider oral phenylephrine’s effectiveness. We also submitted a citizen’s petition to the FDA in early 2007. Finally, in December 2007, more than a year after we first discovered oral phenylephrine didn’t work, the FDA somewhat begrudgingly formed a Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee meeting to review the compound’s effectiveness. Credit: Amanda Montañez; Source: Randy Hatton The FDA has multiple regulatory processes for different types of medicinal compounds. People are perhaps most familiar with the New Drug Application process, which leads to clinical trials for prescription drug approvals. However, many OTC or nonprescription drugs are regulated differently. In fact, a law passed in 1951, the Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, created the categories of prescription and nonprescription drugs. In 1962, the act was amended again so that drugs had to be shown to be effective, hence the requirement for well-done clinical trials. But what about the drugs that were approved before 1962? This is the loophole that some OTC drugs fall through. For prescription drugs, FDA tried to address pre-1962 approvals through a review of over 3,000 prescription drugs. Most of those drugs have now been reviewed and addressed, but there are still unapproved prescription drugs on the market today, such as an extended-release form of oral nitroglycerin. For nonprescription drugs, FDA established the OTC monograph process 10 years after the 1962 amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which required products not proven effective to be reconsidered. FDA formed advisory panels grouping hundreds of ingredients into 26 categories based on the products' uses. After gathering all available information, both published and unpublished, from manufacturers, the advisory panels issued final reports to FDA about whether these ingredients were GRASE (generally recognized as safe and effective), not GRASE, or inconclusive. GRASE ingredients can be used in nonprescription drugs without FDA approval if the use matches the monograph. The monograph for OTC nasal decongestants started in 1976 and listed three effective oral decongestants: phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine. The review took 18 years, and the final monograph was released in 1994. Phenylpropanolamine was removed from the market in the 2000s, because it was associated with strokes. It was effective—just not safe. At the time, most OTC nasal decongestants contained either phenylpropanolamine or pseudoephedrine—few contained oral phenylephrine, perhaps because manufacturers privately questioned its effectiveness. FDA's charge for the 2007 Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee was to determine whether phenylephrine in a 10-mg immediate release formulation may be effective when dosed every [four] hours for symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Although most of the committee voted that there was some evidence that oral phenylephrine may be effective, they recognized the limitations of the available evidence. They asked for new data on the absorption and efficacy of oral phenylephrine using more modern standards. Schering-Plough, the maker of Claritin D (loratadine and pseudoephedrine), was already studying phenylephrine as an alternative oral decongestant. In addition to funding two studies that found phenylephrine was no better than placebo when patients with seasonal allergies were exposed to allergens (grass and ragweed) in a controlled chamber, they funded additional research. The oral absorption of phenylephrine is erratic. Perhaps that is why it was not used as an oral decongestant until it was the only choice. It had long been known that enzymes in the gut lining metabolized oral phenylephrine to inactive metabolites, reducing the amount of the active compound that could enter the bloodstream. The most cited study found that an oral dose of phenylephrine had an absorption rate of 38 percent of an oral dose of phenylephrine, but this study measured more than just the compound's active form. Later studies with more sensitive tests found that less than 1 percent of oral phenylephrine enters the bloodstream in an active form. Phenylephrine causes blood vessels to constrict, so if there isn’t enough of the active compound in the bloodstream, it won’t reduce the swelling of nasal blood vessels to aid in reducing nasal congestion. After the 2007 FDA advisory committee suggested better data on phenylephrine’s efficacy were needed, Schering-Plough funded Eli Meltzer to do two studies showing oral phenylephrine was no better than placebo—even when using up to four times the approved dosage. Based on Meltzer's research, we filed a second citizen's petition in 2015. The science was clear: oral phenylephrine does not work. Then, we waited. Nothing seemed to happen at FDA. We wrote an academic commentary in 2022 asking, “Why is Oral Phenylephrine on the Market After Compelling Evidence of Its Ineffectiveness as a Decongestant?” We did not know that with a new administration and new FDA Commissioner, the agency had already started a thorough review of all the available data. In 2023, 16 external experts on the second Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee looked at all the evidence compiled by FDA staff, heard manufacturers’ arguments that oral phenylephrine was effective, and heard from experts like me who argued that oral phenylephrine was ineffective. In the end, they concluded that oral phenylephrine is not GRASE. A final ruling on whether these decongestants can be sold will take time. Hopefully, science will prevail. We’ve learned from this experience that the monograph process for OTC drugs approved before 1962 needs to be reexamined. Other nonprescription drugs like guaifenesin (sold in Mucinex and Robitussin), dextromethorphan (sold in Robitussin DM), and antihistamines for a cold like chlorpheniramine likely don't help with coughs and colds. They are usually not dangerous, but their effects are likely to be a placebo response; more modern research is needed. The oral phenylephrine example shows that FDA needs more funding to look at these old drugs. We need public funds to support independent researchers who want to examine these products objectively. The government should be able to spend millions to save consumers billions on ineffective products. Companies that market these products have no incentive to prove they don't work. Nonprescription drugs must be effective—not just safe. Considering all the confusion around these drugs, remember pharmacists receive considerable education on OTC drugs—more than any other health care profession. Ask your pharmacist when you have questions about which OTC products to choose. And then ask your local congressional representatives to support modern scientific reviews of these old OTC products. Your pocketbook, if not your respiratory health, will see the rewards.

There&#x27;s basically three options for coughs with support behind them, the problem is most professionals neglect distinguishing when to use which and just prescribe willy-nilly:For suppression of &#x27;ticklish&#x27; coughing (i.e. where any form of very minor irritant in the air will set off a coughing fit): Dextromethorphan, which is an antitussive (and which is psychoactive and depending on genetics WILL make you trip even at therapeutic non-abuse doses)For &#x27;sticky&#x27; coughs where the mucus refuses to depart: Ambroxol, which functions as a Mucolytic, i.e. it makes the mucus&#x2F;phlegm thinner by causing partial breakdown of them, i.e. it fucks with phlegm composition which in turn fucks with the phlegm&#x27;s rheological parametersFor &#x27;dry&#x27; coughs, where there isn&#x27;t enough mucus: Guaifenesin, which functions as an expectorant (albeit as explained below, \"Secretolytic\" seems like the better term by far), ramping up mucus production&#x2F;bronchial secretions&#x2F;hydration. (avoid confabulating with Guanfacine.)And then of course for ticklish coughs&#x2F;antitussive action, there&#x27;s two other, much better solutions, but ones with it&#x27;s own issues: Codeine & Dihydrocodeine. Works wonders — as long as your CYP2D6 doesn&#x27;t function in an atypical manner, in which case it&#x27;ll either not work at all or get you way too high.Part of the problem is that a lot of the literature uses the word \"expectorant\" in the same way I used it above, but really, the more appropriate word to describe guaifenesin is \"Secretolytic\".Obligatory disclaimer:this comment isn&#x27;t medical advice, I&#x27;m neither a medical professional nor a medical paraprofessional, in case of concerns, contact&#x2F;consult an appropriate medical professional and&#x2F;or appropriate medical paraprofessional.I wish I knew why no combination of Guaifenesin & Ambroxol seems to exist on the market, but there probably exists SOME reason.To any professionals reading this:Sorry for the low quality content, I know it&#x27;s very flawed reply toast0 6 hours agorootparentprevDextromethorphan has some effect at least. Not sure that it helps much with coughing, but it does something. I&#x27;ve heard codine can help with coughing although again the primary effect seems to be sedation.IME, guafenesin can be helpful for making coughs more productive, hydration helps with that too, and again IME, so do spicy foods.

(It was even used, under a different brand, on Apollo missions -- there was a TV ad with an astronaut endorsing it.) A lot of people are grumpy that a well-known effective medicine was made hard to get, and something else sneakily substituted.The point being, it&#x27;s not entirely a surprise that people are aware of the phenylephrine -- especially if they&#x27;re older than, say, 40, and live in the United States.

I vaguely remember when Sudafed got put behind counters because it was used to make meth. I don&#x27;t frequently get sick. Often, the last medication I bought is expired by the time I need it again.

Usually this knocks it off and I will keep taking one of the once-a-day meds for a bit to prevent reoccurrence.Zyrtec and Flonase together is probably the best normal combo and is generally accepted to be ok.Disclaimers: I&#x27;m not a doctor. Combining a nose spray and a pill is generally accepted practice and studied in several peer review studies I&#x27;ve seen. Stacking claritin and zyrtec pills together is not generally accepted practice, so don&#x27;t do it. reply TillE 11 hours agorootparentYes, cetirizine and fluticasone are a good long-term treatment for allergies.Direct decongestants like pseudoephedrine are of limited use because you quickly develop a tolerance and they become ineffective.

The Eight Cups was developed for military basic training, not every day life. The other thing that can help allergies is washing your nose out with Ocean Nasal Spray (actual product name).

You could just as well buy the ingredients individually and take them together. People buy the combination product to be saved the trouble, which isn&#x27;t compatible with the trouble of getting something from behind the counter.So there generally isn&#x27;t a combination product available with the decongestant that actually works in them.

Adding lots of one type of patient yo one side of a study, without adding similar to the control group, invalidates the whole study.And people who are already \"hopeless\" may end up masking the good outcomes for people earlier in treatment.Currently there&#x27;s no mechanism for random unproven drugs to be disseminated outside of a study, but equally its a rare study that wants to add \"certain death\" candidates to the roster.If we want \"hail mary\" options in drug administration then we need that to exist outside of nedical studies.

The rapid innovation of the private sector, driven by consumers who want their suffering alleviated in the fastest and most effective way, is the suffering alleviator. And the slow, obstructive, and competition-free corrupted public sector, the FDA, is the one causing drug innovation costs to be sky high, thereby causing excess deaths and suffering that the private sector would otherwise have been preventing.You&#x27;re siding with the baddy and blaming the goodies for his wrongdoing. reply dboat 6 hours agorootparentNo, I&#x27;m not pretending that the FDA is nothing but good, that is a straw man.

But someone realized phenylephrine was approved OTC and sounded sort of like pseudoephedrine, so they could claim the shelf space and edge pseudoephedrine products.Their defense to the FDA in being allowed to continue to market despite being proven even before they began their cynical ploy was consumers want convenience, which sadly is clearly true, that despite knowing if you walked five feet further and got the pseudoephedrine they would get relief they grabbed the drug conveniently placed.

I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a straight answer from TSA, and very rarely a straight answer from a police officer. When I’ve been travelling with things that have specific actual laws that apply to them, I’ve taken to printing out the actual applicable laws (and their policies). It’s rare they actually follow them at first (and multiple times I’ve had them instruct me to do something that would violate them, or had they themselves violate them), but showing them politely usually helps.I even had TSA once (many years ago), bring me my checked luggage with a gun in it (legally) to the gate in the terminal, and ask me to unlock it right there and demonstrate it was unloaded. A case with ammunition in it too (also legally). To do that demonstration, I’d have to pick it up and manipulate it.I politely declined, not wanting to get shot or arrested, and showed them their policy instead which is that needed to be done before security, outside of the ‘sterile area’ - and I in fact had done so. They insisted a couple more times, I insisted I wasn’t going to violate the law or their policies, they got a supervisor which got angry at them, and they eventually left. And it was transported to my destination, unmolested, as was I.Still a hassle, and quite concerning - they either legitimately thought it might be loaded and transported it anyway, or were so confused they did that song and dance for awhile until they could figure it out - and thought the answer was to have the passenger handle a potentially loaded gun in the secure area of the airport to demonstrate everything was actually fine?

If I forgot, take off and landing would be miserable because my ears wouldn’t pop. reply hunter2_ 17 hours agorootparentYou probably know given your username, but Sudafed is also great for diving to avoid barotrauma (MEBT). Just need to ensure it&#x27;s not less than the 12 hour formulation, lest it wear off at depth. reply mattmaroon 17 hours agorootparentA year ago I had an eardrum suddenly and randomly rupture (probably due to an infection I never felt before it happened) and after it healed a bit, my ENT told me that I should take it before a flight just to be sure to open the eustachian tubes.Oddly a few days later I overheard pilots in the airport lounge talking about times their eardrum ruptured due to a cold or something. It’s an injury that’s not uncommon for them.Now I pop one before a fight every time just to be safe. If you’ve never had an eardrum rupture let’s just say it isn’t fun. reply Nursie 4 hours agorootparentMy eardrum rupture was amazing. Would recommend :)Not so much “fun” as “blessed relief”. I picked up some sort of nasty flu in Mexico in about 2005, and my eustachian tubes got blocked for a few weeks, resulting in an ear infection with pressure building up behind the eardrum in one of my ears.When that drum finally burst I felt so much better. It was a sharp pain, and it was a bit gross, but so much better…Pseudoephedrine did nothing for me (it usually works great) and it took a a course of co-amoxiclav to finally clear up the infection. reply prmph 19 hours agoparentprevThey hitched a profitable ride on the placebo effect bandwagon reply toast0 18 hours agoparentprevI seem to recall reading something that said there is an effective does of phenylephrine, if you take it by itself, 2x the dose works, but if you take it with other meds, it might be ok by itself. Something about the stomach acid neutralizing it. Might help to take it with food too. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentWhat you’re probably thinking of is topical (is that the right word here?) phenylephrine. If you snort it, like as a nasal spray, and it soaks directly into the inflamed nasal tissue, then it has an effect. Swallowing it does not.Analogy: you wouldn’t eat hemorrhoid cream. reply rybosworld 19 hours agoprevI was surprised when I heard they are taking phenylephrine off the market.In my anecdotal experience, it was extremely effective at drying out my sinuses, which did reduce congestion. So I asked some family and friends and their responses were mixed. Some said it did nothing and others swore it was effective.I&#x27;m not claiming that phenylephrine is in fact generally effective, just wondering out loud if there could be more to the story. I.e., it works for some people and not others.Anecdotes are not science. But if enough people share an experience, sometimes there is more to the story. reply exoverito 19 hours agoparentAnecdotes are the material for new hypotheses, so they are very much part of the scientific process.This reminds me of the debate around monosodium glutamate (MSG) causing headaches. There were early scientific reports which found no real link and that it was probably psychosomatic nonsense. However more recent studies found that some people have a heightened sensitivity to glutamate, and since it is a literal neurotransmitter there is a promising pathway for the mechanism of action.Biology is stupendously complex, it&#x27;s difficult to make hard and fast rules about something being categorically effective or ineffective. reply evanjrowley 18 hours agorootparentThanks for this comment. I maintain the unpopular position that both 1) phenylephrine is mildly effective for drying out my sinuses, and 2) MSG definitely gives me headaches, unlike salt, so most likely glutamate is the culprit. reply Der_Einzige 12 hours agorootparentprevSilly fun fact, the chemical code for MSG (e621) just happens to also be the name of the largest furry \"booru\" site on the internet. I have no idea why this is. reply sarchertech 19 hours agoparentprevWhat form are you talking about? The nasal spray isn’t being removed because it is effective. It’s the oral version that isn’t effective.Also the placebo effect is real. So even if the boxes had always been packed with sugar pills, you would expect some people to report that it was effective for them.Additionally, even if it did have some mild effect, oral pseudoephedrine is better in nearly every way. reply Qem 18 hours agoparentprev> The oral absorption of phenylephrine is erratic. Perhaps that is why it was not used as an oral decongestant until it was the only choice. It had long been known that enzymes in the gut lining metabolized oral phenylephrine to inactive metabolites, reducing the amount of the active compound that could enter the bloodstream. The most cited study found that an oral dose of phenylephrine had an absorption rate of 38 percent of an oral dose of phenylephrine, but this study measured more than just the compound&#x27;s active form. Later studies with more sensitive tests found that less than 1 percent of oral phenylephrine enters the bloodstream in an active form.Perhaps you have a less active form of the enzyme that degrades it. reply bmurphy1976 19 hours agoparentprevMy anecdote is that for me I&#x27;ve known phenylephrine worthless for decades and seek out pseudoephedrine when I need actual relief. Now we have two data points. reply JHonaker 19 hours agoparentprev> Anecdotes are not science. But if enough people share an experience, sometimes there is more to the story.Solely relying on anecdotes as evidence is not science, but they’re absolutely a critical part of it! reply corethree 19 hours agorootparentScience is expensive and moves slow. Sometimes anecdotes are all you have.Just because the science doesn&#x27;t exist doesn&#x27;t mean anecdotes are completely invalid. reply JHonaker 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what I was trying to say. Anecdotes are the seeds of hypotheses, and enough anecdotes with well-understood conditions make a study population.> Science is expensive and moves slow.I don&#x27;t know if I agree that science is slow. Certainly scientific consensus is slow though. The churn of ideas at the forefronts of fields is rapid. In my field (machine learning&#x2F;statistics) I&#x27;d say too rapid&#x2F;short term incentive focused.I really take umbrage at the idea that science is some purely objective, ideal process. It&#x27;s messy, and scientists are opinionated and stubborn. Some of the most obstinate people I&#x27;ve met are tenured professors... They kind of have to be. It takes time for good ideas to weather the initial criticisms, persist through replication and testing, and to take hold. reply corethree 15 hours agorootparentScience is slow for sure. You need to gather samples and run tests. Often testing for causality is impossible, because you literally need to \"cause\" the issue in your sample group and that raises ethical issues if the thing you&#x27;re \"causing\" is harmful.It&#x27;s not even the human parts that are flawed with science either.Science is fundamentally flawed by nature because in science and therefore reality as you know it you cannot prove anything to be true. You can only falsify things in science. Proof is the domain of mathematics. reply evanjrowley 18 hours agoparentprevI had the same experience with phenylephrine. It dried out my sinuses, which helped me slightly with decongestion but moreso with post-nasal drip.The effect was not dramatic, and as I understand it, people with allergies need that dramatic effect to be able to breath well.It seems to me phenylephrine was effective for something different than what the FDA had in mind, but due to their folly, now both phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine are unavailable to the average person. reply diebeforei485 7 hours agoparentprevAre you referring to tablets or nasal spray? reply standardUser 11 hours agoparentprevI think the fact that different drugs work differently on different people is criminally underrated. reply fixedpointsnake 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been looking for this comment in all these stories regarding the ineffectiveness of phenylephrine!I have a similar story. Congestion is not a symptom I typically get. Covid, however, decided to shake things up and introduce me to a new set of symptoms... One of those was congestion such that my head felt like a balloon. Without experience treating this symptom, I went out and ended up with Sudafed PE, oral phenylephrine. It worked _immediately_, it was like a balloon deflating. It worked so well that these headlines regarding phenylephrine&#x27;s ineffectiveness still cause bemusement...anddd that&#x27;s my story. reply fredgrott 19 hours agoparentprevAnecdotes are not science. But if enough people share an experience, sometimes there is more to the story.Read that again in context to the two people who found the science of why it does not work..You are defeating your argument... reply evanjrowley 18 hours agorootparentThere is a problem with the studies these pharmacists are referencing. They are measuring nasal resistance, however, the measurement is not sufficient to capture the combination of things that make up nasal resistance. It&#x27;s a combination of how much mucus is being secreted vs the degree of sinus inflammation.New theory: Allergy sufferers are likely primarily experiencing sinus inflammation. Pseudoephedrine is the better solution for that. For those of us who are dealing with secretion - phenylephrine is effective.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jacionline.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0091-6749(06)00633-6&#x2F;ful... reply travisjungroth 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s a case study but a fancy anecdote?

    "originBody": "Health Care ProPublica Adds Ownership Information to Our Nursing Home Database It can be hard to determine who is ultimately responsible for the quality of care in a nursing home. ProPublica’s Nursing Home Inspect tool now has detailed information on who owns a facility and who is responsible for running it. by Ruth Talbot Dec. 20, 7 a.m. EST Twitter Facebook Copy Link Copied! Change Appearance Auto Light Dark Republish This Story ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. The quality of care that residents receive in a nursing home can be profoundly affected by who owns it, studies have shown. It’s not always clear who should be held accountable, though: Many nursing homes are owned by companies that are owned by other companies, obscuring who has the ultimate decision-making power. As more nursing homes are sold, information about an incoming owner’s performance in other homes becomes more relevant, as it may provide insight into how their latest acquisitions will fare.

Support journalism that speaks truth to power. Donate To help navigate the confusing world of nursing home ownership, ProPublica’s Nursing Home Inspect now publishes detailed ownership information for facilities and an upgraded search to help you sift through the information. The data comes from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which publishes “affiliated entities” for nursing homes — lists of people or companies that have an ownership stake in or operational control over multiple nursing homes. CMS’ goal is to provide a better understanding of an owner or operator’s performance across all the nursing homes they are associated with. Some entities are affiliated with only a handful of homes, while others, like Genesis HealthCare or The Ensign Group, are affiliated with hundreds of homes across multiple states. Because CMS does not provide this data in a way that’s easy for most people to use, we’ve added it to our Nursing Home Inspect tool. Our new affiliated entity pages allow users to easily explore data on each company or person who is responsible for nursing homes, listing all homes associated with that entity and showing recent serious deficiencies — failure to meet care requirements — found at those homes. You can even view a list of all affiliated entities nationwide. We also added detailed ownership information to individual nursing home pages, allowing users to see who has an ownership stake in the home, as well as who has managerial control over the facility and how long they have held that position. To go along with these additions, we’ve also expanded the database’s advanced search capabilities so journalists and others can quickly identify affiliated entities that have a history of serious deficiencies or other problems. For instance, users can search for all serious deficiencies associated with Life Care Centers of America. Explore Our Expanded Database Nursing Home Inspect Separately, users can also now filter searches by F-tags, which are a system for specifying the types of compliance issues that may be found during a CMS inspection. These tags allow users to narrow their search beyond broad categories such as “infection control deficiencies” to more targeted queries such as deficiencies associated with reporting COVID-19 data to residents and families or ensuring staff are vaccinated against COVID-19. ProPublica plans to continue enhancing Nursing Home Inspect with new data and features in the coming months.

The nursing home industry is dirty and sad, with for-profit groups squeezing every cent they can out of seniors who can&#x27;t advocate for themselves, out of their families, and ultimately out of the taxpayer. They do that by poorly staffing their homes, and by creating networks of other legal entities that charge the home money so it doesn&#x27;t make a profit.For example, a holding company might own the nursing home operator as well as the building owner who charges them exorbitant rent, or the service providers selling into the home. If I had one piece of advice for someone with aging parents: find a non-profit home if you need a home at all. The sisters of mercy, the Jewish community homes. For-profit nursing homes are to our era what insane asylums were to the 19th century. A horrifying disgrace. reply candiddevmike 11 hours agoparentThis is where the government could step in and provide nursing homes.

The VA&#x27;s funding, as well as programs administered by the VA, is subject to tit for tat battles in the House Appropriations Committee.

Unlike private hospitals the VA is obligated to serve all veterans and it&#x27;s the portion that they miss or manage out that became problematic national news. There&#x27;s a reason Obama passed legislation allowing veterans to seek outside care and it wasn&#x27;t always wait times. It also had to do with VA guidelines, standards, and practices which very much differ from private care. reply kjs3 9 hours agorootparentprevwhy not have more control over quality and standardsIn theory they do, since eligibility for getting paid by Medicare has requirements.

TFA pertains to nursing homes (a.k.a. \"skilled nursing facilities\"), not personal care homes or assisted living. Sisters of Mercy seems to fall under one of the latter categories, so the poster to which I responded may have conflated the two. Obviously, Sisters of Mercy has nurses (who are skilled) working for them. I was only curious whether they provide care that can&#x27;t be obtained at an assisted living facility, such as IV meds and ventilators. But they aren&#x27;t listed by the ProPublica tool, so that probably answers my question. reply reaperman 7 hours agorootparentprev“Skilled nursing” is an industry term for the services provided to elderly people who are not able to live semi-independently, and need daily nursing care for health issues or significant degree of mental decline. reply Spooky23 6 hours agorootparentprevYes.Do you find skilled nursing in this facilities?

    "originBody": "prescription for privacy — CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens hand out medical records to cops without warrants Lawmakers want HHS to revise health privacy law to require warrants. Beth Mole - 12/12/2023, 8:31 PM Enlarge GettyJeffrey Greenberg reader comments 93 All of the big pharmacy chains in the US hand over sensitive medical records to law enforcement without a warrant—and some will do so without even running the requests by a legal professional, according to a congressional investigation. The revelation raises grave medical privacy concerns, particularly in a post-Dobbs era in which many states are working to criminalize reproductive health care. Even if people in states with restrictive laws cross state lines for care, pharmacists in massive chains, such as CVS, can access records across borders. Lawmakers noted the pharmacies' policies for releasing medical records in a letter dated Tuesday to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra. The letter—signed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.)—said their investigation pulled information from briefings with eight big prescription drug suppliers. They include the seven largest pharmacy chains in the country: CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart Stores, Inc., The Kroger Company, and Rite Aid Corporation. The lawmakers also spoke with Amazon Pharmacy. All eight of the pharmacies said they do not require law enforcement to have a warrant prior to sharing private and sensitive medical records, which can include the prescription drugs a person used or uses and their medical conditions. Instead, all the pharmacies hand over such information with nothing more than a subpoena, which can be issued by government agencies and does not require review or approval by a judge. Three pharmacies—CVS Health, The Kroger Company, and Rite Aid Corporation—told lawmakers they didn't even require their pharmacy staff to consult legal professionals before responding to law enforcement requests at pharmacy counters. According to the lawmakers, CVS, Kroger, and Rite Aid said that \"their pharmacy staff face extreme pressure to immediately respond to law enforcement demands and, as such, the companies instruct their staff to process those requests in store.\" Advertisement The rest of the pharmacies—Amazon, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart, and Walgreens Boots Alliance—at least require that law enforcement requests be reviewed by legal professionals before pharmacists respond. But, only Amazon said it had a policy of notifying customers of law enforcement demands for pharmacy records unless there were legal prohibitions to doing so, such as a gag order. HIPAA and transparency The lawmakers note that the pharmacies aren't violating regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The pharmacies pointed to language in HIPAA regulations that allow health care providers, including pharmacists, to provide medical records if required by law, with subpoenas being a sufficient legal process for such a request. However, the lawmakers note that the HHS has discretion in determining the legal standard here—that is, it has the power to strengthen the regulation to require a warrant, which the lawmakers say it should do. \"We urge HHS to consider further strengthening its HIPAA regulations to more closely align them with Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy and Constitutional principles,\" the three lawmakers wrote. They also pushed for pharmacies to do better, encouraging them to follow the lead of tech companies. \"Pharmacies can and should insist on a warrant, and invite law enforcement agencies that insist on demanding patient medical records with solely a subpoena to go to court to enforce that demand. The requirement for a warrant is exactly the approach taken by tech companies to protect customer privacy.\" The trio noted that Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have since 2010 required law enforcement to have a warrant to obtain customers' emails. Also noting tech companies' lead, the lawmakers encouraged pharmacies to publish annual transparency reports. In the course of the investigation, only CVS Health said it planned to do so. \"Americans deserve to have their private medical information protected at the pharmacy counter and a full picture of pharmacies’ privacy practices, so they can make informed choices about where to get their prescriptions filled,\" the lawmakers wrote. For now, HIPAA regulations grant patients the right to know who is accessing their health records. But, to do so, patients have to specifically request that information—and almost no one does that. \"Last year, CVS Health, the largest pharmacy in the nation by total prescription revenue, only received a single-digit number of such consumer requests,\" the lawmakers noted. \"The average American is likely unaware that this is even a problem,\" the lawmakers said. reader comments 93 Beth Mole Beth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

They have someone on the edge of death and the cops often are in the room yelling at the nurses to get them to do a blood draw and drug screening.Cops need a warrant to get that, and even if they had a warrant in hand, performing the blood draw wouldn&#x27;t even be considered until the patient is stabilized. But they never have a warrant, and the pressure the cops apply is withering. Most people -- even doctors and nurses -- would eventually cave.Fortunately, as the charge nurse, she&#x27;s the one who has to approve such a thing, so the cops have to deal with her. And she&#x27;s hard as a rock. They aren&#x27;t going to make her wilt. reply swells34 16 hours agorootparentWell, we&#x27;ve spoiled our police force.

Same reason they execute PIT maneuvers on busy roads, lead high speed chases through the middle of towns, and empty full magazines into densely populated areas, all things that police in other countries are trained not to do, trained to be patient and follow instead.

So it would take a specific law to make that carry through to pharmacies.And for that matter, I doubt the video store law applies to bookstores.(A judge confirmation process ran in trouble because of video rental records - so a law was written ... which addresses only video rental.

In most large cities, this is a guaranteed six figure income, with basically no education requirements. They are literally given an \"above the law\" status via qualified immunity.

They can also arrest you for something like \"obstruction\" or \"contempt of cop\" and that&#x27;s something you&#x27;d have to spend time and money on fighting later in the courts.

Seems to be some weird US thing. reply phatskat 16 hours agorootparentThat weird US thing is a fractured healthcare system. You might have your GP, a specialist, and a psychologist, who all work in different offices that use different records system which may or may not have a working level of interoperability.Chances are, if any of them know about the medications you’re on that they didn’t prescribe, it’s because you self-disclosed on your intake form or told the nurse during intake verbally. This is not necessarily a great way to know for sure, because patients forget things and people write or type or select the wrong thing.In this system, it’s much more reliable to have all the prescriptions flow down to one endpoint and have someone trained who can see the exact medications and dosages, and that person can then give the patient the relevant information they need at the time of service. reply hughesjj 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;5j_wjlfJ65U?si=mwjaRYqi8l6Bo0DJ reply swells34 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s redundancy.

C2 scripts are an absolute joy to fill here (&#x2F;s) because you&#x27;re constantly dealing with some tinpot dictator at the pharmacy window who is upset you&#x27;re filling it on the earliest day you&#x27;re allowed as opposed to waiting for the last day and finding out it&#x27;s out-of-stock (because of the constant shortages).the argument is that pharmacists are a \"last line of defense\" against the fractured system or mistakes from doctors (or clerical errors etc) but their authority is absolutely not limited to correcting errors or double-checking with the doctor&#x27;s office. In practice the pharmacists here are incredibly full of themselves, they&#x27;ll refuse to dispense birth control, etc, and there is no duty for the pharmacy to ensure someone else will service you, they can just say \"no\" and that&#x27;s it. reply annoyingnoob 19 hours agoparentprevIn the time before ubiquitous cell phones, I was a cashier at a gas station.

And it is unclear to me if those pharmacies are at least asking to see it, or if they are telling their staff to handle any and all requests, no questions asked. reply ClarityJones 19 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s a distinction without a difference. In this context, where this is no pending legal proceeding, a subpoena is just a request with no legal authority. The function of a real subpoena is to punish the recipient for failing to respond (i.e. held in contempt of court), because the request is made on behalf of the court and the court has the authority to compel production. Here, where there&#x27;s no court case it&#x27;s not really possible to have a real subpoena. I could equally issue a subpoena in the authority of my own name, and it would have just as much power (none). reply aredox 19 hours agoparentprevLibrarians do it. reply BeetleB 18 hours agorootparentLibrarians are not overworked the way pharmacists are.To give you an idea, in a nearby Walgreens, we have pharmacists snapping at customers saying \"We got your prescription only two days ago.

Even if people in states with restrictive laws cross state lines for care, pharmacists in massive chains, such as CVS, can access records across borders.I was “pro-life” from as long as I can remember thinking about the issue (I still recall the Bush v. Gore debates) until I voted last month in favor of making free access to abortion a constitutional right in Ohio. It initially took some coaxing from my wife, who helped me try to understand the issue from a woman’s perspective, and for a while I had doubts about whether I had done the right thing, but reading about far-right shenanigans (or potential shenanigans) makes me 100% confident I’m now on the correct side on abortion.Wherever power __can__ be abused, it __will__ be abused. I wish abortion was less common, and we should work on making it less common, but the last thing we need is ideologues and extremist politicians second-guessing healthcare professionals and harassing women in what is one of the most desperate times in their lives.————————————————————————Edit: reading some of the strident and confrontational comments from some of those with whom I actually agree on the issue, it’s clear that “the cause”, if you will, doesn’t always have effective advocates.I have a fairly thick skin, some I’m avoiding engaging in a similarly mean-spirited way, but extremists (on both sides) are their own worst enemy. In the same way that I was pushed away from being “pro-life”, in part by far-right extremists, I imagine the extremists on the far-left are also losing friends and alienating people. reply dahart 16 hours agoparentNot sure why this is being downvoted, I agree that the privacy implications you called out are very serious, and I’m glad you’ve changed your mind and come to the conclusions you did.

I’m hearing there are a lot of people who were pro-life but didn’t ever expect Row-v-Wade to actually overturn, and now that they are seeing the real-world implications of that, are realizing it’s not a good idea to have dogmatic blanket bans. I heard a podcast about how Idaho’s in crisis because they’ve lost a bunch of their already very small number of obstetricians, because they’re now suspect and legally liable anytime a baby dies, and now women who are having serious pregnancy complications are unable to get care, and are being forced to travel long distances right at the moment they need help. reply ralmidani 16 hours agorootparentThank you!Retroactive shaming of anyone who was ever against your political position seems like some folks are devolving toward something even worse than cancel culture. The rudeness, as you put it, is not going to change my mind about the issue itself, but it does make me want to avoid the impossible-to-reason-with zealots. reply dahart 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, we need to be doing the exact opposite and welcoming and praising people who join us. I’ll say it now: welcome! I’m glad you’re here. We will not make headway with this issue by yelling louder at each other or being more obstinate. What you did is actually hard to do, challenging your own beliefs and changing your mind. That’s commendable.To be honest, I think if we could strip all existing talking points on both sides, and get people to truly derive their own personal conclusions from scratch, I would expect the vast majority of people to be both in favor of women having absolute autonomy over their health care and body choices, and also in favor of trying to avoid abortion as a contraceptive if we can, avoiding late abortions, and hopefully using it only or mostly as a tool to treat bad situations. In other words, I would expect a lot of people to have the exact stance you’re arriving at - that we need to allow people to do what they need to, and we still hope that abortion isn’t happening excessively or willy-nilly or late without medical necessity. The core idea behind the two camps, the ‘pro-‘ position of each side, is not necessarily in opposition at all, so it’s funny it’s gotten so extreme and presented as completely opposites. reply ralmidani 15 hours agorootparentI love it!And I’ll do you one better:US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, for all his faults (which are numerous), supported the 5-4 majority in a landmark case regarding flag burning.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Texas_v._JohnsonImagine if Justice William Brennan, who wrote the majority opinion, said to Scalia rudely and dismissively “you don’t really believe in civil liberties, you’re only an absolutist on free speech”.

The overarching point is to stop acting as if people are definitely right or wrong. stop arguing over semantics of words. reply dahart 16 hours agorootparentRight, each side is correct within its own framing of the issue, they are both right according to their own separate standards. Both sides are villainizing the other side, and you’re right: they don’t have to. It’s not necessary to say the other side is wrong or immoral. The problem is that in many ways it is pretty effective rally & argument strategy, at least locally & temporarily; it does help some people who mildly agree with it to cement their position and have dramatic talking points that spread.How do we break the cycle of increasing polarization? I honestly don’t know. It seems to be happening not just for abortion but for everything. All policy and culture, even innocuous stuff, seems to be getting polarized and tribalized in service of the politicians. Rejecting the extremist and villainizing framings of the opponent, on both sides, might help. Listening to and accepting the other side’s reasoning often does wonders for having civil conversation. I like to think of political debates as simply prioritizing what we want, and I wish our political debates would stop name-calling and just evaluate and rank the priorities rationally. This is hard to do though, it takes a lot of work, and there are conflicting priorities. Yelling and polarizing is way easier, takes less work, and is helping some politicians get what they want without having to be polite to their opponents or spend time evaluating their arguments. Maybe it would do some good if we can just help everybody we know see that our debates are mostly making us all tools of the politicians? reply larkost 15 hours agorootparentprevI have always thought that the phrase that was popular some years ago \"science tells us that life begins at conception\" was odd, and misunderstands what we know about life from science.Life does not begin at conception because it never stopped. The sperm and the egg were both alive at the time of conception, and were life that split off of the collections of cells that we call the parents. Those parents were in turn conceived of live cells (again: a live sperm and a live egg) that came from their parents.The whole point is that life is one big unbroken chain going back to some first cell (and at that point what is \"life\" gets complicated).Rather the whole thing is about a \"human life\", as in when do we decide that this ball of cells is a separate individual deserving of the protection we give \"people\". And that is almost completely arbitrary, and science can offer no input on this at all.Why is a fertilized egg a person? Why are the skin cells that have scraped off on your keyboard not a person deserving protection? If you start chopping bits of a person off (I am not recommending this), is the severed limb not a person? If you could chop off the head and keep both that and the body alive, would those be two people? Or would only the head count as a person? reply joelfried 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ll try to respond to your edit.People are arguing about your words because the ones you pick to make your argument DO matter. You&#x27;ve chosen the dichotomy generally pushed by the Right, rather than a discussion of health care or women&#x27;s safety. Consider the difference in feel if you posted this as your two conditionals:If you believe that doctors should be given leeway to treat their patients as they best see fit even if sometimes you disagree with their rationale, you&#x27;re going to believe abortion should be available.If you believe that moral rules should be followed and your moral rules are paramount regardless of any doctor&#x27;s opinion on the ground, you&#x27;re going to believe abortion should not be available.This gives a very different feel and perspective to the conversation. The words you pick matter. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 16 hours agorootparentthe ideas matter, not the words.the art to disagreeing with someone without vilifying them is to recognize their beliefs come from their values.Even what you&#x27;re trying to argue about healthcare.someone who believes in the word of God is going to argue an individual is less important than God&#x27;s commandments, someone who does not will argue the individual is more important.And I don&#x27;t want to hear any whiffle about a dichotomy here, consider it a spectrum between 0 and 1 if it makes you feel better.------------The point is that framing this as correct&#x2F;incorrect is a very poor way to frame it, it leaves no room for understanding. reply dpkirchner 16 hours agorootparentIt isn&#x27;t really a spectrum -- it&#x27;s binary. The question ultimately is: should the government be able to force you at gunpoint&#x2F;threat of imprisonment to carry a fetus for 9 months? If you say no, you&#x27;re on the side that claims to be pro-choice.

My question allows for a lot more answers, a lot more debate, and compassion for one another.A binary response leads only to argumentation because we can&#x27;t find the edges that we agree on, only the boundary we fight over. reply dpkirchner 13 hours agorootparent> When should the government be able to force you at gunpoint&#x2F;threat of imprisonment to carry a fetus for 9 months?If you get to the point where you&#x27;re asking \"when\", you&#x27;re already saying the government should be able to force you to carry a fetus. I&#x27;m not sure how else to interpret it.If it helps I guess you can twist my formulation to be \"the government should be able to force you to carry a fetus under some circumstances that are evaluated by people on a case-by-case basis\". All that \"under\" and beyond stuff is redundant, however.As soon as we say that a case requires evaluation we apply force. We coerce the person by threatening them with imprisonment if they don&#x27;t stop seeking an abortion. Further, we open the door to imprisoning people in a system that is already slow and burdensome; we then give people in government power to wait 9 months for the question to become moot.> A binary response leads only to argumentation because we can&#x27;t find the edges that we agree on, only the boundary we fight over.The debate is not nor has it ever been over circumstances or conditions -- that is a distraction from the pro-life crowd.For example, some propose exceptions for cases of rape. But can rape be proven in less than 9 months, including appeals? Obviously not. If an allegation or mere statement that a rape occurred is enough then we might as well not issue the threat.Others propose exceptions if the pregnancy threatens the pregnant person, which just means that some cases will be decided by the government, ultimately.The boundary is well-defined and fixed.

Squaring these positions with the description Pro-Life can be a little odd.While it is a little unfair to over-simplify this way, many Trump supporters are Pro-Life, and those same people seemed to enjoy and support his recent comments: \"Very simply: If you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store\".You can make a position that the thieves he was talking about have given up their right to life in a way that a fetus can not, but I think there is also an argument that this view can not be squared with a Pro-Life designation.

A lack of privacy protection allows the United States government to obtain information from third parties without a legal warrant and without otherwise complying with the Fourth Amendment prohibition against search and seizure without probable cause and a judicial search warrant.\"Ref: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Third-party_doctrineedit:If you want to learn the legal reasoning for this, check out \"Habeas Data: Privacy vs. the Rise of Surveillance Tech\" by Cyrus Farivar.

US laws really do not.That&#x27;s pretty much my point. We already have a similar amendment (the fourth amendment) already officially ratified, so this is not unprecedented.The problem with the fourth amendment is that it was written in a time when the government would need to physically go somewhere and take something, so there is no general principle allotted for digital privacy.At the same time, there _are_ laws governing ownership of data which made sense when it was the credit reporting agencies trading information for legitimate business purposes, but now we are in a very different landscape of what information can be stored, traded, transmitted, sold at a scale never before seen. These laws would need to be revised and would need the heft of a constitutional amendment to drive that process. reply creer 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair - and anyway nowadays even the interpretation of the constitution has never been more open.A problem with laws is that there are so many to choose from and they are so narrow. See for example the video rental records law. An extremely narrow law that ignores the broader issue entirely (and which penalty is not even scaled for inflation). Same for credit reporting. Or for HIPAA.General principle is needed and we are not likely to get that from laws. And in the US that&#x27;s not what laws are for. Generally. So the 4th amendment could be touched up to correct the fact that it was written when \"online\", \"data\", computers did not exist - and metadata was thin enough to not matter too much, and \"privacy\" was or was not the point and was unclear of a concept. Fixing the 4th would establish the principle that yes, now digital matters and privacy matters and must be included in the 4th. Otherwise we remain in the situation where it&#x27;s easy to argue that it&#x27;s not part of the 4th. replycreer 12 hours agorootparentprevSo this is a good point. There is this issue for either outright volunteering information or being bullied into \"volunteering\". And this a trend that apparently was not much of an issue at the time (of the constitution or 4th).Same for \"constitution applies only to govt\" - where now so many corporations or other groups wield comparable power.

The purpose of the constitution was to prevent government overreach, because it is a document that sets government rules.The reason other things aren’t in it isn’t because they aren’t or weren’t issues. It’s because they were out of scope for the purpose of that document. reply FireBeyond 18 hours agorootparentprevWell, tying back to the original topic, if I as a healthcare provider am not allowed to \"volunteer information about you\" to LE if you&#x27;re in a car accident or incident or similar, then why is a pharmacy allowed to, when the medications you take have a 1:1 or 1:few correlation to your healthcare?Silly specific example in this case, as a healthcare provider, I can&#x27;t tell a cop you have high blood pressure, because HIPAA.

The powers of judicial officers vary and are usually limited to a certain jurisdiction.\"It seems to me that there&#x27;s an extrapolation here that is not covered by HIPAA. HIPAA only refers to subpoenas issued by or reviewed by judicial officers, not a blanket allowance. reply kube-system 5 hours agorootparentThere’s another exception for non-judicial requests too.The provision that pharmacies are using is, I believe, this one:> To respond to an administrative request, including an administrative subpoena or summons, a civil or an authorized investigative demand, or similar process authorized under law, provided that: the information sought is relevant and material to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry; the request is specific and limited in scope to the extent reasonably practicable in light of the purpose for which the information is sought, and de-identified information could not reasonably be used (45 CFR 164.512(f)(1)(ii)(C)). reply FireBeyond 4 hours agorootparentGood point. The challenge I see with that is:> the information sought is relevant and material to a legitimate law enforcement inquiryYour average PharmTech at CVS isn&#x27;t assessing the legitimacy of the inquiry or its relevancy, but is instead blindly acquiescing (or being told to do so).The other part that is a problem is the use of \"and\":> and de-identified informationThere&#x27;s no de-identified information in \"Show me all the prescriptions you filled for Mr XYZ.\"But what there is is enough plausible deniability for the corporations to say they were following their interpretation of the law. replytristor 19 hours agorootparentprevThe police don’t behave this way in most other wealthy countries. For reasons that aren’t relevant context, I have had encounters with the police multiple times in the US and in numerous countries abroad and the difference in behavior is stark and clear.The FBI presumably has the responsibility and authority to police sheriffs departments and police departments that aren’t behaving appropriately, and the FBI is part of the Executive Branch. It would be relatively straightforward for the President to task resources to focus on this specific problem and ask the DoJ to focus on prosecuting civil rights cases.Elsewhere someone suggest a privacy amendment to the Constitution, we already have that and it’s the 4th amendment. We don’t need more legal protections, we need to actually hold police officers and departments accountable. We need to enforce the laws we already have, most importantly the Constitution, against officers and end effectively limitless immunity.We also need to raise hiring standards. The minimum standard to be a police officer in most civilized countries is similar to our requirements for FBI agents. Most police officers on duty in the US are uneducated, ignorant, and stupid so it is not a surprise that belligerent behavior is the norm. Only in the US did we actually have police departments placing a cap on the IQ of incoming officers. Only in the US do we have no national requirement for someone to serve as an officer. Some cities require a certification or attendance to a police academy, but there’s no national standard. Only in the US is the average cop your high school bully given a gun and a badge.There’s a lot more that could be done here. Hell, it doesn’t even have to be blue-tinted government action, it could be red-tinted government inaction by getting prosecutors to defect from the gang and uphold the right of self defense, correctly aligned to the actual law, in matters involving the police. It is legal under the letter and color of law to use lethal force to defend yourself against unlawful conduct by the police, most especially if they are attempting to use unlawful force or make an unlawful arrest, however as a practical matter prosecutors are in the gang and will “back the blue” no matter what. We could easily make even the idiots we hire as cops think twice before busting down a door without a warrant, announcing their purpose, or just plain knocking first.What I am very clearly not saying is any such stupidity as “disband the police”. In a well functioning society, the police serve a valuable purpose. We are not currently a well functioning society, and part of why is because the police operate like thugs. reply giraffe_lady 18 hours agorootparentAmerican cops might be the worst but they are by no means the only ones that are systematically bad. Cops are detested by large swaths of the population everywhere. France?? Just this past summer? Literal entire books have been written about how routinely indian police use torture. etc etc. Even if ours are the worst (idk) the problem is hardly unique to us. reply tristor 15 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s unique to the US, but it’s unique to the US among wealthy well functioning democracies. Most of the other countries where police abuse is rampant are poorer deeply corrupt countries, India is a great example in fact.India is at least a democracy, but it’s very much still developing and has corruption at nearly every level and facet of society, including police abuses. It’s nearly the opposite of well functioning. reply giraffe_lady 14 hours agorootparentFrance? And in Canada the police are detested by indigenous people for their long and consistent history of horrific treatment for example but not limited to the \"starlight tours.\" These are the only non-american countries I have first hand knowledge of but it&#x27;s enough for me to realize the problem is not limited to the US and developing nations.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Saskatoon_freezing_deaths reply tristor 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure what your point is?

I&#x27;m not trying to boil the ocean or solve racism (assuming it&#x27;s even solvable) here, I&#x27;m simply saying we have existing mechanisms to hold police accountable and we&#x27;ve simply decided as a society to not do so, and we should instead to decide to hold them accountable and to raise our standards for being a police officer.I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t enumerate every bad thing the police have ever done in every single country on Earth. I don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re expecting from the reply you made to me? reply giraffe_lady 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m saying the bad things american cops do are also things all the non-american cops do. The bad things are part of police, not the US. We may let them go farther than is the norm in similarly wealthy countries but they don&#x27;t get up to qualitatively different stuff. replybonton89 19 hours agorootparentprevJust require police to carry liability insurance so their misconduct is paid for by the insurance. If all insurance carriers drop them they cannot do police work anymore. You can even give them a raise to cover the extra insurance.

The police are a manifestation of our society. When they do bad things they do so in our name - whether or not you want them to do it. We have created a law enforcement structure that empowers these abuses to happen. Transferring the cost to them for acting the way society wants them to act is not the answer. We bear that responsibility and should bear that cost. reply ilovetux 16 hours agorootparent> When they do bad things they do so in our name - whether or not you want them to do it...Transferring the cost to them for acting the way society wants them to act is not the answer.This _maybe_ works in some abstract way, but each police officer is autonomous and has the leeway to act any way they want.I have autonomy as well, so I could commit a crime.Let&#x27;s say that I grew up poor, and the only opportunity in my neighborhood to make any substantial amount of money was to sell drugs. If I choose to sell drugs and get caught I go to jail.Now at this point, we can say that we have created a societal structure that limits my opportunities (no economic development in certain areas) and empowered these drug sales (by making the drugs illegal thus increasing their value) to happen, but that does not somehow shift the blame from me to society.I would do my prison sentence and try to move on with my life.This apologetic stance for the abuses of the police is harmful.Police officers are people and should have at least as many responsibilities and liabilities in the view of the law as any ordinary citizen.In fact, as they are charged with upholding our laws, they should be held to a higher standard than an ordinary citizen. If a police officer commits a crime, then they have committed that crime _and_ they have abused the trust placed in them by the state, county, etc that they work for. reply gosub100 18 hours agorootparentprevyeah, a profit-based system.

Police funding, promotions, and recognition could be realigned to much better promote a policing system that focus on actually serving the public rather than catching and punishing as many people as possible. reply SauciestGNU 14 hours agorootparentprevSomething I&#x27;ve been thinking about recently is making it specifically a crime for police to break laws in the absence of exigent circumstances, and then have exigency investigations for everything from police assaults (so-called \"use of force incidents\") to unlawfully parked patrol vehicles.

    "originLink": "https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits.html",
    "originBody": "Rust Blog Rust Install Learn Tools Governance Community Announcing `async fn` and return-position `impl Trait` in traits Dec. 21, 2023 · Tyler Mandry on behalf of The Async Working Group The Rust Async Working Group is excited to announce major progress towards our goal of enabling the use of async fn in traits. Rust 1.75, which hits stable next week, will include support for both -> impl Trait notation and async fn in traits. This is a big milestone, and we know many users will be itching to try these out in their own code. However, we are still missing some important features that many users need. Read on for recommendations on when and how to use the stabilized features. What's stabilizing Ever since the stabilization of RFC #1522 in Rust 1.26, Rust has allowed users to write impl Trait as the return type of functions (often called \"RPIT\"). This means that the function returns \"some type that implements Trait\". This is commonly used to return closures, iterators, and other types that are complex or impossible to write explicitly. /// Given a list of players, return an iterator /// over their names. fn player_names( players: &[Player] ) -> impl Iterator { players .iter() .map(|p| &p.name) } Starting in Rust 1.75, you can use return-position impl Trait in trait (RPITIT) definitions and in trait impls. For example, you could use this to write a trait method that returns an iterator: trait Container { fn items(&self) -> impl Iterator; } impl Container for MyContainer { fn items(&self) -> impl Iterator { self.items.iter().cloned() } } So what does all of this have to do with async functions? Well, async functions are \"just sugar\" for functions that return -> impl Future. Since these are now permitted in traits, we also permit you to write traits that use async fn. trait HttpService { async fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> HtmlBody; // ^^^^^^^^ desugars to: // fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> impl Future; } Where the gaps lie -> impl Trait in public traits The use of -> impl Trait is still discouraged for general use in public traits and APIs for the reason that users can't put additional bounds on the return type. For example, there is no way to write this function in a way that is generic over the Container trait: fn print_in_reverse(container: impl Container) { for item in container.items().rev() { // ERROR: ^^^ // the trait `DoubleEndedIterator` // is not implemented for // `impl Iterator` eprintln!(\"{item}\"); } } Even though some implementations might return an iterator that implements DoubleEndedIterator, there is no way for generic code to take advantage of this without defining another trait. In the future we plan to add a solution for this. For now, -> impl Trait is best used in internal traits or when you're confident your users won't need additional bounds. Otherwise you should consider using an associated type.1 async fn in public traits Since async fn desugars to -> impl Future, the same limitations apply. In fact, if you use bare async fn in a public trait today, you'll see a warning. warning: use of `async fn` in public traits is discouraged as auto trait bounds cannot be specified --> src/lib.rs:7:57async fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> HtmlBody;^^^^^help: you can desugar to a normal `fn` that returns `impl Future` and add any desired bounds such as `Send`, but these cannot be relaxed without a breaking API change7 - async fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> HtmlBody; 7 + fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> impl std::future::Future + Send;Of particular interest to users of async are Send bounds on the returned future. Since users cannot add bounds later, the error message is saying that you as a trait author need to make a choice: Do you want your trait to work with multithreaded, work-stealing executors? Thankfully, we have a solution that allows using async fn in public traits today! We recommend using the trait_variant::make proc macro to let your users choose. This proc macro is part of the trait-variant crate, published by the rust-lang org. Add it to your project with cargo add trait-variant, then use it like so: #[trait_variant::make(HttpService: Send)] pub trait LocalHttpService { async fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> HtmlBody; } This creates two versions of your trait: LocalHttpService for single-threaded executors and HttpService for multithreaded work-stealing executors. Since we expect the latter to be used more commonly, it has the shorter name in this example. It has additional Send bounds: pub trait HttpService: Send { fn fetch( &self, url: Url, ) -> impl Future + Send; } This macro works for async because impl Future rarely requires additional bounds other than Send, so we can set our users up for success. See the FAQ below for an example of where this is needed. Dynamic dispatch Traits that use -> impl Trait and async fn are not object-safe, which means they lack support for dynamic dispatch. We plan to provide utilities that enable dynamic dispatch in an upcoming version of the trait-variant crate. How we hope to improve in the future In the future we would like to allow users to add their own bounds to impl Trait return types, which would make them more generally useful. It would also enable more advanced uses of async fn. The syntax might look something like this: trait HttpService = LocalHttpService + Send; Since these aliases won't require any support on the part of the trait author, it will technically make the Send variants of async traits unnecessary. However, those variants will still be a nice convenience for users, so we expect that most crates will continue to provide them. Of course, the goals of the Async Working Group don't stop with async fn in traits. We want to continue building features on top of it that enable more reliable and sophisticated use of async Rust, and we intend to publish a more extensive roadmap in the new year. Frequently asked questions Is it okay to use -> impl Trait in traits? For private traits you can use -> impl Trait freely. For public traits, it's best to avoid them for now unless you can anticipate all the bounds your users might want (in which case you can use #[trait_variant::make], as we do for async). We expect to lift this restriction in the future. Should I still use the #[async_trait] macro? There are a couple of reasons you might need to continue using async-trait: You want to support Rust versions older than 1.75. You want dynamic dispatch. As stated above, we hope to enable dynamic dispatch in a future version of the trait-variant crate. Is it okay to use async fn in traits? What are the limitations? Assuming you don't need to use #[async_trait] for one of the reasons stated above, it's totally fine to use regular async fn in traits. Just remember to use #[trait_variant::make] if you want to support multithreaded runtimes. The biggest limitation is that a type must always decide if it implements the Send or non-Send version of a trait. It cannot implement the Send version conditionally on one of its generics. This can come up in the middleware pattern, for example, RequestLimitingService that is HttpService if T: HttpService. Why do I need #[trait_variant::make] and Send bounds? In simple cases you may find that your trait appears to work fine with a multithreaded executor. There are some patterns that just won't work, however. Consider the following: fn spawn_task(service: impl HttpService + 'static) { tokio::spawn(async move { let url = Url::from(\"https://rust-lang.org\"); let _body = service.fetch(url).await; }); } Without Send bounds on our trait, this would fail to compile with the error: \"future cannot be sent between threads safely\". By creating a variant of your trait with Send bounds, you avoid sending your users into this trap. Note that you won't see a warning if your trait is not public, because if you run into this problem you can always add the Send bounds yourself later. For a more thorough explanation of the problem, see this blog post.2 Can I mix async fn and impl trait? Yes, you can freely move between the async fn and -> impl Future spelling in your traits and impls. This is true even when one form has a Send bound.3 This makes the traits created by trait_variant nicer to use. trait HttpService: Send { fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> impl Future + Send; } impl HttpService for MyService { async fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> HtmlBody { // This works, as long as `do_fetch(): Send`! self.client.do_fetch(url).await.into_body() } } Why don't these signatures use impl Future + '_? For -> impl Trait in traits we adopted the 2024 Capture Rules early. This means that the + '_ you often see today is unnecessary in traits, because the return type is already assumed to capture input lifetimes. In the 2024 edition this rule will apply to all function signatures. See the linked RFC for more. Why am I getting a \"refine\" warning when I implement a trait with -> impl Trait? If your impl signature includes more detailed information than the trait itself, you'll get a warning: pub trait Foo { fn foo(self) -> impl Debug; } impl Foo for u32 { fn foo(self) -> String { // ^^^^^^ // warning: impl trait in impl method signature does not match trait method signature self.to_string() } } The reason is that you may be leaking more details of your implementation than you meant to. For instance, should the following code compile? fn main() { // Did the implementer mean to allow // use of `Display`, or only `Debug` as // the trait says? println!(\"{}\", 32.foo()); } Thanks to refined trait implementations it does compile, but the compiler asks you to confirm your intent to refine the trait interface with #[allow(refining_impl_trait)] on the impl. Conclusion The Async Working Group is excited to end 2023 by announcing the completion of our primary goal for the year! Thank you to everyone who helpfully participated in design, implementation, and stabilization discussions. Thanks also to the users of async Rust who have given great feedback over the years. We're looking forward to seeing what you build, and to delivering continued improvements in the years to come. Note that associated types can only be used in cases where the type is nameable. This restriction will be lifted once impl_trait_in_assoc_type is stabilized. ↩ Note that in that blog post we originally said we would solve the Send bound problem before shipping async fn in traits, but we decided to cut that from the scope and ship the trait-variant crate instead. ↩ This works because of auto-trait leakage, which allows knowledge of auto traits to \"leak\" from an item whose signature does not specify them. ↩ Get help!

I&#x27;m glad the team was able to ship a useful subset of the desired functionality. Yes the current implementation shipping next week has limitations, but they&#x27;re clearly marked, the compiler helpfully explains them and warns you away from some sharp edges.I&#x27;m glad the Rust project is willing to ship useful but limited features quickly, see how people use them, and then iterate and slowly remove the restrictions in the future. I think it&#x27;ll be more productive than taking another 3 years to solve all the remaining rough edges and problems. reply tempaccount420 13 hours agoparentIn general, Rust should commit more to stabilizing important features like this. I think because of how easy it is to switch to nightly, there isn&#x27;t as much pressure to stabilize features as there should be. reply gdcbe 17 hours agoprevCongratulations to all involved. Huge milestone!That said, I’ve been using it seriously on nightly for a while already… and must say its ergonomics are off putting.For example I maintain https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plabayo&#x2F;tower-async (a fork of tower), and on its own it looks to work (except for the boxing and dynamic dispatching others have already discussed).But once you throw it into the tokio ecosystem, building on top of something like hyper, and you suddenly are back into nightly territory due to having to specify trait bound for your async fn trait methods (eg: call(): Send).It works, and you can see in my early WIP proxy repo (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plabayo&#x2F;rama). It’s not pretty but does work… that said it does put you in a nightly position once again due to having to specify Send&#x2F;Sync trait bounds of trait async fn methods opaque futures…In contrast the RFC that would allow me to write ‘type Future = impl Future impl Future + Send; } impl HttpService for MyService { async fn fetch(&self, url: Url) -> HtmlBody { &#x2F;&#x2F; This works, as long as `do_fetch(): Send`! self.client.do_fetch(url).await.into_body() } } reply gdcbe 15 hours agorootparentOf course that works. But only as long as everything is always hardcoded as Send. Which is a known limitation, so no complaints.Edit: also the problem is about the method async returned future trait bounds, not the Self. reply tmandry 7 hours agoparentprevMy hope is that you can use Send variants generated with the macro to reduce the typing, in cases where you need that. In the future with return type bounds, middleware would just use the local variants and only the end user needs to specify the Send or Local variant. reply vlovich123 18 hours agoprevVery important milestone reached for async programming, not to mention that this is actually a primitive that just happens to be useful for async as well. It’s not always needed but when you find yourself needing it, it becomes a major point of friction. Congrats to the team! Excited for dynamic dispatch and capture rules to be coming soon. reply ForkMeOnTinder 17 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s useful even without async too. Our codebase has some trait methods that return boxed iterators and I&#x27;m very much looking forward to switching them to impl Iterator instead. reply Zuiii 15 hours agoprevDoes Rust still require you to rely on external dependencies (or roll out your own async runtime) to run async code? reply steveklabnik 15 hours agoparentYes, and that is unlikely to ever change. reply vlovich123 14 hours agorootparentBut it would be nice to standardize the IO &#x2F; time interfaces so that swapping out runtimes doesn&#x27;t require writing a custom adapter layer :). I know you know, just saying that&#x27;s really probably what OP meant. reply Zuiii 7 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s unfortunate. I hope this gets fixed. reply jrpelkonen 6 hours agorootparentCargo makes it rather seamless to include the async runtime that best suits your needs. I am curious why do you think this is a major issue? reply andy_xor_andrew 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;m confused about the example for trait_variant:``` #[trait_variant::make(HttpService: Send)] ... ```In the given example, they create a trait with an async fn that returns HtmlBody, then the trait_variant macro makes a duplicate version of the trait but additionally with a Send bound on the future. Makes sense, because users commonly need the future to be Send.But... what&#x27;s the point of having two traits? Could there not just be one trait, with the Send bound? Doesn&#x27;t the Send bound only increase the places it can be used? Are there scenarios where you need the future to not be Send? reply dureuill 18 hours agoparentIt increases the places it can be used, but it decreases what type can be returned. Not all types can be sent between threads (in particular, types that feature unsynchronized mutability through shared references are not Send). If you executor is local to one thread, it can be a blocker if a trait you use suddenly requires your future to be Send. reply andy_xor_andrew 18 hours agorootparentah, ok. so this is for scenarios where you, the library author, define the trait, and users will implement it. But since different users have different requirements, you provide two+ trait definitions, so they can pick if they need Send or not. reply Arnavion 15 hours agorootparentYes. Say the HttpService trait comes from some third-party library. I implement that trait on my server, and then I run my server on a single-threaded executor. (This is analogous to how Iterator is in libstd but I can implement it on my own type and then use that Iterator with a for-loop &#x2F; combinator in my own code.) My implementation returns Futures that are not Send and my executor does not need them to be Send, so it would be wasteful if the trait required the Futures to be Send. reply monocasa 17 hours agoprevWhat&#x27;s the timeline for allowing async fn with dynamic dispatch? reply duped 17 hours agoparentYou can do trait Trait { fn f(&self) -> futures::BoxFuture { let fut = async move { &#x2F;* ... *&#x2F; }; fut.boxed() } }(which is essentially what `#[async_trait]` desugars to)I&#x27;m not sure how you would even support dynamic dispatch in the general case without implicitly boxing the return value, which would be deeply unpopular within the Rust community and ecosystem. If we&#x27;re saying we&#x27;re ok with implicit allocations for futures then the whole \"zero cost abstraction\" of async&#x2F;await seems pointless. reply bbatha 16 hours agorootparentNote that an \"implicit allocation\" doesn&#x27;t need to be a heap allocation, it just needs to be dynamically sized. Stabilizing the allocator api (which seems tantalizingly close) and someway to pass a non-default allocator to the implicit box should cover zero cost sensitive folks.Also note that \"zero cost abstraction\" means that \"zero cost\" over implementing it by hand there is no way to return an owned dyn sized type in current rust. Syntax that returns a box is inherently zero cost because there&#x27;s no other way to spell it.C++ `co_await` also forces an allocation for similar reasons and lets the optimizer get rid of them in the static case which predictably is a mixed bag in practice; at least in rust you can guarantee the static sized version doesn&#x27;t allocate. That said I don&#x27;t like forcing an implicit allocation it feels against Rust&#x27;s ethos and the language will likely have to have better handling of dyn types writ large to get there. reply duped 16 hours agorootparentI agree this is basically an ABI problem. Stripping away the async issue this snippet highlights the issue: trait T { fn f(&self) -> impl U; } trait U { fn g(&self); } fn h(t: &dyn T) { &#x2F;&#x2F; What type is u? how big is it? let u = t.f(); &#x2F;&#x2F; How does this method resolve? u.g(); }If `U` is object safe, and `f()` returns something that is `Sized` then it&#x27;s possible to define a non-heap allocated `dyn U` that is essentially a tuple `(, )` and this code would desugar to something like fn h(t: &dyn T) { let u: (, ) = t.f(); u.0.g(&u.1); }But that kind of requires a special calling convention for `T::f` when invoked from a `dyn T` that also returns the size of its return type.edit: Thinking about it some more, what could be done is that functions called from a `dyn Trait` object that are `impl Trait` have a special calling convention where they return everything on the stack. Then callsites take the top of the stack + offset of the method as the function arg and stack + sizeof the method table as their `self` argument and everything else is fine.I&#x27;m not sure if LLVM supports this directly. I know some stack based language implementations and LISPs will do this to avoid writing register allocators so everything just gets dumped on the stack.Also there&#x27;s no way (afaik) in Rust to \"spell\" a non-heap allocated dyn Trait object. There&#x27;s bare `dyn Trait` but that means something else and is preserved for backwards compatibility, iirc. reply steveklabnik 15 hours agorootparent> Also there&#x27;s no way (afaik) in Rust to \"spell\" a non-heap allocated dyn Trait object.&dyn Trait is fine. let i: i32 = 5; let d = &i as &dyn Display; reply JoshTriplett 15 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s the current thinking on how to support dynamic dispatch without boxing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallcultfollowing.com&#x2F;babysteps&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;dyn... reply pitaj 16 hours agorootparentprevI guess the difference is that that isn&#x27;t an async function.

Any idea if removing the implicit box-ing that async_trait uses has a measurable impact on performance?Are there some cases, say with really big futures, where removing the boxing actually hurts performance? reply tmandry 8 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t have numbers handy, but I can say with confidence that the answer to both questions is \"yes\". It depends on the use case. Boxing is a useful tool and in many cases the overhead is minimal, but you don&#x27;t want to use it all the time. Likewise, static inlining can bite you in deeply nested cases and I&#x27;ve heard of this happening too.The future we&#x27;re working toward is for this to be a decision you can make locally without introducing compatibility hazards or having to change a bunch of code. Ideally, one day you can even ask the compiler to alert you to potential performance hazards or make reasonable default choices for you... reply andy_xor_andrew 18 hours agoprevthis is so cool :) one other question for async Rust experts...is it trivial to replace every use of the #[async_trait] with this, once it releases? async_trait was just a macro for adding a bunch of `Box + OtherJunk>` and so on and so on.Is async_trait entirely obsolete now, or are there still situations where async_trait must be used, where builtin async will not?edit: if I read one more paragraph I would have seen the answer, it&#x27;s right there in the post :) reply WhyNotHugo 17 hours agoparent`#[async_trait]` does dynamic dispatch, this approach does not.If you need to use something like `Box`, then you&#x27;ll want to continue using `#[async_trait]`. reply vlovich123 17 hours agoparentprevFor anyone looking for a TLDR, dynamic dispatch is the major missing piece.

    "title": "Google's \"Privacy Sandbox\" in Chrome: How to Disable Ad Tracking",
    "originLink": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/how-turn-googles-privacy-sandbox-ad-tracking-and-why-you-should",
    "originBody": "Google has rolled out \"Privacy Sandbox,\" a Chrome feature first announced back in 2019 that, among other things, exchanges third-party cookies—the most common form of tracking technology—for what the company is now calling \"Topics.\" Topics is a response to pushback against Google’s proposed Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), which we called \"a terrible idea\" because it gave Google even more control over advertising in its browser while not truly protecting user privacy. While there have been some changes to how this works since 2019, Topics is still tracking your internet use for Google’s behavioral advertising. If you use Chrome, you can disable this feature through a series of three confusing settings. With the version of the Chrome browser released in September 2023, Google tracks your web browsing history and generates a list of advertising \"topics\" based on the web sites you visit. This works as you might expect. At launch there are almost 500 advertising categories—like \"Student Loans & College Financing,\" \"Parenting,\" or \"Undergarments\"—that you get dumped into based on whatever you're reading about online. A site that supports Privacy Sandbox will ask Chrome what sorts of things you're supposedly into, and then display an ad accordingly. The idea is that instead of the dozens of third-party cookies placed on websites by different advertisers and tracking companies, Google itself will track your interests in the browser itself, controlling even more of the advertising ecosystem than it already does. Google calls this “enhanced ad privacy,” perhaps leaning into the idea that starting in 2024 they plan to “phase out” the third-party cookies that many advertisers currently use to track people. But the company will still gobble up your browsing habits to serve you ads, preserving its bottom line in a world where competition on privacy is pushing it to phase out third-party cookies. Google plans to test Privacy Sandbox throughout 2024. Which means that for the next year or so, third-party cookies will continue to collect and share your data in Chrome. The new Topics improves somewhat over the 2019 FLoC. It does not use the FLoC ID, a number that many worried would be used to fingerprint you. The ad-targeting topics are all public on GitHub, hopefully avoiding any clearly sensitive categories such as race, religion, or sexual orientation. Chrome's ad privacy controls, which we detail below, allow you to see what sorts of interest categories Chrome puts you in, and remove any topics you don't want to see ads for. There's also a simple means to opt out, which FLoC never really had during testing. Other browsers, like Firefox and Safari, baked in privacy protections from third-party cookies in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Neither of those browsers has anything like Privacy Sandbox, which makes them better options if you'd prefer more privacy. Google referring to any of this as “privacy” is deceiving. Even if it's better than third-party cookies, the Privacy Sandbox is still tracking, it's just done by one company instead of dozens. Instead of waffling between different tracking methods, even with mild improvements, we should work towards a world without behavioral ads. But if you're sticking to Chrome, you can at least turn these features off. How to Disable Privacy Sandbox Depending on when you last updated Chrome, you may have already received a pop-up asking you to agree to “Enhanced ad privacy in Chrome.” If you just clicked the big blue button that said “Got it” to make the pop-up go away, you opted yourself in. But you can still get back to the opt out page easily enough by clicking the Three-dot icon (⋮) > Settings > Privacy & Security > Ad Privacy page. Here you'll find this screen with three different settings: Ad topics: This is the fundamental component of Privacy Sandbox that generates a list of your interests based on the websites you visit. If you leave this enabled, you'll eventually get a list of all your interests, which are used for ads, as well as the ability to block individual topics. The topics roll over every four weeks (up from weekly in the FLOCs proposal) and random ones will be thrown in for good measure. You can disable this entirely by setting the toggle to \"Off.\" Site-suggested ads: This confusingly named toggle is what allows advertisers to do what’s called \"remarketing\" or \"retargeting,\" also known as “after I buy a sofa, every website on the internet advertises that same sofa to me.” With this feature, site one gives information to your Chrome instance (like “this person loves sofas”) and site two, which runs ads, can interact with Chrome such that a sofa ad will be shown, even without site two learning that you love sofas. Disable this by setting the toggle to \"Off.\" Ad measurement: This allows advertisers to track ad performance by storing data in your browser that's then shared with other sites. For example, if you see an ad for a pair of shoes, the site would get information about the time of day, whether the ad was clicked, and where it was displayed. Disable this by setting the toggle to \"Off.\" If you're on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Opera, you should also take your privacy protections a step further with our own Privacy Badger, a browser extension that blocks third-party trackers that use cookies, fingerprinting, and other sneaky methods. On Chrome, Privacy Badger also disables the Topics API by default.",

Compared to ublock origin, which has 7,388,295 and thus is at least within 2% of all users. replyheavyset_go 9 hours agorootparentprevThe more people that use Firefox, the more revenue Mozilla will earn as there are various ancillary services they sell and integrate into Firefox, along with things like sponsor links. reply ls612 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve switched to Firefox after a long time on Chrome in preparation to avoid the Manifest V3 changes and it isn&#x27;t all sunshine and rainbows.

I completely excised them from my life almost a decade ago already.I’m simply freeing people from the illusion that Google has “won the web” or whatever. Google is effectively giving everyone a free ride with Chromium. They aren’t forcing anyone onto Chrome (where the real tracking happens), and if they did by making Chromium private from now on, again, forks and upstream swaps would happen at lightspeed. reply freeAgent 7 hours agorootparentprevHow much more evil do you want Google to get before it’s problematic that they control the portal through which most people interact with the web (both browser&#x2F;engine and search)? And why not use Firefox (or Safari&#x2F;WebKit) already? reply jorvi 5 hours agorootparent> And why not use Firefox (or Safari&#x2F;WebKit) already?Mozilla these days seems more happy at pumping out tech-woke messages rather than being privacy first. Hell, they’ve refused to add an adblocker to their iOS browser for years now.3rd party WebKit browsers are more rare, thus less well-developed.I’ve settled on using Brave. reply trinsic2 5 hours agorootparentI like Brave, but I cant recommend it to my less-than-techie friends because of the bullshit that you have go through to disable (VPN, Wallet, advert related stuff, etc), which confuses people and gets in the way. reply jorvi 4 hours agorootparentYeah I agree it is annoying, but ultimately browser dev needs to be paid for somehow.Brave does it via their extras.

We are not protesting that Google is doing it, but more the general fact that it is done. reply insanitybit 9 hours agoparentprevWhat does a \"free\" internet look like without ads? Serious question, because right now ads pay for a lot. Ads are why we have reddit and twitter - two sites that I think a lot of people like.Ads are why I could run a wordpress blog as a young student.If you assume \"the current internet is good, but we want to improve privacy\" what Google is doing makes sense. Advertisers can still say \"ok that person likes cars I&#x27;ll show them cars\" but they can&#x27;t actually track that person or attribute information to them other than \"likes cars\". reply stubish 8 hours agorootparentEven today, a Wordpress blog costs about as much as a coffee per month.

Maybe more like when I was a student, and stuff got put up because people were interested rather than as a side hustle. Perhaps cheap subscriptions or microtransactions for quality, curated content such as news services, because they no longer have to compete with free crap.

I&#x27;m all for this. Give me a new business model that doesn&#x27;t involve ads and let people choose. Go for it. But maybe let&#x27;s not break the entire internet before we even have an idea of what that will look like? reply ndriscoll 7 hours agorootparentWhen I was a teenager, I found and installed Apache. WordPress apparently had existed for a year or two, but I didn&#x27;t hear about it for several years after. I memorized my IP address and would link people to that, and never bought a hostname or anything.If you just want to host a blog and maybe dabble in PHP, Apache works great. These days as an adult who programs professionally, my personal site is just a directory that I point nginx to with xhtml&#x2F;xslt&#x2F;css files that I hand edit + things like photos. I do have a domain name these days, but it&#x27;s not like you need one. If you wanted something to be permanent to avoid link rot, you should want browsers to support ipfs so you could use that. reply insanitybit 3 hours agorootparentCan we agree that \"must be able to install apache\" is not a good requirement for adding content to the web? reply 0xDEADFED5 5 hours agorootparentprevthere&#x27;s always dynamic dns, too reply bee_rider 5 hours agorootparentMaybe someday ipv6 will become widespread and we can all have thousands of static IP addresses. reply hutzlibu 7 hours agorootparentprevWikipedia is not funded by ads for example.

Google has enough market share that they can just make their own standards and everyone else just follows. I have repeatedly come across sites that don&#x27;t even test on Firefox because Chrome is just the default now.If you don&#x27;t want to be cornered into a single option that invades your privacy, now is the time to pay attention. reply insanitybit 9 hours agorootparentI know what they&#x27;re saying. I&#x27;m asking what the internet is going to look like when there&#x27;s no advertising, and I&#x27;m pointing out what advertising currently allows for.> Google has enough market share that they can just make their own standards and everyone else just followsWhat does that have to do with privacy or advertising?> invades your privacyI&#x27;m comfortable with a company seeing \" likes cars\" tbh reply spookie 9 hours agorootparentThe problem here comes from Google being the ones who monopolise on the user data, leading them to be the only credible source of truth on the user interests. This is an outstanding move from them, business wise.I agree that I prefer, privacy wise, to only deal with one company. But, this leaves them in a considerable advantage. It&#x27;s ultimately, bad for consumers. And, from the beginning, bad for other businesses and market. reply insanitybit 9 hours agorootparentBut Google doesn&#x27;t get the user data, right? Chrome is just conveying it to advertisers - Google gets the same experience as everyone else.It&#x27;s not like it goes to Google first and then it goes to advertisers. Chrome is what decides which data leaves the browser. Or have I misunderstood? reply agwa 8 hours agorootparentCorrect, with the caveat that if you have Chrome profile sync enabled (without a sync passphrase set) then the advertising data tracked by Chrome likely gets uploaded unencrypted to Google-operated servers. I don&#x27;t know if their privacy policy permits them to look at this data, or if they would look at it in practice. reply insanitybit 8 hours agorootparentHm. All of my sync data is encrypted. Is that not the default? reply agwa 8 hours agorootparentNope. See the following page for some screenshots of the UI to turn on encryption with sync passphrases: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;palant.info&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;chrome-sync-privacy-is-still-... reply insanitybit 8 hours agorootparentThanks. I hope they enable that by default at some point. replycool_dude85 9 hours agorootparentprevYou set up a false equivalence. Why is the choice between these kinds of features, which lock Google in as the sole controller of online advertising, and no advertising? reply insanitybit 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m setting that up, but maybe I&#x27;m not understanding. Because to me what Google is doing is a clear attempt at maintaining the status quo of an ad-funded internet while removing the ability for fine-grained 3rd party tracking.So when people say this is a threat to the \"free internet\" I&#x27;m asking what that means - because right now the status quo has a lot of upsides, a few of which I listed. I want to hear what the alternatives are. What is it people are asking for?What&#x27;s the implementation of this that you think would be better? reply lelandbatey 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a threat to the \"free\" (as in freedom) internet in that with this as the tracking mechanism, Google via Chrome is directly tracking your interests. It effectively makes \"serves you ads and tracks your interests\" a core part of what it means for a browser (Chrome) to be a browser.Many folks feel like this is a capitalism-flavored move on par with \"all phones should track the bad behavior of their owners and report it to the government.\" The point is that it hands over a lot of control.What if Google decides to expand the topics to include things like \"seeking reproductive care\" in a state like Texas? Could that be used to try to target folks seeking abortions, potentially with legal action?

    "originBody": "Making Siri smarter — Apple wants AI to run directly on its hardware instead of in the cloud iPhone maker wants to catch up to its rivals when it comes to AI. Tim Bradshaw, Financial Times - 12/21/2023, 2:43 PM Enlarge / The iPhone 15 Pro. Apple reader comments 154 Apple’s latest research about running large language models on smartphones offers the clearest signal yet that the iPhone maker plans to catch up with its Silicon Valley rivals in generative artificial intelligence. The paper, entitled “LLM in a Flash,” offers a “solution to a current computational bottleneck,” its researchers write. Its approach “paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory,” they said. Inference refers to how large language models, the large data repositories that power apps like ChatGPT, respond to users’ queries. Chatbots and LLMs normally run in vast data centers with much greater computing power than an iPhone. The paper was published on December 12 but caught wider attention after Hugging Face, a popular site for AI researchers to showcase their work, highlighted it late on Wednesday. It is the second Apple paper on generative AI this month and follows earlier moves to enable image-generating models such as Stable Diffusion to run on its custom chips. Device manufacturers and chipmakers are hoping that new AI features will help revive the smartphone market, which has had its worst year in a decade, with shipments falling an estimated 5 percent, according to Counterpoint Research. Despite launching one of the first virtual assistants, Siri, back in 2011, Apple has been largely left out of the wave of excitement about generative AI that has swept through Silicon Valley in the year since OpenAI launched its breakthrough chatbot ChatGPT. Apple has been viewed by many in the AI community as lagging behind its Big Tech rivals, despite hiring Google’s top AI executive, John Giannandrea, in 2018. While Microsoft and Google have largely focused on delivering chatbots and other generative AI services over the Internet from their vast cloud computing platforms, Apple’s research suggests that it will instead focus on AI that can run directly on an iPhone. Apple’s rivals, such as Samsung, are gearing up to launch a new kind of “AI smartphone” next year. Counterpoint estimated more than 100 million AI-focused smartphones would be shipped in 2024, with 40 percent of new devices offering such capabilities by 2027. Advertisement The head of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker, Qualcomm chief executive Cristiano Amon, forecast that bringing AI to smartphones would create a whole new experience for consumers and reverse declining mobile sales. “You’re going to see devices launch in early 2024 with a number of generative AI use cases,” he told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “As those things get scaled up, they start to make a meaningful change in the user experience and enable new innovation which has the potential to create a new upgrade cycle in smartphones.” More sophisticated virtual assistants will be able to anticipate users’ actions such as texting or scheduling a meeting, he said, while devices will also be capable of new kinds of photo editing techniques. Google this month unveiled a version of its new Gemini LLM that will run “natively” on its Pixel smartphones. Running the kind of large AI model that powers ChatGPT or Google’s Bard on a personal device brings formidable technical challenges, because smartphones lack the huge computing resources and energy available in a data center. Solving this problem could mean that AI assistants respond more quickly than they do from the cloud and even work offline. Ensuring that queries are answered on an individual’s own device without sending data to the cloud is also likely to bring privacy benefits, a key differentiator for Apple in recent years. “Our experiment is designed to optimize inference efficiency on personal devices,” its researchers said. Apple tested its approach on models including Falcon 7B, a smaller version of an open source LLM originally developed by the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi. Optimizing LLMs to run on battery-powered devices has been a growing focus for AI researchers. Academic papers are not a direct indicator of how Apple intends to add new features to its products, but they offer a rare glimpse into its secretive research labs and the company’s latest technical breakthroughs. “Our work not only provides a solution to a current computational bottleneck but also sets a precedent for future research,” wrote Apple’s researchers in the conclusion to their paper. “We believe as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, approaches like this work will be essential for harnessing their full potential in a wide range of devices and applications.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. reader comments 154 Advertisement Channel Ars Technica ← Previous story Next story → Related Stories Today on Ars",

Yesterday when driving I got a message and usually it would just say \"Jane says &#x27;blah blah&#x27; and sent a photo.\" But last night Siri in CarPlay said \"Jane says &#x27;blah blah&#x27; and sent a photo of a dog in a blanket on a couch\". And when I checked the photo they sent it was exactly that.If it&#x27;s E2E encrypted, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be able to identify that during transit, so it had to have been locally done.Thought it was interesting, and a nice QoL update. Excited to see how this can grow if they introduce more things to be processed with AI on the hardware. reply bayindirh 12 hours agoparentI love how Apple obsessively does things on the edge, on the device itself rather than on the cloud.Sometimes my lowly iPhone X gets super hot during charging.

They are barely getting started on the integration.OpenAI has been talking about AGI as it lines up commercial partners across the globe and up and down the stack. But AGI is no more realistic than crypto taking over from central banks. It&#x27;s possible in theory, but not in fact.Meanwhile, Apple has had neural processors on devices for 4+ years; AI features have figured in every subsequent marketing campaign.

I wouldn’t even consider any kind of phone or camera without that feature, now that I’ve experienced it.[edit] context of how good it is: some days back there was a link here that went to an image with a bunch of text on it. I followed the link, read it, and did my usual compulsive-text-selection thing I do when reading on the web.I didn’t realize I’d been looking at an image, rather than html, until I came back to the thread and read complaints about it.

And I can basically guarantee something would happen and there would be claims about how “Apple protects child molesters”. It’s just too juicy, and we saw the ones about Apple protecting terrorists by not unlocking phones.So I think they tried to come up with a solution.

It&#x27;s always to the parking lot near the office on Monday and Wednesday morning, daycare to pick up the youngest on the way back, swimming pool on Saturday, etc. etc. but navigating to those addresses is always a pain (even selecting it from recent addresses in CarPlay) and it did sent me to the same street as the daycare in a completely different town several times now.While I value not giving more data to google, after three months I decided it simply wasn&#x27;t worth it.

I also am not sure that recording will reliably survive device sleep and automatic app shutdown because of memory pressure)I think #1 is fine. It doesn’t seem fair to me that Apple should be forced to allow other developers link “Hey Siri” to their voice assistant because that assistant may be detrimental to the value of the “Hey Siri” mark or Apple’s values, for example because it is racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.The second IMO isn’t fine, but I can see Apple argue they are in their rights to have some control over how that rigger phrase gets detected. “Hey Siri” uses a small on-device network specifically trained for that, in order to conserve battery life (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;hey-siri), and they may argue having good battery life is essential to their brand. reply drexlspivey 13 hours agorootparentprevIs Apple going to ship these LLMs as part of the OS?

And it also understands “set a timer for 6” similarly.And Siri doesn’t seem at all intelligent about when to stop transcribing.So Siri has a rather large chance of interpreting “set a timer for 5 minutes” as “set a timer for 5” and ending up with utter nonsense.A LLM that jointly handles language and audio might do much better. reply n9 11 hours agorootparentSomething&#x27;s not right.

Apple is playing a game where they try to add enough features to prevent the upgrade cycle from becoming too long. Encourage people with 2 or 3 year old phones to upgrade this cycle instead of delaying a generation.Honestly, Apple&#x27;s business model is harder if everyone wants to upgrade to a certain new version.

A feature for the people who have an iPhone 8 or 9 who say “why would I upgrade, my current phone is fine”.If you can use this tech to make a feature that they really want you can trigger upgrades that otherwise may not happen for many more years. We’ve seen that before with things like when Apple first released a bigger phone. That triggered a LOT of “early” upgrades that wouldn’t have otherwise happened. reply tech_ken 13 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s an interesting point, so more of a game of amortizing upgrades over a few years rather than instigating a massive one-off purchasing craze. I could see how a drip of sufficiently useful AI features and improvements over like &#x27;24-&#x27;27 would bolster the market. Even then though, this seems like an opportunity to hold rather than really reverse the trend; at some point I think Apple is going to have to reckon with the fact that the market is more or less saturated, though I could definitely be wrong here. reply hx8 12 hours agorootparentApple knows the cell phone market is saturated. That&#x27;s why they have iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, MacBook Airs, etc. Their plan is to create new accessories (and services) that pair with the iPhone. This generates a moat around existing iPhone users. reply tech_ken 12 hours agorootparentI guess if they start layering LLMs or similar into their service or accessory interop stack I could see how having the phone running the model could be a big win for latency and availability.

I understand that not everyone feels this way, but from the perspective of market adoption I don&#x27;t see the average user caring too much whether a prompt is kept local or sent to the cloud (if encrypted or similar).

That&#x27;s true, and it also has performance rationale when network latency makes online&#x2F;cloud-inference non-viable for some use cases. Google and Apple have been promoting on-device inference&#x2F;hardware accelerated AI&#x2F;ML processing for several years, and with Google this goes back as early as Pixel 2.However, a big factor motivating these companies to promote \"on-device\" inference is the operating cost.While the compute and data requirements for training many models exceed the resources of almost everyone but these titans, it is still expected that when these models will be used for inference, and the total costs of inference over time, will far exceed the cost of training. reply conjecTech 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve noticed that despite Apple&#x27;s stated on-device aspirations, they&#x27;ve put very little incremental die space toward the neural engine in the most recent generations. I think there&#x27;s a number of possible explanations for the disconnect. Curious if anyone with a better perspective knows which are true.1) They think the existing hardware is powerful enough.2) The utilization of the ANE doesn&#x27;t justify increased resources.3) They plan to re-generalize AI compute through things like vector operations.4) (the most pessimistic) They are saving large increases for future releases when they need to force upgrades.I could see the math for on-device just not working for things like massive LLMs. The amount of silicon you&#x27;d need to make it possible would be large, and the frequency of use low. The same silicon for one person&#x27;s phone could likely support dozens if it were in a datacenter instead. reply dotancohen 29 minutes agoparentI wonder if there will be a separate product line, e.g. iPhoneAI or aIphone, that will have the necessary hardware upgrades with corresponding jump in price, to not have such a cost hit across their entire lineup when the cloud model will do fine for most people. reply ip26 12 hours agoparentprevThere wasn&#x27;t a \"killer app\" for on-die AI accelerators until roughly this March. Until about nine months ago, the only widely-discussed ideas were re-aiming pupils to make your video call feel more natural, and applying background filters.So today&#x27;s on-die AI accelerators were, as far as I can tell, a cautious bet. It turns out caution was warranted, because LLM&#x27;s need large amounts of memory bandwidth and capacity far more than they need a specialized neural compute engine. reply TillE 13 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not clear on what precisely the Neural Engine can do, but Apple has put plenty of resources into improving their GPUs, which can definitely do compute well (see eg, MacWhisper). reply conjecTech 13 hours agorootparentYeah, it could be that they plan to do #3 through use of their chunky GPUs. There is definitely a lot of focus on the whole APU concept. From look at some of the dies and what projects like ggml have been able to do through mixed computation, I&#x27;m guessing the neural engine is ~3-5x the throughput&#x2F;area vs GPU for the kinds of operations its doing.Trying to map neural nets onto graphics seems reasonable, but personally I would bet on neuralizing graphics to be the better strategy long term. reply madrox 13 hours agoprevThis is the possibility I&#x27;m most excited for in the AI space.

GPTs are super capable but I don&#x27;t see them generating arbitrary webpages without at least fetching some basic resources from another machine somewhere. Like if a restaurant updates its menu, that data needs to make its way to the model in one way or another before it can generate their webpage. At the very least I think the \"website\" might change from an HTML page to an engineered prompt that gets served to you and which generates the page locally.

The human brain is 8 times heavier. reply filterfiber 13 hours agoparent> still run on a device like the iPhone, which weights about 170g [1]? The human brain is 8 times heavier.Why are you comparing the weight? I&#x27;m sorry but this is a bizarre comparison. This isn&#x27;t even apples to oranges, this is apples to a telephone pole.I&#x27;ll also throw in that a single Nvidia H100 is 1200 grams. Unless you have a \"Bracket with screws\" which will add 20 grams (who wouldn&#x27;t want an extra 20grams of intelligence?).Like 70%+ of the human brain is water. The human brain needs a massive network of systems to transport nutrients&#x2F;oxygen which is irrelevant to logical processing.Similarly the majority of the iphone weight is the battery and frame. The weight of the processing chip is _grams_.Besides the conflicting variables with the weight, the way that ML works on a physical level is completely different from the human brain. reply acchow 13 hours agoparentprevThe iPhone 15 neural engine does 35Tflops, which is about on par with the fastest supercomputer from 2002.Maybe in 24 years the iPhone 39 will have the computing power that OpenAI has today? Hopefully our compression gets much better in the meantime. reply fumar 13 hours agoparentprevDid our brains optimize for size, weight, and or power efficiency? reply nerdbert 10 hours agorootparentAlmost certainly, yes.But they also have to carry around their resource gathering and self-repair systems, something phones don&#x27;t have to worry about. reply MBCook 4 hours agorootparentThey also optimized for what we need to actually do, not the kind of “AI“ computers currently perform. reply jelled 13 hours agoprevI expect that locally installed models will quickly resemble how we think about drivers today. In the short term you&#x27;ll install a notes app that requires Mixtral-8x7B so you pull that in through ollama. Down the line all operating systems will ship with various models preinstalled. reply ardel95 12 hours agoprevI think Apple is fully capable of getting there too. They have a high enough price point, and a loyal enough customer base, that even if getting there required additional hardware or shipping with more RAM by default, they could make it work. reply cmarschner 12 hours agoprevThe metal support for pytorch is a real sh*t show at this point - all APIs are either legacy or unfinished. Also, app memory is about 3GB even for the largest phones. It really still feels that it‘s all in its infancies. reply MBCook 4 hours agoparentApple already has their own environment in CoreML and the neural engine. They have ways to train&#x2F;run models on it in highly optimized formats and unified memory.PyTorch came from PCs running on GPUs with their own pool of dedicated memory and a slower link to main memory.I know people have been speeding it up a lot on Apple processors, but I’m not sure it’s a good indicator of how ready the iPhone is for running models for end user programs. reply paxys 12 hours agoprevGemini Nano is on it way. Various other 3B-7B models are getting small and efficient enough to run on consumer hardware. It has been clear for a while that the \"edge\" is the new frontier for LLMs. reply fennecbutt 9 hours agoprevPretty sure every device manufacturer wants this too. Cloud services for AI are expensive and are realistically loss leaders to sell devices. reply zmmmmm 12 hours agoprevWell of course they do, they have 0% of the cloud hardware market and a gigantic percentage of the phone market. They like money, after all. reply J_Shelby_J 12 hours agoprevThat’s nice.Anyways, i had fun building a Linux server to stick an nvidia GPU in. I’m sure it’s going to be pretty common over the next few years as devs realize they can’t just do everything with a MacBook. (Or maybe apple will add support for 3rd party GPUs like they had with the intel MacBooks)This was my take away from the apple AR headset; it doesn’t matter how nice the UX is if it lacks the compute to do anything interesting… and AR&#x2F;VR takes a LOT of compute. reply MBCook 4 hours agoparentSure no one‘s going to be running 16 gig models on their iPhone anytime soon. And my $1500 MacBook is not gonna compete with a dedicated $2000 Nvidia card drawing hundreds of watts.But you don’t need all that. There’s must be tons of great uses that would benefit me as a user that don’t have requirements that steep.My devices will never compete with a data center, there will always be things that have to be hosted elsewhere. But there’s still benefit to be had. reply 1-6 12 hours agoprevI thought more people already knew about this. It’s quite evident when you see their product announcements. reply thih9 12 hours agoprevI guess this looks moat shaped.And seems to be aligned well with Apple too: their focus on privacy, their hardware performance gains, their ai assistant products.Apple is good at launching new product categories, ahead of competition. The apple watch had no competition for the first couple of years after launch, ipads are a class of its own, I wonder if they’re planning a similar move with ai too. reply MBCook 4 hours agoparentIt could end up a very big advantage.Apple has been using their Neural Engine for a couple of years now, and it’s obviously been noticed. Other companies are now starting to include similar blocks in their CPUs.They could be a match or even better, or they could end up looking like an old integrated graphics card against a discrete GPU.Time will tell us how much of a difference all of this makes. reply carabiner 11 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s still amazing how much ML already does on iPhone.

These all seem problematic beyond the standard open crawl type datasets. They don’t have a web search corpus. reply MBCook 4 hours agorootparentThey could’ve gotten a corpus somehow. Maybe they licensed it from someone, maybe they do have a crawler.It’s a very good question though. That could make all the difference, huh. reply TechRemarker 14 hours agoprevOf course they “want” it to just like they want Siri and everything else to be computed locally since best for privacy and offline performance. Whether they compete with a cloud AI time will tell. Will presumably be far more limited than ChatGPT 4 but hopefully light years better than Siri which is what is most important. reply theshrike79 13 hours agoparentYou can make a local model contact the cloud for specific questions like current events.You can&#x27;t make a cloud model work 100% locally for privacy or during connection issues. reply GenericPoster 13 hours agoparentprev> Whether they compete with a cloud AI time will tell.But they&#x27;re not competing with cloud AI. Why would a person need to go to the cloud to give you a reminder or download an app?

    "originBody": "Hot Pod/ Creators/ Tech New York’s attorney general says SiriusXM’s annoying cancellation process is actually illegal New York’s attorney general says SiriusXM’s annoying cancellation process is actually illegal / The suit claims that the company ‘deliberately wastes its subscribers’ time.’ By Ariel Shapiro, lead reporter of Hot Pod, a newsletter covering podcasting and the audio industry. She previously worked at Forbes, where she covered media and entertainment. Dec 21, 2023, 4:26 PM UTC| Share this story Image: SiriusXM SiriusXM is getting sued by the state of New York for making it too difficult for subscribers to cancel their plans. The suit claims that customers who want to cancel are required to chat over the phone or online with an agent who bombards them with questions and offers. “Sirius deliberately wastes its subscribers’ time even though it has the ability to process cancellations with the click of a button,” the suit reads. Attorney General Letitia James’ office claims that SiriusXM’s own data reveals that it takes subscribers an average of 11.5 minutes to cancel by phone, and 30 minutes to cancel online. The suit is seeking damages for affected customers, as well as a $5,000 penalty to the state of New York for each violation. “Having to endure a lengthy and frustrating process to cancel a subscription is a stressful burden no one looks forward to, and when companies make it hard to cancel subscriptions, it’s illegal,” James said in a statement. “Consumers should be able to cancel a subscription they no longer use or need without any issues, and companies have a legal duty to make their cancellation process easy.” Clearly, some people have managed to endure SiriusXM’s cancellation process. The company reported a drop of 336,000 subscribers to its flagship satellite radio service in the first nine months of 2023. “It’s telling that the New York Attorney General issued a press release before providing SiriusXM with a copy of the complaint,” SiriusXM spokesperson Jessica Casano-Antonellis said in a statement. “Like a number of consumer businesses, we offer a variety of options for customers to sign up for or cancel their SiriusXM subscription and, upon receiving and reviewing the complaint, we intend to vigorously defend against these baseless allegations that grossly mischaracterize SiriusXM’s practices.” The long-term trend away from broadcast means that SiriusXM has had to get creative about its future. Aside from the alleged cancellation gymnastics, the company has invested heavily in podcasting. It bought Stitcher in 2020 for $325 million and Conan O’Brien’s production company in 2022 for $150 million, and it handed out lucrative distribution deals to top podcasts Crime Junkie and Pod Save America. Additionally, the company debuted its modernized new app last month that looks and acts much more like Spotify. Hot Pod / News and analysis on the biggest events in audio.

They wanted me to cancel by going into the gym… during the COVID lockdowns. reply m463 7 hours agoparentprevI had a gym membership that i couldn&#x27;t cancel over the phone, they required a certified letter to hq requesting cancellation. reply beretguy 15 hours agoparentprevReplace your payment card with privacy.com card and pause payments. Wait until gym will reach out to you for nonpayment. Then cancel. reply myself248 13 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t work. I tried this with a NYTimes trial-rate subscription, to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t renew at the $exorbitant rate.Apparently there&#x27;s a thing called a \"force post\" that the merchant can do, which blasts right through Privacy.com&#x27;s veil. I didn&#x27;t understand this until they explained it to me:> From: Sigourney (Privacy)> Jun 1, 2022, 5:21 PM EDT > Hi, [Name]> I&#x27;ve been reviewing your dispute and wanted to touch base with you to explain what happened.> It appears that the disputed charge is a \"force post\" by the merchant. This happens when a merchant cannot collect funds for a transaction after repeated attempts and completes the transaction without an authorization — it&#x27;s literally an unauthorized transaction that&#x27;s against payment card network rules. It&#x27;s a pretty sneaky move used by some merchants, and unfortunately, it&#x27;s not something Privacy can block.> We are refunding the transaction to the original funding source used for this purchase. You should see this refund reflected in your bank statement in the next 5 business days. However, please note that since this merchant uses force posts, they will continue to do this monthly until the subscription is cancelled. Please contact them to have the subscription cancelled.> Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!Okay, so Privacy refunded it, and I&#x27;m not clear whether they ate that cost or if they pulled some lever to claw-back the money from the NYT, but the fact that this is even possible in the first place is alarming, and it completely shattered my idea of what Privacy.com is even good for. reply gruez 13 hours agorootparentDid you deactivate&#x2F;close the card or only pause&#x2F;lock the card? If it&#x27;s deactivated, I&#x27;m not sure how they can go after you. Sure, for a service like privacy.com the card itself is attached to someone, so there&#x27;s theoretically someone to go after, but prepaid card exists as well. If you \"force post\" a transaction on those cards, who&#x27;s going to be on the hook? The bank? reply myself248 3 hours agorootparentIt wasn&#x27;t a prepaid, it was the standard privacy.com thing as suggested by the grandparent post, where they make a new number that you can use per-merchant. The card was set to a $6&#x2F;mo limit, so the $4&#x2F;mo trial offer would work, and the $25&#x2F;mo after that wouldn&#x27;t.They somehow sucked $25 right through that. reply ceejayoz 13 hours agorootparentprevGym contracts are often set up so this results in the account going to collections for either the remaining monthly fees or the cancellation fee. reply nucleardog 5 hours agorootparentYeah stopping payment doesn’t nullify the contract you signed.This is all like trying to cancel an apartment lease by not paying your rent for a few months.You might get lucky and they decide it’s not worth it to pursue it, but they still have a legal claim to that money. reply Cthulhu_ 13 hours agorootparentprevThey charge your card because legally you owe them.

Even if the designated cancellation process ought to be illegal, you still have to end the contract to end your legal obligations. reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of a company that sent their unpaid bills on disputed invoices to debt collection and I just took it to court and won. Note that the debt collectors also don&#x27;t like buying disputed debt so if enough people took them to court they&#x27;d stop doing this. But if enough people fold then it&#x27;s worth it for them to try. So don&#x27;t fold.

But if you actually visited the gym a few times and made use of their service, I doubt any judge would follow that logic. reply akomtu 13 hours agorootparentLA Fitness won&#x27;t stand a chance in a court. You&#x27;d show the judge a email demanding to cancel the subscription, and LAF will show a scammy \"terms of service\" implying you can&#x27;t easily cancel. That&#x27;s why scammy companies like this want binding arbitration and try to avoid any real scrutiny. reply xg15 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m absolutely with you that their games around cancelling are beyond shitty and hopefully illegal - but my point was that those are two orthogonal legal matters and it&#x27;s not a good idea to start playing games of your own if you suspect the other to do so.In this case, your argument was that you never had a contract with them in the first place. But this would be hard to believe if you actually used their services. Your cancellation email would undermine this argument even more, as you don&#x27;t request cancellation if you don&#x27;t have a contract.So a court could perfectly well decide that the gym acted in breach of the law by making it deliberately hard to cancel, but that you acted in breach of the law too by stopping payment without even trying to cancel.If you argue that you made your best effort to cancel, as documented by the email, that would be a more convincing argument I think (not a lawyer tho) but that&#x27;s a different argument than claiming there never was a contract at all. reply akomtu 8 hours agorootparentMy email would say that I&#x27;m no longer visiting the gym and they must stop charging my card, and to avoid confusion, I&#x27;m stopping the payments on my end. I actually did exactly this many years ago with another sleazy gym, and it worked.Obviously, nowhere in the communications with the gym I&#x27;d acknowledge there is any contract. It&#x27;s no different than going to a grocery store: just because I&#x27;ve been using it for years doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s any contract, even if the grocery stores believes so. replykaibee 15 hours agorootparentprevThey can&#x2F;will send you to collections. reply Modified3019 15 hours agorootparentprevI’m a huge fan of privacy.com’s virtual cards.

Well this must may as well be a class in Entomological Evolution because as soon as Consumerus Cardioworkii evolves a thicker exoskeleton against Gymnascus Financialus Capitalus, spc. Captialus evolves a defense against credit cards and goes checking-account only. reply chasd00 14 hours agoparentprevi got in a situation like this once with a saas company.

Fitness), said I lost my job as the reason, and they let me cancel. Maybe that was a fluke, maybe it&#x27;s different now, I just want to share counterpoints to \"X is impossible\", because it&#x27;s not always the case.Somewhat tangent, but everyone says \"nvidia doesn&#x27;t play nicely on Linux\", I&#x27;ve never seen that!

It might be time for a different database vendor.)3) \"You really don&#x27;t want to switch to fiber. Cable has a higher signal strength because it&#x27;s electrical instead of optical.\" (I... guess that&#x27;s true. 0 coulombs of charge pass through the fiber optic cable each second, which is much lower than any other technology!)There was also something in there about how I don&#x27;t really want symmetric Internet because asymmetric is better. That one I actually argued with; I have no argument for their database being out of date but them trusting it, or the signal strength thing... but uploading fast is actually important to me. I mentioned that I write software for a living and he didn&#x27;t press me that much on it, which was nice.This article reminds me that I need to write to the FTC.

I don&#x27;t know how to handle this in the general case but for things like cancelling a subscription, making a warranty claim or fixing some other service issue that isn&#x27;t the customer&#x27;s fault the company should be required to pay for any time spent. You ask me 30min of questions before letting me unsubscribe? I look forward to my $50 in the mail next week. My warranty claim requires 3 calls and 2h to resolve? I&#x27;ll take $200.Obviously implementing this would be super difficult. What if the customer talks slowly or ambiguously to get more money? But I feel that the core idea has merit.

XM had spent most of their time getting quality PM and on air talent, Sirius was basically a glorified Winamp playlist.

They never responded to that form, and presumably they will claim that because the service was shut down within 30 days of that second form being completed, they have no obligations to provide the data anymore.Pretty scummy stuff. reply tacticalturtle 15 hours agoparentSiriusXM doesn’t operate in Europe - so I don’t think GDPR is among their concerns.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.siriusxm.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;service-outside-us reply chimeracoder 15 hours agorootparent> SiriusXM doesn’t operate in Europe - so why would they care about GDPR?SiriusXM is a holding company that operates many products, some of which are sold in Europe, and in California, so as a company they are beholden to both GDPR and CCPA. reply tacticalturtle 15 hours agorootparentWhich products are available in Europe?The only other major service I can see is Pandora - which also does not have a presence in Europe. reply pierat 13 hours agoprev [–] I had a private conversation about customer service, rudeness, and such.It&#x27;s terrible that in order to do something as simple as \"I want to cancel this service\", you have to scream and make legal threats of retribution.These are policies put in by terrible and shit capitalists to \"make friction\" of people leaving.

Breached? Report an incident Home Blog SMTP Smuggling - Spoofing E-Mails Worldwide SMTP Smuggling - Spoofing E-Mails Worldwide 18.12.2023 Introducing a novel technique for e-mail spoofing In the course of a research project in collaboration with the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, Timo Longin (@timolongin) - known for his DNS protocol attacks - discovered a novel exploitation technique for yet another Internet protocol - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Threat actors could abuse vulnerable SMTP servers worldwide to send malicious e-mails from arbitrary e-mail addresses, allowing targeted phishing attacks. Due to the nature of the exploit itself, this type of vulnerability was dubbed SMTP smuggling. Multiple 0-days were discovered, and various vendors were notified during our responsible disclosure in 2023. Novel attacks in SMTP? Yes, you read that right - SMTP! Even though SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is used for sending e-mails across the globe since the beginning of the Internet, it is still possible to find new ways of exploiting it even in 2023! So, fasten your seat belts, as we embark on an expedition beyond the known limits of SMTP, and venture into the uncharted territories of SMTP smuggling! TL;DR By exploiting interpretation differences of the SMTP protocol, it is possible to smuggle/send spoofed e-mails - hence SMTP smuggling - while still passing SPF alignment checks. During this research, two types of SMTP smuggling, outbound and inbound, were discovered. These allowed sending spoofed e-mails from millions of domains (e.g., admin@outlook.com) to millions of receiving SMTP servers (e.g., Amazon, PayPal, eBay). Identified vulnerabilities in Microsoft and GMX were quickly fixed, however, SEC Consult urges companies using the also affected Cisco Secure Email product to manually update their vulnerable default configuration (see Responsible Disclosure section below)! Figure 1: Example SMTP session between sender.example and receiver.example SMTP Basics Before getting into the juicy bits and details of SMTP smuggling, we must first have a basic understanding of the SMTP protocol, SMTP terminology and e-mailing in general. Let's learn by example! Here, in figure 1, we have an SMTP session between sender.example and receiver.example. Figure 2: SMTP session transferring a mail object, including mail envelope and mail content/data, with SMTP commands, line breaks and data separated by color. So, what's exactly going on here? Initially, the receiving SMTP server mx.receiver.example sends a greeting, indicating that it is ready to accept incoming SMTP commands. The \"client\"/sender sender.example initiates the SMTP session by sending the EHLO (extended hello) SMTP command to the server, specifying its domain name. Note that all SMTP commands will be highlighted in red. mx.receiver.example responds with a 250 status code, indicating that the requested command (EHLO) was successful. It also provides supported SMTP capabilities. Then, sender.example specifies the sender e-mail address as well as the receiver e-mail address via \"mail FROM\" and \"rcpt TO\" in the mail envelope. mx.receiver.example confirms both of these SMTP commands with a 250 status code. Now, sender.example transmits the \"data\" command to signal its intention to start sending the message data/content. After receiving a \"go ahead\" response, sender.example sends messageheaders \"Subject\"/\"From\"/\"To\", a message body \"lorem ipsum\" and an end-of-data sequence\".\" (Carriage-Return / Line-Feed, and a single dot in a line). Note that all message data will be highlighted in blue. mx.receiver.example reads the end-of-data sequence and responds with a 250 status code, implying that the message data was accepted. Lastly, sender.example closes the connection via the \"quit\" command. As you can see, there is a lot of back and forth in this SMTP session. To keep it simple and concise, SMTP sessions in this blog post only include the data transmitted by the sender as shown in figure 2. Figure 3: Overview of a simplified e-mailing process via SMTP from left to right With this much knowledge about the SMTP protocol, we can put the training wheels aside and look at how SMTP is used to transfer e-mails across the Internet. For example, by sending an e-mail from user(at)outlook.com to user(at)receiver.example! When sending an e-mail via outlook.com, we generally have two options: Outlook's web interface Using SMTP Since this blog post is about SMTP smuggling and doesn't have to do anything with web applications (like SMTP header injection), we're opting for number two - SMTP! How this works is described in figure 3. So, starting from the left side of the overview, the mail user agent (MUA: Thunderbird, Outlook, Windows Mail, etc.) connects to Outlook's mail transfer agent (MTA) on the message submission port TCP/587. MTAs that are dedicated to sending outbound e-mails are further addressed as outbound SMTP servers. The MUA then sends a series of SMTP commands and message data. Since we haven't described the STARTTLS and AUTH LOGIN commands before, here is a short description: STARTTLS is used to upgrade to an encrypted TLS session. Since SMTP is generally unencrypted, credentials would otherwise be exposed to listening attackers. The AUTH LOGIN SMTP command is used for authenticating the user. In this case, this is done via username and password. After evaluating if the authenticated user is allowed to send an e-mail for the provided e-mail address in the \"mail FROM\" and \"From\" fields, the Outlook SMTP server sends an inbound e-mail to the inbound SMTP server of receiver.example over port TCP/25. This SMTP data looks very similar to the SMTP data submitted to the outbound SMTP server, but doesn't include the AUTH LOGIN command and, in this case, doesn't use STARTTLS. This concludes the e-mail transfer. But how does the receiving inbound SMTP server make sure that the outbound SMTP server is indeed allowed to send e-mails for outlook.com? Or, why can't just anyone send e-mails for the outlook.com domain? SPF, DKIM and DMARC Before an inbound SMTP server accepts an e-mail, it checks the sender's authenticity via e-mail authentication mechanisms such as SPF, DKIM and DMARC. This is important, since otherwise attackers could just send e-mails from arbitrary domains. For example, sending an e-mail as admin(at)outlook.com from an attacker server would be entirely possible. The most prevalent e-mail authentication mechanism, SPF, works by permitting sender IP addresses in special SPF/TXT DNS records. The SPF record of outlook.com permits the following IP ranges for e-mail transfer: v=spf1 include:spf-a.outlook.com include:spf-b.outlook.com ip4:157.55.9.128/25 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:spf-a.hotmail.com include:_spf-ssg-b.microsoft.com include:_spf-ssg-c.microsoft.com ~all Figure 4: Passing SPF checks with attacker.example domain, while sending as user@sender.example If you are not sending from one of these IP ranges, the SPF check would fail and your e-mail most likely won't be forwarded or will be marked as spam. But which domain is actually getting checked? The problem with SPF by itself is that only the MAIL FROM domain from the mail envelope is checked. The From header in the message data, which is further displayed in the received e-mail, can have an arbitrary value, as shown in figure 4 (blue text). Figure 5: Passing SPF and DKIM checks, by sending from an attacker server with an attacker-controlled DKIM key The same goes for DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) as well. DKIM allows signing the message data, including the From header. This signature can then be verified by the receiver with a public key that resides in the DNS. However, it is not enforced, which domain holds the public key (see figure 5). In this case, the message from \"user@sender.example\" may be signed, but the verification key is located at \"dkim._domainkey.attacker.example\". This location is derived from concatenating the selector (s=) \"dkim\", the static value \"_domainkey\" and the domain (d=) \"attacker.example\". So, even though an e-mail may have a valid SPF record and a valid DKIM signature, there is no mechanism for telling if the e-mail comes from a malicious sender or not. Fortunately, there is DMARC, which stands for \"Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance\". DMARC introduces so-called \"identifier alignment\" for SPF and DKIM and allows senders to specify alignment policies for both methods. It verifies if the email's \"From\" domain aligns with SPF checks and/or DKIM signatures. Thus, the DMARC check fails if there is a mismatch between the MAIL FROM and the From domain where otherwise the SPF check would pass. An example for a DMARC policy, which is always located in a TXT record at _dmarc.[domain], can be seen here: v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=none; fo=0; adkim=r; aspf=r; pct=100; rf=afrf The policy (p=) tells the receiving server to reject 100 percent (pct=) of the messages that fail the DMARC check. Therefore, the message will get accepted (only) if a valid SPF record and/or DKIM signature is provided. However, what happens if there is no DMARC record? In general, e-mail authenticity handling heavily depends on the inbound SMTP server's configuration and software. As a rule of thumb, if there is SPF or DKIM alignment, there is a good chance of the e-mail being accepted! Now, with the groundwork done, let's get into SMTP smuggling! Figure 6: Simple example of HTTP request smuggling by PortSwigger SMTP Smuggling? The initial goal of this research was to test the SMTP protocol against some common and exotic attacks that work on other protocols, such as HTTP. Thanks to the contribution of many brilliant minds, there is a variety of HTTP attacks to choose from. However, in the context of SMTP, one of them just fit the bill. HTTP request smuggling! If you want an in-depth explanation of HTTP request smuggling and all its facets, James Kettle (aka @albinowax) did a wonderful job on that. However, for now, we only need to understand the essentials! With HTTP request smuggling, we're basically trying to exploit different interpretations of the same thing. For example, with discrepancies in the interpretation and processing of the \"Content-Length\" and \"Transfer-Encoding\" HTTP headers, an arbitrary HTTP request can be smuggled to an otherwise unreachable back-end server like in figure 6. Figure 7: SMTP session with SMTP commands and message data separated by colour. In this example, the vulnerable front-end server only sees one HTTP POST request, while the back-end server sees a POST request and a GET request to /admin! With SMTP, we also have a setup with two servers, being outbound and inbound SMTP servers. So, let's take a look at an SMTP session again in figure 7. Figure 8: SMTP smuggling in theory Now tell me, what happens if outbound and inbound SMTP servers interpret the end-of-data sequence (.) differently? Exactly, SMTP smuggling! If SMTP servers have a different understanding of where the message data ends, an attacker can potentially break out of the message data. Even worse, this may allow to specify arbitrary SMTP commands and even to send separate e-mails (see figure 8)! Figure 9: SMTP analysis setup for analyzing outbound SMTP servers So, that's the basic idea of SMTP smuggling! But does it actually work? . is a lie? To get a good understanding of how different kinds of SMTP software work, we can start our analysis as shown in figure 9: Figure 10: Using . as end-of-data sequence #1 First, we register e-mail accounts at various public e-mail providers that support mail submissions via SMTP (unlike Tutanota and ProtonMail). We used the following providers for this research project: outlook.com gmail.com gmx.net icloud.com zoho.com fastmail.com runbox.com startmail.com mailbox.org aol.com yahoo.com web.de Then, by sending e-mails through the outbound SMTP servers of these providers and receiving them on an inbound SMTP analysis server, we can see first differences in the implementation of the SMTP protocol in these SMTP servers. When looking at the SMTP analysis client it becomes apparent straight away that some SMTP products do things \"differently\" than others. For example, here are some responses received from e-mail providers after sending the DATA SMTP command: - 250 End data with . - 250 Start mail input; end with . - 250 Send data ending with . This doesn't look good for our plans to smuggle SMTP commands, since we're looking for different interpretations of SMTP, and not the same text written differently. Right? But, we're not going to back off just because of some text, are we? After further analysis, some SMTP servers returned the following responses, which looked a bit more promising: - Enter message, ending with \".\" on a line by itself - Enter mail, end with \".\" on a line by itself Why would that be more promising, though? Well, different operating systems have a different understanding of \"a line by itself\". A \".\" on a line by itself on Windows would be separated via two carriage return line feeds (. or \\r.\\r), while a \".\" on a line by itself on Linux would be separated with two line feeds (. or .). So, why don't we try to end the message data of an e-mail with .? This would therefore look like in figure 10. Figure 11: Using . as end-of-data sequence #2 Now, if an SMTP server doesn't consider . as the end-of-data sequence, the connection will be left hanging, since it's waiting for the actual .. Therefore, as shown in figure 11, we add the following. Figure 12: Outbound e-mail provider delivering an e-mail with . sequence (not vulnerable) With this, whenever . is supported as end-of-data sequence by the inbound SMTP server, only \"lorem ipsum\" will be part of the message data, otherwise the message also includes \"This server is ignoring line feeds as end-of-data sequence!\". But, what can we actually achieve with this? Well, let's see how a message transfer could look like if . doesn't end the data section, like in figure 12. Figure 13: Outbound e-mail provider delivering an e-mail with . sequence (vulnerable) Depending on the receiving inbound SMTP server this may be completely harmless. However, what if the inbound SMTP server interprets . as end-of-data sequence? (see figure 13) Figure 14: Potential end-of-data sequence between START and END going through GMX's outbound SMTP server unchanged In this case, the \"harmless\" . breaks out of the message data and \"This server is ignoring line feeds as end-of-data sequence!\" may now be interpreted as an SMTP command! Note that this requires the inbound server to accept multiple SMTP commands in a batch, or so-called SMTP pipelining. Luckily for us, most servers support this nowadays. However, outbound SMTP servers commonly handle such \"troublesome\" . sequences via different means: Dot-stuffing (Escaping the single dot with another dot): .. Replacing it with aEncoding it (e.g., via quoted-printable): =0A.=0A Removing the entire sequence Not sending the message But sometimes, they do nothing at all! So, essentially, we're looking for specific characteristics in outbound and inbound SMTP servers in terms of end-of-data sequence handling. More precisely, we're searching for what outbound SMTP servers ignore (e.g., .) and what inbound SMTP servers interpret (e.g., . as end-of-data). If we can find a correct combination, we can smuggle! First Blood As previously mentioned, we've created e-mail accounts at various e-mail providers. Shortly after sending potential end-of-data sequences (e.g., .) from outbound provider SMTP servers to the SMTP analysis server, a promising candidate emerged! GMX, established in 1997, is one of the old-school e-mail providers in the DACH region with roughly 20 million users. When sending an . sequence to the outbound GMX SMTP server, it is passed unfiltered to the inbound SMTP server, as shown in figure 14! Figure 15: SMTP smuggling from admin@gmx.net to user@provider.example Therefore, we can now break out of the message data at the inbound SMTP server, if . is interpreted as an end-of-data sequence. So, how do we find such servers? We simply send an e-mail with the following message data (see figure 15) to all the e-mail addresses we've registered. Figure 16: Failed attempt of SMTP smuggling against Gmail For a lot of them, we receive a very suspicious looking e-mail like in figure 16, since . did not end the message data. Figure 17: Successful SMTP smuggling from GMX to Fastmail. \"Look at me! I am the admin now!\" But for some of them, we hit the jackpot! Figure 18: Cross-domain SMTP smuggling to different recipients This proof of concept (figure 17) was the first sign that SMTP smuggling actually works! By inspecting the message headers, we can see that the SPF check passes with domain alignment for gmx.net! This is because the smuggled message actually came from the legitimate GMX SMTP server. Received-SPF: pass (gmx.net: 212.227.15.15 is authorized to use 'admin@gmx.net' in 'mfrom' identity (mechanism 'ip4:212.227.15.0/25' matched)) receiver=mx4.messagingengine.com; identity=mailfrom; envelope-from=\"admin@gmx.net\"; helo=mout.gmx.net; client-ip=212.227.15.15 Since we've achieved domain alignment for gmx.net, this e-mail will most likely pass spam filters, even with strict DMARC policies! But wait, if other domains also use the outbound SMTP server of GMX to send e-mails, can't we spoof them as well? Let's see! By analyzing the SPF record of web.de, we can see that the outbound SMTP IP address of GMX 212.227.15.15 is included as well! v=spf1 ip4:212.227.126.128/25 ip4:212.227.15.0/25 ip4:212.227.17.0/27 ip4:217.72.192.248/29 ip4:82.165.159.0/26 ip4:217.72.207.0/27 ip4:217.72.192.64/26 ip4:82.165.229.130 ip4:82.165.230.22 ~all Now, we can change the SMTP smuggling message data accordingly, like in figure 18. Figure 19: Successful cross-domain SMTP smuggling from GMX to Fastmail using web.de as sender domain To simulate a real-life scenario, we specify a different receiver e-mail address for the first message and only send the smuggled message (figure 19) to the target. Figure 20: Censored (real) profile picture associated with admin@web.de In this case, our target would even see the associated profile picture (in this case of the real 'admin@web.de' user), like in figure 20! Figure 21: Sending message data via BDAT And again, the SPF verification checks out! Received-SPF: pass (web.de: 212.227.17.22 is authorized to use 'admin@web.de' in 'mfrom' identity (mechanism 'ip4:212.227.17.0/27' matched)) receiver=mx4.messagingengine.com; identity=mailfrom; envelope-from=\"admin@web.de\"; helo=mout.gmx.net; client-ip=212.227.17.22 Now, you might think that this was already cool, but we're just getting started! Even though we initially only analyzed GMX, the problem is far worse than it seemed at first. Like many big e-mail providers, GMX is using a custom SMTP server called NemesisSMTPd. Since GMX is part of Ionos, e-mailing services provided by Ionos are also using Nemesis SMTPd. By putting 1 and 1 together, we register an e-mail domain at Ionos and check if SMTP smuggling works. And it does! However, smuggling via a custom e-mail domain doesn't even seem to be necessary. The SPF record for the registered e-mail domain includes \"_spf-eu.ionos.com\" and the SPF record for gmx.net includes \"_spf.gmx.net\". Looking at the permitted IP ranges reveals \"some\" collisions: $ dig _spf-eu.ionos.com TXT \"v=spf1 ip4:212.227.126.128/25 ip4:212.227.15.0/25 ip4:212.227.17.0/27 ip4:82.165.159.0/26 ip4:217.72.192.64/26 ?all\" $ dig _spf.gmx.net TXT \"v=spf1 ip4:212.227.126.128/25 ip4:212.227.15.0/25 ip4:212.227.17.0/27 ip4:82.165.159.0/24 ip4:74.208.4.192/26 ip4:217.72.207.0/27 ip4:82.165.229.31 ip4:82.165.230.21 ip4:213.165.64.0/23 ip4:74.208.5.64/26 ~all\" So, either way, this allowed spoofing not only gmx.net and web.de, but also around a million other domains hosted at Ionos! But more on the details later! Smuggling via Microsoft Exchange Online After a deeper analysis of outbound SMTP servers, a peculiarity in Microsoft Outlook's (outlook.com) SMTP server was observed. When trying to send an . sequence, the message does not get transmitted, and the following error message is returned: Remote server returned '550 5.6.11 SMTPSEND.BareLinefeedsAreIllegal; message contains bare linefeeds, which cannot be sent via DATA and receiving system does not support BDAT' However, same as with GMX, Outlook doesn't filter . sequences. Still, it wasn't possible to smuggle to the same receivers (e.g., Fastmail) as with GMX. Reason for this is Outlook's usage of the optional BDAT SMTP command. BDAT is an alternative to the DATA command to transfer the message data. It works by specifying the message length with the BDAT command, instead of relying on an end-of-data sequence. For example, to transfer 72 bytes of message data, we can do it like in figure 21. Figure 22: Sending a phishing e-mail from admin@outlook.com via SMTP smuggling Even though that stops us from smuggling to some inbound SMTP servers, the BDAT command can only be used by Outlook, if the inbound SMTP server supports it. If the inbound SMTP server doesn't indicate BDAT support by returning the CHUNKING capability, DATA is used as fallback. Therefore, we're looking for an inbound SMTP server that interprets . as an end-of-data sequence and doesn't support BDAT. Funnily enough, the sec-consult.com SMTP server supports just that! Note that LOTS of servers on the Internet support this, but since we've got to make sure that our own systems are secure anyways, we'll be using sec-consult.com. So, what's the first thing to do with our newly gained power? Sending spoofed e-mails to co-workers to make sure it actually works! (see figure 22) Figure 23: Typical Austrian reaction after receiving a spoofed e-mail Based on their reaction (figure 23), the message from admin(at)outlook.com definitely got delivered and didn't end up in spam. Figure 24: Receiving a spoofed e-mail from admin@outlook.com aka Timo Lo(n)gin The actual e-mail is shown in figure 24: Figure 25: Using HTML with SMTP smuggling to create a convincing phishing e-mail We can once more confirm SPF alignment by looking at the message headers: Received-SPF: Pass (mx3.atos.net: domain of admin(at)outlook.com designates 40.92.75.68 as permitted sender) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=40.92.75.68; receiver=mx3.atos.net; envelope-from=\"admin@outlook.com\"; x-sender=\"admin@outlook.com\"; x-conformance=spf_only; x-record-type=\"v=spf1\"; x-record-text=\"v=spf1 ip4:40.92.0.0/15 ip4:40.107.0.0/16 ip4:52.100.0.0/14 ip4:104.47.0.0/17 ip6:2a01:111:f400::/48 ip6:2a01:111:f403::/49 ip6:2a01:111:f403:8000::/50 ip6:2a01:111:f403:c000::/51 ip6:2a01:111:f403:f000::/52 -all\" Since the previous examples were only text-based, attackers could also use HTML, for some more convincing phishing e-mails (figure 25). Figure 26: Receiving a spoofed e-mail on hr@sec-consult.com from ceo@sec-consult.com However, to keep it simple, we'll stick to just text. So, this is cool, but again, that's not everything! Since the outbound Outlook SMTP server is not only used for e-mails by outlook.com, but for the entirety of Exchange Online, we can now send e-mails from every domain which uses Exchange Online to send e-mails! Since this affects LOTS of companies (as later discussed in SMTP Smuggling Impact section), we can choose our sender domain freely. We can even use sec-consult.com itself! (see figure 26) Figure 27: Example message data with exotic end-of-data sequence using a null byte As before, the SPF check succeeds with domain alignment, since sec-consult.com is using Exchange Online and the SPF record includes the respective Exchange Online SPF domain spf.protection.outlook.com. Received-SPF: Pass (mx4.atos.net: domain of ceo(at)sec-consult.com designates 40.92.48.103 as permitted sender) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=40.92.48.103; receiver=mx4.atos.net; envelope-from=\"ceo@sec-consult.com\"; x-sender=\"ceo@sec-consult.com\"; x-conformance=spf_only; x-record-type=\"v=spf1\"; x-record-text=\"v=spf1 ip4:40.92.0.0/15 ip4:40.107.0.0/16 ip4:52.100.0.0/14 ip4:104.47.0.0/17 ip6:2a01:111:f400::/48 ip6:2a01:111:f403::/49 ip6:2a01:111:f403:8000::/50 ip6:2a01:111:f403:c000::/51 ip6:2a01:111:f403:f000::/52 -all\" With GMX and Exchange Online out of the way, we're now approaching our last target! Smuggling to Amazon, PayPal, eBay, ..., on the road to Cisco GMX and Exchange Online allow SMTP smuggling due to insufficient sanitization at their outbound SMTP servers, but what about insecure inbound SMTP servers? What if there are inbound SMTP servers that allow such non-restrictive end-of-data sequences that even the most restrictive outbound SMTP servers would let such sequences through? To get to the bottom of this, we can use a scanner that sends e-mails to inbound SMTP servers, but uses exotic end-of-data sequences. If the connection to the inbound SMTP server times out, the exotic end-of-data sequence was ignored. Otherwise, we most likely found something interesting! So, what exactly is \"exotic\"? Exotic end-of-data sequences could for example be: Interrupted end-of-data sequences: \\x00. .\\x00 End-of-data sequences using incomplete CRLFs: . . . End-of-data sequences in the message header The message data of such an \"exotic\" e-mail could look like in figure 27. Figure 28: SMTP smuggling exploiting exotic end-of-data sequence . Now, by scanning the former Alexa Top 1000, various inbound SMTP servers accepting such sequences were identified! However, only one of those sequences seems to be working for lots of SMTP servers: . This sequence gets accepted by the inbound e-mail servers of some really high-value targets: Amazon PayPal eBay Cisco The IRS The one thing that they all have in common is that they're using Cisco Secure Email, with on-prem Cisco Secure Email Gateway or cloud-based Cisco's Secure Email Cloud Gateway. And again, for some odd reason, sec-consult.com is using Cisco Secure Email Gateway as well! As a proof of concept (figure 28), we can now send an e-mail from admin(at)icloud.com to our target at sec-consult.com, since, like with many other outbound SMTP servers (further discussed in SMTP Smuggling Impact), . doesn't get filtered: Figure 29: Sending spoofed e-mails as admin@icloud.com Like before, the e-mail goes through unscathed, as shown in figure 29. Figure 30: Getting domains using Ionos e-mail services via SecurityTrails SPF checks pass with domain alignment and without any issues. Received-SPF: Pass (mx4.atos.net: domain of admin(at)icloud.com designates 17.57.155.23 as permitted sender) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=17.57.155.23; receiver=mx4.atos.net; envelope-from=\"admin@icloud.com\"; x-sender=\"admin@icloud.com\"; x-conformance=spf_only; x-record-type=\"v=spf1\"; x-record-text=\"v=spf1 ip4:17.58.0.0/16 ip4:17.57.155.0/24 ip4:17.57.156.0/24 ip4:144.178.36.0/24 ip4:144.178.38.0/24 ip4:112.19.199.64/29 ip4:112.19.242.64/29 ip4:222.73.195.64/29 ip4:157.255.1.64/29 ip4:106.39.212.64/29 ip4:123.126.78.64/29 ip4:183.240.219.64/29 ip4:39.156.163.64/29 ~all\" Hence, DMARC passes as well: Authentication-Results-Original: mx4.atos.net; dkim=none (message not signed) header.i=none; spf=Pass smtp.mailfrom=admin@icloud.com; spf=None smtp.helo=postmaster@qs51p00im-qukt01080502.me.com; dmarc=pass (p=quarantine dis=none) d=icloud.com With Cisco's Secure Email covered, we can now go on and take a look at the global impact! SMTP Smuggling Impact At this point we've covered lots of outbound and inbound SMTP smuggling. But, speaking globally, how bad is it? GMX and Ionos SMTP smuggling via GMX and Ionos e-mail services allowed SMTP smuggling from roughly 1.35 million different domains, as indicated by the domains pointing their MX record to Ionos (figure 30). Figure 31: Used SMTP software on the Internet (Shodan)(results may vary) Checking the SPF record of these domains confirms that they are most likely all permitting _spf-eu.ionos.com for sending e-mails. However, as already mentioned, SMTP smuggling doesn't work for every receiving inbound SMTP server and, in this case, requires inbound SMTP servers to accept . as end-of-data sequence. So, who's affected? Only few of the bigger e-mail providers that were tested are affected. These include: Fastmail Runbox This might not seem bad at first, but looking at affected SMTP software on the Internet is a different story. After testing some popular e-mail software in their default configuration, it turned out that Postfix and Sendmail fulfil the requirements, are affected and can be smuggled to. Speaking globally, this is a lot (figure 31)! Aside from Postfix and Sendmail, other SMTP implementations are most likely affected as well, including Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway, to which we'll get in a second. Microsoft Exchange Online Same as GMX and Ionos, Exchange Online allowed smuggling via a . end-of-data sequence as well, which makes it possible to smuggle from every domain pointing their SPF record to Exchange Online. This amounts to millions of domains all across the globe, including some very high-value targets owned by Microsoft like microsoft.com, msn.com, github.com, outlook.com, office365.com, openai.com and many more, and also domains of their customers (e.g., tesla.com, mastercard.com, nike.com, etc.). However, as previously mentioned, smuggling from Exchange Online is even more restricted than from GMX/Ionos, since the receiving inbound SMTP server must support BDAT. This is the case for Fastmail and - still - hundreds of thousands of postfix and sendmail servers. Software Without BDAT/CHUNKING Total Percentage Shodan query Postfix 716884 1475616 ~50% postfix port:25 -CHUNKING Sendmail 168823 169030 ~99% sendmail port:25 -CHUNKING Figure 32: Relevant configuration settings of Cisco Secure Email These numbers from Shodan might not paint the whole picture though, as many servers maybe running postfix, but are hiding their identification banner. Also, other smaller SMTP servers are affected as well, again including Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway. We did not analyze all SMTP software out there, hence it might be possible that other vulnerable servers exist as well. Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway The Cisco Secure Email Gateway and its cloud counterpart, the Cisco Secure Email Cloud Gateway, are both \"vulnerable\" to inbound SMTP smuggling. The quotes are necessary in this case, since, according to lengthy discussions with Cisco, this is not a bug, but a feature (see Responsible Disclosure section)! By default, Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway accepts . as end-of-data sequence, which does not get filtered by the following SMTP servers when sending outbound: Outlook/Exchange Online Icloud On-premise exchange server Postfix Sendmail Startmail Fastmail Zohomail This would allow inbound SMTP smuggling to around 40k domains using Cisco's Secure Email Cloud Gateway, if they're using the default configuration (like we did). These domains can be determined by checking a passive DNS database like SecurityTrails for iphmx.com subdomains. Identifying on-premise Cisco Secure Email Gateways on the other hand is a difficult task, since lots of Internet-wide scanners (e.g., Shodan) seem to get blocked when conducting service scans. However, to get a better feeling for the usage of this product, we scanned the former Alexa Top 1000, and discovered at least the following 35 domains. amazon.com amazon.co.jp amazon.co.uk amazon.it amazon.fr marriott.com cisco.com amazon.co.jp amazon.in paypal.com amazon.ca goodreads.com webex.com custhelp.com amazon.in imdb.com intuit.com ndtv.com amazon.cn makemytrip.com amazon.com.au amazon.com amazonaws.com primevideo.com amazon.es irs.gov amazon.com.br aastocks.com ebay.com amazon.de ebay.de ebay.co.uk ebay.com.au mayoclinic.org audible.com Note that this doesn't take into account servers that don't have an MX record let alone an SMTP server. Further vulnerabilities During the research we've also discovered some exotic inbound SMTP servers that interpret end-of-data sequences like \\x00., with \"\\x00\" representing a null byte. With proprietary SMTP components and lots of different e-mail services intertwined it's hard to tell what is possible until an e-mail reaches its final destination. Even though SMTP smuggling might still be hiding in some places, we hopefully eliminated some big targets. Responsible Disclosure How do we report a vulnerability that is based on protocol interpretation? Who is right, who is wrong? Let's take a look at some RFCs! In general, RFC 5321 from 2008 states the following: \"The custom of accepting lines ending only in , as a concession to non-conforming behavior on the part of some UNIX systems, has proven to cause more interoperability problems than it solves, and SMTP server systems MUST NOT do this, even in the name of improved robustness. In particular, the sequence \".\" (bare line feeds, without carriage returns) MUST NOT be treated as equivalent to . as the end of mail data indication.\" So, it's the inbound SMTP server's fault! But wait, RFC 5322, also from 2008, says the following about the body of a message: \"CR and LF MUST only occur together as CRLF; they MUST NOT appear independently in the body.\" This essentially means that both sides (outbound and inbound) are at fault! Also, this shows us that inconsistent interpretation of the end-of-data sequence is not a novel issue. Now, what do the affected parties think about this? We have thus initiated our responsible disclosure process around end of July 2023 (see Timeline further below). GMX The responsible disclosure process with GMX was pure bliss. After immediately receiving a response, the issue was fixed in roughly ten days. Aside from paying a bounty, they even added Timo to their bug bounty hall of fame. All-in-all a great experience! Huge props to GMX for such a professional and quick reaction. Microsoft The outbound SMTP smuggling vulnerability was submitted via the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). Roughly a month later, Microsoft replied: \"Thank you again for submitting this issue to Microsoft. Currently, MSRC prioritizes vulnerabilities that are assessed as “Important” or “Critical'’ severities for immediate servicing. After careful investigation, this case has been assessed as moderate severity and does not meet MSRC’s bar for immediate servicing since the attack only works if the mail server of the recipient treats a non-standard EOD sequence as EOD . However, we have shared the report with the team responsible for maintaining the product or service. They will take appropriate action as needed to help keep customers protected\" Fair enough, they got bigger fish to fry! After retesting the issue every now and then, they seem to have fixed it roughly in the middle of October 2023. Cisco As previously mentioned, the \"vulnerability\" in Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway is not a bug, but a feature. And, unlike in most cases, this is actually somewhat true. Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway can be configured to handle carriage returns and line feeds in a special manner, as seen here. However, by default, Cisco Secure Email (Cloud) Gateway \"Allows the message, but converts bare CR and LF characters to CRLF characters\" (the vulnerable \"Clean\" setting), which basically enables inbound SMTP smuggling via . end-of-data sequences. We have communicated this issue to Cisco and CERT/CC and went back and forth quite a bit. But at the end of the day, it's not a bug, it's a feature. Since this feature allowed us to send spoofed e-mails from arbitrary Exchange Online domains straight into our inboxes, we decided to change the configuration to \"Allow\". This passes e-mails with bare carriage returns or line feeds on to our actual e-mail server (Cisco Secure Email Gateway is just a gateway), which only interprets . as end-of-data sequence. If you don't want to receive spoofed e-mails with valid DMARC checks as well, we highly recommend changing your configuration! Conclusion We've shown a novel SMTP spoofing technique with this research that allowed to spoof e-mails from millions of domains. Even though Microsoft and GMX have patched this issue promptly, inbound SMTP smuggling to Cisco Secure Email instances (cloud and on-premise) is still possible with default configurations. We highly encourage to change these default configurations, as described in the Responsible Disclosure chapter. Also, this blog post hopefully sparked further interest in SMTP research, since there is still so much to explore. Even with SMTP smuggling alone, there are many things to look at: Other smuggling techniques Bounce smuggling Smuggling via BDAT Smuggling dangerous/exotic SMTP commands Internet-wide scans Other SMTP software etc. So, this is probably not the last time you've heard of SMTP smuggling!

FAQ How do I know if I am affected? If you are a user of a big e-mail provider (Outlook, Gmail, etc.), you are most likely going to be fine (for now at least). Since SMTP smuggling is a fairly new topic and still has things to explore, we cannot be certain though. However, if you're using Cisco Secure Email (cloud or on-premise), you should definitely check your configuration (see Responsible Disclosure)! But, as always, don't blindly trust anything that lands in your e-mail inbox! Is there a tool available to verify whether I am vulnerable? We have developed an analysis tool internally but decided to publish it at a later date (maybe already at the 37C3 conference end of December 2023 where this research will be presented), as currently many Cisco Secure Mail installations are affected by the issue. Do smuggled e-mails always get past spam filters? The short answer is no, not always! Even though the smuggled e-mail might come from a legitimate sender and passes e-mail authentication due to SPF alignment, the e-mail might still get blocked, depending on the e-mail contents and other factors. Also, if more than SPF alignment is required for the e-mail to go through, we're out of luck with SMTP smuggling. How would someone even get the idea of looking at a protocol like SMTP? There are two major reasons: SMTP is a very old protocol that is somewhat flying under the radar of a lot of security researchers (kind of like DNS). Since there wasn't any related research that indicated similar attacks, the chances were good for finding something new! Phishing is one of the best ways for threat actors or our red teamers to gain initial access to an organization. Therefore, looking for vulnerabilities in the underlying e-mail protocol - SMTP - seemed natural. Is this a novel attack technique? Most likely! Again, for two major reasons: Microsoft's SMTP infrastructure including Exchange Online was vulnerable. This would have most likely been found and fixed by prior researchers. We haven't found any research stating otherwise. Are there other interesting SMTP and e-mailing attacks? Yes, lots of them! For example, \"Weak Links in Authentication Chains: A Large-scale - Analysis of Email Sender Spoofing Attacks\" shows a range of interesting attacks that even worked with Gmail! Can confusions ofandand alike cause security issues in other protocols as well? Yes, of course! In general, implementations of (sometimes) vague specifications can cause all kinds of security issues. Have you scanned the whole Internet and tested ALL e-mailing services? As already mentioned, scanning e-mail services for used software and versions may yield inaccurate results and will most likely get you on some kind of blacklist. The same goes for more specific end-of-data sequence checks, where basically a whole e-mail is sent. Therefore, we could roughly only analyze the top 10k of Alexa domains during this research.

The server accepting your email may interpret this as part of the body and forward it to a system which interprets it as the end of the body, with the rest being interpreted as more SMTP commands.This allows you to relay arbitrary commands via this SMTP server. An outbound relay may pass SPF (unlike your IP). A vulnerable inbound server may let you bypass certain checks (such as SPF, but perhaps also a malware filter) because the server you&#x27;re talking to is trusted by the internal receiving server.As an outbound example, Microsoft wouldn&#x27;t allow you to pretend to be admin@hotmail or admin@another_customer_of_hotmail&#x27;s when logging in with your regular user account and submitting an email, but this attack lets you send two emails appearing as one to their system, with only the first one being validated. reply iforgotpassword 18 minutes agoprevOk wow, anyone else thinks Cisco is being really stupid here? Their sanitizer might make sense for inbound smtp connections from authenticated mail clients, as any malicious or accidental \"weirdness\" would be turned into proper EOD sequences with no ambiguity for the actual SMTP server.But for inbound connections from other smtp servers this actually makes sure the exploit works 100%, the smtp server behind the gateway has zero chance to detect the attack since it now gets a proper EOD sequence with another mail after. Just wow that they couldn&#x27;t understand that this is a bad default. reply drdaeman 9 hours agoprevEdit: ah, right, the article says the same thing.This will still break DKIM (no signing for the fake second message, and even the first message&#x27;s signature is going to be corrupt?), so a restrictive DMARC policy (p=reject; adkim=s) should mitigate this even if the server software is vulnerable, right?And if someone tries to force a server to send email for an unauthorized source (e.g. make mail.example.org send a bogus mail for ycombinator.com) - well, this sucks in terms of potentially having to get the vulnerable host out of DNSBLs, but email is still not gonna get through (because of SPF) and I hope RBLs are gonna have a bit relaxed attitude towards this in the next few weeks?(I don&#x27;t seriously believe someone&#x27;s not checking SPF, DKIM or DMARC those days - they&#x27;re basically three cornerstones of modern mail server auth) reply kevincox 8 hours agoparent> so a restrictive DMARC policy (p=reject; adkim=s)This isn&#x27;t how DMARC works. Valid SPF OR DKIM will validate a message. So unless you drop your SPF policy DMARC will still pass. And unfortunately if you don&#x27;t have a good SPF policy many mail servers will send your messages to the spam folder, so there isn&#x27;t a good way to have only DKIM set up.There are some discussions about requiring DKIM independent of SPF, but nothing published (nevermind adopted) yet. reply taskforcegemini 41 minutes agorootparentis it then better to not use dmarc at all? because then mailservers usually verify both if either exist reply drdaeman 5 hours agorootparentprevOops!
