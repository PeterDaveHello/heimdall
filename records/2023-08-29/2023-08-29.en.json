In many of these organizations, employees are already pasting a lot of sensitive data into ChatGPT unless access to ChatGPT itself is restricted. We know a few companies that ended up deploying chatbot-ui with Azure&#x27;s OpenAI offering since Azure claims to not use user&#x27;s data (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;legal&#x2F;cognitive-services&#x2F;o...).We ended up adding support for Azure&#x27;s OpenAI offering to our platform as well as open-source our engine to support on-prem deployments (LLMStack - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trypromptly&#x2F;LLMStack) to deal with the privacy concerns these enterprises have. reply irrational 8 hours agoparentMy company (Fortune 500 with 80,000 full time employees) has a policy that forbids the use of any AI or LLM tool. The big concern listed in the policy is that we may inadvertently use someone else’s IP from training data. So, our data going into the tool is one concern, but the other is our using something we are not authorized to use because the tool has it already in its data. How do you prove that that could never occur? The only way I can think of is to provide a comprehensive list of everything the tool was trained on. reply fxnn 1 hour agorootparentFor me that discussion is always hard to grasp. When a human would learn coding autodidacticly by reading source code, and later they would write new code — then they could only do so because they read licensed code. No one would ask for the license, right?So why do we care from where LLMs learn? reply sensanaty 1 hour agorootparent> So why do we care from where LLMs learn?Because humans aren&#x27;t computers and the similarities between the two, other than the overuse of the word \"learning\" in the computer&#x27;s case, are nonexistant? reply DrScientist 24 minutes agorootparentprevThere is the element of the unknown with LLMs etc.There is a legal difference between learning from something and truly making your own version and simply copying.It&#x27;s vague of course - take plagiarism in a university science essay - the student has no original data and very likely no original thought - but still there is a difference between simply copying a textbook and writing it in your own words.Bottom line - how do we know the output of the LLM isn&#x27;t a verbatim copy of something with the license stripped off? reply peoplefromibiza 1 hour agorootparentprev> So why do we care from where LLMs learn?same difference there is between painting your own fake Caravaggio and buying a fake Caravaggio (or selling the one you made).the second one is forgery, the first one is not. reply joncrocks 20 minutes agorootparentAnd if you look at lots of paintings, and create a new painting which is in a very similar style to an existing painting?Is that a forgery? Have you infringed on the copyright on all the paintings you looked at? reply blackhaz 1 hour agorootparentprevThe way I see it is that with AI you have really painted your own Caravaggio, but instead of an electrochemical circuit of a human brain you&#x27;ve employed a virtual network. reply peoplefromibiza 1 hour agorootparent> but instead of an electrochemical circuit of a human brain you&#x27;ve employed a virtual network.technically it is still a tool you are using, differently from doing it on your own, with your hands, using your own brain cells, that you trained over the decades, instead of using a virtual electronic brain pre-trained in hours&#x2F;days by someone else on who knows what. reply tmpX7dMeXU 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a legal unknown. There’s nothing more to it. Your employer has opted for one side of the coin flip, and it’s the risk averse-one. Any reasonably-sized org is going to be raising the same questions, but instead opting to reap the benefits and take on the legal risk, which is something organisations do all the time anyway. reply happytiger 5 hours agorootparentThere is a very real concern about being “left behind” on these issues building.You’ve got to be early, but not so early you get legal or business disruptions or concequences.It’s quite the balancing act for exec teams. reply ajhai 6 hours agorootparentprev> The only way I can think of is to provide a comprehensive list of everything the tool was trained on.There are some startups working in the space that essentially plan to do something like this. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.konfer.ai&#x2F;aritificial-intelligence-trust-managem... is one I know of that is trying to solve this. They enable these foundation model providers to maintain an inventory of training sources so they can easily deal with coming regulations etc. reply fragmede 4 hours agorootparentprev> How do you prove that that could never occur?Realistically you can prove that just as well as you can prove that employees aren&#x27;t using ChatGPT via their cellphones.There are also organizations that forbid the use of Stack overflow. As long as employees don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re holding back their career and skills by prohibiting them from using modern tools, and keep working there, hey. As long as you pay them enough to stay, people will put up with a lot, even if it hurts them. reply kortilla 3 hours agorootparentUsing chatgpt to code is not a skill. It’s a crutch. Any employees that feel held back by not being able to access it aren’t great in the first place. reply cebert 3 minutes agorootparentI think it can be a productivity booster. At my company, I need to touch multiple projects in multiple languages. I can ask ChatGPT how to do something, such as enumerate an array, in a language I’m less familiar with so that I can more quickly contribute to a project. Using ChatGPT as a coach, I am also slowly learning new things. reply sinfulprogeny 3 hours agorootparentprevUsing $technological_aide \\in {chatgpt,ide,stackoverflow,google,debuggers,compilers,optimizers,high-mem VMs}$ to code is not a skill. It’s a crutch. Any employees that feel held back by not being able to access it aren’t great in the first place. reply noduerme 3 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think using ChatGPT is similar to searching for answers on S.O. Maybe if you were asking people on S.O. to write your code for you, or plugging in exact snippets. The point here is that letting ChatGPT write code directly into your repo is effectively plagiarism and may violate any number of licenses you don&#x27;t even realize you&#x27;re breaking, whereas just looking at how other people did something, understanding, and then writing your own code, does not. reply DougBTX 37 minutes agorootparentHonestly I couldn’t tell you whether copying code out of Stack Overflow or out of ChatGPT is more legally suspect. For SO, you don’t know where the user got the code from either (wrote it themselves? Copied it out of their work repo? Copied from some random GPL source?) reply hanselot 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been experiencing carpal tunnel on and off for a couple of weeks now. I can tell you that reading through some code generated by \"insert llm x\" is substantially less painful than writing all of it by my own hand.Especially if you start understanding how to refine your prompts to the point where you use a single thread for project management and use that thread to generate prompts for other threads.Not all value to be gained from this is purely copypasta. reply peoplefromibiza 1 hour agorootparentprev> It’s a crutchproblem is most of the code chatgpt spouts is wrong, in so many subtle ways, that sometimes you just have to run it to prove it.so basically you have to be better than chatgpt at that particular task to spot its mistakes.using it blindly it&#x27;s similar to the Gell-Mann amnesia effecthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;theportal.wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Gell-Mann_Amnesia_Effectsaid by someone who uses chatgpt extensively, it is good for the structure, to get an idea, but as a code generator it kinda sucks. reply stormfather 2 hours agorootparentprevAnyone who can&#x27;t figure out how to become more efficient with the aid of LLMs is a dinosaur. reply fhd2 37 minutes agorootparentI dunno about that. I honestly tried to extract _any_ value in my day to day work from LLMs, but aside from being an OK alternative to Google&#x2F;SO, I mostly did find it to be a crutch.I never had issues with quickly writing a draft or typing in code. I do realise that for a lot of people, starting on a green field is hard, but for me it&#x27;s easier.My going hypotheses is that people are just different, and some get true value out of it while others don&#x27;t. If it works for you, I&#x27;m not gonna call you names for it. reply fxnn 1 hour agorootparentprevSounds like the perspective of someone who never gave that tool a real chance. To me it’s primarily just another aid like IDE inspections, IDE autocompletions etc.I use GitHub Autopilot mainly for smaller chunks of code, another kind of autocompletion, which basically safes me from typing, Googling or looking into the docs, and therefore keeps me in the flow. reply spullara 2 hours agorootparentprevCan you share your linkedin? reply tomjen3 1 hour agorootparentprevHere is a bunch of JSON. Output the c# classes that can deserialise it.An intern in college could do that, but it isn’t worth our time to do.For this function, write the unit tests. Now you do not have anything that you can blindly commit, but you are at the stage where you are reviewing code.Could you do all of this by hand? Sure but you never would, you would use an IDE. Chatgpt is better than an IDE when you know how to use it. reply morelisp 3 hours agorootparentprevHorrible metaphor aside, at our company it&#x27;s not the software developers most overusing ChatGPT. reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d avoid the use of the word crutch, it sounds ableist as fuck; my girlfriend has a joint disease and relies on a crutch to walk. In other words, while I understand it&#x27;s just a figure of speech: how dare you.It&#x27;s a tool that can help, just like an IDE, code generators, code formatters, etc. No need to talk down on it in that fashion, and there&#x27;s no need to look down your nose at tools or the people that use it. reply mmmmmbop 2 hours agorootparentHow is it offensive to use crutch in this context? The implication being that it&#x27;s a tool that helps people do something they&#x27;d struggle with otherwise. I don&#x27;t see why anyone might be offended by that. reply concordDance 2 hours agorootparentprevYour girlfriend is less able to walk and thus uses a crutch to compensate, but it doesn&#x27;t let her walk as well as a normal person. Replace \"walk\" with \"code\" and the sentence works for ChatGPT if the grandparent is correct. reply spullara 2 hours agorootparentprevSomeone that doesn&#x27;t use the tools available to them would be like folks hammering in nails with their forehead. reply stavros 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy is the word \"crutch\" ableist, when the meaning is exactly analogous? It&#x27;s a tool to help you do something you can&#x27;t easily do yourself. reply wodenokoto 2 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t that a benefit of using a provider?Microsoft&#x2F;OpenAI are selling a service. They’re both reputable companies. If it turns out that they are reselling stolen data, are you really liable for purchasing it?If you buy something that fell of a truck, then you are liable for purchasing stolen goods. But if it turns out that all the bananas in wall mart were stolen from cosco you’re not as a customer liable for theft.Similarly, I don’t know if Clarkson Intelligence have purchased proper license for all the data they are reselling. Maybe they are also scraping some proprietary source and now you are using someone else’s IP. reply matkoniecz 14 minutes agorootparent> But if it turns out that all the bananas in wall mart were stolen from cosco you’re not as a customer liable for theft.Actually, that would be fencing stolen goods and customers could have obligations.Cases of bananas is a bit silly as returning bananas would be not possible and value is too small to bother.But imagine reputable car dealer selling stolen cars, repossession is far more likely here. reply arghwhat 2 hours agorootparentprevEven if you find a way to successfully forward liability and damages to Microsoft and OpenAI - which I doubt you will be able to as the damages are determined by your use of the IP - you do not gain the right to use the affected IP and will have a cease and desist for whatever is built upon it.How legitimate the IP concern is and whether it holds up in court is one thing, but finger pointing will probably not be sufficient. reply sgt101 1 hour agorootparentAlso I thing that MS &#x2F; OpenAI cannot and will not indemnify you. I think that their CEO and CFO have a duty not to... reply sirspacey 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s an interesting question.To effectively sue you, I believe the plaintiff would have to prove the LLM you were using was trained on that IP and it was not in the public domain. Neither seems very doable. reply DSMan195276 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t actually think either of those things are all that hard, certainly it&#x27;s a gray area until this actually happens but I think AI generation is not all that different from any other copyright situation. Even with regular copyright cases you don&#x27;t need to prove \"how\" the copying occurred to show copyright infringement, rather you just have to show that it&#x27;s the likely explanation (to the level of some standard). Point being, you potentially don&#x27;t need to prove anything about the AI training as long as you can show that the AI&#x27;s result is clearly identifiable as your work and is extremely unlikely to be generated any other way.Ex. CoPilot can insert whole blocks of code with comments and variable names from copyrighted code, if those aspects are sufficiently unique then it&#x27;s extremely unlikely to be produced any way other than coming from your code. If the code isn&#x27;t a perfect copy then it&#x27;s trickier, but that&#x27;s also the case if I copy your code and remove all the comments, so it&#x27;s still not all that different from the current status quo.The bigger question is who gets sued, but I can&#x27;t imagine any AI company actually making claims about the copyright status of the output of their AI, so it&#x27;s probably on you for using it. reply vGPU 7 hours agorootparentprevIt could open quite a wide window for patent trolls though, who generally go for settlements under the threat of a protracted court battle which is of minimal cost to them, as they are often single purpose law firms that do that and only that.Being able to have your legal counsel tell them to go bug openAI could potentially save you from quite a few anklebiters all seeking to get their own piece. reply Andrew018 5 hours agorootparentprevYour observation highlights the complexities of legal actions related to AI-generated content. Proving the exact source of a specific piece of content from a language model like the one I&#x27;m based on can indeed be challenging, especially when considering that training data is a mixture of publicly available information. Additionally, the evolving nature of AI technology and the lack of clear legal precedents in many jurisdictions further complicate the matter. However, legal interpretations may vary, and it&#x27;s advisable for any legal proceedings to involve legal experts well-versed in both AI technology and intellectual property law. Also, check out AC football cases. reply judge2020 6 hours agorootparentprev> but the other is our using something we are not authorized to use because the tool has it already in its data.We won&#x27;t know if this is legally sound until a company who isn&#x27;t forbidding A.I. usage gets sued and they claim this as a defense. For all we know the court could determine that, as long as the content isn&#x27;t directly regurgitated, it&#x27;s seen as fair use of the input data. reply hnfong 5 hours agorootparentprevJust curious, do they have bans on \"traditional\" online sources like Google search results, Wikipedia, and Stack Overflow?From my view, copying information from Google search results isn&#x27;t that much different from copying the response from ChatGPT.Notably Stack Overflow&#x27;s license is Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, which I believe very people actually realize when copying snippets from there. reply Semaphor 5 hours agorootparent> Notably Stack Overflow&#x27;s license is Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, which I believe very people actually realize when copying snippets from there.A lot of the snippets would not meet the standard for copyrightable code, though. At least that’s my understanding as non-lawyer. reply peanball 5 hours agorootparentprevWith SO you also have no guarantee that the person has the license to put that snippet. Even that could have been copied from somewhere else. A customer was scanning for and banning SO, if that was the only determined source. reply spullara 2 hours agorootparentprevThey are stupid and don&#x27;t understand risk vs reward. reply onethought 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not logical, because how can the company prove that could never happen from 80,000 employees writing things?i.e. Without ChatGPT an employee could still copy and paste something from somewhere. ChatGPT actually doesn&#x27;t change the equation at all. reply mveertu 11 hours agoparentprevSo, how do you plan to commercialize your product? I have noticed tons of chatbot cloud-based app providers built on top of ChatGPT API, Azure API (ask users to provide their API key). Enterprises will still be very wary of putting their data on these multi-tenant platforms. I feel that even if there is encryption that&#x27;s not going to be enough. This screams for virtual private LLM stacks for enterprises (the only way to fully isolate). reply ajhai 11 hours agorootparentWe have a cloud offering at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com. We do offer enterprises the ability to host their own vector database to maintain control of their data. We also support interacting with open source LLMs from the platform. Enterprises can bring up https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-skynet&#x2F;LocalAI, run Llama or others and connect to them from their Promptly LLM apps.We also provide support and some premium processors for enterprise on-prem deployments. reply rsiqueira 11 hours agorootparentBut, in order to generate the vectors, I understand that it&#x27;s necessary to use the OpenAI&#x27;s Embeddings API, which would grant OpenAI access to all client data at the time of vector creation. Is this understanding correct? Or is there a solution for creating high-quality (semantic) embeddings, similar to OpenAI&#x27;s, but in a private cloud&#x2F;on premises environment? reply ajhai 10 hours agorootparentEnterprises with Azure contracts are using embeddings endpoint from Azure&#x27;s OpenAI offering.It is possible to use llama or bert models to generate embeddings using LocalAI (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localai.io&#x2F;features&#x2F;embeddings&#x2F;). This is something we are hoping to enable in LLMStack soon. reply ivalm 10 hours agorootparentprevSentence-Bert is at least as good as OpenAI embeddings. But I think more importantly Azure OpenAI model api is already soc2 and hipaa compliant. reply mveertu 11 hours agorootparentprevEnterprises can bring up https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-skynet&#x2F;LocalAI, run Llama or others and connect to them from their Promptly LLM apps - So spin up GPU instances and host whatever model in their VPC and it connects to your SaaS stack? What are they paying you for in this scenario? reply amelius 11 hours agoparentprev> is going to put a lot of the enterprises at ease and embrace ChatGPT in their business processes.Except many companies deal with data of other companies, and these companies do not allow the sharing of data. reply osigurdson 3 hours agoparentprevAzures ridiculous agreement likely put a lot of orgs off. They also shouldn&#x27;t have tried to \"improve\" upon OpenAI&#x27;s APIs. OpenAI&#x27;s APIs are a little under thought (particularly fine tuning) but so what? reply rr808 10 hours agoparentprevAt the corp I work for Chat GPT (even bing) is blocked at the firewall. Hopefully now we&#x27;ll be able to use it. reply eoproc 4 hours agoparentprevWill be doing a show HN for https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proc.gg, a generative AI platform I&#x27;ve built during my sabbatical.I personally believe that in addition to OpenAI&#x27;s offering, the ability to swap to an open source model e.g. Llama-2 is the way to go for enterprise offerings in order to get full control. reply dools 11 hours agoparentprev> we quickly learned how sensitive enterprises are when it comes to sharing their data\"They&#x27;re huge pussies when it comes to security\" - Jan the Man[0][0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memes.getyarn.io&#x2F;yarn-clip&#x2F;b3fc68bb-5b53-456d-aec5-4... reply Gentil 3 hours agoprevThe ChatGPT model has violated pretty much all open source licenses (including MIT license which needs attribution. Show me one single OSS project&#x27;s license attribution before arguing please.) and is standing still. With the backing of microsoft, I am confused. What will happen if they violate their promise and train data selectively from competitors or potential small companies?What is actually stopping them? Most companies won&#x27;t have the fire power to go against microsoft backed openai. How can we ensure that they can&#x27;t violate this? How can they be practically held accountable?This as far as I am concerned is \"Trust me bro!\". How is it not otherwise? reply superfrank 3 hours agoparent> The ChatGPT model has violated pretty much all open source licensesAre you claiming this because they used copyrighted material as training data? If so, I think you&#x27;re starting from the wrong point.Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but last I heard using copyrighted data is pretty murky waters legally and they&#x27;re operating in a gray area. Additionally, I don&#x27;t think many open source licenses explicitly forbid using their code as training data. The issue isn&#x27;t just that most other companies don&#x27;t have the resources to go up against Microsoft&#x2F;OpenAI, it&#x27;s that even if they did, it isn&#x27;t clear whether the courts would find that Microsoft&#x2F;OpenAI did anything wrong.I&#x27;m not saying that I side with Microsoft&#x2F;OpenAI in this debate, but I just don&#x27;t think this is as clear cut as you&#x27;re making it seem. reply torginus 2 hours agorootparentUS copyright&#x2F;IP management is such a shitsh*w. On one hand you can get sued by patent trolls who own the patent for &#x27;button that turns things on&#x27; or get your video delisted for recording at a mall where some copyrighted music is playing in the background, on the other hand, you get people arguing that scraping code and websites with proprietary licences is &#x27;fair use&#x27; reply Gentil 2 hours agorootparentprev> Are you claiming this because they used copyrighted material as training data? If so, I think you&#x27;re starting from the wrong point.All open source license comes under copyright law. It means if they violate the OSS license, the license is void and the tech&#x2F;material becomes copyright protected. So yes, it would mean that it is trained on copyrighted material.> Additionally, I don&#x27;t think many open source licenses explicitly forbid using their code as training data.It doesn&#x27;t forbid. For example, permissive license like MIT can be used to train LLM&#x27;s if they are in compliance. The only requirement when you train on a MIT licensed codebase is that you need to provide attribution. It is one of the easiest license to comply. It means, you just need to copy paste the copyright notice.

If it is not, MIT license is void and you are violating the license. The end result is you are training on copyrighted material. I am more than happy to be corrected if you could find me any single OSS license attribution shown somewhere for training the openai model.Also, this can be still be fixed by adding the attribution for the code that is trained on. THIS IS MY ARGUMENT. The absolute ignorance and arrogance is their motivation and agenda.Which is why I am asking, WHAT IS STOPPING THEM FROM VIOLATING THEIR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CHATGPT ENTERPRISE? reply rhdunn 1 hour agorootparentprevTaking this from a different perspective, let&#x27;s say that ChatGPT, CodePilot, or similar service gets trained on Windows source code. Then a WINE developer uses ChatGPT or CodePilot to implement one of the methods. Is WINE then liable for including Windows proprietary source code in their codebase even if they have never seen that code.The same would apply to any other application.

Does this mean companies might be able to upload, say, PDFs, and fine-tune the model on that? reply mediaman 15 hours agorootparentPretty unlikely. Generally you don&#x27;t use fine-tuning for bare documents. You use retrieval augmented generation, which usually involves vector similarity search.Fine-tuning isn&#x27;t great at learning knowledge. It&#x27;s good at adopting tone or format. For example, a chirpy helper bot, or a bot that outputs specifically formatted JSON.I also doubt they&#x27;re going to have a great system for fine-tuning. Successful fine-tuning requires some thought into what the data looks like (bare docs won&#x27;t work), at which point you have technical people working on the project anyway.Their future connection system will probably be in the format of API prompts to request data from an enterprise system using their existing function fine-tuning feature. They tried this already with plugins, and they didn&#x27;t work very well. Maybe they&#x27;ll come up with a better system. Generally this works better if you write your own simple API for it to interface with which does a lot of the heavy lifting to interface with the actual enterprise systems, so the AI doesn&#x27;t output garbled API requests so much. reply ofermend 3 hours agorootparentTotally agree. retrieval augmented generation is still the preferred way to give the LLM more knowledge. Fine-tuning is mostly useful for adapting the base model for another task. I wrote about this in a recent blog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com&#x2F;fine-tuning-vs-grounded-generation&#x2F;.Anyone knows how this new capability works in terms of where the model inference be done?

Or would fine-tuning on docs + RAG be even more powerful? reply kenjackson 14 hours agorootparentprevWhen I first started working with GPT I was disappointed in this. I thought like the previous commentor that I could fine tune by adding documents and it would add it to the \"knowledge\" of GPT. Instead I had to do what you suggest is vector similarity search, and add the relevant text to the prompt.I do think an open line of research is some way for users to just add arbitrary docs in an easy way to the LLM. reply fdeage 13 hours agorootparentYes, this would definitely be a game changer for almost all companies. Considering how huge the market is, I guess it&#x27;s pretty difficult to do, or it would be done already.I certainly don&#x27;t expect a nice drag-and-drop interface to put my Office files and then ask questions about it coming in 2023. Maybe 2024? reply tempestn 13 hours agorootparentThat would be the absolute game-changer. Something with the \"intelligence\" of GPT-4, but it knows the contents of all your stuff - your documents, project tracker, emails, calendar, etc.Unfortunately even if we do get this, I expect there will be significant ecosystem lock-in. Like, I imagine Microsoft is aiming for something like this, but you&#x27;d need to use all their stuff. reply r_thambapillai 12 hours agorootparentThere are great tools that do this already in a support-multiple-ecosystems kind of way!

It does use a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation approach (rather than fine tuning), but the core reason for that is just that this tends to actually offer better results for end users than fine tuning on the corpus of documents anyway!

My company uses Notion and has an enormous amount of information on there. If I could ask it things like \"Which customer is integrated with tool X\" (we keep a record of this on the customer page in Notion) and get a correct response, that would be immensely helpful to me.

You can do things like fine tune the model you&#x27;re getting embeddings from, fine tune the LLM to craft queries that better match a domain specific format, etc.It won&#x27;t replace the expensive on-the-fly retrieval but it will let you be more accurate in your replies.Also retrieval can be infinitely faster than inference depending on the domain. In well defined domains you can run old school full text search and leverage the LLMs skill at crafting well thought out queries.

The issue is (which has been brought up since the release of the GPT-3 API 3 years ago) that no startup can offer much more value than the API alone offers, and thus it&#x27;s easier, comparatively, than in analogous cases of this type of startup model with other larger companies in the past, for OpenAI to capitalize on this business reply TillE 9 hours agorootparentThis has been the weirdest part of the current wave of AI hype, the idea that you can build some kind of real business on top of somebody else&#x27;s tech which is doing 99.9% of the work.

Given how compressible the models are is there any work being done on using them in some kind of compressed format other than reducing the word size? reply nacs 14 hours agorootparentYes, AutoGPTQ supports this (8, 4, 3, and 2 bit quantization&#x2F;\"compression\" of weights + inference).GPTQ has also been merged into Transformers library recently ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gptq-integration ).GGML quantization format used by llama.cpp also supports (8,6,5,4,3, and 2 bit quantization). reply jacquesm 14 hours agorootparent&#x27;other than&#x27;... reply jmorgan 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are different levels of quantization available for different models (if that&#x27;s what you mean :). E.g. here are the versions available for Llama 2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ollama.ai&#x2F;library&#x2F;llama2&#x2F;tags which go down to 2-bit quantization (which surprisingly still happens to work reasonably well). reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentNo, what I mean is that it seems as though there is quite a bit of sparseness to the matrix and I was wondering if that can somehow be used to further shrink the model, quantization is another effect (it leaves the shape of the various elements as they are but reduces their bit-depth). reply jmorgan 8 hours agorootparentAh, gotcha! I thought you probably meant something else. I&#x27;ve been wondering this too, and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been meaning to look at.On a related note it doesn&#x27;t seem like many local runners are leveraging techniques like PagedAttention yet (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vllm.ai&#x2F;) which is inspired by operating system memory paging to reduce memory requirements for LLMs.It&#x27;s not quite what you mentioned, but it might have a similar effect! Would love to know if you&#x27;ve seen other methods that might help reduce memory requirements.. it&#x27;s one of the largest resource bottlenecks to running LLMs right now! reply jacquesm 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a clever one, I had not seen that yet, thank you.The hint for me is that the models compress so well, that suggests the information content is much lower than the size of the uncompressed model indicates which is a good reason to investigate which parts of the model are so compressible and why. I haven&#x27;t looked at the raw data of these models but maybe I&#x27;ll give it a shot. Sometimes you can learn a lot about the structure (built in or emergent) of data just by staring at the dumps. reply jmorgan 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s quite interesting.

In my conversations with execs that’s been a serious concern — basically that generated output from AI systems can’t be reliably protected.I refer to the concept that output could be deemed free of copyright because they are not created by a human author, or that derivative works can be potential liabilities because they resemble works that were used for training data or whatnot (and we have no idea what was really used to train).There was the recent court decision confirming:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cooley.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;insight&#x2F;2023&#x2F;2023-08-24-district...Seems odd to start making AI systems a data-at-the-center-of-the-company technology when such basic issues exist.Is this not a concern anymore? reply CobrastanJorji 13 hours agoparentI think they&#x27;re basically taking the \"Uber\" strategy here: primary business is probably illegal, but if they do it hard enough and at enough scale and create enough value for enough big companies, then they become big enough to either get regulations changed or strong enough to weather lawsuits and prosecutions.

There really hasn&#x27;t traditionally been any lower bound on how \"minimal\" the \"spark\" need be -- flick a dot of paint at a canvas, snap a photo without looking at what you&#x27;re photographing, it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as a human initiated the work somehow.However, the Copyright Office contends that AI-generated text and images do not contain a minimal creative spark:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;ai&#x2F;ai_policy_guidance.pdfThis is obviously asinine. Typing in \"a smiling dolphin\" on Midjourney and getting an image of a smiling dolphin is clearly not a program \"operat[ing] randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author\".If our laws have meaning, it will be overruled in court.Of course, judges are also susceptible to the marketing-driven idea that Artificial Intelligence is a separate being, a translucent stock photo robot with glowing blue wiring that thinks up ideas independently instead of software you must run with a creative input. So there&#x27;s no guarantee sanity will prevail. reply choppaface 13 hours agorootparentNot so much copyrighting generated output, it’s more about to what extent training is fair use as well as when the algo spits out an exact copy of training data. reply lucubratory 7 hours agorootparentIf the model produces content that would be a copyright violation in any other context, it doesn&#x27;t stop being a copyright violation regardless of any of these decisions. No one has ever disagreed with that; it&#x27;s the functional abolition of copyright and if you&#x27;re okay with that, then you&#x27;re not arguing for this stuff, you&#x27;re arguing for the abolition of copyright.The argument is that if you trained the model with copyrighted data, and then you or someone else separately used the model to generate novel media which was not legally similar enough to any copyrighted work to make it a copyright violation, that that isn&#x27;t violating copyright, it&#x27;s fair use. Basically, using it to make your own original content is legal, and using it to create an unauthorised reproduction of a copyrighted work is illegal.

This story has been told before (e.g., by my friend Aditya who was also involved and by the Stanford Daily), but I wanted to share my talk here for posterity. The following is an approximate transcript. (If the language feels terse, that’s why.) I’ve added a few links and cleaned up some of the language for clarity. The hack itself Hey everyone! I’m going to briefly share my experience receiving a legal threat for good-faith security research, and then I’m going to share three key takeaways I had from this quite unpleasant experience. But first, shoutout to Adi and the whole Applied Cybersecurity crew. Adi was one of my collaborators on this disclosure, and we wouldn’t have been able to stand up for ourselves like we did if it wasn’t for the Stanford Applied Cyber community. Last October, a Stanford student startup called Fizz started getting popular on campus. It was an anonymous social media app that claimed to be something like “100% secure”. What could go wrong? Well, a me and few security-minded friends were drawn like moths to a flame when we heard that. Our classmates were posting quite sensitive stories on Fizz, and we wanted to make sure their information was secure. So one Friday night, we decided to explore whether Fizz was really “100% secure” like they claimed. Well, dear reader, Fizz was not 100% secure. In fact, they hardly had any security protections at all. In only a few hours, we were able to gain full read and write access to their database, where they were storing all their user and post information — entirely deanonymized. Disclosing the vulnerability to Fizz So we did what any good security researcher does: We responsibly disclosed what we found. We wrote a detailed vulnerability disclosure report. We suggested remediations. And we proactively agreed not to talk about our findings publicly before an embargo date to give them time to fix the issues. Then we sent them the report via email. At first, they were grateful. They thanked us for our report and said that fixing the issues was their top priority. Then a few weeks passed. They sent us some updates. And then, one day, they sent us a threat. A crazy threat. I remember it vividly. I was just finishing a run when the email came in. And my heart rate went up after I stopped running. That’s not what’s supposed to happen. They said that we had violated state and federal law. They threatened us with civil and criminal charges. 20 years in prison. They really just threw everything they could at us. And at the end of their threat they had a demand: don’t ever talk about your findings publicly. Essentially, if you agree to silence, we won’t pursue legal action. We had five days to respond. They wanted to scare us into silence. We’re going to need a lawyer What do you do when you get a letter like this? Well, I kind of freaked out. I was angry and scared. Here’s the first thing my friend Cooper said in our disclosure group chat when we got the threat: “Stay calm. Don’t do anything fucking stupid. We’re going to need a lawyer.” If you can’t tell from his wisdom, it was not Cooper’s first time dealing with legal threats. We started asking for help in our network, and within a few days, we were connected with Kurt and Andrew at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Kurt and Andrew generously agreed to represent us in our response to the letter pro bono. We walked them through our disclosure and all our documentation. And with their advice, we made the decision not to cave to Fizz’s threats. That’s why I’m here on stage right now talking to you. Kurt and Andrew drafted a response to Fizz. They really shut it down. (The Stanford Daily published Fizz’s threat and EFF’s response. I really recommend that you read these docs if you haven’t already. They’re crazy.) The Fizz team then asked to meet, and we were able to resolve the situation amicably. We pushed Fizz to proactively disclose the issues to their own users, which they eventually did. Relecting on a stressful time Now let’s take a quick step back. Getting a legal threat for our good-faith security research was incredibly stressful. And the fact that it came from our classmates added insult to injury. I have three key takeaways from this experience I want to share. Keep your research above-board and well-documented. Ahead of time, think about what you’re trying to accomplish with your research and make sure that you’re not crossing any ethical lines. A big reason why we were able to resolve this amicably — and why EFF was able to respond to Fizz’s threat so thoroughly — was that we played by the rules. We didn’t save or leak the data we had access to. We didn’t mess with anyone’s account. We didn’t cause any damage. And we kept detailed documented of everything we did. That clean documentation was incredibly helpful for us as we wrote up our vulnerability disclosure report. I imagine it also made Kurt and Andrew’s job representing us a lot easier. Stay calm. I can’t tell you how much I wanted to curse out the Fizz team over email. But no. We had to keep it professional — even as they resorted to legal scare tactics. Your goal when you get a legal threat is to stay out of trouble. To resolve the situation. That’s it. The temporary satisfaction of saying “fuck you” isn’t worth giving up the possibility of an amicable resolution. Get a lawyer. We could have tried to navigate the process on our own. But that would have been a profound mistake. They would have likely escalated. After all, they were banking on us being naive and caving to their scare tactics. Thankfully, Kurt and Andrew swooped in and saved the day. Now, not everyone has the ability to get EFF to represent them pro bono. But there are an increasing number of resources available to good-faith security researchers who face legal threats, and you should make use of them. Don’t try to fly solo. Thank you. I then handed things off to Charley Snyder, the Head of Security Policy at Google, who spoke about his experience on the other side of the vulnerability disclosure process. Hi!

It&#x27;s very clear from their disclosure and behavior after disclosing that they were in good faith conducting security research, making them an unattractive target for prosecution.2. It&#x27;s not clear that they did any meaningful damage (this is subtle: you can easily rack up 5-6 figure damage numbers from unauthorized security research, but Fizz was so small and new that I&#x27;m assuming nobody even contemplating retaining a forensics firm or truing things up with their insurers, who probably did not exist), meaning there wouldn&#x27;t have been much to prosecute.3. Fizz&#x27;s lawyers fucked up and threatened a criminal prosecution in order to obtain a valuable concession fro the researchers, which, as EFF points out, violates a state bar rule.I think the good guys prevailed here, but I&#x27;m wary of taking too many lessons from this; if this hadn&#x27;t been \"Fizz\", but rather the social media features of Dunder Mifflin Infinity, the outcome might have been gnarlier. reply tptacek 14 hours agoparentA friend points out that the limb EFF was out on was sturdy indeed, since DOJ has issued a policy statement saying they&#x27;re not going after good-faith security research.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;department-justice-announces-... reply Ajedi32 13 hours agorootparentTo me that reads less as \"this is legal\" and more as \"this is illegal, but we (the executive branch of the government) will be nice and not go after you for it as long as we think you&#x27;re a good guy\". That&#x27;s (arguably) better than nothing, but not exactly an ideal way to structure our justice system in my opinion. reply deepsun 13 hours agorootparentYes, but I don&#x27;t see a better solution. If we make \"security research\" legal, then any hacker can just say \"oh I was just going to disclose my findings to them\". reply philistine 12 hours agorootparentHere’s a better solution: change the laws!Knowing the audience of this forum, you’re probably American and under 35. You have lived your whole life with an inoperable legislator. The US Congress, through a mixture of time-honored traditions with unfathomable externalities (there can never be more than this amount of representatives) and disinterested sports-like politics, is unable to print new laws in a reactive fashion. This means that kludges, with their own unfathomable externalities, look like sane solutions. They’re not. A functioning democracy would set up a legal framework for ethical research. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentYou get that the legal situation for this stuff is even gnarlier in Europe, right? reply McDyver 4 hours agorootparentBelgium legalises ethical hacking:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.kuleuven.be&#x2F;citip&#x2F;blog&#x2F;belgium-legalises-eth...HN thread from 4 months ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35847860 reply kevin_nisbet 5 hours agorootparentprevWell, the thing about making security research legal is that the law can outline what is legal and illegal security research, instead of leaving it in a grey area of a policy statement that may change at any time without notice, or from a political agenda.A well executed law change will make it very clear where the line is to get into illegal territory and would likely include industry feedback in the drafting. The downside is it could also go the other way, policy changes are executed by politicians who likely have a fairly poor grasp of the tech and industry, and could leave the policy in a worse shape until tested by the court system.If the law were to say outline steps the hacker must do, barriers that can&#x27;t cross, it may actually make it harder for a hacker to say I was just doing research. reply giantg2 12 hours agorootparentprevNot really, many professional researchers notify law enforcement when engaging in something that could be viewed as illegal or generate calls to the police.What should happen is the addition of a \"reasonable\" standard and using existing case law policy positions to not prosecute people who have a reasonable basis supporting their claim of security research.Instead we&#x27;ll be left with the lazy lawmakers doing nothing and the executive saying they&#x27;ll prosecute only the people who \"deserve\" it. reply seanw444 12 hours agorootparentI hate the use of \"reasonable\" in law. Who&#x27;s to define what&#x27;s reasonable? reply singleshot_ 10 hours agorootparentAny time you see that word you can be pretty sure that the matter under consideration is a fact question for the jury. The reason you hate that word is because you prefer hard and fast, bright line rules. That’s fine, I do too.Reasonable just means there’s no good way to have a bright line rule and we have to consider these questions one at a time, in context. reply opello 9 hours agorootparentAs someone also frustrated by this vernacular I really appreciate this perspective. Thanks! reply dannyphantom 12 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s fair.The use of \"reasonable\" in generally used to qualify some standard of behavior or conduct that is expected from individuals in specific situations. Because \"reasonable\" is inherently subjective, the responsibility for making the determination is (generally) passed over to a jury who will weigh what the prosecution and defense have presented which entails previous cases, the specific fact pattern of the case being deliberated, etc.There are also situations where an actual judge makes the determination but generally, in a criminal context, it&#x27;s up to a jury. reply dmvdoug 10 hours agorootparentI don’t think you’re viewing it quite correctly. Reasonableness standards usually exist in order to funnel legal compulsion into a narrower range than would exist without them. It can bracket out behavior that to the average, ordinary, everyday member of that particular community would be extreme on one end or the other. You generally don’t want the law to require people to behave in extraordinarily heroic or extraordinarily cautious ways compared to how an ordinary person under similar circumstances would act. And “ordinary” here is also context-sensitive. What’s reasonable for an ordinary teenager may be extremely impulsive or foolish for an ordinary adult. Or what’s reasonable for an ordinary expert in a field may be wildly dangerous, say, for an ordinary layman.All that said, though, reasonableness standards exist all over the law and don’t all necessarily serve the same purpose or function exactly in the same way, when you get into the weeds. reply deepsun 11 hours agorootparentprevSimilar in flight rules: one cannot fly a paraglider over \"congested area\". But what is \"congested area\" is intentionally not defined in the rules, and left up to judges to decide for each case separately.Because if FAA tries to come up with a definition, there will always be weird unjust corner cases. Or just ban the paragliders whatsoever. I think the current ambiguity is the best compromise. reply buttercraft 12 hours agorootparentprevJudges and juries reply singleshot_ 10 hours agorootparentYou are right, but there is more to it.Judges typically consider matters of law. Usually “reasonable” is a cue that you are discussing a matter of fact, which is the province of the jury.Sometimes you will have something called a bench trial, where it is agreed that the judge will also serve the role of the fact finder, and there will be no jury. reply dmvdoug 10 hours agorootparent> Usually “reasonable” is a cue that you are discussing a matter of fact, which is the province of the jury.And then there are motions for a JMOL (see FRCP 50), where a judge has to decide whether a “reasonable jury” could have a legally sufficient basis to find in favor of a party.Law as the verkehrte Welt of itself. :) reply giantg2 9 hours agorootparentprevI generally hate it too. But it is better than \"it&#x27;s illegal, but we won&#x27;t prosecute researchers\". Note that \"researchers\" is also undefined. Reasonable would be one step up for the even worse status quo. reply whimsicalism 13 hours agorootparentprevYou aren’t a lawyer, right? reply ZoomerCretin 12 hours agorootparentLaws are written by legislators, not the Department of Justice. An administrative decision by the executive branch does not change that fact. Accessing a computer system without explicit authorization or \"hacking\" is a federal crime. If you \"hack\", you can be charged with a felony for doing so at the discretion of federal prosecutors. The law isn&#x27;t some magical too-incomprehensible-for-mortals text requiring magicians and soothsayers to interpret _literally_ every single clause and statement for you. As an adult citizen of a country (with an IQ above room temperature), you should be able to correctly interpret statements like the above, as was done by the person to whom you replied. reply doctorpangloss 14 hours agorootparentprevSo then you’d concede that all that’s left is these Fizzbuzz people are liars and are bad people, and that their product is crap and should not be used, and you don’t need to have personally used the app nor met them personally to know any of that, since it’s all clear from their extremely obnoxious, self destructive conduct, and that that’s just an opinion and not a forecast on whether or not their useless investors will get a return? reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentPerhaps you missed this line from my original comment:I think the good guys prevailed here. reply doctorpangloss 13 hours agorootparentYeah definitely. It’s just to say that the security researchers, these classmates, didn’t get lucky. Like if I were a Stanford student, and I heard about this shitty website, you know, if I were generalizing, I wouldn’t be wrong to guess it was run by obnoxious people and that the technology was a big lie.And this website, this forum, it has a maligned love affair with the anti establishment characters, and it can’t really figure out this one because it’s dropouts v. hackers on the face of it. Most of the comments are litigating the law, by non lawyers and even when by lawyers, by people who absolutely could not predict the future of a legal decision. Why not just trust your gut? What I want to hear - what I want to be the #1 comment forever and for all time, which is just my opinion - is like, this research never needed to happen to know that Fizz or whatever is absolute trash. Do you see what I am saying?There are a lot of 18-22 year olds pursuing entrepreneurship out of college aged vengeances. Y Combinator funds many such founders! And here we see the double edged sword: if you’re at Stanford touting yourself an entrepreneurial genius with your app about antagonizing your classmates, you had better actually bring the bacon to your supposed technology. Because you have more than your founding team’s worth of classmates who hate your guts, but can actually program. reply asynchronous 13 hours agorootparentprevI remember when the DOJ announced that and it still isn&#x27;t good enough to protect security researchers by saying “we won’t prosecute, trust us” reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agoparentprev> this is subtle: you can easily rack up 5-6 figure damage numbers from unauthorized security research, but Fizz was so small and new that I&#x27;m assuming nobody even contemplating retaining a forensics firm or truing things up with their insurers, who probably did not existThis seems like a problem with the existing law, if that&#x27;s how it works.It puts the amount of \"damages\" in the hands of the \"victim\" who can choose to spend arbitrary amounts of resources (trivial in the scope of a large bureaucracy but large in absolute amount), providing a perverse incentive to waste resources in order to vindictively trigger harsh penalties against an imperfect actor whose true transgression was to embarrass them.And it improperly assigns the cost of such measures, even to the extent that they&#x27;re legitimate, to the person who merely brought their attention to the need for them. If you&#x27;ve been operating a publicly available service with a serious vulnerability you still have to go through everything and evaluate the scope of the compromise regardless of whether or not this person did anything inappropriate, in case someone else did. The source of that cost was their own action in operating a vulnerable service -- they should still be incurring it even if they discovered the vulnerability themselves, but not before putting it in production.The damages attributable to the accused should be limited to the damage they actually caused, for example by using access to obtain customer financial information and committing credit card fraud. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentA forensics investigation is usually required by insurers. It&#x27;s not an arbitrary amount of money, it&#x27;s just an amount you&#x27;re not happy with. I understand why you feel that way, but it&#x27;s not the way the law works. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentServices can negotiate the terms of their insurance contract or even choose whether or not to carry insurance. They agree to these terms and know the implications, and again, if the need for the investigation is legitimate then they should be conducting it regardless of how the vulnerability is uncovered.> it&#x27;s not the way the law works.Which is problematic. reply woah 13 hours agorootparentprev> This seems like a problem with the existing law, if that&#x27;s how it works.> I understand why you feel that way, but it&#x27;s not the way the law works.OP was saying they don&#x27;t think the law should work that way. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentWait&#x27;ll they learn about the Eggshell Skull Rule. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparentThis is more in the neighborhood of contributory negligence. reply singleshot_ 10 hours agorootparentprevStrange things happen every day but in my experience the jury decides on the damages, not the plaintiff. reply AnthonyMouse 4 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re talking about what rule the law should intend to be used, not who applies the rule. reply emilecantin 15 hours agoparentprevI presume that the \"limb\" the EFF attorney went on is basically what would&#x27;ve been disputed in a court of law. It&#x27;s easily argued that if an app is so badly configured that just _following the Firebase protocol_ can give you write access to the database, you haven&#x27;t actually circumvented any security measures, because _there weren&#x27;t any to circumvent_.It reminds me of the case where AT&T had their iPad data subscriber data just sitting there on an unlisted webpage. Don&#x27;t remember which way it went, but I think the guy went out of his way there to get all the data he could get, which isn&#x27;t the case here. reply dahfizz 14 hours agorootparentIANAL, but the law does not require you to \"circumvent\" anything[1].Simply, anyone who \"accesses a computer without authorization ... and thereby obtains ... information from any protected computer\" is in violation of the CFAA.If the researchers in question did not download any customer data, nor cause any \"damages\", I am not sure they are guilty of anything. BUT, if they had, \"the victim had insufficient security measures\" is not a valid defense. These researchers were not authorized to access this computer, regardless of whether they were technically able to obtain access.Leaving your door unlocked does not give burglars permission to burgle you.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;1030 reply supermatt 12 hours agorootparent> accesses a computer without authorizationThey were authorized, as per the permissions that fizz gave users of the app on firebase. A group of users noticed that it was overly permissive and reported it to them.> Leaving your door unlocked does not give burglars permission to burgle you.This is more like giving your stuff away and then reporting it as theft. reply dahfizz 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s nothing like that. Fizz did not want these people making admin accounts on their server. That&#x27;s the bottom line. They failed to prevent it (forgot to lock their door), but in no way did they actively \"give their stuff away\". No judge would see it that way. reply bagels 13 hours agorootparentprevEveryone that is doing security research without permission, and doesn&#x27;t catch charges, is just luckier (or less annoying) than weev: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;att-hacker-gets-3-years&#x2F; reply jrockway 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s my understanding of the law. Even the \"merge this PR without review using your administrator privileges\" is potentially a crime if the company policy doesn&#x27;t allow you to take that action. Basically, what the code does or intends is not a factor at all, only the potentially-implicit authorization policy controls.If I tell you \"the password on the postgres account at postgres.jrock.us is blahblah42\" and you read the database, it could be argued that you&#x27;re exceeding your authorized access. The reason people don&#x27;t tell you their database password on Hacker News is because of countries that don&#x27;t have that law, I assume. reply yebyen 14 hours agorootparent> The reason people don&#x27;t tell you their database password on Hacker News is because of countries that don&#x27;t have that law, I assume.That&#x27;s silly, the reason people protect themselves is so that they are protected. Legal protection is another different kind of protection, but I think it&#x27;s a deep stretch to argue that one can remove all the technical protections and still keep access to the CFAA and obtain meaningful protection from the law.> protected computerIf you&#x27;re suggesting that the CFAA itself protects the computer by definition, then you&#x27;ve excluded the possibility of a such thing as an \"unprotected computer\" which renders the extra word unnecessary. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the intention, that all computers gain the implicit protection, I think there actually needs to be a policy or standard enforced, or ownership made clear.In the tradition of US property law, I think you need to do the bare minimum of posting \"NO TRESPASSING\" signs at the border so anyone that walks by them can be said to have observed the difference between your space and the public spaces surrounding it (which they are permitted to be in, just like your private property so long as it&#x27;s unprotected and they haven&#x27;t been asked to leave before...) reply jrockway 14 hours agorootparent> That&#x27;s sillyYeah, of course ;)> In the tradition of US property law, I think you need to do the bare minimum of posting \"NO TRESPASSING\" signs at the borderI guess the law went for an allowlist instead of a denylist this time. Plus one point on their security audit!> protected computerAs an aside, sometimes I wonder why people make threats like \"you must not link to this site without permission\". It&#x27;s like saying \"you must not look at my house as you walk by it\". You can ask, but it&#x27;s Not A Thing. I worry that the language could potentially confuse a court someday. (Or that it already did.) reply dahfizz 14 hours agorootparentprevThe term \"protected computer\" is defined in the CFAA act[1].Basically its any computer used by a bank, the federal government, or used in interstate commerce.This is just a quirk of the US system of government.

(It sounds like that&#x27;s more precisely what happened here, I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t read it all...) reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t complicated. You can be convicted of breaking & entering through an open door. At trial, your defense will have to convince a jury that a reasonable person would believe they were entitled to go through the door. If the door was to, say, a Starbucks, that defense will be compelling indeed. If it is to a private home owned by strangers, you&#x27;ll be convicted.I think that&#x27;s roughly how it will play out in a CFAA case too: the case will turn on why it was you thought you were authorized to tinker with the things you tinkered with. If, as is so often encouraged on HN, your defense turns on the meanings of HTTP response codes, you&#x27;ll likely be convicted. On the other hand, if you can tell a convincing story about how anybody who understands a little about how a browser works would think that they were just taking a shortcut to something the site owner wanted them to do anyways, you&#x27;re much more likely to be OK.If you create an admin account in the database, it won&#x27;t much matter what position the door was in, so to speak.The concept we&#x27;re dancing around here is mens rea.(Again: DOJ has issued a policy statement saying they&#x27;re not going after cases like this Fizz thing, so this is all moot anyways.) reply yebyen 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple. The prosecution will have to prove the intent to commit a crime. If it looks like a service that should require authorization, and the door is swinging wide open, I think there&#x27;s a decent argument to be made that you can&#x27;t prove a reasonable neighbor&#x27;s intent wasn&#x27;t to perform a welfare check, and with no criminal intent there is no crime of burglary.If my neighbor leaves his door open (in the winter, say), and I have cause to believe that something is wrong based on that, is a jury going to convict me for going in there to check on them? It really sounds like that&#x27;s what was done here.I guess creating an admin account while I&#x27;m in there is a bit like making a key for myself while I look around. That might be over the line. But without that step, I&#x27;m not sure how you can have proved that something was even wrong...I&#x27;ll go read the article now. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentThe crime in this case is accessing software running on someone else&#x27;s computer without their authorization. The \"someone else\" in this case vehemently objects to the access at issue. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, but their argument is compelling enough that it&#x27;s the defendant who&#x27;d have to do the explaining.No: you will not get convicted checking on your neighbor. Everybody involved in that fact pattern will believe that you at the time believed it was OK for you to peek into their house.

Breaking includes moving in a significant manner anything that barred the way into the (building) (ship) (vessel) (vehicle). Examples would include such things as (opening a closed door whether locked or unlocked) (opening a closed window whether locked or unlocked) (going in through an open window that is not intended for use as an entrance). On the other hand, going through an unobstructed entrance such as an open door does not constitute a breaking.(Italicized emphasis is mine.) Entering through an open door appears to be an entering (the second element of the crime), but not a breaking (the first element).

They weren’t acting like classmates themselves. They were acting like professionals.

It&#x27;s crazy to me to think that a U.S. company would voluntarily ever do anything in the interest of any of its employees, ever. This is the whole reason why ambiguities are supposed to go in favor of the party that didn&#x27;t write it. Voiding any part of an employee contract can therefore only ever benefit the employee (except possibly the part where they get paid).

It protects both parties from squirreling out of an entire legal obligation on a technicality, or writing poison pills into a contract you know won&#x27;t stand up to legal scrutiny.If part of the contract is invalidated, they can&#x27;t leverage it. If that part being invalidated changes the contract fundamentally, the entire contract is voided. What more do you want?It seems like you&#x27;re arguing for some sort of punitive response to authoring a bad contract? That seems like a pretty awful idea re: chilling effect on all legal&#x2F;business relationship formation, and wouldn&#x27;t that likely impact the weaker parties worse as they have less access to high-powered legal authors? That means that even negotiating wording changes to a contract becomes a liability nightmare for the negotiators, doesn&#x27;t that make the potential liability burden even more lopsided against small actors sitting across the table from entire legal teams?I guess I&#x27;m having trouble seeing how the world you&#x27;re imagining wouldn&#x27;t end up introducing bigger risk for weaker parties than the world we&#x27;re already in. reply cj 14 hours agorootparentPractical example: your employment agreement has a non-compete clause.

There&#x27;s obviously a gray area here. So not for mistakes, subtle technicalities. But if one party is being intentionally or absurdly overreaching then yes, I believe there should be some proportional punishment. Particularly if the writing party&#x27;s intent is to scare out of inaction more than a core belief that their wording is true.The way I think of it is maybe in similar terms as disbarring or something like that. So not something that would be a day-to-day concern for honest people doing honest work, but some potential negative consequences if \"you&#x27;re taking it too far\" (of course this last bit is completely handwavy).Maybe such a mechanism exists that I&#x27;m not aware of. reply gingerrr 11 hours agorootparentI do like the idea theoretically as a deterrent against bad actors abusing the law to bully weaker parties - but the difficult part is in the details of implementation: how do you separate intent to abuse from incompetence?Also confusing the mix here is who you are punishing when violations are found - is it the attorneys drafting the agreement? They&#x27;re as likely to be unaffiliated with the company executing the contract as not, not everyone bothers with in-house counsel. Is it the company leadership forwarding the contract?What&#x27;s the scope of the punishment? An embargo on all new legal agreements for a period of time, or only with the parties to the bad contract? A requirement for change in legal representation? Now we get into overreach questions on the punishment side.All of that to say I am guessing the reason something like this doesn&#x27;t exist yet afaik is because it&#x27;s a logistical nightmare to actually put into practice.The closest I can think of to something that might work is like a credit score&#x2F;rating for companies for \"contract integrity\" or something that goes down with negative rulings - but what 3rd party would own that? Even just the thought experiment spawns too many subqueries to resolve simply.None of that contradicts the fact it&#x27;s a good idea - just not sure if even possible to bring to life! reply nostrademons 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m reminded of the concept of a \"tact filter\", which is basically \"do you alter what you say to avoid causing offense, or do you alter what you hear to avoid taking offense?\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mit.edu&#x2F;~jcb&#x2F;tact.htmlThe part the original essay leaves out is that optimal behavior depends on the scale and persistence of the relationship. In personal, 1:1, long-term relationships, you should apply outgoing tact filters because if you cause offense you&#x27;ve torched the relationship permanently and will suffer long-term consequences from it. But in public discourse, many-to-many, transactional relationships, it&#x27;s better to apply incoming tact filters because there are so many people you interact with that invariably there will be someone who forgot to set their outgoing tact filter. (And in public discourse where you have longstanding relationships with your customers with serious negative consequences for pissing them off, you want to be very, very careful what you say. The entire field of PR is devoted to this.)So anyone who spends a significant amount of time with the general public basically needs to develop a translation layer. \"i hope you hang yourself\" on an Internet forum becomes \"somebody had a bad day and is letting off steam by trolling.\" \"Your business is probably in violation of federal labor laws because you haven&#x27;t displayed these $400 posters we&#x27;re trying to sell you\" becomes \"Better download some PDFs off the Department of Labor for free\" [1]. \"We&#x27;re calling from XYZ Collection Agency about your debt\" or \"This is the Deputy Sheriffs office. You have a warrant out for your arrest for failing to appear for jury duty\" or \"This is the IRS calling requesting you pay back taxes in the amount of $X over the phone\" = ignore them and hang up because it&#x27;s a scam. \"Continued involvement in Russia&#x27;s internal affairs will lead to nuclear consequences\" = Putin is feeling insecure with his base and needs to rattle some sabers to maintain support. \"You are in violation of several state and federal laws facing up to 20 years in prison\" = they want something from me, lawyer up and make sure we&#x27;re not in violation and then let&#x27;s negotiate.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.gov&#x2F;general&#x2F;topics&#x2F;posters reply MajimasEyepatch 15 hours agoparentprevThere is obviously such a thing as going too far, but it&#x27;s kind of hard to draw a clear line. In a good faith context, laws and precedents can change quickly, sometimes based on the whim of a judge, and there are many areas of law where there is no clear precedent or where guidance is fuzzy. In those cases, it&#x27;s important to have severability so that entire contracts don&#x27;t have to be renegotiated because one small clause didn&#x27;t hold up in court.Imagine an employment contract that contains a non-compete clause (ignore, for a moment, your personal beliefs about non-compete clauses). The company may have a single employment contract that they use everywhere, and so in states where non-competes are illegal, the severability clause allows them to avoid having separate contracts for each jurisdiction. And now suppose that a state that once allowed non-competes passes a law banning them: should every employment contract with a non-compete clause suddenly become null and void? Of course not. That&#x27;s what severability is for.In the case in the OP, it&#x27;s hard to say what the context is of the threat, but I imagine something along the lines of, \"Unauthorized access to our computer network is a federal crime under statute XYZ punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\" Scary as hell to a layperson, but it&#x27;s not strictly speaking untrue, even if most lawyers would roll their eyes and say that they&#x27;re full of shit. Sure, it&#x27;s misleading, and a bad actor could easily take it too far, but it&#x27;s hard to know exactly where to draw the line if lawyers couch a threat in enough qualifiers.At the end of the day, documents like this are written by lawyers in legalese that&#x27;s not designed for ordinary people. It&#x27;s shitty that they threatened some college students with this, and whatever lawyer did write and send this letter on behalf of the company gave that company tremendously poor advice. I guess you could complain to the bar, but it would be very hard to make a compelling case in a situation like this.(This is also one of the reasons why collective bargaining is so valuable. A union can afford legal representation to go toe to toe with the company&#x27;s lawyers. Individual employees can&#x27;t do that.) reply notpushkin 14 hours agorootparent> At the end of the day, documents like this are written by lawyers in legalese that&#x27;s not designed for ordinary people.Does it have to be this way? reply hnfong 5 hours agorootparent\"Legalese\" can often be simplified, but concepts that are necessarily in law are often not widely known by lay people, and as such it&#x27;s hard to avoid some terminology and reasoning that require a bit of legal training to understand.But every subject and field has their own set of terminology. It&#x27;s just like programming -- while we strive to make code easier to understand (eg. Python is better than assembler in this regard), there&#x27;s still a necessary learning curve. Your question is almost like asking \"why can&#x27;t we just tell the computer what we want to do in plain English?\"Sometimes the legalese is actually comprehensible if you give it a bit of patience.

The contract says no lunch breaks but CalOSHA regulations say 30 minutes required, the contractor can&#x27;t violate the contract in its&#x27; entirety, they just take the breaks and amend the contract if the employer pushes it.I disagree with OP - a judge can always choose to invalidate a contract, regardless of severability.

    "originBody": "Dark Mode Toggle What do I think about Community Notes? 2023 Aug 16 See all posts Special thanks to Dennis Pourteaux and Jay Baxter for feedback and review. The last two years of Twitter X have been tumultuous, to say the least. After the platform was bought not bought bought by Elon Musk for $44 billion last year, Elon enacted sweeping changes to the company's staffing, content moderation and business model, not to mention changes to the culture on the site that may well have been a result of Elon's soft power more than any specific policy decision. But in the middle of these highly contentious actions, one new feature on Twitter grew rapidly in importance, and seems to be beloved by people across the political spectrum: Community Notes. Community Notes is a fact-checking tool that sometimes attaches context notes, like the one on Elon's tweet above, to tweets as a fact-checking and anti-misinformation tool. It was originally called Birdwatch, and was first rolled out as a pilot project in January 2021. Since then, it has expanded in stages, with the most rapid phase of its expansion coinciding with Twitter's takeover by Elon last year. Today, Community Notes appear frequently on tweets that get a very large audience on Twitter, including those on contentious political topics. And both in my view, and in the view of many people across the political spectrum I talk to, the notes, when they appear, are informative and valuable. But what interests me most about Community Notes is how, despite not being a \"crypto project\", it might be the closest thing to an instantiation of \"crypto values\" that we have seen in the mainstream world. Community Notes are not written or curated by some centrally selected set of experts; rather, they can be written and voted on by anyone, and which notes are shown or not shown is decided entirely by an open source algorithm. The Twitter site has a detailed and extensive guide describing how the algorithm works, and you can download the data containing which notes and votes have been published, run the algorithm locally, and verify that the output matches what is visible on the Twitter site. It's not perfect, but it's surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality, all while being impressively useful, even under contentious conditions, at the same time. How does the Community Notes algorithm work? Anyone with a Twitter account matching some criteria (basically: active for 6+ months, no recent rule violations, verified phone number) can sign up to participate in Community Notes. Currently, participants are slowly and randomly being accepted, but eventually the plan is to let in anyone who fits the criteria. Once you are accepted, you can at first participate in rating existing notes, and once you've made enough good ratings (measured by seeing which ratings match with the final outcome for that note), you can also write notes of your own. When you write a note, the note gets a score based on the reviews that it receives from other Community Notes members. These reviews can be thought of as being votes along a 3-point scale of HELPFUL, SOMEWHAT_HELPFUL and NOT_HELPFUL, but a review can also contain some other tags that have roles in the algorithm. Based on these reviews, a note gets a score. If the note's score is above 0.40, the note is shown; otherwise, the note is not shown. The way that the score is calculated is what makes the algorithm unique. Unlike simpler algorithms, which aim to simply calculate some kind of sum or average over users' ratings and use that as the final result, the Community Notes rating algorithm explicitly attempts to prioritize notes that receive positive ratings from people across a diverse range of perspectives. That is, if people who usually disagree on how they rate notes end up agreeing on a particular note, that note is scored especially highly. Let us get into the deep math of how this works. We have a set of users and a set of notes; we can create a matrix 𝑀 , where the cell 𝑀 𝑖 , 𝑗 represents how the i'th user rated the j'th note. For any given note, most users have not rated that note, so most entries in the matrix will be zero, but that's fine. The goal of the algorithm is to create a four-column model of users and notes, assigning each user two stats that we can call \"friendliness\" and \"polarity\", and each note two stats that we can call \"helpfulness\" and \"polarity\". The model is trying to predict the matrix as a function of these values, using the following formula: Note that here I am introducing both the terminology used in the Birdwatch paper, and my own terms to provide a less mathematical intuition for what the variables mean: μ is a \"general public mood\" parameter that accounts for how high the ratings are that users give in general 𝑖 𝑢 is a user's \"friendliness\": how likely that particular user is to give high ratings 𝑖 𝑛 is a note's \"helpfulness\": how likely that particular note is to get rated highly. Ultimately, this is the variable we care about. 𝑓 𝑢 or 𝑓 𝑛 is user or note's \"polarity\": its position among the dominant axis of political polarization. In practice, negative polarity roughly means \"left-leaning\" and positive polarity means \"right-leaning\", but note that the axis of polarization is discovered emergently from analyzing users and notes; the concepts of leftism and rightism are in no way hard-coded. The algorithm uses a pretty basic machine learning model (standard gradient descent) to find values for these variables that do the best possible job of predicting the matrix values. The helpfulness that a particular note is assigned is the note's final score. If a note's helpfulness is at least +0.4, the note gets shown. The core clever idea here is that the \"polarity\" terms absorb the properties of a note that cause it to be liked by some users and not others, and the \"helpfulness\" term only measures the properties that a note has that cause it to be liked by all. Thus, selecting for helpfulness identifies notes that get cross-tribal approval, and selects against notes that get cheering from one tribe at the expense of disgust from the other tribe. I made a simplified implementation of the basic algorithm; you can find it here, and are welcome to play around with it. Now, the above is only a description of the central core of the algorithm. In reality, there are a lot of extra mechanisms bolted on top. Fortunately, they are described in the public documentation. These mechanisms include the following: The algorithm gets run many times, each time adding some randomly generated extreme \"pseudo-votes\" to the votes. This means that the algorithm's true output for each note is a range of values, and the final result depends on a \"lower confidence bound\" taken from this range, which is checked against a threshold of 0.32. If many users (especially users with a similar polarity to the note) rate a note \"Not Helpful\", and furthermore they specify the same \"tag\" (eg. \"Argumentative or biased language\", \"Sources do not support note\") as the reason for their rating, the helpfulness threshold required for the note to be published increases from 0.4 to 0.5 (this looks small but it's very significant in practice) If a note is accepted, the threshold that its helpfulness must drop below to de-accept it is 0.01 points lower than the threshold that a note's helpfulness needed to reach for the note to be originally accepted The algorithm gets run even more times with multiple models, and this can sometimes promote notes whose original helpfulness score is somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4 All in all, you get some pretty complicated python code that amounts to 6282 lines stretching across 22 files. But it is all open, you can download the note and rating data and run it yourself, and see if the outputs correspond to what is actually on Twitter at any given moment. So how does this look in practice? Probably the single most important idea in this algorithm that distinguishes it from naively taking an average score from people's votes is what I call the \"polarity\" values. The algorithm documentation calls them 𝑓 𝑢 and 𝑓 𝑛 , using 𝑓 for factor because these are the two terms that get multiplied with each other; the more general language is in part because of a desire to eventually make 𝑓 𝑢 and 𝑓 𝑛 multi-dimensional. Polarity is assigned to both users and notes. The link between user IDs and the underlying Twitter accounts is intentionally kept hidden, but notes are public. In practice, the polarities generated by the algorithm, at least for the English-language data set, map very closely to the left vs right political spectrum. Here are some examples of notes that have gotten polarities around -0.8: Note Polarity Anti-trans rhetoric has been amplified by some conservative Colorado lawmakers, including U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, who narrowly won re-election in Colorado's GOP-leaning 3rd Congressional District, which does not include Colorado Springs. https://coloradosun.com/2022/11/20/colorado-springs-club-q-lgbtq-trans/ -0.800 President Trump explicitly undermined American faith in election results in the months leading up to the 2020 election. https://www.npr.org/2021/02/08/965342252/timeline-what-trump-told-supporters-for-months-before-they-attacked Enforcing Twitter's Terms of Service is not election interference. -0.825 The 2020 election was conducted in a free and fair manner. https://www.npr.org/2021/12/23/1065277246/trump-big-lie-jan-6-election -0.818 Note that I am not cherry-picking here; these are literally the first three rows in the scored_notes.tsv spreadsheet generated by the algorithm when I ran it locally that have a polarity score (called coreNoteFactor1 in the spreadsheet) of less than -0.8. Now, here are some notes that have gotten polarities around +0.8. It turns out that many of these are either people talking about Brazilian politics in Portuguese or Tesla fans angrily refuting criticism of Tesla, so let me cherry-pick a bit to find a few that are not: Note Polarity As of 2021 data, 64% of \"Black or African American\" children lived in single-parent families. https://datacenter.aecf.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by-race-and-ethnicity +0.809 Contrary to Rolling Stones push to claim child trafficking is \"a Qanon adjacent conspiracy,\" child trafficking is a real and huge issue that this movie accurately depicts.

This suggests that if you apply this algorithm in other cultural contexts, it could automatically detect what their primary political divides are, and bridge across those too. Meanwhile, notes that get the highest helpfulness look like this. This time, because these notes are actually shown on Twitter, I can just screenshot one directly: And another one: The second one touches on highly partisan political themes more directly, but it's a clear, high-quality and informative note, and so it gets rated highly. So all in all, the algorithm seems to work, and the ability to verify the outputs of the algorithm by running the code seems to work. What do I think of the algorithm? The main thing that struck me when analyzing the algorithm is just how complex it is. There is the \"academic paper version\", a gradient descent which finds a best fit to a five-term vector and matrix equation, and then the real version, a complicated series of many different executions of the algorithm with lots of arbitrary coefficients along the way. Even the academic paper version hides complexity under the hood. The equation that it's optimizing is a degree-4 equation (as there's a degree-2 𝑓 𝑢 ∗ 𝑓 𝑛 term in the prediction formula, and compounding that the cost function measures error squared). While optimizing a degree-2 equation over any number of variables almost always has a unique solution, which you can calculate with fairly basic linear algebra, a degree-4 equation over many variables often has many solutions, and so multiple rounds of a gradient descent algorithm may well arrive at different answers. Tiny changes to the input may well cause the descent to flip from one local minimum to another, significantly changing the output. The distinction between this, and algorithms that I helped work on such as quadratic funding, feels to me like a distinction between an economist's algorithm and an engineer's algorithm. An economist's algorithm, at its best, values being simple, being reasonably easy to analyze, and having clear mathematical properties that show why it's optimal (or least-bad) for the task that it's trying to solve, and ideally proves bounds on how much damage someone can do by trying to exploit it. An engineer's algorithm, on the other hand, is a result of iterative trial and error, seeing what works and what doesn't in the engineer's operational context. Engineer's algorithms are pragmatic and do the job; economist's algorithms don't go totally crazy when confronted with the unexpected. Or, as was famously said on a related topic by the esteemed internet philosopher roon (aka tszzl): Of course, I would say that the \"theorycel aesthetic\" side of crypto is necessary precisely to distinguish protocols that are actually trustless from janky constructions that look fine and seem to work well but under the hood require trusting a few centralized actors - or worse, actually end up being outright scams. Deep learning works when it works, but it has inevitable vulnerabilities to all kinds of adversarial machine learning attacks. Nerd traps and sky-high abstraction ladders, if done well, can be quite robust against them. And so one question I have is: could we turn Community Notes itself into something that's more like an economist algorithm? To give a view of what this would mean in practice, let's explore an algorithm I came up with a few years ago for a similar purpose: pairwise-bounded quadratic funding. The goal of pairwise-bounded quadratic funding is to plug a hole in \"regular\" quadratic funding, where if even two participants collude with each other, they can each contribute a very high amount of money to a fake project that sends the money back to them, and get a large subsidy that drains the entire pool. In pairwise quadratic funding, we assign each pair of participants a limited budget 𝑀 . The algorithm walks over all possible pairs of participants, and if the algorithm decides to add a subsidy to some project 𝑃 because both participant 𝐴 and participant 𝐵 supported it, that subsidy comes out of the budget assigned to the pair ( 𝐴 , 𝐵 ) . Hence, even if 𝑘 participants were to collude, the amount they could steal from the mechanism is at most 𝑘 ∗ ( 𝑘 − 1 ) ∗ 𝑀 . An algorithm of exactly this form is not very applicable to the Community Notes context, because each user makes very few votes: on average, any two users would have exactly zero votes in common, and so the algorithm would learn nothing about users' polarities by just looking at each pair of users separately. The goal of the machine learning model is precisely to try to \"fill in\" the matrix from very sparse source data that cannot be analyzed in this way directly. But the challenge of this approach is that it takes extra effort to do it in a way that does not make the result highly volatile in the face of a few bad votes. Does Community Notes actually fight polarization? One thing that we could do is analyze whether or not the Community Notes algorithm, as is, actually manages to fight polarization at all - that is, whether or not it actually does any better than a naive voting algorithm. Naive voting algorithms already fight polarization to some limited extent: a post with 200 upvotes and 100 downvotes does worse than a post that just gets the 200 upvotes. But does Community Notes do better than that? Looking at the algorithm abstractly, it's hard to tell. Why wouldn't a high-average-rating but polarizing post get a strong polarity and a high helpfulness? The idea is that polarity is supposed to \"absorb\" the properties of a note that cause it to get a lot of votes if those votes are conflicting, but does it actually do that? To check this, I ran my own simplified implementation for 100 rounds. The average results were: Quality averages: Group 1 (good): 0.30032841807271166 Group 2 (good but extra polarizing): 0.21698871680927437 Group 3 (neutral): 0.09443120045416832 Group 4 (bad): -0.1521160965793673 In this test, \"Good\" notes received a rating of +2 from users in the same political tribe and +0 from users in the opposite political tribe, and \"Good but extra polarizing\" notes received a rating of +4 from same-tribe users and -2 from opposite-tribe users. Same average, but different polarity. And it seems to actually be the case that \"Good\" notes get a higher average helpfulness than \"Good but extra polarizing\" notes. One other benefit of having something closer to an \"economist's algorithm\" would be having a clearer story for how the algorithm is penalizing polarization. How useful is this all in high-stakes situations? We can see some of how this works out by looking at one specific situation. About a month ago, Ian Bremmer complained that a highly critical Community Note that was added to a tweet by a Chinese government official had been removed. The note, which is now no longer visible. Screenshot by Ian Bremmer. This is heavy stuff. It's one thing to do mechanism design in a nice sandbox Ethereum community environment where the largest complaint is $20,000 going to a polarizing Twitter influencer. It's another to do it for political and geopolitical questions that affect many millions of people and where everyone, often quite understandably, is assuming maximum bad faith. But if mechanism designers want to have a significant impact into the world, engaging with these high-stakes environments is ultimately necessary. In the case of Twitter, there is a clear reason why one might suspect centralized manipulation to be behind the Note's removal: Elon has a lot of business interests in China, and so there is a possibility that Elon forced the Community Notes team to interfere with the algorithm's outputs and delete this specific one. Fortunately, the algorithm is open source and verifiable, so we can actually look under the hood! Let's do that. The URL of the original tweet is https://twitter.com/MFA_China/status/1676157337109946369. The number at the end, 1676157337109946369, is the tweet ID. We can search for that in the downloadable data, and identify the specific row in the spreadsheet that has the above note: Here we get the ID of the note itself, 1676391378815709184. We then search for that in the scored_notes.tsv and note_status_history.tsv files generated by running the algorithm. We get: The second column in the first output is the note's current rating. The second output shows the note's history: its current status is in the seventh column (NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS), and the first status that's not NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS that it received earlier on is in the fifth column (CURRENTLY_RATED_HELPFUL). Hence, we see that the algorithm itself first showed the note, and then removed it once its rating dropped somewhat - seemingly no centralized intervention involved. We can see this another way by looking at the votes themselves. We can scan the ratings-00000.tsv file to isolate all the ratings for this note, and see how many rated HELPFUL vs NOT_HELPFUL: But if you sort them by timestamp, and look at the first 50 votes, you see 40 HELPFUL votes and 9 NOT_HELPFUL votes. And so we see the same conclusion: the note's initial audience viewed the note more favorably then the note's later audience, and so its rating started out higher and dropped lower over time. Unfortunately, the exact story of how the note changed status is complicated to explain: it's not a simple matter of \"before the rating was above 0.40, now it's below 0.40, so it got dropped\". Rather, the high volume of NOT_HELPFUL replies triggered one of the outlier conditions, increasing the helpfulness score that the note needs to stay over the threshold. This is a good learning opportunity for another lesson: making a credibly neutral algorithm truly credible requires keeping it simple. If a note moves from being accepted to not being accepted, there should be a simple and legible story as to why. Of course, there is a totally different way in which this vote could have been manipulated: brigading. Someone who sees a note that they disapprove of could call upon a highly engaged community (or worse, a mass of fake accounts) to rate it NOT_HELPFUL, and it may not require that many votes to drop the note from being seen as \"helpful\" to being seen as \"polarized\". Properly minimizing the vulnerability of this algorithm to such coordinated attacks will require a lot more analysis and work. One possible improvement would be not allowing any user to vote on any note, but instead using the \"For you\" algorithmic feed to randomly allocate notes to raters, and only allow raters to rate those notes that they have been allocated to. Is Community Notes not \"brave\" enough? The main criticism of Community Notes that I have seen is basically that it does not do enough. Two recent articles that I have seen make this point. Quoting one: The program is severely hampered by the fact that for a Community Note to be public, it has to be generally accepted by a consensus of people from all across the political spectrum. \"It has to have ideological consensus,\" he said. \"That means people on the left and people on the right have to agree that that note must be appended to that tweet.\" Essentially, it requires a \"cross-ideological agreement on truth, and in an increasingly partisan environment, achieving that consensus is almost impossible, he said. This is a difficult issue, but ultimately I come down on the side that it is better to let ten misinformative tweets go free than it is to have one tweet covered by a note that judges it unfairly. We have seen years of fact-checking that is brave, and does come from the perspective of \"well, actually we know the truth, and we know that one side lies much more often than the other\". And what happened as a result? Honestly, some pretty widespread distrust of fact-checking as a concept. One strategy here is to say: ignore the haters, remember that the fact checking experts really do know the facts better than any voting system, and stay the course. But going all-in on this approach seems risky. There is value in building cross-tribal institutions that are at least somewhat respected by everyone. As with William Blackstone's dictum and the courts, it feels to me that maintaining such respect requires a system that commits far more sins of omission than it does sins of commission. And so it seems valuable to me that there is at least one major organization that is taking this alternate path, and treating its rare cross-tribal respect as a resource to be cherished and built upon. Another reason why I think it is okay for Community Notes to be conservative is that I do not think it is the goal for every misinformative tweet, or even most misinformative tweets, to receive a corrective note. Even if less than one percent of misinformative tweets get a note providing context or correcting them, Community Notes is still providing an exceedingly valuable service as an educational tool. The goal is not to correct everything; rather, the goal is to remind people that multiple perspectives exist, that certain kinds of posts that look convincing and engaging in isolation are actually quite incorrect, and you, yes you, can often go do a basic internet search to verify that it's incorrect. Community Notes cannot be, and is not meant to be, a miracle cure that solves all problems in public epistemology. Whatever problems it does not solve, there is plenty of room for other mechanisms, whether newfangled gadgets such as prediction markets or good old-fashioned organizations hiring full-time staff with domain expertise, to try to fill in the gaps. Conclusions Community Notes, in addition to being a fascinating social media experiment, is also an instance of a fascinating new and emerging genre of mechanism design: mechanisms that intentionally try to identify polarization, and favor things that bridge across divides rather than perpetuate them. The two other things in this category that I know about are (i) pairwise quadratic funding, which is being used in Gitcoin Grants and (ii) Polis, a discussion tool that uses clustering algorithms to help communities identify statements that are commonly well-received across people who normally have different viewpoints. This area of mechanism design is valuable, and I hope that we can see a lot more academic work in this field. Algorithmic transparency of the type that Community Notes offers is not quite full-on decentralized social media - if you disagree with how Community Notes works, there's no way to go see a view of the same content with a different algorithm. But it's the closest that very-large-scale applications are going to get within the next couple of years, and we can see that it provides a lot of value already, both by preventing centralized manipulation and by ensuring that platforms that do not engage in such manipulation can get proper credit for doing so. I look forward to seeing both Community Notes, and hopefully many more algorithms of a similar spirit, develop and grow over the next decade.",

(vitalik.ca) 375 points by fbrusch 23 hours ago| hidepastfavorite199 comments ryukoposting 20 hours agoA very interesting article. It seems like the Community Notes system is built on (in my opinion) a very mathematically sound model. It seems far less susceptible to biased \"mob actions\" than a conventional upvote&#x2F;downvote system, even if it&#x27;s not impervious to such actions. \"Bias\" exists in the eye of the beholder, so it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect any content rating system to be perfectly unbiased.Community Notes and crypto share a common thread of \"complicated math that makes it both extremely powerful and totally opaque to 95% of people.\" Honestly, that&#x27;s a pretty weak relationship for how much page-space it got in the writeup. Looks like Vitalik is writing a crypto blog, so I guess you gotta appeal to your readers. Great read nonetheless. reply chrisco255 12 hours agoparentThe association with crypto wasn&#x27;t merely about the math aspect, but also the principles of open source verification of the algorithms and credible neutrality. reply major505 21 hours agoprevI really like community notes.

Once you are accepted, you can at first participate in rating existing notes, and once you&#x27;ve made enough good ratings *(measured by seeing which ratings match with the final outcome for that note)*, you can also write notes of your own.I think twitter is especially fortunate to have the audience diversity it has to make this work - there seems to be a good mix of both left and right wing leaning users. A consensus model with such diversity encourages compromise.I feel like the strength of using this model is that it&#x27;s low stakes - at the end of the day it&#x27;s a tweet. People are willing to make concessions, because it&#x27;s a tweet.

He could have easily killed the beta project as having failed or a leftover project from the people that used to be there. reply viraptor 10 hours agorootparentSure, he can get credit for not making a bad decision in this case and defaulting to a good outcome.

The default position should be not to change or intervene. In the case of a new product or feature that means not shipping the product unless it is tested along the way and continues to meet predefined targets. Anything less risks committing resources to a project that at best isn&#x27;t valuable and at worst is a net drain on the company.In this case, Twitter after Elon acquired it decided to continue with the beta feature. I have no idea how that decision was made internally and can&#x27;t peg it on Elon, though I can assume he had the authority to spike the project if he wanted to. Assuming Twitter has competent PMs, they made the active choise to move the project out of beta when the testing phase was complete and they evaluated whether it met goals. replymadeofpalk 20 hours agorootparentprevAlas, twitter is has never been like \"every single company\", and I presume it would have languished in it&#x27;s pre-musk state for many more years before it got cancelled. reply anigbrowl 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see any reason to think so.

As in, X needs the ability to ban users from X.It seems to me like community notes are a great way to push whatever reactionary narrative someone manages to cook up when they oppose the person tweeting &#x2F; the topic at hand. reply bowsamic 22 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a good way to push any \"status quo\" narrative. Community Notes present themselves as true, so naturally people don&#x27;t question the things that they link to. I&#x27;ve seen posts before where many incorrect Community Notes come and go on that same post.It is the standard internet psychology: someone says something that seems dubious or they are generally a dubious person, a \"sensible\" person or agency (Community Notes) comes along with a lot of popular support to offer a rebuttal, a vast majority then assume the latter is true without bothering to check.

Is there no public data on this we can use to prove it&#x27;s true, just trusting the org at it&#x27;s word? reply somenameforme 21 hours agoparentI think this is easy to explain by considering that the meaning of left&#x2F;right constantly changes over time. For example, how would you characterize somebody who is pro free speech, anti war, anti hegemony, pro equality of opportunity, in support of a color-blind society, and so on? 20 years ago that would have been an absolutely textbook liberal, today that is no longer the case.So when we say left or right we&#x27;re not really referring to any sort of static values, or even fundamental values. It all just keeps shifting and often in self-contradictory ways. So the terms just become a proxy for the ever-shifting divides in society. This makes it essentially a tautology that any fair sampling of society will end up divided on those terms. reply delecti 20 hours agorootparentThe changing of left&#x2F;right over time is largely because much of American society views politics through the lens of Democrat&#x2F;Republican. On a broader level, economic left&#x2F;right and authoritarian&#x2F;libertarian haven&#x27;t moved, but both parties kinda rotate around them over time. At the moment I&#x27;d say both democrats are moving slightly further left, and both parties are moving more authoritarian. reply myrmidon 22 hours agoparentprevTo me, it appears clear that the divide is not really left&#x2F;right; my understanding is that the algorithm basically reduces a high-dimensional \"alignment\" of a user&#x2F;note to a 1-dimensional \"polarity\", and this simply happens to somewhat coincide with the US party split.I think this is almost to be expected if you have a 2 party political system, because each party is trying to align with as many voters as possible; so you can fully expect that the republican&#x2F;democrat split is a \"good\" cut through alignment space.Basically, the algorithm explicitly looks for the \"best\" polarity axis (i.e. the one that contains the most information about whether a user is going to find something agreeable or not), while a 2 party political system implicitly alignes across such an axis (as an emergent property of party-politics-shifting). reply nvm0n2 21 hours agorootparent> this simply happens to somewhat coincide with the US party splitThat&#x27;s not my reading. The negative polarity is clearly the US Democrats, but as Vitalik notes, the opposite polarity isn&#x27;t anything obviously specific to the Republicans. His posts for negative were simply the first three posts and they&#x27;re all of a very consistent political ideology and region. But he had to cherry-pick posts for positive polarity to try and sustain the claim that this is the opposite of the negative polarity, as Brazilian politics and Tesla people isn&#x27;t something anyone would have picked if asked to guess what the posts would be about ahead of time.Then there&#x27;s the clear content differences between the positive vs negative polarity posts. The negative polarity posts are all highly subjective opinions, usually about the tone of what some famous people said. Their references are simply left-leaning US media articles which are themselves opinion. They could be easily disputed and frequently are. The positive polarity posts are cherry picked for the purpose of making a point, yet are mostly specific factual claims with hard data and references, except for the second, which is apparently disputing the claim that child trafficking doesn&#x27;t even exist? I don&#x27;t see any way to dispute any of the claims in the positive polarity notes. You&#x27;d have to fall back on \"well that may be true but in wider context...\" type responses.So it&#x27;s not really clear exactly what this algorithm is picking up on. The differences may just reflect the inherent nature of politics in which left and right are often presented as polar opposites, but which in reality is more like the left being relatively homogenous and consistent at any given point in time, whereas the \"right\" is more like a coalition of people who aren&#x27;t on the left than a specific set of policy or cultural concerns. reply pessimizer 21 hours agorootparent> which is apparently disputing the claim that child trafficking doesn&#x27;t even exist?The troublesome part of that note is that \"the movie accurately depicts\" the issue. The following note has \"these books are obscene.\" The first is a little bit different in that it is straightforward and factual, but with the (missing) context of the tweet it was probably thought to be an irrelevant insult i.e. I bet the tweet wasn&#x27;t about the proportion of black children in single-parent households.It&#x27;s obviously a party split in a way, but to my eyes it isn&#x27;t about assigning people to a party - it&#x27;s finding people who hate current parties rather than people who love them. That is to say: polarized individuals. I think it&#x27;s an accident of history that people who despise Republicans currently have their opinions fairly well-represented by the Democratic Party, but on the other side, people who hate Democrats aren&#x27;t very well represented by the Republican Party. The Democrat-hating base is unruly, and I think it contains far more people who also dislike or are neutral toward Republican politics and politicians. reply nvm0n2 21 hours agorootparentThat could be. It&#x27;s not clear from the note what movie is being referred to. The lack of context makes it harder to interpret.The last post reflects ideological values, but appears to be a factually unambiguous claim about US law. The images show cartoons of men sucking each other&#x27;s dicks. In law \"obscene\" is used to mean something like \"overtly sexual\", which at least the first book clearly meets. reply enragedcacti 17 hours agorootparentObscene in the context of the first amendment protections is defined by the Miller test regardless of how any laws define obscenity. The third prong alone is a high bar to clear in this case and its what makes the claim far from factually unambiguous imo.> Whether a reasonable person finds that the matter, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. reply nvm0n2 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s meant to be an educational text, no? It doesn&#x27;t seem to fit any of those categories. reply enragedcacti 15 hours agorootparentThey are not categories, they are contexts, and educational texts can have value within any or all of those contexts. In fact being educational or informative could inherently be considered to be of literary value.Many people rightfully complain about the lack of specificity and clarity in the third prong, but that is even more evidence for why it is a bad community note because there is obvious room for interpretation and the note leaves none. Thus, even if you agree with its conclusion, it lacks sufficient context which is one of the voting criteria. reply pessimizer 20 hours agorootparentprevNo, obscene doesn&#x27;t mean that. Obscene material is illegal material, not adults-only material.edit: so saying that the books depicted explicit sexual acts would be indisputable, but the determination that the books were obscene would happen in court. And if drawings of two people sucking each other&#x27;s dicks were judged obscene, a lot of things would instantly become illegal in that jurisdiction. reply nvm0n2 20 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a circular definition (the law is defining what&#x27;s illegal, so the category it defines cannot itself be defined as that which is illegal). Though the actual legal definition in the USA isn&#x27;t much better.I think the claim in question is about the first amendment issue. If the material was judged obscene then it could still be allowed, or disallowed, or disallowed in some contexts (i.e. schools, what&#x27;s in dispute here) but such laws wouldn&#x27;t get tripped up by the bill of rights. reply pessimizer 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a circular definition. \"Obscene\" is a term used for content that has been deemed illegal. It is not a general term for sexual content. It is not a term for content that is illegal sometimes but not other times. It is not a euphemism for material that is restricted to adult consumption, or for explicit pornography.more charitably, but still repetitious: when one says that something is obscene, that&#x27;s saying that it should be illegal in any context; that it has no value. A drawing of two people sucking each others dicks has surely met that bar in the past - information about birth control has met that bar in the past. But I do not think the suggestion was that drawings of gay men having sex should be illegal, what was being suggested was that it is not appropriate for children. That&#x27;s not a question of obscenity. replymyrmidon 18 hours agorootparentprev> That&#x27;s not my reading.I&#x27;m not sure where you actually disagree with me.I&#x27;d be very careful though about drawing conclusions about what exactly polarity means here because 3 examples are not nearly enough-- especially for conclusions like which polarity is more \"fact based\".My viewpoint is that the polarity in the algorithm should be akin to a principal component in alignment space (because of how the algorithm works), and you would expect the political parties to be split along a very similar axis in a 2 party system (an emergent property-- if they were not, one party could gain voters or improve cohesiveness of its voter pool by shifting its alignment). reply nvm0n2 17 hours agorootparentI think on re-reading, I&#x27;m not strongly disagreeing with you indeed. I think it&#x27;s just that the article says the positive polarity posts don&#x27;t map cleanly to Republicans, whereas the negative polarity posts do map cleanly to the Democrats, so how much does it really coincide? reply pjc50 21 hours agoparentprevNot a direct answer, but years ago a friend of mine tried a similar experiment by taking a bunch of polarizing questions and then doing principal component analysis on the results. He came up with two axes (the maths would spit out a number of axes, but the rest were low-salience). The top one was very similar to \"left&#x2F;right\".http:&#x2F;&#x2F;politics.beasts.org&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;eigenvectorsIt would be interesting to repeat this today, either with the same or different questions. reply jl6 22 hours agoparentprevNot sure about proof, but the left&#x2F;right dichotomy also “emerged” in the real world in most countries. It’s not the only axis of variation that we see, but it’s a dominant one. Since Twitter is part of the real world, the users may have arrived with a pre-existing propensity to group themselves into left&#x2F;right tribes, and then the mechanics of social media bubble formation accelerated the polarization process. reply phatfish 22 hours agorootparentOnce a \"tribe\" gets big enough it starts to force others to pick a side. Inevitably the system reduces down to two.In politics voting methods can defuse this somewhat by allowing the smaller tribes stick to their own values and not loose out too heavily in the power grab. First-past-the-post amplifies the larger tribes, proportional representation (or similar systems) can partially reduce their effect. reply gostsamo 22 hours agorootparentprevleft&#x2F;right appears only where nothing else is allowed. in the countries where the rule is not \"winner takes it all\" there is a spectrum. reply pjc50 21 hours agorootparentBut the spectrum still ends up being \"left&#x2F;right\", with some subdivisions over \"red vs green\" lefties. reply gostsamo 21 hours agorootparentNo, not really.

In many cases on social media discourse, it comes down to pro-establishment vs. anti-establishment (which previously would usually have been seen as right vs. left but now is generally seen as the reverse).Anecdotally, most community notes I&#x27;ve seen appear to take the form of \"anti-establishment claim -> community note refuting the anti-establishment claim\".

He&#x27;s been writing about crypto for 10+ years. If he wants to draw attention to community notes on his blog, he&#x27;s probably primarily doing it just for the fun of thinking and writing, but as a nice side effect, I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t mind if devs in crypto took inspiration from community notes, particularly when it comes to building crypto-native social networks. reply m3kw9 20 hours agoparentprevI’m assuming the dead ox is crypto reply petesergeant 21 hours agoparentprevSure, I had the same thought, but after the initial comparison he mostly stops talking about crypto and examines the topic properly, so worth reading the rest of the article. reply snowwrestler 22 hours agoprevIt seems like an entire generation has grown up believing that vote features on the Internet exist to improve quality, because that&#x27;s what they were told by the websites who marketed those features.Members of a prior generation may remember that voting features were introduced explicitly to improve engagement, not quality.

Hence why most people will listen to specialists doing work on their home, or their accountant when receiving tax advice. It&#x27;s not controversial and doesn&#x27;t differ by political stance. In this case Vitalik is clearly qualified to read, understand and explain ML Python; he is agreed upon by all to genuinely have expertise (relative to the average layman at least).The reason that expertise has become so controversial nowadays is due to the left&#x27;s habit of automatically labelling any academic or civil servant an expert, and continuing to insist on the unquestionable nature of their expertise even after widely publicized and very basic failures. To other people expertise is something you have to prove via unambiguous and exceptional results, not merely assert via title, and the public sector&#x27;s general lack of quantifiably positive results makes academic expertise frequently subject to dispute. reply chrisco255 12 hours agoparentprev> It should be noted that he is less sanguine about letting misinformation run free when he is complaining about inaccurate press coverage of cryptocurrency.

It&#x27;s pretentious to believe that such a thing is desirable or could ever be neutral. Such a system is ALWAYS capturable and corruptible. So of course it&#x27;s risky. That&#x27;s why free speech being a social and cultural value is as important as it being a law for governments to respect. Meaningless is the law if a culture is too prudish or too conforming to begin with.If Vitalik wishes to persuade people away from bad opinions about crypto, doing so at his leisure on his own micro-blog or regular blog is certainly a preferable option to acting as some sort of Minister of Truth. reply meowface 21 hours agoparentprev>Members of a prior generation may remember that voting features were introduced explicitly to improve engagement, not quality.

Given you can engage by either voting or replying, I feel like voting is much more about molding and curation than engagement. Replying is a much stronger form of engagement: people can see that it is you specifically who engaged, and you can express your opinion more fully.I agree that \"quality\" is subjective and so isn&#x27;t the right concept, but it&#x27;s about a community shaping a platform&#x27;s content based on the average of their preferences and therefore making it more likely any of them will want to continue using the community in the future. It of course doesn&#x27;t necessarily optimize for truth, but it optimizes for the feedback loop of a site&#x27;s users turning the site into what they want to see and being more likely to use (and vote on) the site more actively as a result.

Some of the reasons for these are:- self-interest - intentionally since it protects their interests - accidental since they&#x27;ve spent so much time they need it to be meaningful - accidental since they want to please their fellow experts - intentionally since they want to go with the herd- selection bias towards being someone who cares about this very much goes with lack of aptitude- historical bias - most people are better equipped than experts to spot paradigm shifts because experts are over-indexed on the status quo- no field expertiseUltimately, it&#x27;s up to you how you weight people&#x27;s opinion, and may each person&#x27;s epistemology serve them appropriately. reply xvector 19 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, the uneducated and uninformed tend to hold the strongest opinions. reply tyre 22 hours agorootparentprev\"Reality has a well-known liberal bias.\" reply blfr 18 hours agorootparentUsually until someone bothers to check.Like the field of psychology which surprisingly often produces results about very successful liberal-endorsed interventions (head start programs or growth mindset) that reliably return weaker results as they&#x27;re tested more and finally stop reproducing altogether. These, sometimes massive, failures do impressively little to tame the smugness of their proponents. reply ruszki 17 hours agorootparentYou’ve just described the scientific method. That’s how it is intended, and that’s currently the best way to make decisions according to our knowledge. Failure is completely normal. reply blfr 16 hours agorootparentFirst, shoddy research getting published because it matches authors&#x27; and reviewers&#x27; bias is not some immanent part of the scientific method.Second, that is not what the comment was about. It was about repeated debunking of reality&#x27;s supposed liberal bias from which its fans consistently refuse to learn. replypessimizer 21 hours agoparentprevIt reminds me more of democracy, where anyone can be a candidate and anyone can vote on a candidate. reply enumjorge 21 hours agorootparentWith the last couple of election cycles in the US really emphasizing the “anyone” aspect. reply phpisthebest 21 hours agorootparentprevMany&#x2F;most People only support democracy when t is perceived their \"team\" is the one that controls said \"democracy\" reply lucideer 22 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s great to see a deep analysis like this.Recently Community Notes has been opened up to a significant enough % of the Twitter populous that you&#x27;re starting to see a very large quantity of \"spurious\" notes (argumentative &#x2F; sarcastic responses that aren&#x27;t addressing facts - more appropriate as actual replies), with even one or two examples of such notes being approved, in many cases I&#x27;d guess because approvers found them entertaining rather than useful. That&#x27;s lead to criticisms of CN as something \"in decline\".I hope that&#x27;s not the case - spurious notes don&#x27;t actually do any harm (and are often very entertaining), but dismissal of CN as a system would: loss of reputation would mean a dilution of the impact of fact checks & context provision on rebutting misinformation.Another possible concern is, while it seems obvious to most that CN isn&#x27;t a feature that would have been conceived under Musk, and it&#x27;s interesting to see it continue to thrive now, one wonders how long it will be tolerated (the example from the first screenshot in this article is telling). In possibly related news, Musk has recently shown an interest in influencing elections[0] in Ireland (Twitter EU HQ) in direct response to talks of EU \"misinformation regulation\".[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1695545217133490453 (Gript Media is a far-right publication based in Ireland) reply nvm0n2 21 hours agoparent> while it seems obvious to most that CN isn&#x27;t a feature that would have been conceived under MuskThis isn&#x27;t obvious at all. A big part of why Musk got upset with Twitter under its previous management was his dislike of centralized journalist-driven fact checking. He might not have come up with the algorithm but you can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s living on borrowed time whilst simultaneously criticizing it for scaling up too fast. reply xigoi 21 hours agoprevSo if I understand correctly, Community Notes are a feature that allows you to add notes on others&#x27; posts and vote on them? How is that different from comments? reply pjc50 21 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s explained in the article, but the voting system is much more complicated and attempts to converge on ideologically neutral results. Whereas the voting on twitter replies is limited to likes and downvotes, with no clear connection to how high that appears in the results. reply bowsamic 22 hours agoprevCommunity Notes seems to be increasing in usage as X becomes more toxic and full of conspiracy theorists. I personally think there is a causation here. The frequency at which damaging content appeared on my timeline (just a few days ago I de-activated my account) has ballooned within the last few months. It got to the point where it was constantly serving me videos of fights or even quite often animal torture. There is also an uptick in hate, e.g. overt racism, accounts that have a lot of followers and openly ask for ethnic cleansing against non-whites, etc. Elon has turned X into \"anything\" (though, I know more left wing people who are still getting suspended, esp. if they criticise Musk), and Community Notes has become a \"release valve\" allowing the old liberal twitter to regulate posts on X and prevent the entire platform from becoming the next 8chan.If Community Notes are maintained at their current pace, there is the potential for X to continue on a kind of life support for the majority of \"normal\" people. If Elon starts to limit Community Notes, e.g. if they start being used on his posts too much, then I think that X will surely die. X already smelled bad before Elon bought it, and its stench is intensifying. What was once a nice information platform with subcultures of toxicity and hate, is now perceived as a place where one cannot escape the worst parts of modern internet culture. Community Notes is the only thing stopping it from collapsing into fanatic esotericism. reply tomcam 22 hours agoparentAnimal torture? I get tons of hilarious animal shorts on Twitter but never animal torture. I train the algo by liking these vids. I do get fight, real estate, web design, shuffle dance, and guitar vids for the same reason. Could you perhaps be feeding the algorithm? Why would you get more than one or two after downvoting?

Brendan Falk I am thrilled to announce that the Fig team will be joining Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Amazon has acquired Fig's technology! Fig and AWS share a passion for improved developer tools and services. By combining Fig's expertise with AWS' long-term orientation and track record of delivering customer-centric products, we see an opportunity to enhance the developer experience. AWS believes that generative AI represents a major technological shift to transform the way its customers build, and we are beyond excited to be a part of that larger vision. What's happening to Fig's product? Existing users will continue to be able to use Fig and will receive ongoing support. What's more, we are now making all the paid Fig Team features completely free. New users will not be able to sign up for Fig's products right now while we focus on optimizing them for existing customers and addressing some needs identified to integrate Fig with AWS. If you're interested in staying up-to-date on our work with AWS, we will release a signup link in the coming weeks! What products will Amazon + Fig be offering? There aren't any updates to share at this time on future plans, but we continue to stay hard at work innovating on behalf of developers, specifically in the terminal/shell. We will keep you posted here as there are more updates to share. Thanks! As always, we are incredibly thankful to our community for its continued support. With hundreds of thousands of users, 22k GitHub stars, 13k Discord members, 400 open source contributors, and 5 core products, we could not be more proud of what you have helped us accomplish over the last 3 years.

It is almost entirely just lies. And the same ones every time.Just tell us if you just wanted the employees, just wanted some rights, wanted to integrate their product for your use, or just wanted to kill something off. I&#x27;m sick of reading the same new release for every acquisition knowing it&#x27;s bullshit. reply TimJRobinson 9 hours agorootparentprevI was at Cloud9 which was acquired by Amazon. We took most of the existing frontend and tech and rebuilt the backend on AWS, then relaunched it as AWS Cloud9. In the meantime we sunset the existing service.I&#x27;d assume the same thing is going to happen here. reply scosman 14 hours agorootparentprevI read it as “hosted AWS version coming soon, we will email you when it’s time to migrate”.If it was just acquihire there probably wouldn’t have a big blog post tying it to AWS.

Existing customers are worth $x&#x2F;yr. New customers with the new product are worth $y&#x2F;yr. Finance doesn&#x27;t want $x competing with $y. Something something financial models making the deal worth what they paid, so closing registration is simply part of the deal that was signed. reply jonathankoren 7 hours agorootparentprevThe blog post doesn&#x27;t mean anything. HN is full of congratulatory posts of acquihires. They&#x27;re all the same. \"Now that we&#x27;re part of $BIGCO we&#x27;ll be working to integrate our technology into $BIGCO.\"It never happens.If $BIGCO had any intent to keep the product along, you&#x27;d be reading the post on $BIGCO&#x27;s blog, not $FAILEDSTARTUP&#x27;s blog. reply derefr 10 hours agorootparentprev> If AWS bought it for the product, what reason would there ever be to stop the current business model entirely rather than leaving it on its current trajectory for a few months, untill said \"needs\" are addressed?That’s an easy one: if it’s burning money like crazy on its current hosting, but only because of rents extracted by one of their competitors, not for any inherent OpEx-intensity; and that therefore Amazon expects it to be profitable when moved to live rent-free on their hosting. reply keyle 10 hours agorootparentprevDo you know of any product that was acquihire and wasn&#x27;t decimated? reply danpalmer 1 hour agorootparentI think there’s the definition of acquihire. reply jtj606 6 hours agorootparentprevGitHub? reply rfrey 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think anyone believed the GitHub acquisition was just an aquihire. reply theolivenbaum 15 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of Slapdash&#x27;s and Command-E acquisitions.

It looked amazing, but wasn&#x27;t keen on fig getting every one of my inputs reply jozzas 3 hours agorootparentIt actually makes sense for Amazon integrating this with the whole browser based shell thing (which is a sensible secure default for a lot of people).Having something with autocomplete that works seamlessly with their services seems like a better idea than a plain prompt if you&#x27;re going to use their shell. Hopefully they do something sensible and customer-centric with the telemetry stuff, that seemed to be the big drawback for many. reply ryneandal 15 hours agoparentprevYeah, that is my expectation about its future as well. I really enjoyed using Fig for clear CLI introspection for many of my common workflows.I am fully expecting that I&#x27;ll have to go back to zsh-autosuggestions once the current iteration is fully wound down. reply giancarlostoro 8 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t Fig open source? Now&#x27;d be the time for people to fork it while there&#x27;s still the opportunity to do so if they find genuine value in the project.My favorite &#x27;acquihire&#x27; story is when Oracle bought out MySQL and the creator forked it and made MariaDB. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentnext [–]when Oracle bought out MySQL and the creator forked it and made MariaDBNot quite.Wiki tells me: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MySQL#HistorySun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB (the company) in 2008.Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010.

Killing new registrations, eventually forcing existing users to migrate to AWS, for a worse product as a service. reply api 14 hours agoparentprevI would never use a cloud-syncing cloud-connected terminal for simple security and privacy reasons alone, not to mention the fact that if it goes down I become basically disabled as a developer or admin.Several companies have tried to SaaSify the terminal and failed, so I suspect I am not alone here.\"We&#x27;ve noticed that there&#x27;s a component of the computing infrastructure that isn&#x27;t sending everything you do to the cloud and charging monthly rent...\" reply politelemon 13 hours agorootparentYes I&#x27;m genuinely shocked at the other comments here saying they use this happily; it should be a cause for concern. That it&#x27;s now landing in Amazon&#x27;s lap, doubly so. reply nojito 11 hours agorootparent> All cloud features are opt-in and your data is encrypted at rest. For autocomplete, all of your keystrokes are processed locally and never leave your device.Fig is a great product. reply hot_gril 12 hours agorootparentprevIf Fig goes down, you fall back to the regular shell that doesn&#x27;t have autocomplete etc. If Fig gets hacked, that&#x27;s scary, then again GitHub and others are similarly big targets.Idk though, this doesn&#x27;t seem useful enough to me as an individual that I&#x27;d bother looking into it. Maybe for a team or company. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentprevAs a side note, if your security relies on you typing things into your terminal, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. AWS even makes you check a box when generating creds that basically says \"I understand the way I&#x27;m doing this is insecure\" when generating creds that will be used that way. reply projectileboy 7 hours agoparentprevAcquisitions are usually great for the shareholders, and usually bad for the employees and the customers. reply bjt 6 hours agorootparentAt a startup, the employees are also shareholders. reply masto 16 hours agoprevThese features are nice, but I&#x27;ve never liked the idea of having to use a whole new terminal application to get them.I may be becoming a dinosaur, but it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not willing to try new things. On the contrary, after many years of being rigid about having one true development environment, I&#x27;ve moved away from Emacs to VS Code, and work from more heterogeneous environments instead of being 100% Mac. So these platform-specific thick client apps no longer feel like the way to go. reply hot_gril 12 hours agoparentSticking to Vim and other very well-established CLIs is partially what enabled flexibility for me. As long as I have access to a *nix machine locally or over SSH, I have a capable dev setup that I&#x27;m well-versed in. Same thing for the past 8 jobs I&#x27;ve bounced around in, whether in-office or remote, with whatever security restrictions, with or without a desk, maybe with just a 13\" laptop. It&#x27;s the lowest common denominator. Meanwhile my teammates at my current job are constantly trying to protect their workstation setups so they can use their IDEs locally, and they&#x27;ve also been forced to switch IDEs twice in the past couple of years.And this isn&#x27;t coming from some FOSS ideology. I don&#x27;t personally care about any of that, but the best tools are sometimes FOSS. I&#x27;ve got a Mac and can deal with Linux as needed. reply veg 16 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s no need for a new terminal. Their homepage literally says \"IDE-style autocomplete for your existing terminal\". reply hot_gril 16 hours agorootparentI also thought the wrong thing at first since the big front and center title on the homepage says \"The next-generation command line.\" reply rollcat 15 hours agoparentprevTo be honest I do think it&#x27;s time we move on from emulating teletypes, but I also believe that whatever comes next has to be an open standard, with competing implementations.There&#x27;s a whole graveyard out there of \"next-gen\" terminal projects, and none of those still alive seems to be gaining dominance. I don&#x27;t think writing down a spec would help this, but it would be great if whatever emerged victorious had one. reply askew 15 hours agoparentprevYou may be thinking of Warp (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.warp.dev&#x2F;) reply oxalorg 12 hours agoparentprevCurious to learn more about your switch from Emacs to VSCode?I&#x27;m a super confused soul, and currently I use all of them:- Emacs (for clojure &#x2F; lisps &#x2F; big projects).- NeoVim (for when I want to work in the shell, smaller scripts&#x2F;playground, ssh).- VScode (js &#x2F; ts &#x2F; frontend &#x2F; figma &#x2F; etc).I&#x27;ve made both my vim and emacs keybindings &#x2F; features almost identical, so there is limited context switching there.I feel very slow in VSCode, I don&#x27;t even have one of my most common task optimised in VSCode yet: grepping something and quickly moving to that buffer. reply chrysoprace 10 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not a different terminal application, but an overlay that gives you autocomplete-style suggestions in your existing terminal emulator. I don&#x27;t know all the terminal emulators it works with since it&#x27;s MacOS only, but it works in both iTerm2 and the VSCode terminal, granted that you&#x27;re not using a terminal multiplexer like tmux (which makes it useless for my workflow). reply dangus 9 hours agoparentprevI think the part of this that feels wrong is that it steps into the realm of so many other perfectly good tools, and it seems like it’s there to enshrine crappy local development and deployment practices.If you need reporting on the scripts your developers are running on their local machines, that probably means they have too much access to live environments. Guardrails and reporting should be in your CI&#x2F;CD process and your source control.Shells like fish or shell plug-ins already handle autocomplete nicely, so that feature isn’t that useful.If you need env&#x2F;dotfile management you probably need to spend time making a proper development environment rather than shimmying in a tool to make doing the wrong thing easier.SSH key management is so trivially accomplished by numerous methods like configuration management or built-in solutions offered by cloud providers. Plus, most development teams almost certainly give out too much SSH access as it stands.If you need to SSH regularly that means your application isn’t shipping logs and your local development tooling isn’t good enough. reply yieldcrv 9 hours agoparentprevYeah I just stopped paying for Jetbrains to move 100% to VS Code just a few months agoI was using both before but the upcoming annual payment reminded me that its over reply Brajeshwar 17 hours agoprevThat was fast.

In the last 6 weeks, 57 new contributors took the time to create 62 issues and 111 new contributors took the time to comment. These are very heathy community metrics, but there hasn&#x27;t been a lot of code activity, which would make sense if they were focused on the sale to AWS.Source for my insights from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devboard.gitsense.com&#x2F;withfigFull Disclosure: This is my tool reply acka 13 hours agorootparentAFAICT the core of Fig isn&#x27;t open source.

Surprised that it made into a viable product and shocked it actually got acquired. reply e-clinton 9 hours agoparentSame experience.

After acquisition the company product is much less likely to be shut down in the long run (unless it’s Google). reply miah_ 16 hours agorootparentNo, after acquisition usually the existing product is usually shutdown or phased out while its features are absorbed into some .With Google, everything has a huge chance of being shutdown, unless its Gmail or Search, but in both of those cases they will also continue to get worse over time. reply hot_gril 16 hours agorootparentor at least become more annoyingly entangled with stuff, like Minecraft + Microsoft reply jsnell 16 hours agorootparentprevDays since AWS last announced they were killing a devtool service: 4(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37254198) reply candiddevmike 16 hours agorootparentprevThe blog post reads like an acqui-hire, which almost always means the product gets shut down or open sourced and left for dead. reply merryje 16 hours agorootparentprev> Existing users will continue to be able to use Fig and will receive ongoing support.

This is of course possible, but still hard, and not clear if it&#x27;s the right place to spend energy.

I use the tool personally but really for largely basic things.The dropdown for autocomplete is far from necessary but a nice addition. Helping with completing commands that I don&#x27;t use often but know the basics of like \"aws s3 cp\" is nice. But because of that I could just never justify spending money on it.Hopefully it isn&#x27;t abandoned, but maybe this will also mean they don&#x27;t have to try to find artificial reasons (or bloat) to convince people to pay and can just focus on the core offering. reply mullingitover 17 hours agoprevSeems like tough competition in this space.

The scope of the combined project expanded beyond tracing to cover all of observability. OTEL's mission is to help organizations deliver high-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry. Four years later, OTEL is making good on its promise. It has to date provided a stable standard for the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, and traces), a collector that can receive, process, and export telemetry in any environment, and SDKs to instrument code in all major languages. It has also continued to expand its scope and introduced additional standards around semantic conventions and agent management. Today, OTEL is the second most active project in the CNCF, behind only Kubernetes in popularity. Its contributors are spread across all major observability vendors and its protocol has near-universal adoption among observability providers. In this post, we'll go over where OTEL is today, provide a summary of the various projects that fall under its domain, and talk about where it's going next. POLL Do you use OpenTelemetry in your organization? Yes No We're thinking about it What's open telemetry? 2 DAYS REMAINING OTEL - What's in a name? OTEL consists mainly of two types of projects: specifications and implementations. Specifications are the foundation of OTEL. They describe how telemetry should be captured, collected, processed, and exported. Specifications tend to be vendor-focused as they define the common standard that vendors have to implement to be compatible with OTEL. Implementations are the specific client libraries and tooling that are used to handle telemetry data. Implementations tend to be end-user-focused as they consist of the parts that end-users use to instrument their code. A project's stability is typically marked on a signal-by-signal basis. Each signal is a specific type of telemetry data - in OTEL, this means metrics, logs, and traces. OTEL today consists of the following sub-projects: OpenTelemetry Specification (specification) OpenTelemetry SDKs (implementation) OpenTelemetry Protocol (specification) OpenTelemetry Collector (implementation) Open Agent Management Protocol (specification) OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (specification) OpenTelemetry Specification (1.24.0) The Open Telemetry specification is the foundation of OTEL - it provides the APIs, SDKs, and data models that all other OTEL standards are derived from. A brief timeline of its development: 2020-09: Tracing marked stable 2021-11: Metrics marked stable 2023-04: Logs marked stable In terms of maturity, the OTEL spec is now stable for all signals. Because the logging signal was not deemed stable until earlier this year, many OTEL SDKs still do not support logging at this time. OpenTelemetry SDKs (Mixed) The OTEL SDKs provide client-side instrumentation based on the OTEL spec. For each language-specific SDK, there is a separate maturity level for each signal. Current maturity of each SDK. Auto Instrumentation Depending on the programming language, some SDKs also support automatic instrumentation. This is when the SDK automatically injects signals, mainly traces, into your application without needing to manually instrument code. Auto instrumentation doesn't work for compiled languages like go and rust. That said, you can still get automatic trace injection by going outside of the SDK and using eBPF and/or service mesh based tooling. OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP - 1.0) OTLP describes a common wire protocol for delivering observability data. There are two blessed transports in OTLP: http with protocol buffers and gRPC. This spec is considered stable and can be implemented on any service that receives, processes, or exports OTEL data. The spec is implemented by the OpenTelemetry collector and also by agents of observability vendors like Grafana and Datadog. OpenTelemetry Collector (0.83.0) The OTEL collector is a vendor-agnostic agent that collects, transforms, and sends observability data. The collector consists of the following components: receivers: push/pull data from different sources processors: transform/filter/enrich/derive data in flight exporters: send data to downstream destinations connectors: connectors are both a receiver and exporter and enable multiple pipelines to be stitched together pipelines: a chain of receiver, zero or more processors, and exporters extensions: components that provide additional capabilities outside of handling telemetry data (eg. basic auth, health checks, etc) Together, the various components act as an observability pipeline, allowing you to collect telemetry data from any source, process it in flight, and send it to any destination. The OTEL collector consists of two projects, otel-collector and otel-collector-contrib. otel-collector contains only the core components of the collector, chiefly logic strictly related to processing OLTP data. otel-collector-contrib is a kitchen sink of every integration you can imagine, with exporters and receivers for most observability providers present. At the time of this writing, this includes 91 receivers, 48 exporters, and 24 processors. End users are advised to use the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder to create a custom build of otel-collector-contrib with only components that they need. In addition to otel-collector-contrib, vendors like AWS and Splunk provide their own custom distributions of OTEL. Open Agent Management Protocol (OpAMP - Beta) OpAMP is a network protocol for the remote management of agents. This is a recent addition to OTEL, introduced in 2022, and provides a vendor-agnostic standard for controlling fleets of agents. These agents could be instances of the otel-collector or vendor-specific agents that implement OpAMP. With OpAMP, you can enable features like dynamic configuration deployments, agent updates, and credential management. There is currently a work-in-progress go implementation of the OpAMP spec. NOTE: If you're interested in managing OTEL agents via OpAMP - this is what my startup is working on. OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (1.21.0) The OTEL Semantic Conventions define a common set of attributes for observability data. They cover a wide range of areas including cloud resources, databases, exceptions, and systems. The semantic conventions are used by the OTEL SDKs and automatically applied for SDKs that support auto instrumentation. Common semantics enables the ability to correlate between different signals and is something I'm especially excited by, the reason for which can (and probably will) be the subject of an entire blog post. Etc OTEL is a massive project. While we covered the flagship projects, there are additional parts of OTEL that deserve a notable mention: OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL): a common transformation language for telemetry that is both performant and flexible - currently designed and implemented in otel-collector-contrib OTEL Demo: A micro-service-based shopping site that demonstrates a majority of features and language SDKs of OTEL Final Thoughts OTEL started as a merger between competing tracing specifications and evolved to become an industry standard for observability. The last four years laid the groundwork for building a common foundation across vendors and tools. The next four will reveal the fruits of that labor.

It doesn&#x27;t know what the hell it is. Is it a semantic standard? Is a protocol? It is a facade? It is a library? What layer of abstraction does it provide? Answer: All of the above! All the things! All the layers!2. No one from OpenTelemetry has actually tried instrumenting a library. And if they have, they haven&#x27;t the first suggestion on how instrumenters should actually use metrics, traces, and logs. Do you write to all three? To one?

Some things they suggest aren&#x27;t actually possible with their SDKs.For example, you cannot define a histogram&#x27;s buckets near where you define the histogram. You have to give the global exporter (or w&#x2F;e the type is) a list of \"overrides\" that map each histogram name => their buckets.

Y&#x27;all are just have a much younger product, and have not had time to do all the polish and tiny tweaks. I&#x27;m also much more familiar with Datadog, and sometimes a learning curve feels like missing features.- I really like your new Logs & Traces Explorers. I spend a lot of time coming up with queries, and having a focused place for that is great. Especially since there&#x27;s now a way to quickly turn my query into an alert or a dashboard item.- You&#x27;ve also recently (6mo?) improved the autocomplete dramatically! This is awesome, and one of my annoyances with DatadogOther feedback, and honestly this is all very minor. I&#x27;d be perfectly happy if nothing ever changed.- where do I go see the metrics? There&#x27;s no \"Metrics\" tab the way there&#x27;s a \"Logs\" and \"Traces\" tab. A \"Metrics Explorer\" would be great.- when I add a new plot, having to start out with a blank slate is not great. Datadog defaults to a generic system.cpu query just to fill something in, I find this helpful.- when I have a plot in a dashboard and I see it is trending in the wrong direction, it would be nice to be able to create an alert directly from the chart rather than have to copy the query over.- the exceptions tab is very helpful, but I&#x27;ve only recently discovered the LOW_CARDINAL_EXCEPTION_GROUPING flag. It&#x27;d be super nice if the variable part of exceptions was automatically detected and they were grouped- once nice thing in DD is being able to preview a span from a log or logs from a span without opening a new page. Or previewing a span from the global page. Temporary popping this stuff up in a sidebar would be great.- I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way to view only root spans in the trace viewer.- This might be a problem with the spring boot instrumentation, but I can&#x27;t see how to figure out what kind of span it is. Is it a `http.request`, `db.query`, etc? reply serverlessmom 4 hours agorootparentOooooh this is great feedback. When I started using SigNoz I too was surprised that there was no metrics tab. I wonder what you’d expect to see after clicking it: a list of service names collecting metrics? Or some high-level system wide infra metrics? Let me know! reply _boffin_ 17 hours agoparentprevAre you making sure that you&#x27;re doing a sample rate, but send over all errors?At a former place, we were doing 5% of non-error traces. reply fastest963 16 hours agorootparentHow do you send all errors? The way tracing works, as I understand it, is that each microservice gets a trace header which indicates if it should sample and each microservice itself records traces. If microservice A calls microservice B and B returns successfully but then A ends up erroring, how can you retroactively tell B to record the trace that it already finished making and threw away? Or do you just accept incomplete traces when there are errors? reply sigwinch28 16 hours agorootparentYou can do head-based sampling and tail-based sampling.With head sampling, the first service in the request chain can make the decision about whether to trace, which can reduce tracing overhead on services further down.With tail-based sampling, the tracing backend can make a determination about whether to persist the trace after the trace has been collected. This has tracing overheads, but allows you to make decisions like “always keep errors”. reply phamilton 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentelemetry.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;sampling&#x2F; describes it as Head&#x2F;Tail sampling, but in practice with vendors I see it as Ingestion sampling and Index sampling. We send all our spans to be ingested, but have a sample rate on indexing. That allows us to override the sampling at index and force errors and other high value spans to always be indexed. reply fastest963 16 hours agorootparentMaybe the Go client doesn&#x27;t support that? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentelemetry.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;instrumentation&#x2F;go&#x2F;sampling&#x2F; reply phillipcarter 15 hours agorootparentIt does, but the docs aren&#x27;t clear on that yet. TraceIdRatioBased is the \"take X% of traces\" sampler that all SDKs support today. reply grogenaut 17 hours agorootparentprevCareful, we&#x27;ve had systems go down under increased load just emitting errors if they didn&#x27;t emit much in non error state reply _boffin_ 17 hours agorootparentCan you go into more detail about your comment, please. reply cwp 17 hours agorootparentNot the GP, but:Imagine you&#x27;re sampling successful traces at, say, 1%, but sending all error traces. If your error rate is low, maybe also 1%, your trace volume will be about 2% of your overall request volume.Then you push an update that introduces a bug and now all requests fail with an error, and all those traces get sampled. Your trace volume just increased 50x, and your infrastructure may not be prepared for that. reply grogenaut 9 hours agorootparentprevSorry been busy running around all day. Basically what&#x27;s happened for us on some very high transaction per second services is that we only log errors. Or Trace errors. And the service basically never has errors. So imagine a service that is getting 800,000 to 3 million request a second. And this is happily going along basically not logging or tracing anything. Then all the sudden a circuit opens on redis and for every single one of those requests that was meant to use that open circuit to redis you log or trace an error. You went from a system that is doing basically no logging or tracing to one that is logging or tracing at 800,000 to 3 million times a second. What actually happens is you open the circuit on redis because red is a little bit slow or you&#x27;re a little bit slow calling redis and now you&#x27;re logging or tracing 100,000 times a second instead of zero and that bit of logging makes the rest of the requests slow down and now you&#x27;re actually within a few seconds logging or tracing 3 million requests a second. You have now toppled your tracing system your logging system and the service that&#x27;s doing the work. Death spiral ensues. Now the systems that are calling this system starts slowing down and start tracing or logging more because they&#x27;re also only tracing or logging mainly on error. Or sadly you have a better code that assumes that the tracing are logging system is up always and that starts failing causing errors and you get into doing extra special death loop that can only be recovered from by only attempting to log or error during an outage like this and you must push to fix. All the scenarios have happened to me in production.In general you don&#x27;t want your system to do more work in a bad state. In fact as the AWS well architected guide say when you&#x27;re overloaded or you&#x27;re in a heavy air State you should be doing as little work as possible. So that you can recover reply Topgamer7 17 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;ve seen problems with memory usage on failure too. Python implementation sends data to the collector in a separate thread from the http server operations. But if these start failing, its configured for exponential backoff, so it can hold onto a lot of memory, and start causing issues with container memory limits. reply Longwelwind 17 hours agorootparentprevI think what they means is that if you provisioned your system to receive spans for 5% of non-error requests and a few error requests, if for some random act of god, all the requests yield an error, your span collector will suddenyl receive spans for all requests. reply CSDude 17 hours agorootparentprevNormally yes, but we do a lot of data collection and identifying what&#x27;s an error is usually hard because of partial errors. We also care about performance, per tenant and per resource with lots of dimensionality and sampling reduces that information for us. reply podoman 17 hours agoparentprevThe reality is that most people don&#x27;t want to manage their own Clickhouse store, and not all engineers can operate with SQL as efficiently as with code (me included). Nonetheless, this is pretty cool! reply hnarn 15 hours agorootparent> not all engineers can operate with SQL as efficiently as with codeI don’t mean for this to sound insulting but I honestly do not think this is an acceptable take to have as a developer.Not knowing SQL is like refusing to learn any language that has classes in it, simply because you don’t like it.I’ve heard stories of huge corporations failing product launches because some code was written to SELECT * from a database and filtering it in-app instead of doing the queries correctly, and what’s so fun with these types of issues is that they usually don’t appear until weeks later when the table has grown to a size where it becomes a problem.When you’re saying that you’d rather find the data in-app than in-database, you’re putting the work on an inferior party in the transaction simply because you can’t be bothered.The code will never* find the correct data faster than the database.* there may be exceptions, but they’re far enough between to still say “never”. reply xyzzy_plugh 15 hours agorootparentDropping down to SQL to write a really complex query is, in my professional experience, always a poor use of time. It&#x27;s far simpler to just write the dumb for-loops over your data, if you can access it.Of course not all engineers can operate with SQL as efficiently as code -- that&#x27;s the whole point. Otherwise why would we be writing code? Learning SQL intimately doesn&#x27;t change that fact. reply hnarn 13 hours agorootparent> Dropping down to SQL to write a really complex query is, in my professional experience, always a poor use of time.We’re not talking about Assembly here, “dropping down” to SQL is something that anyone should be expected to do as soon as you’re grabbing or modifying any data from a database in any scenario where performance or integrity matters. The errors you can see in situations like this are extremely complex and databases literally exist to solve them for us.Also, if we just completely disregard the performance for a second and focus on data security instead, how do you ensure sensitive data isn’t passed to the wrong party if you don’t care about what queries are being sent?I mean, it doesn’t matter if it’s not “in the end” displayed to an end user in the application you’re writing, or if its not stored in the intermediary node where your code is running, that data is now unnecessarily on the wire in a situation where it never should have been in the first place. If you end up mixing one customers data with another’s and sending all of it in such a way that it could even theoretically be accessed by a third party, that’s a lawsuit waiting to happen regardless of whether it was “displayed” or “forwarded” or not.Imagine if you sniffed the packets going to some logistics app you use on your phone and you saw meta-data for all packages in your zip code in the response, or if some widget showing you your carbon footprint actually was based on a response containing the carbon footprint of every customer in the database. Even if it’s just [user_id,co2] it’s still completely unacceptable.Never mind scenarios where you’re modifying, adding or deleting data, those are even worse and no explanation should be necessary for why. reply ako 4 hours agorootparentprevSQL is definitely worth learning.

Hell, just serialize and unserialize a JSON document on every run if it&#x27;s small and infrequent enough ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯If you&#x27;ve got a successful data hungry web service with a reasonably normalized schema and moderately complex access patterns though, you&#x27;re not going to be looping over the whole thing on every page load. reply qaq 14 hours agorootparentprevDid your for loop solution include concurrent access by multiple clients? I highly doubt \"engineers can not operate with SQL as efficiently as code\" can implement anything even remotely as robust as what SQL DBMS offer even for basic use cases. Are you mutating data?

How are you handling concurrent writes and reads? reply nrr 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s unclear whether you mean that it&#x27;s simpler to make a query and iterate over the rows to massage the result in your application or to make a query and then iterate over the returned rows to make more single-row queries.

Consider that now cost management&#x2F;analysis tools that were historically focused only on cloud, are now adding the same tooling for costly SaaS solutions!I understand that many HN readers are skewed towards SaaS solutions, usually because they work at a SaaS shop, but depending on the size of the company, the overhead for managing it internally can totally be worth.

Otel markets itself as a universal tracing&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;logs format and set of plug and play libraries that has adapters for everything you need. It&#x27;s actually a bunch of half&#x2F;poorly implemented libraries with a ton of leaky internals, bad adapters, and actually not a lot of functionality. reply fshr 11 hours agoparentOk, then do you have a suggestion for an alternative, or do you just put up with OT? reply maccard 9 hours agorootparentI agree with OP, but I put up with Otel reply iofiiiiiiiii 15 hours agoparentprevAgreed, I find myself having to think orthogonally to common sense whenever I try to use one of its SDKs. Nothing works the way you expect it to, everything has 3 layers of unnecessary abstraction and needs to be approached via the back door. Many features have caveats about when it works, where it works, how much it works, during what phase of the moon it works and how long your strings can be when Jupiter is visible in the sky.That said, if we disregard the leaky SDK APIs and half-implemented everything, it does somewhat deliver on the pluggability promise. Before OTel, you had bespoke stacks for everything. Now there is some commonality - you can plug in different logging backends to one standard SDK and expect it to more or less work. Yes, it works less well than a vertically integrated stack but this is still something. It enables competition and evolution piece by piece, without having to replace an observability stack outright (never going to be a convincing proposition).So while the developer experience is pretty unpleasant and I am also disappointed with the actual daily usage, from an architectural perspective it opens up new opportunities that did not exist before. It is at least a partial win. reply cratermoon 15 hours agoparentprevOkay but can you point to some specific experience and suggest improvements? reply caust1c 15 hours agorootparentTry implementing an OTEL Tracer.

Don&#x27;t they publish an implementation? reply phillipcarter 12 hours agorootparentYes, all SDKs have a tracer you can just use. While you can technically create your own tracer, you&#x27;re officially in Hard Mode territory - there&#x27;s no highly extensible system I&#x27;m aware of that makes swapping core concepts (that already have a default) easy. replyno_wizard 16 hours agoprevThe OTEL official project libraries don&#x27;t work well on the web frontend yet. No way of correlating errors to source-maps for instance, at least out of the box.The web browser collector published by the OTEL project uses Zone.js to hijack just about everything in the browser into contexts. If you used modern Angular before, you may recognize zone.js, its a real pain sometimes, and messes with globals, which isn&#x27;t great, as it can create situations where behavior isn&#x27;t predictable.I don&#x27;t know that OTEL has any standard around things like session replays either. Lots of telemetry platforms support this (Sentry, Rollbar, DataDog etc)I think alot of backend teams have really like it. I do like the cross boundary nature of spans where you can follow them by a unique tag across your entire system.I personally find its extremely verbose at times, in terms of the payload it generates, some logging platforms are more compact in this regard, but in practice, I haven&#x27;t noticed it to be an issue reply mikeshi42 4 hours agoparentWe&#x27;ve found that across most platforms, Otel is more of a starting point to building good instrumentation libraries.

Maybe it&#x27;s better now, but I doubt it.In our case it was 100% a \"tick off some boxes on their strategy roadmap documents\" project too and we had much much better solutions.OTel is one of those \"yeah, it works ...

In 2021, very few things in OTel were GA and there wasn&#x27;t nearly as much automatic instrumentation.

All of these things are now different. reply arp242 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll be happy to take your word that some implementation issues are now improved, but things like \"overengineered\" and \"way to complex for what it needs to do\" really are foundational, and can&#x27;t just be \"fixed\" without starting from scratch (and presumably this is all by design in the first place). reply phillipcarter 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair. I find that to be a bit subjective anyways, so I don&#x27;t have much to comment on there. Most languages are pretty lightweight. For example, initializing instrumentation packages and creating some custom instrumentation in Python is very lightweight. Golang is far more verbose, though.

(Datadog had a literal army of people adding datadog support to OSS projects. Honestly, probably a great early-career job; diving into unfamiliar codebases is a superpower.)OTel lets the open source projects use an abstraction layer so that you can buy instead of self-host.None of this has ever made me feel super great, but in the end I would probably consider OTel today for services that people other than my company operate. That way if some user wants to use Datadog, we&#x27;re not in their way.I used OTel in the very very early days and was rather disappointed; the Go APIs were extremely inefficient (a context.Context is needed to increment a counter? no IO in my request path please), and abstracted leakily (no way to set histogram buckets when exporting to Prometheus). I assume they probably fixed that stuff at some point, though. reply the_duke 16 hours agorootparentWhat helps hosted data collectors helps self-hosting setups just as much.More and more solutions are getting built in OTEL support, which means you can relatively seamlessly switch between backends without changing anything in your application code. reply morelisp 16 hours agorootparentThis only makes sense if you&#x27;re in a world where you&#x27;re switching backends more than once, which means you&#x27;re not seriously programming, you&#x27;re just burning VC money for lottery tickets. reply jrockway 15 hours agorootparentI agree with this. For internal apps, pick a system and stick with it. If you&#x27;re excited by Datadog&#x27;s marketing pitch, just buy it and use it.

It&#x27;s a praxis that you apply to your code as your write it, like I guess error handling; it&#x27;s not a product that you can deploy, like I guess Splunk or New Relic or whatever else.You should \"use\" metrics, logs, and traces thru dependencies that are specific to your organization. The interface between your business logic and operational telemetry should be abstract, essentially the same as a database or a remote HTTP endpoint or etc. The concrete system(s) collecting and serving telemetry data are the responsibility of your dev&#x2F;ops or whatever team.Main point: instrumentation is part of the development process, not something that&#x27;s automatic or that can be bolted-on. reply pgwhalen 17 hours agorootparentHave you worked with OTEL before?

Sounds like what OTEL provides to me reply kiitos 13 hours agorootparentThere are well-defined interfaces for specific sub-classes of telemetry data. Prometheus provides a set of interfaces for metrics which are pretty battle-tested by now. There are similar interfaces for logs and traces, authored by various different parties, and with various different capabilities, trade-offs, etc.There is no one true interface! The interface is a function of the sub-class of telemetry data it serves, the specific properties of the service(s) it supports, the teams it&#x27;s used by, the organization that maintains it, etc. etc.OTel tries to assert a general-purpose interface. But this is exactly the issue with the project. That interface doesn&#x27;t exist. reply klysm 12 hours agorootparentOTEL is a set of interfaces, so I’m not sure your last point applies. I do agree that battle tested things like Prometheus work great, but why not have a set of standardized interfaces? There is clearly a cost to having them; for some projects this may be too much.

The complexity overhead of labels in OpenTelemetry does not make it the slam-dunk it appears to be.Internally, OTEL has to keep track of every combination of labels it&#x27;s seen since process start, which can easily come to dominate the processing time in an existing project. It&#x27;s another in a long line of tools that dovetail with my overall software development philosophy which is that you can make pretty much any process work for 18 months before the wheels fall off.By the time you notice OpenTelemetry is a problem, you&#x27;ve got 18 months of work to start trying to roll back. reply adra 6 hours agorootparentI have no idea why you think that all attributes need to be buffered in process forever. Most metrics systems simply keep key sets in ram cached for as long as they&#x27;re still being emitted. Many drop unused key sets after like 10 minutes. But like all metrics processing, you should ideally keep cardinality to a bound set in order to avoid these types of issues both client and server side.I&#x27;m sure there are valid qualms with OTEL in general, but this ain&#x27;t one of them. Any and all metrics telemetry systems can fall into the same design constraint you pointed out. reply hinkley 5 hours agorootparentI don’t know which one implementations support invalidation but it’s not happening for the nodejs impl.Push implementations do not have this problem at the client end. replyhankchinaski 17 hours agoparentprevI kind of agree with you.

But I have been reluctant to add in another thing to manage and train on if it means that the datadog agent is still necessary for anything outside of the basics.Has anyone else actually tried hooking this up to datadog?Edit: just to be clear, my driving goal of this is not necessarily to keep it with datadog.

Datadog has 80% gross margin, so at most 20% of what you pay them is the infra, so you stand to save a lot of money running your own open source stacks if your labor costs would be less than that 80%.

A common tool for that purpose is Prometheus. You certainly can&#x27;t query Prometheus for individual requests, which is fine, and accepting that invariant allows Prometheus to treat input data as statistical, in the sense that you mean in your comment.But if we&#x27;re talking about general-purpose telemetry, we&#x27;re talking about more than just high-level summaries of system behavior, we also need to be able to inspect individual log events, trace spans, etc. If a user made a request an hour ago with reqid 123, I expect to be able to query my telemetry system for reqid 123 and see all of the metadata related to that request.A telemetry system that samples prior to ingest certainly delivers value, but it can only ever solve the first use case, and never the second. reply number101010 18 hours agoparentprevMost observability vendors support OTEL at this point.

Though using a standard library supported by a bunch of collector tools like ClickHouse is useful it itself, there&#x27;s another benefit too. The specification allows transferring trace IDs across system boundaries. If you and your dependencies all implement the OpenTelemetry spec, then you get spans that reveal in granular detail what happened in the journey. For example, you could learn that it was your database loading a page from disk that took so long, or that a Cloud service&#x27;s metadata plane was the responsible span for high latency. reply bilalq 15 hours agoprevOpenTelemetry is being pushed as a replacement for AWS X-Ray SDKs by AWS, but it&#x27;s in such a broken state for Lambda right now.

There&#x27;s currently a proposal to add some stuff that makes creating the span easier to make it auto-closing based on scope.FWIW the philosophy here is that observability is a part of the application rather than something separate. That&#x27;s distinctly different from the APM philosophy, which is that a separate process \"does the observability\" and your app is \"clean\" from that. I think there&#x27;s quite a benefit to manually instrumenting in your codebase intentionally rather than having an automated process do it for you. But I can understand not wanting to go through and do that. reply CubsFan1060 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an interesting distinction. Given some of the older, larger code bases, manually instrumenting seems like it would require a reasonably large effort. I think that&#x27;s one of the huge benefits that some of the APM&#x27;s bring.I wonder if there is any reason OTEL can&#x27;t have both. reply phillipcarter 15 hours agorootparentOTel kind of has both today. Most languages support autoinstrumentation via either an agent, libraries, or both. So for example, if you&#x27;ve got a big Spring Boot app, it&#x27;ll instrument requests&#x2F;responses and DB calls for you. Some languages also have lightweight \"sprinkle some spans on it\" things you can put in code, like Java method annotations.

Originally the main issue i had was supporting tracing across common libraries (there wasn&#x27;t a lot of libraries supported back then). Now (and i recently worked with it) i would say is which protocol is supported by which component: your sdk generate spans&#x2F;metrics in a specific format, then you send that to a collector that accept a range of protocol versions and finally you can send that to your vendor ... but you need to know which protocol&#x2F;version it supports.That&#x27;s not actually something you can do much about considering the sheer size of opentelemetry (both in term of implementation and vendors working on it) and i expect for people implementing nowadays, proto should be pretty stable and my experience should theorically not be the case anymore. reply dboreham 17 hours agoparentprevExperience has been positive.

OpenTelemetry also ships the Collector, which is like a patch-bay accepting many different data formats and sending on in more formats.Grafana Agent is a bundling of a bunch of things for collecting instrumentation. The idea is to simplify deployment and allow opinionated setup. The Agent can upload to Grafana Cloud, or to any compatible backend (all the basic components are open source).In particular it bundles Prometheus Agent, which does metrics collection from anything Prometheus-compatible but not queries, and OTel Collector.It also bundles Promtail for logs.(I work for Grafana Labs) reply skrtskrt 18 hours agoparentprevPrometheus: metrics collector&#x2F;databases with a defined metrics format.Many metrics&#x2F;timeseries databases make an effort to be \"Prometheus-compatible\" as it was kind of the unofficial standard.OTEL: new open standards which are supposed to provide vendor-independent formats which are compatible and composable between metrics, logs, and traces, and easily enable things like deriving metrics from traces (latency would be an obvious one here).Grafana Agent: a metrics? maybe also logs and traces? collector that supports Prometheus, OTEL and other metrics formats, which can forward, sample, and transform the data. Made by Grafana, open source, etc.Grafana&#x27;s metrics DB Mimir and maybe some others are essentially \"more scalable prometheus\", and use prometheus metrics format on disc, so one large concern of the Grafana Agent would be converting OTEL metrics to prometheus metrics format for ingestion into the Grafana databases - but the agent has a whole bunch of other functions supported as well.OTEL Collector - non-vendor-specific collector, like Grafana Agent but largely just concerned with allowing collection&#x2F;ingestion of OTEL and coverting other formats into OTEL.

    "originBody": "autoevolution Home > News > Coverstory New Images and Video Confirm Austin-Made Tesla Model Y Has Cracked Front Casting Published: 26 Aug 2023, 19:32 UTC • By: Gustavo Henrique Ruffo When I first told my readers about an Austin-made Tesla Model Y with a cracked front casting, the owner had yet to confirm how serious the problem was. It did not take long: apart from using a flashlight and a mechanic pick to show it affected more than the skinny paint that component has, NK also told me more about his lengthy struggle to correct his brand-new Model Y – which led to a more extensive investigation. 13 photos Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla The electric SUV owner told me he still prefers that I use only his initials and his other nickname (Cracked_Tesla) because he wants to give another Tesla Service Center a chance to do the right thing. Believe me: NK is spending a lot of energy to get a proper response from the battery electric vehicle (BEV) maker. The Model Y owner discovered the issue in May, two months after taking delivery of the vehicle. It is his first Tesla. \"At delivery, I inspected the car based on the main things other owners said to check. At the time, everything was fine, but I did not check the frame or structural members, as the car was new from the factory, and one shouldn't have to check that.\" Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla NK denied his car was ever involved in any collisions. Ironically, he discovered the cracked front casting when he was investigating another serious issue that his Model Y could present: a missing brake fluid reservoir cap. Believe it or not, for anyone to check if the brake fluid reservoir is in place, they will have to remove the plastic cover on the base of the windscreen. The second embedded video here shows that on a Model 3, which shares several components with the electric SUV. \"I saw this post on Reddit and thought it was extremely dangerous if there was no cap to the brake fluid. And based on Tesla's track record of issues, I had to check my car.\" An open brake fluid reservoir is a death trap: the vehicle can either lose brake fluid, or this substance may absorb moisture as time goes by, which will make the brakes fail. As much as a Tesla may have regenerative braking, it is not enough to stop the car in emergencies. If it were, the BEV maker would have found a way to eliminate it and save some bucks, rest assured. Cracked_Tesla's car had the cap, but its front casting was cracked, as the images I've published in my first article show. \"May is when I first saw the cracks and submitted the service request. I was not able to take the car to the service center until July, so that's when the whole saga began.\" Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla I'd count all four months since the issue was discovered, but NK generously says he has been dealing with the problem with Tesla for the last two. If the company had offered to correct that right from the start, we probably would have never heard of the flaw. Unfortunately, that was not how Tesla decided to deal with NK's concerns. \"The manager of the service center said multiple times that 'the car is safe to drive' and that he had been assured by 'engineers' that it is 'safe.' However, he will not give me anything in more detail or any official Tesla documentation to confirm that.\" The Tesla Files episode revealed that the BEV maker instructs its technicians always to provide feedback orally. Internal documents obtained by Handelsblatt stated: \"Do not copy the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer.\" That was not acceptable for NK, notably after he managed to see and film light beams from his flashlight crossing the cracked front casting. You can check the video below, which Cracked_Tesla published on his YouTube channel and allowed me to embed in this article. Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla Pay careful attention to the area of the crack right below where it bifurcates. The flashlight shines there right at the beginning of the video. I recommend you watch this on your cellphone, where the video format is more favorable. It leaves no doubt about how deep the damage is. The mechanic pick was not even necessary to confirm the issue, but NK used it as well. \"I was shocked, scared, and nervous for my safety as it is my only method of transportation.\" So far, Cracked_Tesla has not heard of any other cases like the one involving his BEV. Although even the Model Y owner wishes his car to be the only one affected, that is very unlikely. Giga Grünheide faced 60% of rejected cast parts about a year ago. There are pictures of these rejected parts pilling up in Fremont. If NK's Model Y received a component that should also have been discarded by quality control, others may have reached production units as well. NK's alert should get Austin-made BEV owners to verify that. If you repair Tesla vehicles and have ever seen anything like this, please let NK and me know. If the BEV maker is so sure that this is not serious, it should provide Cracked_Tesla at least with a document that gives him some peace of mind. I'll let you know about all the developments this story may have.

It arrived with a \"squeak\" that turned out to be due to missing welds in structural components of the chassis. They wanted him to sign an NDA to get a replacement vehicle (which he refused to do, both on principle, and because he&#x27;d talked to friends about it already). So he was forced to keep his vehicle, which was then repaired under warranty for what they initially said was not a warrantable defect. To quote him \"They took a huge proponent and turned them into someone who will never, ever, recommend them\"And this is how they treated their early adopters that were paying $100K in 2015 for their higher end cars. reply thejazzman 18 hours agoparentMy 2015&#x27;s battery \"died\" the day after the warranty was up.$15k for a refurbished battery from another old broken car. Once fixed, the cars resell value is at about $20k.And they took my battery back to sell to someone else for $15k.Definitely feel like a HUGE sucker for supporting them. This thing was $101k new. reply scoofy 15 hours agorootparentI had a few very smart friends who were very successful in business at a young age. They all sort of celebrated having made it by buying high-end Audi’s when they were the hot luxury cars in the mid-2000’s.The cars weren’t very reliable (even dumb shit like the electric windows would break) and the repairs were notably more expensive than they should have been. One of them explained that he finally understood that someone willing to pay triple the price of a standard car can be charged triple for repairs too.He sold the luxury car and bought a Prius and said it was 100x better just because of how reliable it was, and it had the same bells and whistles anyway. reply Gibbon1 3 hours agorootparentI remember 7-8 years ago taking a trip down HWY35, then dropped down into Portola Valley. 5-10M dollar houses. Lot of them had a Prius sitting in the driveway next way more expensive cars. reply murkt 14 hours agorootparentprev> it had the same bells and whistles anywayElectric windows, sure. reply scoofy 13 hours agorootparentI mean, I didn&#x27;t own the car so I have no idea what \"options\" a luxury car could have over a standard car with all the extra options included, but he sure seemed to think that the Prius had exactly the same things he enjoyed in the Audi.Note, we were in Austin where something like leather seats would be a bad idea. reply Cthulhu_ 19 hours agoparentprevWho&#x27;s to stop the victim from recording evidence, accepting the replacement car, and submitting said evidence anonymously to the media and &#x2F; or consumer protection and &#x2F; or the car safety institutions?Are NDAs like that actually enforceable? reply chrisco255 19 hours agorootparentIt would be a weird play for anyone to sign such a thing. Most states in the U.S. have lemon laws that prevent maufacturers from selling such vehicles. A manufacturer only gets a certain number of attempts at repairs (usually 3 for new cars) on new vehicles or a limited time frame to fix them before they must offer a full replacement. reply stef25 19 hours agorootparent> A manufacturer only gets a certain number of attempts at repairs (usually 3 for new cars) on new vehicles or a limited time frame to fix them before they must offer a full replacementWow that would be awesome. Someone I know here in the EU had a leaking sun roof on their Toyota and after so many fixes and replacements that did nothing (and she had to pay for) the dealer basically said \"we can&#x27;t fix it, the parts are made by another company bla bla ...\". reply Someone 18 hours agorootparent> the dealer basically said \"we can&#x27;t fix it, the parts are made by another company bla bla ...\".If that was a new car recently bought from that dealer, that’s their problem. In the EU (for sales to consumers), it’s the seller that’s responsible for delivering a product that’s fit for purpose. This dealer can’t hide behind the manufacturer or its suppliers (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;citizens&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;shopping&#x2F;gua...)If the car wasn’t bought there or was older than 2 years, the rules only apply to the repair, not to the entire car. I think that means they would either have to fully repair the roof or give you something that’s at least as good as what you brought in for free (things do get murky there for my understanding of the law)(of course, all that is in theory. In practice, companies will try to avoid having to do that) reply Roark66 18 hours agorootparentprev>Wow that would be awesome. Someone I know here in the EU had a leaking sun roof on their Toyota and after so many fixes and replacements that did nothing (and she had to pay for) the dealer basically said \"we can&#x27;t fix it, the parts are made by another company bla blaI never heard of a US lemon law equivalent for the EU, but the EU has pretty good general consumer protection. It varies somewhat between countries, but here in Poland if you buy a new item, if it breaks, it gets repaired under warranty and then it breaks again (it doesn&#x27;t have to be the same component) the consumer has a choice of asking for a replacement, lowering of the price, or even withdrawing from the purchase altogether. Most people are not aware of this and are getting strung along by unscrupulous sellers. I myself had a situation like this with an induction hob that broke 6 times during the warranty. They then replaced it for a new one and that too broke a month later. I didn&#x27;t even call them, I threw the damn thing out and I bought a different brand. It has been 3 years and that one has been working fine. Had I known I can withdraw from the purchase back then I&#x27;d definitely do it. reply version_five 18 hours agorootparentprevWe don&#x27;t have lemon laws in Canada either, I had a major problem with my brand new truck and the manufacturer and dealer were useless, strung me along and refused to help. I ended up giving up and trading it in and buying something else (obviously another brand), it wasn&#x27;t worth the fight. reply alamortsubite 18 hours agorootparentprevSome dealers offer third-party accessories as options on new cars. I had a car whose aftermarket sunroof was installed by the dealer when it was bought by the original owner. Fortunately, mine never leaked, but I&#x27;m not sure the US Lemon Laws would have covered it if it had. reply aequitas 18 hours agorootparentWhen buying in the EU (at least where I&#x27;m from) the contract is between the consumer and the seller. So if something is wrong the seller can&#x27;t shift blame to the manufacturer and have me have to deal with them. How they handle the issue with the manufacturer is their problem. If they can&#x27;t offer a repair or replacement they need to refund. Manufacturers can offer additional warranty on top of the legally required warranty the seller has to offer which will fall outside of the sellers responsibility. reply Macha 1 hour agorootparentCompanies do sometimes make it difficult in a way I hope more of them get slapped one. The largest electronics retailer in my country will have their front line staff try their hardest to deflect you to the manufacturer warranty, their online return form will make you enter a manufacturer ticket number as a mandatory field, so to actually get that honoured, your best bet is usually to go in store and escalate to a manager.Normally I try to support stores over Amazon in a \"use it or lose it\" sense but that particular retailer is the exception. replynimajneb 19 hours agorootparentprevMy bet is that becomes a scenerio where the party with the most money for lawyers wins. If it was me, I would have almost no money for lawyers. reply latchkey 19 hours agorootparentNo money for lawyers, before or after you spent $100k on a car? reply thejazzman 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s pretty painful to drop thousands on lawyers when you know they have significantly more money and better lawyersI say this as a person who very much wanted to sue Tesla and backed down on the advice of my lawyer friend -- I was most likely only increasing my net loss and severely stressing myself out reply latchkey 18 hours agorootparentThank you for confirming one of the many reasons I&#x27;d probably never buy a Tesla.It (and the blue check), just isn&#x27;t worth it. reply HPMOR 19 hours agorootparentprevHaving recently dealt with this very situation. Lawyers are honestly not __that__ expensive for these disputes and NDA’s are largely unenforceable. reply nightpool 19 hours agorootparentHow expensive is not that expensive, out of curiosity? reply drewg123 18 hours agorootparentprevWas it with Tesla? Curious what happened.. reply gruez 17 hours agorootparentprev>NDA’s are largely unenforceablesource? reply stapedium 16 hours agorootparentFile a lawsuit to get them to lemon law the thing. Court testimony is public record that can’t be NDAd. reply gruez 16 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t mean NDAs are unenforceable. It just means you&#x27;re getting them to fix the problem without signing their NDA, and presumably going through more hassle in the process. replygabereiser 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly why NDA&#x27;s are enforceable. If you sign one, you can not break it without risking litigation. In Tesla&#x27;s case, they totally would. You can&#x27;t share any information that is called out in the NDA. This would probably include video, recordings, messages, media, any and all online posts referring to the incident and future discussions of the incident. Whatever is specifically called out in the NDA as far as terms, timeframe, etc. There are some NDA&#x27;s that are for life. reply onlyrealcuzzo 19 hours agoparentprev> And this is how they treated their early adopters that were paying $100K in 2015 for their higher end cars.And yet it didn&#x27;t stop anyone from buying Teslas... It&#x27;s almost as if they knew they could get away with murder. reply jen20 18 hours agorootparentThis kind of thing certainly stopped me from buying one, even in the days before they were referred to as “MAGAmobiles”.Instead I waited for companies that actually know how to make cars to work out how to make electric cars. reply Fatnino 18 hours agorootparentWho is calling them MAGAmobiles?A MAGAmobile is a lifted truck that rolls coal and has a huge lets go brandon decal reply thejazzman 18 hours agorootparentEveryone I know with a Tesla is very much anti-Musk and bought before he totally jumped the horse reply onlyrealcuzzo 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I thought it was way more MAGA to burn fossil fuels than drive an electric car. reply res0nat0r 18 hours agorootparentprevTeslas are being called MAGAmobiles now that Musk bought Twitter and has shown his love for rightwing disinformation and keeps replying to and platforming alt-right racists and other neo-nazi adjacent folks. reply taftster 10 hours agorootparentI have this theory that Musk is just playing a long con and deep fake on all of us. He wasn&#x27;t selling his cars to the likes of MAGA, so he jumped ship and switched sides to make Teslas look cool to the red consumers. The timing of the Cybertruck somewhat coincides with this flip.So now, Teslas are cool according to those right fringe folks. Of course, the blue side consumers are not super excited about Tesla anymore, but they are already \"stuck\" with their models (in general). And the red consumers are a bit more likely (maybe?) to follow a fad.Eventually, Musk will level out and Tesla Motors will just be a mediocre line of vehicles without too much political pop culture. But for now, he&#x27;s basically playing with everyone to sway various opinions of himself and his companies (e.g. stroking his ego along the way). reply lukeholder 4 hours agorootparentNah most of the world doesn’t see themselves as red or blue and just wants an electric car. People who see everything through the lens of a party and a 2 party system are suckers. reply Gud 17 hours agorootparentprevMaybe in some tiny bubble, not in the actual world. reply res0nat0r 16 hours agorootparent? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?sca_esv=560664892&rlz=1C5GCEM_... reply Gud 15 hours agorootparent1(!)

A colleague has model S, in Switzerland, when going for some service checks they kept him there, in the middle of nowhere without any good public transport for half a day without any warning during work day, he was furious.Every single crappy dealer&#x2F;official service here will give you a replacement car to not mess up your life for just stupid car checks, whatever basic car is fine.

Internal documents obtained by Handelsblatt stated: \"Do not copy the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer.\"I don&#x27;t know how serious a crack in the front casting on a Tesla is, but this kind of policy is pretty egregious. reply kramerger 21 hours agoparent\"Do this only orally\" is always to hide evidence from a future court discovery.I don&#x27;t think Tesla would do this unless management consider it very serious. reply peeters 20 hours agorootparentThat kind of policy should mean that in any court case where a customer&#x27;s version of events&#x2F;conversations differs from Tesla&#x27;s, the customer is assumed to be telling the truth until definitely proven otherwise. The legal liability of this policy should be so great that no sane company would have this policy over just creating a paper trail in the first place. reply jejeyyy77 19 hours agorootparentlol, thats not how it works at all. reply vikramkr 19 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s why the parent comment was using the word \"should\" a lot reply Zarathustra30 18 hours agorootparentFor those unclear on the definitions, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc2119 reply singleshot_ 14 hours agorootparentprevHow would you interpret the following:if electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party fails to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information to use in the litigation may presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party. reply maffydub 20 hours agorootparentprevIn previous employment (as a software engineer), I&#x27;ve been told to do this too - mainly around inventions we were trying to patent. The reason is slightly less nefarious than you might think - for example, someone might casually say that some aspect of their patent is \"obvious\" but they&#x27;re saying that as an expert in their field who may have spent months or years thinking about the problem and alternative solutions. However, if it came to court, \"even the inventor said this was obvious\" is a pretty hard thing to respond to. reply Jka9rhnDJos 18 hours agorootparentTo provide my own anecdote, refusing to take any feedback except orally was how the Sacklers instructed their sales reps to handle issues and concerns about Oxycontin abuse. It was to avoid having any discoverable evidence that they received reports of abuse and did nothing about it. reply vel0city 18 hours agorootparentprevI agree its usually not good to sprinkle legal landmines in your email history, but FWIW the obviousness standard for US patents is someone \"skilled in the art\", so an expert working in that field finding it obvious is failing the obviousness test. reply idiotsecant 18 hours agorootparentOK, but you get what parent post is saying. This particular example might have a technical answer but the overall point is that emails tend to lack context and are composed for brevity &#x2F; convenience.\"If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.\" - Cardinal Richelieu reply ImPostingOnHN 16 hours agorootparentit sounded like the overall point was that, by avoiding retained communications, they could get away with something they otherwise would not be able to get away with, and should not be able to get away with (patenting something obvious)what sort of context could be added which exonerates that behavior?if the context exonerates it, why not have a policy of including context?if it&#x27;s somehow benign, but cited out of context, why not just provide the context?and, if such exonerating context doesn&#x27;t exist, wouldn&#x27;t society prefer they not get away with patenting something obvious? reply OkayPhysicist 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a hell of a lot easier to not have to defend a statement made out of context than it is to do so. It&#x27;s the same reason you should never, ever, under any circumstances answer any questions about anything at all coming from the police without your lawyer. Even if you are completely innocent, your words can be presented in such a manner as to call into question your honesty, at which point your rebuttal will be shrouded by distrust.The quintessential example is an alibi. If the cops accuse me of shooting someone in SF, but I was in Berkeley at the time, I might be tempted to tell them that.

For example, lots of times in long email or slack threads people throw out ideas, even if they&#x27;re not particularly well thought out, because that&#x27;s part of what being in an open, healthy organization entails.

Their instructions were that if anyone was recording the call you were to read a certain script and immediately disconnect, no questions asked. If they tried to do the &#x27;this call may be recorded&#x27; thing you were supposed to seek clarification about whether the call is being recorded and if the answer was anything other than no, you were to read the same script and immediately disconnect.These companies know that worker bee call center drones say things all the time that the company doesn&#x27;t want preserved in a court of law later- mainly promises that the company doesn&#x27;t want to have to uphold if they were outside policy.

He took delivery roughly a year after they were announced. Tesla forgot to install weather stripping in the frunk. \"Flood\" is too strong a word, but yes, during a rain storm water seeped into the frunk. This car is very expensive, but honestly I would expect an entry-level Toyota to have correct weather stripping.Elon is all about \"hardcore.\" He belittles his own employees and plays classes against one another — claiming information workers should continue to commute on the Bart just like factory workers. But oh, by the way, he takes a private jet from meeting to meeting.So what baffles me is how Elon Musk continues to say casually that production ramp is \"really hard.\" I have no doubt that it is, but the Model S was released in 2012.

Just based on my hobbyist knowledge it&#x27;s a metal that behaves a lot more predictably. reply hn_throwaway_99 17 hours agoparentThe problem with how difficult aluminum casting is or is not is totally irrelevant.The real problem is that this structural member with a giant visible crack in it somehow made it through Tesla&#x27;s QA process.

Let&#x27;s say the issue is a substandard batch from a supplier that cracks from stress at some stage of the frame assembly (like when adding the battery pack, welding or adhesive bonding). The car should be inspected after all structural parts are added, at minimum visually but ideally with some kind of spectroscopy.Also, if this is a whole batch with this issue it should have been noticed when doing QC on the shipment.One option is that this happened at some stage during shipping (maybe the car rolled off a trailer and fell half a meter). Still, the dealership should be doing an inspection before handing the car over.All in all, if this really isn&#x27;t the result of some accident it is a total failure. reply manuelabeledo 20 hours agorootparentAnother option is that workers at the factory are now pushing bad parts knowingly, to get the truck out of the door.Let&#x27;s not forget that the truck has been delayed for over two years now.

There may be good reasons the industry doesn&#x27;t do that. It may be something that an experienced engineer would advise against. reply chrisco255 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s mostly just a lack of willingness to spend on large casting machines. Tesla is famous for purchasing the largest presses: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Giga_PressTesla is partly empowered to do this because electric vehicles are mechanically simpler than ICEs, and the batteries themselves also are made to be structural components. There&#x27;s nothing fundamentally unsound about pressed aluminum. reply Fluorescence 18 hours agorootparentOne of the reasons it isn&#x27;t done is the QC problem. If you have a 10% rejection rate on 20 parts, 18 parts will pass. If they were all one mega-part, the whole casting has to be rejected. You then add in repairability issues and no flexibility to accommodate other types of manufacturing variability (errors, fit) and your savings from a single casting can become a big deficit instead.Sadly the reason this bad casting was shipped to a customer is probably because they are not achieving the desired pass rate so they knowingly wave through defective castings. reply jeffbee 18 hours agorootparentprevThe casting flaw in the OP would never have passed through a working quality control system, which would be automated radiography.

Using conventional techniques such as rebuilding indexes and tables we cleared up a lot of space, but then one surprising find helped us clear an additional ~20GB of unused indexed values! This is what the free storage chart of one of our databases looked like in the process: Free space over time (higher means more free space) Table of Contents The Usual Suspects Unused Indexes Index and Table Bloat Clearing Bloat in Indexes Activating B-Tree Index Deduplication Clearing Bloat in Tables Using pg_repack The \"Find\" The \"Aha Moment\" Utilizing Partial Indexes Bonus: Migrating with Django ORM Prevent Implicit Creation of Indexes on Foreign Keys Migrate Exiting Full Indexes to Partial Indexes Conclusion The Usual Suspects Provisioning storage is something we do from time to time, but before we throw money at the problem we like to make sure we make good use of the storage we already have. To do that, we start with the usual suspects. Unused Indexes Unused indexes are double-edged swords; you create them to make things faster, but they end up taking space and slow inserts and updates. Unused indexes are the first thing we always check when we need to clear up storage. To find unused indexes we use the following query: SELECT relname, indexrelname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelname::regclass)) as size FROM pg_stat_all_indexes WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND indexrelname NOT LIKE 'pg_toast_%' AND idx_scan = 0 AND idx_tup_read = 0 AND idx_tup_fetch = 0 ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelname::regclass) DESC; The query is looking for indexes that were not scanned or fetched since the last time the statistics were reset. Some indexes may seem like they were not used but they were in-fact used: The documentation lists a few scenarios when this is possible. For example, when the optimizer uses meta data from the index, but not the index itself. Indexes used to enforce unique or primary key constraints for tables that were not updated in a while. The indexes will look like they were not used, but it doesn't mean we can dispose of them. To find the unused indexes you can actually drop, you usually have to go over the list one by one and make a decision. This can be time consuming in the first couple of times, but after you get rid of most unused indexes it becomes easier. It's also a good idea to reset the statistics counters from time to time, usually right after you finished inspecting the list. PostgreSQL provides a few functions to reset statistics at different levels. When we find an index we suspect is not being used, or when we add new indexes in place of old ones, we usually reset the counters for the table and wait for a while: -- Find table oid by name SELECT oid FROM pg_class c WHERE relname = 'table_name'; -- Reset counts for all indexes of table SELECT pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters(14662536); We do this every once in a while, so in our case there were no unused indexes to drop. Index and Table Bloat The next suspect is bloat. When you update rows in a table, PostgreSQL marks the tuple as dead and adds the updated tuple in the next available space. This process creates what's called \"bloat\", which can cause tables to consume more space than they really need. Bloat also affects indexes, so to free up space, bloat is a good place to look. Estimating bloat in tables and indexes is apparently not a simple task. Lucky for us, some good people on the world wide web already did the hard work and wrote queries to estimate table bloat and index bloat. After running these queries you will most likely find some bloat, so the next thing to do it clear up that space. Clearing Bloat in Indexes To clear bloat in an index, you need to rebuild it. There are several ways to rebuild an index: Re-create the index: If you re-create the index, it will be built in an optimal way. Rebuild the index: Instead of dropping and creating the index yourself, PostgreSQL provides a way to re-build an existing index in-place using the REINDEX command: REINDEX INDEX index_name; Rebuild the index concurrently: The previous methods will obtain a lock on the table and prevent it from being changed while the operation is in progress, which is usually unacceptable. To rebuild the index without locking it for updates, you can rebuilt the index concurrently: REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_name; When using REINDEX CONCURRENTLY, PostgreSQL creates a new index with a name suffixed with _ccnew, and syncs any changes made to the table in the meantime. When the rebuild is done, it will switch the old index with the new index, and drop the old one. Clearing bloat in Indexes If for some reason you had to stop the rebuild in the middle, the new index will not be dropped. Instead, it will be left in an invalid state and consume space. To identify invalid indexes that were created during REINDEX, we use the following query: -- Identify invalid indexes that were created during index rebuild SELECT c.relname as index_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(c.oid)) FROM pg_index i JOIN pg_class c ON i.indexrelid = c.oid WHERE -- New index built using REINDEX CONCURRENTLY c.relname LIKE '%_ccnew' -- In INVALID state AND NOT indisvalid LIMIT 10; Once the rebuild process is no longer active, it should be safe to drop any remaining invalid indexes. Activating B-Tree Index Deduplication PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new efficient way of storing duplicate values in B-Tree indexes called \"B-Tree Deduplication\". For each indexed value, a B-Tree index will hold in its leaf both the value and a pointer to the row (TID). The larger the indexed values, the larger the index. Up until PostgreSQL 12, when the index contained many duplicate values, all of these duplicate values would be stored in the index leaves. This is not very efficient and can take up a lot of space. B-Tree Index Deduplication Starting at PostgreSQL 13, when B-Tree deduplication is activated, duplicate values are only stored once. This can make a huge impact on the size of indexes with many duplicate values. In PostgreSQL 13 index deduplication in enabled by default, unless you deactivate it: -- Activating de-deduplication for a B-Tree index, this is the default: CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name) WITH (deduplicate_items = ON) If you are migrating from PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you need to rebuild the indexes using the REINDEX command in order to get the full benefits of index de-deduplication. To illustrate the effect of B-Tree deduplication on the size of the index, create a table with a unique column and a non unique column, and populate it with 1M rows. On each column create two B-Tree indexes, one with deduplication enabled and another with deduplication disabled: db=# CREATE test_btree_dedup (n_unique serial, n_not_unique integer); CREATE TABLE db=# INSERT INTO test_btree_dedup (n_not_unique) SELECT (random() * 100)::int FROM generate_series(1, 1000000); INSERT 0 1000000 db=# CREATE INDEX ix1 ON test_btree_dedup (n_unique) WITH (deduplicate_items = OFF); CREATE INDEX db=# CREATE INDEX ix2 ON test_btree_dedup (n_unique) WITH (deduplicate_items = ON); CREATE INDEX db=# CREATE INDEX ix3 ON test_btree_dedup (n_not_unique) WITH (deduplicate_items = OFF); CREATE INDEX db=# CREATE INDEX ix4 ON test_btree_dedup (n_not_unique) WITH (deduplicate_items = ON); CREATE INDEX Next, compare the sizes of the four indexes: COLUMN DEDUPLICATION SIZE Not unique Yes 6840 kB Not unique No 21 MB Unique Yes 21 MB Unique No 21 MB As expected, deduplication had no effect on the unique index, but it had a significant effect on the index that had many duplicate values. Unfortunately for us, PostgreSQL 13 was still fresh at the time, and our cloud provider did not have support for it yet, so we were unable to use deduplication to clear space. Clearing Bloat in Tables Just like in indexes, tables can also contain dead tuples that cause bloat and fragmentation. However, unlike indexes that contain data from an associated table, a table can not just simply be re-created. To re-create a table you would have to create a new table, migrate the data over while keeping it synced with new data, create all the indexes, constraints and any referential constraints in other tables. Only after all of this is done, you can switch the old table with the new one. Clearing bloat in Tables There are several ways to rebuild a table and reduce bloat: Re-create the table: Using this method as described above often requires a lot of development, especially if the table is actively being used as it's being rebuilt. Vacuum the table: PostgreSQL provides a way to reclaim space occupied by bloat and dead tuples in a table using the VACUUM FULL command. Vacuum full requires a lock on the table, and is not an ideal solution for tables that need to be available while being vacuumed: -- Will lock the table VACUUM FULL table_name; The two options above require either a significant effort, or some down time. Using pg_repack Both built-in options for rebuilding tables are not ideal unless you can afford downtime. One popular solution for rebuilding tables and indexes without downtime is the pg_repack extension. Being a popular extension, pg_repack is likely available from your package manager or already installed by your cloud provider. To use pg_repack, you first need to create the extension: CREATE EXTENSION pg_repack; To \"repack\" a table along with its indexes, issue the following command from the console: $ pg_repack -k --table table_name db_name To rebuild a table with no downtime, the extension creates a new table, loads the data from the original table into it while keeping it up to date with new data, and then also rebuilds the indexes. When the process is finished, the two tables are switched and the original table is dropped. See here for full details. PG_REPACK ON RDS pg_repack is a supported extensions for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS. You can find more details on how to use pg_repack on AWS RDS. There are two caveats to be aware of when using pg_repack to rebuild tables: Requires amount of storage roughly the amount of the table to rebuild: the extension creates another table to copy the data to, so it requires additional storage roughly the size of the table and its indexes. May require some manual cleanup: if the \"repack\" process failed or stopped manually, it may leave intermediate objects laying around, so you may need to do some manual cleanup. Despite these caveats, pg_repack is a great option for rebuilding tables and indexes with no downtime. However, because it requires some additional storage to operate, it's not a good option when you are already out of storage. It's a good idea to monitor the free storage space and plan rebuilds in advance. The \"Find\" At this point we already used all the conventional techniques we could think of and cleared up a lot of space. We dropped unused indexes and cleared bloat from tables and indexes, but... there was still more space to shave off! The \"Aha Moment\" While we were looking at the sizes of the indexes after we finished rebuilding them, an interesting thing caught our eye. One of our largest tables stores transaction data. In our system, after a payment is made, the user can choose to cancel and get a refund. This is not happening very often, and only a fraction of the transactions end up being cancelled. In our transactions table, there are foreign keys to both the purchasing user and the cancelling user, and each field has a B-Tree index defined on it. The purchasing user has a NOT NULL constraint on it so all the rows hold a value. The cancelling user on the other hand, is nullable, and only a fraction of the rows hold any data. Most of the values in the cancelling user field are NULL. Transactions Purchasing user Cancelling user Transactions table with FK to purchasing and cancelling user We expected the index on the cancelling user to be significantly smaller than the index on the purchasing user, but they were exactly the same. Coming from Oracle, I was always taught that NULLs are not indexed, but in PostgreSQL they are! This \"Aha\" moment led us to the realization that we were indexing a lot of unnecessary values for no reason. This was the original index we had for the cancelling user: CREATE INDEX transaction_cancelled_by_ix ON transactions(cancelled_by_user_id); To check our thesis, we replaced the index with a partial index that excludes null values: DROP INDEX transaction_cancelled_by_ix; CREATE INDEX transaction_cancelled_by_part_ix ON transactions(cancelled_by_user_id) WHERE cancelled_by_user_id IS NOT NULL; The full index after we reindexed it was 769MB in size, with more than 99% null values. The partial index that excluded null values was less than 5MB. That's more than 99% percent of dead weight shaved off the index! INDEX SIZE Full index 769MB Partial Index 5MB Difference -99% To make sure those NULL values were indeed unnecessary, we reset the stats on the table and waited a while. Not long after, we observed that the index is being used just like the old one! We just shaved off more than 760MB of unused indexed tuples without compromising performance! Clearing space, play by play Utilizing Partial Indexes Once we had a good experience with one partial index, we figured we might have more indexes like that. To find good candidates for partial index we wrote a query to search for indexes on fields with high null_frac, the percent of values of the column that PostgreSQL estimates are NULL: -- Find indexed columns with high null_frac SELECT c.oid, c.relname AS index, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(c.oid)) AS index_size, i.indisunique AS unique, a.attname AS indexed_column, CASE s.null_frac WHEN 0 THEN '' ELSE to_char(s.null_frac * 100, '999.00%') END AS null_frac, pg_size_pretty((pg_relation_size(c.oid) * s.null_frac)::bigint) AS expected_saving -- Uncomment to include the index definition --, ixs.indexdef FROM pg_class c JOIN pg_index i ON i.indexrelid = c.oid JOIN pg_attribute a ON a.attrelid = c.oid JOIN pg_class c_table ON c_table.oid = i.indrelid JOIN pg_indexes ixs ON c.relname = ixs.indexname LEFT JOIN pg_stats s ON s.tablename = c_table.relname AND a.attname = s.attname WHERE -- Primary key cannot be partial NOT i.indisprimary -- Exclude already partial indexes AND i.indpred IS NULL -- Exclude composite indexes AND array_length(i.indkey, 1) = 1 -- Larger than 10MB AND pg_relation_size(c.oid) > 10 * 1024 ^ 2 ORDER BY pg_relation_size(c.oid) * s.null_frac DESC; The results of this query can look like this: oidindexindex_sizeuniqueindexed_columnnull_fracexpected_saving ---------+--------------------+------------+--------+----------------+-----------+----------------- 138247tx_cancelled_by_ix1418 MBfcancelled_by96.15%1363 MB 16988tx_op1_ix1651 MBtop16.11%101 MB 1473377tx_token_ix22 MBttoken11.21%2494 kB 138529tx_op_name_ix1160 MBtname| 0 bytes In the table above we can identify several types of results: tx_cancelled_by_ix is a large index with many null values: great potential here! tx_op_1_ix is a large index with few null values: there's not much potential tx_token_ix is a small index with few null values: I wouldn't bother with this index tx_op_name_ix is a large index with no null values: nothing to do here The results show that by turning tx_cancelled_by_ix into a partial index that excludes null we can potentially save ~1.3GB. Is it always beneficial to exclude nulls from indexes? No. NULL is as meaningful as any other value. If your queries are searching for null values using IS NULL, these queries might benefit from an index on NULL. So is this method beneficial only for null values? Using partial indexes to exclude values that are not queried very often or not at all can be beneficial for any value, not just null values. NULL usually indicate a lack of value, and in our case not many queries were searching for null values, so it made sense to exclude them from the index. So how did you end up clearing more than 20GB? You may have noticed that the title mentions more than 20GB of free space but the charts only show half, well... indexes are also dropped from replications! When you release 10GB from your primary database, you also release roughly the same amount of storage from each replica. Bonus: Migrating with Django ORM This story is taken from a large application built with Django. To put the above techniques to practice with Django, there are several things to note. Prevent Implicit Creation of Indexes on Foreign Keys Unless you explicitly set db_index=False, Django will implicitly create a B-Tree index on a models.ForeignKey field. Consider the following example: from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User class Transaction(models.Model): # ... cancelled_by_user = models.ForeignKey( to=User, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE, ) The model is used to keep track of transaction data. If a transaction is cancelled, we keep a reference to user that cancelled it. As previously described, most transactions don't end up being cancelled, so we set null=True on the field. In the ForeignKey definition above we did not explicitly set db_index, so Django will implicitly create a full index on the field. To create a partial index instead, make the following changes: from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User class Transaction(models.Model): # ... cancelled_by_user = models.ForeignKey( to=User, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE, db_index=False, ) class Meta: indexes = ( models.Index( fields=('cancelled_by_user_id', ), name='%(class_name)s_cancelled_by_part_ix', condition=Q(cancelled_by_user_id__isnull=False), ), ) We first tell Django not to create the index on the FK field, and then add a partial index using models.Index. TAKE AWAY Nullable foreign keys are good candidates for a partial index! To prevent implicit features such as this one from sneaking indexes without us noticing, we create Django checks to force ourselves to always explicitly set db_index in foreign keys. Migrate Exiting Full Indexes to Partial Indexes One of the challenges we were facing during this migration is to replace the existing full indexes with partial indexes without causing downtime or degraded performance during the migration. After we identified the full indexes we want to replace, we took the following steps: Replace full indexes with partial indexes: Adjust the relevant Django models and replace full indexes with partial indexes, as demonstrated above. The migration Django generates will first disable the FK constraint (if the field is a foreign key), drop the existing full index and create the new partial index. Executing this migration may cause both downtime and degraded performance, so we won't actually run it. Create the partial indexes manually: Use Django's ./manage.py sqlmigrate utility to produce a script for the migration, extract only the CREATE INDEX statements and adjust them to create the indexes CONCURRENTLY. Then, create the indexes manually and concurrently in the database. Since the full indexes are not dropped yet, they can still be used by queries so performance should not be impacted in the process. It is possible to create indexes concurrently in Django migrations, but this time we decided it's best to do it manually. Reset full index statistics counters: To make sure it's safe to drop the full indexes, we wanted to first make sure the new partial indexes are being used. To keep track of their use we reset the counters for the full indexes using pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters(). Monitor use of partial indexes: After resetting the stats we monitored both overall query performance and the partial index usage by observing the values of idx_scan, idx_tup_read and idx_tup_fetch in the pg_stat_all_indexes tables, for both the partial and the full indexes. Drop the full indexes: Once we were convinced the partial indexes are being used, we dropped the full indexes. This is a good point to check the sizes of both partial and full indexes to find out exactly how much storage you are about to free. Fake the Django migration: Once the database state was effectively in-sync with the model state, we fake the migration using ./manage.py migrate --fake. When faking a migration, Django will register the migration as executed, but it won't actually execute anything. This is useful for situations like this when you need better control over a migration process. Note that on other environments such as dev, QA or staging where there is not downtime considerations, the Django migrations will execute normally and the full indexes will be replaced with the partial ones. For more advanced Django migration operations such as \"fake\", check out How to Move a Django Model to Another App. Conclusion Optimizing disks, storage parameters and configuration can only affect performance so much. At some point, to squeeze that final drop of performance you need to make changes to the underlying objects. In this case, it was the index definition. To sum up the process we took to clear an much storage as we could: Remove unused indexes Repack tables and indexes (and activate B-Tree deduplication when possible) Utilize partial indexes to index only what's necessary Hopefully, after applying these techniques you can gain a few more days before you need to reach into your pocket and provision more storage.

However as someone who runs TB of databases, \"just provision more storage\" is always a valid option. Especially if you are outside the cloud.

You&#x27;re not buying just that 1 TB. You probably want at least two live failover servers at least, maybe more.

So, if you keep solving problems by growing the system, overall, the system will become more and more \"sluggish\" until it becomes unserviceable.On the other hand, solutions which minimize the number of system resources necessary to accomplish a task increase overall performance per unit.

Saving this one for reference!One minor \"word to the wise\", cause I thought this was a great post but also has the potential to be misused: if you work at a startup or early stage company, it is nearly always the better decision to throw more disk space at a storage problem like this than worry about optimizing for size. Developers are expensive, disk space is cheap. reply nico 17 hours agoparent> if you work at a startup or early stage company, it is nearly always the better decision to throw more disk space at a storage problem like this than worry about optimizing for size. Developers are expensive, disk space is cheapThis is great advice. In general at the beginning it is better to keep things as simple as possible.At one fast growing startup I worked at, one of the founders insisted we kept upgrading just one machine (plus redundancy and backups). It was a great strategy! Kept the architecture super simple, easy to manage, easy to debug and recover. For the first 5 years of the company, the whole thing ran on one server, while growing exponentially and serving millions of users globally.After seeing that, it’s clear to me you should only upgrade when needed, and in the simplest, most straightforward way possible. reply jtc331 12 hours agoparentprevThere’s a lot of emphasis here about just adding storage, but that’s missing the fact that unnecessary indexing affects writes and reads performance also (and potentially quite significantly).Using a partial index where it’s obviously matches the use case (like when a majority of values are null) is just correct modeling and should not be considered a premature optimization or waste or developer time. reply lmm 8 hours agorootparent> There’s a lot of emphasis here about just adding storage, but that’s missing the fact that unnecessary indexing affects writes and reads performance also (and potentially quite significantly).Again, for a startup or early stage company, spending developer time on read and write performance is almost certainly a waste.

The worst offender was a 17GB (of data) table that had 142GB of indexes. Reindex took it down to 21GB. The table indexing is crazy and has multiple indexes over different sets of columns.A contributing factor for the huge index I think was the distribution of data. It&#x27;s had inserts, updates and deletes continuously since 2015. Data is more likely to be deleted the older it gets so there&#x27;s more data from recent years, but about 0.1% of the data is still from 2015.

How so? Reading values that aren&#x27;t included in the index require following a reference back to the table row.

The moment I told my mom this fact she stopped having them.* The \"problem\" with suggesting Braille is that it requires an acceptance that one has lost their eyesight for good, which is a difficult step for many. So audio solutions could be better in the short term. The same goes for training for how to move around using a white cane.* iPhones have a feature called VoiceOver that lets you use your phone without looking. My mom never really got the hang of it too much, but she definitely uses Siri a lot. Android has something too, but last time I checked it was not as good. Being able to take short and long notes (voice notes, small recorder, whatever works) should be a priority.* If you install a screen reader, I encourage you to use a Linux laptop. Windows has a tendency to move things around for no good reason (and God have mercy if your OS auto-updates), which breaks my mom&#x27;s muscle memory of how to open this or that program.* Audiobooks: I typically convert EPUB&#x2F;MOBI books with Calibre to DOCX, put them in a shared folder, and she uses the screen reader to hear them. I also use the same shared folder to download podcasts. Alexa didn&#x27;t work well here at all, but that&#x27;s because Alexa in South America sucks. Your case may be different.* Be ready to curse whenever some clueless news anchor talks about a \"miracle bionic eye\" while praying that your mom doesn&#x27;t hear about it. Having to be the one who&#x27;s constantly shooting down someone&#x27;s last hope is not cool.I submitted a similar question here 8 years ago.

My grandmother learned braille at 72 and it changed her life - she never got into audio books, and I think she also appreciated the community of her local braille library. She also had a braille reader which attached to a console and worked surprisingly well - perhaps ironically she became much more technically capable and comfortable after losing her sight. She used that to write and read email in pine (I set that up for her in the early 2000’s, I’m sure better options exist now.)My uncles who’ve lost their sight both picked up braille early and have barely skipped a beat. I believe learning and leveraging braille while partially sighted both made it easier to adapt and mitigated the emotional impact of their loss as it progressed.There are other advances in tactile displays happening every day now, one which I’ve been following is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.dotincorp.com&#x2F;.PS.

Her vision in the time I&#x27;ve known her (about 7 years) had declined significantly. (She&#x27;s now about 77.) She could drive during the day in good conditions locally a few years ago but has given up driving entirely in the past 18 months.She still has some vision but would be legally blind at this point, I believe.A few years ago we bought her an iPad which has some assistive technologies (e.g., magnifier) that she says have helped her immensely. (She has an Android and prefers that but the iPad has been the best option for a tablet.) I realize \"buy an iPad\" is pretty basic, but it really seems to have made a difference.She also uses an app that magnifies print, etc., via the iPad camera. We also got a \"3-in-1 craft lamp\" that has a clamp, light, and magnifying glass with a light[1].

Plan for this and encourage her to develop a process now for accommodating this new reality.Giving up too quickly and not having a comfortable process for this can make a disability much more impairing than it really needs to be. Expect to need to introduce an idea or technology and give her time to get around to it. Expect to remind her \"You could do just the first step on that.\" or \"You could do just the next step on that.\"People who have been able-bodied are somewhat inclined to not persist when things start taking more time and effort to incorporate.

Does anyone have recommendations for learners and amateur (family) trainers?To the OP: I’ve been in a similar situation with my mother. Unfortunately her loss of eyesight happened so suddenly that we weren’t able to follow the excellent advice to get her started on the technology adaptation before her eyesight (mostly) went.I’m hoping that our negative experiences here can be a warning to others. The primary lesson is this:Apple products, especially the iPhone, have the best accessibility features for vision-impaired users. Unfortunately, getting fluent with those features requires lots of time and training. If your mother isn’t able to reach that fluency, she may end up not using the devices for more than a couple of basic tasks.I recommend finding videos of experienced people with impaired vision using their iPhones, because it’s quite amazing: they can feel their way around the UI with tactile feedback, and read via text-to-speech that’s often running so fast that it sounds like brief bursts of noise if you aren’t used to it. We’re used to Apple devices being super-constrained in customizability, but the Accessibility settings provide far more flexibility than the rest of the UI settings. (This is a double-edged sword, which I’ll get to.)We were hoping to give my mother that ease of use with her phone, but first we had to move her to a new iPhone from an old Samsung. We (her family) were very time and energy constrained, so didn’t complete the first and most basic step: moving her fully from one phone to the other. This meant that she kept using the Samsung by default, and effectively got no experience with the iPhone.Even with the iPhone in hand, there’s a bigger problem: no obvious route to go from a standing start to a trained-up user. I found very few good guides to using the low-vision features, and even when I had them, I didn’t know how to start training my mother. The double-edged sword I mentioned earlier is that the Accessibility settings are copious and complex, and if you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s easy to accidentally switch the device into a usage mode that’s hard to understand and even harder to turn off.If your mother is sufficiently motivated and downright brave enough to experiment with the settings and learn them for herself, it _might_ be possible. But I can see a hundred reasons why that might not be the case. Modern technology is terrifying enough for seniors as it is.

It&#x27;s beyond scary.The problem with going blind is that vision is much more deeply tied to our everyday experience. Losing it is like living in mud; it constantly reminds you of your degeneration. Every movement and many interactions require it. If you&#x27;re also losing hearing, it interferes with lip reading. It&#x27;s very emotional.The problem with not reading is that you may lose your daily pattern of input, the habits that orient your mind.The problem with helping an elderly parent is that you respect them and want them to be happy and to be happy with you. You really, really don&#x27;t want to get them upset, because when they get upset with you, they&#x27;re cut off from the support you provide.The problem with getting help from your children is that you&#x27;ve always been the helper. You may see them as accomplished adults, but still feel you need to be there for them, and guide them. Often in parenting you just have to decide, and then make it stick - any consistency is better than none.The problem is these problems amplify each other. The elderly find it hard to be wrong, and needy, and confused, and feeling like you can&#x27;t learn new things because you&#x27;re only getting worse. If you try something and you can&#x27;t do it, it can make your mom double down on depression and denial, to wait out death. For people helping, all this emotional work can make you avoidant, offering only nominal support.It was a real moment when I explained all this to my mom. Denial, depression, death-panic, avoidance -- these are all normal and even expected. But she like all humans has to deal with her actual limitations. It will take time and effort, and I will help, with her guidance on how fast and what&#x27;s feasible. The most important thing was for her to know I would help, and wanted to hear what she&#x27;s feeling. Committing to being there addresses most of the problems.In terms of tricks&#x2F;solutions, a regular phone call is huge. She gathers her issues and we discuss them, or just keep tabs on the world. Migrating interaction to audio and voice was more helpful than trying to maintain reading in our case.btw: someone at Apple TV needs to deeply grok that barely enlarging the selected item is completely unhelpful to older adults. Draw a bright highlight around the damn icons! It&#x27;s hard to explain how aggravating it feels when trying to help someone elderly pick their damn show and they have no clue what&#x27;s happening on-screen -- let alone having to wade through media upsells. reply mwtheobald 19 hours agoprevMy family has a genetic disorder very similar to Stargardts disease which is a form of macular degeneration (loss of central vision).

The Central Scrutinizer connects to an Apple M1 or M2 machine over USB-C, and exposes the integrated low-level serial port over a USB connection. It is also capable of performing a hard-reboot of the machine if you've crashed it. Finally, it offers a USB2.0 pass-through that can be used to boot the machine over USB using the m1n1 bootloader that is part of the Asahi project. It provides a low-level debugging port to operating system developers, which is useful when you cannot count on a display to be available, or need to log information but can't use any storage. If you're using MacOS on your Apple Silicon machine, you probably don't need this tool. If you're using an alternative operating system on this machine (Linux, OpenBSD...), but never do any bare-metal debugging, you probably don't need it either. Note that the Central Scrutinizer board is not a stand-alone equipment. You will need to solder a Raspberry-Pi Pico to it, and flash some firmware on it to make it usable. I am NOT providing the Pico. If you want a fully built device, please get in touch. Why did you make it? I'm a Linux kernel developer, mostly working on the arm64 port. I find that debugging low-level code is greatly helped by having such a low-level tool. It also mean that I can stack these machines without having any screen or keyboard attached to them. Note that this isn't a BMC. It really only exposes a USB serial port with some added goodies. It could complement a BMC though, and be used in an environment that requires direct console access. Notes Both the hardware and software are open-source. You are welcome to build your own and contribute! I have a small number of v2 boards that are available at a discounted price. They are perfectly functional, just requiring a fully fledged USB-C cable. Please get in touch if would rather get one of those. I can also assemble it with a Pico, flash and test the device. Get in touch if you'd rather get a fully assembled device. Specs and Docs Source Code Design Files Shipping Info No country selected, please select your country to see shipping options.

Some variation of this feature has existed in all Macs since the earliest ones that supported software-based power control (~1990s era).

The litany of lawsuits allege that 3M knew its earplugs—standard issue for soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2003 and 2015—were too short and didn’t form a proper seal to prevent inner ear damage. They also charge that the company failed warn the US government or users, or take steps to fix the product. Without this settlement, the maker of Post-It Notes and Scotch Tape was looking at upward of $9.5 billion in potential liability from the defective earplug lawsuits, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. A brief timeline of 3M’s combat earplugs lawsuits April 2008: 3M buys personal protective equipment maker Aearo Technologies. May 2016: A whistleblower suit accuses 3M of selling “dangerously defective” earplugs. July 2018: 3M agrees to pay $9.1 million to resolve allegations that it knowingly sold the less-than-effective earplugs to the US military “without disclosing defects that hampered the effectiveness of the hearing protection device,” according to the US Department of Justice. April 2019: The 3M defective earplug cases are consolidated in multi-district litigation before a federal judge in Florida. July 2022: In an effort to contain fallout from the cases, 3M tries to get Aearo Technologies to file for bankruptcy. June 2023: A bankruptcy judge tosses out Aearo’s case, saying the bankruptcy filing was “fatally premature” because 3M faced no financial insecurity due to the numerous earplug lawsuits. The company appeals. 3M settlement of interest: PFOA and PFAS, or “forever chemicals” It’s been a summer of settlements for 3M. In June, the company agreed to pay at least $10.3 billion over the next 13 years to settle current and future claims over dumping so-called “forever chemicals”—the colloquial term for man-made chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFAS)—in drinking water systems across the US. With the deal, the industrial giant resolved a number of cases, including a trial that was delayed at the last moment as settlement talks wrapped up. 3M, which invented the chemical C8—the PFOA named after its eight-carbon chain structure, infamously used in Teflon non-stick—in 1947 and manufactured it until 2000, isn’t done with PFAS-related lawsuits. It faces a spate of them, including those filed by individuals with personal injury and property damage claims. Others are by US states over harm to natural resources such as rivers and lakes, damage that wasn’t accounted for in the June settlement. 3M’s faulty combat earplugs lawsuits, by the digits 6.1%: 3M’s stock bump in premarket trading Monday (Aug. 28) on the news of the settlement 10 out of 16: Early trials over the earplugs that 3M has lost so far $265 million: Total awarded to 13 plaintiffs who have sued over the earplugs to date 971,990: Tinnitus claims lodged with the US Veterans Administration in 2012, according to government records 336,995: Lawsuits filed as of June 15, 2023, according to the US Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.

Unless someone here has more sources?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;maryroeloffs&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;3m-may-... reply mkmk 14 hours agoparent> Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to warn or instruct of the following risks and dangers of using the CAEv2 as intended: (1) that the CAEv2 loosens imperceptibly in a user’s ears, thereby allowing damaging sounds to bypass the earplug and enter the ear; (2) that Aearo’s testing subjects did not follow standard fitting instructions, but rather used a reconfigured method of folding back the opposing flanges before inserting the device into their ears; (3) that following Defendants’ standard instructions for insertion of the CAEv2 would not achieve the 22 Noise Reduction Rating and would thereby pose a serious risk to users; and (4) that Defendants did not adequately or properly test the CAEv2.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govinfo.gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;USCOURTS-flnd-3_19-md-02... reply TylerE 13 hours agorootparentWow, I had no idea they were that bad. 22NRR for guns at close range is...not much. Most range shooters will be using at least 30+ (which is WAY MORE than ~40% effective - decibels are logarithmic). Some will even wear 30+ plugs under 35+ muffs. (Which don&#x27;t add, btw, again, logarithms, but doubling up does get you a few extra decibels reduction over either component alone. reply kazinator 13 hours agorootparentYes, it should add! If we cascade a 30 dB reduction with another 30 dB reduction, we should get 60 dB reduction.The only reason you likely won&#x27;t get anywhere near 60 dB from a combination of plugs and muffs has nothing to do with logarithms, but with physics&#x2F;topology.Namely, the reason why these devices have the rating they do and not something better is not only that sounds goes through them but that it goes around them, e.g. through your skull or Eustachian tube or whatever.When signal is leaking around the attenuators, then their decibel reductions cannot simply add. Even if the attenuators completely block signal, they will be bypassed, and so the best decibel reduction is limited by the floor of the bypassing signal.But decibels definitely add. E.g. in an electronic circuit where we have vanishingly low leakage around our attenuation stages, if we cascade a -6 dB drop with a -12 dB drop we will get -18 dB. Now suppose we have a parasitic leakage from input to output so that even if we disconnect our circuits signal path, some input still reaches the output: say -100 dB. It might be going through ground wires, or inductive or capacitive cross-talk between circuit traces or whatever. That then sets the upper bound on our attenuation; we will not be able to attenuate better than -100 dB, because then the leakage dominates.I mentioned the Eustachian tube. If your ears are stuffed to heck and you have muffs over that, and then yawn with an open mouth, you may suddenly hear a lot more noise. Oops! reply TylerE 12 hours agorootparentNo, because decibles are logarithmic.30db + 30db = 33dbhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noisemeters.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;db-calculator&#x2F;With hearing protection the ratings are in isolation. They are not circuit components that work serially. Sound transmits through the skull physically. reply kazinator 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m afraid are seriously misunderstanding what that calculator is for.In this calculator, whenever you add any equal decibel values X, you get X + X = X + 3: three more decibels.There is a familiar meaning behind that: it means that if we have two independent noise sources of about equal intensity, and add them together, the result is 3dB more intense.E.g. if we have a loudspeaker playing white noise, and add an identical loudspeaker playing the same kind of of white noise at the same level, we get 3dB more white noise.It has nothing to do with cascaded boosts or attenuations.If we add together two sources that contain the same signal, in phase, then the rule is 6 dB. Like two identical loudspeakers in a cabinet instead of one, playing exactly the same signal.The reason we can add decibels for cascaded attenuations and boosts is exactly the same reason why we can add displacements on a slide rule to do multiplication. Attenuations (such as a voltage divider) multiply the signal. E.g. multiplying by 1&#x2F;2 is -6db.In the logarithmic space, multiplication turns to addition. This is typically covered in high school.> They are not circuit components that work serially.That&#x27;s true, but I addressed in it my comment (with several redundant remarks) in such a way that the above remark doesn&#x27;t add more clarity. I have a sneaking suspicion you might not have read it in detail. reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan 9 hours agorootparent> ... is exactly the same reason why we can add displacements on a slide rule ...I know this analogy was intended to help understanding, but I&#x27;m curious - are most people actually familiar with slide rules work?Just for reference: I&#x27;m an engineer in my mid thirties, and I know what a slide rule is, and might even be able to correctly identify the object if it were placed in front of me, but I&#x27;ve never actually seen one (let alone used one), so the analogy you&#x27;ve made is meaningless to me. My girlfriend who&#x27;s a few years younger than me and also works in tech is vaguely familiar with the concept of the device but had never heard of the term \"slide rule\". My father is also an engineer and only used one for one class when he was in high school. reply javajosh 12 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps it would be helpful to consider the path of a phonon going through a barrier. The odds of that phonon making it through is 1 chance in N. If there are two barriers, the odds of a phonon making it through both in series is 1 chance in N^2. That is, the odds multiply, and you are absolutely correct that dB&#x27;s add (since they are basically log(N) in this case and log(N^2) = 2log(N)). reply sp332 12 hours agorootparentprevBut physically, if you put a 30 db noise reducer behind another 30 db noise reducer, you will get 60 db noise reduction overall. reply kazinator 12 hours agorootparentI predict that TylerE will not believe you. reply TylerE 12 hours agorootparentNeither does osha. They spec that when earring muffs and plugs the effective rating is the higher rated product +5db. reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentThat’s likely due to sound conduction through your body. An isolated box inside another isolated box can reach well past +5db of improvement.This is how you can deal with truly extreme sounds like rocket launches and bomb tests.There’s some edge cases as distance doesn’t stack well with distance, but distance does stack well with ear protection. reply TylerE 11 hours agorootparentThat’s my entire point! You have to consider the entire system and not isolated components. reply kazinator 10 hours agorootparentOr, well, that&#x27;s my point that you&#x27;re trying to hijack as yours. Part of my point: that and that decibels do actually add, but you have to know the limitations. reply thghtihadanacct 9 hours agorootparentThis sounds like an engineering student arguing with an old tech... &#x27;but the science says ...&#x27;. How do people forget we live in an uncontained system with uncountable variables and no single direction? reply TylerE 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a very bad faith interpretation, especially considering your first post in this thread was...a reply to mine. reply aidenn0 6 hours agorootparentMy reading of the comment that kazinator replied to was that the dB ratings don&#x27;t add because of logarithms. Kazinator&#x27;s reply was that logarithms add just fine, but flanking noise dominates. replykazinator 12 hours agorootparentprevNote that this estimate disagrees with the wholly inappropriate calculator you cited, which will never produce a value exceeding the higher value by more than 3 dB.OSHA almost certainly had to empirically determine the estimate, either with a real human head, a fake one, or some numerical model or something. reply TylerE 11 hours agorootparentIt disagrees with me (2db) a lot less than it disagrees with you. (25db). reply kazinator 10 hours agorootparentI have no idea what you&#x27;re referring to; I have not given any estimate, only posited that it will be far short of the naive sum of 60 db. I have an even sneakier suspicion than before that you only read one sentence of my original comment, but don&#x27;t let that stop you! replyTylerE 12 hours agorootparentprevBut you can’t!Sound waves have many paths to the eardrum and related tiny bones. reply marcosdumay 12 hours agorootparentprevAttenuation is multiplicative. reply TylerE 12 hours agorootparentIf you are attnuating 100% of the signal, yes. That is very much not the case with earplugs. reply thghtihadanacct 9 hours agorootparentnegative, shock waves from sound will travel through your person and reach your cute little ear plugs from the back side.

A bit of ear wax, a bit of sweat, a swallow, etc nudge them just enough to break the seal. Since they&#x27;re a fully sealed earplug, it&#x27;s obvious when they shift and I push them back in. I could only imagine how frustrating that shifting would be in combat with these. reply 1970-01-01 15 hours agoparentprevIt sounds like (pun intended) one side of them was not working as described. The green end was designed to block out all sound. The yellow end, signaling “whisper mode,” purported to block out loud sound — but allowed the user to hear quieter noises, like conversations.My source is hear (hah):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;3m-legal-battle-combat-grade... reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparentThanks for that. A lot of interesting details:> “The purpose of the creation of [the Combat Arms earplugs] was to collaborate with the military to solve one of the longest-standing problems they have had, that soldiers won’t wear their hearing protection around loud noises and in combat,” Rucker said.> Rucker said the plugs were designed in collaboration with the U.S. military and tested by the Air Force, Army, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and others.> “3M has purposefully skewed this data by relying on hearing standards that do not measure frequencies most affected by noise, concealing the hearing damage suffered by veterans,” said Bryan Aylstock and Chris Seeger, co-lead counsel for the service members and veterans, in a joint statement.> 3M disagreed with those claims, telling CNBC: “The data support what 3M has maintained throughout this litigation: the Combat Arms Earplugs version two were safe and effective to use. This has been confirmed by every independent, third-party organization that has tested the product, including the Army Research Lab, the Air Force Research lab, NIOSH, and others.”Ultimately, whose job should it be to determine whether or not they&#x27;re defective? If the military tested them in advance and determined they met standards, and they were manufactured identically to what the military approved, should 3M be the one held responsible? reply Nition 11 hours agorootparent> soldiers won’t wear their hearing protection around loud noises and in combatI haven&#x27;t been in combat, thankfully, but I assume the problem is that you also want to hear quiet sounds clearly, and others around you talking etc?In the audio world we would fix this with a compressor or a limiter. You set a loudness threshold and then reduce the component of the audio input that&#x27;s above that threshold in volume by a fixed ratio, e.g. 4:1. A limiter is the same but the ratio is infinite (or near it), so the threshold becomes the maximum loudness. Basically, reduce the dynamic range.I wonder how much it would cost to have active processing like that integrated into hearing protection. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve thought of it.Or maybe I&#x27;m thinking too fancy - maybe you could achieve the same thing without electronics. Loud sounds are just more pressure after all... could we have a little hole that&#x27;s open in normal conditions but loud sounds push it closed?I know this is probably one of those things where \"random idiot on hacker news thinks he has a new idea that we&#x27;ve of course already researched thoroughly in the industry\" but if these exit it&#x27;d be cool to see, or if they don&#x27;t it&#x27;d be cool to know why. reply AuryGlenz 4 hours agorootparentYeah, that’s absolutely already a thing for regular Joe Schmoe hearing protection. I have a pair. They’re big earmuff types though, not earplugs. I suppose they very well might exist now too.The fun thing about them is you can turn up the volume and essentially have super hearing while still keeping gun shots quiet. reply Nition 1 hour agorootparentWould you mind sharing the brand? I&#x27;d just like to look them up out of interest. reply jiaaro 10 hours agorootparentprevI’m not an industry expert either, but ear plugs don’t block sound taking other paths to the ear drum like bone conduction. The mix knob on this limiter can’t be turned to 100% reply hyperhello 14 hours agorootparentprevIf all of that is true, it’s arbitrary whether 3M is part of the military or not, and can be held responsible. reply remarkEon 10 hours agorootparentprevI was in the Army for a while and used these all the time. I had no idea that the yellow vs green end was for different sound levels, wow. reply delta-26 6 hours agoparentprevIt’s worse: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prospect.org&#x2F;power&#x2F;monopoly-misrepresentation-and-ma... reply killingtime74 14 hours agoparentprevI think you can take it from their settlement that they think they have some reasonable chances of losing. Fighting a lawsuit you are likely to win only costs a fraction of this amount. reply iramiller 15 hours agoprevI’ve used the shaped orange foam 3M ear plugs extensively while riding a motorcycle. The wind noise is extremely bad for you given the duration and surprisingly high decibels.One interesting thing I have noticed is that these plugs are extremely sensitive to being inserted correctly and despite extensive experience and good technique (which for me involves two hands, one to insert and one to pull the top of my ear for alignment) I still find the need to reinsert plugs on occasion.Unfortunately the poor fit isn’t obvious until I am on the road at speed when the sound volume is higher than it should be. If this same situation arises in combat I can easily imagine that the higher intensity of noises would cause hearing damage far sooner and in addition it seems unlikely soldiers would call for a timeout to fix their ear plugs. reply dharmab 15 hours agoparentI switched from the 3M plugs to Pinlock plugs for most riding. The Pinlock ones are suitable for around town, twisties and short highway runs, but allow me to hear engines, sirens, conversations, etc. They slide in easily with a little water. I still use the foamies for long road trips. reply Reubachi 14 hours agorootparentTangential but using water (which critically is not the same as sweat) to get earplugs in regularly would cause your doctor to have an annuerism.I&#x27;m legit interested in this because I chase constant ear infections from needing to put in earbuds&#x2F;plugs right after showering for my routine&#x2F;work flow.Have you ever had an issue? reply function_seven 14 hours agorootparentI used to use water all the time to slide earplugs in, and never had any issues with ear infections. But I always had a nagging voice inside my head telling me it wasn’t a good idea.Did I get lucky? Or maybe I’m just less susceptible to infections? I always made sure the water was clean, but I suppose if there were bacteria on the outer surface of my ear, the water would carry it inward easier than a dry fitting would? reply m00x 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s luck, and maybe genetic thing.Water cleanliness doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything, bacteria is everywhere. Some scuba divers with the same technique get infections often, some don&#x27;t (with same techniques). I got an infection on my first dive, then nothing ever again. Some get them every 6-7 dives. reply avar 13 hours agorootparent> Water cleanliness doesn&#x27;t matter, bacteria is everywhere[...]It matters a lot, I&#x27;ve dived extensively, and the only time I&#x27;ve gotten an ear infection was in Indonesia, likely polluted runoff water contributed to that.You&#x27;ll find scientific articles backing that up, i.e. infections in general go up when swimming in untreated sewage&#x2F;runoff, including ear infections. reply m00x 12 hours agorootparentI miswrote that. Water cleanliness matters, but it doesn&#x27;t guarantee a lack of infection.Sorry for the confusion. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentprevWhere in Indonesia? reply swores 14 hours agorootparentprevIs it worse than having a bath where your ears go under water or a shower where water splashes into ears? Isn&#x27;t that something many people do daily? reply ketzo 13 hours agorootparentAfter a bath or shower, your ears are open to the air, and the water can evaporate.The earplugs keep the water sealed in your inner ear for a long time where it can&#x27;t dry, increasing the chance of infection.Some people do just get more frequent ear infections than others, though, from swimming or even just daily showers&#x2F;baths. That gets back to the luck&#x2F;genetics thing. reply sokoloff 13 hours agorootparentprevDiving has total saturation and additional pressure driving the water deeper than water splashed at 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure.Combat (or riding or flying) has longer duration of dampness than getting out of a bath&#x2F;shower and going about your normal routine. reply dharmab 13 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t take much. I just run them under the tap and flick most of the water off. It helps form a seal and then dries off.

Windshields can actually make it worse, depending on airflow - turbulent air coming over the top and around the sides of the windshield is louder than clean smooth air. Windshields do more for fatigue, weather protection and aerodynamics.I wear hearing aids due to motorcycle-related hearing loss, and I have never worn anything less than a full helmet. reply infecto 14 hours agorootparentprevThat just does not work unless you have bubble around your whole body and I bet even then it’s sufficiently loud.Unless you find the perfect windscreen, most have lots of buffeting and it’s actually quite hard to dial it in perfectly.Helmets do absolutely zero to block noises.Edit: just to add. I think it stands. The helmet does not block any sound. It may be aero dynamic enough that it helps prevent additional wind noise but it’s not blocking sound. Ear pro all the time. reply m00x 14 hours agorootparentIt depends on the helmet and speed.

It’s your ears and you can decide for yourself but even if it does not sound loud, over the course of a ride it can still be high enough to slowly cause damage.To me it’s the same kind of argument of friends who would say it’s ok to shoot shotguns without ear pro. Sure it can be done but it adds up. reply m00x 12 hours agorootparentMaybe I don&#x27;t ride enough for it to be an issue, but my hearing is top notch for a 35 year old.I got tested and I&#x27;m at 20 y old levels of sensitivity. reply infecto 11 hours agorootparentAnd I don’t mean this the wrong way. Your experience is anecdotal. Maybe you ride in a city and slow speeds, maybe you have a windscreen that actually does decent job of creating a bubble over you, maybe you don’t ride for extended periods of time. Too many variables to account for. For the population though, ear pro is recommended for Motorsports. I had a bike once that caused buffeting from the hand guards. It might work for you but generally does not work for many. reply dharmab 13 hours agorootparentprevIf your Arai has the wind deflector in you are giving yourself oxygen deprivation at every stoplight. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;x_ej8sehs8k?si=9LtvP0TfhQzgNDVM reply m00x 12 hours agorootparentNever been an issue, and I&#x27;m susceptible to oxygen deprivation being a big guy with weak lungs.I get dizzy in crowds, but never while riding. reply post_break 14 hours agorootparentprevMy Shoei RF 1400 was extremely quiet.

To quote myself:\"A fourth hypothesis is that the relationship between voice concerns, hearing difficulties, and TTS arises from the trade-offs of wearing hearing protection in high-level noise environments. The use of hearing protection presents a challenge when selecting an appropriate vocal loudness level for effective communication (Brungart et al., 2012; Vaziri, 2018). In particular, individuals who wear hearing protection in high-noise environments tend to speak quietly, making them difficult to understand. People may overcompensate by talking too loudly (placing their vocal health at risk) or by removing their hearing protection so they can communicate more effectively (thus increasing TTS and placing their hearing at risk).\" reply exabrial 12 hours agoprevThe vast majority of vets I&#x27;ve heard talk about this admit they never actually used the ear plugs in combat... basically when things start happening they weren&#x27;t reaching for earplugs... The real problem is the military provided no _practical_ combat hearing protection at all for the longest time. reply warner25 11 hours agoparentYeah, one of the problems with combat is that it&#x27;s unpredictable. Over much of the last 20 years, we (American troops) rarely had the initiative. Instead we sat, drove, or walked around essentially waiting to get attacked. Deliberate raids were done almost exclusively by a small cadre of Special Operations folks. So the choice was to wear hearing protection all the time, which seems unreasonable[1], or not be wearing it at all when a rocket or mortar randomly impacted or a car bomb exploded nearby or a fight broke out.Of course, I&#x27;d also bet that most people didn&#x27;t have their hearing damaged \"in combat\" because most people didn&#x27;t see combat, or certainly didn&#x27;t see much of it. I would bet that most damage was done on live-fire ranges in training, where we have whole days of rounds popping off, or working around aircraft, where there&#x27;s no excuse for not wearing hearing protection.[1] Although we eventually mandated eye protection whenever people were outdoors in Afghanistan.

Take the veteran incidence of hearing less divided by the population level incidence of hearing loss and see if that ratio went up after the introduction of 3M earbuds? And if there’s a significant change there then it’s likely that the earbuds were defective by design or there were manufacturing issues. At that point everyone who was exposed to that phenomenon DOES deserve the payout, as there’s a plausible risk that the earbuds worsened it. reply autoexec 12 hours agorootparentprevI suspect there&#x27;ll also be a ton of people who suffer from hearing damage because 3M hid the truth about their faulty product but who never join a class action, and that for many (if not most) who do try to get compensation whatever \"payout\" they get will be nothing compared to what they&#x27;ve lost.Hearing loss is probably something most of us will deal with at some point, and I&#x27;ve spoken to a lot of people who are already dealing with it and every one of them wishes they&#x27;d had more time with good hearing.

Roll the earplug to compress it (similar to if you&#x27;ve ever made a snake out of play-dough). Most people do this properly but some people just immediately try to jam the earplugs in while they&#x27;re flaccid, which prevents them from inserting very far.2. While inserting the earplug, use your opposite hand to pull on your ear (eg use your left hand over your head to yank your right ear up a bit). This helps line up your ear canal. Most people don&#x27;t do this3. Hold the earplug in place for 10-30 seconds, so that the foam you compressed in step 1 has time to reexpand and lock in. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen someone actually do this step.IMO the move for new shooters (especially indoors, where IMO it&#x27;s a good idea for everyone) is to double up on ear pro. Use ear plugs in addition to muffs (bonus points for ANC muffs with amplification, so you don&#x27;t have to shout).
