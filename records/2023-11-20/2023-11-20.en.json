There&#x27;s a thin possibility that Microsoft would have to write-off its whole $10B (or more?) investment in OpenAI, but that isn&#x27;t Satya&#x27;s focus. The focus is on what he can do next. Maybe, recruit the most formidable AI team in the world, removed from the shackles of an awkward non-profit owning a for-profit company? Give enough (cash) incentives and most of OpenAI employees would have no qualms about following Sam and Greg. It will take time for sure, but Microsoft can now capture even a bigger slice of THE FUTURE than it was possible with OpenAI investment. reply 9dev 1 hour agoparentI don’t quite buy your Cyberpunk utopia where the Megacorp finally rids us of those pesky ethics qualms (or ”shackles“, as you phrased it.) Microsoft can now proceed without the guidance of a council that actually has humanities interests in mind, not only those of Microsoft shareholders. I don’t know whether all that caution will turn out to have been necessary, but I guess we’re just gleefully heading into whatever lies ahead without any concern whatsoever, and learn it the hard way.It’s a bit tragic that Ilya and company achieved the exact opposite of what they intended apparently, by driving those they attempted to slow down into the arms of people with more money and less morals. Well. reply TerrifiedMouse 4 minutes agorootparent> It’s a bit tragic that Ilya and company achieved the exact opposite of what they intended apparently, by driving those they attempted to slow down into the arms of people with more money and less morals. Well.If they didn’t fire him, Altman will just continue to run hog wild over their charter. In that sense they lose either way.At least this way, OpenAI can continue to operate independently instead as Microsoft’s zombie vassal company with their mole Altman pulling the strings. reply shubhamjain 58 minutes agorootparentprevI am not claiming how right or wrong the final outcome would be, but owning the technology with a clear \"for-profit\" objective is definitely a better structure for Microsoft and for Sam Altman as well (considering, his plans for the future). I have no opinion on AI risk. I just think that a super valuable technology under a non-profit objective was simply an untenable structure, regardless of potential threats. reply 9dev 53 minutes agorootparentThis is precisely the problem OpenAI aimed to solve: This technology cannot be treated independently of the potential risks involved.I agree that this solution seems beneficial for both Microsoft and Sam Altman, but it reflects poorly on society if we simply accept this version of the story without criticism. reply disgruntledphd2 6 minutes agorootparentYeah but this was caused by the OpenAI board when they fired him. I mean, what did they think was going to happen?Seems like a textbook case of letting the best be the enemy of the good. reply slg 46 minutes agorootparentprevIt isn&#x27;t fear of a sentient AI that enslaves humanity that makes me disappointed with for-profit companies getting a stronger grip on this tech. It is the fear that a greater portion of the value of this technology will go to the stockholders of said companies rather than potentially be shared among a larger percentage of society. Not that I had that much faith in OpenAI, but in general the shift from non-profit to for-profit is a win for the few over the many. reply two_in_one 0 minutes agorootparentEven if it goes to stockholders it&#x27;s not lost forever. That&#x27;s how we got Starship. The question is what they do with it. As for &#x27;sharing&#x27;, we&#x27;ve seen that. In USSR it ended up with Putin, Lukashenko, turkmenbashi, and so on. In others it&#x27;s not much better. Europe is slowly falling behind. There should be some balance and culture. xapata 43 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;m a Microsoft shareholder. So is basically everyone else who invests in broad index funds, even if indirectly, through a pension fund. That&#x27;s \"many\" enough for me. reply slg 25 minutes agorootparentThe top 1% own over half of all stocks and the top 10% own nearly 90% so it really isn&#x27;t that \"many\". And you know what other companies are in those index funds you own, Microsoft&#x27;s competitors and customers that would both be squeezed if Microsoft gains a monopoly on some hypothetical super valuable AI tech. If Microsoft suddenly doubled in value, you would barely notice it in your 401k. reply bergen 12 minutes agorootparentprev\"Why don&#x27;t they just buy stock\"? Marie Antoinette or something reply ssnistfajen 28 minutes agorootparentprevMost Microsoft products have miserable UX because of this enabling mentality.

Microsoft or Google did not create ChatGPT because internally there would have been too many rules, too many cooks, red tape, etc., to do such a bold--and incautionary--thing as to use the entirety of the Internet as the training set, copyright law be damned and all. The crazy structure is what allowed the machine of unprecedented scale to be created, and now the structure has to implode. reply croes 13 minutes agorootparentprevBetter for MS and Altman, that&#x27;s exactly.AI should benefit mankind, not corporate profit. reply jug 1 hour agorootparentprevIlya should just go to Anthropic AI at this point. They have better momentum at this point after all this, and share his ideals. But it would be funny because they broke off of OpenAI because of their Microsoft ventures already in 2019, haha. He&#x27;d be welcomed with a big \"We told you so!\" reply Keyframe 20 minutes agorootparentConsidering Anthropic and them joining up, with Ilya and Dario that would be a technical powerhouse. As Amodei already showed that such a key person can ramp up quality real fast out of nothing. The two back together would be fantastic. Between Altman and Brockman there&#x27;s nothing to write home about tech-wise. reply Athari 19 minutes agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t consider Anthropic&#x27;s approach to safety fantastic. They train the model to lie, play cat and mouse with jailbreakers, run moderation on generations with delay etc. This makes the model appear safer, as it&#x27;s harder to jailbreak, but this approach solves nothing fundamentally.If Ilya is concerned about safety and alignment, he probably has a better chance to get there with OpenAI, now the he has more control over it. reply fakedang 21 minutes agorootparentprevThat would actually be a good idea imo. Ilya should make OpenAI a PBC, then merge it with Anthropic and Amazon&#x27;s compute power. Meanwhile Altman can become the next real life Nelson Bigetti or sth. reply upwardbound 29 minutes agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s a misconception that Microsoft has less morals. Their Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Eric Horvitz, was one of the key people behind America&#x27;s 2022 nuclear weapons policy update which states that we will always maintain a human in the loop for nuclear weapons employment. (i.e., systems like WOPR are now forbidden under US policy.)Here is the full excerpt of the part of the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review which was (more or less) authored behind the scenes by Microsoft&#x27;s very kind and wise CSO: We also recognize the risk of unintended nuclear escalation, which can result from accidental or unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon. The United States has extensive protections in place to mitigate this risk. As an example, U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are not on “hair trigger” alert. These forces are on day-to-day alert, a posture that contributes to strategic stability. Forces on day-to-day alert are subject to multiple layers of control, and the United States maintains rigorous procedural and technical safeguards to prevent misinformed, accidental, or unauthorized launch. Survivable and redundant sensors provide high confidence that potential attacks will be detected and characterized, enabling policies and procedures that ensure a deliberative process allowing the President sufficient time to gather information and consider courses of action. In the most plausible scenarios that concern policy leaders today, there would be time for full deliberation. For these reasons, while the United States maintains the capability to launch nuclear forces under conditions of an ongoing nuclear attack, it does not rely on a launch-under-attack policy to ensure a credible response. Rather, U.S. nuclear forces are postured to withstand an initial attack. In all cases, the United States will maintain a human “in the loop” for all actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate and terminate nuclear weapon employment.See page 49 of this PDF document: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2022&#x2F;Oct&#x2F;27&#x2F;2003103845&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;1&#x2F;202...Microsoft is also working behind the scenes to help convince China to make a similar declaration, which President Xi is considering. This would reduce the vulnerability of China to being tricked into a nuclear war by fundamentalist terrorists. (See the scenario depicted in the 2019 film The Wolf&#x27;s Call.) reply belter 21 minutes agorootparentAre you seriously arguing for Microsoft morals...On the basis of a totally logical, from a self-preserving prespective, statement on Nuclear Weapons, from a Scientific Advisor with no involvement on the day to day run of their business?What is next? A statement on Oracle kindness, based on Larry Ellison appreciation of Japanese gardens? reply lwhi 28 minutes agorootparentprevAre we talking about the same Microsoft here??!?Sheeeeh ...I grew up with Microsoft in the 80s and 90s .. Microsoft has zero morals.What you&#x27;re referring to here is instinct for self preservation. reply upwardbound 23 minutes agorootparentYou&#x27;re certainly right they were pretty evil back then. I think they became ethical at about the same time Bill Gates did. Even though this involved him stepping back to start the Gates Foundation, he was still a board member at Microsoft for a number of years, and I think helped guide its transition.As perhaps a better example, Microsoft (including Azure) has been carbon-neutral since 2012:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unfccc.int&#x2F;climate-action&#x2F;un-global-climate-action-a....https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;global-infrastructure&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;08&#x2F;making-carbon-ne... reply bbarnett 6 minutes agorootparentA supervillian can walk by a baby, become overcome with joy, and smile. That doesn&#x27;t mean his ethics are suddenly correct.It&#x27;s almost like you believe Gates is General Butt Naked, where killing babies and eating their brains is all forgiven, because he converted to Christianity, and now helps people.So?How does that absolve the faulty ethics of the past?So please, don&#x27;t tell me Gates is &#x27;ethical&#x27;. What a load of crock!As for Microsoft, there is no change. Telling me they&#x27;re carbon neutral is absurd. Carbon credits don&#x27;t count, and they&#x27;re doing it to attract clients, and employees... not because they have evolved incredible business ethics.If they had, their entire desktop experience wouldn&#x27;t, on a daily basis, fight with you, literally attack you into using their browser. They&#x27;re literally using the precise same playbook from the turn of the century.Microsoft takes your money, and then uses you, your desktop, your productivity, as the battleground to fight with competitors. They take your choice away, literally screw you over, instead of providing the absolute best experience you choose, with the product you&#x27;ve bought.And let&#x27;s not even get into the pathetic dancing advertisement platform windows is. I swear, we need to legislate this. We need to FORCE all computing platforms to be 100% ad free.And Microsoft?They. Are.

His predecessor, famed for sweating a lot, yelling (sometimes positively, not necessarily in anger), throwing chairs and insisting on giving the keynote speech every year at MWC while being irrelevant, was driving the company into the ground.Satya reverted the course spectacularly - and most importantly, he did NOT miss the \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity which he had. Unlike Billg (who missed the dawn of the Internet) and the chair-throwing dude (who fumbled Mobile), Satya is making sure Microsoft does NOT miss AI. Which is even more impressive as Google was kind of expected to be the winner initially, given the whole company&#x27;s focus , mission statement (\"to organize the world&#x27;s information and make it universally accessible and useful\") and a considerable (at the time) lead, if not a moat.I dare to compare his turnaround to Jobs&#x27;.

He wrote something along the lines, Office should write best app for iPhone, Mac or even Linux if that helps them grow. They should not help Windows sell Windows copies by doing better Office features on Windows, it is up to Windows team to make Windows best operating system, it should not rely and keep back Office team... This makes Windows and Office better, because it allows Office to be free and do what they need to grow, and it forces Windows to improve OS and not rely on others...

Microsoft by then had perhaps a dozen products with a billion dollars or more of revenue (Windows, Office, Sharepoint, Exchange, XBox, Azure, Surface, among others). Satya did well to focus on the cloud and grow opportunities there, but he hasn&#x27;t significantly increased the diversity of the product lineup. reply jacquesm 42 minutes agorootparentprevHe managed to make the whole open source world forget who enemy #1 is and got them to give him privileged access to all of their work product on his terms.

To become the CEO of MSFT is a huge political and competence firewall already. Then to do the most spectacular transformation of a mega-corp is next-level.

When they invested in Open AI it had a more mature board (in particular Reid Hoffman) and afterwards they lost a few members without replacing them.

And each one that slides on in brings a lot of the lifelong Microsoft mindset with them.So yeah working within MS will be a very different experience for Altman, but not necessarily because of an iron grip from above. reply singularity2001 31 minutes agorootparentFunny that you mention Skype as this is my prime example of extremely accelerated product disintegration. reply Wurdan 7 minutes agorootparentMy view on that (which was from very low on the totem pole) is that the acquisition happened at a time where Skype&#x27;s core business model (paid calling minutes) was under existential threat. Consumer communications preferences had started to go from synchronous (calling) to async (messaging) even before the acquisition came through. While Skype had asynchronous communications in a decent place (file transfer in the P2P days was pretty shaky but otherwise consumer Skype was a solid messaging platform), there was no revenue there for us.Then the acquisition happened at a time when Microsoft presented a lot of opportunities to ship Skype \"in the box\" to pretty much all of MS&#x27; customers. Windows 8, Xbox One and Windows Phone (8) all landed at more or less the same time. Everybody&#x27;s eyes became too big for their stomachs, and we tried to build brand new native experiences for all of these platforms (and the web) all at once. This hampered our ability to pivot and deal with the existential risks I mentioned earlier, and we had the rug pulled out from under us.So yes I think the acquisition hurt us, but I also never once heard a viable alternative business strategy that we might have pivoted to if the acquisition hadn&#x27;t happened. reply doikor 1 hour agorootparentprevThe game studios under Xbox run quite independently with the most extreme example being Mojang with Minecraft which still releases all their games on Playstation&#x2F;Nintendo consoles too.

This way at least there are two big dogs reply robbywashere_ 3 minutes agoprevnext [–]From the stygian depths of the global tech industry emerges a turn of events that portends a churning miasma of unknown consequences. Oft seen as the impenetrable leviathan of the boundless digital domain, Microsoft, it seems, is ensnaring exalted figures within its titanic coils. The conjoining of the cerebral entities Altman and Brockman- who have hitherto roamed in the lofty realm of artificial intelligence experiments at OpenAI- indicates a move as unsettling as it is awe-inspiring. The nefarious undercurrents beneath this corporate chess manoeuvre cannot be underestimated, for it is none other than the puppet master himself, Satya Nadella, who seemingly manipulates the strings with a resolve as foreboding as the stormy winter&#x27;s night. His nearly insatiable appetite for expansion glimpsed at Microsoft Ignite is but a harbinger of the harrowing transformations we can anticipate in the murky fathoms of our all too near future. The technology multidude - customers, partners, even unknowing spectators - tremble at the precipice of an altered dynamic which promises to reshape the AI field irrevocably. Indeed, one is left grappling with a dark fascination as this vortex of unpredictable novelty takes precedence. How might this consolidation of otherworldly intelligence disturb the fragile balance of an industry catapulting unbidden into the abysmal void of the AI ether? Yet, as all explorers and heedless innovators must remember, even as we tilt our ships towards the lighthouse of progress, the monstrous kraken of unintended repercussions always lurks in the unknowable deep. To approach this brave new world without a hint of trepidation would be folly. Be still, my trembling heart, as we witness this awe-inspiring dance across the cyclopean chessboard of tech. We wait, as one waits for the tide, to see what dread portents this unhallowed union may bring. reply waihtis 1 hour agoprevAnyone else find it strange that startup founders of the magnitude of Sam & Greg would join a gigantic corporation as employees?It sounds very out of line of what you&#x27;d expect. reply kjksf 1 hour agoparentTheir alternative is to start a new AI company.At this point in time a new AI company would be bottle-necked by lack of NVIDIA GPUs.

This arrangement may be the best for all involved: Microsoft gets it&#x27;s LLM geegaws based on OpenAI tech, Altman gets to build GPT marketplaces and engage whatever growth-hacking schemes he can dream of that may have been found distasteful by colleagues at OpenAI, and OpenAI can focus on the core mission and fulfilling contractual obligations to MicrosoftI foresee this new group building on top of (rather than completing with) OpenAI tech in the near-to-mid term, maybe competing in the long term of they manage to gather adequate talent, but it&#x27;s going to be going against the cultural corporate headwinds.I wonder if Microsoft will tolerate the hardware side-gig and if this internal-startup will succeed or if it will end up being a managed exit to paper over OpenAIs abrupt transition (by public company standards).

    "originBody": "StyleTTS 2: Towards Human-Level Text-to-Speech through Style Diffusion and Adversarial Training with Large Speech Language Models Yinghao Aaron Li, Cong Han, Vinay S. Raghavan, Gavin Mischler, Nima Mesgarani In this paper, we present StyleTTS 2, a text-to-speech (TTS) model that leverages style diffusion and adversarial training with large speech language models (SLMs) to achieve human-level TTS synthesis. StyleTTS 2 differs from its predecessor by modeling styles as a latent random variable through diffusion models to generate the most suitable style for the text without requiring reference speech, achieving efficient latent diffusion while benefiting from the diverse speech synthesis offered by diffusion models. Furthermore, we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS synthesis on both single and multispeaker datasets, showcasing the potential of style diffusion and adversarial training with large SLMs. Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07691 Audio samples: https://styletts2.github.io/ TODO Training and inference demo code for single-speaker models (LJSpeech) Test training code for multi-speaker models (VCTK and LibriTTS) Finish demo code for multispeaker model and upload pre-trained models Add a finetuning script for new speakers with base pre-trained multispeaker models Fix DDP (accelerator) for train_second.py (I have tried everything I could to fix this but had no success, so if you are willing to help, please see #7) Pre-requisites Python >= 3.7 Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2.git cd StyleTTS2 Install python requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt On Windows add: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 -U Also install phonemizer and espeak if you want to run the demo: pip install phonemizer sudo apt-get install espeak-ng Download and extract the LJSpeech dataset, unzip to the data folder and upsample the data to 24 kHz. The text aligner and pitch extractor are pre-trained on 24 kHz data, but you can easily change the preprocessing and re-train them using your own preprocessing. For LibriTTS, you will need to combine train-clean-360 with train-clean-100 and rename the folder train-clean-460 (see val_list_libritts.txt as an example). Training First stage training: accelerate launch train_first.py --config_path ./Configs/config.yml Second stage training (DDP version not working, so the current version uses DP, again see #7 if you want to help): python train_second.py --config_path ./Configs/config.yml You can run both consecutively and it will train both the first and second stages. The model will be saved in the format \"epoch_1st_%05d.pth\" and \"epoch_2nd_%05d.pth\". Checkpoints and Tensorboard logs will be saved at log_dir. The data list format needs to be filename.wav|transcription|speaker, see val_list.txt as an example. The speaker labels are needed for multi-speaker models because we need to sample reference audio for style diffusion model training. Important Configurations In config.yml, there are a few important configurations to take care of: OOD_data: The path for out-of-distribution texts for SLM adversarial training. The format should be text|anything. min_length: Minimum length of OOD texts for training. This is to make sure the synthesized speech has a minimum length. max_len: Maximum length of audio for training. The unit is frame. Since the default hop size is 300, one frame is approximately 300 / 24000 (0.125) second. Lowering this if you encounter the out-of-memory issue. multispeaker: Set to true if you want to train a multispeaker model. This is needed because the architecture of the denoiser is different for single and multispeaker models. batch_percentage: This is to make sure during SLM adversarial training there are no out-of-memory (OOM) issues. If you encounter OOM problem, please set a lower number for this. Pre-trained modules In Utils folder, there are three pre-trained models: ASR folder: It contains the pre-trained text aligner, which was pre-trained on English (LibriTTS), Japanese (JVS), and Chinese (AiShell) corpus. It works well for most other languages without fine-tuning, but you can always train your own text aligner with the code here: yl4579/AuxiliaryASR. JDC folder: It contains the pre-trained pitch extractor, which was pre-trained on English (LibriTTS) corpus only. However, it works well for other languages too because F0 is independent of language. If you want to train on singing corpus, it is recommended to train a new pitch extractor with the code here: yl4579/PitchExtractor. PLBERT folder: It contains the pre-trained PL-BERT model, which was pre-trained on English (Wikipedia) corpus only. It probably does not work very well on other languages, so you will need to train a different PL-BERT for different languages using the repo here: yl4579/PL-BERT. You can also replace this module with other phoneme BERT models like XPhoneBERT which is pre-trained on more than 100 languages. Common Issues Loss becomes NaN: If it is the first stage, please make sure you do not use mixed precision, as it can cause loss becoming NaN for some particular datasets when the batch size is not set properly (need to be more than 16 to work well). For the second stage, please also experiment with different batch sizes, with higher batch sizes being more likely to cause NaN loss values. We recommend the batch size to be 16. You can refer to issues #10 and #11 for more details. Out of memory: Please either use lower batch_size or max_len. You may refer to issue #10 for more information. Finetuning The script is modified from train_second.py which uses DP, as DDP does not work for train_second.py. Please see the bold section above if you are willing to help with this problem. python train_finetune.py --config_path ./Configs/config_ft.yml Please make sure you have the LibriTTS checkpoint downloaded and unzipped under the folder. The default configuration config_ft.yml finetunes on LJSpeech with 1 hour of speech data (around 1k samples) for 50 epochs. This took about 4 hours to finish on four NVidia A100. The quality is slightly worse (similar to NaturalSpeech on LJSpeech) than LJSpeech model trained from scratch with 24 hours of speech data, which took around 2.5 days to finish on four A100. Inference Please refer to Inference_LJSpeech.ipynb (single-speaker) and Inference_LibriTTS.ipynb (multi-speaker) for details. For LibriTTS, you will also need to download reference_audio.zip and unzip it under the demo before running the demo. The pretrained StyleTTS 2 on LJSpeech corpus in 24 kHz can be downloaded at StyleTTS 2 LJSpeech Link. The pretrained StyleTTS 2 model on LibriTTS can be downloaded at StyleTTS 2 LibriTTS Link. Before using these pre-trained models, you agree to inform the listeners that the speech samples are synthesized by the pre-trained models, unless you have the permission to use the voice you synthesize. That is, you agree to only use voices whose speakers grant the permission to have their voice cloned, either directly or by license before making synthesized voices pubilc, or you have to publicly announce that these voices are synthesized if you do not have the permission to use these voices. Common Issues High-pitched background noise: This is caused by numerical float differences in older GPUs. For more details, please refer to issue #13. Basically, you will need to use more modern GPUs or do inference on CPUs. Pre-trained model license: You only need to abide by the above rules if you use the pre-trained models and the voices are NOT in the training set, i.e., your reference speakers are not from any open access dataset. For more details of rules to use the pre-trained models, please see #37.

It responds so much faster than ChatGPT. You can have a real conversation with it instead of the stilted Siri-style interaction you have with other voice assistants. Fun to play with!Anyone who has a Windows gaming PC with a 12 GB Nvidia GPU (tested on 3060 12GB) can install and converse with StyleTTS2 with one click, no fiddling with Python or CUDA needed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.microsoft.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;9NC624PBFGB7The demo is janky in various ways (requires headphones, runs as a console app, etc), but it&#x27;s a sneak peek at what will soon be possible to run on a normal gaming PC just by putting together open source pieces. The models are improving rapidly, there are already several improved models I haven&#x27;t yet incorporated. reply lucubratory 11 hours agoparentHow hard on your end does the task of making the chatbot converse naturally look? Specifically I&#x27;m thinking about interruptions, if it&#x27;s talking too long I would like to be able to start talking and interrupt it like in a normal conversation, or if I&#x27;m saying something it could quickly interject something. Once you&#x27;ve got the extremely high speed, theoretically faster than real time, you can start doing that stuff right?There is another thing remaining after that for fully natural conversation, which is making the AI context aware like a human would be. Basically giving it eyes so it can see your face and judge body language to know if it&#x27;s talking too long and needs to be more brief, the same way a human talks. reply modeless 11 hours agorootparentYes, I implemented the ability to interrupt the chatbot while it is talking. It wasn&#x27;t too hard, although it does require you to wear headphones so the bot doesn&#x27;t hear itself and get interrupted.The other way around (bot interrupting the user) is hard. Currently the bot starts processing a response after every word that the voice recognition outputs, to reduce latency. When new words come in before the response is ready it starts over. If it finishes its response before any more words arrive (~1 second usually) it starts speaking. This is not ideal because the user might not be done speaking, of course. If the user continues speaking the bot will stop and listen. But deciding when the user is done speaking, or if the bot should interrupt before the user is done, is a hard problem. It could possibly be done zero-shot using prompting of a LLM but you&#x27;d want a GPT-4 level LLM to do a good job and GPT-4 is too slow for instant response right now. A better idea would be to train a dedicated turn-taking model that directly predicts who should speak next in conversations. I haven&#x27;t thought much about how to source a dataset and train a model for that yet.Ultimately the end state of this type of system is a complete end-to-end audio-to-audio language model. There should be only one model, it should take audio directly as input and produce audio directly as output. I believe that having TTS and voice recognition and language modeling all as separate systems will not get us to 100% natural human conversation. I think that such a system would be within reach of today&#x27;s hardware too, all you need is the right training dataset&#x2F;procedure and some architecture bits to make it efficient.As for giving the model eyes, actually there are already open source vision-language models that could be used for this today! I&#x27;d love to implement one in my chatbot. It probably wouldn&#x27;t have social intelligence to read body language yet, but it could definitely answer questions about things you present to the webcam, read text, maybe even look at your computer screen and have conversations about what&#x27;s on your screen. The latter could potentially be very useful, the endgame there is like GitHub Copilot for everything you do on your computer, not just typing code. reply lucubratory 10 hours agorootparentThanks, fascinating insights. I think an everything-to-everything multimodal model could work if it&#x27;s big enough because of transfer learning (but then there are latency issues), and so could a refined system built on LLMs&#x2F;LMMs with TTS (like what you are using), but I haven&#x27;t seen any good research on audio-to-audio language models. My suspicion is that that would take a lot of compute, much more than text, and that the amount of semantically meaningful accessible data might be much lower as well. And if you do manage to get to the same level of quality as text, what is latency like then? Not 100% sure, just intuitions, but I doubt it&#x27;s great.I like the idea of an RL predictor for interruption timing, although I think it might struggle with factual-correction interruptions. It could be a good way to make a very fast system, and if latency on the rest of the system is low enough you could probably start slipping in your \"Of course\", \"Yeah, I agree\", and \"It was in March, but yeah\" for truly natural speech. If latency is low you could just use the RL system to find opportunities to interrupt, give them to the LLM&#x2F;LMM, and it decides how to interrupt, all the way from \"mhm\", to \"Yep, sounds good to me\", to \"Not quite, it was the 3rd entry, but yeah otherwise it makes sense\", to \"Actually can I quickly jump on that? I just wanted to quickly [make a point]&#x2F;[ask a question] about [some thing that requires exploration before the conversation continues]\".Tuning a system like this would be the most annoying activity in human history, but something like this has to be achieved for truly natural conversation so we gotta do it lol. reply slow_numbnut 2 hours agorootparentprevInstead of sacrificing flexibility by building one monolith model that does Audio to audio in one go, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to train a model that handles conversing with the user (knows when the user is done talking, when it&#x27;s hearing itself, etc) and leave the thinking to other, more generic models? reply modeless 2 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t lose flexibility with an end to end model. You lose controllability. But there are ways to mitigate that. reply fintechie 10 hours agorootparentprev> although it does require you to wear headphones so the bot doesn&#x27;t hear itself and get interrupted.Maybe you can use some sort of speaker identification to sort this out?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openai&#x2F;whisper&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;264 reply woodson 4 hours agorootparentA simple correlation of audio chunks from microphone and from the TTS should be enough to tell which parts in the input stream are re-recorded TTS. Much simpler, no? reply modeless 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not so simple when the impulse response of the room and mic and speakers are all unknown, possibly changing, plus unknown background sounds as well, possibly at a very high level. and there&#x27;s also unknown latency which can be quite large especially in the networked case, and maybe some codecs, and maybe some audio \"enhancement\" software the OEM installed on the user&#x27;s machine. Also, ideally the computer would be able to hear the user even while it is speaking.Echo cancellation is non-trivial for sure. reply modeless 8 hours agorootparentprevYes, this is a good idea. Too many good ideas, not enough time! reply globalnode 10 hours agorootparentprevyou&#x27;d have to do something along the lines of what voice comm does to combat the output feedback problem. i think it involves an fft to analyse the two signals and cancel out the feedback, im not 100% sure on the details. reply modeless 8 hours agorootparentI plan to change the audio input to use WebRTC, then I get echo cancellation and network transparency for free. Although dealing with WebRTC is a headache harder than doing the AI parts. reply Sean-Der 8 hours agorootparentWhat do you find hard about WebRTC?I would love to help. Would even code up a prototype if you wanted :) reply modeless 8 hours agorootparentFor starters, every WebRTC demo I&#x27;ve tried has at least 400ms of round trip latency even on a loopback connection. Shoot me an email if you know WebRTC, would be good to chat with someone who knows stuff! reply joshspankit 8 hours agorootparentprevShort-term could it be configured as push to talk? reply modeless 8 hours agorootparentCertainly, but then it has little advantage over e.g. ChatGPT voice mode. I guess running locally is an advantage but the voice and answer quality is worse. The much better latency and more natural conversation is what I like about it. reply joshspankit 6 hours agorootparentAm I wrong to think it would have a couple major advantages? Like using speakers without having to worry about echo cancellation, having a distinct interrupt signal, and still getting all the latency benefits (possibly even more once you get used to it since the conversational style has to assume the end of the user’s sentence instead of knowing the second they let go of the button) reply modeless 6 hours agorootparentYou wouldn&#x27;t quite have all the latency benefits because you&#x27;d have the additional delay between when you stop speaking and when you release the button (or cut off speech if you release too early). It wouldn&#x27;t respond any faster because it&#x27;s already responding at the fastest possible speed right now, it doesn&#x27;t wait at all. And it wouldn&#x27;t be hands free, it wouldn&#x27;t feel like a natural conversation which is what I&#x27;m going for.I&#x27;d rather use speaker diarization and&#x2F;or echo cancellation to solve the problem without needing the user to press any buttons. reply taneq 7 hours agorootparentprevDeciding when someone is done speaking is hard to do well and impossible to do perfectly. Some people finish speaking, then think of something else to say and pretend they were still talking. reply modeless 7 hours agorootparentTrue, perfection isn&#x27;t achievable but human level performance is all you need and it may be possible to do better than that. reply eigenvalue 9 hours agoparentprevTried it but it seems it only works with Cuda 11 and I have 12 installed.

I plan to move away from faster_whisper which may fix this.I have to say that the Python ecosystem is just awful for distribution purposes and I spent a lot longer on packaging issues than I did on the actual AI parts. And clearly didn&#x27;t find all of the issues :) reply eigenvalue 7 hours agorootparentAgree completely. But in this case the fault is with CUDA which never ever works without a struggle. It’s insane how hard it is to get stuff that works cross-platform without a lot of work using CUDA. Even PyTorch has an awkward way of dealing with it and they have more resources to figure it out than just about anyone. replyshon 4 hours agoparentprevCool work! I tested it and got some mixed results:1) it throws an error if it&#x27;s installed to any drive other than C:\\ --I moved it to C: and it works fine.2) I&#x27;m seeing huge latency on an EVGA 3080Ti with 12GB.

Yes, right now you need to use headphones so it doesn&#x27;t hear itself. Sometimes Whisper inexplicably fails to recognize speech promptly. It seems to depend on what you say, so try saying something else. I have improvements that I haven&#x27;t had time to release yet that should improve the situation, and a lot more work is definitely needed, this is definitely MVP level stuff right now. This stuff is fixable but it&#x27;ll take time. reply samsepi0l121 9 hours agoparentprevBut whisper does not support input streaming, so you have to wait for the whole llm response to trigger the transcription or not? reply yencabulator 8 hours agorootparentApparently, by running it on windows of audio very often:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38340938 reply aik 7 hours agoparentprevHey modeless.

Open source that also makes money is always the holy grail :) I&#x27;ll post updates on my Twitter&#x2F;X account. reply tomp 10 hours agoparentprevHow do you get Whisper to be fast?Isn&#x27;t it quite non-realtime? reply modeless 8 hours agorootparentGreat question! Whisper processes audio in 30 second chunks. But on a fast GPU it can finish in only 100 milliseconds or so. So you can run it 10+ times per second and get around 100ms latency. Even better actually because Whisper will predict past the end of the audio sometimes.This is an advantage of running locally. Running whisper this way is inefficient but I have a whole GPU sitting there dedicated to one user, so it&#x27;s not a problem as long as it is fast enough. It wouldn&#x27;t work well for a cloud service trying to optimize GPU use. But there are other ways of doing real time speech recognition that could be used there. reply TOMDM 10 hours agorootparentprevThe community upgrades to whisper are far faster than real-time, especially if you have a powerful gpu reply wahnfrieden 10 hours agorootparentprevuse whisper-distil, it&#x27;s like 5-8x faster reply funtech 7 hours agoparentprevIs 12GB the minimum? got an out of memory error with 8GB reply modeless 7 hours agorootparentYes, unfortunately these models take a lot of VRAM.

OMG that’s exactly what I was thinking! reply refulgentis 13 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what you mean: If you mean could inpainting and out painting with image models be faster, its a \"not even wrong\" question, similar to asking if the United Airlines app could get faster because American Airlines did. (Yes, getting faster is an option available to ~all code)If you mean could you inpaint and outpaint text...yes, by inserting and deleting characters.If you mean could you use an existing voice clip to generate speech by the same speaker in the clip, yes, part of the article is demonstrating generating speech by speakers not seen at training time reply pedrovhb 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure I understand what you mean to say. To me it&#x27;s a reasonable question asking whether text to speech models can complete a missing part of some existing speech audio, or make it go on for longer, rather than only generating speech from scratch. I don&#x27;t see a connection to your faster apps analogy.Fwiw, I imagine this is possible, at least to some extent. I was recently playing with xtts and it can generate speaker embeddings from short periods of speech, so you could use those to provide a logical continuation to existing audio. However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible or easy to manage the \"seams\" between what is generated and what is preexisting very easily yet.It&#x27;s certainly not a misguided question to me.

Maybe you can explain to the rest of the class what he meant then? If it was obviously phonemes, will you then advocate for them being downvoted through the floor since the answer was obvious? Or is it only people who assume good faith and ask what they meant who deserve downvotes? reply IshKebab 2 hours agorootparentInpainting and outpainting of images is when the model generates bits inside or outside the image that don&#x27;t exist. By analogy he was talking about generating sound inside (I.e. filling gaps) or outside (extrapolating beyond the end) the audio.I don&#x27;t know why you would think he was talking about inpainting images, words. This whole discussion is about speech synthesis. replykelseyfrog 12 hours agorootparentprevIgnore the speed comment; it is unrelated to my question.What I mean is, can output be conditioned on antecedent audio as well as text analogous to how image diffusion models can condition inpainting and outpatient on static parts of an image and clip embeddings? reply refulgentis 11 hours agorootparentYes, the paper and Eleven Labs have a major feature of \"given $AUDIO_SET, generate speech for $TEXT in the same style of $AUDIO_SET\"No, in that, you can&#x27;t cut it at an arbitrary midword point, say at \"what tim\" in \"what time is it bejing\", and give it the string \"what time is it in beijing\", and have it recover seamlessly.Yes, in that, you can cut it at an arbirtrary phoneme boundary, say &#x27;this, I.S. a; good: test! ok?&#x27; in IPA is &#x27;ðˈɪs, ˌaɪˌɛsˈeɪ; ɡˈʊd: tˈɛst! ˌoʊkˈeɪ?&#x27;, and I can cut it &#x27;between&#x27; a phoneme, give it the and have it complete. reply kelseyfrog 11 hours agorootparentPerfect!

But to me, what makes Eleven so cool is that they have a large library of high quality voices that are easy to choose from. I don&#x27;t yet see any way with this library to get a different voice from the default female voice.Also, the real special sauce for Eleven is the near instant voice cloning with just a single 5 minute sample, which works shockingly (even spookily) well.

Imagine licensing your voice to Amazon so that any customer could stream any book narrated in your likeness without you having to commit the time to record.

You could profit from your performance and craft in a fraction of the time, focusing as your own agent on the management of your assets. Or, you could just keep and commit to your day job.Just imagine hearing the final novel of ASoIaF narrated by Roy Dotrice and knowing that a royalty went to his family and estate, or if David Attenborough willed the digital likeness of his voice and its performance to the BBC for use in nature documentaries after his death.The advent of recorded audio didn&#x27;t put artists out of business, it expanded the industries that relied on them by allowing more of them to work. Film and tape didn&#x27;t put artists out of business, it expanded the industries that relied on them by allowing more of them to work. Audio digitization and the internet didn&#x27;t put artists out of business; it expanded the industries that relied on them by allowing more of them to work.And TTS won&#x27;t put artists out of business, but it will create yet another new market with another niche that people will have to figure out how to monetize, even though 98% of the revenues will still somehow end up with the distributors. reply nikkwong 12 hours agorootparentWhat you&#x27;re not considering here is that a large majority of this industry is made up of no-name voice actors who have a pleasant (but perfectly substitutible) voice which is now something that AI can do perfectly and at a fraction of the price.Sure, celebrities and other well-known figures will have more to gain here as they can license out their voice; but the majority of voice actors won&#x27;t be able to capitalize on this.

I work with them, and I&#x27;ve been one (am one, rarely).I listed just one possible use, but I also see voice cloning and advanced TTS expanding access for evocative instruction, as an aid to study style and expand range.Don&#x27;t be afraid on their behalf. The dooming you&#x27;re talking about applied to every one of the technological changes I already listed, and we employ more performers and artists today than ever in history.When animation went digital, we graduated more storyboard artists and digital animators. When music notation software and sampling could replace musicians and orchestras, we graduated more musicians and composers trained on those tools. Now it&#x27;s the performing arts, and no one in industry is going to shrink their pool of available talent (or risk ire) by daring conflate authenticity and performance with virtual impersonation. Performance capture and vfx also didn&#x27;t kill or consolidate the movie industry - it allowed it to expand.Art evolves, and so does its business.

Sure, a voice actor can add a lot of emotion and verbal nuance in a way that is differentiating, but I&#x27;m not sure if the difference is enough to matter for most people for the vast majority of cases. (Or I may be too dense to realize it). This is in contradiction to say performing arts, where there are in my opinion many more dimensions to the creative output which makes it less perfectly substitutable. reply vunderba 5 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not really thinking it through. I have friends involved in the VA business, and it&#x27;s only gotten more competitive as time has progressed - this is partially because it&#x27;s rare that we need a voice actor that needs to create a crazy Looney Tunes sounding voice, the majority of VA work is surprisingly just close to the natural sounding voice of the VA themselves.It&#x27;s rare that you need a talent like Dan Castellaneta, Mel Blanc, etc.Secondly, yes, VA licensing will become a thing – but that means that jobs that would previously be available to other lesser known voice actors, because the major players simply didn&#x27;t have enough time to take those gigs, can no longer take them. A TTSVA can do unlimited recordings.Thirdly, major studios that would require hundreds of voices for video games and other things don&#x27;t have to license known voices at all, they can just create generate brand new ones and pay zero licensing fees. reply bongodongobob 11 hours agorootparentprevThe point is no one will pay for any of that if you can just clone someone&#x27;s voice locally.

It&#x27;s just too hard to figure out the dependencies. reply lukasga 13 hours agoparentprevCan relate to this problem a lot. I have considered starting using a Docker dev container and making a base image for shared dependencies which I then can customize in a dockerfile for each new project, not sure if there&#x27;s a better alternative though. reply stevenhuang 3 hours agorootparentYeah there is the official Nvidia container with torch+cuda pre-installed that some projects use.I feel more projects should start with that as the base instead of pinning on whatever variants. Most aren&#x27;t using specialized CUDA kernels after all.Suppose there&#x27;s the answer, just pick the specific torch+CUDA base that matches the major version of the project you want to run. Then cross your fingers and hope the dependencies mesh :p. reply eurekin 13 hours agoparentprevSame here. I&#x27;m using conda and eyeing simply installing a pytorch into the base conda env reply lhl 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think \"base\" works like that (while it can be a fallback for some dependencies, afaik, Python packages are isolated&#x2F;not in path). But even if you could, don&#x27;t do it. Different packages usually have different pytorch dependencies (often CUDA as well) and it will definitely bite you.The biggest optimization I&#x27;ve found is to use mamba for everything. It&#x27;s ridiculously faster than conda for package resolution. With everything cached, you&#x27;re mostly just waiting for your SSD at that point.(I suppose you could add the base env&#x27;s lib path to the end of your PYTHONPATH, but that sounds like a sure way to get bitten by weird dependency&#x2F;reproducibility issues down the line.) reply eurekin 10 hours agorootparentThank you! First time I come across.

Looks like the first one wasn&#x27;t either. Interesting to see moves away from flows, especially when none of the flows were modern.Also, is no one clicking on the audio links? There are some... questionable ones... and I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of mistakes. reply lhl 14 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s not called a GAN TTS right? StyleGAN is called what it is because of a \"style-based\" approach and StyleTTS&#x2F;2 seems to be doing the same (applying style transfer) through different method (and disentangling style from the rest of the voice synthesis).(Actually, looked at the original StyleTTS paper and it actually even partially uses AdaIN in the decoder, which is the same way that StyleGAN injected style information? Still, I think is besides the point for the naming.) reply godelski 12 hours agorootparentYeah no I get this but the naming convention has become so prolific that anyone working in generative space hears \"Style\" and you should think \"GAN\". (I work in generative vision btw)My point is not that it is technically right, it is that the name is strongly related with the concept now. Such that if you use a style based network and don&#x27;t name it StyleX that it&#x27;s odd and might look like you&#x27;re trying to claim you&#x27;ve done more. Not that there aren&#x27;t plenty of GANs that are using Karras&#x27;s code and called something else.> AdaINYes, StyleGAN (version 1) uses AdaIN but StyleGAN2 (and beyond) doesn&#x27;t. AdaIN stands for Adaptive Instance Normalization. While they use it in that network, to be clear, they did not invent AdaIN and the technique isn&#x27;t explicit to style, it&#x27;s a normalization technique. One that StyleGAN2 modifies because the standard one creates strong and localized spikes in the statistics which results in image artifacts. reply lhl 11 hours agorootparentSo what I&#x27;m hearing is... no one should use \"style\" in its name anymore to describe style transfers because it&#x27;s too closely associated with a set of models in a sub-field that uses a different concept to apply style that used \"style\" in its name, unless it also uses that unrelated concept in its implementation? Is that the gist of it, because that sounds a bit mental.(I&#x27;m half kidding, I get what you mean, but also, think about it. The alternative is worse.) reply godelski 9 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m half kidding, I get what you meanI mean yeah, I&#x27;m not saying that they shouldn&#x27;t be able to use the name. There&#x27;s no control of \"StyleX\" but it certainly is a poor choice that can lead to confusion. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m getting at. 100% this is an opinion (would be insane if believed to be anything else).I don&#x27;t think it is just a \"sub-field\" as you mention and it definitely isn&#x27;t like StyleGAN isn&#x27;t known by nearly every person that learns ML (I have seen very few courses that do not mention it, but those tend to be ones that don&#x27;t discuss generation at all). StyleGAN is one of the most well known models that exist. Up there with GPT, YOLO, and ViT. Realistically we use these names as a style of model now rather than the actual original model themselves (or somewhat interchangeably).The original StyleTTS&#x27;s abstract has the line> Here, we propose StyleTTS, a style-based generative model for parallel TTSAnd I certainly would not blame anyone for thinking \"Oh, they&#x27;re using a StyleGAN\". That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. Their style encoder looks nothing like the StyleGAN&#x27;s style encoder. It looks a bit closer to the synthesis network but that&#x27;s just because they&#x27;re using Leaky ReLUs and AdaIN, but like we said before, that&#x27;s not really a StyleGAN specific thing. There are also other parts we could say look similar but they are pretty generic sections that I wouldn&#x27;t particularly think uniquely pertains to StyleGAN architectures (or StyleDiffusion ones that do make this callback).It other words, it&#x27;s like naming something iX. Sure, Apple doesn&#x27;t have complete control over a leading letter but I also understand Apple&#x27;s claim that such a naming pattern can confuse people. Certainly a name collision. Hell, I&#x27;ll say that the authors that made this paper knew what they were doing https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2212.01452I just think they can come up with a better name that has worse chance of collision. It&#x27;s not like StyleTTS is a particularly creative name or even that apt of a description either. Names are important because they do mean things. You may think it is not a poor choice of naming and that&#x27;s okay too. But we also work in different fields too and I&#x27;d argue that research papers are aimed at other researchers, where I would be surprised if anyone works in generations (image, voice, language, data, whatever) is not well aware of the Style based networks. Because I can use that sentence and it make sense to most ML people. reply gwern 14 hours agoparentprev> Looks like the first one wasn&#x27;t either.The first one says it uses AdaIN layers to help control style? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2205.15439.pdf#page=2 Seems as justifiable as the original StyleGAN calling itself StyleX... reply godelski 12 hours agorootparentSee my other comment.

The Whisper STT models are open so just chop up a ton of audio and use Whisper to annotate it, then train the other direction to produce audio from text. So you’re basically inverting Whisper. reply eginhard 12 hours agoparentSTT training data includes all kinds of \"noisy\" speech so that the model learns to recognise speech in any conditions. TTS training data needs to be as clean as possible so that you don&#x27;t introduce artefacts in the output and this high-quality data is much harder to get. A simple inversion is not really feasible or at least requires filtering out much of the data. reply nmfisher 9 hours agoparentprevI think you’re talking about just using Whisper to annotate audio for a TTS pipeline but someone from Collabora actually created a TTS model directly from Whisper embeddings https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;collabora&#x2F;WhisperSpeech reply ddmma 12 hours agoprevWell done, been waiting for a moment like this.

It&#x27;s just warning people that cloned voices come with a different set of rights to the software (because the person the voice is a clone of has rights to their voice). reply chrismorgan 15 hours agorootparent(Don’t let’s derail the conversation, please, but “disclaimer” is completely the wrong word here. This is a condition of use. A disclaimer is “this isn’t mine” or “I’m not responsible for this”. Disclaimers and disclosures are quite different things and commonly confused, but this isn’t even either of them.) reply gosub100 14 hours agorootparentThis always annoys me when people put \"disclaimers\" on their posts. IANAL, so tired of hearing that one. It&#x27;s pointless because even if you were a lawyer, you cannot meaningfully comment on a case without the details, jurisdiction, circumstance, etc. Next, it&#x27;s meaningless because is anyone going to blindly bow down and obey if you state the opposite? \"Yes, I AM a lawyer, you do not need to pay taxes, they are unconstitutional.\" Thirdly, when they \"disclaimer\" themselves as working at google, that&#x27;s not a dis-claimer, thats a \"claimer\", asserting the affirmative. I know their companies require them to not speak for the company without permission, but I hardly ever hear that one, usually its just some useless self-disclosure that they might be biased because they work there. Ok, who isn&#x27;t biased?What bugs me overall is that it&#x27;s usually vapid mimicry of a phrase they don&#x27;t even understand. reply nielsole 11 hours agorootparentIanal, but giving legal advice without being a lawyer may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Not sure if the disclaimer is effective or was ever tested in court. The disclaimer&#x2F;disclosure mix-up is super annoying, but disclosing obvious biases even if not legally required seems like good practice to me. reply gpm 15 hours agoparentprevAs I understand it the source code is licensed MIT, the weights are licensed \"weird proprietary license that doesn&#x27;t explicitly grant you any rights and implicitly probably grants you some usage rights so long as you tell the listeners or have permission from the voice you cloned\".Which, if you think the weights are copyright-able in the first place, makes them practically unusable for anything commercial&#x2F;that you might get sued over because relying on a vague implicit license is definitely not a good idea. reply ronsor 11 hours agorootparentAnd if you don&#x27;t think weights are copyrightable, it means nothing at all. reply ericra 15 hours agoparentprevThis bothered me as well.

    "originBody": "Artificial Intelligence/ Tech/ Microsoft Sam Altman isn’t coming back to OpenAI Sam Altman isn’t coming back to OpenAI / In a twist that no one saw coming, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear is the new CEO. Meanwhile, Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are going to Microsoft. By Nilay Patel and Alex Heath Nov 20, 2023, 5:14 AM UTC| Share this story Sam Altman at OpenAI’s first conference on November 6th, Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images After a weekend of negotiations to potentially bring back Sam Altman as OpenAI CEO following his shock firing, the company’s nonprofit board has gone another way entirely and named former Twitch CEO and co-founder Emmett Shear as interim CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter. He will take over as CEO from Mira Murati, who was publicly aligned with Altman. That’s three CEOs in three days, if you’re keeping track. Shear’s surprise appointment comes after OpenAI’s four-person board refused to step down and let Altman return, according to multiple sources. The news was first reported by The Information, which said that employees were told Sunday that removing Altman was the “only path” to achieving the company’s mission of “broadly beneficial” artificial general intelligence. Spokespeople for OpenAI didn’t respond to requests for comment. Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s largest investor, seems to have made the best of the situation. In a statement Sunday evening, CEO Satya Nadella said that “we remain committed to our partnership with OpenAI and have confidence in our product roadmap.” Meanwhile, Altman and former president Greg Brockman are joining Microsoft “with colleagues” to “lead a new advanced AI research team.” “We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success,” Nadella said. OpenAI’s four-person board refused to step down Altman’s sudden exit at OpenAI came after the board said he had not been “consistently candid in his communications.” As we reported Saturday, the board quickly began discussing his return under pressure from investors and the threat of a mass employee walkout. On Saturday, the remaining board members missed a 5PM PT deadline set by Altman’s camp to resign and reinstate him alongside fellow co-founder Greg Brockman, or face a slew of staff resignations. After the deadline passed, droves of OpenAI employees started posting their support for Altman on social media. Altman returned to OpenAI’s office on Sunday saying it would be the “first and last time” he wore a guest badge, implying that he would either return as CEO or not set foot in the building again. Another deadline to reach a truce by 5 PM on Sunday was missed. OpenAI’s board, which oversees the nonprofit parent company, consists of chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, former GeoSim Systems CEO Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner, the director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Sutskever, a leading researcher in the field who reportedly set a wooden effigy representing “unaligned” AI on fire at a company offsite, played the leading role in ousting Altman. Emmett Shear. Photo by Eoin Noonan /Web Summit via Getty Images Naming Shear as the CEO of the most high-profile AI company in the world is a surprise, given that he isn’t seen as a leader in the space. Back in March, he left Twitch right before a significant round of layoffs. It saw another round of layoffs in October. Amazon bought the live streaming service for $1 billion in 2014. “Today I got a call inviting me to consider a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: to become the interim CEO of @OpenAI,” Shear wrote on X. “After consulting with my family and reflecting on it for just a few hours, I accepted.” “I’m not crazy enough to take this job without board support for commercializing our awesome models.” “OpenAI employees are extremely impressive, as you might have guessed, and mission-driven in the extreme,” he continued. “And it’s clear that the process and communications around Sam’s removal has been handled very badly, which has seriously damaged our trust.” He went on to say that the board didn’t fire Altman “over any specific disagreement on safety, their reasoning was completely different from that. I’m not crazy enough to take this job without board support for commercializing our awesome models.” OpenAI’s profile has skyrocketed since the launch of ChatGPT barely a year ago. Earlier this month, Altman announced that it has over 100 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing services of all time.

Why would workers immediately quit their job when he has no other company, and does he even know who these workers are? Are these people that desperate to make a buck (or the prospect of big bucks)? It seems like half of the people working at the non-profit were not actually concerned about the mission but rather just waiting out their turn for big bucks and fame.What does Altman bring to the table besides raising money from foreign governments and states, apparently? I just do not understand all of this. Like, how does him leaving and getting replaced by another CEO the next week really change anything at the ground level other than distractions from the mission being gone?And the outpouring of support for someone who was clearly not operating how he marketed himself publicly is strange and disturbing indeed. reply jmerz 2 hours agoparentI think he&#x27;s not as known in the outside world but it&#x27;s really difficult to understate the amount of social capital sama has in the inner circles of Silicon Valley. It sounds like he did a good job instilling loyalty as a CEO as well, but the SV thing means that the more connected someone at the company is to the SV ecosystem, the more likely they like him&#x2F;want to be on his good side.This is kind of like the leadership of the executive branch switching parties. You&#x27;re not going to say \"why would the staff immediately quit?\" Especially since this is corporate America, and sama can have another \"country\" next week. reply bmitc 2 hours agorootparentSo it&#x27;s a big deal because he has a cult of personality? reply belugacat 2 hours agorootparentIt’s a big deal because he’s extremely charismatic and well connected and that matters much, much more for a tech company’s success than some programmers like to think. reply bmitc 2 hours agorootparentI have watched him speak, and he doesn&#x27;t seem charismatic at all.

Are you asking what leaders do and why an employee would care about what they do...? reply bmitc 1 hour agorootparentDo you understand why he was fired? The company had a charter, one the board is to help uphold. Altman and his crew were leading the company, and seemingly its employees, away from that charter. He was not open about how he was doing that. The board fired him.This is like a bunch of people joining a basketball team where the coach starts turning it into a soccer team, and then the GM fires the coach for doing this and everyone calls the GM crazy and stupid. If you want to play soccer, go play soccer!If you want to make a ton of money in a startup moving fast, how about don&#x27;t setup a non-profit company spouting a bunch of humanitarian shit? It&#x27;s even worse, because Altman very clearly did all this intentionally by playing the \"I care about humanity card\" just long enough while riding on the coattails of researchers where he could start up side processes to use his new AI profile to make the big bucks. But now people want to make him a martyr simply because the board called his bluff. It&#x27;s bewildering. reply jstummbillig 1 hour agorootparent> Do you understand why he was fired?Do you? Because that part is way more irritating, and, honestly, starting to read your original comment I thought that was where you were going with this: Why was he fired, exactly?The way the statement was framed basically painted him a liar, in a way, so vague, that people put forth the most insane theories about why. I can sense some animosity, but do you really think it&#x27;s okay to fire anyone in a way, where to the outside the possible explanation ranges from a big data slip to molesting his sister?Nothing has changed. That is the part that needs transparency and its lack is bewildering. reply upwardbound 1 hour agorootparentOne of the comments here had a good possible explanation which is that sharing the details might expose the board to liability since they now would have admitted that they know the details of some illicit thing Sam did, for which a lawsuit is coming.For example, one scenario someone in a different thread conjectured is that Sam was secretly green-lighting the intentional (rather than incidental) collection of large amounts of copyrighted training data, exposing the firm to a great risk of a lawsuit from the media industry.If he hid this from the board, “not being candid” would be the reason for his firing, but if the board admits that they know the details of the malfeasance, they could become entangled in the litigation. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentprevBut if the board seems to be doing everything they can to make sure that longterm OpenAI wouldn’t be able to execute anything in their charter in a meaningful way (assuming they end up being left behind technologically and not that relevant) does it really make that much sense? reply rightbyte 24 minutes agorootparentWhat does a potential future scenario matter?

They want to work there, because that&#x27;s where ground zero is - both from the theoretical and applied point of view.It&#x27;s the ML&#x2F;AI equivalent of working at CERN - you could pay the researchers nothing, or everything, and many wouldn&#x27;t care - as long as they get to work on the things they are passionate about, AND they get to work with some of the most talented and innovative colleagues in the world. For these, it is likely more important to have top ML&#x2F;AI heads in the organization, than a commercially-oriented CEO like Sam.On the other side, you have the folks that are mostly chasing prestige and money. They see OpenAI as some sort of springboard into the elite world of top ML, where they&#x27;ll spend a couple of years building cred, before launching startups, becoming VP&#x2F;MD&#x2F;etc. at big companies, etc. - all while making good money.For the latter group, losing commercial momentum could indeed affect their will to work there.

He thinks for cost and economics reasons it&#x27;s much more feasible to build or train other parts and have them work together, because that&#x27;s much cheaper in terms of compute. As an example, with a big enough model, enough work, and the right mix of data you could probably have an LMM interpret speech just as well as Whisper can. But how much work does it take to make that happen without losing other capabilities? How efficient is the resulting huge model? Is the end result better than having the text&#x2F;intelligence segment separate from the speech and hearing segment? The answer could be yes, depending, but it could also be no.

If a \"top researcher\" is in favor of not researching, then they&#x27;re not a researcher. If a researcher doesn&#x27;t want to ship anything they research, they&#x27;re also not a researcher.OpenAI has shipped nothing so far that is in any way suggesting the end of humanity or other such apocalyptic scenario. In total, these AI models have great potency in making our media, culture, civilization a mess of autogenerated content, and they can be very disruptive in a negative way. But no SINGLE COMPANY is in control of this.

With the initial adoption of ChatGPT alongside Copilot, OpenAI&#x27;s data moat of crawled data & RLHF is pretty vast. And that&#x27;s not leaving the walled garden of OpenAI. You can simulate a lot of this using other off-the-shelf LLMs (see Alpaca) but nothing is a substitute for real world observed usage.In a related note, has this meaningfully broken through to the mainstream yet?

Almost every programming language (other than Microsoft&#x27;s own SDKs) gets developed on Linux, has first class support for Linux and Windows is always an afterthought.It has gone to that extent that to lure developers, Microsoft has to embed a Lunux in a virtual machine on Windows called WSL.Local inference is going to get cheaper and affordable and that&#x27;s for sure.New models would also emerge.So OpenAI doesn&#x27;t seem to have an IP that can withstand all that IMHO. reply bongodongobob 2 hours agorootparentLinux isn&#x27;t the workhorse in any business that isn&#x27;t tech based. The dev bubble here is pretty strong. I&#x27;ve done IT for a couple MSPs now so I&#x27;ve seen 100s of different tech stacks. No one uses Linux for anything. ESXi for the hypervisors, various version of Windows server, and M365 for everything else. Graphics&#x2F;marketing uses Macs sometimes but other than that, it&#x27;s all Windows&#x2F;MS.

There was a lot of effort behind putting across the perception that the board was going to resign and that Altman was going to come back.Looked at through that lens, it makes more sense: the existing board had little incentive to quit and rehire Sam&#x2F;Greg.

    "originBody": "Deep Learning Course You can find here slides, recordings, and a virtual machine for François Fleuret's deep-learning courses 14x050 of the University of Geneva, Switzerland. This course is a thorough introduction to deep-learning, with examples in the PyTorch framework: machine learning objectives and main challenges, tensor operations, automatic differentiation, gradient descent, deep-learning specific techniques, generative, recurrent, attention models. You can check the pre-requisites. This course was developped initialy at the Idiap Research Institute in 2018, and taught as EE-559 at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne until 2022. The notes for the handouts were added with the help of Olivier Canévet. Thanks to Adam Paszke, Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier, Alexandre Nanchen, Xavier Glorot, Andreas Steiner, Matus Telgarsky, Diederik Kingma, Nikolaos Pappas, Soumith Chintala, and Shaojie Bai for their answers or comments. In addition to the materials available here, I also wrote and distribute \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\", a phone-formatted short introduction to deep learning for readers with a STEM background. Lecture materials The slide pdfs are the ones I use for the lectures. They are in landscape format with overlays to facilitate the presentation. The handout pdfs are compiled without these fancy effects in portrait orientation, with additional notes. The screencasts are available both as in-browser streaming or downloadable mp4 files. You can get archives with all the pdf files (1097 slides): dlc-handout-all.zip (101.6Mb) dlc-slides-all.zip (101.6Mb) and subtitles for the screencasts generated automaticallly with OpenAI's Whisper: dlc-video-subtitles.zip (502.1Kb) or the individual lectures: 1.

Documentation You may have to look at the Python, Jupyter notebook, and PyTorch documentations at https://docs.python.org/ https://jupyter.org/ https://pytorch.org/docs/ Practical session prologue Helper Python prologue for the practical sessions: dlc_practical_prologue.py Argument parsing This prologue parses command-line arguments as follows usage: dummy.py [-h] [--full] [--tiny] [--seed SEED] [--cifar] [--data_dir DATA_DIR] DLC prologue file for practical sessions. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --full Use the full set, can take ages (default False) --tiny Use a very small set for quick checks (default False) --seed SEED Random seed (default 0, < 0 is no seeding) --cifar Use the CIFAR data-set and not MNIST (default False) --data_dir DATA_DIR Where are the PyTorch data located (default $PYTORCH_DATA_DIR or './data') Loading data The prologue provides the function load_data(cifar = None, one_hot_labels = False, normalize = False, flatten = True) which downloads the data when required, reshapes the images to 1d vectors if flatten is True, and narrows to a small subset of samples if --full is not selected. It returns a tuple of four tensors: train_data, train_target, test_data, and test_target. If cifar is True, the data-base used is CIFAR10, if it is False, MNIST is used, if it is None, the argument --cifar is taken into account. If one_hot_labels is True, the targets are converted to 2d torch.Tensor with as many columns as there are classes, and -1 everywhere except the coefficients [n, y_n], equal to 1. If normalize is True, the data tensors are normalized according to the mean and variance of the training one. If flatten is True, the data tensors are flattened into 2d tensors of dimension N × D, discarding the image structure of the samples. Otherwise they are 4d tensors of dimension N × C × H × W. Minimal example import dlc_practical_prologue as prologue train_input, train_target, test_input, test_target = prologue.load_data() print('train_input', train_input.size(), 'train_target', train_target.size()) print('test_input', test_input.size(), 'test_target', test_target.size()) prints * Using MNIST ** Reduce the data-set (use --full for the full thing) ** Use 1000 train and 1000 test samples train_input torch.Size([1000, 784]) train_target torch.Size([1000]) test_input torch.Size([1000, 784]) test_target torch.Size([1000]) Virtual Machine A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software that simulates a complete computer. The one we provide here includes a Linux operating system and all the tools needed to use PyTorch from a web browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome). Installation Download and install Oracle's VirtualBox, download the virtual machine OVA package (1.68Gb), and open the latter in VirtualBox with File → Import Appliance. You should now see an entry in the list of VMs. The first time it starts, it provides a menu to choose the keyboard layout you want to use (you can force the configuration later by running the command sudo set-kbd). If the VM does not start and VirtualBox complains that the VT-x is not enabled, you have to activate the virtualization capabilities of your CPU in the BIOS of your computer. Using the VM The VM automatically starts a JupyterLab on port 8888 and exports that port to the host. This means that you can access this JupyterLab with a web browser on the machine running VirtualBox at http://localhost:8888/ and use Python notebooks, view files, start terminals, and edit source files. Typing !bye in a notebook or bye in a terminal will shutdown the VM. You can run a terminal and a text editor from inside the Jupyter notebook for exercises that require more than the notebook itself. Source files can be executed by running in a terminal the Python command with the source file name as argument. Both can be done from the main Jupyter window with: New → Text File to create the source code, or selecting the file and clicking Edit to edit an existing one. New → Terminal to start a shell from which you can run Python. This VM also exports an ssh port to the port 2022 on the host, which allows to log in with standard ssh clients on Linux and OSX, and with applications such as PuTTY on Windows. The default login is 'dave' and password 'dummy', same password for the root account. Remarks Note that performance for computation will be very poor compared to installing PyTorch natively on your machine. In particular, the VM does not take advantage of a GPU if you have one. Finally, please also note that this VM is configured in a convenient but highly non-secured manner, with easy to guess passwords, including for the root, and network-accessible non-protected Jupyter notebooks. This VM is built on a Linux Debian, with miniconda, PyTorch, MNIST, CIFAR10, and many Python utility packages installed.

Someone mentioned there weren&#x27;t prereqs, I think, but man I was totally lost in the first class. reply PheonixPharts 14 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re interested in Deep Learning or any area of ML it&#x27;s fairly safe to assume you have a background in linear algebra, probability, calculus and obviously some basic programming.If you&#x27;re not interested in learning these areas, it&#x27;s also safe to say you aren&#x27;t really interested in deep learning either. Which is not to say if you don&#x27;t already know these areas you aren&#x27;t interested in deep learning, but if you don&#x27;t know them and are interested in deep learning you&#x27;re likely already studying them.I say this because deep learning and the vast majority of ML really just boil down to an application of these basic tools. Deep learning&#x2F;ML without the linear algebra, probability theory, calculus and coding isn&#x27;t really anything at all. reply apwell23 13 hours agorootparent> background in linear algebra, probability, calculusCurious. What does &#x27;background&#x27; mean in this sentence. You can spend years studying just one of these in depth. How much is \"enough\" for ML? reply pedrosorio 12 hours agorootparentThe basics. 1 semester course for each. reply apwell23 11 hours agorootparentthanks! I wonder if someone has compiled a resource with just enough math for ML. reply patrick451 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d say slightly more. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I attended a state school, but I think my first semester calculus class was all single variable (20 years ago now, so my memory is rusty). You really to understand gradients and jacobians for ML, which I think was calc III for me.

Sorry I thought the implication was that this one fell short (as some of the other comments seem to suggest).Thanks! replyKydlaw 11 hours agoprevLots of great resources listed here. But I think there is \"Understanding Deep Learning\" missing from the list [0]. In my opinion, Simon J.D. Prince accomplished a true feat with his book, not only through the material itself but also with the notes attached to each chapter, linking directly to advanced references (free literature review), exercises that really challenge your understanding of the material, and great notebooks with code that truly materialized the concepts learned (free exercises to give to students if you teach a DL class, but this community is probably not the targeted audience for that).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;udlbook.github.io&#x2F;udlbook&#x2F; reply lhl 22 hours agoprevFor those interested in this course, be sure to check out his Little Book of Deep Learning as well! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fleuret.org&#x2F;francois&#x2F;lbdl.html reply asicsp 22 hours agoprevSee also: Practical Deep Learning for Coders https:&#x2F;&#x2F;course.fast.ai&#x2F; reply knicholes 19 hours agoparentWhen Jeremy Howard wasn&#x27;t named on the top 100 AI list, it blew my mind.

We definitely didn&#x27;t cover this my signals and systems class in EE in either grad school or undergrad. reply npalli 15 hours agoprev [–] These Deep Learning (and ML) courses are turning into the equivalent of productivity tools. Many are very high quality but won&#x27;t turn you into a ML&#x2F;DL expert. The core issue is you need to be spend the time to complete, learn and apply in your own settings. That internal drive is something beyond what these can do and that&#x27;s the crux of the issue. People keep hoping some magic course will do it for them, but just like the productivity tools, there is no golden or silver bullet. Good old fashioned sit on your butt and do the work ;-). reply cinntaile 14 hours agoparent [–] What does this have to do with productivity tools? This is based on a university course that teaches you the fundamentals of deep learning. Of course it won&#x27;t turn you into a ML&#x2F;DL expert, that&#x27;s not the point. Anyone completing this course on their own in their free time definitely has the internal drive that you say is lacking so I honestly don&#x27;t get your comment at all. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Friends Don't Let Friends Make Bar Plots for Means Separation This has to be the first one. Means separation plots are some of the most common in scientific publications. We have two or more groups, which contains multiple observations; they may have different means, variances, and distributions. The task of the visualization is to show the means and the spread (dispersion) of the data. In this example, two groups have similar means and standard deviations, but quite different distributions. Are they really \"the same\"? Just don't use bar plot for means separation, or at least check a couple things before settling down on a bar plot. It's worth mentioning that I was inspired by many researchers who have tweeted on the limitation of bar graphs. Here is a pulication: Weissgerber et al., 2015, PLOS Biology. 2. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Violin Plots for Small Sample Sizes This is quite common in the literature as well, but unfortunately, violin plots (or any sort of smoothed distribution curves) make no sense for small n. Distributions and quartiles can vary widely with small n, even if the underlying observations are similar. Distribution and quartiles are only meaningful with large n. I did an experiment before, where I sampled the same normal distribution several times and computed the quartiles for each sample. The quartiles only stablize when n gets larger than 50. 3. Friends Don't Let Friends Use Bidirectional Color Scales for Unidirectional Data Excuse my language, but this is a truly data visualization sin, and again quite common. I can understand why this error is common, because it appears that many of us have not spent a lot of thoughts on this issue. Color scales are pretty, but we have to be extra careful. When color scales (or color gradients) are used to represent numerical data, the darkest and lightest colors should have special meanings. You can decide what those special meanings are: e.g., max, min, mean, zero. But they should represent something meaningful. A data visualization sin for heat maps/color gradients is when the lightest or darkers colors are some arbitrary numbers. This is as bad as the longest bar in a bar chart not being the largest value. Can you imagine that? 4. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Bar Plot Meadow We talked about no bar charts for mean separation, but this is a different issue. It has to do with presenting results of a multi-factorial experiment. Bar plot meadows are very common in scientific publications and unfortunately also ineffective in communicating the results. Data from: Matand et al., 2020, BMC Plant Biology Bar plot meadows are common because multi-factorial experiments are common. However, a bar plot meadow is poorly designed for its purpose. To communicate results of a multi-factorial experiment, it requires thoughtful designs regarding grouping/faceting by factors of interest. In this example, I focus on comparing the effect of Treatment & Explant on Response at the level of each Variety. However, if the focus is the effect of Treatment & Variety on Response at the level of each Exaplant, then it will require a different layout. 5. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Heatmap without (Considering) Reordering Rows & Columns Heatmaps are very common in scientific publications, and very very common in omics papers. However, for heatmaps to be effective, we have to consider the ordering of rows & columns. In this example, I have cells as columns and features as rows. Grids are showing z scores. It is impossible to get anything useful out of the heatmap without reordering rows and columns. We can reorder rows and columns using clustering, but that is not the only way. Of course, if the rows and columns are mapping to physical entities (rows and columns of a 96-well plate), then you can't reorder them. But it is a very good idea to at least consider reordering rows and columns. Data from: Li et al., 2022, BioRxiv Bonus: heatmaps can be very pretty ...if you are good are reordering rows/columns and choosing color gradients. Here is an example \"abstract aRt\" generated from simulated data. R code for this aRt piece can be found here. For a tutorial on how to reorder rows and columns of a heatmap, see this markdown file. 6. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Heatmap without Checking Outliers Outliers in heatmap can really change how we perceive and interpret the visualization. This generalizes to all sort of visualizations that use colors to represent numeric data. Let me show you an example: In this example, I have 2 observations. For each observations, I measured 20 features. Without checking for outliers, it may appear that the 2 observations are overall similar, except at 2 features. However, after maxing out the color scale around 95th percentile of the data, it reveals that the two observations are distinct across all features. 7. Friends Don't Let Friends Forget to Check Data Range at Each Factor Level This is a common issue that many of us have encountered. In a multifactor experiment, sometimes the range of the response variable changes widely between different factor levels. This hypothetical experiment measured 3 compounds across 2 groups (control vs. treatment). Without checking data range for each compound, you will likely have missed that the treatment had a strong effect on compound 1. This is because the concentration of compound 1 has a much narrower range than the other compounds in this experiment. 8. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Network Graphs without Trying Different Layouts Network graphs are common in scientific publications. They are super useful in presenting relationship data. However, the apparence (not the topology) of the network can make a huge difference in determing if a network graph is effective. Layouts can drastically change the appearance of networks, making them easier or harder to interpret. Here are 3 network graphs from the same data. They look very different from each other. Data from: Li et al., 2022, BioRxiv 9. Friends Don't Let Friends Confuse Position-based Visualizations with Length-based Visualizations This is always the elephant in the room and the essence of many misleading visualizations. In this example, I measured a response variable across 3 time points. Two of the following graphs are fine, but one of them is a data visualization crime. Can you see why? In dot and line plots, values are represented by positions along the x and y axis. The same idea applies to other position based visualizations, such as box plots. In bar plots, values are represented by the distance from the x axis, and thus the length of the bar. The 3rd graph is not 0-based, which makes the bar length at time point 2 about 3x longer than that at time point 1. In fact, the true difference in means is closer to 1.6x. I hope you can see how confusing length and position based visualizations can lead to misleading graphs. Watch out for bar plots with broken axis Broken axis may be useful for depicting data across a wide range of numeric values. (Alternatively, log scaled axis can be used instead.) Broken axis are fine for position based graphics, because the data are represented by positions along the axis. However, we must be very careful with bar plots that have broken axis. Here is an example. In this example, two graphs (left vs. right) are showing the same data. However, by changing where the axis is broken, one can make certain bars looks longer or shorter. In this example, the length of bar \"d\" can look really different. The illusion of bar \"d\" being very short on the right graph boils down to bar plot being a length based graphics, not a position based graphics. Example R code for broken axis can be found here. 10. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Pie Chart Pie chart is a common type of visualization for fractional data, where fractions add up to 100%. This is achieved by dividing a circle into sectors, and the sectors add up to a full circle. Pie charts have been criticized, because human are much worse in reading angles and area than reading lengths. Here is a blog post that explores that. In this example, we have two groups, each contains 4 sub-categories. In classic pie charts, the angles (and thus arc lengths & sector area) represent the data. The problem is that it is very difficult to compare between groups. We can visually simplify the pie chart into donut charts, where the data are now represented by arc lengths. However, if we want to use lengths to represent the data, why don't we just unwrap the donut and make stacked bars? In stacked bar graphs, bars are shown side-by-side and thus easier to compare across groups. Fun fact: the scripts underlying stacked bars are much simpler than those underlying the pie charts and donut charts. If you want to produce sub-optimal graph types with ggplot, you actually have to work extra hard. 11. Friends Don't Let Friends Make Concentric Donuts In this example, we have 3 groups, each of which contains two sub-categories (Type I or Type II). In concentric donuts, you might be tempted to say the data are represented by the arc lengths, which is in fact inaccurate. The arc lengths on the outer rings are much longer than those in the inner rings. Group 2 and Group 3 have the same exact values, but the arc lengths of Group 3 are much longer. In fact the data are represented by the arc angles, which we are bad at reading. Since outer rings are longer, the ordering of the groups (which group goes to which ring) has a big impact on the impression of the plot. It can lead to the apparent paradox where larger values have shorter arcs. The better (and simpler!) alternative is just unwrap the donuts and make a good old stacked bar plot. BTW, this is also my main issue with circos plots and other circular plot layouts. 12. Friends Don't Let Friends Use Red/Green and Rainbow color scales Deuteranomaly is the most common type of red/green colorblindness, occurring in 1/16 male and 1/256 female. Any color scales that use shades of red and shades of green in the same time would be a problem for a person with red/green colorblindness (third column of the figure). In addition, red/green and rainbow do not preserve information well at all when printed on black/white (grey scale, second column in figure). Many scientific software still use red/green or rainbow as the default color scales, which drives me crazy. More \"modern\" color scales, such as viridis are both colorblind-friendly and grey scale-safe (third row of figure). And they look nice too. 13. Friends Don't Let Friends Forget to Reorder Stacked Bar Plot Stacked bar plots are useful for visualizing proportion data. Stacked bar plots are commonly used to visualize community structure or population structure or admixture analysis. This kind of visualization boils down to a collection of samples, where each sample contains multiple classes of members. However, when we have many samples and many classes, stacked bar plots need to be optimized to be effective. And by \"optimize\" I mean the grouping and ordering of samples. Here we have an example data with 100 samples and 8 classes of member. Due to the number of samples and classes, it is very hard to discern anything from this graph without optimizing the order of bars. What the heck am I looking at? After reordering the bars, wow, that really made a difference, don't you think? For a tutorial on how to optimize a stack bar plot, see this script. Conclusion (?) That's it for now. I will update this when I have the time (and inspirations) to produce more examples. Not sure what the next one will be, but stay tuned!",

It&#x27;s also very frequent in stats visualisations in videogames. If you play strategy or simulation games they often have visualisations to help the player understand what&#x27;s going on&#x2F;wrong, but for heatmaps because of the effect of outliers the heatmap gradient is often pretty useless. For example in the game oxygen not included, frequently if you do the temperature viz, everything just turns to either blue or some shade of pinky-red, because if you have a volcano or other heat source all the other colours seem cool. So you can&#x27;t distinguish between a 1000C volcano and your slightly overheating 270C steam room for instance, they&#x27;ll just be a pretty uniform shade of pinky red, and your overheating 60C base will be blue because it&#x27;s pretty cold relative to them. Meaning that heatmap is pretty much useless for diagnosing a bunch of temperature problems.[1] Can&#x27;t remember the exact wording but that one it&#x27;s like number 6 or 7. reply nichevo 4 minutes agoparentWouldn&#x27;t log-transforming the data be a suitable solution here? Unless monitoring the temperature of the volcano is outside interest, in which case excluding it or marking it as an outlier indeed would be apropriate. reply mcv 1 hour agoparentprevIf specific temperatures represent a meaningful problem, your colours should be standardised to show those temperatures, and not be automatically generated out of the whole spectrum of temperatures you currently have. In fact, having the meaning of colours change depending on temperature changes sounds like a pretty bad idea. reply crazygringo 9 hours agoprevOn the one hand, this all seems pretty great.On the other hand, I think a lot of these \"bad graphs\" are very intentionally chosen precisely in order to hide the small number of data points, or an underlying distribution that looks suspicious, etc.So it&#x27;s not so much \"friends don&#x27;t let friends\", but more \"when you see a graph that chooses to obfuscate rather than clarify, suspect it might be intentional\". reply tgv 58 minutes agoparentIt definitely happens intentionally and unintentionally in psych literature, certainly the first one. Psych articles report p values over ANOVAs, and they blithely assume everything is normally distributed. For one group, there&#x27;s absolutely no need to poke the sleeping dog. The other group simply has no idea. They shouldn&#x27;t be doing research, but their training is lacking, and cheap PhDs aren&#x27;t that easy to come by, so here we are. reply taspeotis 8 hours agoparentprevYeah both AMD and NVIDIA churn out some pretty shit graphs year on year.

They&#x27;re rushed, they&#x27;re given no time to actually improve their work, and the emphasis is entirely on &#x27;good-enough&#x27; publications. The number of times I&#x27;ve been involved in a paper where the mentality wasn&#x27;t \"get it out the door, now\" is.... zero times.Plots often fail to clarify for the precise reason that clarification takes time and effort and those things are lacking in academia in spades. Are people intentionally hiding ugly details, definitely on occasion? But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the primary source of such bad figures. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparentAll that you said with a heavy dash of good data visualisation is more of a skill and an artform than many people realise.I&#x27;ve had four decades of crunching numbers in a variety of Engineering, Geophysics, and science applications with a hefty amount of public consulting on a variety of applications and of the large population of those good at gathering and recording data perhaps only 20% had that extra talent for good visualisation to convey meaning without distortion. reply ctxc 5 hours agorootparentAre there resources or good examples you would recommend? reply frederikb 2 hours agorootparentI really enjoyed Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic.

I also recommend looking at it.But the central premise the text presents is \"maximise the information to ink ratio\", which sounds very reasonable but is fundamentally flawed. The problem is that quantity of ink (or, on a screen, number of black pixels) is not the same as visual complexity. By the time your brain is interpreting something visual, it has done edge detection, grouping, and other preprocessing.He gives an example of shortening the axes on a scatter plot to show the range of data, rather than intersecting at the corner. This is win-win because it uses less ink but shows more information. But, when I look at the comparison, it&#x27;s just obvious that the modified version is visually more complex. It would be especially worse on a complex page with text and a few plots next to each other – the fragments would all visually bleed together.One mitigation to that sort of complexity is to put boxes around large district elements, like an entire plot. But boxes are Tufte&#x27;s absolute nemesis, in that book and elsewhere. It&#x27;s surprising that after so many years looking at visual displays he still has that attitude. reply 3abiton 3 hours agorootparentDo you have alternative book recommendations? reply quietbritishjim 1 hour agorootparentAfraid not. I only found out about Tufte&#x27;s book due to a mention in xkcd. Until Randall mentions another book about plots I&#x27;m not likely to find one :-)It would be nice to find someone like Tufte that gathered some actual evidence. Like, trying different plots on groups of people to see which find information faster, maybe using eye tracking. Even just subjective surveys might be an improvement on one person&#x27;s opinion. reply stiff 1 hour agorootparentWilliam Cleveland did some research along those lines and he wrote two good books: - The elements of graphing data - Visualizing dataThe first one is of general interest, the second one more specialized for statisticians. reply contrarian1234 3 hours agoparentprevI think he has an insightful framework for thinking about what makes good data visualizationHowever I feel a lot of people miss the logic behind it all and just straight up copy the \"Tuft style\" which often is too stylized and iconoclastic. A good example are the plotting defaults in R&#x27;s ggplot2 reply ppqqrr 5 hours agoprevA while ago i had a heated discussion on HN with someone who claimed that any graph where 0 is not the minimum value of all the axes is misleading.We were talking about a graph that shows global temperature rise due to climate change. They claimed the graph was misleading because the Y axis (temperature) didn&#x27;t start from 0 (fahrenheit? celsius? fucking kelvin?).This person also quipped, \"maybe if you can&#x27;t see if with 0 at the bottom, it&#x27;s not such a significant change?\". That put a dent in my faith in humanity for a while. I&#x27;m just glad to see us operating at a higher level.

The goal is to have a graph with as little useless ink as possible; where every bit of information visible in a graph (or table) is relevant to the end output. To this extent, he recommended dumping axis lines where unneeded, labels, keys, gridlines, and many more things.LaTeX tables, by default, tend to look like what Tufte proposed, which is probably why LaTeX tables look so damn good compared to the HTML defaults reply TehShrike 6 hours agoparentWhile reading chapter 6 of that book, I was inspired to make this digital scatter graph trying to implement his \"data-ink maximization\" principle: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tehshrike.github.io&#x2F;classy-graph&#x2F;It was a good exercise.I really like that book. reply baazaa 5 hours agoprevNever understood the hate for pie charts when stacked bar charts have a similar problem (hard to compare groups when they&#x27;re in different positions).

    "title": "datetime.utcnow() Deprecation in Python 3.12: Beware of Timezone Issues",
    "originLink": "https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/it-s-time-for-a-change-datetime-utcnow-is-now-deprecated",
    "originBody": "miguelgrinberg.com Home My Courses and Books Consulting About Me It's Time For A Change: datetime.utcnow() Is Now Deprecated Posted by on November 18, 2023 under I was going through the release notes of the new Python 3.12 version the other day, and one item caught my attention in the deprecations section: datetime.datetime’s utcnow() and utcfromtimestamp() are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. If you have followed my web development tutorials you must have seen me use utcnow() a lot, so I will clearly need to re-train myself to use an alternative, in preparation for the eventual removal of this function (likely a few years out, so no need to panic!). In this short article I'll tell you more about why these functions are getting the axe, and what to replace them with. What's Wrong with utcnow() and utcfromtimestamp()? The problem that the Python maintainers have found comes from the fact that these functions return \"naive\" datetime objects. A naive datetime object is one that does not have a timezone, which means that it can only be used in a context where the timezone does not matter or is already known in advance. This is in contrast to \"aware\" datetime objects, which do have a timezone attached to them explicitly. If you ask me, I think the names of these functions are misleading. A function that is called utcnow() should be expected to return UTC datetimes, as implied by the name. I would have made it more clear that these functions work with naive time, maybe by calling them naive_utcnow() and naive_utcfromtimestamp(). But their names are not the problem here. The specific issue is that some Python date and time functions accept naive timestamps and assume that they represent local time, according to the timezone that is configured on the computer running the code. There is a GitHub issue from 2019 that provides some background into this, with the following example: >>> from datetime import datetime >>> dt = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(0) >>> dt datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0) >>> dt.timestamp() 18000 The example above was executed on a computer that was configured for Eastern Standard Time (EST). First, dt is assigned a naive datetime that is converted from the \"zero\" time or UNIX epoch, which is January 1st, 1970 at midnight. When this object is converted back to a timestamp, the dt.timestamp() method finds that it does not have a timezone to use in the conversion, so it uses the computer's own timezone, which in this example was EST (note that the EST timezone is 5 hours, or 18,000 seconds behind UTC). So we have a UNIX timestamp that originated as midnight on January 1st, 1970, and after being converted to a datetime and back ends up as 5 am. If you read the issue linked above, they suggest that this ambiguity did not exist in Python 2 and for that reason this was not a problem for a long time, but it now is and needs to be addressed. This sounded strange, so I had to go and check, and sure enough, the timestamp() method that returns the incorrect UNIX time in the example was introduced in Python 3.3 and nothing similar appears to have existed back in Python 2 times. So basically, at some point they've added a datetime.timestamp() method (and possibly others as well) that accept both aware and naive datetimes and this was a mistake, because these methods must have a timezone to work. These methods should have been designed to fail when a naive datetime object is passed to them, but for some strange reason they decided that when a timezone is not provided the timezone from the system should be used. This is really the bug, but instead of fixing the broken implementations of these methods they are now trying to force people to move to aware datetimes by deprecating the two main functions that generate naive ones. They think that because a few functions assume that naive timestamps represent local times, all naive uses that are not in local time should be discouraged. I may be missing something here, but I don't really follow this logic. Do We Need Naive Datetimes Anyway? To me it is clear that the Python maintainers behind this deprecation have a problem with naive datetimes and are using this supposed problem as an excuse to cripple them. So why would you want to work with naive datetimes in the first place? An application may be designed in such a way that all dates and times are in a single timezone that is known in advance. In this case there is no need for individual datetime instances to carry their own timezones, since this uses more memory and processing power for no benefit, since all these timezones would be the same and it would never be necessary to perform timezone math or conversions. This is actually very common in web applications or other types of networking servers, which are configured with UTC time and normalize all dates and times to this timezone when they enter the system. It is also a best practice to store naive datetimes representing UTC in databases. The DateTime type in SQLAlchemy represents a naive datetime object by default, for example. This is such a common database pattern that SQLAlchemy provides a recipe for applications that use aware datetime objects to convert these to and from naive ones on the fly as they are saved to or loaded from the database. So yes, I expect naive datetime objects will continue to be used, in spite of these deprecations. Updating Your Code Even though the deprecations are disappointing, it is important to keep in mind that it may take a few years for the functions to actually be removed. The problem is that once you switch to Python 3.12 or newer you will start seeing deprecation messages on your console and your logs, and these can get annoying. Here is an example of what you can expect to see: $ python Python 3.12.0 (main, Oct 5 2023, 10:46:39) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> from datetime import datetime >>> datetime.utcnow() :1: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version. Use timezone-aware objects to represent datetimes in UTC: datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC). datetime.datetime(2023, 11, 18, 11, 22, 54, 263206) I'm only using Python 3.12 in a small number of projects, and I'm already tired of seeing these warnings. So let's go ahead and look at how these two functions can be replaced. The advice from the Python maintainers is to switch to aware datetime objects. The deprecation warning provides a hint of what they think we should use, and the deprecation notices included in the documentation are even more specific. Here is what the notice for the utcnow() function says: Deprecated since version 3.12: Use datetime.now() with UTC instead. Below you can see the one for utcfromtimestamp(): Deprecated since version 3.12: Use datetime.fromtimestamp() with UTC instead. So this gives us an idea of what can be done. Here are my custom versions of the deprecated functions, with the additional option to choose between aware or naive implementations: from datetime import datetime, timezone def aware_utcnow(): return datetime.now(timezone.utc) def aware_utcfromtimestamp(timestamp): return datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, timezone.utc) def naive_utcnow(): return aware_utcnow().replace(tzinfo=None) def naive_utcfromtimestamp(timestamp): return aware_utcfromtimestamp(timestamp).replace(tzinfo=None) print(aware_utcnow()) print(aware_utcfromtimestamp(0)) print(naive_utcnow()) print(naive_utcfromtimestamp(0)) Note that if you are using Python 3.11 or newer, you can replace datetime.timezone.utc with a shorter datetime.UTC. Running this script I get the following results: 2023-11-18 11:36:35.137639+00:00 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 2023-11-18 11:36:35.137672 1970-01-01 00:00:00 You can tell that the first and second lines show aware datetime instances from the +00:00 suffix that indicates that the timezone is 00:00 or UTC. The third and fourth lines show abstract timestamps without a timezone, fully compatible with those returned by the deprecated functions. What I like about these implementations is that they give you the choice to work with or without timezones, removing any ambiguity. Explicit is better than implicit, as the old adage says.

It is also a best practice to store naive datetimes representing UTC in databases. If you store \"naive datetimes representing UTC\" in your DB then doesn't that clash with Python's naive datetimes? Python's naive datetimes are usually assumed to represent local time rather than UTC, unless they come from these two funny functions. If all the times in your DB are in UTC then the right type to use in python is a datetime with datetime.UTC attached, not a naive one. Similarly, if you want to convert all times to UTC on the way into your web application as you say is best practice, then once you've done so the result should be a datetime with datetime.UTC attached not a naive one. (It may be the case that the whole webserver is configured to be in UTC time so these are more or less the same, but it's still better to be explicit just like it's better to encode all your text in UTF-8 instead of using the system locale.) #2 Miguel Grinberg said 19 hours ago @Alex: I get what you are saying, but the idea that naive datetimes represent local time is fairly recent, and only put to practice in a handful of functions. The Python 3.12 documentation has what I consider the correct definition for naive datetime objects: A naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive object represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time in some other timezone is purely up to the program, just like it is up to the program whether a particular number represents metres, miles, or mass. Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality. So there is really no clash. As long as you know that you are working with naive datetimes and only perform operations that do not require knowing the timezone (which in my opinion is a pre-requisite to working with naive datetimes), there is absolutely no problem. I can turn the argument around and say that it really makes no sense to use a naive datetime to represent a local time, since you can explicitly state that you want local time by storing the local timezone in the object. The footgun exists from both sides of the argument. #3 Jeffry Babb said 18 hours ago Hmmm, I don't know, the very purpose of UTC is to create a reference, so a \"naive\" datetime should have always defaulted to UTC + 0. #4 Miguel Grinberg said 18 hours ago @Jeffry: No, that was never the intention. There is already a way to represent UTC timestamps as aware datetimes, and that works well. A naive datetime does not specify a timezone. This works for applications that do not care about timezones, or for applications that know what timezone they want to use already. #5 Caroline Smith said 17 hours ago You Python programmers don't know how good you've got it! I'd love to only have to deal with \"problems\" like the one you're describing. About six months ago, I was given some Rust software to maintain, and it has been one of the worst experiences of my professional life. Everything is a disaster, especially anything involving crates. So many of them are unmaintained, and so many of them are rubbish and full of bugs to begin with. Even if Python has some legacy quirks, at least what's there is pretty darn good to begin with, and it's getting better and better with each new release. Frankly, I'm about to rewrite this damn Rust software in Python, I'm that frustrated with how awful it is. #6 Bolke said 16 hours ago The python datetimes where a mess to begin with and have been the culprit of many many many issues. Pytz made serious errors giving rise to Arrow and Pendulum. Naive objects should have never existed at all. \"naive_utcnow\" is an oxymoron. There is no such thing. \"An application may be designed in such a way that all dates and times are in a single timezone that is known in advance. In this case there is no need for individual datetime instances to carry their own timezones, since this uses more memory and processing power for no benefit, since all these timezones would be the same and it would never be necessary to perform timezone math or conversions.\" I worked in Finance where people assumed this for payment systems. The mess that this has become when trying to reconcile when it became needed to a certain point in the future is incredible. DST settings and time zones change quite regularly. Imagine what this would mean for cutoff times. So if you have a naive 'local' datetime object and you saved that to naive UTC how do you get it back to the local time zone? Indeed you need to re-add timezone information. \"This is actually very common in web applications or other types of networking servers, which are configured with UTC time and normalize all dates and times to this timezone when they enter the system. It is also a best practice to store naive datetimes representing UTC in databases. The DateTime type in SQLAlchemy represents a naive datetime object by default, for example. This is such a common database pattern that SQLAlchemy provides a recipe for applications that use aware datetime objects to convert these to and from naive ones on the fly as they are saved to or loaded from the database.\" The pattern is to only provide time zone aware datetimes where the user requires them, everywhere else it should be in UTC. So if you have an app in front of your database you can store datetimes in a naive format as long you are absolutely certain all your datetimes get transposed to UTC. Guess what: your databases doesn't do the conversion for you if the field is naive so your application needs to do so. #7 Julien Deniau said 16 hours ago The problem with naive timezone (as I understand in Python) is that people might use it not knowing what they are really working with, just because it's easy. But first of all, the name is misleading (as you do not get UTC). There is a obviously a problem when you change the timezone, and there will probably be a problem with DST too : what is the real time point of a naive date between 2 and 3 the date you go back from summer time to winter time? As you, and the old adage say: Explicit is better than implicit I totally agree with you on that one! The problem is fairly complex, I even made a conference on the timezone subject (and learned a lot preparing it 🤯) Thank you for your blog post, it does spread the time problem to everyone 👍 #8 Anon 1700418279 said 16 hours ago Hey Miguel 👋, would you mind to point a resource or link, in case you know, where is explained why python took the design decision to implement naive datetime using local timezone instead of UTC, I'm just curious. Thanks for the amazing and useful article. #9 Jonas L. B. said 13 hours ago It's not true that it's a \"fairly recent\" change to have naive timestamps represent local time. Might be a difference between Python 2 and 3, but that's ancient times, not recent times. You can also look at the real world - eg. look at your wall clock, your task bar, or the \"departures\" board of your local train station. You'll see naive times that you can assume to be local time. This isn't some obscene idea that the Python devs came up with - it's literally how the world works. It's also e.g. specified in ISO8601 that if no timezone it in a timestamp, then it's \"local time\". It's ok though, to have an in-database or in-memory representation that works differently. You can make your own rules for internal representation. But it makes good sense for the Python datetime API to work the way it does, considering that e.g. hour and minute are public attributes, and these make absolutely no sense without timezone information. #10 Miguel Grinberg said 10 hours ago @Bolke: I'm confused about the point you are trying to make. I'm not against aware datetimes, you do not have to sell them to me. I also have no problem if you think that naive datetimes are problematic. I worked in Finance where people assumed this for payment systems. Okay. So this isn't one of those applications for which naive datetimes are good. I never said naive datetimes should be used by every application. But you seem to be saying that nobody should use naive datetimes? #11 Miguel Grinberg said 10 hours ago @Anon: I have no idea. The documentation disagrees with this. Here is the definition of naive datetimes in Python 3.12's docs: A naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive object represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time in some other timezone is purely up to the program, just like it is up to the program whether a particular number represents metres, miles, or mass. Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality. The new interpretation of naive datetimes is something that must have grown organically and was never officially documented, at least not yet. #12 Miguel Grinberg said 10 hours ago @Jonas: It's not true that it's a \"fairly recent\" change to have naive timestamps represent local time. It's recent enough that this interpretation of what a naive datetime represents hasn't been documented yet. I copied it a few times already, but here it is once again, from the 3.12 documentation: A naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive object represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time in some other timezone is purely up to the program, just like it is up to the program whether a particular number represents metres, miles, or mass. Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality. But it makes good sense for the Python datetime API to work the way it does What do you mean? You do realize that the datetime API does not work in the way you are describing, and not even the documentation agrees with you? The datetime API is a mess with all of its inconsistencies. So I do not really understand why you are putting it as some sort of example. The reality is that we are having these discussions because of how bad the design of this API is. #13 Gasper said 2 hours ago Hey! The problem with timezones is that they are not related to time, but to jurisdiction, which is most commonly a country. UTC is a \"jurisdictionless\" time zone - no country is assigned UTC as its time zone, as it does not have control over it. This also means having timestamps in UTC is usually a sane thing to do, since all the other time zones are referenced to UTC, and converting from UTC to any time zone is only one step. Unfortunately, at over 200 contries in the world today, this means there is high probability that one jurisdiction will decide to change its time zone. Thus, you need to update tzinfo regularly. Even when tzinfo is updated, there are caveats with using UTC. Timestamps are only really valid for past time, not future, as if you have a calendar app and take your inputs in local timestamps, store them as UTC, and if you later display them in an updated local time zone, the hours might mismatch. I think that most of the use cases are probably better served by timestamps in UTC than anything else. Modelling time is hard. :D «« « » »» Leave a Comment Name Email Comment Captcha Flask Web Development, 2nd Edition If you want to learn modern web development techniques with Python and Flask, you may find the second edition of my O'Reilly book useful.

This was not some horrific burden for most companies using Python. The people who flamed Python for these breaking changes were either extreme outliers or the sort of people who would be happy with the language never making breaking changes, ever, no matter how bad of mistakes in design were discovered.I would strongly prefer that datetime.utcnow were not deprecated in a 3.x release, but instead deprecated along with the GIL and any other breaking changes, in Python 4.0. Yes, it would get them flamed. And the flamers are wrong. At least that way people can plan for the transition at their leisure instead of constantly worrying that a 3.x release will unexpectedly break their codebase if they don&#x27;t read the release notes before every update. reply Wowfunhappy 10 hours agoparent> The people who flamed Python for these breaking changes were either extreme outliers or the sort of people who would be happy with the language never making breaking changes, ever, no matter how bad of mistakes in design were discovered.Count me in the \"don&#x27;t make breaking changes\" camp. You can spit out warnings to prevent developers from using certain language features in new code, but changes which outright break old code should be extremely rare.This is how Javascript works (the language, not the ecosystem around it), and it means I can update my web browser and continue visiting old websites.I don&#x27;t think most languages should go as far as Javascript. However, the case for a breaking change should be a heck of a lot stronger than \"we think all timestamps should have timezones now.\" That&#x27;s a fine opinion to have, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you should go break stuff. reply derefr 10 hours agorootparent> However, the case for a breaking change should be a heck of a lot stronger than \"we think all timestamps should have timezones\".How about if you rephrase the case as \"we&#x27;ve sampled codebases that use naive timestamps, and at least 50% of them had critical bugs related to mistaken assumptions made about timezones by functions used to produce vs consume those timestamps. Your code is already broken. This update just makes the compiler force you to rewrite your code in a way that makes the errors obvious and&#x2F;or into type errors — and, therefore, which forces you to fix those bugs.\" reply Wowfunhappy 9 hours agorootparentPresumably this code works for me if I&#x27;m using it.

But what if I&#x27;m not the author and know nothing about the codebase? Is forcing me to make a naïve change to get things working again more likely to remove bugs or add them?The compiler can warn me that I probably have a bug and should change my code. But it shouldn&#x27;t hold the program hostage until I comply.This isn&#x27;t a blanket statement in favor of permissive compilers. It&#x27;s fine for the compiler to force good practices the first time. I just have a problem with the compiler going back and changing its mind later. reply zelos 1 hour agorootparentTimezone bugs are evil and crop up at the worst times, though.

Is attempting to make a naïve change, in a code base I don&#x27;t understand, likely to add or remove bugs?Anyone other than the developer of the code, shouldn&#x27;t be attempting to re-pin the runtime the code depends on to one with a different major ABI version.The problem, of course, is that most programming languages don&#x27;t have a concept of \"pinning the allowed runtime version like any other dependency\"; or of the runtime exposing an ABI version that increases for every breaking change. (This second could and should just be the SemVer major-version of the runtime; but for some reason projects aren&#x27;t fans of bumping their major versions for every little breaking change. Personally I think we should \"let marketing win\", and just allow projects to expose an ABI version independently.) reply naniwaduni 8 hours agorootparent> Sure, it all seems to work for now... and then a customer signs up from Tuvalu, and performs a billable action at 11:59PM on the last day of the month, and your whole billing system falls over because they now have a split invoice generated for next month while it&#x27;s still this month.You think there&#x27;s much of an overlap between systems that do time zone arithmetic with naive timestamps and ones that bill in the customer&#x27;s time zone? reply Wowfunhappy 9 hours agorootparentprev> Sure, it all seems to work for now... and then a customer signs up from Tuvalu, and performs a billable action at 11:59PM on the last day of the month, and your whole billing system falls over because they now have a split invoice generated for next month while it&#x27;s still this month.Yeah, so the compiler should issue a warning and the user can decide how to proceed. If the user ignores the warning for code that is part of their company&#x27;s billing system, that&#x27;s on them. Computers should provide information, but ultimately leave the humans in charge.> The problem, of course, is that most programming languages don&#x27;t have a concept of \"pinning the allowed runtime version like any other dependency\"; or of the runtime exposing an ABI version that increases for every breaking change.That&#x27;s an equally fine way to handle things IMO, but the language would need to support each runtime version more-or-less indefinitely. It also still doesn&#x27;t solve your problem with the customer in Tuvalu (which I think is fine, just pointing it out). reply throwaway290 3 hours agorootparentprev> Sure, it all seems to work for now... and then a customer signs up from Tuvalu, and performs a billable action at 11:59PM on the last day of the month, and your whole billing system falls over because they now have a split invoice generated for next month while it&#x27;s still this month.A one-off is not \"whole billing system falls over\".

Software development changes. The best way to guarantee that your entire codebase will become an obsolete monolith that eventually needs to get replaced is to make sure that you choose an ecosystem that isn&#x27;t growing and changing too.Yes, there are COBOL and Fortran and whatever else programs still running out there. But software is not mostly a \"one and done\" thing, and unless you&#x27;re confident you&#x27;re writing something that&#x27;s \"one and done\", then these comparisons are truly irrelevant. reply devjab 2 hours agorootparentprevDid they break stuff? One of the differences is that Python is versioned, so you should be capable of running your current version without issues and then update when you’re ready.While JavaScript itself is backwards compatible, in a few cases beyond good reason, it’s not really backwards compatible for most of its modern use cases. Node isn’t backwards compatible and neither is TypeScript, and neither are many frameworks as you point out.I do agree that making breaking changes shouldn’t become a thing, but at some points you also have to move things forward. That being said, I do think this particular case is a shift in philosophy more so than a step forward, since this is a far more opinionated change than what may have been the case previously in Python. reply Kwpolska 2 hours agorootparentYou may not always be in control of the Python version, for example if you depend on the Python provided by your OS. You may also want to use a newer Python version for its features, support (bugfixes) and libraries, so you&#x27;ll need to rewrite things.Java also has versions, but they generally don&#x27;t remove things. You can keep your ugly code and use the latest version of the language. reply Clamchop 11 hours agoparentprevA typical pattern is to deprecate in minor versions and remove in the next major version, encouraging gentle readiness for that major update. I don&#x27;t know enough about Python to say this is what they&#x27;re doing, but it fits in this case. reply OJFord 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not what they do, in semver terms you get breaking changes in minor version bumps.To be fair, as a result there&#x27;s maybe more resistance to making any such change than there otherwise would be, but in nicher standard lib modules there are API&#x2F;semantic changes from one version to another.I&#x27;d prefer semver, like it sounds GP would, but failing that I&#x27;d prefer totally owning that the version is fairly meaningless, and doing something like 2023.x as pip does for example. At least then everyone knows they should check for anything like that. (Not to mention it carries the additional age&#x2F;potentially out of date information.) reply selcuka 5 hours agorootparent> something like 2023.x as pip doesNot sure what you mean by that. The version of pip currently installed on my laptop is 23.3.1. Did you mean some other package, such as pytz? reply Mehdi2277 4 hours agorootparent23 comes from 2023.

That&#x27;s essentially what the python maintainers did: collectively demand tens of thousands of hours worth of labor from developers, labor that could have been spent doing something enjoyable or profitable, but instead was wasted on menial work because the Python developers thought some minor changes were worth breaking things for everyone. I.e. they put a much higher value on their own subjective ideas of cleanliness than on the time of all Python users. reply ensignavenger 5 hours agoparentprevDeprecating is not removing.

However unlike many more compiled languages there&#x27;s probably a LOT of python code out there that isn&#x27;t which makes changes to Python and its APIs more risky. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is one of the reasons why the language is popular - it is seen as \"easy and approachable\"; you just write a script and it works for the most part. It also was often the only language built into many distro&#x27;s other than bash making it ultra convenient.Which means a lot of it written isn&#x27;t catalogued, in source control, whatever but still doing stuff people need and often forgotten about. This makes changes of Python IMO more risky.

I would have to maintain lookup tables of when the sleep time, lunch time etc would be for every country as per UTC.Similar problems exist (to a lesser degree) when large countries move to a single timezone.Yes there are flaws in the existing setup, but moving to a single timezone for large countries would only introduce a new set of challenges. reply albert_e 2 hours agorootparentMy comment is being misread as an argument for a single timezone for all of USA.Kindly re-read.I was arguing against daylight savings adjustments twice an year.

For example, maybe your database stores as integer microseconds since an epoch. Fine, but as soon as that leaves the database, ISO-8601 that date. reply theK 17 hours agorootparentI like your premise but disagree with your guidance.You should not convert the integer early, you should actually wait until the very last moment.Nowadays a timestamp will be marshalled and demashalled by (at the very least) two runtimes until it reaches human eyeballs opening up a wide spectrum of bug potential, difficult to understand code and development slowdowns. Keeping it simple and unambiguous is very important. Time libraries have a habit of coming and going, ints are always there and 99% of the date arithmetic is trivial any way.Don&#x27;t use a lib, just pretty print numbers and you&#x27;ll be fine. reply fluoridation 16 hours agorootparentAn int is not unambiguous, though. \"2023-11-19T14:22:34-03:00\" is clearly a timestamp and represents an unambiguous point in time, while a number by itself doesn&#x27;t mean anything. You have to know that it&#x27;s a timestamp (probably from context) and you have to know what timezone it&#x27;s in. reply Izkata 16 hours agorootparentThat datetime is unambiguously represented by 1700414554 as a unix timestamp, and you&#x27;d convert to the user&#x27;s local time zone on display. reply jagged-chisel 15 hours agorootparentBut 1700414554 is not unambiguously a date. Could be a count. Or an identifier. It needs metadata to tell you how to interpret it. For this to represent a datetime, the human needs to know that it’s a datetime, and what epoch and timezone to use. The ISO date string removes the ambiguity because the context for interpreting it is within the string. reply bornfreddy 12 hours agorootparentI never understood this argument. The ISO8601 date string is as much a convention as a unix timestamp is - without context neither are decipherable. If anything, unix timestamp is easier to explain to an alien than a date string. It has a starting point (1970&#x2F;01&#x2F;01 00:00 UTC) and it counts seconds from then. Care to explain how an ISO8601 date string is constructed?Also calculating amount of time between two ISO8601 strings without libraries is nor trivial, or any other operation actually. When dealing with dates, there is only one simple way to work with non-localized times, and it&#x27;s not ISO-something.EDIT:> ...and what epoch and timezone to use.This is also not correct. Unix timestamp has a well defined epoch and it doesn&#x27;t deal with timezones (though the epoch itself is, of course, usually defined as 1970&#x2F;01&#x2F;01 00:00:00 UTC). You are free to define other timestamps, but unix timestamp is well defined. reply tsimionescu 10 hours agorootparentThis is the biggest general problem: you can&#x27;t accurately compare the duration between two date times without having proper context of how the datetimes were stored or generated, especially for future dates. For example, you can&#x27;t say today what the Unix timestamp will be for 1 January 2030, 10:00:00 AM in Bucharest, Romania. Romania may very possibly change timezone by then. So, if a user sets a meeting for that time, converting to the Unix timestamp according to the current timezone info is wrong. You&#x27;ll end up alerting them on 1 January 2030 at 09:00:00 AM, or perhaps 08:59:58 AM if some leap seconds get added. Or it may even be entirely different if there is some calendar change for whatever reason by then.Note that UTC has a similar problem - which is why you actually need a local time string for this type of events. reply theK 4 hours agorootparentCorrect, neither iso strings mor numbers can get you out of this dilema.While ISO uses UTC offset and time zone interchangeably it actually is only defined over offsets, not locations.I&#x27;ve had this problem discussed before. Typically the situation is firing events based on times at specific locations. It is neither straight forward with date libraries nor ist it easy with numeric computation. Sometimes it makes sense to render it down to a specific point in time at storage and not expect the country change timezone overnight. Some times the location itself may be changing randomly (moving objects) but in that case it typically just meant recalculating offsets on movement events. reply mulmen 12 hours agorootparentprevSeconds since epoch requires careful and precise handling of datatypes and assumptions. This works great inside a system where that can be managed but for the purpose of exchange between systems the ISO formats contain all relevant information. Either side can use a library to parse the string into their local representation.Comprehension by extraterrestrial life is a localization problem. reply nerdponx 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure I understand.

But is it true of every implementation? Are you sure?

Prior to that, individual towns were happy with their own local solar time, but once railway connections were introduced, time irregularities would cause chaos at best and carnage at worst. That led to introduction of unified railway time which developed to timezones as we know them.Railways aren&#x27;t as prominent nowadays as they were 100-150 years ago, and countries like Nepal and India don&#x27;t have extensive, frequently used cross-border railways anyway; any cross-border traffic is sporadic and mostly freight.

Including daylight saving time, etc. I agree that any time time goes to a serialized format over a socket or to a database or file it should always be UTC. reply tsimionescu 10 hours agorootparentUTC (or Unix timestamp, or any other non-localized date-time format) doesn&#x27;t work for future localized events. It&#x27;s fundamentally impossible to say what will be the UTC timestamp which corresponds to 9AM in some particular location in the future: the timezone of that location could arbitrarily change between now and then. Countries and smaller areas often experiment with such changes, wars happen and conquerors&#x2F;liberators change the time etc.So, when possible, it&#x27;s best to store (future) human events in a localized datetime string. For things like physical events, the opposite is true of course - you can&#x27;t say what will be the local date and time when the Sun will hit high noon over Athens 10 years from now, but you can certainly calculate the UTC timestamp for that. reply briHass 10 hours agorootparentprevIgnoring holidays&#x2F;weekends: always 9:30AM or (0930) EST.

Or, in the ISO format -4:00 or -5:00 from UTC.I think you meant to put ET (Eastern Time), which is still 9:30AM, but without a date associated with that time, there&#x27;s no way to convert that to UTC or other timezones that don&#x27;t have the same daylight saving time schedule. reply icholy 12 hours agorootparentprevWhy can&#x27;t opening hours be stored in UTC? reply RichieAHB 12 hours agorootparentA store’s opening hours will probably remain 9am-5pm regardless of any time zone changes around it.

Persisting the values in UTC mean best case you are wrong half of the year and worst case all of it. reply capableweb 11 hours agorootparentJust because you&#x27;re storing the time in UTC doesnt mean you can&#x27;t also store the timezone, and lots of other related data too. reply mulmen 11 hours agorootparent6am in my time zone is two different times in UTC. Right now it is 14:00 UTC. But when DST starts it will be 13:00. So what UTC value do you insert into your database for the opening time of the coffee shop? And how do you convert?Yes, you can store additional information to decipher the meaning of a UTC time but why? Storing locale is good because sometimes you need to know where something is, such as when converting the local time to another zone. But you should avoid creating dependencies between these values because it makes using them individually harder.The coffee shop opens at 6am. That is an unambiguous fact. The coffee shop is in Seattle, WA. That is another unambiguous fact.If the time is in UTC then you need to know the date the time was set or store a dtc flag and then build some logic to convert. You can just feed local time+locale into any datetime library and get whatever you need.UTC is great for a lot of things. Such as recording when something happened.

Anywhere it’s used, it’s running in the context of humans. When displaying on a website, you don’t need to do any conversions: the human viewing the store knows where it’s located, and they know the current time, so computers don’t need to answer the question of whether it’s open.If computers do need to know, then they’ll need to know a specific store with a physical location. That gives you the time zone. reply macintux 17 hours agorootparent> If computers do need to know, then they’ll need to know a specific store with a physical location.

It&#x27;s not as bad as mapping address => sales tax (no ZIP Code isn&#x27;t good enough), but only because it doesn&#x27;t change as often and tends to follow county boundaries when it doesn&#x27;t follow state boundaries.Another good example. Arizona doesn&#x27;t follow Daylight Savings, but the Navajo Nation, which includes the Four Corners area and is in three states, does observe the change.However the Hopi reservation, completely surrounded by Navajo territory, is entirely in Arizona, and does not observe DST.

Time Zone names are the right abstraction. A given location very rarely [edit: adopts another] time zone (unless in case of annexations, handovers of territory, etc.), but time zone rules (zone offset from UTC, DST, etc.) change all the time. A consequence of this is that the time zone database of applications should be updated every few months! reply d0mine 13 hours agorootparent\"brittle\" ?Your suggestion to define places by their timezone name is ok (it may work in many cases). reply remram 15 hours agorootparentprev\"9:30 AM every day\" is not a datetime. It&#x27;s a time. reply Footkerchief 17 hours agorootparentprevPostgres stores this as TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE, sometimes called wall-clock time. IMO this is a good convention -- treating \"ideal times\" and specific epoch moments as two different types -- and more languages should support this (ideally with a less confusing label). reply kevindamm 16 hours agorootparentElixir does as well, with NaiveDatetime reply JJMcJ 16 hours agorootparentprevReference opening time to local time on each day of the year, and then refer that back to UTC.Like California is -8 in Standard, -7 in Daylight, so a 9:30 AM opening in the Winter is at 17:30 UTC, in the Summer, 16:30 UTC.It&#x27;s a hassle but programmers are supposed to model reality.As an example of the problems that can arise, I remember when the new Japanese Emperor was to take office upon his father&#x27;s abdication, there was a big fuss because the Era Name was customarily only revealed after the new Emperor&#x27;s reign started but all the computer people wanted to be ready in advance. Not sure what finally happened, if it was revealed in advance or not. reply tsimionescu 10 hours agorootparentWhat if the date for DST changes tomorrow, but only in some locations? How will you know which stores times need to be adjusted and which don&#x27;t?UTC to local time is not a function, it is not somethung that can be computed once and stored for the future. The two are fundamentally different concepts, and can only be related to one another in certain contexts, and only reliably for the past. reply pelorat 17 hours agorootparentprevyou don&#x27;t, since they are different times? reply konschubert 16 hours agorootparentprevstore_opening_hour_and_minute_of_day=(9,0)It’s not a date time. reply dumah 17 hours agorootparentprevTuples of the local time zone (not utc offset) and a time, along with a utc localization conditional on date. reply bofaGuy 17 hours agorootparentprevNot sure if this is a serious question.Each store will have an opening time, each will store the local time that the store opens.. just as utc. reply StableAlkyne 15 hours agoparentprev> I suspect a lot of financial data code is going to break.Reminds me of when Numpy removed a lot of types like np.bool a few releases ago, because they were aliases of the standard library types.Which broke a ton of libraries having Numpy versions pinned to \">=1.0\" or even worse, \"~=1.0\" expecting them to follow the standard practice of incrementing the major version when they break compatibility. It&#x27;s not terrible because you just pin your project to 1.23 or whatever, but it was very annoying when everything I was using just started breaking.I wonder if Python plans to do the same with this - the 2 to 3 transition was painful and dragged on for a decade, nobody wants to do that again for 3 to 4. When they remove this function and break back compatibility with old code, is that going to happen in a future 3.x release? reply hexane360 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worth noting that numpy and scipy have a consistent policy now, although it&#x27;s not semver. Deprecations will always happen at least 2 minor versions before removal:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numpy.org&#x2F;neps&#x2F;nep-0023-backwards-compatibility.htmlhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;numpy.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;stable&#x2F;dev&#x2F;depending_on_numpy.html#run...So, when using numpy in a package, and you&#x27;ve tested e.g. versions 1.12 to 1.22, you should require &#x27;numpy>=1.12,>> utc1 = datetime.timezone.utc >>> utc2 = zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\") >>> utc1 == utc2 False >>> dt1 = datetime.datetime.now(utc1) >>> dt2 = datetime.datetime.now(utc2) >>> dt1.tzinfo == dt2.tzinfo False reply master_crab 15 hours agoparentprevIt definitely will break financial firms. I just did a code search in our repos for utcnow and other relevant functions, and the indexer was definitely wheezing pulling in the hits. reply andrewprock 12 hours agorootparentDeprecation should not break anything. At some point the code will be removed and the org will have to pin the version until the deprecations are resolved. reply maxerickson 18 hours agoparentprevThey aren&#x27;t being removed, they will just toss up a warning. reply tumult 17 hours agorootparentThey will be removed: datetime.datetime’s utcnow() and utcfromtimestamp() are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. reply thaumasiotes 17 hours agorootparentStupid decisions don&#x27;t always get put into practice after they&#x27;re announced.I seem to remember reading that remove-if-not is deprecated in Common Lisp, and that this is almost universally viewed as a mistake, but it remains deprecated (and the deprecation is ignored by everyone) just because the standard doesn&#x27;t change anymore. reply jagged-chisel 17 hours agorootparentprevAren’t now, “will be” in a future version. So the can will be kicked down the road as many generations of devs as needed until no one cares any longer. reply tumult 16 hours agorootparentSo, they remove it in 12 months and your code wasn&#x27;t ready for the change, and people mock you for having not been prepared by updating your code. The Python people have told you to remove it, so nobody will have any sympathy for you if you don&#x27;t do it. As you demonstrated, people are sticklers for quoting exact wording when it comes to criticizing others. reply jagged-chisel 15 hours agorootparentI’m not criticizing. This wording is chosen for this exact reason. Otherwise they would say precisely when they intend to remove it. reply Hamuko 4 hours agorootparentprevHas anything in Python been removed in 12 months? TestCase.assertEquals was deprecated in Python 3.2 (February 2011) and was finally removed in Python 3.12 (October 2023). And that was 12 years for just a simple rename from \"assertEquals\" to \"assertEqual\". reply maxerickson 12 hours agorootparentprevSure, but nothing is going to break from the deprecation.(It&#x27;s going to break from the eventual removal) reply tripflag 17 hours agorootparentprevThe warning is also opt-in; you&#x27;ll have to run python with PYTHONWARNINGS=always or similar to see it.Which is scary, because you will be taking the performance hit from generating the warning regardless, which can easily amount to 30% of your total CPU time if you use utcnow&#x2F;utcfromtimestamp a lot. reply Spivak 18 hours agoparentprevYou still keep everything in UTC in this new world, it&#x27;s just the object you use internally now knows that it&#x27;s UTC and makes it so you can&#x27;t accidentally do calculations on two naive datetimes which happen to be in different timezones.You get to have the typing help you enforce that everything is in UTC. reply konschubert 16 hours agorootparentAnd you have to treat the timezone offset as information-free.As in, 02:00+00:00 and 04:00+02:00 are absolutely equivalent representations of the same data.If you need to know the timezone in which to display a time, you save that timezone separately reply 1letterunixname 3 hours agoparentprevUsing UTC as a universal time standard is stupid because it contains leap-seconds while TAI does not. TAI64* should be the preferred computational monotonic time format. reply lern_too_spel 12 hours agoparentprevThat doesn&#x27;t work for recurring events in local time. reply kstenerud 2 hours agoprevI look at the arguments in this post and see echoes of Y2K:- It&#x27;s a clever hack based on an assumption that dismisses the fact that this assumption can change (that the time zone will never be changed, or that everyone will follow the same rules once it does).- The argument for doing it is: It \"uses less space\" and \"takes less time\"These are similar to the reasons why we used 2-digit years for so long.Timestamps without time zone data are BUGS (and I mean REAL time zones, not time offsets like CET and PST). They are landmines just waiting to go off once the assumptions they&#x27;re based upon change. They require your host system to be configured just-so, making your software brittle. They push the ugly details of handling many time issues that could be handled centrally into the user-space (and even worse, they make it OPTIONAL). The Python maintainers are right to remove this, and really they should have removed naive datetime when they released Python 3.Time is one of the most notoriously difficult things to get right. I&#x27;ve yet to see software using time calculations (or anything more complex than recording timestamps of past events - the only thing for which UTC is useful) that is bug-free.Time data ALWAYS REQUIRES time zone data. The only \"exception\" is timestamps of past events, but only because we always assume them to be UTC (and so there&#x27;s an implied time zone so long as nobody bucks the trend). reply globular-toast 1 hour agoparentNot quite.Local time is very important. \"Tomorrow at 9:00\" is a meaningful local time for everyone, but doesn&#x27;t refer to the same global time. It would be wrong to attach a time zone to such data.Past events, on the other hand, do require timezone data if they are recording human activity, which is basically everything. \"Just use UTC\" is data loss. You now don&#x27;t know whether at event took place at midday or midnight. Two very different results for many activities. reply BugsJustFindMe 18 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t understand why the functions weren&#x27;t just made to return non-naive results. You&#x27;ve literally asked for UTC. There&#x27;s no excuse for allowing the result of that to be interpreted as something that isn&#x27;t UTC.Set a separate flag that governs conversion to string to avoid different ISO output for shitty string parsers if you want, but there&#x27;s no great reason to not just fix the functions so that they continue to work better than before and do the thing that people actually expect them to do, which is produce UTC.Intentionally naive storage or transfer is irrelevant. That&#x27;s just serialization. And when you explicitly tell the computer to \"deserialize this as UTC\" it should fucking do what you told it to and give a zone aware result. reply ak217 7 hours agoparentLet&#x27;s imagine that I have a perfectly reasonable looking piece of code in my app: db.write(Event(timestamp=int(datetime.datetime.utcnow().timestamp()))After the change that you propose, the timestamps written by this code will jump by an amount equal to the offset of the local timezone this machine runs on (and also lose any DST adjustment they might have had).Now, let&#x27;s imagine another independent process is consuming events from the database and compares an event written before this change to one written after.Python is a popular language, used in production by scheduling applications around the world. The potential downside of this kind of change is measured in billions of dollars. The safe solution is of course to not silently change the API in a breaking way, and instead introduce a new API and get someone to look at why the code stopped working. reply wodenokoto 4 hours agorootparentOn my machine, a naive timestamp from utcnow() and a utc timezone aware datetime object from datetime.now(tz=ZoneInfo(&#x27;utc&#x27;)) produces the same timestamp.datetime.now() does not return utc time (but does return a naive datetime object) reply drkevorkian 17 hours agoparentprevThis would be a backwards incompatible change that would cause a lot of issues. For instance, you are not allowed to compare naive and non-naive datetimes, so for instance, `utcnow() > datetime(2023, 11, 19)` would work before, but break following your change. reply akersten 16 hours agorootparentRemoving the functions wholesale isn&#x27;t a backwards incompatible change? reply ollien 16 hours agorootparentIt is one that can be found via static analysis. That may not be true if behavior is changed. In some cases, this may be \"ok\" (see: Go&#x27;s recent loop changes), but in others, it may not. reply IshKebab 13 hours agorootparentMost Python users don&#x27;t do any form of static analysis though, so both changes would only be found at runtime.But I think changing the behaviour and not the name is still a very bad idea. reply kevincox 10 hours agorootparentYes, but \"Unknown function datetime.utcnow\" is much easier to diagnose than somewhere in your application, possibly inside a third-party library or maybe even in a different service altogether (because the change traversed serialization and deserilialization) throwing an exception because you can&#x27;t compare two datetimes. reply ak217 7 hours agorootparentprevBreaking following the change is fine. Silently changing the behavior in a way that could cause catastrophic bugs is not.That&#x27;s why the suggestion to just keep the functions and change their behavior is naive. It would obviously be very unsafe to do so. reply BugsJustFindMe 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s going to break following this change anyway. reply sanderjd 12 hours agorootparentBut in a much more obvious way. Noisy errors are better than quiet inaccuracy.They screwed up these methods from the start, and removing them is the only way to get rid of the confusion, without introducing subtle breakage. reply thrdbndndn 17 hours agoparentprev> I don&#x27;t understand why the functions weren&#x27;t just made to return non-naive results. You&#x27;ve literally asked for UTC.I totally agree with you that it makes no sense this `utcnow()` does not return tz-aware object.But I think their fix is great in this regard: now you just use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. It&#x27;s more explicit, it returns aware DT object now, and more importantly, it gets rid of a function that I always feel too specific to have anyway (like how we don&#x27;t have `plus(a, 2)` and `plustwo(a)`). reply sanderjd 12 hours agorootparentExcept isn&#x27;t datetime.now() still going to return a tz-naive datetime? I would much rather have a method that requires an explicit tz, or explicitly uses UTC (like utcnow, but with the right return type).Looking for this mistake in code reviews gets really old. reply abh123 11 hours agorootparentprevI got bit by this once. Timezones aware date calculations can be an order of magnitude slower than non tz aware. Consider every time a legislative body changes dst, it creates an entry in the timezone database that needs to be checked when adding or subtracting time from that timezone. reply ryukoposting 5 hours agorootparentThis is one of the reasons why Unix epoch time soldiers on, even though it is totally indecipherable to humans. It can be easily mapped to a timezone-aware type, but performing arithmetic on it is trivial. reply InitialBP 17 hours agoparentprevIf this was something used only by your company or a specific project, then I’m absolutely on board. However, this is in a library used in thousands (millions?) of projects. Since it’s potentially a breaking change you can’t just change it and expect everyone to know.Many people won’t know it’s deprecated until the code fails to run, and having new functions rather than changing the functionality of existing functions makes it much easier to identify what is actually happening. reply ak217 7 hours agorootparentCode failing to run is the good outcome. reply raverbashing 1 hour agoparentprevFor real, as much as I&#x27;m annoyed with the change, this is how it should have beenIt is kinda like the 2->3 change with stringsAnd utcnow is a bad name. But the \"fix\" is none the better reply sillysaurusx 18 hours agoprevOne advantage of getting older is that you see a lot of change. In the long run, simple ideas tend to win. And there have been lots of cases where the programming world collectively agreed that some more complex idea was the right way, then a decade later everyone has reverted to the simple idea.UTC is simple and unambiguous. Time is a number representing a fixed point in time. When displaying it for humans, convert it into human form. When this principle is applied everywhere, it’s hard to make mistakes.My gut says that deprecating utc as the native time representation will be one of those ideas fervently embraced by a few, ignored by most, and then quietly forgotten about in a decade. reply ryandrake 17 hours agoparentIt doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re deprecating \"utc as the native time representation.\" They&#x27;re just making it harder to get a datetime object that \"has no time zone.\" The message with this change is: Go ahead and keep using UTC, but explicitly specify it, and the object itself will know it&#x27;s own UTC-ness. reply p5a0u9l 17 hours agoparentprevThey’re not deprecating UTC. Did you read the link? They’re deprecating functions that read as authoritative, but are actually naive about timezones, which can less to non-UTC results. reply sillysaurusx 17 hours agorootparentIf that were true, the recommended fix would be to continue using utc (as numbers). Instead, the recommendation is to use datetime objects.This, I think, is the idea that will be quietly ignored in the long run. reply sanderjd 12 hours agorootparentI think the recommendation is to use a datetime with the timezone explicitly set to utc? I think the numbers vs. objects thing seems like a distraction... reply remram 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat is \"utc as numbers\"? reply worik 15 hours agorootparent> What is \"utc as numbers\"?Seconds since start of epoch reply remram 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re free to use numbers instead of the datetime module. In fact you don&#x27;t have to use any part of the standard library if you don&#x27;t want to. I don&#x27;t understand your remarks at all.If you think UTC means that \"time is a number\" you are very confused though. UTC has no relation with the UNIX timestamps (and the epoch), though they are both ways to represent a specific point in time. reply worik 13 hours agorootparentThe question was: &#x27;What is \"utc as numbers\"?&#x27;You are reading to much into a simple question.> UTC has no relation with the UNIX timestamps (and the epoch),I said nothing about UnixThe epoch in Swift IIRC is in 2000.The idea of counting time in seconds since an epoch is ubiquitous. I am unsure if it is universal reply remram 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m reading too much into my own question? This conversation is getting too inscrutable for me.It was my mistake for trying to engage. Generally people get downvoted for good reason.Still I&#x27;m confused why you&#x27;re in this thread at all, which is about a change to an API you don&#x27;t seem to want to use at all. replyim3w1l 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s hard not to draw the parallel to encodings. Implicit whatever -> Explicit whatever -> Explicit utf8 -> Implicit utf8 reply worik 15 hours agorootparentprev> \"naive about timezones\"That is what they said, but it is inaccurateAll time should be UTC until it is displayedSo a number without a timezone is seconds since epoch in UTCThat is \"default\" not naiveSome Python applications programmers made stupid mistakes so they change the libraryGolly. On the face of it Python is a mess. And it is everywhere. Golly reply int_19h 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re focusing on representation where you should be thinking about semantics.A \"naive\" datetime is the one for which it is not known what the timezone is. The opposite is the one for which it is known. You can absolutely encode UTC timezones as seconds since epoch without any additional information (except that one bit that is needed to distinguish them from \"naive\" ones, which doesn&#x27;t have to be a literal bit - it can be just a different data type, for example).And, yes, it would sure be nice if we didn&#x27;t have \"naive\" datet",

Download or just view the media Zero-K v1.11.11.1 - Odin's Magpies This update introduces two new bombers to fill out the aircraft roster. One is a bit like a light Likho, and another is like a heavy Raven, but there is a lot more to each. Other planes have tweaks and buffs, such as an area reveal ability for Sparrow, and a heavier Phoenix. Some gunships even got in on the action, with the most notable being a sizeable buff for Krow. Other balance changes include a bit more health for light assaults, and better spinning for Disco Rave Party. In terms of features, bombers are well-served here as well, with selection icons for whether a bomber needs ammo, as well as smoother landing paths. There are a few extra features for modding, such as scaling and tinting, which were technically in the previous hotfix. The campaign has the new bombers, a few features, and a new Records page which displays and aggregates your best stats for each mission. How fast can the campaign be completed, and with how few units lost? New Bombers Magpie is a light nimble bomber armed with a pair of missiles. It deals less damage than Raven, but makes up for it with speed, precision, and the ability to shoot from the edge of AA coverage. Cost 220 Health 900 Speed 252 (between Raven and Likho) Rearm time 20s Range 550 Damage 180 x 2 Can hit small raiders most of the time, and most aircraft. Odin is a heavily armoured rocket zeppelin that can fire a slow moving disintegrator bomb or a cluster of temporary shields. Cost 1500 Health 5200 Speed 185 (between Raptor and most gunships) Rearm time 35s Bomb range 200 Bomb damage, it's a disintegrator (5-shots Detriment) The bomb is very slow, even Detriment can dodge it. Special weapon fires seven shields at 550 range. Each shield has 3400 charge and a radius of 200. Shields decay at 40 charge/s, expire at zero charge, and do not link. Aircraft Changes Sparrow can now boost, and reveals and decloaks everything in an area when it dies. Boosts by 5x for 3 seconds. Destroys itself after boost. Reveals an area of radius 400 for 12 seconds when it dies. Revealed area scales up during boost, to a maximum of 640. Phoenix is heavier and deals more damage over a longer run. Cost 360 -> 460 Health 1060 -> 1450 (90 more than if just scaling by cost) Reduced turn rate slightly Rearm time 5s -> 8s Drops 15 -> 18 bombs over 0.93 -> 1.7 seconds Area of Effect 216 -> 320 Damage per bomb 25 -> 40 Burn time 10s -> 12s Krow manoeuvrers a bit better and fires beam lasers with more damage. Improved brake rate by 25%. Pew pew lasers replaced with burst beam lasers. Damage increased by 22% Raptor is more manoeuvrable and slightly more deadly. Increased turn rate while firing, to counteract the effect of slowing down. Firing cone angle 90 degrees -> 100 degrees Damage increased by 4.2% Locust is a tiny bit better as raiding, as a great Locust is scary. Speed 207 -> 212 DPS increased by 2.5% Thunderbird is slightly healthier. Health 1120 -> 1200 Balance Changes Bolas has 4.5% more DPS and can 1-shot Flea. Reload 0.366 -> 0.433 Damage 34 -> 42 Ravager is tankier. Health 2000 -> 2200 Knight is a bit tankier. Health 2400 -> 2500 Hermit is tankier and faster. Health 1500 -> 1550 Speed 51 -> 54 Skuttle can survive a single Jack poke. Health 250 -> 380 Zephyr is also tankier, and now has missiles. Health 1900 -> 2200 Replaced its front laser turret with missiles. Missile damage 72 x 2 Reload time 1.6 seconds Range 1000 (same as lasers) The missiles have 30% less DPS, but fire in a burst. Disco Rave Party has an interpolation of its May spin rate nerfs. Aim speed 4 -> 2.5 -> 3 degrees/s. Spin up time 60 -> 120 -> 90 seconds. Spin drop while turning is unchanged, but less spin is lost for any given turn due to the increased turn rate. Campaign Magpie is unlocked on Fel Diacia (the Thunderbird mission) and Odin is unlocked on Bavhakya (the Likho mission). Anyone with these missions complete will have their units unlocked. Added a Records tab to the Profile menu on the campaign screen. This screen can sort and display your victories with least units lost, in the shortest time, with bonus objectives and difficulties. Unfortunately the data is not retroactive. Removed a few Lucifers from easier difficulties on Onsally (the Phoenix mission). Worked around the Dominatrix build options bug for the Rover Assembly on Ganong (the Dominatrix mission). Clarified Lalata main objective text (the Jugglenaut mission). Features Added Units Lost to endgame graphs. Unit pictures for bombers now have an icon showing whether it is ready to fire. Aircraft now smoothly glide and stop when landing on airpads. This is technically a nerf as they take slightly longer to land. Improved shotgun visuals, with minor balance implications. Grizzly now aims smoothly and holds its gun steady as it fires. Tweaked the automatic handicap mode to give lower handicaps for ratings above 2000. Moved Raptor to the AA slot (D) of the Airplane Plant and Sparrow to secondary scout/raider (S). Taught the opponent AI about Magpie. Modding Units can now be tinted, rescaled and made glowing via the customparams model_tint (\"R G B\"), model_glow (\"R G B A\"), and model_rescale. Colour values are from 0 to 1. Free units (0 metal and energy cost) no longer need to explicitly specify a non-zero buildtime (previous release). Added a function to effects/napalm for generating generic fireballs ala Inferno. Air pads now call ReammoComplete, if it is a units script, when bombers are rearmed. Added command AIR_MANUALFIRE for aircraft, since they cannot use the in-engine type. Fixes Fixed Tremor wheels not spinning. Gravity guns push and pull a bit more consistently. Jack can no longer pretend to be a missile in enemy Missile Silos. Slow damage makes shields charge slower again (it broke at some point) Fixed bombers sometimes seeming to ignore a move command. Attack Move on bombers is now is now removed after they shoot, unless the bomber is set to repeat. Previously this only worked for some bombers. Bombers are now much better at landing on Reef. Much better. Horrific things could happen before. Fix sun on Mercurial and Rogues River. Posted by GoogleFrog 2 days ago - comment Zero-K v1.11.10.0 This is a hotfix release for an engine bug that could be used to place geos anywhere. Modding Units can now be tinted, rescaled and made glowing via customparams: model_tint = \"1.0 0.5 0.0\" -- R G B model_glow = \"0.1 0.2 0.3 1.0\" -- R G B A model_rescale = 1.23, Free units (0 metal and energy cost) no longer need to explicitly specify a non-zero buildtime. Support some recently added engine interfaces, see `engine_compat.lua`. Note that ZK hasn't yet migrated. Fixes Fix an exploit to do with geo placement. Fix the \"Enable Force Fire Command\" default state for Lobster. Fix Dominatrix breaking when capturing very low completion nanoframes of very expensive units. Fix awards for sharing and capture to consider nanoframes at their real value. Fix a chat crash if using the \"color labels the player colour\" option. Fix Onyx Cauldron using incorrect boxes in coop comp stomps. Fix cloaked constructors revealing themselves by reclaiming if using the automated constructors widget. Land units now eventually give up when ordered to move deep into an inaccessible place (such as a large sea). Posted by GoogleFrog 33 days ago - comment Zero-K v1.11.8.1 - Lobster Brained Lobsters have been taught to not fire when it would be redundant, making Lobster balls much easier to manage. Overkill prevention in general has a tweak, and some APIs were extended to make modding easier. The Artefact Control game mode which saw some testing about a month ago is now live. In terms of balance, Redback has a bit of a nerf and some of the least used units - Skuttle, Phoenix and Emissary - have small buffs. Balance Duck can now be dodged by a Glaive trying as hard as it can to run away. Missile fuel time 2s -> 1.5s Redback is worse at taking map control and assaulting defenses. Cost 230 -> 240 Speed 1.85 -> 1.75 Skuttle can see enemies before they break its cloak. Line of sight 280 -> 330 Emissary aims faster and no longer benefits from manually turning. Body turn rate reduced 105 -> 84 degrees/second Gun aim rate increased 40 -> 70 degrees/second Resets its gun between shots (as much as possible) in case it has to move. Phoenix moves faster and hits its target sooner. Speed 8 -> 8.1 Projectile gravity 0.7 -> 0.72 Unit AI Overkill prevention, the system that prevents ten Scalpels firing at a single Glaive, is now available for Lobster and disabled for units set to hold. It is controlled by a state toggle that is hidden by default because there is very little reason to touch it. The state toggle can be enabled under Settings/Interface/Commands, and per-unit defaults to be set in Settings/Unit Behaviour/Default States, or by holding Space and clicking on a unit, then pressing Edit Behaviour. Lobster is smarter, no longer firing unless there is a visible valid target. This prevents it from firing when it would do absolutely nothing, provided there are no invisible enemies nearby. As a result, telling a tight clump of Lobsters to fire causes only two to shoot. This behaviour can be configured with the hidden Overkill Prevention state. Removed the Force Fire command by default. This can be configured via another hidden state toggle. Overkill prevention is now suspended by default when units are set to Hold Fire. Added the \"Enable for Fire at Will\" and \"Enable for auto targeting\" states. Previously it just had enabled/disabled. Most units default to \"Enable for Fire at Will\". The theory being that if you set a unit to hold fire you care more about its target dying than about overkill. Nothing defaults to \"Enable for auto targeting\", but it may be useful to try out. Impaler now has an even stronger preference for targeting structures over units. Interface Added a minimum wind icon and number to the left column of the wind generator tooltip during placement (thanks Porkchop) Cleaned up some inconsistent unit highlighting and selection. Units under interface panels cannot be clicked on by default, tooltips do not appear, and units are not highlighted. Selecting through the panel at the bottom of the screen can be configured under Settings/HUD Panels/Selected Units Panel. Drag selection can still terminate over a UI panel. Add some translations for the commander selector. Updated Global Build AI with some fixes and documentation (thanks esainane). Added username team colour in chat and removed white outlines for dark names (thanks Birdulon) Local widgets are no longer disabled for spectators on rooms with local widgets disabled. Added Italian translations for the main menu (thanks fvasco) Campaign Tweaked campaign text and replaced some Artefacts with more suitable structures (thanks Thorneel) Maps Added boxes for Onyx Cauldron 2.0 Improved lighting on Skulduggery (thanks Shaman) Improved water on Cull, Lost v2 and Lowland Crossing Revised v2. Fixed an issue with void water with new shaders on some graphics cards. Artefact Control Added a control point game mode called Artefact Control under Experimental. Several artefacts are spawned on each side of the map. Each team controls half at the start of the game. Artefacts have 11k health and heal at 100 hp/second. Artefacts respawned with switched allegeance when destroyed. If a team controlls all the artefacts, they win. Modding Changed some keys in unit def files to match the lua UnitDefs table. Mods with the old keys are still supported. buildCostMetal -> metalCost buildCostEnergy -> energyCost energyUse -> energyUpkeep metalUse -> metalUpkeep (vanilla ZK doesn't use this) maxDamage -> health maxVelocity -> speed Other changes. Unit defs no longer require unitname since it must match the table key, so it is redundant. Unit defs are now also read from subfolders of 'units'. Set undefined burst rates to 0 (rather than 0.1) as it can interfere with weapon modding. The game exits to menu when unit defs fail to load, rather than crashing. Added game-side GG.UnitModelRescale(unitID, scale) from Unit Level Ups. Added backwards compatibility for Spring.GetUnitIsBeingBuilt. Fixed backwards compatibility for Spring.GetPlayerRulesParams. Added customparams.buggeroff_angle for factories, in radians. Added customparams.metal_extractor_mult to support the creation of higher tier metal extractors. Fixed modding away the Sniper reload move penalty breaking the script. Cleaned up the build icon generator gadget. Napalm effects now contain an example of sin (replaces taylor series). Improved modded energy generator tooltips. Mexes suport morphing. Fixes Fixed commshare sometimes preventing resign or causing a crash when the game ends. War music no longer counts morph as violence. Fixed missing vote resign button. Marginal turret overshoot can no longer be circumvented with command insert. Fixed a few build icons incorrectly implying that a floating structure is built underwater. Fixed commander selector button image. Fixed backwards 'motion blur' on ejected shells. Fixed some large structure wreckages having much too large collision volumes. Posted by GoogleFrog 2 months ago - comment Zero-K v1.11.6.5 - Sudden Death This is mostly a small fixes update for the previous patch. It has a few balance chanegs and features though. Most notable are a slight Redback nerf and a sudden death mode. The sudden death mode might see use in the upcoming tournament to put a cap on very long games, but we are still waiting to see what people think of it. In any case, it seems like a useful mode to have. Balance Redback is worse at dodging projectiles. Increased collision shape width by 11% and length by 25%. Reduced turn rate by 5%. Ogre now ignores terrain and wrecks when aiming and firing. It has sufficient AoE and arc for making the attempt to often be beneficial. Zeno now homes onto the actual position of a radar target earlier - early enough to hit it. Features Holding Alt while selecting units now filters out rank 3 (ie army units). Added a sudden death mode game option, under Map. It causes the game to end shortly after a specified time via a contracting death circle. Fixes Fixed a missile impact indicator error. Fixed a pathfinding issue to do with construction orders on terrible terrain. Tactical missiles no longer have inconsistent half-prediction of enemy velocity. They now fire exactly where they are aimed. Fixed contrast adaptive sharpening scaling with zoom level. Fixed moderator tooltip colour in the lobby. Improved Pylon collision and selection volumes.

You had to animate them with a C-like language, and I was trying to teach myself C at the time so that was part of my programming journey.The &#x27;Swedish Yankspankers&#x27; were a clan that had a channel on the IRC server, and my recollection, which may be wrong, is that they started building an app, &#x27;TAreplay&#x27; that we could use to record and rewatch tournament games. People used to pass the exe around - not very secure, but those were the times!It&#x27;s amazing to me that those players hacking little apps together for themselves, have spawned a lineage of RTS engines and games that are still going all this time later.A small but incredible example of hacker culture. reply russnewcomer 16 hours agoparentIt’s still some of the same folks - SJ and some of the other SYs wrote the Spring Engine that Zero-K uses.I myself learned how to code writing .bos scripts and hanging out at Annihilated, TAU, and #gnugIf you want to see some of the stuff still possible and being done in the TA engine, check out TAUniverse.com reply jhoho 11 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;ll love what the community did with Supreme Commander, Chris Taylor&#x27;s spiritual successor to Total Annihilation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faforever.com&#x2F;They even created a Coop-Campaign and a completely new faction. reply willis936 11 hours agorootparentI put a lot of hours into SupCom. It was always a buggy mess, but I do remember it quite fondly. Planetary Annihilation has felt like the right progression in the spiritual series. It was always a very smooth experience and fixed the technical issues with scaling up to massive scale combat while fixing the balance issues of turtling. The skill ceiling is immense and I could never beat high level bots. The nature of having one to many planets also means you can play cooperatively with up to several friends.

Planetary Annihilation was a heroic effort lead by Jonathan Mavor (formerly of Gas Powered Games) that fused elements of TA, SC, and its own crazy ideas on what amounted to a shoestring budget.Supreme Commander&#x27;s budget was about $50M USD (circa the mid-2000s), and Mavor was lead engineer on the project.Beyond All Reason is arguably more similar to Total Annihilation than Planetary Annihilation.By that same token, Sanctuary is the closest thing to a complete remake of Supreme Commander. Granted, Forged Alliance Forever has had such incredible work put in by the community that it comes close, but it&#x27;s ultimately stuck on the same engine.Turns out Mavor has a new company now, and I&#x27;m elated to hear someone&#x27;s finally combining Factorio with a decent RTS component:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;industrialannihilation.com&#x2F; replyewy1 21 hours agoprevSo happy to see this here! I used to play this a lot with my boyfriend - we were pretty evenly matched, and the game allowed for so much freedom which made every game wild. The most impressive feature is - in my opinion - the wide variety of commands you can provide to your units and how their AI interacts with them. For example, if you build a crowd of fast and agile grunts and make them match speed with a slower tank, they will still avoid enemy projectiles with their superior speed. reply fho 17 hours agoparentOne of the features I used the most was the \"distributed move&#x2F;fight\" command.

It&#x27;s a lot of similar units (e.g. tanks) with subtle variations, multiple tiers, with a focus on out-numbering your opponent.Zero-K went a different route. They simplified the economy (metal cost = energy cost) but added a whole lot of mechanics like overdrive grids and made every unit unique. There is a lot of variety with mind-control, jumpjets, shields, unit-throwers, self-replicators, teleports, terraforming, etc.Zero-K has been on Steam for a few years, I think BAR is working towards it. They are both good worthwhile games, they share some common elements, but they are both worth trying in their own right. reply liotier 13 hours agorootparent> unit-throwersWas the BAR peewee-launching gun inspired by Zero-K ? reply 3seashells 3 hours agorootparentZero k used terraform Ed ramps and newton&#x27;s? reply Buttons840 17 hours agoparentprevTo compare the two:Zero-K allows 16 vs 16 battles (and it works!), each player controls a relatively smaller number of units. In Beyond All Reason, there are 8 v 8 battles and each player controls a larger number of units, maybe 200 or so at the peak of battle. (There are some strong, but predictable AIs for both games.)Zero-K has more units that are less realistic and have more variety. BAR has more realistic units and less variety. BAR has tanks, Zero-K has flying tanks that can also turn invisible (this is a made up example, but illustrates the idea).Zero-K has a limited economy, you have to control land to to generate income, and fighting has more influence on who wins. In BAR, the economy is more exponential, and at high tech levels controlling land doesn&#x27;t matter, you can generate a huge income in a tiny corner of the map and win because your economy is exponentially stronger than anything your opponents have. reply astrobe_ 15 hours agorootparentTo clarify, ZK doesn&#x27;t population caps like e.g. Starcraft. The actual limit is actually the CPU&#x2F;GPU (and maybe your bandwidth too). ZK&#x27;s 16vs16 host, the \"lobster pot\" as they call it, can barely be playable if your rig is too weak. reply rollcat 11 hours agorootparent> ZK doesn&#x27;t population capsThat sounds like poor RTS design.Popcap is one of the simplest and most effective \"anti-snowballing\" mechanisms. Once you&#x27;re \"maxed out\", you cannot get further ahead - you must attack and trade to build new stuff. If you can just keep making stuff without ever being forced to trade, whoever gets ahead first, eventually wins.Supply also serves as a comeback mechanic - you were even, but took one bad fight, so you can immediately spend all your money to get a new army. Meanwhile your opponent must construct additional pylons before they can get much further ahead - they grow stronger slower than you regrow the lost limbs. reply GoogleFrog 1 hour agorootparentPopcap is just one of the ways to design an RTS, there are others.Zero-K solves the problems solved by popcap in other ways. Income tracks map control, and controlling more of the map is hard, so players that are ahead don&#x27;t have the freedom to sit back and build up an overwhelming army. Armies are fighting or jockeying for position throughout the game and army size and composition keeps escalating. Defenders advantage shifts to attackers advantage as things escalate, so people can&#x27;t just sit in their base. The overall effect is that, while there is a pop cap at the technical level, it is 10x higher than the unit counts that even the largest battles tend to equilibrate to.Talking about the lack of popcap is a bit backwards in a way. There are just so many subtle things that mean the question of popcap never has to come up. Maps are pretty open, units don&#x27;t fire through each other, AoE exists... the list goes on. A better question might be why games with a popcap couldn&#x27;t be designed away from the failure mode of people sitting in their base making larger and larger armies. Having to put a hard cap on army sizes, that people regularly reach, is sort of a drastic measure.On supply, I&#x27;d say what you said about supply is pretty important. But the aspect of it you bring up isn&#x27;t limited to popcap. Eg C&C games have power plants that act as construction supply. Rebuilding your base is easier the second time around, as long as you keep your power plants. There is something similar in Zero-K with energy. Metal comes from points around the map while energy can be built in your base, and both resources are used for construction. When you take more metal spots you also need more energy, and the energy is nowhere near as vulnerable. That is the main supply-like comeback mechanic, which works since part of your economy is always vulnerable. Reclaiming wrecks for metal is another comeback mechanic. reply Buttons840 10 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of truth to what you&#x27;re saying, but it&#x27;s interesting to solve that problem other ways. For example, a high tech unit that can kill hundreds of spam units, or just making more expensive units more economical and better to build than endless spam.That said, BAR is trying to balance the game to reduce spam currently. Having an endless stream of trash units charging ahead is great for scouting, even if they don&#x27;t do much damage. reply pdntspa 10 hours agorootparentprevScrew that, everyone is afraid of 1000 vs 1000 unit battles. This is what I want!Total Annihilation and its ilk balance that by having the commander unit, which is game-over if lost. There are a lot of really underhanded tactics one can employ to sneak a win here. (My favorite is picking up the enemy commander with a transport and then scuttling the transport...) Plus the large army size means the player likely has exploitable gaps in their defenses as their attention is split so many more ways. reply rollcat 10 hours agorootparentOh well I guess that depends on the win condition, and yes I can imagine 1000v1000 units can be fun (myself am an avid enjoyer of 4v4 in SC2). But especially as the number of players go up, I think the popcap should be going down. I&#x27;ve played a couple custom 2v2 games in SC2 with a reduced popcap (100 instead of 200) and the games were wiiiiiiiild: you have very little economy and turtling is just impossible, so the games end up being constant and insane back&forth to claw an advantage.I guess what I really don&#x27;t like in RTSs is turtling. If I wanted to play SimCity, I&#x27;d be playing SimCity. reply pdntspa 10 hours agorootparentI love turtling. I hate that the prevailing strategy seems to be always be on the offense and micro eighty million stupid little things. esports and APS have ruined competitive RTS play.Turtling lets me build up my base and economy and nurture a curbstomping offense after which I can overwhelm my opponents. If I wanted to play a tactical RTS there are a million options out there that limit you with horse-blinders reply Buttons840 9 hours agorootparentSo your preferred balance is that both players build and nurture a base until one goes an overwhelms and \"curbstomps\" the other? That doesn&#x27;t sound satisfying. Remember, 50% of the time you need to be the one getting curbstomped. Just imagine that base you nurtured getting rolled over and there&#x27;s not much you can do; is that fun?It&#x27;s easy to be too optimistic when balancing a game. It&#x27;s easy to imagine \"oh, this unit will be nearly indestructible, and I can watch it destroy my opponents and their bases\". But what really happens is \"my opponent destroyed me, I tried everything I could but his unit was nearly indestructible\".(This is why we need strong AI for RTS games. First, we get strong AI, then we find ways of dumbing it down in fun ways.

And a lower population cap would make it easier to turtle, not harder, so I&#x27;m kind of confused as to how it worked in your example ?\"Playing Sim City\" is a common insult thrown at team mates BTW in TA-derived games (too). reply rollcat 8 hours agorootparent> Not sure why you would expect that turtling (porc(upine)ing) would work in a competitive game with 2 teams, the opponnents will just take the rest of the map and then crush you using these extra resources.That&#x27;s exactly the issue, when playing in a random team. Matchmaking can be a real dice roll in a small playerbase (which SC2 4v4 is). Sometimes I get teammates 500MMR below me, where the metagame is almost always turtling to T3 behind infinite static defense.Being the only aggressive player in a game with 7 turtles feels extremely unrewarding. Sure I can go expand first into 80+ workers before making a single army unit. I just think games like this suck.Even if you execute your initial greed correctly, you&#x27;re still vulnerable because they&#x27;ve been building T3 units, you have more places to defend, and a bigger part of your popcap is taken by the workers. Maybe it would actually be good here if SC2 didn&#x27;t have a popcap (so that you continue to capitalize on your initial greed for the rest of the game), but that would make Zerg incredibly broken - they make more stuff (including workers) faster than any other faction.> And a lower population cap would make it easier to turtle, not harder, so I&#x27;m kind of confused as to how it worked in your example ?Lower popcap means you don&#x27;t get to continue building an even bigger, more unbeatable army behind a wall of turrets or cannons. Static defense doesn&#x27;t really help against armies (only deters harassment), because siege weapons. Sitting on a maxed army is throwing away a temporary advantage. It incentivizes to attack first, because even if the opponent is maxed too, any time you take an even fight near an enemy base, you get to deal a little bit of damage to their eco or production (the win condition is to destroy all enemy structures).SC2 recently rotated the entire team map pool; many maps now have very few bases and a very short rush distance. Some people still try to turtle, but it&#x27;s difficult as attacking early is so much stronger. The average quality of the games has IMHO gone way up. reply BlueTemplar 10 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t really seen it to be an issue in TA-derived games.I guess because economy still requires territory control, and a bigger territory is harder to defend ?Also it&#x27;s probably not a coincidence that these games have a lot of units dealing area damage, and most importantly, units cannot shoot through each other, and when they try it can often end in friendly fire, which makes snowballing weaker ?Anyway, desperate situations where the underdog eventually manages to turn the tide are not uncommon.

Of course, balance is different, but TA balance was very odd.ZeroK seems to have terrain modification mechanics which is not present in TA.In BAR terrain can be damaged by big explosions, but it&#x27;s very limited.FWIW I never played ZeroK but based on their intro video BAR seems to be closer to TA visually. reply BlueTemplar 21 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty much the inverse : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero-k.info&#x2F;Forum&#x2F;Thread&#x2F;29067BAR used to stand for \"Balanced Annihilation Reloaded\" - so it&#x27;s sticking very close to TA, while Zero-K has been experimenting much more freely with what is possible in the Spring&#x2F;Recoil engine.It&#x27;s also probably a factor that BAR has spent a decade in development hell (under a different team than now ?), so it just didn&#x27;t have the velocity to fork away sufficiently, even if it wanted to. reply DayDollar 20 hours agorootparentEh, no? Zero-k was there first, and gathered vital info. The original setup for spring rollout of games was thoroughly inadequat to supporting large number of gamers. Fuck, the first lobby server wrote match infos into a freaking textfile.The first indicator of that popped up, when valve ended greenlight, and just greenlit all the things. Which propped Evolution RTS upon the steam front page for half a day, flooding the original lobby system and showing how inadequat the whole ecosystem was for that. The original Evo dev Forb learned from the whole mess after he returned from his day job.Zero-k then learned the lessons, developed a ingui lobby, started the whole matchmaking and better server deployment, detached from the whole \"one central server\" thing of the spring eco system.BAR did some graphical overhaul, with Floris, Beherith, Sprung and the whole original crew supported by new faces like Teifion and on and on.

It&#x27;s being developed by the ex-Blizzard team that worked on SC2 and WC3. More big names involved than I care to drop. , ZeroSpace came out of the blue a couple months ago with pre-alpha gameplay videos, kickstarter, tournaments, etc. They have several SC2 pros and community figures involved in development (Scarlett, CatZ, PiG, GiantGrant, Maguro). Their kickstarter just raised over half a million dollars. , .There&#x27;s also Immortal, which has been in development for a longer while. The team has previously built some great SC2 mods, and the pre-alpha got some attention from SC2 pros. The big \"problem\" with RTS is that the genre in general is not very accessible. SC1 is clunky (1998), SC2 is extremely lethal (splash damage vs glass cannons), team modes like 2v2 are not considered seriously (people want to play with their friends), getting good at the game requires learning all the rock-paper-scissors of dozens of units per faction that make Pokemon type charts pale in comparison. The 1v1 ladder is designed to give you an average 50% winrate, hence it demands that you consistently play at your best or deal emotionally with a giant lose streak.The team making Stormgate is aware of these (and many other) problems, and takes a lot of input from the community on Reddit. It&#x27;s gonna boil down to execution, but I have faith that they can make a fun game that&#x27;s gonna be appealing to a much broader crowd than the hardcore RTS fans. reply wheelerof4te 13 hours agoparentprevStormgate is one of the recent promising titles. reply brucethemoose2 15 hours agoparentprevThe Planetary Annihilation devs are coming out with a factory-rts hybrid game akin to Mindustry.That seems the direction RTS is heading in general, hybridizing with other genres. reply olavgg 11 hours agorootparentlink? reply willis936 11 hours agorootparentI want them to take my money.Update: They have taken my money.

Is there micro? Or is it more sc2 style where you put all your units in a single control group and then death ball them into the other death ball? reply Pannoniae 16 hours agoparentThe game is much less click-intensive, but you need really good situational awareness for it. It doesn&#x27;t have \"traditional\" micro, you don&#x27;t need to manually queue units or babysit every single unit so it doesn&#x27;t die immediately, but to win, you need to micro in key areas and most importantly, manage your economy well. reply thinkingtoilet 14 hours agorootparentInteresting. Does managing your economy mean being efficient and keeping resources low or are there more complex elements to it? reply MauranKilom 9 hours agorootparentSome basics (from someone who played the game a bunch a decade ago): There are two resources, metal and energy, neither can \"mine out\". To build something, you need equal amounts of both, and the thing building can only spend them at a certain rate (\"buildpower\"). Notably, metal income is effectively proportional to the amount of territory you control, whereas energy generation can be built anywhere. Buildpower is local to factories and builder units. Neither resource needs to be \"moved around\", it can be spent by builders anywhere.One important economy management aspect is matching your metal income with at least as much energy income and buildpower so you can actually spend it (excess energy is turned into a bit of extra metal). And then yes, you should spend it, but the factories support queues (including automatic re-queueing), and you can of course shift-queue buildings.Another important aspect is that dead units leave behind metal scraps. This can boost your metal income substantially (e.g. if a failed enemy attack leads to a bunch of dead units near your base).In short, balancing metal income (&#x2F;territory expansion) with energy income and buildpower is the core economy management loop. But because units have pretty capable AI (e.g. auto-kite when applicable), you can devote a lot more of your attention to this aspect, as well as higher-level decision making. reply thinkingtoilet 7 hours agorootparentThank you so much for the detailed response. Seems interesting. reply chaps 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause ZK doesn&#x27;t have an exponential economy, each unit is important, even the cheap ones.

(At which point my own PC with a GeForce 4 which, for comparison to today, had either 0.064 or 0.128 Go of VRAM, would struggle to run it.) Some graphic improvements have happened since then of course, and the requirements are now somewhat higher.Now the issue is that it doesn&#x27;t have the unit caps that SC2 does, and the number of players (now up to 16vs16 in a normal game, sometimes even 32vs32, while in 2009 8vs8 would have been the max), map sizes, and number of units (typically up to ~0.5k in 2006 compared to topping up at ~5k-10k today) only kept growing.So if you want to play big team games, and have a much worse CPU than the average player, you might not have the best time in the endgame. reply wheelerof4te 17 hours agorootparentAre there any popular 4vs4 games?I will first start versus AI, then take it from there.

I&#x27;ve played most (but not all) of them, and provided personal recommendations alongside the reviews. Many of them are also playable on GeForce Now (if you don&#x27;t have a gaming PC).Please contribute if you know of more, or have any comments&#x2F;suggestions!",

It was originally built as an elevator simulation and then turned into a game, and it shows. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a 16 bit application and thus not well suited for modern systems. It was unstable even back then, time was tied to CPU speed, and playing with DosBox and corresponding bad mouse behavior (no acceleration) isn&#x27;t fun.Project Highrise seems to mostly omit the fine-grained elevator control that was at the core of Sim Tower, so the most recent successor that I&#x27;m aware of is Yoot Tower, which I didn&#x27;t get around to trying yet.

Or tower defense&#x2F;RTS games (like Mindustry) or simulation (like Rimworld) where you could automate the AI.I see some games involving coding, but mostly look like hacking games, which I think are more puzzle games, vs. sandbox.Like I said, Autonauts would have been this, but it’s just too awkward, and not quite as deep as I was hoping.I was excited this was such a list, until I realized it wasn’t software engineering.(My very first experience with something close to this was FFXII, which I loved, but fell flat for many because they didn’t want to automate the battles, which was my favorite part!)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;979120&#x2F;Autonauts&#x2F; reply alex-mohr 11 hours agoparentLook at Screeps: World [0] for depth in a programming base-builder RTS.You write the code for each of your units, either natively in Javascript or Typescript, or via WASM you can run Rust, Python, etc. You use a private server or join a shared MMO world. There&#x27;s a free sim [1] to try out the basics, though the actual game has much more depth. And an active Discord for help [2].There&#x27;s also a variant Screeps: Arena [3] that focuses on 1:1 PVP battles with ranked ladders if you prefer short-lived matches to a long-running world.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;464350&#x2F;Screeps_World&#x2F;[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screeps.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;#!&#x2F;sim[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;invite&#x2F;RjSS5fQuFx[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1137320&#x2F;Screeps_Arena&#x2F; reply jader201 11 hours agorootparentI knew about this one, but was turned off by the review talking about the base CPU isn&#x27;t enough, requiring a subscription. reply alex-mohr 9 hours agorootparentI get that, but IMO it&#x27;s not an issue.On one shard you can&#x27;t use more than base CPU, so there&#x27;s no advantage to a subscription there.Other optional shards are almost entirely people who subscribe. Do that too if you decide to, or ignore them. reply idoubtit 2 hours agoparentprevBitburner is in the list, and it&#x27;s an excellent game where you have to code (JS&#x2F;Typescript). The date 2021 is wrong like many others in the page: it&#x27;s probably the introduction on Stream, because the game goes back to 2016. It&#x27;s an open-source game (reading the source code is sometimes recommended) and can be played in the browser at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitburner-official.github.io&#x2F;It&#x27;s a long and rather hard game, but I liked its learning curve. You&#x27;ll need to understand the way the \"world of the game\" works, then define and code a strategy. Then other \"worlds\" appear, where other strategies are required.

Yes, that&#x27;s what Steam says, and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s 1.0 release date. But Satisfactory is listed as 2020, and that is still in early access. So maybe note on the list when a game is still in early access? reply jader201 6 hours agoparentWhat does “early access” even mean nowadays? Seems like devs can label (or not label) a game as “early access” whenever they want. I’m guessing most do it as a way to set lower expectations to minimize bad reviews.I think Factorio was early access longer than necessary, and Satisfactory also feels like it’s well beyond “early access”.E.g. it’s not like “early access” means that they’re still making changes to the game, and stop making changes once the label is gone. I’ve seen “early access” games get abandoned (or even never see another update), and I’ve seen games out of “early access” still continue getting several updates. reply handoflixue 5 hours agorootparentSatisfactory feels like it&#x27;s absolutely Early Access: Recent Satisfactory patches have changed the tech tree, broken existing production lines due to recipe changes, and even changed the geography of the world (one of my power plants is now inside a mountain, which makes it very difficult to change anything). They&#x27;re also planning to add a plot involving the alien artifacts you find across the world, although so far nothing further is known.That seems to be the clear line between \"early access\" and \"Updates past 1.0\": are you backwards compatible?

Last month, I shared an article with several LoRA experiments, based on the open-source Lit-GPT repository that I co-maintain with my colleagues at Lightning AI. This Ahead of AI article aims to discuss the primary lessons I derived from my experiments. Additionally, I'll address some of the frequently asked questions related to the topic. If you are interested in finetuning custom LLMs, I hope these insights will save you some time in \"the long run\" (no pun intended). In brief, the main takeaways I am discussing in this article are the following: Despite the inherent randomness of LLM training (or when training models on GPUs in general), the outcomes remain remarkably consistent across multiple runs. QLoRA presents a trade-off that might be worthwhile if you're constrained by GPU memory. It offers 33% memory savings at the cost of a 39% increase in runtime. When finetuning LLMs, the choice of optimizer shouldn't be a major concern. While SGD on its own is suboptimal, there's minimal variation in outcomes whether you employ AdamW, SGD with a scheduler, or AdamW with a scheduler. While Adam is often labeled a memory-intensive optimizer due to its introduction of two new parameters for every model parameter, this doesn't significantly affect the peak memory demands of the LLM. This is because the majority of the memory is allocated for large matrix multiplications rather than retaining extra parameters. For static datasets, iterating multiple times, as done in multi-epoch training, might not be beneficial. It often deteriorates the results, probably due to overfitting. If you're incorporating LoRA, ensure it's applied across all layers, not just to the Key and Value matrices, to maximize model performance. Adjusting the LoRA rank is essential, and so is selecting an apt alpha value. A good heuristic is setting alpha at twice the rank's value. 7 billion parameter models can be finetuned efficiently within a few hours on a single GPU possessing 14 GB of RAM. With a static dataset, optimizing an LLM to excel across all benchmark tasks is unattainable. Addressing this requires diverse data sources, or perhaps LoRA might not be the ideal tool. In addition, I will answer ten common questions around LoRA: Q1: How Important is the Dataset? Q2: Does LoRA Work for Domain Adaptation? Q3: How Do You Select the Best Rank? Q4: Does LoRA Need to Be Enabled for All Layers? Q5: How To Avoid Overfitting? Q6: What about Other Optimizers? Q7: What Other Factors Influence Memory Usage? Q8: How Does it Compare to Full Finetuning and RLHF? Q9: Can LoRA Weights be Combined? Q10: What about Layer-wise Optimal Rank Adaptation? (In the previous issue of AI, I mentioned that I wanted to write a more general introduction with a from-scratch code implementation of LoRA sometime if there's interest. According to your feedback, there's a lot of interest, and I plan to share another article on LoRA in the future. For now, this article is focused on the broader ideas and takeaways from working with LoRA—a top-down view.) A Brief Introduction to LoRA Large language models are large, and it can be expensive to update all model weights during training due to GPU memory limitations. For example, suppose we have an LLM with 7B parameters represented in a weight matrix W. (In reality, the model parameters are, of course, distributed across different matrices in many layers, but for simplicity, we refer to a single weight matrix here). During backpropagation, we learn a ΔW matrix, which contains information on how much we want to update the original weights to minimize the loss function during training. The weight update is then as follows: Wupdated = W + ΔW If the weight matrix W contains 7B parameters, then the weight update matrix ΔW also contains 7B parameters, and computing the matrix ΔW can be very compute and memory intensive. The LoRA method proposed by Hu et al. replaces to decompose the weight changes, ΔW, into a lower-rank representation. To be precise, it does not require to explicitly compute ΔW. Instead, LoRA learns the decomposed representation of ΔW directly during training which is where the savings are coming from, as shown in the figure below. As illustrated above, the decomposition of ΔW means that we represent the large matrix ΔW with two smaller LoRA matrices, A and B. If A has the same number of rows as ΔW and B has the same number of columns as B, we can write the decomposition as ΔW = AB. (AB is the matrix multiplication result between matrices A and B.) How much memory does this save? It depends on the rank r, which is a hyperparameter. For example, if ΔW has 10,000 rows and 20,000 columns, it stores 200,000,000 parameters. If we choose A and B with r=8, then A has 10,000 rows and 8 columns, and B has 8 rows and 20,000 columns, that's 10,000×8 + 8×20,000 = 240,000 parameters, which is about 830× less than 200,000,000. Of course, A and B can't capture all the information that ΔW could capture, but this is by design. When using LoRA, we hypothesize that the model requires W to be a large matrix with full rank to capture all the knowledge in the pretraining dataset. However, when we finetune an LLM, we don't need to update all the weights and capture the core information for the adaptation in a smaller number of weights than ΔW would; hence, we have the low-rank updates via AB. 1. LoRA Consistency Running multiple experiments with LoRA, I found that the benchmark results are surprisingly consistent across the different runs despite the inherent randomness of LLM training or when training models on GPUs in general. This is a good basis for additional comparison studies. (Note that the results were obtained with default settings using a small r=8. The experimental details can be found in my other article here.) 2. QLoRA Compute-Memory Trade-offs QLoRA by Dettmers et al., short for quantized LoRA, is a technique that further reduces memory usage during finetuning. During backpropagation, QLoRA quantizes the pretrained weights to 4-bit precision and uses paged optimizers to handle memory spikes. Indeed, I found that one can save 33% of GPU memory when using LoRA. However, this comes at a 39% increased training runtime caused by the additional quantization and dequantization of the pretrained model weights in QLoRA. Default LoRA with 16-bit brain floating point precision: Training time: 1.85 h Memory used: 21.33 GB QLoRA with 4-bit Normal Floats: Training time: 2.79 h Memory used: 14.18 GB Moreover, I found that the modeling performance was barely affected, which makes QLoRA a feasible alternative to regular LoRA training to work around the common GPU memory bottleneck. 3. Learning Rate Schedulers Learning rate schedulers lower the learning rate throughout the training to optimize convergence and avoid overshooting the loss minima. Cosine annealing is a learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate following a cosine curve. It starts with a high learning rate, which then decreases smoothly, approaching zero in a cosine-like manner. A commonly used variant is the half-cycle variant, where only a half-cosine cycle is completed over the course of training, as shown in the figure below. As part of my experiments, I added a cosine annealing scheduler to the LoRA finetuning scripts and observed that it improved the SGD performance noticeably. However, it has less impact on Adam and AdamW optimizers and makes almost no difference. The potential advantages of SGD over Adam are discussed in the next section. 4. Adam vs SGD Adam and AdamW optimizers remain popular choices in deep learning even though they are very memory-intensive when we are working with large models. The reason is that Adam optimizers maintain two moving averages for each model parameter: the first moment (mean) of the gradients and the second moment (uncentered variance) of the gradients. In other words, Adam optimizers store two additional values for each single model parameter in memory. If we are working with a 7B parameter model, that's an extra 14B parameters to track during training. SGD optimizers don't need to track any additional parameters during training, so a question is: what advantage does swapping Adam by SGD have on the peak memory requirements when training LLMs? In my experiments, training a 7B parameter Llama 2 model trained with AdamW and LoRA defaults (r=8) required 14.18 GB of GPU memory. Training the same model with SGD instead required 14.15 GB of GPU memory. In other words, the savings (0.03 GB) were minimal. Why are the memory savings so small? That's because with LoRA, we only have a small number of trainable parameters. For instance, if r=8, we have 4,194,304 trainable LoRA parameters out of all 6,738,415,616 parameters in a 7B Llama 2 model. If we just look at the bare numbers, 4,194,304 trainable parameters still sound like a lot, but if we do the math, we only have 4,194,304 × 2 × 16 bit = 134.22 megabits = 16.78 megabytes. (We observed a 0.03 Gb = 30 Mb difference since there is an additional overhead in storing and copying optimizer states.) The 2 represents the number of extra parameters that Adam stores, and the 16-bit refers to the default precision for the model weights. However, if we increase the LoRA r to 256, something I've done in later experiments, the difference between Adam and SGD optimizers becomes more noticeable: 17.86 GB with AdamW 14.46 GB with SGD As a takeaway, swapping Adam optimizers with SGD may not be worthwhile when LoRA's r is small. However, it may be worthwhile when we are increasing r. 5. Multiple Training Epochs In conventional deep learning, we often iterate over a training set multiple times -- an iteration over the training set is called an epoch. It's common to run hundreds of training epochs when training convolutional neural networks, for example. Is multi-epoch training useful for instruction finetuning as well? When I increased the number of iterations for the 50k-example Alpaca instruction finetuning dataset by a factor of two (analogous to 2 training epochs), I noticed a decline in model performance. The takeaway is that multi-epoch training might not benefit instruction finetuning since it can deteriorate the results. I observed the same with the 1k-example LIMA dataset. This performance decline is likely due to increased overfitting, which warrants additional investigation. Ahead of AI is a reader-supported publication.

Enable LoRA for More Layers The tables above showed experiments where LoRA was only enabled for select weight matrices, i.e., the Key and Value weight matrices in each transformer layer. In addition, we can also enable LoRA for the Query weight matrices, the projection layers, the other linear layers between the multihead attention blocks, and the linear output layer. If we enable LoRA for all these additional layers, we increase the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5, from 4,194,304 to 20,277,248, for a 7B Llama 2 model. This also comes with a larger memory requirement (16.62 GB instead of 14.18 GB) but can increase the modeling performance noticeably. However, a limitation of my experiment is that I only explored two settings: (1) LoRA for only the query and value weight matrices enabled, and (2) LoRA for all layers enabled. It might be worthwhile exploring the other combinations in future experiments. For example, it would be interesting to know whether activating LoRA for the projection layer is actually beneficial. 7. Balancing LoRA Hyperparameters: R and Alpha As the original LoRA paper outlines, LoRA introduces an additional scaling coefficient for applying the LoRA weights to the pretrained weights during the forward pass. The scaling involves the rank parameter r, which we discussed earlier, as well as another hyperparameter α (alpha) that is applied as follows: scaling = alpha / r weight += (lora_B @ lora_A) * scaling As we can see in the code formula above, the larger the influence of the LoRA weights. Previous experiments used r=8 and alpha=16, which resulted in a 2-fold scaling. Choosing alpha as two times r is a common rule of thumb when using LoRA for LLMs, but I was curious if this still holds for larger r values. In other words, “alpha = 2×rank” really seems to be a sweet spot. (I experimented with r=32, r=64, r=128, and r=512 but omitted the results for clarity as r=256 resulted in the best performance.) Indeed, the choosing alpha as two times as large as r resulted in the best outcomes. 8. Training 7B Parameter Models on a Single GPU One of the main takeaways is that LoRA allows us to finetune 7B parameter LLMs on a single GPU. In this particular case, using QLoRA with the best setting (r=256 and alpha=512), this 17.86 GB with AdamW takes about 3 hours (on an A100) for 50k training examples (here, the Alpaca dataset). In the remaining sections of this article, I am answering additional questions you might have. Answers to Common Questions Q1: How Important is the Dataset? The dataset can be critical. I used the Alpaca dataset, which contains 50k training examples, for my experiments. I chose this dataset because it's quite popular, and experimenting with different datasets was out of scope due to the already extensive length of the article. However, it's worth noting that Alpaca is a synthetic dataset that was generated by querying an old version of ChatGPT and is probably not the best by today's standards. Data quality can be very important. For example, in June, I discussed the LIMA dataset (Ahead of AI #9: LLM Tuning & Dataset Perspectives), a curated dataset consisting of only 1k examples. According to the LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment paper, a 65B Llama model finetuned on LIMA noticeably outperforms a 65B Llama model finetuned on Alpaca. Using the best configuration (r=256, alpha=512) on LIMA, I got similar, if not better, performance than the 50x larger Alpaca dataset. Q2: Does LoRA Work for Domain Adaptation? Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer to this question. As a rule of thumb, knowledge is usually absorbed from the pretraining dataset. Instruction finetuning is generally more about helping or guiding the LLM towards following instructions. However, it's worth noting that if memory is a concern, LoRA can also be used for further pretraining existing pretrained LLMs on domain-specific datasets. Note that my experiments also included two arithmetic benchmarks (they are included in my other more technical write-up), on which LoRA-finetuned models performed significantly worse than the pretrained base models. My hypothesis is that the model unlearned arithmetic because the Alpaca dataset did not contain corresponding examples. Whether the model completely lost the knowledge or whether it's because the model can't handle the instructions anymore would require further investigation. However, a takeaway here is that it's probably a good idea to include examples of each task you care about when finetuning LLMs. Q3: How Do You Select the Best Rank? Unfortunately, I don't have any good heuristic for selecting a good r and think that it's a hyperparameter that needs to be explored for each LLM and each dataset. I suspect that choosing an r that is too large could result in more overfitting. On the other hand, a small r may not be able to capture diverse tasks in a dataset. In other words, I suspect that the more diverse the tasks in the dataset, the larger the r should be. For example, if I only want a model that carries out basic 2-digit arithmetic, then a tiny r might already be sufficient. However, this is only a hypothesis and would require additional investigation. Q4: Does LoRA Need to Be Enabled for All Layers? I only explored two settings: (1) LoRA for only the query and value weight matrices enabled, and (2) LoRA for all layers enabled. It might be worthwhile exploring the other combinations in future experiments. For example, it would be interesting to know whether activating LoRA for the projection layer is actually beneficial. For instance, if we consider the various settings (lora_query, lora_key, lora_value, lora_projection, lora_mlp, and lora_head), that's 2^6 = 64 combinations to explore. This exploration would be an interesting topic for future studies. Q5: How To Avoid Overfitting? Generally, a larger r can lead to more overfitting because it determines the number of trainable parameters. If a model suffers from overfitting, decreasing r or increasing the dataset size are the first candidates to explore. Moreover, you could try to increase the weight decay rate in AdamW or SGD optimizers, and you can consider increasing the dropout value for LoRA layers. The LoRA dropout parameter that I haven't explored in my experiments (I used a fixed dropout rate of 0.05), is an interesting topic for future investigations. Q6: What about Other Optimizers? Other interesting optimizers for LLMs are worth exploring in the future. One such optimizer is Sophia: A Scalable Stochastic Second-order Optimizer for Language Model Pre-training, which was published in May. Sophia is a second-order optimization algorithm that promises to be particularly attractive for LLMs where Adam and AdamW are usually the dominant ones. Compared to Adam, Sophia is 2× faster, and models trained with Sophia can achieve better modeling performance, according to the paper. In a nutshell, Sophia normalizes the gradients by gradient curvature instead of gradient variance, as in Adam. Q7: What Other Factors Influence Memory Usage? Besides precision and quantization settings, the model size, the batch size, and the number of trainable LoRA parameters, the dataset can also influence memory usage. Note that Llama 2 has a block size of 4048. For instance, if an LLM has a block size of 4048 tokens, it can process sequences of up to 4048 tokens at once. However, shorter training sequences can result in substantial memory savings due to the masking of future tokens. For example, the Alpaca dataset is relatively small, with a maximum length of 1304 tokens. When I experimented with other datasets that had lengths of up to 2048 tokens, I noticed that the memory usage went up from 17.86 GB to 26.96 GB. Q8: How Does it Compare to Full Finetuning and RLHF? I did not run any RLHF experiments (for those who are curious, I covered RLHF here), but I did consider full finetuning. Full finetuning required at least 2 GPUs and was completed in 3.5 h using 36.66 GB on each GPU. However, the benchmark results were not very good, likely due to overfitting or suboptimal hyperparameters. Q9: Can LoRA Weights be Combined? Yes, it's possible to combine multiple sets of LoRA weights. During training, we keep the LoRA weights separate from the pretrained weights and add them during each forward pass. However, If you have a real-world application with many sets of LoRA weights, for example, one set for each application customer, it makes sense to store these weights separately to save disk space. However, it's possible to merge the pretrained weights with the LoRA weights after training to create a single model. This way, we don't have to apply the LoRA weights in each forward pass: weight += (lora_B @ lora_A) * scaling Instead, we apply the weight update as shown above and save the merged (added) weights. Similarly, we can keep adding multiple LoRA weight sets: weight += (lora_B_set1 @ lora_A_set1) * scaling_set1 weight += (lora_B_set2 @ lora_A_set2) * scaling_set2 weight += (lora_B_set3 @ lora_A_set3) * scaling_set3 ... I have yet to do experiments to evaluate the performance of such an approach, but this is technically already possible via the scripts/merge_lora.py script provided in Lit-GPT. Q10: What about Layer-wise Optimal Rank Adaptation? For simplicity, we usually train deep neural networks with the same learning rate for each layer, and the learning rate is a hyperparameter that we need to optimize. To take it further, we can also choose a different learning rate for each layer (in PyTorch, this is not too complicated). However, it's rarely done in practice because it adds additional overhead, and there are usually already so many knobs to tune when training deep neural networks. Analogous to choosing different learning rates for different layers, we can also choose different LoRA ranks for different layers. I haven't found any experiments on this, but a document that details this approach is Layer-wise Optimal Rank Adaptation (also abbreviated LORA). In theory, this sounds like a good idea in practice. However, it also adds an extensive number of choices when optimizing hyperparameters. If you're familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning but are looking to bridge some knowledge gaps, the 30 chapters in my new book Machine Learning and AI Beyond the Basics answer critical questions in the field.

Like \"these are the techniques that work best for lightweight models\" but not necessarily assuming those as a general rule of thumb for \"heavyweight models.\"Even something like the discussion of synthetic data on model collapse is a good example of where there might be a very significant difference in the effect on model quality for a cheaper and less sophisticated model generating synthetic data to feed back into itself and a much more complex and sophisticated model. Maybe the lesson is actually \"recursive training on synthetic data leads to model collapse in lightweight and medium weight models.\"So while the writeup is a great one on fine tuning 7B models with LoRA, I would be curious just what % of the recommendations hold true in replication for even just a 65B model. reply zer00eyz 7 hours agoparent> research on methodology is concentrated in smaller and more accessible model experimentationLets pull out a part of the article: \"Note that my experiments also included two arithmetic benchmarks (they are included in my other more technical write-up), on which LoRA-finetuned models performed significantly worse than the pretrained base models.

If anything the research kicked off with Orca into using more complex models to jumpstart fine tuning of much smaller models is probably my pick for the most important ML research trend of 2023.But even in the example you bring up and your comments on it, I&#x27;d strongly recommend considering Goodhart&#x27;s Law - turning a handful of measurements into the target by which we are throwing other things away to improve model scores on those measurements doesn&#x27;t necessarily represent a path to best in class production feasibility.I can imagine a number of edge cases where a customer service bot not having basic math capabilities could lead to issues (\"Did the package come with at least 4 screws?\" \"It only had three\" \"Ok, great - I don&#x27;t see any issues with the shipment and am denying the return request\").Further, many qualities which probably do matter for applications like customer service, like patience, empathy, or de-escalation - don&#x27;t happen to be parts of the measurements any LLMs are being optimized to hit (even though they are almost certainly represented at least in part in the pretrained models given the presence in the data).We&#x27;ve become a bit too focused on optimizing LLMs around measurements reflecting our anchoring biases of what AI should look like as imagined decades ago rather than evaluating the starting point and use cases as they actually occur as we might for a tool by any other name.Though this is all an entirely different issue from whether different model sizes require their own best practices. reply nl 8 hours agoprevThis is an exceptionally useful article.

There’s a weird overlap happening here of environmental collapse at the same moment that we’re learning just how rich that diversity is, what it means, how to use it. Hell, transgenic rices and grains - the engine of the green revolution - were all remixed landrace species, which are in danger now of being replaced by monocrops.The loss of species is a tragedy because it’s a tragedy, but it’s also a tragedy because we’re destroying our inheritance at an alarming rate before we ever really get to see what it is or what it could be. Billions of years of prior art, gone. reply mlsu 6 hours agoparentI think of it in terms of energy.Evolution is a process that takes a lot of energy. Every lifetime is a lifetime of energy that has been harnessed to continue the process. So when a species goes extinct, it&#x27;s not just the energy of all of the living members, but all of the ancestors of all of the living members as well that is destroyed.Sort of like expending a bunch of energy to train a neural network, and then rm -rf the weights.Such a waste. reply leptons 5 hours agorootparent>the energy of all of the living members, but all of the ancestors of all of the living members as well that is destroyedThe law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. reply steve_adams_86 4 hours agorootparentIn this context, what’s destroyed isn’t the energy itself but the product that was yielded from the work it enabled. reply klysm 5 hours agorootparentprevIt sure as hell can be wasted though reply BenFranklin100 6 hours agoparentprevI work in biotech as well, and the idea that the extinction of 21 species from an estimate 8M+ species has any sort of meaningful impact on biomedical research or the understanding of basic biology is ludicrous.Further your post is histrionic. ‘Environmental collapse’, ‘destroying our inheritance’, ‘alarming rate’, suggests an individual who is pushing an agenda rather than rationally appraising the current state of the ever-changing environment and biological ecosystem. reply pvaldes 1 hour agorootparentnot so ludicrous. Some species are more important than the other. In terms of biomedicine, the lack of a single species having evolved a unique substance could change the human history.Without knowing the list, we can&#x27;t infer a lot about the impact or lack of impact. Some of those species could be obscure hybrids without real impact, the lack of other could be potentially catastrophic; but the effects would have been forgotten by now and assimilated as \"the new normality\".

It&#x27;s one of the first images that pop up when you punch &#x27;chigger&#x27; into Google, and it appears to be licensed (and mislabeled) by Getty. Tracking the image back to its original source, it was clearly identified as a red velvet mite.I wish publications wouldn&#x27;t do this.

This [1] graph is telling. There have been numerous extinction events, even before the existence of humanity. So the survival rate of species looks much more like a sine wave than it does some sort of linear graph. Life, even on a species level, is brief. It creates an interesting balance between humanity and nature. The one solution to this problem is to expand - make life multiplanetary, and not just human life. Human industrialization is certainly causing plentiful destruction, yet it will also likely be the one thing that may possibly save the lives of countless species.So for instance the most popularly known mass extinction event was the dinosaurs, like caused by an asteroid impact some ~15km large. If there was such an asteroid on an impact course today, we could probably detect it a bit before it impacted - but not do a whole heck of a lot more. We could launch every single nuke we have and it would be like throwing baseballs at a semi-truck. By contrast when it lands, it would be the equivalent of hundreds of millions of nukes going off, and the ash of the impact would completely blot out the sky. Those who survived the initial impact would die from either starvation, freezing, or lack of oxygen as all plants and wildlife gradually died off.Anyhow, space tech is important. And we&#x27;re only able to achieve such thanks to human industrialization and spread. Paradoxical, but such is the nature of all technological progress which invariably brings problems ultimately only solved by even more advances which, again, bring their own problems. It makes life feel like a game, or maybe we just make games modeled after life.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Extinction_intensity.svg [from the page at] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extinction_event reply bmitc 2 hours agorootparent> He&#x27;s presumably referring to a geologic timescale. This [1] graph is telling. There have been numerous extinction events, even before the existence of humanity.All of those were caused by global Earth-level geological events or extraterrestrial objects such as massive asteroids. The latest extinction event is caused by a single species. It is absolutely an exceptional extinction event and the only one of its kind.> Human industrialization is certainly causing plentiful destruction, yet it will also likely be the one thing that may possibly save the lives of countless species.Technology will never not create more problems as it attempts to solve problems caused by other technology. reply somenameforme 1 hour agorootparentThe point about technology is that there is no choice. It&#x27;s not like if we did nothing, everything would just live happily ever after. Every species on this planet is living on borrowed time. Literally the only choice for the persistence is advancement and expansion, which of course will also cause numerous negative effects along its course.Also, the first [1] (and one of the most extreme) extinction events ever was indeed caused by a single species, cyanobacteria. Prior to the evolutionary development of photosynthesis, there was plentiful simple life on the planet. The evolutionary emergence of photosynthesis resulted in a dramatic and rapid introduction of oxygen into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere which was exceptionally toxic to the existing abiotic species. We only think of oxygen as a good thing, because we evolved in its presence. If there was an advanced species that managed to evolve in abiotic circumstance, we&#x27;d probably look as weird to them as a creature that breathes gaseous arsenic would look to us![1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Oxidation_Event reply pvaldes 1 hour agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t this just how life on Earth works tho?Is more like how dead on Earth worksIf the goal is returning the planet to their original status of lifeless floating rock for billions of years, we are doing a spectacular job in just a glimpse of time.

There are not infinite amount of species, and the number is decreasing at thousands of times the background extinction rate.

But the rate of change is too fast for even them to survive to what is coming. reply drexlspivey 8 hours agoprevCan someone make the case using logical arguments on why a higher number of species is any better or worse than a lower number? Why is an ecosystem in equilibrium with 10 million species better than one with 8? reply tmountain 7 hours agoparentMore species means greater potential for adaptation as ecosystems shift. If one niche species dies off, there’s greater potential for a neighboring species to fill the gap.On the same token, more species means more genetic diversity and higher levels of resilience to diseases and other threats.Different species service ecosystems in different ways. Pollination, water purification, soil enrichment, etc. With too few species, key requirements for cross species survival are less likely to be met.On a less scientific basis, more species just makes the planet richer. The thought of just a few dominant species across the planet is a very sad prospect and would represent a huge loss regarding the beauty that billions of years of evolution have brought us. reply BurningFrog 5 hours agorootparent> More species means greater potential for adaptation as ecosystems shiftOf course, somewhat paradoxically, these species disappearing is an adaptation to shifting ecosystems.What&#x27;s happening now is that ecosystems are globalizing. An ecological niche that was filled by 30 local species before modernity, is now being mixed up and whichever species is \"best\" may fill that niche everywhere.So if my local frog species disappears, it&#x27;s probably replaced by more hardworking immigrant frogs. This can be very disruptive and have negative consequences in many ways. But it doesn&#x27;t mean animal life disappears. It changes. reply steve_adams_86 4 hours agorootparentArguably it has been disappearing; there is less animal biomass in most of the world than there was since we began keeping record. reply refurb 2 hours agorootparentprevBut there is already diversity within species. Species are a human construct developed to describe similar groups of living organisms.Look at the diversity within canis lupus familiaris, the domesticated dog.Yes a moth with different wing shape is regarded as a separate species. reply francisofascii 8 hours agoparentprevThe irreversibility is probably the key negative. If you assume life is good and biodiversity aids in keeping life going, then the more species that are stable, the better. And species take a long time to create, so losing them precipitously is most likely bad. reply Loughla 8 hours agoparentprevMore resilience to disease or collapse maybe? Honestly, other than &#x27;because I like animals&#x27;, I don&#x27;t really know though.I would be interested in the answer to this as well. reply steve_adams_86 4 hours agorootparentResilience is one thing, but there are a lot of nuances to what makes species and habitat diversity so important.This isn’t a perfect example, but the other day I was researching shrimp. There is a genus called neocaridina, and they’re generally detritivores. However, I discovered that many species in the genus eat quite differently. Some will eat hair algae, some won’t. Some like to feed on hard algae, some only soft. Some have preference for higher protein foods, others less. Of the 26 known species, the manifestation of their presence in an ecosystem would actually be quite different.This is a single genus which would have substantially varying impacts on ponds, streams, and lakes for example. If you have a diverse set of these species, you will be far more likely to keep a variety of detritus and algae sources in check. Reduce the diversity, and perhaps hair algae will get out of control. Once this happens, you might see certain fish or insects lose their habitat because they depend on other vegetation, but the hair algae is absorbing too much light and nutrients now.This is applies to all kinds of animals, in all kinds of habitats. Diversity means greater balance, greater stability, and means of recovering faster when things collapse. reply beebeepka 6 hours agoparentprevCan someone make the case using logical arguments on why drexlspivey is any better or worse than no drexlspivey?

In a pinch, they might be able to deal with others things. A W, perhaps. If the W-predating species suffers disease or some calamity, this other species can, to some degree, pick up the slack. It&#x27;s really a key part of adaptive radiation. Maybe I could live here, although I don&#x27;t usually. Maybe I could mate there, although it is a bit out of my comfort zone.When you play those simulation games with just a few species, you see a lot of boom-bust cycles and eventually you get a collapse. Similarly, those sealed terrariums have similar problems: they eventually fall into a lower equilibrium of fewer species and then they kind of turn to mush.I hesitate to say \"role\" because that feels assigned, but different species do different things in an overlapping fashion, like a cross-trained staff lowering your \"bus factor.\"Now, I imagine there&#x27;s some kind of maximum number (so many species that finding someone to breed with is hard), but the minimums lack resiliency for various cycles. reply stevenally 6 hours agoparentprevNope.

We&#x27;re at the top of a wide spectrum of intelligence, but it&#x27;s startling the degree to which even secularly-minded people see our species as different in kind than the rest of the animal kingdom—I normally associate that kind of human exceptionalism with religion.I&#x27;m not familiar enough with birds to speak about them, but other mammalian species absolutely understand loneliness, and understand the difference between having human friends and having friends of their same species. reply appplication 11 hours agorootparentI agree with you that I think there is some fundamental truth with humans not being any different than animals, or really plants, etc for that matter. That life is a stubborn, collective, anti-entropic force fighting - for a bit at least - against the cold eventuality of the universe. And in that picture it’s difficult to place humans as logically superior to or separate from any other force of life.On the other hand, I have a hard time squaring that with practical morality. If all life is equally valuable, we all commit the crime of murder just to eat and survive. That does not feel quite right. And if we say that life is maybe not so valuable, then does it mean the crime of murder itself is not wrong? I think that also doesn’t feel right.So maybe it’s not that all life is equally valuable, but rather life is valuable. Equality is a human construction, after all - unchecked nature is much more vicious in dealing with inequality in the margins. Life consumes life, that is how it is. It is a cycle that doesn’t quite repeat, and there is no destruction of life in sustenance, only transformation.And maybe that is what happens when one species - or a million - dies out. Perhaps that is nature’s brutal callousness in action, and as such is a perfectly natural thing to happen. I don’t think I quite like that either.Every time I have a deep think on the way things are, I’m reminded of the Buddhists, who I think found at least some truth in it all: “life is suffering”. I’m not sure there’s much more to it than that. reply Dalewyn 12 hours agorootparentprev>I think we humans overestimate how unique we are.That a lot of us refuse to see ourselves as part of the animal kingdom is indication enough.Let&#x27;s also not forget our pompous assumption that only humans can make and use tools (debunked), only humans can feel emotions (debunked), and so on.If something ferocious ever comes around to knock humanity down several pegs, it will be very deserved. reply softg 11 hours agorootparentI mean is it that unreasonable to think that humans are radically different from any other species we know?

A study about chimps using sticks to hunt termites isn&#x27;t going to be enough to bridge that gap.\"Deserved\" is a human concept.

Amphibian, fish, mollusk, and insect species are far more numerous and at far more risk. reply kbenson 13 hours agorootparentI would assume you would just take genetic samples in the easiest, and most durable form.I think the answer to your question is that if it&#x27;s easier to reverse our course then a bunch of species will be dead with no way to revive them. Easier does not mean easy, and reversing course is IMO next to impossible, so it bei g harder than that just means it won&#x27;t happen. reply undersuit 11 hours agorootparentSo it&#x27;s not a vault it&#x27;s a digital archive. Still the action of scanning in the DNA for future use. Just on lizards still, biggest project humanities ever taken. reply kbenson 6 hours agorootparentI would assume you&#x27;d want that digital archive in a vault for the same reasons we put seeds kn the seed vault. Like the seed vault, the only copy doesn&#x27;t need to (nor should it) exist just in the vault, but that&#x27;s a good location to make sure at least one copy survives. reply undersuit 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m still talking about how hard it is... just for the 7000 known species of lizards.\"We show that as of June 2021, 3,278 unique animals have had their nuclear genome sequenced and the assembly made publicly available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (10). This translates to 0.2% of all animal species.\"It&#x27;s a huge project! Just lizards are double the number of complete screens we have.We should definitely try and get the tech going. It will have uses to recover even endangered species in the near future, but it&#x27;s not a smart use of our resources for saving us \"after\" something happens. reply kbenson 33 minutes agorootparentWell, you said digital, but that&#x27;s not the only way to do it. Blood in a stabilizer of some sort (if it exists) or some other carrier of genetic material was more along the lines of what I meant. That&#x27;s much easier to do (maybe? I&#x27;m not sure what it takes to stabilize it over a long time frame), but takes a lot more physical space.I agree it&#x27;s not something that is necessarily immediately useful right after a problem, but it&#x27;s something better to have than not. Reconstructing the wooly mammoth DNA required filling in somewhat large gaps with elephant DNA if I recall correctly, so even if we are able to resurrect the wooly mammoth with it, it won&#x27;t really be a wooly mammoth, it will be mostly one, to the best of our ability. Something definitive tracking species would likely be greatly appreciated by future generations. replyChatGTP 12 hours agorootparentprevI love the sentiment but the time to reverse our course was probably in the 60s.

The actual document[¹] is interesting because it includes some responses to peer reviewers and goes more into methodology. The species that were just declared extinct haven&#x27;t been seen for decades. In some cases, the animal has probably actually been extinct for 50+ years, they&#x27;re just (understandably) very cautious about declaring it. It would be awkward to have another coelacanth situation.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalregister.gov&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;2023-22... reply bmitc 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a good point, although in this case you can count the number of wild vaquitas on two hands.

They are not at all a keystone species. In most of the places where they cause widespread misery and death they&#x27;re not even a native species, they&#x27;re invasive. reply titzer 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not that they carry diseases, though that&#x27;s not great for species that get those diseases, it&#x27;s that this particular species of mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is really just a pest we bring with us. They aren&#x27;t native to most places and pretty much follow us around and prey on us, piggy backing on the most invasive species of all. reply JoshTriplett 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, it would have an impact on the ecosystem. We could study the potential impact, and decide whether it was more or less of a concern than the number of lives lost to mosquito-borne diseases. reply temp0826 11 hours agorootparentprevI remember reading that some types are also pollinators, and maybe even the sole pollinators for some particular plants. reply nerpderp82 11 hours agorootparentprevThey also move nutrients down the foodchain.

There are under 100k distinct \"animals\" in the sense we usually think of the word (mammals, reptiles, birds). reply burkaman 10 hours agoparentprevThat is a lot lower than I would have guessed (only 300,000 plant species on the entire planet?). I think the number of known species, 2.16 million, is the better comparison here, because we&#x27;re talking about known extinctions.Also, this is just extinctions in the US, but I can&#x27;t find a good number of known species that exist in the US. For one example, 10 of the 21 species labeled as extinct here are birds, and there seem to be roughly 900 species of birds in the United States. So 10 seems like a lot. There are also 8 extinct mussel species out of 297 known in North America. reply BurningFrog 9 hours agorootparentPart of what makes this hard is that \"species\" isn&#x27;t a clearly defined concept.So, depending on which definition you use, you can get very different numbers. reply dukeofdoom 8 hours agoprevReplaced by 21 new species of cockroaches, in just NY. thanks to humans.

Me reply FranzFerdiNaN 2 hours agoparent> Just want to see someone interview him who is as smart as himJust send the average five year old. reply dukeofdoom 8 hours agoprevSome extinctions are not necessarily because of humans. For example, one species of birds will develop specialized beaks to eat a specific food source, which might lead to it dominating for a while. Especially on an Island like Hawaii.Then conditions change, due to weather, or new plant species gaining foot hold, and that bird may start being outcompeted by a different bird that will eat its specialized food source, or that food source is no longer as prevalent.Hawaii does have a lot of boomer invaders. Always wondered how long it would take in a war, before they started eating each other. Hawaii is not food secure by any means. It&#x27;s almost all container ships feeding the island.Nature will find a balance. reply contingencies 14 hours agoprevnext [10 more] [flagged] Exoristos 8 hours agoparentThis is such an asinine trope.

That means either fires or logging are essential to their survival. So if you mean don’t pave over forests, then yes. But logging done properly is essential for a lot of species. reply titzer 11 hours agorootparent> But logging done properly is essential for a lot of species.Hard disagree here. These species survived in niches carved out by forest fires and ruminants that keep open grasslands, prairies, and other in-between states from endlessly sprouting forests. Obviously they survived for millions of years before man came to North America.The natural carbon cycle where trees grow, live, reproduce, then die and decay, to be food for endless levels of fungus, insects, worms, grubs, etc, which in turn feed birds, snakes, frogs...I could go on, but I think you miss how utterly disruptive it is just to remove the dead tree trunks from an environment.Sustainable logging looks OK in the 50-100 year timeframe; it&#x27;s one of many lies we tell ourselves. If it worked for Grandpa then it&#x27;ll work for us. Maybe the soil quality holds up in the long run, maybe not? But make no mistake, logging has a vast impact and permanently alters ecosystems. Do logged forests slowly decline over centuries as their soil is depleted?

So I guess we are on the positive side. reply abenga 6 hours agoparentDiscovered, not newly evolved. It doesn&#x27;t matter that we know about a species or not, that causes no change in the level of biodiversity. Species becoming extinct on the other hand affects biodiversity. reply imgabe 10 hours agoprev [–] What is the optimal number of species? Is there a universally optimal number or does it depend on conditions on the planet? On one extreme, if each individual organism were its own species, nothing would be able to mate and everything would die. If everything were one species, one disease or change in environment could wipe everything out. So, those clearly are bad. But somewhere in the middle must be a \"best\" number for some metric. Ecological resilience would probably be a good metric, if we could measure that.There is the assumption in a lot of the environmental rhetoric that whatever number of species and the exact types of species that existed ~200 years ago when we started keeping track are the optimal ones and that they should stay that way forever. It doesn&#x27;t work that way though. If a species goes extinct, it&#x27;s because its environment changed and it&#x27;s no longer adapted to it. Whether the source of that change is another species (humans) or something else is irrelevant. A new species will come along that&#x27;s better adapted. reply hunter-gatherer 9 hours agoparent(Personal opinion with no intent to argue or pursuade) I think you are asking the wrong optimisation question. Indeed species have been going extinct forever and differing rates. I think what we should be optimizing for is quality. I remember as a kid growing up in SE Utah just being overwhelmed with insect, reptile, amphibian, and small game wildlife in the area. You didn&#x27;t look for it, it was just around. I visit frequently and have been amazed at the decline I&#x27;ve witnessed in just 30 years. So few of everything. Now we search for lizards and horned toads. I hardly ever see butterflies and bees. It&#x27;s [not] wild. I also just drove in August from SE Idaho to Tacoma. Mostly through Montana and Idaho. I didn&#x27;t have to clean my windshield once the entire trip, there and back. I remember driving as a teenager it seemed like I always had to clean my windshield, even driving on I-15 from Salt Lake city to SE Idaho. Cleaning dead bugs off my windshield is something I don&#x27;t need to do anymore. I haven&#x27;t done it for a long time.We could model our existence in a way to just optmize for our species existence. Humans have been running species into existence for a long time in order to populate. I think we should optimize the other way though. I think we would if we assumed that our mentally advanced status assumed a stewardship-like responsibility. Instead we take and take and take. I&#x27;ve been guilty as anyone, but have tried to be more mindful as I&#x27;ve gotten older and limit my consumption, and make sacrifices to do so where I see nobody else in my immediate sphere doing the same. I do that because I liked having nature be outside my doorstep. I don&#x27;t think there is an asumption that there was or is an optimal number of species, I think it is just that some people have seen a tranformation that they don&#x27;t like. reply jdiff 9 hours agoparentprev [–] This is a borderline nonsensical question, because this isn&#x27;t something you can solve for X. What those species are and what niche they fill matters quite a lot. Genetic diversity within these species also matters. Countless other things matter. The rate of extinction has gone up drastically, and there are not new species cropping up to fill the growing holes. reply imgabe 6 hours agorootparent [–] That&#x27;s the point. If you don&#x27;t even know what the optimum is or what you should even optimize for, why jump to the conclusion that some change is bad?If a species is extinct there is no hole. The hole it filled in the ecosystem is gone. If it were still there, it wouldn&#x27;t be extinct. There will be a different hole and a different species. Yes, they don&#x27;t come up overnight, but life will evolve to exploit an opportunity where there is one. reply jdiff 5 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t true. Holes can become unlivable for a species for other reasons than the hole vanishing. The hole still exists, and further the collapse of the species filling it leads other species to collapse, creating growing fissures. Now, wounds heal, yes, if and only if given the time to. If you chop off your entire arm, you&#x27;ll bleed out long before it scars over. reply doubloon 4 hours agorootparentprev [–] Monoculture is a security and resiliency risk whether it is in technological or in biological systems.You do not know the optimum because you do not know the threats. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window) Link Copied Transportation Cruise co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt resigns Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan / 2:22 AM UTC•November 20, 2023 Comment Image Credits: Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch Kyle Vogt, the serial entrepreneur who co-founded and led Cruise from a startup in a garage through its acquisition and ownership by General Motors, has resigned, according to an email sent to employees Sunday evening that TechCrunch has viewed. In a separate internal email, also viewed by TechCrunch, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra announced that Mo Elshenawy, who is executive vice president of engineering at Cruise, will serve as president and CTO for Cruise. Craig Glidden, a Cruise board member and GM’s EVP of legal and policy who was recently put in charge of as chief administrative officer at Cruise, will continue in that role. Jon McNeill, a member of GM’s board, has been appointed vice chairman of the Cruise board. McNeill, who joined the Cruise board recently and was previously chief operating officer at Lyft and president of Tesla, will now serve alongside Cruise Board Chair Mary Barra. A statement from a Cruise spokesperson confirms Barra’s email. As of Sunday, no one had been named to the CEO spot. The executive shakeup comes a less than a month after the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended Cruise’s permits to operate self-driving vehicles on public roads after an October 2 incident that saw a pedestrian – who had been initially hit by a human-driven car and landed in the path of a Cruise robotaxi – run over and dragged 20 feet by the AV. A video, which TechCrunch viewed a day after the incident, showed the robotaxi braking aggressively and coming to a stop over the woman. The DMV’s order of suspension stated that Cruise withheld about seven seconds of video footage, which showed the robotaxi then attempting to pull over and subsequently dragging the woman 20 feet. Vogt’s email sent to all employees — and viewed by TechCrunch — reads: I have resigned from my position as CEO of Cruise. The last 10 years have been amazing, and I’m grateful to everyone who helpeds Cruise along the way. The startup I launched in my garage has given over 250,000 driverless rides across several cities, with each ride inspiring people with a small taste of the future. Cruise is still just getting started, and I believe it has a great future ahead. You all are brilliant, driven and resilient. I’m deeply saddened I won’t be working next to you anymore. However, I know you’re executing against a very strong, multi-year technology roadmap and exciting product vision, and I’m thrilled to see what Cruise has in store in its next chapter! Cruisers, you’ve got this! Regardless of what originally brought you to work on AVs, remember why this work matters. The status quo on our roads sucks, but together we’ve proven there is something far better around the corner. Vogt also posted a message Sunday evening on the social media site X that used similar language as the internal email. He ended the social media thread with this message “As for what’s next for me, I plan to spend time with my family and explore some new ideas. Thanks for the great ride!” Barra’s internal email, which was sent about 15 minutes after Vogt sent his, thanked him for this “tremendous vision, passion and dedication over the past decade.” The emailed continued: “The Cruise Board understands and respects his decision to resign as CEO, and we wish him well in his next chapter. We continue to believe strongly in Cruise’s mission and the potential of its transformative technology as we look to make transportation safer, cleaner and more accessible.” Barra later emphasized that “the board and I also want you to know that we are intensely focused on setting Cruise up for long-term success. Public trust is essential to this. As we work to rebuild that trust, safety, transparency and accountability will be our north stars.” Morale at Cruise has been low since the October 2 incident, with employees pointing the finger at poor management that didn’t prioritize safety at the company. Without commercial permits to operate in San Francisco and an internal decision to pause its driverless fleets in other states, the company laid off contract workers, further deepening the malaise. The initial layoffs included contract workers who had jobs cleaning, charging and maintaining the vehicles as well as answering customer support inquiries. Not all contingent workers, who are employed by a third party, were laid off. However, more layoffs are expected at the company that employs about 4,000 full-time employees. Employee discontent was further inflamed last week when Cruise suspended its employee share-selling program for the fourth quarter. Sources who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity said they could lose upwards of tens of thousands of dollars as a result of this decision. Over the weekend, Cruise backtracked on that move. Vogt sent out an email Saturday saying that certain employees could sell a limited number of shares in a one-time opportunity. Vogt didn’t provide many details but said the company was developing a plan to conduct a new tender offer to provide restricted stock unit liquidity to mitigate potential tax implications. TechCrunch has viewed the email. Vogt went on to offer his staff a blanket apology for “the situation Cruise is in today.” Vogt and Cruise’s chief product officer Dan Kan founded the autonomous vehicle company in 2013. Initially, the pair had focused on kits that could retrofit a vehicle and turn it into a self-driving car. The startup soon pivoted to a different business model. GM took interest and acquired the company in March 2016 in a deal of cash and stock valued at more than $1 billion. Previously, Vogt had co-founded Justin.tv, a website that allowed anyone to broadcast video online, Twitch, a live-streaming platform, and Socialcam, a mobile social video app. Twitch was acquired by Amazon in 2014 for $970 million, and Socialcam by Autodesk for $60 million in 2012.

He had a deep technical understanding of the system, a great intuition for unnecessary complexity, and a constant desire to find and resolve engineering bottlenecks. And he was deeply motivated by a goal of safety and saving lives.After the GM acquisition, he could have enjoyed an early retirement. GM were eager to give us all Windows laptops and turn us into a San Francisco outpost, just as they had done with their Sidecar acquisition. But instead, Kyle worked tirelessly to ensure we had sufficient freedom and independence to build.I know this wasn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s experience with Kyle. I know plenty of people he pushed too hard and who left much earlier than I did. But for every person who burned out, there were others motivated by his energy and loved who working for him.Is Cruise over? Probably not. There are still a ton of extremely smart people working there, and they are still in possession of a world-leading AV technology (probably second only to Waymo, who had a 5 year head start). But I hope they can maintain their Silicon Valley culture and not succumb to becoming a complete GM outpost. reply pc 5 hours agoparentI knew Kyle in college. He was extremely smart, kind, patient, and friendly. (He was a few years ahead of me; I was a random Irish freshman who had just shown up.) Looking back, he&#x27;s one of the people who inspired me to get into startups. While we never ended up working together, it wasn&#x27;t for lack of trying on my side -- everyone said he was phenomenal, and I tried hard to persuade him to join Stripe in the early days. reply sroussey 4 hours agorootparentIn the early days at Weebly, we decided to use Stripe.pc gave me his mobile number and answered at 3am when I was in a panic during our launch of e-commerce.Much respect. reply jamestimmins 3 hours agorootparentprevMIT has no shortage of exceptional people; was there something that stood out about Kyle among even that crowd? reply xstthr 4 hours agorootparentprevDo you think the Kyles of today would join or excel in the politics at Stripe today? reply exogeny 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is as good of an endorsement as you&#x27;ll ever see.Also I am happy to be your next choice after Kyle. I&#x27;ll join Stripe, Patrick! reply Rebuff5007 4 hours agoparentprev> But I hope they can maintain their Silicon Valley culture and not succumb to becoming a complete GM outpost.Silicon valley has not shipped a successful product in the space that Cruise is in, and its quite possible no company ever will, so maybe \"succumbing\" to a different culture could be a good thing. reply dmazzoni 5 hours agoparentprevHonestly everything about Cruise seemed awesome until they pushed to start offering driverless rides at the same time as Waymo, when obviously they weren&#x27;t as far along.Whose decision was that? I&#x27;m really curious if there were internal disagreements. reply Exoristos 4 hours agoparentprevNot Windows laptops! reply amacneil 4 hours agorootparentNot even kidding. They gave us a tour of their enterprise datacenter in Detroit and told us that cloud infrastructure was banned. At the time they had a plan to offer a complete in-house alternative to AWS. Meanwhile getting a single outbound port opened through their corporate firewall took several months. reply boulos 3 hours agorootparentPresumably you terrified them when you came to GCP :). reply patrick451 3 hours agoparentprevThis really seems like a rose colored glasses take. Kyle promoted a move fast and break things culture. When I have talked with Cruise engineers, many of them use that exact phrase, and they are proud of it. That culture ended up breaking a women&#x27;s face.This in particular> But I hope they can maintain their Silicon Valley culture and not succumb to becoming a complete GM outpost.is the last thing Cruise or the AV industry needs. SV culture is suitable for cranking out CRUD apps. SV has no business trying to produce safety critical software. reply kiratp 2 hours agorootparentBut the likes of GM do?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlantamagazine.com&#x2F;great-reads&#x2F;no-accident-insi...> it meant GM had produced a part that failed to meet not only its own internal minimums for torque but also basic federal safety standards. For all safety-related defects, NHTSA requires auto manufacturers and part suppliers to notify the agency within five business days after learning of a flaw that could lead to an accident. GM had not.> The documents showed that engineers first noticed the engine stalling problem way back in 2001, four years before Brooke purchased her Cobalt. What’s more, the Cobalt wasn’t the first GM car with a defective switch; that would be the 2003 Saturn Ion. Despite internal probes over the following decade that recommended changes to the key system, no changes were made. Indeed, GM appeared to double down on the bad ignition switch, integrating it into other compact cars, including the Chevy Cobalt, Chevy HHR, Pontiac Solstice, and Pontiac Pursuit.> As it turned out, DeGiorgio’s 2006 order came four years after an email he wrote to the ignition switch manufacturer, in which he ordered the company, rather than fix the part and incur delays, to “do nothing.” The email was signed “Ray (tired of the switch from hell) DeGiorgio.”> The report also described the disturbing pattern of disregard for the defect. This could be witnessed in gestures such as the “GM Nod”—in which GM employees affirmed the need for a plan of action, but understood no one actually intended on following through—and the “GM Salute,” described by one employee as the “crossing of the arms and pointing outward towards others, indicating the responsibility belongs to someone else, not me.” reply pierrefermat1 5 hours agoparentprevCould you speak to the unnecessary complexity a little more ? What were the design decisions to didn&#x27;t agree with ? reply xyst 6 hours agoparentprevIf Cruise is the amongst the “world leading AV technology”, we are truly f’d.As a person that had to deal with Cruise vehicles on the streets, they were by far the worst. reply 3seashells 2 hours agoparentprevThe tech is wasted on cars though, auto steering bikes, that&#x27;s were the future is. reply paul7986 4 hours agoparentprevReally loathed the tech bros attitude that Cruise came off I.e. trying to rapidly expand while their cars were totally not ready for prime time and showing such often in San Francisco. Trying to win the market at all costs like Uber tried which their irresponsible trying to kill it (win the market at all coss) behavior killed a pedestrian. I was afraid Cruise&#x27;s similar behavior (noted many times here on HN) would prompt something similar which it did but luckily and hopefully Cruise&#x27;s victim makes a full recovery.This is not technology to ever be created and or operated with those who are tech bro minded or following tech bro mantras(i.e. fake it til u make it)! Innocent people lives are put in danger if so as we&#x27;ve seen with Uber and now Cruise! reply sroussey 4 hours agorootparentYou mean the victim that got hit by a human driver that sent her flying in the air. And that human fled the scene. Hit and run. reply paul7986 4 hours agorootparentAnd then what happened after she was hit via a hit and run?She was hit and lodged underneath one of Cruises&#x27;s robot cars on training wheels who unlike what a human would do (stop the car & help the other human being) ..it&#x27;s algorithm (there&#x27;s no way these robot cars can account for all the million human scenarios that a human can) executed dragging the woman to the side of the road further mangling her body. reply modeless 3 hours agoprevCruise did exactly the wrong thing by folding under pressure and stopping all operations. Appeasing your critics simply doesn&#x27;t work. The appeasement alienates your supporters while doing nothing to change the minds of your critics as is amply demonstrated in this thread and elsewhere. Cruise&#x27;s cars were almost certainly not more dangerous than human driven cars. The CYA bureaucrats have taken over and there is no place for a founder at Cruise anymore.IMO Cruise&#x27;s fatal mistake was choosing San Francisco. It was hubris to think that they could change the minds of a populace and government clearly set on hating everything to do with tech. There are probably a bunch of cities that would be proud to host self-driving cars, rather than antagonistic. Things could have played out differently. reply dbt00 3 hours agoparentUber had huge supporters in Phoenix and that didn&#x27;t save them there. Cruise did the wrong thing by lying to government regulators. reply bobsomers 2 hours agorootparent> Cruise did the wrong thing by lying to government regulators.This is exactly the core problem. It wasn&#x27;t the crash. Regulators expect there to be problems with new technology, but they want to do deep investigations when they happen so everyone can learn from them. This could had been a great learning moment for Cruise, the regulators, the rest of the AV industry, and the general public.But then Cruise lied to the regulators, which is a HUGE no no. They don&#x27;t take kindly to industry trying to hide information like that. reply modeless 3 hours agorootparentprevUber folded too. They lost their founder before that happened and the whole self driving division was probably running on inertia. Clearly the new management wasn&#x27;t interested because they sold it soon after. reply throwawaynum2 7 hours agoprevThat&#x27;s too bad. I thought Kyle was a great CEO. I felt he really kept a positive, safety oriented, and accountability mindset. It&#x27;s hard to find CEOs these days that know the in&#x27;s and out&#x27;s of the product you&#x27;re making. Usually they&#x27;ll just slap someone on with an MBA that knows neither the HW nor SW, but since this was Kyle&#x27;s project from the beginning, he did. Coming from some other poorly managed startups, it was refreshing to work under both a technical and non-technical leader. Not sure what the future holds for us now. reply as-j 5 hours agoparentKyle was a fine CTO, and these are the qualities you listed.CEO is a different role, and without any checks in pace he’s pushed the organization so hard it is where it is today. Even the incident aside, just look at the handling and drip drip of news since going from bad to worse. reply ra7 7 hours agoprevTo the surprise of no one. This is on the back of GM appointing a Chief Administrative Officer to “work with” the CEO after their recent controversies. One unfortunate accident (though Cruise was at fault for making it worse) has put the entire company in disarray. I suppose it’s the result of accumulation of so many minor issues in San Francisco and a lack of a strict safety culture. It feels like a repeat of Uber from a few years ago that ended with shuttering of their self driving initiative. reply w10-1 6 hours agoparent> One unfortunate accidentI think it was covering up for the accident that caused regulators to pull the plug.If that were traced directly to the CEO, then he&#x27;s out for good reason.Otherwise, the CEO likely has to take the fall anyway to satisfy regulators who want consequences for executives who don&#x27;t ensure regulatory submissions are credible. reply ra7 6 hours agorootparentOh yeah, they’re definitely guilty of trying to cover it up.But I suspect Cruise was already on CA DMV’s bad books after having so many publicized issues in SF and this was just the last straw. reply SR2Z 4 hours agorootparentMany of the \"publicized\" issues in SF are entirely made up; see the \"Cruise blocks an ambulance\" incident, which SFFD had to recant as soon as Cruise started showing video to journalists.It&#x27;s a shame they tried to hide it in this situation. They could have had a relatively smooth rise if they hadn&#x27;t; a few years of awkward coexistence with robot cars is a small price to pay for the benefits of (almost totally) freeing humans from the task of driving.Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but a Cruise has still never avoidably struck a pedestrian. Even when there have been V2V crashes, the overwhelming majority were caused by poor driving from humans. reply catgary 3 hours agoparentprevYeah, maybe I’m a gatekeeper, but he just seems to fundamentally lack the credentials I would expect for the CTO of a self-driving car company. I know, startup culture, hackers, blah blah blah. But seriously - had he ever worked in the automobile industry? Shipped a major AI product? Dealt with safety-critical systems? reply Sebguer 5 hours agoprevWhy was the submission title changed from the much more descriptive actual article headline? I have no idea who Kyle Vogt is without the context of &#x27;co-founder and CEO&#x27;. reply dang 5 hours agoparentBecause readers can figure this kind of thing out. It&#x27;s not hard. reply tempestn 5 hours agorootparentBut why editorialize the title to make it less descriptive? I could understand not adding that information if it wasn&#x27;t there already, but it&#x27;s in the article title. reply snewman 5 hours agorootparentprevHelp me understand, what was gained by removing \"co-founder and CEO\"? The fact that readers can figure it out is not actually a statement of a benefit, it&#x27;s merely an argument that the loss is bounded. reply hirsin 3 hours agorootparentprevGiven all the random, ish, folks leaving openAI at the same time, understanding the context immediately is beneficial.

The big question is whether Cruise, trapped as it is between the inexorable demands of the capital it has taken on and the impenetrable difficulty of the remaining technical challenges of deploying their fleet commercially, has a path forward at all. \"Worth noting Cruise service paused (i.e. not even supervised rides) in Austin on Nov. 15: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1o1CTfsZy_k reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 2 hours agoprevActual title: Cruise co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt resigns reply gaucheries 3 hours agoprevThe TechCrunch article’s real title seems to be more descriptive: “Cruise-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt resigns” reply tsunamifury 7 hours agoprevI’m guessing cruise is pretty much over.What’s really unfortunate is I worked with many people who worked with Kyle and no one had a single good thing to say about him. And I’ve often heard that before with people who knew other CEOs but they kinda grudgingly admitted they did what was needed to get it done.However over and over I just heard phrases like “lost” “aimless” and “confused mess” with Kyle and it never was the “he’s an asshole but it makes the company work. It was just. He’s lost, distracted and constantly sidelined.I say all this because I actually feel for the guy. Because I know if I was CEO of a company going up against trillionare competitors I’d probably be the same way. Probably even worse. And that’s the state most CEOs are up against — completely unable no matter their skill to outmatch the largest monopolies the world has ever seen — who can simply outspend, outlast, and out do you with capital alone. reply eklitzke 6 hours agoparentI worked at Cruise (I left about 2.5 years ago) and I have the opposite impression about Kyle. Kyle was a very charismatic leader who was really in the trenches. Unlike a lot of CEOs he was really visible in the office, he would drop in on meetings if he had breaks in his calendar, he was active on Jira and Slack, etc. Even though I was just a rank-and-file engineer I was in a number of meetings with him and some of the engineers would meet with him often. It was pretty clear that he had his finger on the pulse of the company and understood what was going on in engineering in a pretty deep way.Some of these are qualities that I could see leading to someone thinking he was \"aimless\" or a \"confused mess\", but these are also things that engender a lot of respect from employees. For better or worse his presence was very much felt by engineers, and I think everyone thought that he was very technical.I think Kyle&#x27;s departure is going to hit hard for a lot of the engineers working on onboard software. It&#x27;s been reported that they are spending something like $250M&#x2F;quarter so in order to keep the ship afloat they are going to need to raise funding soon. It&#x27;s hard to think of a worse situation they could be fundraising in, which I assume is going to mean a massive down round, which is going to further dishearten the people working there. reply kbenson 6 hours agorootparent> Some of these are qualities that I could see leading to someone thinking he was \"aimless\" or a \"confused mess\", but these are also things that engender a lot of respect from employees.Respect from employees is a fickle thing. If someone can do all that you describe and still succeed as a CEO then power to them. When it comes time to choose between one or the other, I think most employees would rather an effective boss than one that seemed to understand them. Their opinion on the CEO might change rather quick were they to be laid off because the CEO just can&#x27;t cut it.It&#x27;s sort of like the cool parent that&#x27;s also a friend. If they can do that and effectively parent, they&#x27;re better at it than me. If it comes down to being a friend to your child or parenting them, one is nice and the other is a responsibility and has major repercussions when done wrong. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 3 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t keeping your finger on the pulse of the company an important part of the CEO&#x27;s job though? reply kyawzazaw 6 hours agorootparentprev> he would drop in on meetings if he had breaks in his calendarIs this a positive thing, tho? I am not sure. I am just curious. reply tsunamifury 6 hours agorootparentThis was referenced by several at the manager level as their specific complaint.

I have seen external people with a negative opinion of him but I am surprised to see someone say they have never seen anyone with a positive opinion, I saw far more positive than negative. reply tsunamifury 7 hours agorootparentThose who have left might be a bias sample (in my data) reply tempsy 7 hours agorootparentprevGlassdoor has a 66% approval rating for the company and ceonot exactly a stellar rating reply freddie_mercury 7 hours agorootparentBut there&#x27;s a lot of selection bias in that.

It’s low for a large company with as many ratings as it has. reply reducesuffering 6 hours agorootparentYes, this should not be discounted. Cruise has stunningly terrible reviews from verified employees. Based on my dataset from Blind, they were top 5% lowest ratings.

Successfully completing 250k autonomous rides is an extraordinarily achievement. Yes, there have been problems, but the issues that Cruise is facing today are a world away from the kinds of problems autonomous vehicles were facing even 5 years ago. The fact that there is one major incident being discussed and not a pile of bodies indicates just how close we are to what will undoubtedly be the largest transformation in transportation, and human productivity, in our lifetimes.

I&#x27;ll call you today with more details.\") the recruiter emailed me that Kyle wanted to talk. Since I&#x27;d already been offered the internship, I took it as a sell call to learn more about the company.But shortly thereafter when I emailed to accept the position, the recruiter responded> After your conversation with Kyle, we felt that we will need a more experienced intern for the projects we have. So, we are not going to pursue your application any further.At no point had I been told—until I tried to accept the offer—that it had been rescinded.Thankfully, I hadn&#x27;t yet reached out to the other companies who had given me offers and ended up at what turned out to be a much more successful startup. But if I had done it in the other order I would have been screwed.This was more than 12 years ago, and I still don&#x27;t know what happened internally. Having worked in many startups since then, I can understand the level of dysfunction that can occur even with well-intentioned leadership.But in any case, Kyle clearly didn&#x27;t care what happened to some random college student, and it&#x27;s left a bad taste in my mouth for all of these years. reply someonehere 6 hours agoparentprevI knew people who worked over there and didn’t have nice things to say about anyone in upper management.

Cruise ceased all operations in other states (particularly in TX).Their vehicles were by far the worst to deal with as both a pedestrian and driver. As a pedestrian, I have had more close calls with their vehicles compared to human drivers. They have caused unnecessary traffic jams (in Austin, TX there was an infamous incident in West Campus that took forever to clear). When their vehicles pulled over, they often did not pull over completely and thus becoming obstructions on the road. Cruise flooded the streets of DT austin at night to pump their mileage numbers as well. It was quite a common sight to see at least 2-3 cruise vehicles circling the same neighborhoods and even hogging all of the EV charging infrastructure.Good riddance. I say. reply minimaxir 7 hours agoprevThe situation at Cruise is so similar to OpenAI (political removal due to prioritizing success over safety) that the coincidental timing is almost contrived.At least in this case, Vogt is doing a clear resignation on his own terms. reply babl-yc 7 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t see the situations similar at all.Cruise is an extremely tough spot right now after its handling of the San Francisco accident, and it&#x27;s nationwide pause of testing.OpenAI has been extremely successful but is having strategic disagreements within its non-profit board. reply minimaxir 7 hours agorootparentGrowing-too-fast ended up being the root cause in both cases. reply ssnistfajen 4 hours agorootparentAdding the words \"integrity\" and \"honesty\" to the dictionary of many tech companies could do them a lot of good, really. reply kuchenbecker 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes you come to that conclusion? reply sillysaurusx 6 hours agorootparentprevIs this the SF accident you mean?

The initial impact was severe and launched the pedestrian directly in front of the AV. The AV then braked aggressively to minimize the impact. The driver of the other vehicle fled the scene, and at the request of the police the AV was kept in place.Why was cruise under fire for this? reply nemothekid 6 hours agorootparentWeird - this leaves out the most worrying part of the incident; the woman was pinned under the cruise vehicle and ended up being dragged under the vehicle as the vehicle started moving again.Furthermore, Cruise attempted to cover up the fact that the car dragged the woman.

Cars that are unsafe will literally kill people, which will then kill the program as seen with Uber.The AI safety&#x2F;success tradeoff seems far more nuanced. The threats are abstract, largely hypothetical, and safety seems to be directly in opposition with success. So it&#x27;s easy to see why product-oriented people would feel justified in making a call to ignore or down-prioritize safety, in a way that nobody running a self-driving car program can afford to. reply gumballindie 7 hours agoparentprevIn openai’s case it feels like perhaps safety is not the issue - a chatbot doesnt think and doesnt take over the world.

If you need a human to monitor to prevent a bad result, it doesn&#x27;t matter how often the human has to intervene.For example: With Tesla Autopilot, the driver doesn&#x27;t have to do anything the vast majority of the time. Still, your life expectancy will be measured in days if you don&#x27;t monitor it.Even if the vehicle makes completely random decisions when faced with a binary code, you could still say that 50% of the support events don&#x27;t result in the remote operator doing anything.Apocryphon 7 hours ago[flagged]| prevnext [3 more] AI winter?

    "originBody": "Why I Will Always Prefer to Work From Home October 25, 2023 Posted by Sysadmin I’ve been working from home since long before the pandemic. It’s been almost 10 years of partial ‘wfh’ and 6 years of full time ‘wfh’ for me, and frankly I don’t see it ever changing on my end, without threats of physical violence or bags of money. Some folks really missed the office social club when the shutdown happened, and I get that. But being a ‘tech person’ who needs to focus on things in a deep way, and having to share some open plan office space with a hundred other people every day… The two things just don’t mix well. In addition, being in the DevOps/SRE space means that I often need space to bang my head against the wall (figuratively of course) or yell out about the injustice of yet another bug in a Terraform provider that I don’t have the time to upgrade from. There’s just no way the tradeoff of going back to an office would work for me. Lets look at the two sides here from my perspective and see how it might compare to yours: The Office Noisy, tends to be either a ghost town or crowded, depending on the day. Some distance away, requiring anywhere from 30-90 minutes a day on average commute. You will never get this time back. Lets not talk about climate change, either. Vehicle and toll road costs can add up. In my area I would spend $200/mo on tolls just to drive to an office. Just when I am deep in some twisted train of thought involving a failing JS callback or missing network packets in Kubernetes someone ambles over to my cubicle to ask me some random question about helm that they could have answered in 2 seconds using the search function of their web browser. Train derailed. Ever have a bad boss that you are certain will be a later source of your soon to happen PTSD? Good luck getting away from this person at the office. The coffee. Honestly folks, don’t cheap out on the coffee at the office. Sometimes office coffee can be good, but after a round of budget cuts or layoffs it tends to end up as collateral damage. Child emergency? Parent in the hospital? It’s tough to deal with these at an office. If only there was a way you could just go somewhere else more convenient to get both things done without endangering your next promotion or performance review… WFH As noisy or quiet as I darn well want it to be. My cats may or may not be allowed to attend standup, depending on who is present that day If I feel like a nice cool Bernie 60 degrees or a sunny so-cal 78, I walk over to the temp control and make it so. Try that at the office and see what happens. My office at home is a dedicated space to my work. Once you add in the 4 monitors, personal artwork, extra large desk, soft couch, exercise equipment and drink fridge – it’s clear that I would have to be in the C suite to normally afford such luxury at ‘the office’. That 30-90 minutes of time wasted every day commuting to an office? I exercise, meditate, or do other important things that otherwise would be blocked by excuses or general end of day lethargy. If something breaks in prod – hey I’m right there to fix it anyway, without fuss, after hours if needed. Why would I take a sick day if I can still sit at my chair and work? No need to wear a mask during standup either, unless I catch some wild new zoom-transmitted virus. If I feel tired – hey look, there’s a nice couch right there and I can still get some work done. Management’s arguments against WFH: “Workers aren’t as productive at home” – Some workers. Probably the same workers who weren’t productive at the office either, but since there wasn’t anything in place to measure that anyway other than the ‘butt in seat’ metric, now they seem to be AWOL. If you can’t measure your employee’s productivity and hold them accountable to that outside of an office, then what are you managing? “People need to collaborate more to be innovative” – Don’t talk to me about collaboration when I sometimes have to turn off slack to be able to hear myself think. Yes I agree in principle that it may be easier to randomly chat about technical subjects walking around the office but in that case am I getting work done? Could I have just messaged someone instead and gotten the same answer, allowing them to respond when they had the mental bandwidth to do so? Brainstorming also works better from the couch, just saying. “People need to be in the office to be a part of the TEAM” – This may actually be somewhat true. I don’t feel as much a part of the company, the team when I work from my home office. I feel more like a lone agent, fulfilling my own need to have a work ethic and trying to do what ‘s right for our customers. Of course I’m on a team, but I wouldn’t be that upset if a new job showed up and I decided to take it. After all, my office doesn’t even change. I would probably miss the corporate culture of course, if I already like my job, but I certainly won’t feel guilty about getting a better job if I am unhappy. I suspect that many people who aren’t happy with their jobs stay with them out of a sense of attachment to the social nature of the office and the familiarity of the office workplace – and on some level, management knows this. This gets at a much deeper issue, however. Should we be loyal to companies who would lay us off at the drop of a hat to pad their quarterly earnings? Companies who decide the projects we work on have no merit but can’t be bothered to reassign us to more critical work after spending the time and money to get us in the door? Many of us feel the need to be loyal but what are we getting in return? In tech, you can also hurt your career if you stay with a legacy stack for too long, and your skillset no longer matches the needs of the marketplace. Don’t want to get caught out on the next round of layoffs without being good at some new technology? Better start looking now for a company willing to use your skillset to help them move to that new technology from the old one. When it comes time for a possible raise, how many companies still give them out, and when they do are they enough to mitigate the cost of living increases due to inflation? In a way, companies in today’s market by their behavior drive employees to look for other jobs to get a raise or improve their skillset. There is little investment in employees or their future beyond the HR skill training website and generally you are considered a ‘cog in the machine’ – I don’t think we should be loyal to that sort of setup or treatment. I don’t really know why or how things got this way, but if you work for a company that is not like this – consider yourself lucky. -AD- You may know that Namecheap does domain names, right?

For me, it&#x27;s as important as the others:Being an introvert, I always used to be exhausted at the end of the work week. I liked my coworkers a lot, and I liked spending time around them, but it didn&#x27;t matter, I&#x27;d still feel wrung out at the end of the day. And by the end of the week, each day&#x27;s exhaustion would have accumulated to the point where I needed two days spent doing absolutely nothing just to feel right again.Going for a weekend trip? Impossible, I barely want to shop for groceries. Hanging out with friends? Not going to happen, I talk to people all day at work. The weekend didn&#x27;t feel like a vacation, it felt like a time to catch my breath, and nothing more than that.Since WFH, I don&#x27;t run my batteries down during the week, and suddenly I have all this energy on Saturday and Sunday. I&#x27;ve taken up new hobbies, I visit places, I catch up with friends, I exercise, I go to restaurants. I&#x27;ve done more interesting stuff in the last 4 years than in the previous 10, because suddenly I have usable time and available energy. I thought I was a homebody, turns out I&#x27;m not. Imagine not finding that out for the first 20 years of your career! I&#x27;m not going back to the office, that&#x27;s for sure. reply neilv 13 hours agoparentSimilar here. I like being around other people to some degree, and it can be energizing in some ways, but it also uses energy.It also uses attention, and maybe engages different kinds of thinking, so I can&#x27;t focus as deeply on hard problems.One of my programming styles, for example, is \"meticulous zero-defect and resilient\", and when someone is in social proximity, it gets noticeably much harder, to impossible. I can do a routine UI design and coding when someone is right next to me, but even then, don&#x27;t expect me to flash on a brilliant insight into creative UI design or application opportunity -- only to do something that I don&#x27;t have to think about much.(This is also one of the many problems with Leetcode hazings&#x2F;shibboleths -- if you&#x27;re trying to think, rather than just instantiate the interview ritual you&#x27;ve memorized and practiced so much, that you can do it in your sleep.)(A related poor awareness of interviewers is that I&#x27;m pretty sure many don&#x27;t realize how much signal interviewers can pickup on intuitively, from language, voice, and body language. That note at the start of the syllable in the middle of innocuous-sounding sentence the Leetcode whip-cracker just said... can tell some interviewers quite a lot about what the person is really thinking, or can even be a concerning flag about their personality. Which can be very distracting when you&#x27;re thinking about an algorithm that suddenly doesn&#x27;t seem like the biggest problem at the moment. And if you have to also break your focused thinking to keep up a real-time expository narrative of your process for interview ritual purposes (which isn&#x27;t going to match actual cognition, so extra load)... careful not to start also narrating how you simultaneously need to figure out how to gently show them something they seem to misunderstand, without risking an insecure backlash when they do the interview writeup, because they&#x27;re coming across like that might be a risk.) reply negative_zero 15 hours agoparentprevSo much this^It&#x27;s an extroverts world and we&#x27;re all forced to conform to the \"extroverts narrative\".When all the extroverts were losing their minds because of COVID induced forced WFH, I frankly had no sympathy (and even a little sadistically felt a little glee). Didn&#x27;t like your work environment for just one or two years? Cry me a river little extrovert and try it for a whole life time. reply jes5199 16 hours agoparentprevI find Zoom so much more exhausting that being in the office, I am way more wiped out by my 2023 job than by my 2019 job reply goalieca 11 hours agorootparentI used to be more exhausted from 5-6 hours of in person meeting than 5-6 hours of camera off zoom meetings. Sometimes I do things like fold laundry or eat lunch during meetings where I dont need to talk and this gives me time to have an actual break later. reply Volundr 11 hours agorootparentOff camera meetings are great.

Nobody) reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 14 hours agorootparentWe do standup once a week and I think even that is too much. Our team is too big. There&#x27;s like 30 of us, we barely fit in even the large meeting rooms. No one listens to what anyone else has to say. I don&#x27;t know who the meeting is for. It&#x27;s not like any of us are even working on the same project. One person per project or you&#x27;ll never get promoted; even the managers admit that. reply janosdebugs 14 hours agoparentprevHear, hear. This is especially tricky since being an introvert doesn&#x27;t mean that one is completely unable to interact with people, just that it&#x27;s super draining. \"You an introvert? Impossible.\" - is a typical reaction. WFH is a massive quality of life improvement. reply fatih-erikli 4 hours agoparentprevMaybe you don&#x27;t need to talk to people all day at work if you could do your work without talking to them all day long during WFH. Work places must be quite, it&#x27;s not for chatting with others.If you are bored of office, you take a leave or you quit the work, problem solved.

Thanks for putting this into words, I have always felt the same way and just haven&#x27;t been able to be aware of it in a way that allowed it to come out verbally. reply the_snooze 17 hours agoprevI feel these discussions always go the same way. Working at an office sucks because of some combination of {long commute, open office plan, team not being there}. I quite like going to the office myself because my situation is the opposite: I bike to work, where I have my own office, and my team likes to come in too. Hating the office is totally justifiable given that my setup isn&#x27;t common; most people are forced to deal with crappy built environments. reply lowercased 17 hours agoparentI worked at a place years back that was expanding; bought a second building - 2 stories. Downstairs had semi-open cubicles, and a wall of private office spaces (8 IIRC). All empty. Cubes were full. I was in the other building, told we were needing to move over the next couple months. I asked for one of the private spaces. They weren&#x27;t really that big, and had no natural light, but... they did have a door. I&#x27;d been wrestling with being in an open cube next to marketing people (trying to juggle multiple dev projects), and routinely had 3-5 people on the phone around me. Very distracting.\"Nope, those offices are for managers\".\"But... they&#x27;re empty now\".\"We&#x27;re putting together the budget for next year to hire more managers\".\"So... those will sit empty for the next 6-9 months and I have to work in an open cube environment, being distracted by the growing number of people around me\".\"Looks that way, but don&#x27;t be so negative about it. I think we&#x27;re done here. Close my door on your way out please\".I left a few weeks after that exchange. reply rootusrootus 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t even need a private office. One of the best environments I&#x27;ve ever worked in was a hybrid office&#x2F;open model. Basically a bunch of conference rooms where each team got a room, and within the room the desk walls were low. Decorate it however you want, if you agree on style then you can have ambient music, etc. It was pretty great.But then they knocked all the walls down and put in rows of desks because they could cram more people in that way. Within a year probably 25% of our development staff walked. reply devnullbrain 16 hours agorootparentPost-covid WFH discussions have led to a collective amnesia about this. We also spent buckets of time complaining about offices before it because almost every employer made decision like yours. Most offices were terrible places to work and non-technical managers ignored common sense and science to cram as many people as possible into their existing real estate costs. We&#x27;d gone from yearning for personal rooms from our cubicles to yearning for cubicles from our loud open-plan spaces. reply wkat4242 15 hours agorootparentYes I remember I had an office in a major office building in Amsterdam.. as an intern.Shortly after the open plan craze started. And now there&#x27;s the hotdesking nightmare. I feel much less valued and respected every time. reply lowercased 17 hours agorootparentprevWorked in a place like that - mostly open cube space for around 80 inbound call agents, and a few &#x27;side rooms&#x27;. Worked with 5 other dev&#x2F;tech folks in one of those &#x27;side rooms&#x27; - a suitably sized office for the 6 of us.It was reasonable, in that we were generally all quiet or talking at the same time, and was not the worst place at all I&#x27;ve worked. Dedicated private space still works best for a lot of type of work (obviously that&#x27;s \"imo\" but seems a standard POV from most colleagues today). reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentprevPeople here talk a lot about being able to have closing doors. My experience with private offices was, barring confidential conversations or rarely going really heads down for a few hours, the unwritten policy was you kept your door open. I&#x27;ve never worked anyplace where private offices generally had their doors shut. reply cereal_cable 3 hours agorootparentAgreed, but having a door meant you could put the \"do not disturb\" sign up. Of course that&#x27;s pretty specific to your companies culture, but if someone closed their door at my office, I&#x27;d stroll around later.One of the biggest benefits of course is that you have a lot less sound travel. Doors open and you&#x27;ll still be able to have a neighbor that has an open door meeting, phone call, etc and it won&#x27;t interrupt you.After moving from a private office with a door to a team space, I missed it severely. Now I&#x27;m WFH and when my kids aren&#x27;t home generally my door stays open. reply watwut 14 hours agorootparentprevIt may be cultural, but in here offices are usually closed. It is kind of \"weird\" to see them with open doors. reply lowercased 13 hours agorootparentWhen I have work I&#x27;m focusing on, I close the door. When I&#x27;m OK with being interrupted (work or casual), I leave the door open. reply ghaff 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t have a large sample size but across multiple companies in both New Orleans and New England, closed doors sort of meant: \"I have a specific reason not to be disturbed.\" Which didn&#x27;t include I just prefer to be in \"flow\" or whatever. The situation is probably different if you&#x27;re on a busy public corridor as can be the case in universities, etc. reply ipython 14 hours agorootparentprev“Sure, here’s your office - cell #510J”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;AMP&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;aws_prison_office... reply morelisp 16 hours agorootparentprevOne side-effect of the WFH period for us (and I assume a number of other EU companies) is that once we went WFH, we also went remote; previously we had two offices and everyone worked in one of those two cities and today we have (IIRC) five and people work all over the country and take rail into the nearest office when necessary.This has... mostly worked out OK. In any given office there&#x27;s some spaces dedicated for the people who work there regularly, at least a room or two with a half dozen seats for hotdesking, but then - three dedicated, closed-door single-person offices exclusively for the executives, who of course never show up outside their home office (if even there). reply soneil 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been seeing. My team were all in one corner of one room. Then \"one day\", we were all sent home.Someone left, and was replaced by someone in another European country. He&#x27;s nominally \"in the office\", but since it&#x27;s not the same office as the rest of us (and we&#x27;re not in ours anyway), he&#x27;s free to come and go as he pleases. It&#x27;s not like it makes any difference to us.Then our manager moved on, and was replaced by someone in yet another European country. He was WFH &#x2F; fully remote before \"this\" even started.By time they tried to sell us on RTO, exactly 50% of the team are still here. And going to the office now, just makes it less convenient to call the other 50% of my team. (Yes, call. Call me old fashioned, but I love a good bitchfest, and a good bitchfest shouldn&#x27;t be in writing.) My manager genuinely advised we ignore the RTO missive and see what happens. (Spoiler: not much.)Then my boss&#x27;s boss moved on, and was replaced by another remote position - and now the murmurs of RTO have died down.Now we&#x27;re hiring and the net has widened yet again. They need to be in a country where we have a legal presence, and need to be willing to work European hours.It&#x27;s amazing how much has changed in relatively little time. It doesn&#x27;t feel like that long ago I was trying to make the case for WFH on weekends. reply ghaff 15 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s the situation at many places. They&#x27;ve had three years of hiring and organizational changes where, by and large, they didn&#x27;t really pay a lot of attention outside of gross timezone or language factors to where people physically lived. So now they&#x27;re in a place where they really can&#x27;t just undo those three years and move back to teams being mostly colocated. At least without a lot of organizational turmoil and at least some cost. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 14 hours agorootparentprevPeople evidently were ignoring the rto mandate at my company too.

Or want their pet around. Or don&#x27;t want to wear makeup and get out of the house at all. Those who squat during the long meetings. Those who usually need an hearing aid but can instead just push the sound up if they&#x27;re at home etc.Sure, any of those could be addressed in an office setting, but you still only have one office for hundreds of people who probably wish for different things.

Recently I changed employers, to a place down the street, and I loved going to the office before RTO (we&#x27;re expected to be in the office 3 days a week). Most of the team voluntarily came in every Tuesday and Thursday. We had a lot of fun. Then RTO came, and it seemed to coincidence with every other large employer in the area forcing RTO, and most of the things that were great about it evaporated overnight.Now the campus is crowded and noisy. Parking is annoying. The lines in the cafeteria and nearby restaurants are insane and simply not worth the wait or frustration of trying to coordinate timing. There&#x27;s a lot of small battles being fought about temperature control, lighting in the office, etc. ~Half the team is still geographically remote to our main campus, at smaller satellites across the country or they have long term full-time remote arrangements. So we&#x27;re on Zoom regardless. And I still between someone on my team and someone on an adjacent team, and frequently find myself sitting in between them while they&#x27;re on separate calls. Even with headphones on, it is fucking madness.It&#x27;s just annoying again, and needlessly frustrating, and reminds me of why I originally sought out full time remote back in 2011. reply cereal_cable 2 hours agorootparentI love the mandates to RTO to only get onto Zoom or Teams meetings with people in multiple timezones and offices all traveling to the office to fulfill the RTO mandate and yet...the only thing that changed was the blurred backdrop. reply ravetcofx 16 hours agoparentprevSo maybe many people just really hate car dependency and long commutes which should push us to move away from such a model of urban planning.

I would need to have a specific reason to do that and no one I work with regularly is in that office.

Granted I know multiple people who had WFH jobs where the carpet was swept right out from under them and they had to start coming into the office or be laid off, which is the flipside to my argument, though it doesn&#x27;t really affect me because my company has no central headquarters so some huge internal changes would need to happen for my situation to change.Anyway, biking to work is awesome, that&#x27;s a cool setup too for sure.

I can put on clothes, do the dishes, cleaning, or whatever. It&#x27;s amazing how much you can do, by just spending 10-15 mins here and there throughout the week.My weekends do feel a bit longer, since there&#x27;s less housework to be done.I spend less money on fuel, and shop less.Of course, I do enjoy hanging out and talking with my colleagues - but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m \"missing out\" if I&#x27;m at the office 1-3 days a week, compared to 5 days a week.So, mostly just benefits for my part.

People got their socializing not from people who were paid to sit in the same room together, but from people who came to a cafe or restaurant or pub to sit in the same room together.If your commute is close to an office it’s also close to a communal space. Instead of doing chores at home during lunch, why not leave your home and your job and be with the people you live around? The people who share your neighborhood are more a feature of your life than the people who share your payroll, in so far as they exist in the same context as you for longer - if you let them.I actually find it sad we’ve lost our communities and traded them for our workplace cliques. We huddle in our break rooms and exchange banalities and assume this is in fact a bond we are forming. We all then commute home to our real life and the two don’t cross over.But life isn’t actually split into two realities, it’s all one thing. We just insulate our valued life over our work life, trying to make a balance between our sacrifice and our existence. This is a new phenomenon in human existence, and I don’t think it’s strictly necessary. And I suspect it’s not healthy.But why does it feel so lonely to work from home? Because we don’t have the skills, mental framework, or neighborhood infrastructure any more to build social connection outside of the artificial community of the office. reply lostlogin 16 hours agoparentprevCommutes can be amazing.

They can afford to, unlike most employees.If you want RTO build more dense housing near where offices are located. And build solid transit and other means of getting to an office quickly. reply woodruffw 17 hours agoprevThe underlying thing here, like in so many cases, is coercion: we should structure workplaces and workforces to treat people well (and optimize for their long-term productivity), rather than squeezing them for short-term outcomes.Whether that means working from home or an office depends on the person, but the corporate policy is the same regardless: let people work where they do their best work. reply angarg12 14 hours agoprevHere is an argument in favor of WFH that I hardly ever see:Growing up in a second rate city in a country with little tech scene, my and my colleague options to advance our career was to leave our city or our country behind. Having to choose between family&#x2F;friends and career is a pretty tough choice to face. My sister in law moved to the capital for 2 years and had a distance relationship until she was able to transfer back to our city.WFH makes this much less of an issue. Now someone can have a successful career more easily even if they live in a small town. Having more choice of career while not sacrificing friends and family is something I wish I had 15 years ago.At the same time people starting their career tend to be the ones who benefit the most from an office setup, so there is probably still a tradeoff to make. reply isanengineer 16 hours agoprevAs a mechanical engineer, I want to offer some perspective on how specific this is for people working exclusively in software. I would never ever even consider working fully remotely, mainly because my job involves designing physical things. The prototypes and models for them are not and cannot be in my home. A big part of my job involves making sure the technician can actually assemble the things I design, which requires going to the place where they assemble it. My company employs many software engineers, and they work from home more frequently than the mechanical or electrical engineers, but they are much more hesitant to allowing full remote just because the work is so centered on the physical product. Every time I see an article posted here arguing one way or the other this rarely comes up. Regardless of the pros, cons, or preferences this just is not an option for a lot of technical people. reply lolinder 16 hours agoparentThis is fair, but I think software engineering is more typical of most knowledge work in this respect than mechanical engineering is. Most knowledge workers aren&#x27;t handling physical objects for their work beyond a keyboard, mouse, and possibly a high-quality headset.Software is probably rare among engineering disciplines in never requiring physical access to specialized equipment, but it&#x27;s pretty normal in the scope of white-collar work in general. reply OJFord 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not so sure about that, scientists need labs, academics have labs and lecture theatres, lawyers (some of the time) need courts and to meet clients or counterparties, very few doctors can work from home a non-trivial amount, etc.I agree it&#x27;s unusual for something we call engineering, but I don&#x27;t think needing more than a computer is that unusual for &#x27;knowledge work&#x27;. A lot of finance has been more changed by computers than professions like accounting say which you could roughly say just swapped paper for computers and always could&#x27;ve been done from home to a similar extent.

They sucked at remote work and if you were not in the office you were not seen.My first Junior job was in a remote-first company and it was an absolute non issue and I don&#x27;t think being in office would have helped in any form.The difference is, with remote work you need to have processes in place. You can&#x27;t just stuff people in an office and hope for the best. You need a mentoring program. You need to encourage pair programming. You need to build digital spaces where socialization can happen and people can just hang out.> people who just cannot wfh effectivelyYeah but don&#x27;t forget that for many people with special needs, WFH can be a huge blessing and allow them to work in the first place.And yes, some people thrive more in a hybrid environment.

But that doesn&#x27;t mean that what you change into is actually more difficult.Also, I&#x27;m not sure of newer generations where you&#x27;re from, but here what I see is less and less want from people to have in-person conversations. Newer generations have everything done remotely. Ordering food, socializing (online video games, etc), that in-person conversations often are intimating to them. Which begs the question, have the people who say juniors need in-person help actually asked juniors what they would like? Or is it more that _you_ are more comfortable _teaching_ in-person, in which case again, the problem seems to be you, not the juniors.All-in-all, I&#x27;m just not seeing the difficulties people seem to say they have. Just my $0.02. reply oHqgTQUT 16 hours agorootparentThe single biggest issue I&#x27;ve noticed is that body language communicates a lot, and in remote environments you cannot see this.

Can you repeat it?\"As another example, I&#x27;ve worked with some people who are quite confrontational and dare I say, aggressive, on camera, and have raised their voice a couple of times in the past.

There&#x27;s also a selfish component: if I don&#x27;t help the new people get up to speed and improve, then I will be less confident delegating tasks.IMHO, there is sufficient motivation for senior developers to work with the junior members of the team that are unrelated to physical space. reply alemanek 17 hours agoparentprevFor the team I am on maintaining virtual office hours has really helped in this respect.

Just a couple of thoughts on this part:> being a ‘tech person’ who needs to focus on things in a deep way, and having to share some open plan office space with a hundred other people every day… The two things just don’t mix well.I’ve totally argued this myself in the past. Long before the pandemic I even tried having office hours, and hanging ‘don’t talk to me right now’ signs on my char (with limited success at best). But for most software engineering I now disagree with the ‘I need deep focus’ arguments. I have watched way too many people go off and write the wrong software when left to their own devices, me included, claiming they needed space for deep thinking. Over-engineering is a widespread problem and a massive waste of time and energy, and a lot of people are better off with frequent check-ins and budgets on their alone time. Everyone hates having budgets and micromanagement too, of course, and it’s possible and common to go overboard on that in the wrong direction. It just needs to be balanced, but on the whole this is one of the reasons that being in the office sometimes is useful.Another good reason is that co-workers need help, information needs to flow, and allowing knowledgeable people to avoid all interruptions is bad for the productivity of team. I have also seen many of the best engineers write large systems and get them deployed widely, with not enough documentation, and then make themselves unavailable and act like questions are too burdensome on their time, saying they require deep-focus time for whatever they’re working on. reply mattlondon 15 hours agoparent+1 to this. I feel like a lot of the time the \"focus time\" blocks in their calendar are just because they can&#x27;t be bothered to deal with meetings or talking to others - basically they just want to do the parts of the job they like (code or whatever) and to fuck with the bits they don&#x27;t like. \"Sorry - can&#x27;t do that planning&#x2F;bug triage&#x2F;training&#x2F;mentoring&#x2F;interview session - I am in my focus time\"When you get to the more accomplished&#x2F;senior levels of impact, it is all about scaling your skills - i.e. using your skills and knowledge to accomplish more than just one person can do on their own by sharing knowledge, helping others etc, leading a team&#x2F;teams in the right direction and so on.Locking yourself away so noone can talk to you for hours&#x2F;days at a time are the hallmarks of a selfish engineer (or at the least a very junior one who doesn&#x27;t yet realise their place) reply just_boost_it 14 hours agoprevI have a 100% remote job, but I had them set me up with a desk in a coworking space. I just felt that being alone all day was just a lonely way to live my life. It was great at the start to have so few interruptions, but y&#x27;know we&#x27;re not building the pyramids. Everything we make in tech becomes legacy pretty quickly and eventually forgotten about and lost. I think a lot of life is what happens in the interruptions. That&#x27;s where you find out about the guy that goes ice fishing and get invited along, or about someone who plays in a band and introduces you to a weird new music scene or something like that. I think everyone should get to work however they feel they need to within reason (I like the coworking space vibe myself), but I just hope people aren&#x27;t giving up more than they realised. reply wood_spirit 17 hours agoprevCan we have a quick roundup on where each of the faangs and household names are on going back to the office?Can report that Spotify is firmly work-from-anywhere and wouldn’t have place for everyone if they went back on that. People sometimes work from exotic locations and it’s normal to not having met teammates in person etc. Productivity is generally high and not adversely affected. reply LRVNHQ 14 hours agoprevI much prefer working at the office.There&#x27;s less distraction and better divide between work and private time. When I leave the office, I&#x27;m done for the day.I find somewhat ironic that people use an alleged higher productivity at home as justification for remote work, but but doing chores around the house throughout the day always comes up as a perk of WFH. Doing chores and being productive are antithetic.Anecdotically I live in Europe and don&#x27;t know anybody of any age who wants to work 100% remote, although obviously everybody likes the flexibility of working ~50% remote. Hating the office to the point of wanting to be 100% remote seems to be a very american thing, I wonder why. Average commute time the the US is among the shortest in the OECD btw, so the reason must lie elsewhere. reply tikhonj 14 hours agoparent> Doing chores and being productive are antithetic.Creative, high-leverage work like programming isn&#x27;t a linear function of hours-in-chair. If working from home lets you focus better and be more creative, you can absolutely be both more productive and have time to do chores&#x2F;etc. reply glow8 14 hours agoparentprevI personally really enjoy my commute. It does take 25 minutes, but I cycle, enjoying the views of parks and multiple gorgeous monuments. It makes me move a bit, as opposed to my usual very very sedentary days when I wfh. I imagine this isn&#x27;t as frequent in the US, as I live in Germany.I have actually moved to a team that doesn&#x27;t do wfh so much anymore because my days were long and boring.

Not only working from home comes naturally for me but I have to say that since I started WFH 15 years ago, I&#x27;ve been a top performer in most of the teams I worked for (and that includes some teams where I was the only remote worker). I don&#x27;t see any reason why I should work from an office at this point in my career and it actually makes little sense to me why some companies are losing top performers just to enforce some silly back to the office rules. I guess they just promoted the wrong people :) reply donbox 17 hours agoprevDoes your team use Slack (or something similar). Don&#x27;t you get random pings, mentions or calls for help&#x2F;input. Is there an expectation around for you to respond within a short period. I have been 100% WFH since last 5 years and I am only productive after 5 pm. reply Jcampuzano2 16 hours agoparentMy team does use Slack, but I just have it muted for most channels and check it in predefined intervals. I don&#x27;t have DM&#x27;s muted but we also don&#x27;t have a culture of DM&#x27;ing people, calls for help are posted in designated channels.In my opinion and experience there are very few issues that require you to actually respond immediately, I just find many teams don&#x27;t understand this. Everyone thinks their specific issue is the highest priority thing going on, and I&#x27;d say product teams are especially bad about this. Asking for status updates all too often and interrupting developers days just for small things that could&#x27;ve been done at a scheduled time or just been an email.Obviously this can somewhat depend on your role since your role may be something that tends to require immediate intervention. But I check Slack once every 30 min to an 1 hour or so and have no issues with my response times. reply wood_spirit 17 hours agoparentprevYes a big downside from wfh is that you don’t need to book a meeting room :(This means people can book meetings when people are free instead of being limited by the availability and preplanning of big enough rooms! reply codingdave 17 hours agoparentprevYou can ignore those random pings of all kinds until you at a good place to stop what you are doing and help out. If you are responding to all of those the second they come in, you are encouraging the problem by building a culture of over-responsiveness.I&#x27;ve been on teams where we explicitly defined expected response times. 2 hours was the typical answer on teams where I&#x27;ve worked.I&#x27;ve also been on teams that didn&#x27;t define the expectation, but nobody I work with expects Slack to be real-time. The only time we respond quickly is when we have first asked, \"Hey, let me know when you have a couple minutes to chat.\" And then I either stick around until they have time and quickly have the chat&#x2F;huddle... or if they don&#x27;t respond and I need to step away, I delete my message.It sounds counter-intuitive but you can often build a better remote culture by being a little less responsive. reply bilalmaleq 17 hours agoprevDon&#x27;t you guys think that WHF makes learning for Junior Devs relatively much more difficult? reply devnullbrain 16 hours agoparentWhen I was a junior my manager was in a different country.

To separate my workspace from my living space, I rented a co-working station similar to WeWork, which is a 10-15 minute walk from my home. I usually spend 4-5 hours a day there, focusing on tasks like hard problems, and work from anywhere for less demanding tasks, like squashing bugs. On a weekly basis, I find myself spending more productive hours this way than I would if I were going to an office. Additionally, this approach allows me to learn more; I can freely explore new frameworks or technologies unrelated to my current work, without the pressure of product deadlines breathing down my neck. reply atleastoptimal 17 hours agoprevI enjoy working from the office when the atmosphere of the office is aligned and there aren&#x27;t a hundred abstractions of self justification and internal status signaling, though that&#x27;s very rare in most companies. reply cwales95 17 hours agoprevI liked this post.

This new lab, called Kyutai, will be a privately funded nonprofit working on artificial general intelligence. It will work with PhD students, postdocs and researchers on research papers and open source projects. When Iliad originally unveiled this research lab, the firm said that Niel was committing €100 million to this project ($109 million at today’s exchange rate). “Thanks to some amazing friends who are there today, now we are close to €300 million for the financing of this initiative,” Niel said at the conference. Among those “friends” is another French billionaire, Rodolphe Saadé, the CEO of French shipping and logistics giant CMA CGM, who is putting €100 million too. There are other smaller contributors, such as Eric Schmidt’s foundation and some unnamed donators. This is just a starting point, as Kyutai is open to more donations. “What’s interesting with so many journalists in the room is that the project will potentially interest other investors,” Saadé said at a press conference after the announcement. As Kyutai will work on foundational models, they will also need some compute power. The good news is that Scaleway, the cloud division of Iliad, recently acquired a thousand Nvidia H100 GPUs. These top-of-the-line GPUs are essential for inference and model training and will be available at cost for Kyutai. Kyutai has already started hiring for its core scientific team. Six men took the stage this morning to talk about their previous work and what they have in mind for the research lab — Patrick Perez, Edouard Grave, Hervé Jegou, Laurent Mazaré, Neil Zeghidour and Alexandre Defossez. They previously worked for Meta’s AI research team FAIR, Google’s DeepMind division, Inria, etc. Patrick Perez, who previously worked for Valeo, is going to be the director of the research lab. Kyutai has also put together a team of scientific advisors who are well-known AI researchers — Yejin Choi, Yann LeCun and Bernhard Schölkopf. They will just check everyone’s work once or twice a year and give feedback. One of the reasons Kyutai thinks it can convince some researchers to join its lab is that researchers will be able to publish research papers. “Unfortunately, big tech companies tolerate scientific publications less and less. Beyond the ego boost for researchers, it helps to advance research and contribute to the common good,” Niel said during the press conference. Of course, this isn’t the first open AI research lab. OpenAI, as the name still indicates, started as a nonprofit. But things changed drastically after Sam Altman started working full time on OpenAI in 2019. OpenAI moved to a more traditional corporate structure and raised funding from Microsoft. Other companies have also been working on open source foundational models, such as Meta with its Llama model and Mistral AI. Kyutai’s models will be open source too, but the researchers describe their work as open science. They plan to release open source models, but also the training source code and data that explain how they released these models. “When it comes to the timeline, I don’t think our aim is necessarily to go as fast as Mistral, because our ambition is to provide a scientific purpose, an understanding and a code base to explain the results,” Defossez said at the press conference. But they expect to have something to share within a year. Mazaré, another researcher from Kyutai’s team, still described Mistral AI’s first open source model as a success because many community members have been fine-tuning it and exploring use cases based on the Mistral 7B model. It’s also going to be interesting to see if a research lab is more efficient at releasing foundational models compared to private companies, and how private companies are going to leverage Kyutai’s work for commercial applications. Image Credits: Romain Dillet / TechCrunch “I’m also a strong believer in open source, and we need to turn it into a French asset,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a prerecorded video message at the conference. France’s position: Regulating use cases, not models Macron also used this opportunity to define and defend France’s position on Europe’s AI Act, saying that use cases should be regulated, not model makers. France has been pushing to water down the AI Act in trilogues (a trilogue is a negotiation between Europe’s three main instances, the Parliament, the Commission and the Council). “Regulation is not the enemy of innovation, quite the contrary. It’s not a question of defining good models, but we need to ensure that the services made available to our citizens are safe for them, for other economic players and for our democracy,” Macron said. “With work on the European regulation for artificial intelligence currently in ‘trilogues,’ regulation must be controlled and not punitive, to preserve innovation and regulate usage rather than technology as such,” he added. Niel basically sided with France’s position on this topic during the press conference. According to him, Europe is lagging behind when it comes to AI innovation, and regulation will slow down European newcomers and diminish the chances of them catching up. “For the time being we’re more in the innovation part than the regulation part. Creating regulation means it creates barriers to competitors,” Niel said. Maybe if French AI companies become massively successful, things could change. “I’d love it if one day we could talk about French imperialism in AI,” Niel added later in the conversation.

The ones muddying the waters are people and companies releasing source code with a proprietary licence while trying to latch onto the open source branding. reply yieldcrv 21 hours agorootparentprevthe “and” in FOSS is actually doing alot of heavy lifting, as open source really does only mean source availableyes, I want FOSS too reply Lapha 14 hours agorootparent>as open source really does only mean source availableThe definition and history of the term as a licence is unambiguous in that the only restriction on redistribution is that it contains the source code under the same licence. There are senior engineers alive today that weren&#x27;t even born when this was the commonly understood meaning of the term, it&#x27;s not a new concept.The term and usage is being co-opted these days but that&#x27;s bound to happen when it&#x27;s not a legally protected definition. Give it another 10-20 years and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be having the same argument over whatever term ends up replacing &#x27;open source&#x27;. reply yieldcrv 14 hours agorootparentI’m all for “language evolving”Language exists to convey a shared conceptIn this case, the evolved version of open source fails to convey a shared concept in comparison to the prior term, “free and open source software” or FOSS for a shorthand adjectiveHere, people with knowledge of the lexicon are using it accurately, and people without knowledge of the lexicon or its etymology are complaining when they should be pushing for FOSS instead of getting surprised everytime reply babyeater9000 19 hours agorootparentprevI just want free software. The oss is redundant to me. reply ben_w 19 hours agorootparentThe open source[0] is the only reason anyone has time to make most of the valuable free software.We can&#x27;t all be like Donald Knuth or Simon Tatham making TeX and PuTTY as personal projects.[0] specifically the freedom to fork, to develop further, and to make new releases that others can also build upon, which means I aver that many of the public AI models are sufficiently open that they&#x27;re de facto open source even if the licensing isn&#x27;t there.Even if it&#x27;s a de jure violation of the copyright to make a derivative, I&#x27;m not sure you could prove that had happened when all the weights are floating point numbers you can randomise slightly as a first step — if training just happens to move them back to the original values, well, that&#x27;s just evidence the optimiser was working. reply gentleman11 18 hours agorootparentprevMoney is important to find ventures, but the open source aspect is important for guaranteeing user freedom in the long run in our society reply gchamonlive 19 hours agorootparentprevWhy is it redundant? Redundant to what? What would account for what opensource brings without opensource itself? reply babyeater9000 17 hours agorootparentYou have free software. Free software is pretty rigidly defined. You also have open source software, which people also seem to think is defined. I&#x27;m my opinion, the concept of open source software is vague enough that its definition is open to interpretation. Look at the people claiming that source available software is open source. Source available software is, in fact, open source software, even if it&#x27;s not compatible with copyleft. Free software is not open to interpretation. Open source software can be free software, but some software can rightfully be called open source software even if it isn&#x27;t free software. So, if we are using the terms interchangeably because they are the same thing, then open source is a redundant term. If open source software and free software are not the same, which might be the case sometimes, then I want free software. I&#x27;m not a programmer. I don&#x27;t care to make money from software and, frankly, I don&#x27;t care about the money making aspect of software. Open source stuff, to me, reeks of corporate capture. I don&#x27;t want telemetry, or to be bled financially to use a product. I don&#x27;t believe that software is or can ever be a product. Algorithms shouldn&#x27;t be copyrighted even if they are wrapped in a programming language. I don&#x27;t care about implementation. I think this is a case of A is B and B is sometimes A. It&#x27;s the sometimes case that really bothers me. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point.... reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t believe that software is or can ever be a productYou must mean should be, since we have decades of evidence to the contrary. reply babyeater9000 15 hours agorootparentI mean that software, in it&#x27;s written form, is the documentation of knowledge from software development, a service. I view sciencing as another service that produces knowledge. Knowledge has zero cost of duplication and, as such, cannot be considered a product. Artifacts that are produced by the application of knowledge are products because they have a non-zero cost of duplication. Computer hardware is an example of a product. I don&#x27;t view intellectual property as property either. Software, in my opinion, isn&#x27;t a product. Software is knowledge. I don&#x27;t claim to be correct. I&#x27;m attempting to share my point of view. Anything with zero cost of duplication isn&#x27;t a product in my mind because these things are infinitely copyable once created. Once a mathematician discovers a math they don&#x27;t retain rights to it. Charging money for software is, in my view, no different than trying to make people pay for secret knowledge. You might be able to keep the secret locked down for a while, but it will get out eventually. Knowledge is the closest thing we have to magic, and if we choose to view it through the zero sum lens of capitalism, I think that does society a disservice in the long run. If I were a wizard I would share the magic, not try to charge money to teach people a spell or two. It might be the case that all products are knowledge given form, but keep in mind that knowledge exists before and after discovery and its fruits&#x2F;artifacts must be created with work. reply thinkmassive 19 hours agorootparentprevFree Software is inherently open source reply meiraleal 16 hours agorootparentYes.

In fact it&#x27;s a problem since you might open yourself up to trouble just by reading it. reply Obscurity4340 18 hours agorootparentprevCan you provide a small snippet of what is meant by \"weights\", I assume that refers to some probabillistic ratios or something? reply IanCal 17 hours agorootparentThe weights refers to the trained model.Lots of neural nets are pretty standard, and work by multiplying lots of numbers by other ones. The key is to figure out which numbers to use. Those are the weights of each connection between the artificial neurons in the model.With them you can run the model yourself. reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;deeplizard.com&#x2F;lesson&#x2F;ddd2drizla reply gumballindie 20 hours agoparentprevIf it’s out there then it’s fair use isnt it?

Also given that French research is underfunded since decades, our researchers are accustomed to producing good results at a budget cost. reply umanwizard 18 hours agorootparent“French research is underfunded since decades” is a French-ism, just so you know. Normally native English speakers would say “French research has been underfunded for decades”. reply trealira 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve noticed a lot of comments on Hacker News that use this construction. I don&#x27;t point it out because often people dislike unsolicited advice about their English.Spanish speakers also make this mistake. I haven&#x27;t met German speakers, but they also say the equivalent of \"is (adjective) since (time)\" in German. It makes me wonder if English is just unusually strict about this distinction compared to other European languages. reply vunderba 16 hours agorootparentI am also not a huge fan of unsolicited grammatical advice, because I feel like it&#x27;s both low effort and derails the conversation. If the grammar error is more syntactical in nature and doesn&#x27;t obscure the meaning of the thoughts intended to be conveyed, then let&#x27;s just all move on.This is an international forum, we&#x27;re well accustomed to being able to parse meaning despite a few inconsequential grammatical issues. reply umanwizard 15 hours agorootparentI pointed it out because when I lived in France, I personally appreciated people pointing out grammatical mistakes I made in French. If the OP doesn’t care about sounding more like a native English speaker, that’s perfectly fine and he can just ignore my comment. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentprevPeople can just not engage in conversations they don’t like. This forum has a branching structure, it is easy to hide a topic that you don’t like.If someone was to be really odious and hateful, the presence of that sort of thing could be harmful, but this seems like a polite correction of a common problem. And it is an international forum, there are plenty of people who might get something from language-chat. reply lucubratory 12 hours agorootparentprevAs someone learning a language that&#x27;s not my native one, people who correct my Chinese kindly are the absolute gold standard. People who correct it rudely are rare but still more helpful than people who say nothing and just move on. This is very common in language learning communities. My default assumption is that other people who are learning a language that I know natively probably feel similar, and would appreciate kind, contextual corrections. I am happy to adjust if someone lets me know they don&#x27;t want that or if it&#x27;s against the rules of a specific forum. reply umanwizard 15 hours agorootparentprevI think most European languages lack the distinction between “he did X” and “he has done X”. Actually, a lot of languages (including Spanish, German and French) have a distinction like this syntactically but it doesn’t really mean the same thing as it does in English. reply SamBam 12 hours agorootparentHuh, I just had a fairly long and fruitless conversation with ChatGPT 4 trying to understand whether this was true. ChatGPT kept insisting that romance languages distinguish between the preterite (\"he did,\" simple past tense) and the present perfect (\"he has done\"), but every time I asked it to give me specific examples it would start translating them, find that they were the same, and then say \"well, in Italian [or French] it&#x27;s actually more about context...\"Finally it was able to give me the Spanish \"Él hizo esto\" vs \"Él ha hecho esto,\" but admitted that whether one used one vs the other was quite regional. reply trealira 10 hours agorootparentIn French, they only use the equivalent of the simple past tense in books, but in speech they usually only ever say the equivalent of \"has done\" in speech no matter the context. I don&#x27;t speak French (not as a second language nor as my native language), but this is something I&#x27;ve read about secondhand in textbooks and online.In Spanish, they do make a distinction in neutral speech, but it&#x27;s not uncommon for someone to only ever use one or the other depending on the region they&#x27;re from. The auxiliary verb form (\"haber hecho\" &#x2F; \"to have done\") is more common in Spain than Latin America. Though, I don&#x27;t know how much we should go into this; I feel like we&#x27;ve kind of derailed from the original topic. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if it is just the result of applying some transformation to “was underfunded for decades” in an attempt to make it cover the present. reply boisgerault 14 hours agorootparentprevA Gallicism :) reply umanwizard 10 hours agorootparentThanks, I knew there was a word I was forgetting… reply Obscurity4340 17 hours agorootparentprevDepuis ? reply umanwizard 16 hours agorootparentThat can be used with either a duration (“depuis des décennies”) or a point in time (“depuis 1995”).
