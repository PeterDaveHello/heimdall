    "originBody": "For those of us who understand that the obvious is not always the solution, and that the facts, no matter how implausible, are still the facts ... A complaint was received by the Pontiac Division of General Motors: \"This is the second time I have written you, and I don't blame you for not answering me, because I kind of sounded crazy, but it is a fact that we have a tradition in our family of ice cream for dessert after dinner each night. But the kind of ice cream varies so, every night, after we've eaten, the whole family votes on which kind of ice cream we should have and I drive down to the store to get it. It's also a fact that I recently purchased a new Pontiac and since then my trips to the store have created a problem. You see, every time I buy vanilla ice cream, when I start back from the store my car won't start. If I get any other kind of ice cream, the car starts just fine. I want you to know I'm serious about this question, no matter how silly it sounds: 'What is there about a Pontiac that makes it not start when I get vanilla ice cream, and easy to start whenever I get any other kind?'\" The Pontiac President was understandably skeptical about the letter, but sent an engineer to check it out anyway. The latter was surprised to be greeted by a successful, obviously well-educated man in a fine neighborhood. He had arranged to meet the man just after dinner time, so the two hopped into the car and drove to the ice cream store. It was vanilla ice cream that night and, sure enough, after they came back to the car, it wouldn't start. The engineer returned for three more nights. The first night, the man got chocolate. The car started. The second night, he got strawberry. The car started. The third night he ordered vanilla. The car failed to start. Now the engineer, being a logical man, refused to believe that this man's car was allergic to vanilla ice cream. He arranged, therefore, to continue his visits for as long as it took to solve the problem. And toward this end he began to take notes: he jotted down all sorts of data, time of day, type of gas used, time to drive back and forth, etc. In a short time, he had a clue: the man took less time to buy vanilla than any other flavor. Why? The answer was in the layout of the store. Vanilla, being the most popular flavor, was in a separate case at the front of the store for quick pickup. All the other flavors were kept in the back of the store at a different counter where it took considerably longer to find the flavor and get checked out. Now the question for the engineer was why the car wouldn't start when it took less time. Once time became the problem -- not the vanilla ice cream -- the engineer quickly came up with the answer: vapor lock. It was happening every night, but the extra time taken to get the other flavors allowed the engine to cool down sufficiently to start. When the man got vanilla, the engine was still too hot for the vapor lock to dissipate. Moral of the story: even insane-looking problems are sometimes real.",

A member of staff reported that their mouse would stop working between certain hours of the day. It had apparently been okay in the morning, stopped working over lunchtime then started again later.On some days it would work perfectly all day long, but on others it would stop working between those hours.The biggest clue was it would always work perfectly on overcast days, but on sunny days this strange behaviour would manifest again.Turns out the problem was related to the mouse being a cheap mouse. The case had very thin plastic.The mouse was a ball mouse, and it worked by shining an LED into a sensor on each of the X and Y axes. On sunny days the sun would completely overpower the sensor due to the plastic case being very thin and on overcast days it would not. On sunny days the mouse would only work when the sun had moved around the sky to cast a shadow over where the mouse was being used.Perfectly logical but baffling at first. reply kqbx 16 hours agoparentReminds me of a problem that I had (many years ago) with my iPhone 4 - if I tried to boot it in a dark place, it would get stuck on the Apple logo in an infinite boot loop.Turns out some versions of the Pangu jailbreak for iOS 7.1.x would crash during boot if the reading from the ambient light sensor was below some threshold. To this day I don&#x27;t know the exact explanation of this bug, but it seems that Pangu included some unnecessary code that messed with the light sensor [1].If you don&#x27;t believe me, there is a huge reddit thread[2] with a lot of people confirming this.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;jailbreak&#x2F;comments&#x2F;294wob&#x2F;jailbreak...

No matter how unimportant. reply saagarjha 10 hours agorootparentprevSeems unlikely. I don&#x27;t have access to the paste but from the comment below it I think it&#x27;s probably a false positive that Pangu was doing something with the sensor. (Not that I don&#x27;t doubt that the sensor could be the problem, it&#x27;s just that the code is not very conclusive.) reply 98codes 17 hours agoparentprevI had a similar problem, but in the opposite direction. My cable internet speeds at home were fairly good (for the US, anyway), but sometimes would absolutely bottom out. Not dead, just glacially slow. After troubleshooting everything under the sun, I came to realize that the problems would happen not when it was raining per se, but when it was heavily foggy or misting. Normal to heavy rain was fine.Called the cable company, tech came out. Everything inside was fine, but the cable from the main line to the house had a tiny cut in one spot, not enough to really affect the connection, but enough for ambient moisture to work its way in and foul the connection. reply liotier 17 minutes agorootparentA customer&#x27;s DSL connection dysfunctioned every evening during December - but worked fine the rest of the year... Culprit: interference from nearby Christmas decorations leaking EM all over the place.A customer&#x27;s DSL connection dysfunction&#x27;s frequency increased mornings and evenings. Culprit: the lift&#x27;s electric motor leaking EM all over the place.A bunch of DSL connections degrade when traffic increase... Crosstalk in big cables of course !The sort of fun incidents that take a good while to troubleshoot... I&#x27;m glad we are migrating away from DSL to fiber: either it works or not ! reply genewitch 15 hours agorootparentprevon dslreports or broadbandreports there&#x27;s at least two instances of me complaining about two cable companies because, at last, it was figured out there was moisture ingress in the LE (line extender, usually on cable lines on poles). The only common denominator was it happened during prime time, every night, and went away around midnight.The other common denominator was the cable company refusing to believe it was an issue with their equipment; this meant it took a couple of months of calling them every night until they finally sent a technician and a manager to my house to verify that I wasn&#x27;t wrong, leaving my house, coming back 15 minutes later to say \"it&#x27;ll be fixed tomorrow, there&#x27;s a problem with the LE balance up the road\" - and then the issue is resolved.Now this doesn&#x27;t sound so bad, until you learn that the first time this happened to me, i had only VoIP - so the internet would start to foul, i&#x27;d call the cable company, and the tier 1 would reset my modem at some point, and then i wouldn&#x27;t be able to call back until after midnight (or whatever), when there was no longer a problem. So after a week of this, i would walk 30 minutes - one way - to a pay phone (remember those?) once the internet slowed, call them, explain that i couldn&#x27;t do anything they wanted me to do physically, since they disconnected my phone line every time i called.This is what happens with a de facto monopoly.I will never pay suddenlink another dime, even if they&#x27;re the only terrestrial provider, for whatever reason. reply creeble 14 hours agorootparentInteresting, I wonder if I’m experiencing something a little bit similar that Comcast can’t seem to debug.Almost every day, in the heat of summer, I get one to five 10-minute outages as soon as the temp gets over about 80F. More when it’s hotter, usually. Usually it results in a modem reset, so it’s hard to tell how long the actual outage is.Been happening for going on 5 years. They replaced the under-street cable from our house to the junction box across the street to no effect. I suspect it’s that junction box, but afaict, none of my neighbors that share that junction box have the same issue. Not very fun to have your WFH day collapse unexpectedly in the middle of the afternoon.Strangely, for the last month we’ve had several days of 80+ temps with no sign of outage. So fun.Edit: yes of course multiple modem replacements and inside cable checks, to no avail. reply itzworm 3 hours agorootparentSeveral day&#x27;s of 80+ temps, meaning it hasn&#x27;t dropped below 80? Possibly it is just getting above 80 before you start your work day. And not dropping below until after your work day has ended?I&#x27;ve experienced something similar except for temperatures below ~32-36 degrees. At this particular location it would result in a ~1hr outage going below that temperature, but not when it went back above it for some reason. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentprevWe had the same problem at an old house. There was a cable splitter in the attic that was expanding in the heat and losing connection to the cable. We bought a heftier one and moved it under the insulation in the attic. reply abofh 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, probably very similar thing if that pattern is true. It&#x27;s the shift forcing your modem to change speeds, but neither side being willing to accept it.If you can, try forcing a level at&#x2F;below the speed you get during the breakage and see if it just rides it out. If it does, shift it back up and plan your coffee breaks around it. Or don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not your mother reply notnaut 14 hours agorootparentprevI think you’d get this problem, monopoly or not, whenever cost saving measures are in place (and they always are, for good reason) at the customer-interface level.Maybe there should always be a hidden option that only people that meet a certain troubleshooting ability threshold get access to when calling in for tech support…. reply aftbit 12 hours agorootparentSHIBBOLEEThttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;806&#x2F; reply Projectiboga 14 hours agorootparentprevThat time is an intersection of heavy home use and when the dew hits. reply lxgr 16 hours agorootparentprevHaving had to debug many of such cable issues in the past, it&#x27;s baffling to me that cable companies aren&#x27;t proactively monitoring for things like this.They have all the data available on their end, as far as I can tell! (Unless DOCSIS modems somehow don&#x27;t have a standard \"signal receive report\" functionality?) reply Animats 15 hours agorootparentTelcos used to monitor their copper outside plant for moisture. This was called Automatic Line Insulation Testing in the Bell System. The ALIT system ran in the hours before dawn. It would connect to each idle line, and apply, for tens of milliseconds, about 400 volts limited to very low current between the two wires, and between each wire and ground, measuring the leakage current. This would detect moisture in the cable. This was dealt with by hooking up a tank of dry nitrogen to the cable to dry it out.Here&#x27;s a 1960s vintage Automatic Electric line insulation test system at work in a step-by-step central ofice. [1] Here&#x27;s the manual for automatic line insulation testing in a 5ESS switch.[2] 5ESS is still the major AT&T switch for copper analog phone lines. After that, it&#x27;s all packet switching.For fiber, of course, moisture doesn&#x27;t affect the signal.This led to an urban legend: \"bell tap\". While Western Electric phones were designed to not react to the ALIT test signal, many cheap phones would emit some sound from the \"ringer\" when the 400V pulses came through, some time before dawn.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Wt1GGdDa5jQ[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manualslib.com&#x2F;manual&#x2F;2755956&#x2F;Lucent-Technologie... reply swores 12 hours agorootparentGreat comment, thanks!(I&#x27;ve sent a quick email suggesting it be added to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;highlights :) reply Animats 8 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re really into telephony history, the Internet Archive has \"The History Of Engineering and Science in the Bell System\" (3 volumes) online.If you have to build reliable distributed systems, it&#x27;s worth understanding how this was done in the electromechanical era of telephony, where the component reliability was much worse than the system reliability. \"Number 5 Crossbar\"[1] is worth reading, but hard to follow if you have no idea how telephone switching worked and are unfamiliar with the terminology.Number 5 Crossbar, in current terms, was a collection of microservices. There was a big, dumb switch fabric, and \"markers\" which told it what to connect. Other microservices included trunks, originating registers (which listen to incoming dial digits), senders (which sent dial digits to the next switch), billing punches (which recorded toll call data for later billing), translators (which held routing tables), and trouble recorders (which logged errors.) Central offices had at least two of each resource, for redundancy. Resources were \"seized\" as needed from resource pools, with a hardware timeout and alarms to prevent resource lockup. If something went wrong in setting up a call, it was retried once, using different resources. If it failed on the second try, the caller got a fast busy and there was an alarm and a trouble recorder dropped a trouble card. Markers did not have persistent state. They started each call with a reset. So they could not get stuck in a bad state.In the entire history of the Bell System, no electromechanical switching office was ever down for more than 30 minutes for any reason other than a natural disaster or a fire. It&#x27;s worth understanding how they did that.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;telephoneworld.org&#x2F;mdocs-posts&#x2F;number-5-crossbar-sys... reply Aeolun 6 hours agorootparentNot truly related to the post content, but there is something about the way these old manuals are formatted&#x2F;printed that immediately inspires confidence in the contents.Maybe because you know that someone spent a lot of time on it before it was published since no adjustments could be made after the fact. reply ColinWright 1 hour agorootparentprevWe still have a land line. When a call comes through the phone often gives a gentle \"peep\", then a pause, then goes full-on ring. I&#x27;ve started to react to the \"peep\".But every evening, mostly around 21:00 or so, the phone gives a gentle \"peep\" without then ringing.I wonder if it&#x27;s a line test? reply ciabattabread 8 hours agorootparentprevAh, so that&#x27;s why there were always nitrogen tanks on NYC sidewalks. reply justsomehnguy 9 hours agorootparentprev> Wait! Was that an old adding machine?At 02:40.And yes, it is an adding machine. reply yafbum 15 hours agorootparentprevIn my observation, to a first approximation, cable operators take off-the-shelf equipment, connect it, power it on, and bill customers for it. They don&#x27;t really have the r&d capability to innovate and create new monitoring solutions quickly.It might happen that an equipment manufacturer sees an opportunity and builds something, but then they have to go into a long sales cycles to convince operators to use it. Operators are in a duopoly situation in most places, so quality of service is kind of a secondary concern for them - customers may get annoyed, but as long as the competition is not vastly superior, few actually switch. It is not a market prone to innovation. reply RHSeeger 4 hours agorootparentprevI had a similar problem, due to an old line running to my house; liquid getting in, etc. And when it acted up, I&#x27;d call the cable company and be like \"look, I can show you I&#x27;m losing packets right now... I need you to run tests on your end to confirm\". And every time, they&#x27;d tell me they could schedule a tech to come out and take a look at it. Only, I couldn&#x27;t \"schedule\" the problem to occur when the tech came out.. so they&#x27;d come out, declare all was fine, and leave. It was infuriating.Eventually I called so many times and had so many appointments, that the tech lead gave me his direct number and told me to call him directly the next time it happened. When it did, I did, and he ran some tests, and confirmed there was a problem. I don&#x27;t know that we ever got it sorted out (it was a while ago), but just getting them to agree there was an issue took a very long process. reply lostlogin 16 hours agorootparentprevMoisture in copper cables is what slowed me down too. It was in a section up the road from me. However now that fibre is installed, it’s glorious and works in the rain. reply donalhunt 14 hours agorootparentprevCommon issue in Ireland for DSL customers. Damaged copper cabling would leak water when it rained causing dropouts and lower speeds. Telecom engineers would call out on days when the copper had dried out and be unable to find any fault. Turns out correlating such reports with weather reports is hard. :&#x2F; reply fullspectrumdev 13 hours agorootparentI’d suspected that, but kept it to myself because it sounded a bit mad reply jeiebx83 15 hours agorootparentprevI ran into a similar issue, except internet and phone would get really bad on a cold morning.Tech showed up around noon, saw I was indeed having a bad connection, went and checked the signal at the junction box for the street (can&#x27;t remember what you call these) and everything was normal there, so he closed it back up again and double checks the signal at the house again, but it was fine. He walks the lines to double check but everything looked normal.His best guess was that moisture was condensing ever so slightly inside the junction box that morning, and was let out as soon as he opened it at around noon, which fixed the problem. reply MalcolmDwyer 17 hours agoparentprevWe have a countertop ice maker that gets jammed up and overloaded with ice on sunny days for a similar reason.There&#x27;s an infrared beam and sensor. When the ice tray is full, it is supposed to block the beam, and then the machine stops making ice.On a sunny day, there&#x27;s enough bright light in our kitchen to fool the sensor so it keeps making ice.We have a random magazine that we put on top of it to make it work correctly. reply m463 17 hours agorootparentI have a garage door that will not close on sunny days.Same sort of problem. The obstruction sensor at the bottom of the door is confused by the strong sunlight and the door stops closing part way and re-opens.I&#x27;ve tried a toilet-paper tube around the sensor but that isn&#x27;t always successful. I really wish there was a laser sensor to replace it with. reply kuroguro 15 hours agorootparentThe sad thing is there are certain IR wavelengths that are a lot less affected by the sun and nobody bothered to check for an outdoor product... reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agorootparentThe garage door obstruction sensors are located inside the garage, so it technically might be an indoor product.Although, the possibility of a garage being oriented such that the sunlight would directly hit the sensors while the garage door is open seems like it could be a not infrequent occurrence. reply dharmab 4 hours agorootparentprevIs it a Genie system? My old Genie system had that exact same problem. Even making large sun shields out of Amazon boxes didn&#x27;t fix it.I had to replace my opener and door anyway and had a conversation with a tech about it. We decided on a LiftMaster in part because their sensors are very good at dealing with sunlight. reply tbyehl 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat sucks is those sensors are designed so you can&#x27;t just jump a wire to permanently defeat them.You can, however, tape the sender and receiver together. reply geocar 5 hours agorootparentprevPaint your garage floor black: less light will reflect.It also is a lot easier to see fallen bolts and shit on a black floor than on a white&#x2F;gray one. reply giraffe333 12 hours agorootparentprevI have this exact problem and (mostly) fixed it by swapping the sensor and transmitter. I just cut the wires and spliced with electrical tape. Now the problem still happens but only sometimes in the fall and spring when the sun&#x27;s angle is just right. This is with a west facing garage about 41°N latitude USA.But yeah, why this isn&#x27;t laser based, or using a light frequency that is less affected by sunlight? Probably cost, or ignorance. reply dharmab 4 hours agorootparentIt varies by brand- some brands are better at filtering out sunlight than others. The home builder should know not to use certain brands in garages that face the sun... but they often don&#x27;t.It&#x27;a not laser based so the sensors don&#x27;t have to be perfectly aligned.

It turned out that instead of using physical switches inside it used pairs of lights and detectors that would give false positive results when ambient light shined on them. reply aksss 14 hours agorootparentas in an optocoupler? Those are the coolest, especially for dealing with different voltages. reply alexdbird 4 hours agorootparentNo, there&#x27;s not any call for high voltages in a VCR, outside the feedback loop of a SMPS if it&#x27;s fancy. The most common thing to use light sensors is just detecting the difference between tape and clear leader at the ends of the tape (or broken tape). reply mlegendre 7 hours agoparentprevYour mouse story makes me think of the day the CI system at work turned out not to be robust to vibrations.One day we started having flaky tests, seemingly out of nowhere. We quickly identified that the issue affected tests involving graphical X client applications, but then we struggled to make further progress. The issue was just impossible to reproduce in other conditions... Well, as it happens, the CI jobs were running on some desktop machines we had installed somewhere within our premises. It turned out that some gentleman had plugged a mouse into one of the machines, and left it lying around on the shelf. Since then, when one of the machines was under a heavy load, the fans would spin faster, causing more vibrations, in turn causing the mouse to move, ever so slightly. And for ungodly reasons, this had side effects on tests.Fun fact: the machines were not on my site, I managed to diagnose this over SSH. I was quite proud :-) reply dharmab 4 hours agorootparent> And for ungodly reasons, this had side effects on tests.Let me guess - tests with very tight timings? reply jonhohle 15 hours agoparentprevWhen it’s sunny, my wife’s car can’t open the garage door, and my car requires getting extremely close. Once the sun goes down, we can both open the door from the street.It turns out our solar panels (or the optimizers, or the inverter) emit radio frequencies that interfere with our garage door opener. When the sun is out and they are producing energy, the interference is stronger than the homelink garage door opener.A few years ago the garage door openers started working fine. It took a few days to realize it was because the inverter had failed.I’m fairly certain there are some FCC regulations that would require our installer to fix it, but that relationship soured during installation and I’d rather deal with an unusable garage remote than dealing with them for warranty work. reply _whiteCaps_ 14 hours agorootparentSome clip on ferrites on the inverter cables might help.If you have any amateur radio neighbours they&#x27;d probably love to help you with a project like this. reply LazyMans 8 hours agorootparentprevIf you get a SDR, you can watch the interference and try things to help reduce it. An SDR should be like $20 and you plug it into a computer reply midoridensha 4 hours agorootparentprevHow old is the garage door opener? Older ones used frequencies that are more susceptible to interference from certain sources. It&#x27;s possible to buy new receivers to connect to your existing door opener. reply djmips 15 hours agorootparentprevJust curious but did you try any bodged shielding? reply ssl-3 7 hours agoparentprevI have a similar stories.The first was a VDSL connection I had at home. It worked great (fast, for the time) except when it didn&#x27;t. It always failed in the evening. Techs would come out, bless it as being good, and leave -- because of course it worked while they were there. Unless they showed up and it was broken and then they&#x27;d declare that it was an outside problem, and that they&#x27;d have to get someone else to fix it (because the residential techs can&#x27;t do overhead work).I made lots of (very polite) phone calls, which results in more refunds and more service calls. More than once, my driveway and the street in front of my house looked like an AT&T convention.This went on for months.I had direct numbers and emails for tier 3 support and the local manager who oversaw this plant. We were all getting to know eachother too well, and there were boots on the ground addressing this problem as many as three times in week.I eventually noticed that as the days got shorter so did the evening outages...and that if it was a cloudy day, then that day was often outage-free.I had an epiphany: The problem might correlate with the angle of the sun, and the duration of exposure!I checked my logs and the past weather, and sure enough: It lined up.So I reported my findings, even though they seemed like nonsense as the words came out of my mouth, and they sent out some crazy-haired guy with bluejeans and an untucked shirt who was clearly not used to wearing a uniform, and who was also obviously not normally customer-facing.\"I know exactly why they can&#x27;t find the problem,\" he said after I reiterated what I&#x27;d learned. \"Your neighborhood still has old lead-sheathed overhead lines, and nobody knows how to work on that anymore.\"\"But I&#x27;m certified on that. I&#x27;m going to go back to the shop, pick up a bucket truck and get your line fixed. It will take me most of a day to do this, but I will be back when I&#x27;m done.\"And it was getting pretty late, but he did come back to let me know that he found some things and fixed them. And I don&#x27;t know what those things were, but it was fine after that -- and it stayed fine.Thermal expansion letting cosmic rays leak into copper pairs wrapped in paper, tar, and lead? Who knows. I certainly don&#x27;t know.I&#x27;ve never encountered that stuff professionally (and it isn&#x27;t your grandfather&#x27;s 25-pair cable) and as this dude said, \"nobody knows how to work on that anymore.\" reply nvy 9 hours agoparentprevYour car repeatedly doesn&#x27;t start so instead of taking it to the shop, you... write a letter to the CEO of Pontiac who not only actually reads the letter but also personally dispatches an engineer to waste a week going out for ice cream?

Senior developer and me share a shocked glance. \"Is this every friday?\" \"Why yes! We conserve lots of energy that way.\" Senior and me share another glance and on impulse I speak up. \"Isn&#x27;t the weekly db cleanup scheduled for 16:30 PM on fridays?\" The senior developer nods. We spend the remaining hour to fix the problem and then cancel this weeks schedule and manually shut down the DB server for the time being. Every friday these guys cut the power to the building, causing all kinds of production issues with not only their Netware Server but also the DB server for their collections software (our product). As per maintenance contract we were required to repair the DB everytime which was a hassle and a waste of ressources on our behalf.

There was no budget for hardware though, so it ended up running on a repurposed workstation in somebody&#x27;s office. One Tuesday even the cleaners unplugged it to vacuum and it didn&#x27;t power back up after being plugged in. On Wednesday somebody helpfully stuck a piece of paper saying \"don&#x27;t unplug\" to it, which seemed to solve that problem until the whole project was mothballed.In the late 90s, I worked at a company where we started getting complaints from the staff about machines being getting slower over time. Nobody took it seriously until there was an inventory of machines taken and we found that a large amount had significantly less memory installed than they should have, somebody was stealing half the memory sticks from each. Hidden cameras were installed in the office and it turned out that somebody on the cleaning crew came with a screwdriver and ESD bags and knew how much to take to leave the machines working. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentGoes again to show the usual thing that gets you caught is repetition.Had he struck once or twice and then left the rest alone nobody may ever have figured it out. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 12 hours agorootparentI would expect the repetition generally comes out of necessity.

Airplane had to be put on a flatbed to get it back home.Guess he didn&#x27;t see my note! reply bombcar 13 hours agorootparentSounds like it might have been dieseling - enough carbon buildup glowing hot that even with both magnetos off it can still ignite the next rotation.Usually there was a fuel disconnect along with the throttle that would eventually starve the engine. reply HeyLaughingBoy 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s probably what I did. Thinking back, the first time it happened, it just took about 10-15 seconds to shut off. The next time, when I was back at my home airport, it wouldn&#x27;t stop running at all and I think I turned the fuel cutoff to get it to stop. reply grecy 12 hours agorootparentprevThe radiator fan in my Jeep did that in Sudan when it was 48C. Better to have it stuck on that stuck off in those temps!I just tapped the relay with a wrench and it un-stuck and turned off.Funny enough that was almost 5 years ago, and it hasn&#x27;t done it once since in more than 80,000 miles of driving. Not in -35C, not in +45C. Odd little relay. reply hobomatic 16 hours agoprevThis reminds me of a strange recurring experience I used to have with electronics in my house.In that house,on certain days of the week at midnight, something that sounded like recordings of political speeches from WW2 would be audibly (but faintly so) from all of stationary electronics. It was so faint, that it was usually hard to pinpoint any one source, and the words used weren&#x27;t understandable, so it usually sounded like it was coming from everywhere all at once, and like it was an old recording.This would happen even if they were unplugged. Even if my power went out.I though I was either going crazy, or my house was literally haunted by hitlers ghost.Well one day I was in my car and recognized something on the radio that reminded me of this spooky problem I had.It was the signon of a Catholic am radio station that opened up with Gregorian chanting, and a sermon. This signon happened at the same time on the same days of every week.Turns out, the wiring in that house was somehow functioning as an am radio receiver, and some common components would vibrate out the audio encoded in the radio signal. reply guyzero 15 hours agoparentAM radio is a terrible transmission format in many ways but it&#x27;s good because as you note it&#x27;s extremely easy to decode into sound! reply margalabargala 9 hours agorootparentAM radio receivers are so easy to make that they scare people who make them accidentally!A pair of old not-plugged-in computer speakers can also be an AM radio receiver. reply donatj 2 hours agoparentprevNear my work, there is a roughly 25 foot stretch of road in front of a factory where seemingly every FM station is overpowered by Muzak.

Quick links Follow us on Instagram Try ChatGPT (DALL·E 3 coming soon!) About DALL·E 3 DALL·E 3 is now in research preview, and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October, via the API and in Labs later this fall. Modern text-to-image systems have a tendency to ignore words or descriptions, forcing users to learn prompt engineering. DALL·E 3 represents a leap forward in our ability to generate images that exactly adhere to the text you provide. Even with the same prompt, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements over DALL·E 2. DALL·E 2 “An expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula.” DALL·E 3 DALL·E 3 is built natively on ChatGPT, which lets you use ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner and refiner of your prompts. Just ask ChatGPT what you want to see in anything from a simple sentence to a detailed paragraph. DALL·E 3 in ChatGPT When prompted with an idea, ChatGPT will automatically generate tailored, detailed prompts for DALL·E 3 that bring your idea to life. If you like a particular image, but it’s not quite right, you can ask ChatGPT to make tweaks with just a few words. DALL·E 3 will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in early October. As with DALL·E 2, the images you create with DALL·E 3 are yours to use and you don't need our permission to reprint, sell or merchandise them. DALL·E 3 in ChatGPT 1:00 A focus on safety Like previous versions, we’ve taken steps to limit DALL·E 3’s ability to generate violent, adult, or hateful content. Preventing harmful generations DALL·E 3 has mitigations to decline requests that ask for a public figure by name. We improved safety performance in risk areas like generation of public figures and harmful biases related to visual over/under-representation, in partnership with red teamers—domain experts who stress-test the model—to help inform our risk assessment and mitigation efforts in areas like propaganda and misinformation. Internal testing We’re also researching the best ways to help people identify when an image was created with AI. We’re experimenting with a provenance classifier—a new internal tool that can help us identify whether or not an image was generated by DALL·E 3—and hope to use this tool to better understand the ways generated images might be used. We’ll share more soon. Creative control DALL·E 3 is designed to decline requests that ask for an image in the style of a living artist. Creators can now also opt their images out from training of our future image generation models.

I&#x27;ve already started thinking about how I could incorporate some kind of comparison feature.Because there&#x27;s no way to control the seed, a direct comparison (using a before&#x2F;after slider, for example) probably wouldn&#x27;t make sense.

Like stable diffusion 1.4 vs 1.5 and 2.0 and 2.1 will make identifiably similar images, but 1.5 vs 2.1 vs SDXL won&#x27;t look remotely similar.Even more so because I&#x27;d wager they changed their encoder and&#x2F;or decoder too.* I think that if they generated something like a controlnet for guidance the same way in both models then they might be comparable but from my understanding Dalle2 doesn&#x27;t work that way at all.Comparisons would still be interesting though! reply davidbarker 15 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re right — I thought about it a little more after I replied.I guess it&#x27;ll just have to be comparisons of the general concepts.

There seems to be enough of a pattern to create a million reasonable hypotheses - curiosity makes me want to which it really is!Looking at the images it&#x27;s particularly interesting how it seems to have never once gotten the text correct, always just being a little bit off. Well sometimes way off, but mostly quite close. reply gwern 9 hours agorootparentPoints to them still relying on a single small text embedding which is lossy instead of full cross-attention; but the fact that it can follow instructions reasonably well at least means that they&#x27;ve moved off CLIP - phew! It was frustrating arguing with people about DALL-E 2 limitations which were ultimately due to nothing but CLIP. reply epivosism 14 hours agoparentprevYeah, it&#x27;s really strange how hard they make it to manage, download, and get full prompts for your images on all these platforms. I made this discord bot for midjourney which with some easy configuration can download and annotate all your images, including as much info as I could grab about version, etc. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ernop&#x2F;social-ai&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;SocialAIEven then it&#x27;s not perfect since I&#x27;m getting info off of the command you send, which may have fallen into whatever the defaults were at the time, and so when interpreted today, not easily possible to reconstruct the version&#x2F;seed&#x2F;etc. from that point in the past, if you didn&#x27;t include it in the prompt.

It&#x27;s absolutely incredible to have your pictures with the associated prompts. Thanks a ton! reply davidbarker 13 hours agorootparentVery kind of you to say — thanks! reply nextworddev 16 hours agoprevThoughts:- ChatGPT integration is absolutely huge (ChatGPT Plus and enterprise integrations coming in October). This may severely thwart Midjourney and a whole bunch other text-to-image SaaS companies, leaving them only available to focus on NSFW use cases. - Quality looks comparable to Midjourney - but Midjourney has other useful features like upscaling, creating multiple variations, etc. Will DallE3 keep up, UX wise? - I absolutely prefer ChatGPT over Discord as the UI, so UI-wise I prefer this. reply jonplackett 16 hours agoparentWhat I think could be amazing about ChatGPT integration is (holding my breath…) the ability to iterate and tweak images until they’re right, like you can with text with ChatGPT.Currently with Midjourney&#x2F;SD you sometimes get an amazing image, sometimes not. It feels like a casino. SD you can mask and try again but it’s fiddly and time consuming.But if you could say ‘that image is great but I wanted there to be just one monkey, and can you make the sky green’ and have it take the original image modify it. Then that is a frikkin game changer and everyone else is dust.This _probably_ isn’t the way it’s going to work. But I hope it is! reply blensor 15 hours agorootparentI am using Automatic1111 and SDXL and this is exactly the workflow people are doing with that.Generate an image, maybe even a low quality one. Fix the seed and then start iterating on that reply genewitch 14 hours agorootparentdo you have a link on how this is done? what does \"fix the seed\" mean? I was experimenting last night with seed variation (under Extra checkbox next to the seed input box) and i couldn&#x27;t accurately describe what the sliders did. Sometimes i&#x27;d get 8 images that were slight variations, and sometimes i&#x27;d get 3 of one style with small variations, and then 5 of a completely different composition with slight variations, in the same batch.As far as the OP goes, they claim you don&#x27;t need to prompt engineer anymore, but they just moved prompt engineering to chatgpt, with all of the fun caveats that comes with. reply tavavex 7 hours agorootparentI think by \"fixing the seed\" they just meant using the \"Reuse seed from last generation\" button. By default, this will mean that all future images will get generated with the same seed, so they&#x27;ll look identical. The \"variation seed\" thing mixes slight variations into this fixed seed, meaning that you&#x27;re likely to get things that look similar, but not identical to the original. The \"variation strength\" slider controls how much impact from the variation seed is mixed into the original, with 0 being \"everything from the initial seed\", and 1 being \"everything from the variation seed\". I&#x27;m pretty sure that leaving the width&#x2F;height sliders at their default positions is fine.Also, just for future reference - lots of UI elements in A1111 have very descriptive tooltips, they help a lot when I can&#x27;t quite remember the full effects of each setting. reply nextworddev 16 hours agorootparentprevExactly - iterative \"chat-driven\" improvement of images will be a paradigm shift reply gsuuon 16 hours agorootparentprevThat looks exactly like what was in the video (though the video seems to be down?) reply jonplackett 15 hours agorootparentDidn’t see a video! OK I am pretty excited now.So long as it actually can create an image virtually the same but changed only how I want it. That would just blow everything else away.I mean I guess it’s. Or that ridiculous. Generative fill in photoshop is kind of this, but the ability to understand from a text prompt what I want to ‘mask’ - if that’s even how it would work - would be very clever reply epiccoleman 15 hours agorootparentYou can _kind_ of do this now, but it&#x27;s excessively manual. I agreed that it would be awesome to have the AI figure out what you mean to iterate on a given image.I recently had a somewhat frustrating experience of having a generated foreground thing and a generated background that were both independently awesome - and trying to wheedle Stable Diffusion into combining them the way I wanted was possible, but took a lot of manual labor, and the results were \"just ok\". reply brianjking 16 hours agoparentprevDall-e 2 had variations, inpainting, etc well before Midjourney. However, I 100% agree that it&#x27;s going to be interesting to see who and what wins this race. reply rvz 15 hours agorootparentStability AI with Stable Diffusion is already at the finish line in this race, by being $0, open source and not being exclusively a cloud-based AI model and can be used offline.Anything else that is &#x27;open source&#x27; AI and allows on-device AI systems eventually brings the cost to $0. reply chankstein38 15 hours agorootparentI agree. I am barely excited for DALL-E 3 because I know it&#x27;s going to be run by OpenAI who have repeatedly made me dislike them more and more over the last year plus. My thoughts are: \"Cool. Another closed system like MidJourney. Chat integration would be cool but it&#x27;s still going to likely be crazy expensive per image versus infinite possibilities with Stable Diffusion.\"Especially with DALL-E. Honestly I&#x27;d be more excited if MidJourney released something new. DALL-E was the first but, in my experience, the lower-quality option. It felt like a toy, MidJourney felt like a top-tier product akin to Photoshop Express on mobile, still limited but amazing results every time, and Stable Diffusion feels like photoshop allowing endless possibilities locally without restrictions except it&#x27;s FREE! reply ramraj07 14 hours agorootparentThey all have their place. OpenAI literally started every major AI revolution including image gen with DALL-E. Let them be the peleton while SD and others follow closely and overtake eventually. reply chankstein38 14 hours agorootparentI like painting them as the peleton! You&#x27;re not wrong it&#x27;s just not super exciting for me reply genewitch 14 hours agorootparentprevthere has a to be a way to link the API from automatic1111 and a \"gpt\" or \"bert\" model, to allow similar flexibility, right? The only issue i see is training the llm on the rules of image composition correlated to what CLIP&#x2F;Deepbooru sees. maybe there will be a leak, or someone can convince one of the \"AI Art example&#x2F;display\" sites to give them a dump of images with all metadata. enough of that and this sort of thing seems like a \"gimme\".I just started training LoRA, and the lack of definitive information is a burden; but following the commonalities in all of the guides i was able to get a LoRA to model a person i know, extremely accurately, about 1&#x2F;8th of the time. in my experience, getting a \"5 star\" image 12% of the time is outstanding. And when i say 1&#x2F;8th i mean i ran off 100 images, and hand ranked the ones that actually used the LoRA correctly, and 4 and 5 star ranks were 21&#x2F;100 - i just double checked my numbers! reply Karunamon 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a different race entirely; most people don&#x27;t even have the hardware, let alone the knowledge to run SD. reply junipertea 15 hours agorootparentprevunless it&#x27;s way worse reply shmoogy 14 hours agorootparentSDXL and older models are quite good. It&#x27;s not yet very user friendly but will get there. reply cubefox 14 hours agoparentprev> ChatGPT integration is absolutely hugeProbably not.

With LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) you describe everything in an image that is not what you want the model to model.

At worst, you might have to remove other styles&#x2F;artists in the tags. the model will only learn about the style. supposedly. I don&#x27;t follow art enough to have a favorite style; i don&#x27;t have enough source material on hand to do a style model, nor do i know enough to go out and grab a dataset.As an aside, textual inversion also made some great inroads into this sort of thing.

While it may be easier to create images, you still need some artistic sense and skills to figure out which ones are appealing. In the bigger picture I think this basically means that illustration-type art will become more of a curatorial activity, in which being able to filter through masses of images becomes the predominant skill needed. reply timeon 16 hours agoparentSomething like photography? reply keiferski 15 hours agorootparentYeah I think that’s a good comparison.

I’d wager that if you’re able to create a baseline image to feed in, your results will be better. The better the input, the better the output. It definitely feels like a situation where artists who can leverage ai will be the ones pulling ahead in the commercial sector. reply keiferski 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t really work that way. Yes, you can use images as a source, but they are more just mined for “pieces” to rearrange, not overall aesthetic effects. reply minimaxir 15 hours agorootparentThat is not how image-to-image approaches work.ControlNet is a obvious counterexample.

But IMO there&#x27;s still room for artists with taste and technical talent to manipulate images closer to a curated ideal. Like the current SD photoshop workflows where generated content creates a base.

Corporations have some of the same rights as people in certain legal transactions because treating them as entities rather than each individual within a corporation separately is more convenient, and because to do otherwise would in some cases infringe upon the rights of the individual humans who make up the corporation (for example, corporations have a right to free speech because the individuals within that corporation have a right to free speech, and it would be impossible to deny free speech to corporations without also denying it to individuals.)But systems of law are still capable of recognizing the distinction between the personhood of corporations and of people, just as they can recognize the difference between humans and AI even if AIs can be demonstrated to \"learn\" the way humans do. As always, context and nuance matter. Laws aren&#x27;t written or decided upon based on pure logic or calculus but on what human beings want and consider to be in their self-interest. reply wwarner 16 hours agorootparentprevSo the law says that a painter can&#x27;t steal copyrighted images, but a programmer can.

But indeed niches that are saturated by enshitified content have almost crashed and I get your point. I suppose the average will turn even more average and indeed people will stop spending money on it. AI being a statistical machine it will excell at making whatever is common and plenty and as such those industries will suffer even more. Average music, content writing, drawings, etc, will drop to near zero value, that&#x27;s guranteed. reply alec_irl 15 hours agorootparentThe comment you&#x27;re replying to is referring to the video game industry crash in North America in the early 1980s. Basically the market was flooded with games of poor quality due to a lot of factors, including Atari&#x27;s complete lack of quality control on games they put on their 2600 console. Nintendo ended up redesigning their Famicom console as the Nintendo Entertainment System with an emphasis on it looking like a VCR as opposed to a cheap game console like NA audiences were used to (the Famicom itself is fairly small and plasticky with permanently attached controllers). Additionally they were strict about licensing development on the system with the goal of fostering a crop of family friendly, high quality games. It was a couple years after the fact (iirc) but Nintendo&#x27;s efforts to differentiate themselves in the wake of the crash obviously payed off and led to a long period of Japanese ascendancy in the games markets. So the crash cleared out a lot of the market and led to a huge opportunity for Nintendo. reply jncfhnb 14 hours agorootparentIdk. I think this an overcomplexification. To a large extent, the NES was an instant success because Super Mario Bros was simply an amazing game. reply tavavex 6 hours agorootparentNo, this has been directly confirmed by Nintendo developers at various points. For people to even be able to try SMB, they&#x27;d have to be convinced that the NES wouldn&#x27;t suffer the fate of the Atari 2600 and the like. It wasn&#x27;t just about the VCR-looking design - the marketing materials had very careful wording to avoid associations with the failed game consoles, and accessories like R.O.B.

I don&#x27;t see what this principle is supposed to be: as my analogy shows, there is clearly no general moral principle against learning from copyrighted material and people&#x27;s hard work without their explicit permission. The more narrow interpretation, in which the claimed principle is that a machine must not learn from copyrighted material (...), is also implausible: since we have no real history of machines learning from copyrighted material in any way that is recognizable as learning, it stands to reason that a principle addressing that scenario can not yet have become general.The appeal is thus to a completely novel principle that you have come up with for yourself; and it seems that rather than presenting arguments for why others should adopt this principle, you are trying to present it in such a way that someone not paying close attention would be fooled into believing that it is common sense and widely accepted.

If you define AI this is I think either trivially true or trivially false.In the cases where it&#x27;s false (you could get an artificial human) it still doesn&#x27;t obviously lead to bad real life consequences, because that relies on another unfounded leap from superintelligence to \"takes over the world\" ignoring things like, how does it pay its electricity bills, and how does it solve the economic calculation problem.It&#x27;s more like having children.

Many, because Python is a programming language.Given these assumptions, one easily imagine that Html is a weaker language than Python.So if Html is weak, let&#x27;s make it stronger! Let&#x27;s add some more Html headers of webpages, than three. Html has now 1 million headers! Is it less weak now? Does it come closer in strength to Python?No, because the formal properties of Html did not change at all, no matter the number of headers. So, do the formal properties of the grammar generator called GPT, are any different related to how many animals it got statistical data on? No, the formal properties of GPT&#x27;s grammar did not change at all, if it happens to know about 3 animals or a trillion. reply tysam_and 15 hours agorootparentprevWhile I dislike the silliness that you&#x27;re alluding to, I think you&#x27;re using multiple meanings of the phrase &#x27;AI Safety&#x27; there all lumped into one negative association.There are risks, esp in a profit-motivated capitalistic environment.

Of course we won&#x27;t know until October but I suspect you could prompt v3 to get a style closer to v2 if you wanted. reply starshadowx2 12 hours agoparentprevThis is actually an interesting issue the Midjourney team has thought a lot about. As each version has gotten \"better\", ie more realistic, there&#x27;s been some loss of the \"artistic\" side. There are a lot of users who still use the old V2 model (compared to the most recent V5) specifically because of how \"bad\" it was. The grimy and less coherent parts are what they&#x27;re actually looking for, instead of a more precise or perfect looking result. This has led to there being flags for adding in more stylisation or \"weirdness\" or being able to choose between more realistic or more artistic versions of models. reply dinkblam 16 hours agoparentprevagreed. the new version (which they obviously view as so much better that this is their one \"we made improvements\" sample) is just repugnant reply timeon 15 hours agorootparentreminds me kitsch reply ricree 16 hours agoparentprevArtistic preference aside, the Dall-E 3 version definitely follows the prompt closer (in the it shows someone dunking a ball). reply prvc 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s part of my point.

I reached out to them four or five months ago as we explored offline-first frameworks, and its awesome to see how far they&#x27;ve come in a short time.We didnt find anyone else who was tackling the tie between client-side SQLite, an open source CRDT&#x2F;sync layer, and Postgres. We found a few who were attempting to manage this in a closed source way, but it didn&#x27;t make sense to give up control of the server&#x2F;auth, and every other fully open source solution was SQLite -> SQLite, not Postgres.Great stuff from some killer engineers. reply roncesvalles 12 hours agoparentConceptually sounds like this is what Firebase, Couchbase Lite, and Mongo Reach do in the NoSQL world. reply canadiantim 18 hours agoprevI want to be able to have a Postgres database as the central source of truth for all data and user accounts, but then have each users private content to be siloed and synced to their own SQLite database which they alone have access to (maybe even they’re have one SQLite file on server and one SQLite file on phone or etc.).

We have a solution where old clients can store objects that have new fields unknown to the client. Then when the clients updates the data is visible.Do you have client libraries for mobile? Swift & Kotlin?Does it support partial sync and fetch when you need an “archived” item? In my experience you only want the “working set” of data on the client. Not everything.Cool work! CRDTs are the solution to this. reply vbalegas 2 hours agoparentIt works similarly: migrations flow as part of the replication stream and clients apply them immediately, so that new data fits the local schema. New columns and etc might not immediately be exposed to the client app, but everything will works for old clients.You can learn more about our support for migrations here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;usage&#x2F;data-modelling&#x2F;migration...Native clients will be coming a bit later.You can use the shapes to control what data syncs to the device: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;usage&#x2F;data-access&#x2F;shapes reply nerdyadventurer 56 minutes agoparentprevI was also going to ask about mobile clients, then saw your comment. reply jchw 15 hours agoprevI saw this recently and I am really excited for, hopefully, a renaissance in local-first apps; it&#x27;s been quite a long time coming. That said, it seems like there&#x27;s still a lot of problems to work on in this space and it&#x27;ll take a while for different approaches and implementations to approach their local maxima.I am curious about encryption. Assuming that ElectricSQL is handling essentially all of the syncing, is it possible to build applications that use end-to-end encryption for some of their state? I am wondering specifically because CRDTs seem to simplify E2EE a lot since well, any client that can write can resolve conflicts any time. I haven&#x27;t looked very deeply yet as I&#x27;ve been very busy, but to me that&#x27;s the main thing I&#x27;ve been really curious about. I know you can at least do this with Y.js which helpfully provides a way to use symmetric encryption for WebRTC synchronization, but this obviously is a whole lot more than that. reply samwillis 15 hours agoparentAbsolutely, we are really keen to support an encryption pattern. We are at the design phase, the current thinking is to have a hook enabling developers to provided their own encryption callback so that you can have unencrypted data in the local database. Essentially encrypting and decrypting, on and off the sync layer. reply klabb3 15 hours agoparentprevYou can always encrypt local data even if the metadata is not encrypted. But that restricts it to the device itself by default, not even your other devices on the same account can read it.If you want encrypted and shared with other devices or users you have to surface key management to users which is very difficult to do. Signal and a few others do this but they’re very bespoke to the specific business logic. To provide a general purpose abstraction layer is still an open problem, afaik. reply jchw 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not asking for the problem of key derivation to be solved by ElectricSQL per se, just wondering if it can handle E2E encrypted data in any way. That said, I disagree with how difficult it is: there are a lot of approaches that are not too ridiculous. For example, a simple approach to E2EE is to use a PAKE like SRP to do password authentication, then since the password is kept secret, you can use a normal KDF to derive a symmetric key from the password. From here, you can e.g. store symmetric and public key matter on a server or synced across your clients, encrypted using the password&#x2F;KDF. If this sounds familiar, it&#x27;s exactly how password managers work and the main downsides are that it requires password authentication (can&#x27;t use any auth mechanism that doesn&#x27;t somehow discretely convey a secret to the client) and the forgot password situation is more complicated (if you have no backups of the key, you can&#x27;t recover any data. However, that&#x27;s not an unreasonable compromise in exchange for E2EE.)Just like TLS, it&#x27;d probably be bad if most people implemented SRP from scratch. That said, I did write my own implementation of SRP-6a (a variant of SRP based on the RSA cryptosystem) in TypeScript and I found it fairly simple to do. There are also PAKEs that provide even better security properties than SRP-6a, but good implementations of them are still lacking for now.What Matrix does seems pretty simple, it just has a lot of moving parts and nuance; the underlying keys are essentially sent directly between clients after a key exchange is performed and verified out of band to ensure there is no eavesdropping and that the two clients are connected to who they think they are.As far as I know, Signal sidesteps key management almost entirely and only allows one logged in device, and everything else must proxy through it. That&#x27;s pretty lame, though I understand the stakes are very high to get it &#x27;right&#x27; and keeping the moving parts to a minimum was likely high priority. reply klabb3 11 hours agorootparentI don’t disagree with your technical assessment per se but I would would not label any of this “pretty simple”, except for special purpose apps with technically competent users.Academically it’s in a decent state, but tech- and UX wise I’d say it’s immature. It virtually penetrates all layers of a normal stack (including layer 8). For apps it’s at least possible but the web is very tricky as a platform for anything e2ee without absurd usage requirements.The tech choices that remain after deciding on an e2ee model are severely limited and language dependent, and spans deeply across persistence layers, software updates, authn, authz, social graphs, moderation etc etc. And even so, there are many subtleties in terms of privacy and information leakage that are often necessary compromises for features that many apps take for granted today. Without any social aspects it’s significantly easier (eg PAKE is best suited for for interactive&#x2F;online two-party operations). reply jchw 11 hours agorootparentI do agree that the UX of a lot of E2EE software is pretty bad, and if you wanted to make e.g. a chat application, then yeah, it&#x27;s not necessarily \"simple\". In practice it can become quite a mess. And honestly, I think a lot of apps have just done a poorer job than what would&#x27;ve been possible without much hassle because it&#x27;s relatively new territory for a lot of developers.On the other hand though, we&#x27;re talking in the context of local-first apps, and the set of constraints imposed by local-first apps already does limit you substantially. If anything, local-first is more complicated in a lot of regards; in my mind, the worst part about E2EE is trying to keep track of all of the different keys you wind up needing to wrangle, whereas with local-first, usually, you&#x27;re all-but guaranteed to run into CRDTs first-thing, which impose a whole bunch of limitations on the structure of data and the operations you can perform on that data. It is possible to share things in a local-first app, but there are limitations to how much a CRDT-based app can scale for a single document.And that&#x27;s why arguably, it&#x27;s one of the perfect places to add encryption. If you&#x27;re already talking about apps that deal with small-scale documents and that necessarily do most of the work on the client, you may as well encrypt it. All of the clients are \"equal\" as far as the data structure goes and the server(s) mainly exist to sync to; it&#x27;s perfect.When thinking about the E2EE UX of local-first apps, I think of password managers and not chat applications. I think it&#x27;s closer to the former than the latter in terms of constraints. reply klabb3 3 hours agorootparentAgree with all of these points.

I have a lot of questions :)* I am by no means a crdt expert, but from my tinkering I have come to the opinion that the upside of the consistency does come at the cost of ease of understanding how state ends up how it does, which can bleed into user facing issues if how a crdt converges conflicts with intuition. A lot of that seems like an education and design problem and I am curious how you are thinking of talking that? Do you plan on some support for server-first writes for situations where crdt might not fit?* from the docs it seems like adding electric to a table does a migration to add new columns &#x2F; new tables, I assume, to support the crdt, but my other knowledge of crdts is that it can be expensive in terms of size, especially for preserving history. I will have to poke at it to learn more, but I do wonder where you think you shouldn&#x27;t enable electric?* I am curious at the commercial model?

We don&#x27;t target high volume data ingestion, etc.Re: commercial model, we&#x27;re designed for open source self-host.

The service could be easily updated and changed, and without changes the database. Any database could be used. Could have LDAP integration and other services.I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t understand CRDTs. Can they be used with database changes that are not part of the CRDT history? That is, can they be added to an existing database with other clients? reply kiitos 11 hours agorootparentA CRDT is a discrete entity&#x2F;object that has to follow a set of rules for reads, writes, and storage -- including, but not limited to, rules about how to maintain history. You can certainly mix-and-match CRDTs with other entities in the same database, but you can&#x27;t like \"fold in\" arbitrary changes to a CRDT without following the rules. reply koolba 19 hours agoprevIs there any validation or authorization for changes being merged back into the root database?In a traditional client &#x2F; server model, the server has an opportunity to validate each request and optionally reject it. The lower level you go with the sync protocol (data changes vs high level requests) the more difficult that becomes.Have you addressed that and, if so, how?

It sounds like you are still figuring out how this should work.The \"right\" answer is to author an OIDC authentication module for Postgres and license it in a way that Amazon will steal it for the purposes of actual adoption; or try to add it to PGBouncer as a proxy, converting JWTs in the password field into \"set local user.id = ...\" and similar in a preamble for every sql statement.Projects like postgrest have been down this journey and spell out their solutions. It&#x27;s all a little vague with Supabase, there isn&#x27;t anything magical about their authorization approach either, but I wouldn&#x27;t keeping looking to them as the gold standard implementation for web backend stuff.Anyway, none of this exists in SQLite, which is a huge pain in the butt. SQLite looks promising, and then it&#x27;s missing all this stuff, because it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for SQLite to have row level security or JWTs or whatever. That&#x27;s the issue isn&#x27;t it? Like why not step back and say, \"is SQLite right for me, if it&#x27;s not only missing all these features I need, but also they will never be added to SQLite because it doesn&#x27;t make sense for SQLite to have them?\"Separately, when I visit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;local-first, it&#x27;s ironic, the local first says its latency is 3ms, but because it had to load all this code and stuff, it took longer than 237ms of the \"cloud-first\" box for that 3ms number to even appear.

We don&#x27;t want to do anything special here, we want our solutions to be as interoperable as possible with existing approaches reply ochiba 17 hours agoparentprevThe route that we went with for PowerSync (disclosure: co-founder) is to allow to define your own function for handling writes, where you would use your (presumably existing) backend application API to persist the writes to Postgres. Therefore you can handle any validation&#x2F;authZ&#x2F;business logic for writes in your backend layer.The PowerSync client SDK still handles the queueing and retrying of writes so that they can be automatically retried if network connectivity is not available — whenever there is a retry, your callback function is called. (As a result of this approach, your write function should be idempotent; we commend using GUIDs or UUIDs generate client-side for primary keys)Similar to Electric, PowerSync also uses JWT for auth against your backend.There are some architecture diagrams explaining this on our docs root here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.powersync.co&#x2F; reply cebert 8 hours agorootparentCan you please stop posting as much about PowerSync on a Show HN thread centered on ElectricSQL? reply meiraleal 14 hours agorootparentprevYou are really taking the expression `shameless plug` to another level in this thread, aren&#x27;t you? reply ochiba 14 hours agorootparentGenuinely excited about this space and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m focused on full-time so definitely have thoughts to share.

I reached out to James when they were searching for early adopters for their V2 version, which focuses on PostgreSQL. Our primary business involves developing Line of Business (LOB) applications. We decided to transform our LOB applications into low&#x2F;no-code platforms to empower our customers with extensive customization needs to be self-sufficient.We assessed nearly every new data solution available and ultimately chose Electric. We recognized that the combination of SQLite&#x27;s convenience on the client-side and PostgreSQL&#x27;s flexibility on the server-side is a potent foundation for our work.I&#x27;ve spent years grappling with the challenges of the local-first (lo-fi) approach, particularly when using the PouchDBCouchDB combination to support vital offline features in our Point of Sale tools. While not every feature aligns with the lo-fi concept (even though real-time synchronization status on the client can significantly reduce the need for numerous API end points), having PostgreSQL on the backend grants us access to a wealth of existing tools and support built around PostgreSQL. This assurance provides us with peace of mind, knowing that we won&#x27;t encounter insurmountable obstacles, and any challenges we face will be no more daunting than those encountered in traditional server-based API programming paradigms.I sincerely hope that ElectricSQL achieves the recognition it deserves and can implement many of the ideas outlined in their roadmap documentation. These ideas have the potential to overcome the initial hurdles that have hindered the widespread adoption of the lo-fi approach.In the meantime, we&#x27;re having a great time developing an opinionated, React-based low-code tool (internally, we refer to it as \"Visual Basic using React\").

I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this out. Currently I get this functionality by using PouchDB on the client with a CouchDB sever. Then on my API server I have some janky code in a cron job to sync changes from CouchDB to PostgreSQL. reply samwillis 17 hours agoparentHey, I work at Electric,The CouchDB&#x2F;PouchDB pattern is how I originally got interested in local first, they are such a good tool, but having the full power of Postgres and then SQLite on the client, I believe, is a real game change.Sounds like Electric could be a really good fit for your use case. If want any advice join the Discord and we are happy to help out. reply davidkuennen 3 hours agoprevCongrats to the team. Very nice project.I&#x27;m interested in your calculation for compute cost savings. You have savings of 40k$ for 2k queries per second.

Apparently you&#x27;re comparing it to AWS Aurora which charges for the amount of queries. reply thruflo 2 hours agoparentYup, it&#x27;s not the most sophisticated of cost calculator, obviously there&#x27;s a wide variation in cost savings from reducing query and compute load and the reduction is app specific.edit: we based some of the calculator variables on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fauna.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;compare-aws-aurora-serverless-v2-arch... reply zubairq 5 hours agoprevI just looked at the size of Sqlite in the browser as sql.js compared to WASM Sqlite in the broswer. sql.js seems to be over 2MB and WASM sqlite in just 900k, is that right? If so then does this make WASM Sqlite quite a good contender to replace things like Alasql in the browser (which is around 400k). Anyway views on this ? reply roblh 11 hours agoprevVery cool. I haven’t quite worked out how, but I wonder if you could use this for writing really fast integration tests somehow for CI workflows, using some subset of real (or I guess more like curated) data.

Seems like missing `href` on the \"Find out how »\" buttons reply vekker 17 hours agoprevWow, this is awesome! I&#x27;ve been \"waiting\" for a project like this for years - having to roll out my own syncing solution for my local-first app until now.I have yet to dive deeper in the docs and examples, but does anyone know how easy it would be with Electric to provide some kind of client-side transformations (encryption&#x2F;decryption) of specific fields or entire rows in your SQLite db before syncing? A major reason to go local-first, is often privacy, and the idea that the user owns their data...Also, it&#x27;s unfortunate permissions haven&#x27;t been implemented yet; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;usage&#x2F;data-modelling&#x2F;permissio... If I understand correctly, that means in a multi-user system, everyone will sync everyone else&#x27;s data?And too bad my favorite stack (Angular + Nest.js backend) isn&#x27;t supported, but I guess it should still be straightforward to integrate the client-side and run the sync service in the backend. I might try it if I have a weekend... reply vbalegas 16 hours agoparentValter from Electric here,Handling encryption&#x2F;decryption of user data is one of our priorities. We&#x27;re thinking along the lines of adding hooks for transforming data as you&#x27;re seeing it.We&#x27;re getting there on permissions implementations. If you want to do row-based filtering based on user_id today, you can add a special column &#x27;electric_user_id&#x27; to your table: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;roadmap#shapesWe plan to integrate Electric with popular web frameworks: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;frontend. To integrate with Angular, the client should work out of the box. What you&#x27;d need is to provide is the code for reactivity, which should not be a lot. Reach out on Discord and we can have a chat about it. reply mnahkies 15 hours agorootparentAre you &#x2F; have you considered leveraging postgres&#x27; row level security for this (row filtering)?

Your example linear app has 112 rows, could you support 1000? 10K? 100k? 1M? reply samwillis 19 hours agoparentOP here, I work for Electric,Electric is designed to support partial sync, and so you don’t have to sync your whole dataset. (Note that this is feature is under development and not yet public)There are limitations on how much data a browser will store for an individual site, so the number of rows you can sync will depend on the shape of your dataset. Finally there are also some performance considerations with WASM SQLite, this is something the SQLite team are working on in collaboration with the browser developers, particularly with the development of the new OPFS apis which we plan to support as they mature.So, thousands of rows are definitely viable, and we have that working with our own internal development tests. Hundreds of thousands or millions may cause issues right now, but are something we do want to support. reply slashdev 19 hours agorootparentI wish they didn’t remove sqlite from browsers “because it’s not an open standard”. It was one very important thing in common between mobile and web, and now it’s clunky and slow on web when running over WASM. I don’t see how that was in any way good for users. reply tln 19 hours agorootparentYeah but SQLite doesn&#x27;t protect against unlimited CPU use and has historically had issues where \"malicious queries\" cause crashes -- not OK for a browser to surface to scripts.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;cves.html> Almost all CVEs written against SQLite require the ability to inject and run arbitrary SQL.> The advertised consequence of most CVEs is \"denial of service\", typically by causing a crash through a NULL pointer dereference or a division by zero, or similar.> But if an attacker can already run arbitrary SQL, they do not need a bug to cause a denial of service. There are plenty of perfectly legal and valid SQL statements that will consume unlimited CPU, memory, and disk I&#x2F;O in order to create a denial-of-service without requiring help from bugs.> Hence, the mere fact that an attacker has a way to inject and run arbitrary SQL is in and of itself a denial-of-service attack. That the arbitrary SQL might also tickle a bug in SQLite and cause a crash is not a new vulnerability. reply slashdev 18 hours agorootparentJavaScript can do that too. Web browsers defend against DoS attacks in the browser by popping up an alert asking if you want to kill the tab process or not. I don’t see why sqlite can’t be run under that model as well. reply ochiba 17 hours agorootparentprevWe wrote a bit about SQLite implementations and associated performance considerations for web here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.powersync.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sqlite-persistence-on-the-web reply dustingetz 9 hours agorootparentprevYou’re saying you have partial sync already working for browser sized datasets say 5k rows which are an arbitrary subset of server records which are much larger? What limitations are there on the query criteria for client-synced records, can the subset be expressed as an arbitrary join? How do you implement local first on arbitrary join? reply ochiba 17 hours agoparentprevRelevant — PowerSync [1] (similar to Electric; disclosure: co-founder) is currently designed to efficiently sync around 1M rows, or roughly 1GB of uncompressed data. More would be possible, but performance may degrade. In the future we plan on pushing it to handle larger data volumes.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.powersync.co&#x2F; reply vladstudio 14 hours agoprevYou might want to update the github star counter on your homepage :-) It said 333 during my visit, while on Github itself it&#x27;s 1.3K already.

[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;usage&#x2F;data-access&#x2F;shapes#data-loading reply vbalegas 1 hour agoparentApps with large dataset have their own characteristics: they are more tolerant to slower initial sync. We can resume replication at point-in-time, so even if a shape takes long to load, we can resume replication at the point we started synching the shape.We will be working on the engineering to handle transferring large shapes. reply j0e1 10 hours agoprevI see OPFS being mentioned a few times by team members. I could not find any estimates on the website, but could any of the folks in the know share any details? I work on an Electron-based text editor which uses the filesystem to manage text files. Something like this would really be useful to me if it supported plain text files. reply steida 19 hours agoprevCongrats! The world needs more local-first software, but many find a complete switch hard and practically impossible, so reusing existing Postgres DB is an excellent idea. I suppose there is a space for more solutions; that&#x27;s why Evolu takes a more radical and clean approach with complete privacy by default without opt-out. Also, a dependency on third-party servers should be limited as much as possible, so that&#x27;s why Evolu Server is super simple and generic for all Evolu clients. Another Evolu feature is the simplicity of the code. CRDT shouldn&#x27;t be a black box only people with Ph.D. can understand. So, if anyone is interested in another approach, check https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;evoluhq&#x2F;evolu. reply mjadobson 17 hours agoprevI am fully on the offline-first bandwagon after starting to use cr-sqlite (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vlcn.io), which works similar to ElectricSQL.I thought the bundle size of wasm-sqlite would be prohibitive, but it&#x27;s surprisingly quick to download and boot. Reducing network reliance solves so many problems and corner-cases in my web app. Having access to local data makes everything very snappy too - the user experience is much better. Even if the user&#x27;s offline data is wiped by the browser (offline storage limits are a bit of a minefield), it is straightforward to get all synced changes back from the server. reply tantaman 14 hours agoparentYeah, 1mb of WASM != 1mb of JS.WASM is much faster to start up since you don&#x27;t have all the parsing and compiling overhead. reply JaneLovesDotNet 4 hours agoprevWould this work as a tool to sync a central server&#x27;s parts of your postgres data to your distributed webapp backends local-copy, as opposed to all the way to user front-end. i.e. nodejs instead of the browser.Or is there a better tool for that? reply vbalegas 1 hour agoparentyes, ElectricSQL works for webapps with nodejs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;server&#x2F;no... reply rococosbasilisk 17 hours agoprevCongrats to the team.

How does this solve that? reply roncesvalles 12 hours agoparentYou can&#x27;t guarantee \"correctness\" (if you define that as zero information loss and&#x2F;or external causal consistency) in any multi-leader system partly because of unsynchronized clocks and partly because, well, you have to deal with the conflict somehow. You can think of CRDT as a tool to minimize relevant information loss (ideally to zero) when two concurrent writes are converged. reply brigadier132 9 hours agorootparentI get that which is why I was curious how ElectricSQL got this to work because SQL databases generally do have a \"correct\" state. reply malablaster 14 hours agoprevI remember pitching this idea to a team of colleagues about 11 years ago.

Also, is there a specific use-case you&#x27;ve seen where this shines particularly brightly? reply samwillis 18 hours agoparentHey, I work for Electric.The WASM module is just a standard build of SQLite, about 1.1mb - there are many landing pages 10x that size - and something that we think is easily justifiable for the types of apps that people can build with Electric.In terms of use cases, there are numerous, broad-ranging possibilities - anything from a replacement for GraphQL or a REST API in your existing stack, all the way up to building large collaborative apps. Our intention is that you can build collaborative tools similar to Linear, and we do actually have a demo of this sort of thing (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linear-lite.electric-sql.com), but it’s certainly not limited to that. reply tantaman 17 hours agorootparentYou can get that size down to 600KB using brotli compression fwiw.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content SVELTE.DEV CTRL K Docs Examples REPL Blog Tutorial SvelteKit Introducing runes Rethinking 'rethinking reactivity' THE SVELTE TEAM SEP 20 2023 ON THIS PAGE In 2019, Svelte 3 turned JavaScript into a reactive language. Svelte is a web UI framework that uses a compiler to turn declarative component code like this...let count = 0;function increment() { count += 1;} clicks: {count}...into tightly optimized JavaScript that updates the document when state like count changes. Because the compiler can 'see' where count is referenced, the generated code is highly efficient, and because we're hijacking syntax like let and = instead of using cumbersome APIs, you can write less code. A common piece of feedback we get is 'I wish I could write all my JavaScript like this'. When you're used to things inside components magically updating, going back to boring old procedural code feels like going from colour to black-and-white. Svelte 5 changes all that with runes, which unlock universal, fine-grained reactivity. Introducing runes Before we begin permalink Even though we're changing how things work under the hood, Svelte 5 should be a drop-in replacement for almost everyone. The new features are opt-in — your existing components will continue to work. We don't yet have a release date for Svelte 5. What we're showing you here is a work-in-progress that is likely to change! What are runes? permalink rune /ro͞on/ noun A letter or mark used as a mystical or magic symbol. Runes are symbols that influence the Svelte compiler. Whereas Svelte today uses let, =, the export keyword and the $: label to mean specific things, runes use function syntax to achieve the same things and more. For example, to declare a piece of reactive state, we can use the $state rune:let count = 0;let count = $state(0);function increment() { count += 1;} clicks: {count}At first glance, this might seem like a step back — perhaps even un-Svelte-like. Isn't it better if let count is reactive by default? Well, no. The reality is that as applications grow in complexity, figuring out which values are reactive and which aren't can get tricky. And the heuristic only works for let declarations at the top level of a component, which can cause confusion. Having code behave one way inside .svelte files and another inside .js can make it hard to refactor code, for example if you need to turn something into a store so that you can use it in multiple places. Beyond components permalink With runes, reactivity extends beyond the boundaries of your .svelte files. Suppose we wanted to encapsulate our counter logic in a way that could be reused between components. Today, you would use a custom store in a .js or .ts file: import { writable } from 'svelte/store'; export function createCounter() {const { subscribe, update } = writable(0);return { subscribe, increment: () => update((n) => n + 1)}; } Because this implements the store contract — the returned value has a subscribe method — we can reference the store value by prefixing the store name with $:import { createCounter } from './counter.js';const counter = createCounter();let count = 0;function increment() { count += 1;} clicks: {count} clicks: {$counter}This works, but it's pretty weird! We've found that the store API can get rather unwieldy when you start doing more complex things. With runes, things get much simpler: import { writable } from 'svelte/store'; export function createCounter() {const { subscribe, update } = writable(0);let count = $state(0);return { subscribe, increment: () => update((n) => n + 1) get count() { return count }, increment: () => count += 1 }; }import { createCounter } from './counter.js';const counter = createCounter(); clicks: {$counter}clicks: {counter.count}Note that we're using a get property in the returned object, so that counter.count always refers to the current value rather than the value at the time the function was called. Runtime reactivity permalink Today, Svelte uses compile-time reactivity. This means that if you have some code that uses the $: label to re-run automatically when dependencies change, those dependencies are determined when Svelte compiles your component:export let width;export let height;// the compiler knows it should recalculate `area`// when either `width` or `height` change...$: area = width * height;// ...and that it should log the value of `area`// when _it_ changes$: console.log(area); This works well... until it doesn't. Suppose we refactored the code above: const multiplyByHeight = (width) => width * height; $: area = multiplyByHeight(width); Because the $: area = ... declaration can only 'see' width, it won't be recalculated when height changes. As a result, code is hard to refactor, and understanding the intricacies of when Svelte chooses to update which values can become rather tricky beyond a certain level of complexity. Svelte 5 introduces the $derived and $effect runes, which instead determine the dependencies of their expressions when they are evaluated:let { width, height } = $props(); // instead of `export let`const area = $derived(width * height);$effect(() => { console.log(area);}); As with $state, $derived and $effect can also be used in your .js and .ts files. Signal boost permalink Like every other framework, we've come to the realisation that Knockout was right all along. Svelte 5's reactivity is powered by signals, which are essentially what Knockout was doing in 2010. More recently, signals have been popularised by Solid and adopted by a multitude of other frameworks. We're doing things a bit differently though. In Svelte 5, signals are an under-the-hood implementation detail rather than something you interact with directly. As such, we don't have the same API design constraints, and can maximise both efficiency and ergonomics. For example, we avoid the type narrowing issues that arise when values are accessed by function call, and when compiling in server-side rendering mode we can ditch the signals altogether, since on the server they're nothing but overhead. Signals unlock fine-grained reactivity, meaning that (for example) changes to a value inside a large list needn't invalidate all the other members of the list. As such, Svelte 5 is ridonkulously fast. Simpler times ahead permalink Runes are an additive feature, but they make a whole bunch of existing concepts obsolete: the difference between let at the top level of a component and everywhere else export let $:, with all its attendant quirks different behaviour between andthe store API, parts of which are genuinely quite complicated the $ store prefix $$props and $$restProps lifecycle functions (things like onMount can just be $effect functions) For those of you who already use Svelte, it's new stuff to learn, albeit hopefully stuff that makes your Svelte apps easier to build and maintain. But newcomers won't need to learn all those things — it'll just be in a section of the docs titled 'old stuff'. This is just the beginning though. We have a long list of ideas for subsequent releases that will make Svelte simpler and more capable. Try it! permalink You can't use Svelte 5 in production yet. We're in the thick of it at the moment and can't tell you when it'll be ready to use in your apps. But we didn't want to leave you hanging. We've created a preview site with detailed explanations of the new features and an interactive playground. You can also visit the #svelte-5-runes channel of the Svelte Discord to learn more.

(Hi from wentin) It&#x27;s great to see you here in this thread. It&#x27;s such a wonderful gesture for the open-source community to collaborate in this manner, by sharing valuable lessons learned the hard way.It’s intriguing to see where the Svelte exploration will lead. Will it face disapproval or achieve success? While I agree that both implementations have arrived at the same place (almost serendipitously), their origins differ. For Vue, it&#x27;s about adding the syntactic sugar by dropping .value, making it less explicit and more magical. In contrast, Svelte made the change to make things more explicit and reduce the “black magicness” from the svelte compiler, and bring it more similar to javascript. This difference might trigger totally different reaction, time will tell.Looking forward to more insightful discussions! reply tipiirai 5 hours agoparentprevI guess we are all waiting for Rich Harris to step in and comment on this one. I&#x27;m sure he has followed this Vue experimentation and has a clear argument to make. At least I hope so. reply vjerancrnjak 2 hours agoparentprevAll of this looks like MobX reply satvikpendem 19 hours agoprevThis is basically what Vue and Solid do, no? Same sort of state and derive&#x2F;computed variables, it seems like.Also, I will never understand why people like reactive signals. The article even quotes \"Knockout being right all along\" which, no, reactivity and two way data binding creating a spaghetti mess of changes affecting other changes all over the place unless you&#x27;re really careful is why React was made in the first place, to have only one way data binding and to re-render the entire page in a smart way. React will soon get its own compiler as well which will made regenerating the DOM even more efficient.It&#x27;s like every other framework is slowly rediscovering why React made the decisions it made. I am assuming it&#x27;s because the users who are making these frameworks now have not used or do not remember the times where \"signals\" were called observables, or the usage of Rx libraries, and how having too many of these would cause you to lose your mind debugging the intricate webs you inadvertently spun. reply rich_harris 19 hours agoparentYes, Vue and Solid — like Knockout — use a dependency tracking mechanism. Back in the day it was called `ko.observable`, nowadays we call them signals.That&#x27;s the part Knockout was right about. It&#x27;s absolutely true that you can mishandle them and create a spaghetti mess, _if your design allows it_. Svelte 5 doesn&#x27;t — it uses signals as an implementation detail, but in a way that prevents the sorts of headaches you&#x27;re describing.Signals and observables (e.g. RxJS) are related but separate concepts. The framework world is converging on signals as the appropriate mechanism for conveying reactivity — even Angular (which has historically been most closely tied to RxJS) is moving in this direction. I promise you it&#x27;s not just a mass delusion. reply hajile 18 hours agorootparentNot everyone has teams of perfect developers given all the time they want to make their perfect frontend app. Most of us deal with average teams where half the devs are at or below par while managing very tight deadlines. The spaghetti from everything in the whole system mutating always comes back to bite.You call signals an \"implementation detail\", but if someone doesn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s what they are, then they&#x27;ll wind up doing very bad things. This means they either aren&#x27;t just an implementation detail or they are a hyper-leaky abstraction. reply rich_harris 18 hours agorootparentWhat I mean by &#x27;implementation detail&#x27; is that you _literally can&#x27;t get a reference to a signal_ in Svelte 5. This alone prevents people from mutating things in unexpected ways. reply corbezzoli 17 hours agorootparentprev> You call signals an \"implementation detail\",You haven’t even seen Svelte 5 yet, I don’t think it’s fair to say its internals will create trouble yet. reply oooyay 16 hours agorootparentprevPretext: I&#x27;m a backend developer that often needs to stare into the abyss that is frontend.I used to say these same things about reactivity. It was highly confusing to me years ago; as a backend developer doing frontend tasks was always reaching outside of my cookie jar and testing the boundaries of what I knew vs what I thought I knew. Many headaches ensued. That said, using Vue 3 and Svelte 4 has made utilizing stores and reactivity a lot more obvious in my opinion. Things render when they&#x27;re supposed to and my applications remain performant. As a non-frontend person, I mainly like the APIs that Vue and Svelte bring. In React I&#x27;m almost always switching to class based components for what I can do in the compositional API in Vue or what&#x27;s natively possible in Svelte. That brings a lot of repeated code and doesn&#x27;t look as clear to people not as familiar with React. reply satvikpendem 16 hours agorootparentSeems like your comment cut off there, but if you&#x27;re using class components in React, there will be repeated code, yes, which is why hooks were invented and why they enable you to reuse such code. reply ricardobeat 11 hours agorootparentAnd lose most of the &#x27;reactivity&#x27; since you&#x27;ll now be doomed to manually track your own dependencies everywhere. reply steve_adams_86 9 hours agorootparentCan you explain why that is?I find hooks are flexible enough that I tend to be able to implement more sane and manageable reactivity, not the opposite.Maybe I’m misunderstand your issue, though. reply gedy 15 hours agorootparentprev> Not everyone has teams of perfect developers given all the time they want to make their perfect frontend app.Yes, but having gone through this at previous companies, the average&#x2F;non-front end specialist developers definitely had an easier time understanding 2 way binding ala Knockout, MobX, Svelte, etc. The Redux style stuff was only pushed by the frontend brainiac types. reply jinushaun 3 hours agorootparentMore like so easy to shoot themselves in the foot. React’s one-way data binding philosophy is defensive position against spaghetti code. reply chrisco255 19 hours agorootparentprev> create a spaghetti mess, _if your design allows it_. Svelte 5 doesn&#x27;t — it uses signals as an implementation detail, but in a way that prevents the sorts of headaches you&#x27;re describing.Care to elaborate or do you have a link to a blog post explaining further? reply rich_harris 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll try — I&#x27;m currently fielding a zillion messages so excuse brevity!Basically, you can only modify state _where it&#x27;s declared_. If you want to allow the &#x27;outside world&#x27; to modify that state, you need to expose a function that does so. This is unlike cases where you&#x27;re passing around an observable object where anyone with a reference, which they need for reading, can also write to it by doing `thing.value += 1`.This is something Solid gets right — you can only change a signal&#x27;s value if you have a reference to its setter. reply troupo 16 hours agorootparent> fielding a zillion messagesSurely you mean signals? :) reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the reply, Rich. It seems that, given a large enough codebase, that sort of spaghetti mess will emerge on its own, as not everyone will be so thorough. Granted, I haven&#x27;t used runes and based on your blog post here, I&#x27;m not reading where it would prevent such headaches as there&#x27;s not much mention of that there, so I don&#x27;t know exactly how it&#x27;d work, but just based on my experience using things like Vue and Knockout in the past, it wasn&#x27;t too clean.I was just mentioning in another comment how Rust has a similar problem where, as in C, you can mutate variables via pointers anywhere in the codebase, but Rust counters that by having a borrow checker that explicitly tracks the changes made and makes sure that only one user can modify a variable at any one time. An analogous concept might be quite interesting to implement in all these signal based frameworks as well. reply ttfkam 17 hours agorootparent> An analogous concept might be quite interesting to implement in all these signal based frameworks as well.Which is what Svelte 5 is doing with its compiler.> […] given a large enough codebase, that sort of spaghetti mess will emerge on its own, as not everyone will be so thorough.LOL! You&#x27;ve just described React projects! Yes, of course you and your team are wonderful and have all the FP experience, so obviously this isn&#x27;t an issue for YOU.Most React codebases however turn into big balls of mud. Enormous balls of useMemo-y, useEffect-y, re-render the world-y, spaghettified mud without even any compiler-enabled guardrails that get re-written every 18-24 months but \"this time we&#x27;ll do it right.\" reply jakelazaroff 17 hours agorootparentI think the true lesson here is that if you fundamentally dislike a programming paradigm, then everything written in it looks like a big ball of mud. reply ttfkam 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s completely true. A concede the point. reply satvikpendem 16 hours agorootparentprevBased on your profile and comments, it seems you have some particular grudge against React, so I&#x27;m not sure I can convince you of anything React related that you have not already convinced yourself of. Nevertheless, I (nor you, it seems) have not used Svelte 5 yet so I cannot judge, just that based on my, yes, personal experience, 2 way data binding based frameworks create messes. Even though you can shoot yourself in the foot in any language or framework, some are simply better at preventing it, such as C versus Rust, as I analogized. reply kikimora 15 hours agorootparentI’m not expert in Svelte or React and have been following your conversation. You stress the point that two-way data binding creates mess. I tend to agree since I did my share of desktop programming long time ago. However, I don’t see how React solves the problem fundamentally. When you combine React with Redux or hooks IMHO you get exactly the same thing. The big difference is syntax that makes it easier to reason how view would re-render in response to change. But in a large enough project I can see how this became less and less true as distant modification trigger cascades of model updates&#x2F;reducers&#x2F;hooks and result in an unexpected behavior. reply no_wizard 18 hours agorootparentprevI always found observables need better nomenclature.I know its not anyones fault (RxJS is amazing), but it does seem to invoke some gray area in the brain, thinking observables would do more heavy lifting around change tracking of inputs &#x2F; sources, when its not that straightforward. They more rightly should be called SubscriptionStreams maybeI think its always been somewhat poorly named, based on how often I&#x27;ve had to explain the concept to other developers. reply throwaway46281 18 hours agorootparentHuh? It&#x27;s called observable because it can be observed (that&#x27;s what \"-able\" means). If it were actually meant to observe something (as you say), it would have been named \"observer.\" But it&#x27;s not - it&#x27;s the callback that&#x27;s the observer.Also observables are more like streams than arrays. reply no_wizard 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m entirely out of band to say there could be a better way of naming them, like why not call them SubscribableStream.Saying its an observable invokes a messy gray area in people&#x27;s brains. I know this because I&#x27;ve had to explain observables to co-workers more times than I can count in my career (I&#x27;m a big fan of RxJS, I didn&#x27;t mean what I said as a dismissal), and I like them for async work vs promises in many many cases, but the nomenclature does not invoke easy understanding reply cassepipe 18 hours agorootparentMaybe it would be easier for you (and your colleagues) if the function to \"observe\" observables was called... observe, instead of \"subscribe ? reply no_wizard 17 hours agorootparentnot particularly, I think it would make it more confusing.When I break it down to folks explaining its stream processing over iterables or async work and you subscribe (and can unsubscribe) a pipeline that runs over that stream, people get it quickly.When I say you can \"observe a stream\" people start getting other connotations, for some reason. I have ran into this over and over and over. Smart people too, not talking about just juniors here reply troupo 13 hours agorootparentprevBecause RxJS made at least one huge mistake: it made its observables lazy.When does it start? How do you deal with oversubscription? Late starts? Double subscriptions?On top of that streams are always a pain in the butt to debug.The fifteen million obtuse methods&#x2F;operators didn&#x27;t help either (I see there are significantly fewer now).And to remind you: it took the author of RxJava several months to understand the programming model: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dmitriid&#x2F;status&#x2F;811561007504093184 reply cassepipe 18 hours agorootparentprevIndeed !`observers` do exist in RxJs by the way: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rxjs.dev&#x2F;guide&#x2F;observer reply WorldMaker 11 hours agorootparentprevI think it is definitely a learning curve thing: when teaching&#x2F;learning Observables it can help to use a name like EventStreams or PushStreams. (An RxJS \"competitor\" is named XStream for this among other reasons.) Observable is a simple English word and the meaning of the English word is complicatedly \"shadowed\" by what the tech means by it.On the other hand, on the other side of the learning curve, Observable is a great name. It&#x27;s a simple English word that you can say and write a million times (and you will need to when working with them) without extra PascalCase or things like that. Also, when you look at the overall \"family\" that Observables fit into, it is a name that fits the family: Iterable&#x2F;AsyncIterable (\"PullStreams\") versus Observable (\"PushStreams\"). (In .NET LINQ the family uses Enumerable&#x2F;AsyncEnumerable and also extends to Queryable and the strangely named but makes sense in context Qbservable. [QueryableObservable; often pronounced like \"cube-servable\".]) As a family of tools that all generally work well together and are essentially related in a \"four quadrant\" way, it helps that they all have a nice -able names that sound related. reply klaussilveira 18 hours agorootparentprevQt was always right. reply lolinder 19 hours agoparentprevYes, the API is very similar to Vue&#x27;s. $state is ref&#x2F;reactive, $derived is computed, $effect is watch&#x2F;watchEffect.> why React was made in the first place, to have only one way data binding and to re-render the entire page in a smart wayThis last part is why Vue and now Svelte didn&#x27;t adopt React&#x27;s model. Yes, reactivity and two-way data binding give you enough rope to thoroughly hang yourself, but it also gives you a very explicit picture of how and when components will update. React, on the other hand, expects you to trust its smart algorithms, which definitely removes a lot of the pain from day-to-day coding but also makes troubleshooting performance problems harder.I see the distinction as similar to GC languages vs something like Rust: if all you need is to have an app that does a job and you don&#x27;t care about how it does it, React is a good choice. If you need to have control over exactly what will update and when, Vue&#x27;s model gives you fine-grained control over updates that&#x27;s hard to achieve in React.EDIT: And with that in mind, it&#x27;s obvious why Svelte, which prides itself on being lean and fast, would avoid the React smart-but-complicated runtime model in favor of the Vue model. reply hajile 18 hours agorootparentReact is the pragmatic answer.Most devs are of average talent and will hang themselves and everyone else with the stateful webs they weave. Even with careful PR reviews, these things have a way of sneaking in and becoming permanent hinderances.Performance hasn&#x27;t been a dealbreaker in most JS apps for years now. What HAS been a problem is getting good code out the door as fast as business needs. MOST React code is disposable based on the whims of the company.

To resolve these, you have to spend time optimizing data flow and preventing unnecessary re-renders, and it can be really difficult to trace where an update originally comes from. Svelte and other reactive frameworks give you good performance by default, so it&#x27;s very unlikely you ever have to do this in the first place. reply james2doyle 12 hours agorootparentI agree with you on this.I never had to deal with `useMemo` and `useCallback` equivalents in Vue apps.

The amount of different Button implementations alone is astounding reply eropple 16 hours agorootparentI agree on both points. I used to quite like Redux but, between NextJS simplifying the page model and hooks&#x2F;context being a lot easier for CRA-style apps, I just don&#x27;t need them anymore for the sort of things I do.The real kick to the shins is that React Server Components did a number on most component libraries, too. I&#x27;ve been forced to go to Tailwind (and DaisyUI, which is pretty nice) just so my stuff doesn&#x27;t require &#x27;use client&#x27; all over the place. The end result will be way better, it already is when you actually can get there, but right now it&#x27;s annoying and awkward. reply WorldMaker 11 hours agorootparentThat was something that React Server Components definitely got backwards. The default state of the world before RSC was client components.

By combining it with an appropriate hook you can almost obtain the effect of a state manager like redux. There are limits to this however; being just a way to pass props it doesn&#x27;t give you any fine control over reactivity reply satvikpendem 4 hours agorootparentYes, that is indeed what the article I linked says. reply bafe 14 hours agorootparentprevI just write my first fairly complex react app. As a mostly backend&#x2F;tool Dev with good knowledge of functional programming I agree with this. I could solve almost any problem using hooks + context and memo. I briefly considered using Redux but I quickly realised that a few changes in certain components would take care of most of my state management problems reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentprevReact is honestly how I used to write my code in jQuery too, for some pages that had a lot of state. Basically, just like in game dev, I had a render() function that I&#x27;d call at the end of the file that would re-render everything. The pattern itself is very easy to understand, re-rendering efficiently is the hard part, but for React users today, that&#x27;s an implementation detail.Hooks are also very interesting, they&#x27;re basically functions that run at specific times, or that is to say, they&#x27;re `f(...parameters, state)`. They hold state inside the function, sort of like a closure. reply bafe 14 hours agorootparentIndeed, seeing hooks as closures helped me to understand how they are use for state management. It&#x27;s really a \"poor man&#x27;s object\" with all the advantages of FP in terms of reasoning about state changes, lack of side effects etc. reply truetraveller 9 hours agorootparentprevSame here. For complex UIs, I almost always had my own &#x27;render()&#x27; function. reply softfalcon 18 hours agorootparentprevI mostly agree with you.Unfortunately, many React apps use Relay (another Meta product) and it opens up a world of “magic” that is sometimes a real pain to reason about. reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"many?\" While I like Relay, I&#x27;ve almost never seen Relay used in the wild. It&#x27;s sad as it&#x27;s quite an elegant concept; just as you define your props for your React component, you define your \"props\" coming from the server as well, through the GraphQL notation. I&#x27;ve been looking at ways to combine both concepts so that there is no client- or server-side state at all, it&#x27;s all just state, from a cache that determines whether to refetch from the server or to keep the state local. reply softfalcon 12 hours agorootparentMaybe it&#x27;s isolated to me and my work here on this repo:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coralproject&#x2F;talkI agree that Relay CAN be simple, but it isn&#x27;t for what we do.

Svelte is cool, but it has the key flaw that the more Svelte you write, the more compiled code appears - generally, Svelte compiles to a size somewhat larger than the original source file.For Svelte as an \"island\" tool (i.e. for building islands of interactivity in otherwise static pages, like, say, graphs for the New York Times), that&#x27;s not a problem, because the extra generated code is made up for by the lack of a bulky runtime dependency. But if you scale that up to complicated SPAs - which has been Vue&#x27;s main stomping ground - you can end up shipping larger files with Svelte than with other small frameworks.That said, SFCs in Vue are an ideal source for compile-time compilation, and my understanding is that they&#x27;re heading more down the route of SolidJS. SolidJS has a similar goal of using a compile step for optimisation, but it leans on its signals library implementation much more heavily, which means the compiled code tends to be much smaller, but you also need to include a runtime. (In practice, there&#x27;s not much size difference between Svelte and SolidJS at all, but it shows itself at the more extreme ends of very small components and very large apps.)Vue already has a runtime that&#x27;s very similar in some ways to Solid&#x27;s (read: it&#x27;s all signals, baby), so adopting the rendering ideas from there is an obvious next step. That should drastically speed up rendering, as well as reducing bundle sizes significantly. They&#x27;ve already demoed this a bit, but I think it&#x27;s not fully released yet - they gave a name for the new system, but I&#x27;ve forgotten what it&#x27;s called. reply rich_harris 12 hours agorootparent> the more Svelte you write, the more compiled code appears - generally, Svelte compiles to a size somewhat larger than the original source file.This is one of those things that&#x27;s more of a problem in theory than in practice, but nevertheless it&#x27;s worth mentioning that Svelte 5 output is _much_ smaller than Svelte 4 output. reply MrJohz 4 hours agorootparentI assume that the Svelte 5 output is smaller because more stuff is being handled internally by signals, rather than the compiled output. Does that mean that the shared \"runtime\" code is larger, or have you just managed to shrink everything down here?I&#x27;m very impressed by this stuff - I&#x27;m still not sold on the implicit reactivity, but I&#x27;m really excited about the pressure this is putting on the ecosystem as a whole and where that&#x27;s going to go. reply jddj 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly what I was looking for, cheers.Looks like early experiments were called Vue &#x27;vapor&#x27; reply berkle4455 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat is the difference between $derived&#x2F;computed and $effect&#x2F;watch? reply lolinder 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about in Svelte, but in Vue watch is for taking some sort of action when things change, while computed is meant to return a value. reply skrebbel 19 hours agoparentprevI recently took Solid for a spin and I found none of that 2-way data binding mess you complain about. To be fair, I think you’re assuming is has behavior that it doesn’t.Eg if a form input changes, that change triggers an onChange and in a handler function, you can let the change just flow through the data layer (ie through a signal or a store, which is just a hierarchy of signals). This then updates the input, but it already had that value so nothing happens. It’s pretty much the unidirectional loop that React people love to talk about. reply satvikpendem 19 hours agorootparentSorry, I should have been more clear, I was talking more about Vue and Svelte rather than Solid, which explicitly says they don&#x27;t have 2-way binding due to learning about how dangerous it is and how React doesn&#x27;t have it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solidjs.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;faq#why-can-i-not-just-assign... reply preommr 19 hours agorootparentThese discussions are so tiring.React has as much two way binding as vue - in vue v-model is just syntactic sugar for setting up event listeners and setting the value on an input element.Per the docs [0]BecomesIt&#x27;s such a small thing that it&#x27;s crazy it&#x27;s being discussed this much.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuejs.org&#x2F;guide&#x2F;components&#x2F;v-model.html reply nsonha 9 hours agorootparentReact has no data binding at all, let alone 2 ways. reply mmmeff 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat you’re talking about is unidirectional data binding, and what you’re replying to specifically mentions its failure to scale with complex applications.It’s not the kind of problem you can appreciate when taking any framework for a spin with a form input. reply skrebbel 17 hours agorootparentNo, what I replied to said that about 2-way data binding.

I keep up to date on changes to these other frameworks but in my work we&#x27;ve never run into React performance issues that couldn&#x27;t be fixed by approaching things with good principals. Signals are brought up in convo every now and then as an approach to fix an issue, but stepping back we always seem to find a better solution but just re-writing bad React code. I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re on a certain scale of users or extremely custom UI you could run into circumstances where signals would help you, but for our system that serves hundreds of thousands a day, we don&#x27;t need them yet. reply synergy20 18 hours agorootparentprevsecond this, plus its mature ecosystem, which is very valuable for the long term.though, the SSR madness movement including React concerns me, everyone tries to mix CSR and SSR into one now, which makes things way more complex than it needs. reply softfalcon 18 hours agorootparentI could not agree more. There is a huge push to make both side of the rendering “the same”. Next.js is pushing it really hard for their edge level rehydration.I get it, it gives you flexibility to hydrate the view as close to the user, as late as possible. That sounds cool, but I wonder how many folks really use it and how much you pay for not clearly defining where and when each bit is happening. reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentAs someone who tries to limit their client-side JS usage through uBlock&#x2F;uMatrix, websites that aren&#x27;t just blankwith JS disabled would be nice to see, which is why I like React Server Components. Of course, if it&#x27;s a useful enough web app, I&#x27;ll enable JS, but if someone&#x27;s writing a blog, ecommerce site, or really any site that may not require a full blown SPA. Sending minimal unneeded JS to the client is best, as it saves bandwidth and battery, as well as feeling faster due to loading faster, in my opinion. reply softfalcon 12 hours agorootparentI agree with you. It seems wasteful to spending a whole \"wait around period\" for thatto eventually load once the js gets around to it.I also agree that server components make a lot of sense to solve this problem. It&#x27;s the obvious optimization (and in some ways, a good re-learning from past wins with PHP, Ruby, etc).I also still feel we have a long way to go before it becomes elegant and obvious how all this is working. It hasn&#x27;t become standard in the way that everyone easily groks the concept of how it all works and expects it everywhere on every web stack.Still waiting to see if we go down another rabbit hole of complexity, or see more cautious and careful improvements towards an easier, more maintainable environment. reply pcthrowaway 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can also achieve this with Astro, which will render your React islands statically and also enable client-side JS for interactivity &#x2F; progressive enhancement when the client has JS enabled reply satvikpendem 16 hours agorootparentTrue, however it&#x27;s wrapped up in a nice DX in NextJS. In Astro, if I have multiple components that need React interactivity, are they all separate React apps basically? Or are they the same but with different roots? In NextJS, they&#x27;re the same and Next can intelligently figure out which to render server side and which to render client side. reply pcthrowaway 16 hours agorootparentIf I understand correctly, the React runtime is shared between islands (and you can share state between them if necessary), but they&#x27;re also pre-rendered for their initial state at build-time.So you can&#x27;t do as much in Astro as you can in Next.js, but it will definitely scratch the itch of compile-time rendering. replybrigadier132 17 hours agorootparentprevThe \"ecosystem\" is taking vanilla js libraries that work without modification in other frameworks and making them work with react via a wrapper.

Just as a shark, dolphin, and ichthyosaur all have the same body shape which is efficient for swimming and hunting in the water, so too do technologies converge when the problems are all the same and the solutions are understood, only as humans we can learn from each other rather than randomly mutating our codebases [1]. It&#x27;s the same reason why we see a lot of languages starting to adopt more functional features such as not using `null` and having exhaustive pattern matching, such as Rust (from OCaml), Dart 3, recent versions of Java, etc.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Convergent_evolution[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genetic_programming reply dleeftink 18 hours agorootparentBut for every similar shaped organism, there exist as many, if not more dissimilar ones, either alive or preceding. Convergence is not a given, and for every instance of convergence there are just as many divergences, even when appearing similar on the surface. For each degree of software &#x27;carcinization&#x27; [1], I&#x27;d contend there are as many evolutionary offshoots going against the grain.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carcinisation reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true, but perhaps just like in biological evolution, the ones that are against the grain don&#x27;t survive, for whatever reason. So it could even be that convergence occurs via selection. reply hajile 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not convergence, it&#x27;s the cycle of development patterns. Patterns come and go leaving bad memories that become anecdotes. Anecdotes become \"misunderstanding the paradigm\" and even the misunderstandings are long forgotten when the pattern that made them comes into vogue again. reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentI wonder if it&#x27;s due to how new people are to the industry, as well as how new the industry itself is. In disciplines like mechanical or chemical engineering, you don&#x27;t see nearly this much reinvention of the same patterns. I imagine most people these days using React, Vue, Svelte, or Solid have never even used jQuery or Knockout, as those are almost 15 years or older at this point. reply hajile 18 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re an engineer, physics are always there to smack you in the face. As a result, engineers collect sets of things that physics seem to be fine with and reuse them. If engineering were programming, a woodpecker in Central Park would bring down the Eiffel Tower.Programming is not physical. It is generally bound by Turing completeness, the halting problem, 2 generals problem, and the like, but most developers don&#x27;t even write code on that level. That leaves them with an infinite number of ways to solve problems with the real limiting factor often being the humans instead of the fundamental limits. If you use 5 different design patterns in 5 different frameworks, they all still work, so now you must decide (based on ever-changing factors) which one is actually the best.Complicating this is the issue that not all people were taught the same or think the same way either, so an approach that makes sense to some people might not make sense to other people. The extremes here based on education and what you learned first are massive even when there are objectively better answers too. An entire generation of devs either retired or died rather than move from assembly to Fortran or C. That generation retired or died rather than move to OOP and the OOP people are retiring&#x2F;dying rather than moving on to more functional approaches to programming. reply satvikpendem 18 hours agorootparentIndeed, design patterns in physics and chemistry is a matter of the laws of nature, one cannot try something that doesn&#x27;t follow such laws. In software, design patterns are simply guidelines, as there are no laws of nature in the realm of virtual space. It reminds me of mathematics but even mathematics has its own laws to follow, so software is even more unconstrained. reply LapsangGuzzler 19 hours agorootparentprevI think this somewhat inevitable given the flexibility of javascript. The lack of convergence on one single paradigm as a long-lasting set of best practices speaks to all of things that a web framework needs to have in order to accommodate all developers.In Svelte&#x27;s case, it feels like they went as far as they could without directly addressing observables until they reached a point where it became one of the largest features that had yet to be addressed.Open source frameworks, not unlike companies, need to continue attracting new users to grow the ecosystem, which means pleasing an ever-growing user base. reply ttfkam 17 hours agorootparentSvelte Stores are observables, just without the extra boilerplate. reply jjtheblunt 18 hours agorootparentprev> reserving directionautocorrect style typo, i think reply WuxiFingerHold 17 hours agoparentprevArchitecture and the used reactivity mechanics are different things.You need architecture to avoid a big ball of mud or spaghetti code.

My hope is a certain coding style will be the path forward, and not a new version of putting shouldComponentUpdate (and others) all over the place. reply unconed 18 hours agoparentprevIndeed. You can get all the main benefits of two-way binding in a one-way dataflow system like React by using cursors... i.e. whenever you access a property `state.foo.bar`, also derive the setter&#x2F;updater, `setBar(…)`.With proper memoization, this is both fast and ergonomic, and it even allows you to turn mutations into data and pass them to a server.

Runes are magic compiler symbols, but they look even more like just normal code than was the case before. Previously, Svelte’s reactivity model was very easy to understand, including its limitations, because it was the result of very simple analysis—you can cover the rules in a few minutes without difficulty. It included some things that were obviously magic: $: reactive blocks and $ prefixes on stores.When you had this: let count = 0; count += 1;… it made reasonable sense, because that’s just normal JavaScript; the fact that `count` was made reactive was basically incidental.But once it’s this: let count = $state(0); count += 1;This looks like you’ve called a function named $state, and given that you’re talking about migrating from compile-time to runtime reactivity, you might (I think reasonably) expect `count` then to be some object, not just an integer, and so `+= 1` would be the wrong (since JavaScript doesn’t let you overload those operators). But no, it’s instead some kind of decorator&#x2F;annotation.Yes, stores are unwieldy as you scale them up, and definitely have some practical problems, but that createCounter stuff looks fragile. I’m curious how it all works, because it looks like it’d be needing to do quite a lot of control flow analysis, but not curious enough to investigate at this time. But my intuitions suggest it’s probably markedly more complex and difficult to explain, though perhaps and hopefully more consistent. reply rich_harris 19 hours agoparent> it looks like it’d be needing to do quite a lot of control flow analysisImplementation-wise, this is vastly simpler than Svelte 4, because everything is explicit.One thing we didn&#x27;t really show today is how this works in your editor in practice — for example, TypeScript thinks `$state` and `$derived` are just the identity function. It makes sense when you use it, but I appreciate that I&#x27;m basically asking you to just trust me on that!> Previously, Svelte’s reactivity model was very easy to understand, including its limitations, because it was the result of very simple analysisI totally understand what you&#x27;re saying. But in fact the analysis is _anything but_ simple — in places it&#x27;s frighteningly complicated, to the point that even I sometimes don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on! And that&#x27;s part of the problem — because Svelte 4 is more implicit, you can&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening in a lot of cases, you just have to hope that the compiler knows what it&#x27;s doing. reply eyelidlessness 18 hours agorootparent> for example, TypeScript thinks `$state` and `$derived` are just the identity functionThat seems like a missed opportunity on Svelte’s part… but hard to fault, because TypeScript doesn’t support nominal primitive types very well. Ideally it would be something like Reactive to signal (ha) that it’s not just a plain value. reply rich_harris 17 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;ve toyed with this idea. There&#x27;s a couple of problems though. Firstly, if you have this...type Reactive = T; function $state(value: T): Reactive...then TypeScript will &#x27;unwrap&#x27; the type anyway, unless you do funky stuff like this...type Reactive = T & { [uniquesymbol]: any };...in which case things like `value += 1` will cause type errors because it coercies `value` from `Reactive` to `number`.But it also creates problems here:let message = $state(&#x27;hello&#x27;); obj = { message };The type of `obj.message` is Reactive, but it&#x27;s _not_ reactive — it&#x27;s a non-reactive snapshot of the value when the object was created.It&#x27;s possible that we can do some fun stuff with TypeScript plugins, but we haven&#x27;t dived too deeply into it yet. reply eyelidlessness 16 hours agorootparent> TypeScript will &#x27;unwrap&#x27; the type anyway, unless you do funky stuff like this […] in which case things like `value += 1` will cause type errors because it coercies `value` from `Reactive` to `number`.Yeah. I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit trying to find a nice solution to this, and I’ve ultimately arrived at “it needs type system support to work for the general case”. I think you can make your brand (symbol) optional to address this case, but it doesn’t address this:> The type of `obj.message` is Reactive, but it&#x27;s _not_ reactive — it&#x27;s a non-reactive snapshot of the value when the object was created.And here is the real problem: the types are right (in this case)! It’s Svelte that is wrong (in that it deviates from the JavaScript language semantics, which TypeScript has correctly modeled).This leads to my other ultimate conclusion with nominal primitive types: most of the time you’re better off just boxing the value… unless, or until, it becomes problematic for other reasons (eg performance, which would probably be a concern here, albeit one worth testing). Boxing allows correct, refined typing; it makes semantics of the value clear. The only downside is convenience… but this sort of convenience is exactly the kind of thing people rightly judge about the JS ecosystem.I’m not likely to use Svelte (for a variety of other reasons), so I don’t have a particular dog in this race… but I will say I find more explicit types for signals a great deal nicer to work with. Whether the explicit mechanism is a function call (like Solid) or an accessor (like many others). reply jamincan 16 hours agorootparentprevWith Rust, mutable variables are underlined by RustAnalyzer by default - it would be really useful for reactive variables in Svelte to have a similar distinction. reply chrismorgan 19 hours agorootparentprevFair enough. I’ll see how things go and wish you well. For simple cases, the new will be syntactically-inferior, but it makes sense that the explicitness allows it to be more consistent.

Which is also not how other frameworks handled this in the past. reply wentin 17 hours agoprevOne of Svelte&#x27;s biggest advantages is its compiler, positioning it more as a language than just another JS framework. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, the compiler allows Svelte to define its syntax to anything they want.Given this, I&#x27;m curious: couldn&#x27;t the traditional syntax of `let counter = 0` be made to function similarly to the new let count = $state(0);? Transpile it to let count = $state(0) under the hood? If that can work technically, instead of introducing a new rune for reactivity, why not introduce a \"negative\" rune to denote non-reactive statements? This way, the change wouldn&#x27;t break existing code; it would be more of a progressive enhancement.I agree the move to unify the Svelte tag with regular js&#x2F;ts files is an improvement. It was indeed a little odd that certain syntactic sugar, like the $, would work exclusively within the Svelte and not in a js&#x2F;ts file that&#x27;s right next to it. However, from what I gather, it seems the Svelte team is aligning the Svelte script more with js&#x2F;ts, rather than bringing the js&#x2F;ts closer to Svelte&#x27;s unique syntax. This trajectory seems to be pushing Svelte towards resembling traditional JavaScript frameworks, like React. It&#x27;s a departure from Svelte&#x27;s unique strength of having a custom compiler and behaving more like a language. If every syntax in Svelte is expected to mirror its behavior in js&#x2F;ts, eventually svelte will lose all it secret sauce that made it so unique. Why can&#x27;t we add a rune into js&#x2F;ts file, a note in the beginning to tell svelte compiler that this is svelte enhanced js&#x2F;ts file, compile it like svelte script tag code?

It&#x27;s always a learning curve when you dive into the technical side of things, and I genuinely appreciate it.Given the constraints with TypeScript not being further compilable, I&#x27;ve been pondering on Svelte&#x27;s direction. Personally, I&#x27;d lean towards letting go of some of the special touches in js&#x2F;ts file if it means keeping more magic in Svelte. If we&#x27;re heading towards making Svelte syntax work exactly the same in js&#x2F;ts entirely, it feels like we might risk turning Svelte from its unique language-like identity into just another framework in the JS world.Thanks again for the insights!

You can use Mobx to declaratively describe reactive state, much like this. But it isn&#x27;t integrated into any framework - you can use it in vanilla JavaScript with no other runtime or compilation required. You define models with Mobx, then on top of that there&#x27;s mobx-react, which ties your model into React&#x27;s update APIs (essentially making render() automatically observe values, and making relevant changes trigger a re-render), or there&#x27;s mobx-vue, or mobx-svelte, or mobx-preact, etc etc. Decoupling this is super helpful - for example I&#x27;m using mobx to model raw state, computed state & reactions to changes in server side Node.js, no problem.Meanwhile, recreating the same reactive concepts independently in each library instead makes all the resulting code incompatible, so even your pure JS state models are coupled to your UI framework - e.g. createCounter in this post has to import & use $state from Svelte. That makes it far harder to change frameworks in future, hard to share code between apps using different frameworks (plausibly even different versions of the same framework), etc etc.I&#x27;d love to see a native common standard for this, similar to how promises were eventually standarized and suddenly everything had a compatible model for handling async future results (I could swear I&#x27;ve seen initial discussion on exactly that already, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere now sadly). reply gabeidx 18 hours agoparentYou may be thinking of the ECMAScript Observable proposal: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-observable reply pier25 17 hours agoparentprevI loved MobX.

Updating&#x2F;writing state might be more complex, speak to the implementation, but seeing things change should have a semi-standard api. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-async-iterator-helpersOne huge sadness I have is that when you have a callback in .then or .next, your handler doesn&#x27;t get a gratis reference to what you were listening to. I&#x27;d love to have this be a better record. DOM is so good about having thick events that say what happened, and it&#x27;s so helpful, sets such a rich base, but js snubbed that path & left passing data in 100% to each event producer to decide as it will. Consumers can craft closures to seal some data into their handlers but it sucks compared to having an extensible data flow system. We&#x27;re kind of sort of finally fixing this crime the hard way by standardizing async context&#x2F;async_hooks, which is a whole new ambient way to create context that we can enrich our async events with, since there was no first class object to extend for having omitted passing in the promise to the promise handler. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-async-contextAlso worth pointing out, maybe arguable as a hazard tale, observables was proposed a long long time ago. There&#x27;s still a ton of adoption. But it also feels extremely similar yet notably apart & worse ergonomics than async iteration. It&#x27;s imo a good thing it didn&#x27;t get formalized. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-observableAlas one reactivity I really wish we had had is object.observe (note: different API than observables), or something like it. Undoing good specification work & saying, &#x27;yeah, if users want it, they can implement it themselves with proxies&#x27; has lead to no one doing it. And you can&#x27;t just observe anything; whomever is the producer has to up front make the decision ahead of time for all consumers, which turned a great capability into something first boutique then quickly forgotten. Alas! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esdiscuss.org&#x2F;topic&#x2F;an-update-on-object-observeI ack your ask, and there&#x27;s no shortage of options that are pretty damned good.

Isn&#x27;t it better if let count is reactive by defaultActually, it was Svelte who coined the term and sold us on the idea of reactivity by default. I don’t think anybody asked for “Reactivity by default”. Svelte advanced this idea, and it helped the framework gain traction. It was easy to get started, and gave Svelte this sense of better ergonomics than other frameworks. I was always skeptical about the performance claims, amortized, and the real selling point of Svelte was ergonomics and the dev experience.The problem with the Node.js ecosystem is the devs are borderline marketing and sales type. They’ll justify, rationalize and make things sound good after the fact. Previously, Svelte was persuading us that Svelte was better than the rest because of reactivity by default. Now they did a literal 180. It’s probably in the right direction, and maybe how things should have been. A related symptom of the Node.js ecosystem is reinventing and rediscovering the wheel. The problem here is a lost of trust. Anything else which Svelte purports it’s got figured out or is more enlightened about should be taken with a grain of salt.So it seems those boring FANG engineers with React has it right all along.

Is there a mechanism where Svelte knows which element is mutated, and do fine-grained recomputation&#x2F;update only the corresponding view elements?This is the primary place where we have to go outside the framework in React. Only a large linear list has this problem -- if it was a decently balanced component tree, then we could skip updating huge swathes of it by skipping at a top level node. But it is not possible in an array. You have it iterate through each element and do a shallow comparison to see if the references have changed.That said, it is fairly easy to escape to DOM from inside a React component with useRef and the portal pattern. Then we can write vanilla JS which makes updates to only the values it changes.If Svelte solves this in an elegant manner, then it would be a very compelling feature over React. I&#x27;m asking here because last I checked, most of the examples in Svelte&#x27;s documentation pointed to simple counters and regular objects, and I couldn&#x27;t find an example of a large linear list. reply rich_harris 19 hours agoparentYep! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte-5-preview.vercel.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;fine-grained-reacti... reply jasim 18 hours agorootparentThank you! reply nicoburns 18 hours agoparentprevDid you try setting the `key` property in React? reply jasim 18 hours agorootparent`key` informs React of the identity of an element. That helps it during the reconciliation phase -- if it knows only one `key` in a list of DOM elements has changed, then it will run the DOM updates only on that one. Similarly if the order has changed, it only needs to move its index in the parent DOM element.But it doesn&#x27;t help in the rendering phase - aka when the virtual DOM is constructed when `render` is called on the root component, and all our JSX code is executed across the component hierarchy. Virtual DOM reconciliation cost is only a part of the performance penalty, re-running the \"view as a function of state\" computation is another major chunk. reply handsaway 19 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve dabbled with Svelte and find it pleasant to use and I think this is a step in the right direction. The main reason I ultimately keep coming back to React is I find the compile-time alterations to the semantics of my code difficult to reason about.I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time building an intuition for how Javascript code executes and how I can combine its primitives to make reasonable abstractions. The fact that this _looks_ like Javascript but suddenly operates differently is almost more confusing to me than if Svelte was just a non-Javascript language.React&#x27;s `useState`, `useMemo`, etc. are perhaps more verbose but they&#x27;re just functions. Dependency arrays are messy but it&#x27;s fairly easy to extrapolate their behavior from a basic description. reply Dnguyen 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been trying Svelte for the last couple of months. At first the claim was that it&#x27;s not complicated like React because there&#x27;s a lot less concepts to learn. And it&#x27;s just using basic Javascript and CSS so those skill sets are transferable to any other job. As I use it more and more, there&#x27;s more and more special way of doing things I have to learn: store, reactive variable, $, $$, etc. I didn&#x27;t mind, sure I&#x27;m in Svelte&#x27;s world. But the number of libraries is limited and it really slowed me down tremendously. Now with runes, it&#x27;s just more \"magic\" to learn. I think that&#x27;s the last straw for me. I&#x27;m done with Svelte experiment. Back to React land. reply rich_harris 18 hours agoparentDid you read the bit about how runes make all those things unnecessary in future? reply orpheansodality 14 hours agorootparentthere are so many comments here that really feel like they didn&#x27;t read any part of the announcement other than that there&#x27;s a thing called runes.For me personally I tried svelte in the past and bounced off because there was too much implicitly happening that I needed to have a deep understanding of to model correctly. This solves basically all those problems for me.I thought your video[1] especially did a great job walking through the pros this change brings. Thanks for all your great work on this!1.

And I did notice the hard work you put into runes to make things better. My point is that, it feels like I&#x27;m just trading one complexity for another. Like most people, I am constantly searching for ways to do my job better. reply FireInsight 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d argue that there are way more libraries, since vanilla JS libraries integrate beautifully, unlike in React. Unless you are only talking about component libraries, of course. reply Dnguyen 13 hours agorootparentYes, UI component libraries. I just want to leave the UX to the expert and get going on the rest of the application. reply meiraleal 14 hours agoparentprevThat is exactly my experience after trying svelte&#x2F;sveltekit for 2 months. Loved svelte at first sight but soon their own invented complexity (and a very confusing error log) made me realize that I was changing React for something quite similar (with a bunch of different problems). In place of going back to React tho, I tried the next one in my list: Lit. No regrets, found the (powerful) simplicity I was looking for. Give it a try before getting back to React: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lit.dev&#x2F; reply epmatsw 19 hours agoprevThis looks like it’s moving closer to React Hooks, but using the compile step to optimize them out? Kinda like a better React Forget? reply pevey 19 hours agoparentThis might be the impression on first glance because it uses the word \"state.\" But keep reading, and its much more akin to what Solid is doing. In fact, the new docs openly credit the work Solid&#x27;s team is doing. They also credit Knockout&#x27;s approach form way back in 2010. reply pcthrowaway 17 hours agorootparentUnder the hood it&#x27;s doing something more similar to solid, but the API exposed is a step in the direction of React (it doesn&#x27;t expose the signals to the user). It&#x27;s not quite React either because there&#x27;s no &#x27;setter&#x27;, just a different way to opt in to reactivity which also (IIUC) makes it possible in .js&#x2F;.ts files reply davedx 19 hours agoparentprevFor sure. Look at this Svelte 5 example: let time = $state(new Date().toLocaleTimeString()); $effect(() => { const timer = setInterval(() => { time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString(); }, 1000); return () => clearInterval(timer); }); Current time: {time} reply onsclom 15 hours agorootparentThis example is a bit strange to me. I wonder if `$effect` will actually replace all usage of `onMount` and `onDestroy` for Svelte. In Solid you could totally do these things with `useEffect` too, but they chose to keep `onMount` and `onDestroy` (which they call `onCleanup`) to make this kind of thing more simple.Example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solidjs.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;counter`onMount` and `onDestroy` feel like really useful, dependable callbacks. `$effect` is scary because if you add a reference to state in it, you can&#x27;t depend on it being called like `onMount`. reply madacol 1 hour agorootparentThey don&#x27;t claim they&#x27;ll remove `onMount`.They claim most (but not all) of current usage of `onMount` will be better off using `$effect` instead reply harrygeez 19 hours agoparentprevI kind of feel the same. React and all the new stuff now feels like unnecessary complexity but they definitely got the initial DX right reply cornfutes 18 hours agorootparentThe fact that the frameworks are converging on the same idea should suggest that it is necessary complexity in the framework for any sufficiently complex app. reply meiraleal 14 hours agorootparentOr that they are too invested to drop features in place of adding more? When this happens, incumbent frameworks appear. Svelte was one but it became just like the old ones before its prime time. reply bhouston 19 hours agoparentprevIt looks so close to react hooks, that is the first thing that struck me. Of course the syntax is slightly different but functional it is mostly the same. It seems weird that we are definitely converging between the various frameworks. For a while with svelte I though we were diverging but that seems to be changing now. reply pier25 19 hours agoprevThis makes a lot of sense and will simplify some confusions around reactivity.I&#x27;m guessing runes will make it easier for the compiler to track the reactivity which will enable stuff like automatic partial hydration? Maybe even something like qwik?I only read the blog post and didn&#x27;t watch the video... was there any mention on perf and size improvements? reply benmccann 18 hours agoparentReactivity is faster now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Rich_Harris&#x2F;status&#x2F;1688581184018583558And the output from the compiler is much smaller. You can compare the output on the Svelte 4 REPL to the output on the Svelte 4 REPL. The runtime has grown a bit, but the output overall is still much smaller even when factoring that in reply kevinak 19 hours agoparentprevSmaller and faster :) reply pier25 18 hours agorootparentCan&#x27;t wait to see some numbers! reply hinkley 19 hours agoprevSo if I’m understanding this, Svelte is moving from reactive by default to declarative reactivity? That does seem like an improvement in signal to noise ratio.Shared-everything does not scale. It ends in whack-a-mole and an escalating blame game about whether team members are fit to work on the project. It’s bunk. It’s deflecting from the real problem which was dereliction of duty by the “architects” who took a laissez-faire stance on state management instead of providing structure. Worked on a couple of those. Never again.Practically the whole point of encapsulation is gated access to data, putting constraints on sharing, compressing the possible state space of the system closer to the desired state space. reply onsclom 15 hours agoprevMost of this I really love. One thing seems a bit strange though...Let&#x27;s compare Svelte&#x27;s and Solid&#x27;s approach to nested reactivity. Both of them implement the same nested reactivity todo example:Svelte: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte-5-preview.vercel.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;fine-grained-reacti...Solid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solidjs.com&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;stores_nested_reactivity?so...In Solid, converting something to use nested reactivity is one step. In Svelte, it is two steps. And that second step is really verbose and annoying: todos = [...todos, { get done() { return done }, set done(value) { done = value }, get text() { return text }, set text(value) { text = value } }];Solid makes read and write segregation very simple and obvious. You don&#x27;t need to manually make all these getters and setters.It is nice that runes allows nested reactivity in Svelte, but it feels nicer to use in Solid. reply keb_ 12 hours agoparentThis is the biggest weirdness that I hope gets addressed. reply wirahx 19 hours agoprevI&#x27;ll be the first to mourn the (future) loss of $: but the video clearly shows that the changes are a pretty enticing way to make your code that little bit cleaner, and solve all of the \"but Redux!\" style questions.Svelte for Apps.

I also like the compiler optimizations that Svelte is bringing to the entire ecosystem.I wrote my initial thoughts on sveltekit when I built neovimcraft: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bower.sh&#x2F;my-experience-with-svelte-kit reply rich_harris 19 hours agorootparentAs we&#x27;ve taken to saying around the virtual Svelte offices:> The magic of Svelte isn&#x27;t `let count = 0`, it&#x27;s `count += 1`That part hasn&#x27;t changed! reply bowsamic 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah I gotta agree. No comment on runes but $: was so weird that I was immediately confused at why I would try and use svelte for anything reply orangepanda 19 hours agoprevReact Hooks has its problems, but it got so many things right from the start - code written in 2018, when hooks first came out, still works today.

What I meant was, developers want to use the latest and greatest. Hooks added in 2018 havent changed, there’s no replacement api for them - it’s still modern code.They got the DX right from the start, that other libraries are still trying to emulate. reply Raed667 18 hours agorootparentthat&#x27;s one thing I admired about the React team back then, they took the time to think about how things \"should\" work long term. The functional&#x2F;hooks release was criticised as people liked their class components, but time has shown that hooks were the correct decision.I feel they lost that as people gradually rotated out of the team, around the time they announced concurrent-mode, now suspense and the half baked RSC \"release\". reply nicoburns 18 hours agorootparentYeah, I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about concurrent mode. People have been trying to implement something like this since ~2010, and I haven&#x27;t seen it done well yet. reply Rapzid 18 hours agorootparentprev> Component re-rendered because hook 16 updated.DX Amaze. reply troupo 13 hours agorootparentprev> They got the DX right from the start, that other libraries are still trying to emulate.The DX isn&#x27;t \"right\". It&#x27;s just the one they are sticking to. There are many issues with the actual developer experience when it comes to hooks in React.So it&#x27;s a good thing that other frameworks are iterating and finding new and possibly improved ways of doing things. E.g. neither Svelte nor Solid require dependency arrays to effects or other reactive primitives. Their effects work everywhere, and not just inside component code. You&#x27;re not beholden to the order and number of effects, unlike with hooks. Etc. reply Heechul 5 hours agoprevI feel weird that runes are being used in `.js` files without explicit imports. This means some `.js` files without runes can still be interpreted independently without being compiled, but some `.js` files with using runes will not (how do I tell my editor to not warn about these runes while still being `.js&#x2F;.ts` files?) . For components, using `.svelte` instead of something like `.jsx` allowed avoiding this kind of issue. What would be a good solution to this? Would explicit imports fix this issue? reply codelikeawolf 2 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a lot of comments here so I may be asking a question that was already answered, but will the runes be explicitly importable in non-Svelte files? Or does it use an approach similar to testing frameworks like Jest and Vitest where you have access to them as globals? I&#x27;m thinking of the implications for TypeScript. I usually opt out of globals and import explicitly when I can. reply bluelightning2k 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve always respected Rich Harris and the Svelte team.They do an excellent job of some pretty substantial tech. But also the way he&#x2F;they explain it is so powerful.That includes the blog posts, the videos, the framework itself and the playground.This does seem like a unifying step. Seems like (at least) Svelte and Angular have both declared this model superior to their existing implementations. The video gave credit to prior art in general but would have been better to give the specific projects credit - not just ethically but also to be explicit about what is and is not similar. reply spencerchubb 17 hours agoprevThe whole selling point of Svelte was that it was simple, like a breath of fresh air. You could update the state of your component just by assigning a variable. I guess this is the natural progression of web frameworks. reply onsclom 13 hours agoparentTo be fair, assignments to variables still update the state of your component. `count += 1` will still update the state of your component. I think what you meant is that you now need to explicitly declare `count` as state. Personally, I think the magic of Svelte is that assignment part. And now the magic of Svelte works across files and even inside regular `.ts` and `.js` files! reply 4kimov 19 hours agoprevHaving moved from React to Svelte, it was always a breath of fresh air to write less and have it just work.

More recently, signals have been popularised by Solid and adopted by a multitude of other frameworks.> We&#x27;re doing things a bit differently though. In Svelte 5, signals are an under-the-hood implementation detail rather than something you interact with directly.That&#x27;s a sad development and further makes the framework more complect (as defined by Rich Hickey), with more hidden layers and \"magic\". reply tambourine_man 19 hours agoparentprevI’m still waiting for every other framework to realize that jQuery was right all along.But if these guys are only now reaching Knockout, I still have to wait for them to catch up to Backbone.js, I guess. reply paavohtl 19 hours agorootparentjQuery is not a framework by any definition of the word.

These days, { uBlock Origin, Vimium } is all I need :) reply notpushkin 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a nice approach! I try to maintain a practical balance here, my extension list is basically: GreaseMonkey, Stylus, uBlock Origin, Consent-o-Matic, Dark Reader and maybe a couple more.In theory, one can use uBlock0 for everything (with CSS and I think also JS injection), but userstyles and userscripts are way easier to use sometimes. And you can reimplement Dark Reader with userstyles, but you&#x27;ll have to keep track of various site-specific tweaks to make it look good. (Should be possible though! Might be a cool idea for a pet project.)But I understand the concerns with having too many extensions from too many different authors, yeah. reply mig4ng 14 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing.

I&#x27;d suggest everyone to view the original project website [2], it has a ton of amazing real world challenging experiments.It was a community favorite for the Best Paper Award at the R:SS conference [3], this year. I remember our lab (and all other learning labs in our robotics department), absolutely dissecting this paper. I know of people who&#x27;ve entirely pivoted away from their projects involving behavior cloning&#x2F;imitation learning, to this approach, which deals with multi-modal action spaces much more naturally than the aforementioned approaches.Prof. Song is an absolute rockstar in robotics right now, with several wonderful approaches that scale elegantly to the real world, including IRP [4] (which won Best Paper at R:SS 2022), FlingBot [5], Scaling Up Distilling Down [6] and much more. I recommend checking out her lab website too.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.04137[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu&#x2F;[3] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboticsconference.org&#x2F;program&#x2F;awards&#x2F;[4] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;irp.cs.columbia.edu&#x2F;[5] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flingbot.cs.columbia.edu&#x2F;[6] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.columbia.edu&#x2F;~huy&#x2F;scalingup&#x2F; reply yellow_lead 4 hours agoparentTo be fair, they do credit Professor Song and the paper you linked.

Is that big round squishy thing in the videos sort of like a big finger, with lots of pressure sensors? People have built area pressure sensors before, as far back as the 1980s, but nobody knew what to do with all that data back then. Today, too much sensor data is far less of a problem.I once took a crack at this problem by equipping a robot arm with an end wrench. The idea was that it would feel around for a bolt head, get the wrench onto it, and turn. A 6 DOF force sensor is enough for that. But this was pre deep learning, and I didn&#x27;t get very far. although I did build the wrench robot setup.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37167698 reply v9v 3 hours agoparentThe squishy thing is essentially an inflated balloon with a camera inside, which monitors the balloon&#x27;s deformations: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;punyo.tech reply Animats 3 hours agorootparentNice.

It takes a lot of trial and error, but in general if the task is constrained you can solve it reliably. The trick is to solve *new* tasks without resorting to all that fine tuning every time. Which is what Russ is claiming here. He’s training an LLM with a corpus of one-off policies for solving specific manipulation tasks, and claiming to get robust ad hoc policies from it for previously unsolved tasks.If this actually works, it’s pretty important. But that’s the core claim: that he can solve ad hoc tasks without training or hand tuning. reply dotancohen 2 hours agorootparentnext [–]> He’s training an LLM with a corpus of one-off policies for solving specific manipulation tasks, and claiming to get robust ad hoc policies from it for previously unsolved tasks.It seems clear that many people do not understand that this is the key breakthrough: solving arbitrary tasks after learning previous, unrelated tasks.In my opinion that really is a good definition of intelligence, and puts this technique at the forefront of machine intelligence. reply steve_adams_86 10 hours agorootparentprevIs the pancake and spatula problem actually that constrained though?I know it isn’t as open ended as plenty of more important problems in robotics, but this doesn’t strike me as easy at all.I’ve only dabbled in robotics as an entry level hobbiest, so I really don’t know the answer. reply GlenTheMachine 9 hours agorootparentIt’s constrained enough to be tractable. reply steve_adams_86 9 hours agorootparentFair enough. When would you say it stops being tractable? What single, practical thing could we add to this problem to make intractable? reply xyzzy123 6 hours agorootparentFlipping a pancake in a \"random kitchen\" would be much more difficult and have many of the same issues as the door problem.It&#x27;s hard to point to a single thing that would make \"flipping pancakes\" intractable, it&#x27;s sort of the other way around, to usefully flip pancakes in the same way as a person takes a lot of skills chained together.The \"door problem\" is a sort of compendium of many real-world skills, identifying the door, understanding its affordances and how to grip &#x2F; manipulate them, whether to push or pull the door, predicting the trajectory of the door when opened, estimating the mass of the door and applying the right amount of force, understanding if there any springs or pulls on the door and how it must be held to traverse through it. Etc. There are also a ton of things I&#x27;m missing that are so fundamental one tends to take them for granted, like knowing your own size and that you can&#x27;t fit through a tiny doorway.I think you can ramp towards the \"door problem\" in difficulty by slowly relaxing constraints. A video linked above (not article) shows \"can flip a pancake successfully with a particular pan (you are already holding) and pancake with a fixed camera and visual markers\". Ok, now do it in varying lighting conditions. With no visual markers. With different camera views. Different pancakes. Real pancakes (which are not rigid, and sometimes stick to the pan). Different pans. Now you have to pick up the pan. Use a stove. Different stoves. Identify griddle vs pan and use the right flipping technique. Find everything and do it all in a messy kitchen... eventually you&#x27;re getting to same ballpark as the \"door problem\". reply ziofill 3 hours agorootparentphysicist here (so very naive on these topics) - I’m wondering how to compare the steps you mention regarding the door problem (especially the predictive ones, e.g. about the trajectory of the door as it opens, etc) with how humans open doors? Surely people don’t stop in front of a door and begin planning things out, rather they seem to go for it and adjust on the fly, is this an approach that won’t work in robotics? Why not? reply xyzzy123 2 hours agorootparentSo classical robotics yeah, people used to write code for each step of opening a door. Practically speaking you would probably not do motion planning on the door, you would just code it up with a bunch of heuristics like, try to be over here in relation to the doorframe because that&#x27;s a good opening spot and will probably work. Ok you&#x27;re in the right place? Now, move gripper towards the door handle... etc. Bunch of hacks. Put enough hacks together and you can kinda sorta open (some) doors. Oh this is a SLIDING door? Damn we forgot to code for that...The way things are going is sensors (cameras, force, etc) and neural networks. You let the robot try a bunch of ways of opening doors, sometimes it doors itself in the face, eventually it&#x27;ll figure out good places to stand based on what the door looks like. The more doors you make it try to open hopefully the better it gets at generalising over the task of opening doors. The hacks&#x2F;heuristics are really still there but the robot is supposed to learn them.> Surely people don’t stop in front of a door and begin planning things out, rather they seem to go for it and adjust on the fly, is this an approach that won’t work in robotics? Why not?Yeah, figuring out how to do this is basically \"the problem\". Most people don&#x27;t have a sense or feeling of \"planning things out\" as they open a door because we reached \"unconscious competence\" at that task. We definitely have predictions of what is going to happen as we start opening the door based on prior experience and our observations so far. If reality diverges from our expectations we will experience surprise, make some new predictions, take actions to resolve the surprise, etc.Not sure that anyone has ever studied how people open doors in detail, it&#x27;d be interesting. I bet there are a ton of subtle micro behaviours. One that I know is, if you hear kids running in the house it is a good idea to keep a foot planted in front of you as you approach the door, because those guys will absolutely fling or crash doors open right into your face. reply dclowd9901 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes you think a kitchen would have to be random? We regularly design physical spaces to accommodate robots. reply xyzzy123 3 hours agorootparentI was responding to address why the \"door problem\" is more difficult than \"pancake flipping under controlled conditions\".(I also ignored that door opening is generally done by mobile robots of a certain weight class which tend to be more expensive than a stationary arm with enough strength to pick up a spatula or hold a pan).There is a steep difficulty gradient from \"works in the lab\" to \"works under semi-controlled real world conditions\" to \"works in uncontrolled real-world situations\". replyirtefa 15 hours agoparentprevYes! In layman&#x27;s terms: is the most efficient way to train these robots by showing them billions of videos of how it&#x27;s done? reply GlenTheMachine 12 hours agorootparentAlmost certainly not. Because the sense of touch is an important part of the problem and that data isn’t present in videos. reply hinkley 11 hours agorootparentNot just touch but proprioception. Robots in human environments will have to be better at proprioception than 98% of humans. If I bump into you it’s typically anything from annoying to a meetcute. I’m a pretty big guy, but if you had to chose me to step on your foot or somebody else, it’s probably me you want, because I will shift my weight off your foot before you even know what happened (tai chi) because you will barely notice.If instead your choice is your high school bully or a robot, well for now pick the bully. Because that robot isn’t even being vicious and will hurt more. reply ekidd 6 hours agorootparent> Because that robot isn’t even being vicious and will hurt more.Rodney Brooks at the MIT AI Lab was a big advocate of something called \"series elastic actuators.\" The idea was was that you didn&#x27;t allow motors to directly turn robot joints. Instead, all motors acted through some kind of elastic. And the robots could also measure how much resistance they encountered and back off.MIT had a number of demos of robots that played nicely around fragile humans. I remember video of a grad student stopping a robot arm with their head.Now, using series elastic actuators will sacrifice some amount of speed or precision. You wouldn&#x27;t want to do it for industrial robots. And of course, robots also tend to be heavy and made of metal, so even if they move gently, they still pose real risks.But real progress has been made on these problems. reply hinkley 4 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re probably right, and those non-linear systems are going to make me have to increase my estimate for how long it takes for a robot to go from 5 year old child to ninja physicality.

This is how I see it playing out:- You have your Boston Dynamics style humanoid robot at the job site, lets say it&#x27;s a bricklayer for the purposes of this example.- You have a human somewhere offsite in an open room with an omnidirectional treadmill floor, and cameras and depth sensors positioned all around the room. They&#x27;re wearing a Hollywood style motion capture suit and have a VR headset on so they can see what the humanoid robot sees through their cameras.- The human then acts as they would on site, walking up to the pile of bricks, picking them up, placing them etc. The robot moves in real time on the job site, mimicking whatever action the human performs. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll need props to do this properly or if the muscle memory from years on the job will be enough for the humans to get the motions right.- You log all the data. You then have someone watch through the video stream, labelling each action that is being performed.- You run it all through a machine learning algorithm, until you get to the point where you can just send the architectural plan to the robot and essentially say \"Build this wall for me\". reply 0xbeefcab 13 hours agoparentThe first 3&#x2F;4 points were all almost exactly from the 2008 movie Sleep Dealer to the point where I thought you were referencing that reply rcarr 13 hours agorootparentNever heard of it before, any good? reply jmugan 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worth watching because it is so plausible. reply fallat 7 hours agorootparentCommenting for myself later :D. reply fragmede 4 hours agorootparentthere&#x27;s a favorites feature that might interest you. replytshaddox 13 hours agoparentprevAnd yet, as far as I know we don&#x27;t even have mature implementations of this even for machines with much courser movement whose movement are controlled by a loose physical mapping to the human operator&#x27;s movements.

People who want more than the essentials (a house with larger bedrooms, equipment for their hobbies, travel accommodations) can find paid work in positions that still require a human touch.And if there aren&#x27;t enough jobs available for everyone who wants one, then start reducing the standard work week from 40 hours, until everyone who wants can find work. reply randomdata 11 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m leaning more towards socialized housing, food, health care, and public transporation now, at least for the basics.What&#x27;s the difference between that and UBI? The state giving the people a magical ticket to redeem for food and shelter or simply giving them food and shelter is the same thing at the end of the day.Both are equally prone to be inflationary as they require workers to provide the food and shelter without receiving anything real in return. In both cases you need to seize real value from the wealthy population if you want to avoid the inflationary effects.It&#x27;s the same thing, just different accounting. reply reissbaker 10 hours agorootparentIn practice I think giving a stipend to buy shelter is less useful than providing shelter directly in our current political system where large amounts of local regulatory control have been captured by existing landowners — so more money in doesn&#x27;t mean more production of housing. For example, it&#x27;s illegal to build significant new housing in most of San Francisco, and NYC zoning and planning restrictions mean that the city has built less housing in the past decade than it built during the Great Depression, despite vastly more money being spent.There&#x27;s also the tough tradeoff that money is useful for more than just food and shelter, and so there&#x27;s high incentive for unscrupulous people to try to get you to transfer it to them instead of covering your basic needs: for example, by spending millions on advertising campaigns to get you to stretch yourself to buy things you don&#x27;t need; or just regular, transparently illegal things like extortion, selling addictive drugs, etc. It&#x27;s not that people are dumb, it&#x27;s that other people have incentive to try to get you to do things that are bad for you but good for them, if you have money. If you have shelter that can&#x27;t be transferred, there&#x27;s just a lot less incentive to try to abuse you.Not that money is bad, just if we&#x27;re trying to run an efficient program that covers basic needs (but not much else), directly providing the things we want to provide is IMO likely to be more efficient than cash transfers and unaccountably hoping that the cash is spent on what the package is aiming to provide. reply SanderNL 1 hour agorootparentprevI have the real unpopular opinion that some psychological pressure is necessary for human societies to operate somewhat optimally.Straight up giving people money is different from living \"on stamps\".

With UBI, people are also putting that money back in the private sectors. With socialized meal programs, the government lean on the wealthy to ensure everyone has access to food, and uses that to employ people in the public sector.> Both are equally prone to be inflationary as they require workers to provide the food and shelter without receiving anything real in return.I&#x27;m not sure I follow why this would be inflationary, but it&#x27;s also not what I was suggesting.Even if this does lead to more inflation though, it ensures the government is responsible for securing food and housing for everyone, rather than something like UBI which might result in people who can&#x27;t find work not actually being able to afford the essentials. reply VirusNewbie 6 hours agorootparentprevIf I&#x27;m a landlord and everyone gets an extra 2k a month guess how much i&#x27;m going to increase my rent next month? reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 9 hours agorootparentprevThat system will just make people in charge of distributing socialized housing, food and health care very rich. reply james4k 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re describing the current system. reply midoridensha 3 hours agorootparentprev>I&#x27;m leaning more towards socialized housing, food, health care, and public transporation now, at least for the basics.The problem with this is that these are all limited resources. That&#x27;s the whole reason we invented money: to control access to limited resources. If you have free housing for everyone, who decides who gets a luxury penthouse apartment, and who lives on a 20 m^2 apartment on the 1st floor? Not everyone can live in the penthouse, and there&#x27;s not enough room for everyone to have a 300 m^2 apartment without making the city sprawling. Same with food: some food costs a lot more to make than others. Same with healthcare: while arguably everyone should get basic care and emergency care, should we give free plastic surgery to everyone who wants it? Money lets people decide what&#x27;s more important to them. reply pcthrowaway 1 hour agorootparentI suspect you didn&#x27;t read the rest of what I wrote.Subsistence housing and food is by definition not luxury. No one who receives social housing is getting the penthouse suite. Luxury is still pay to play. The government would just provide modest housing and food. Maybe the food is Soylent. Maybe the housing is a studio apartment or a tiny home.I agree that these are limited resources, but in theory there should be enough housing and food for everyone to survive, and if there isn&#x27;t, making it a social responsibility can hopefully catalyze action to change that.

We want less of that as it is, not more.Working doesn&#x27;t just mean \"working for the man\", it can be anything productive that results in income. Such as making and selling paintings, music, whatever.However, there cannot be a reality where choosing to not work rewards you with as much or more than those who actually work. We also cannot have a system where people choose to peruse fruitless endeavors simply because they enjoy them, and then still get government payments. Yet, the system you propose will be just that - \"I need it more because I&#x27;m poor - I&#x27;m poor because I choose not to work\".The money used to pay these people is complex, but it is not \"free\" and is largely supported by the working class. We cannot build incentives for the working class to stop working and subsist entirely off government payments (which come from the rest of the working class, leading to a downward spiral for any such program in terms of costs to the nation).So realistically, the numbers for some sort of UBI are far, far greater than most people admit in these debates (as all-things government tend to be).Additionally, if the tax equals the original labor, then there is now a negative incentive for businesses to adopt technology and replace employees as well. Employees are more flexible than a robot, for instance, so if costs are equal the human is the better value from the perspective of most businesses (some excluded such as maybe manufacturing). reply kube-system 12 hours agorootparentNo, the labor participation rate in the US is less than 2&#x2F;3 already, because people like children, retirees, and the disabled exist. Distributing money to people who would lose jobs to automation would never be a per-capita exercise, anywhere. reply Alupis 12 hours agorootparentYou miss the point. The system you propose builds an incentive for more people to not work, not less.Your system falls apart if more and more people decide not doing anything at all is a worthy trade off for a reduction in annual salary. reply kube-system 12 hours agorootparentYes, in today&#x27;s labor market it would.But that&#x27;s not the scenario that is being entertained here.We&#x27;re talking about a hypothetical future world in which robots with AGI are capable of performing basic labor. Incentivize a human all you want, they will never be able to compete in a labor pool where their competition has no rights and will work 24&#x2F;7.That being said, a handout is not the best way to use that money anyway.

It&#x27;s a staggering amount, but I don&#x27;t see why you would exaggerate like this.I&#x27;m actually pretty sure if you raised the income tax rate for the top 0.1% and closed corporate tax loopholes, you could get that level of money. reply Alupis 13 hours agorootparentThe poverty line? reply alexb_ 13 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthcare.gov&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;federal-poverty-level-fp... reply Alupis 13 hours agorootparentSo you are saying we&#x27;re going to doom an entire population to poverty, provided courtesy of the government?I know you&#x27;re trying to make a point, but let&#x27;s be realistic.

The loss of a formerly-leading and user-friendly game engine to the darker forces that negatively impact so much of the gaming industry has left us dismayed to put it mildly. While we do not personally use Unity outside of a few elements on our console/mobile platforms), we feel like we cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere. We unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget. We do not feel that a simple public statement is sufficient. Even if Unity were to recant their policies and statements, the destruction of trust is not so easily repaired. We strongly feel that it is now equally important to get behind some of the other up-and-coming open source game engines. Lighting some candles in an otherwise dark moment. To that end, we are donating $100,000 to each of the open source engines listed below. Additionally, we are sponsoring each of these projects with $1,000/month each moving forward. All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere. Godot Logo FNA Logo Re-Logic has always been supportive of game developers and indie studios that do things the right way. We feel that our actions in this moment are the best way to carry that mission forward - by accelerating and strengthening competing open source game engines, we hope to empower and assist studios that are struggling with how best to proceed given these recent events. @blazeknave@lemmy.world English 8 • 8 hours ago Good 508 compliance bot @ipkpjersi@lemmy.ml English 76 • 13 hours ago What an incredibly kind move by the Terraria developers.

They’re still doing free updates AND they can afford a $200k donation? @Skrinkus@sh.itjust.works English 11 • 8 hours ago You know they’re legit when my nephew just built a PC and is excited to finally play terraria. @funnystuff97@lemmy.world English 175 • 16 hours ago Terraria is like the anti-modern game. They absolutely refuse to evilly monetize their game at all. The playerbase is almost on their knees, begging them to move on from Terraria and make something else (not because Terraria is bad, but they’ve been at it for over a decade!) and they continue to churn out updates. The fanbase voted for a set of features to appear in Terraria 2, which they then turned around and scrapped, and added it as an update to Terraria. And all their updates are always free. And can’t forget about their amazing mod support. And redigit is just, like, the man. spriteblood 43 • 15 hours ago Also their game is literally $10 USD on Steam, compared to all the $70 ones that have been coming out lately. @rustyricotta@lemmy.ml English 19 • 14 hours ago And regularly on sale for $5. @laylawashere44@lemmy.blahaj.zone English 3 • 12 hours ago Tbf it takes a significantly smaller team to develop a 2d platforming game like terraria. The overhead for art and design is mush simpler too than something like a Cyberpunk 2077 @scv@discuss.online English 12 • 11 hours ago Also Terraria is a lot of fun and more replayable than most $70 games. DopamineDeficient English 69 • 7 hours ago The playerbase is almost on their knees, begging them to move on from Terraria and make something else (not because Terraria is bad, but they’ve been at it for over a decade!) and they continue to churn out updates dont worry, im sure update 1.4.5 will be the final final final final final final final update, and then they will move on. @darthelmet@lemmy.world English 9 • 12 hours ago They’ll stop updating the game whenever the Attack on Titan anime actually ends. Peachfacedshredder English 7 • 12 hours ago *whenever One Piece is found @AngryCommieKender@lemmy.world English 13 • 14 hours ago Terraria update 2.0 expected release date 1E128 years @ipkpjersi@lemmy.ml English 6 • 13 hours ago I love how they keep saying they will have a final update, and then they just keep updating it regardless. It’s really impressive. @TheMadnessKing@lemdro.id English 13 • 14 hours ago I don’t game at all, but I now feel like buying the game just to show my support to these awesome devs. @Shush@reddthat.com English 9 • 13 hours ago Same. I do game, just games like Terraria aren’t my taste, but I’ll still buy the game on my accounts to show my support to them. @PM_ME_FEET_PICS@sh.itjust.works English 50 • 14 hours ago They came out around peak indie craze, 14 or so years ago. I believe they were just behind Minecraft in terms of success. Total lifetime sales for their game have it outselling Skyrim. @chic_luke@lemmy.world English 45 • 14 hours ago It’s time to dust off Terraria and go on a nice run again. Edit: I will, of course, be first in line to buy any new games they release. They donated $100k to a FOSS project I use and love, thus to me as well indirectly, I can give some of my disposable income back to then. @stephenc@lemmy.world English 23 • 14 hours ago One of the, if not the best games in the last 15+ years. I’m not exaggerating. At all. I am not a fan of a vast majority of “popular” modern games and think gaming has been on the decline since the mid-90s. In a massive pile of garbage “AAA” and “modern indie” titles, Terraria is the one shining, beautiful, wonderful spot that just gets gameplay right, with no gimmicks, no BS, no boring intrusive story, nothing but good, solid gameplay. It’s one of my favorite games of all time. So all this makes me very happy. @cjsolx@lemmy.world English 19 • 14 hours ago Out of curiosity can you define “no boring intrusive story”? Because personally I’m big on storylines, so if they nail that part then that takes the game to a whole other level @stephenc@lemmy.world English 2 • 10 hours ago Story for me in games should be one that sets up the reason you’re playing the game and that’s basically it. No endless dialog or narrative during the game. Small bits of things that can advance the plot is fine, but most games these days seem to talk endlessly about things. Terraria has zero of that. You’re in the Terraria world and that’s it. No real story to tell besides what happens in the world (show, don’t tell). It’s fantastic. @scv@discuss.online English 2 • 11 hours ago In some games storyline matters, in others… not so much. Games with a storyline trend to be less replayable in my experience. One exception I can think of is This War of Mine, that game is really depressing. @wahming@monyet.cc English 3 • 12 hours ago Yeah, no story period. Which is good for some people, not so much for others @Zink@programming.dev English 30 • 13 hours ago No wonder Terraria is so awesome, coming from people that are so awesome. rush English 240 • 18 hours ago Common Re-Logic W Seriously though, whilst the budget they can give to Godot and FNA is small compared to what other, bigger devs/publishers could give, I find their commitment remarkable and very much in-line with their goal of empowering developers and gamers alike We need more publishers doing things like this akatsukilevi 105 • 17 hours ago Considering FNA and Godot, $100K is gonna do wonders to both projects, specially with the additional $1K They might even better afford to have developers working full-time at the engines, or deal with stuff like infrastructure, licensing, hosting and other costs rush English 26 • 15 hours ago True! Considering Godot and FNA’s current size this is indeed going to catapult them to a different league, which I guess is what Re-Logic was setting out to do :P Quokka English 12 • 10 hours ago It won’t change Godot. Epic donated $250,000 in 2020, Kefir donated $120,000 in 2021. Godot Devs started W4 games and raised $8.5m of which their goal is to support Godots growth. $100,000 is nice and will allow them to continue but it’s not “league changing” money or anything for them. @AstralPath@lemmy.ca English 118 • 17 hours ago This is how its done. I hope this sparks a FOSS revolution. @LunchEnjoyer@lemmy.world English 14 • 13 hours ago Hell yeah, love to see it! @NanoooK@sh.itjust.works English 23 • 17 hours ago Really good of them. I wish some others developers do the same, it’d be really great for the open source engines. ekZepp English 4 • 16 hours ago Unity FAIL Causes Re-Logic to Make MASSIVE Donations to Godot and FNA Video dumdum666 -104 • 16 hours ago 200k is a false number: They donated $100k and 1k per month to Godot.

Even ignoring how the results of this will determine how companies try this is the future (because they WILL), this shit is like classical Greek drama, watching someone fall because of their hubris. hook 90 • 17 hours ago Well, I like playing video games and this will affect the video games I like playing. I’m not a game developer, but if Unity got everyone to roll over with that TOS change I’m sure that devs would use this as a new justification to increase costs for games or higher subscription fees for services like Gamepass. It’s important to be invested and informed in the things that matter to you. @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -117 • 17 hours ago Yeah, but through like two to three layers of abstraction. I like beer, but I don’t give a shit about the contractual details of malt distribution. Games are still gonna be made, this is just something for people to project their impotent rage at. @Algaroth@lemmy.world English 35 • 14 hours ago Hi. I’m a brewer. You might not care about malt distribution but maybe you can understand that a lot of breweries run on small margins. If we suddenly have to pay a lot more for malt we will either have to raise our prices or go out of business. Raising prices might also drive us out of business because less people will be inclined to buy our beer. So it does affect you as a consumer, whether you care or not. @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -29 • 14 hours ago We live in a society. Everything affects the consumer, doesn’t mean I have to care about everything. Distribution of malt is your problem, not mine. @Algaroth@lemmy.world English 21 • 14 hours ago Yes. Everything affects the consumer. That’s why some consumers care about it. I don’t understand why you can’t wrap your head around that. @trashgirlfriend@lemmy.world English 16 • 14 hours ago Wow you’re so detached and cool bro… like you just don’t care. Wow bro that’s so cool of you how you don’t care about things, can I suck you off or do you not care about that either @Algaroth@lemmy.world English 8 • 14 hours ago Uh, I totally don’t care about anything either. @trashgirlfriend@lemmy.world English 3 • 12 hours ago I feel like there’s a sinister plot inside of this post. @ipkpjersi@lemmy.ml English 5 • 13 hours ago Except it becomes your problem if beer suddenly starts getting priced higher and higher and higher over time to the point where you can’t afford it anymore? @lobut@lemmy.ca English 62 • 17 hours ago I’m not a game dev but I’m a dev so I can easily see how this can affect them. If you’re uninterested that’s fine, no need to insult those that do. @shortypig English 46 • 16 hours ago Well shit. Some people actually care about the people who produce whatever it is you consume. It’s crazy, I know. If the people who are growing the malt for my beer, or processing it, or delivering it, or whatever… are getting screwed over I would be equally concerned. But by all means, continue to be a consumer pacman just gobbling up whatever it is that falls in front of your face. That’s what the world is trying to mold you into anyway. Why fight it? @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -72 • 16 hours ago Oh please get over yourself. If you consume games you are already actively supporting the screwing over of people in like five different industries the world over. This price hike in one piece of software is just your “thing” to get righteously mad about this week. @histy@lemmy.world English 25 • 15 hours ago the famous contrary he doesn’t have a single opinion of his own, he doesn’t understand the subject or have any idea of the implications, he just like to be against the grain because he’s COOL! @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -25 • 15 hours ago I just set myself a timer for a month to remind me to ask you about your opinions on this topic. I’m sure you’ll still be heavily invested by then. @shortypig English 10 • 16 hours ago You’re cute. I like you. @Gray@lemmy.ca English 34 • 17 hours ago If the contractual details of malt distribution were going to affect the quality of beers you were getting then you absolutely would care. Unity’s pay scheme will lead to studios shutting down if there isn’t pushback. Studios switching to a different engine like Godot will make their games feel different for better or for worse and efforts to help fund these alternate engines will help tip the scale towards that being “for better”. But most importantly of all, this is a company using toxic and predatory practices. Regardless of the industry (yes, malt distributors too), if we don’t push back against toxic business practices, then companies in many different industries will see avenues they can take advantage of to make extra money. These ideas don’t hang in isolation. If Unity’s scheme works, other businesses will learn from it. This is the reality of capitalism. Whatever methods can turn a profit without generating negative attention will be employed. It’s in the hands of consumers, competing businesses, and the government to keep those toxic practices in check. I mean, why the fuck are we on Lemmy? Ultimately Reddit’s actions are not going to affect the majority of users on their platform. Most of us came here to protest shitty business practices. @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -69 • 16 hours ago I’m here because I’m permad on reddit. And reddit will be fine, we can stop pretending that a bunch of Linux nerds jumping ship makes a difference. @dezmd@lemmy.world English 5 • 10 hours ago Well that explains it. @nightm4re@feddit.de English 18 • 16 hours ago This is not a great comparison tbh. Unity are not distributing a resource, you could rather compare them to a company building the motor for the car you use. Even as the end customer, their product is clearly perceivable and distinguishable from competitors’ products. You don’t need to build cars to have an opinion on Unity motors and the ethics of their business. And if they fuck every contractor over and abuse their power in the market to retroactively charge additional fees for every time someone starts a car with their motor in it, of course you would be directly hit with the consequences as a customer. Therefore, it is justified to not leave this discussion to car manufacturers, but to 1. let unity motors know that they can go fuck themselves and 2. to support more ethical motor manufacturers in the future by buying cars built with them. TulipanJones 19 • 17 hours ago I like coffee, but I prefer to source my beans from places I can trust. People lost trust in Unity so they ain’t gonna use the engine anymore. Blown out of proportion? Yeah maybe, but I agree with the core concept @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -62 • 17 hours ago Yeah but YOU consume the beans. The only difference the engine makes is the logo on startup. @sirfancy@lemmy.world English 36 • 16 hours ago …what. He just made an analogy about not consuming unethical beans. That’s literally his point. So no, he does not consume the beans. @Retro_Unlimited@infosec.pub English 21 • 14 hours ago I read today that about half the games are made with unity, imagine if most of those pulled the games you purchased so it can’t be installed again. That is a huge hit to gaming. @PM_ME_FEET_PICS@sh.itjust.works English 13 • 14 hours ago 7 Days to Die, Escape from Tarkov, Wasteland 2, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Cities: Skylines, Dungeons 3, Cult of the Lamb, Endless Space 1 and 2, Outerwilds, @GCostanzaStepOnMe@feddit.de English -37 • 14 hours ago Well they obviously won’t. It’s always the same with these things, they either come to terms, or the producers will pay up, or the reports are overblown or whatever. Just like reddit didn’t lose half its userbase after the API switch, or Youtube doesn’t crumble because everyone throws a fit when they add another commercial slot and swears to move to “pipetube” or whatever (lol). But thank god we’re all really really invested in something that is essentially corporate politics. @ipkpjersi@lemmy.ml English 14 • 13 hours ago It’s not corporate politics if it’s going to have an effect on the end users. You’d be surprised at how big of an impact this will have, if they don’t backpedal this and cancel it entirely, and even if they do it could still an impact. sebinspace English 16 • 13 hours ago Stop feeding the dipshit.

I am actually very interested in something like that. reply Rapzid 3 hours agorootparentYes it&#x27;s here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;godotengine&#x2F;godot&#x2F;pull&#x2F;72883 .Looks like it lost a little momentum in the past few weeks but it&#x27;s working for people and there is a path forward to getting accepted by maintainers. It&#x27;s also on the DotNet contributors meeting agenda for tomorrow.. reply livrem 3 hours agorootparentThere are many mentions of C# there, but it is just a C library that can be embedded without involving C#, right? reply Rapzid 3 hours agorootparentYes, I think someone who first started pushing for it was interested in embedding it in their C# app as the entry.But it&#x27;s just an .so that can be used in any app through the C ABI I gather. reply malermeister 2 hours agoparentprevOooh I wonder if this libgodot would also allow me to work with Kotlin&#x2F;Native.

These MBA beancounter types get attracted to public companies like flies to a pile of bull dung because it&#x27;s far easier to get compensation tied to stock prices&#x2F;valuation there, and it&#x27;s easy to direct a stock&#x27;s price upward (headcount reduction is the most common thing that will send it upwards). reply drumhead 2 hours agorootparentprevThey do it because it succeeds.

Shine a very bad light at unity.A unity splash screen is and always was a sign that the game might won&#x27;t work on my setup.Maybe this will drive away all these shitty games. That&#x27;s definitely mostly just good for the brand, but IMO kinda necessary as the brand stands for shitty games for some. reply hackerlight 3 hours agoparentprevI can&#x27;t fathom the logic. Why not do a slice of revenue like Unreal does, and calibrate the percentage so you make the same amount of money as you would have otherwise made had you done it per-install? Happier customers and identical revenue. reply ffgjgf1 45 minutes agorootparent> slice of revenue like Unreal does,China (and some other countries). They won’t declare their full revenue and you won’t be able to find it out, it’s expensive to admin and there is hardly any legal recourse anyway.Also their biggest clients would probably hate rev. share even more than this. reply wardedVibe 3 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s an attempt to use a small part of their revenue (unity) to coerce ad-based games to use their ad network rather than their competitors. reply alphager 3 hours agorootparentprevTheir USP was that they had no revenue share. Somehow they thought that the current retroactive per-install model would go over better than reneging on that promise. reply hutzlibu 3 hours agorootparentBut how little can you know about your own product and your customers, by suddenly treating an AAA game that is sold for a fixed big price, where a fee per install might make sense or is affordable, the same as all those little games, where many are free to play (add financed, or as a free demo with full version unlockable)?I mean, how can you not see that? Or was the thinking, screw that market, we are only catering for AAA games now? Even then it makes little sense as the revenue share like Unreal does, would make more money.It likeley was something along the lines of: \"they need us, they will have to find a way to pay us, if they want to continue existing.\" reply noirscape 2 hours agorootparentNot AAA games - the real target here is mobile games. Those far exceed any profits the AAA industry generates.Indies are a necessary casualty in the eyes of Unity (or more accurately: they&#x27;re just not considered).Unity is the engine behind some of the most popular mobile gacha games. MiHoYo (Genshin&#x2F;Honkai Impact) uses it for everything, so does Type&#x2F;Moon (Fate Grand Order). They want a slice of that pie. That&#x27;s where the real money is. Those games rake in hundreds of millions of dollars every month.Hence also why the charge is by install and can be waived if you use Unity&#x27;s adtech offerings. reply ffgjgf1 42 minutes agorootparentFor most indies prices shouldn’t really go up that much and for some others this is actually a discount (the 200k limit is now per game and not company and you already had to upgrade to pro after that).For 90-95% if not more of their users the financial aspect is not such a big deal. The way they announced it and planning to implement (retroactively and how do they even track “installs”) is a way bigger issue. reply deafpolygon 3 hours agorootparentprevIt was more a heavy-handed tactic to get small ad-supported game developers to switch to using Unity&#x27;s ad network rather than their competitors. replyhooby 3 hours agoprevI think it&#x27;s great to see increased support for open source engines.Those engines might not be at the same technical level as Unity (yet), which shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise given the way lower budget and man-power behind them. But they are getting better - and they do have some massive advantages over proprietary engines. One example for such an advantage would be that you can just fork the code, if they do something you don&#x27;t like. They can&#x27;t hold your game hostage to force changes on you. reply Leo_Germond 3 hours agoparentIMO this is not the technical level that matter, it&#x27;s the UX, if we leave aside the super duper AAA games, which would use Unreal, then it&#x27;s about putting a whole lot of different assets together, and hold them with code glue. Unity has some nice things that are not there yet in godot (from the top of my mind: better font support, in term of UX once again), and C# is way better than thw half-assed language that is Godotscript.That being said I&#x27;m pretty sure that Godot is about to close this gap before 2025, given the recent boost in popularity. reply lvncelot 2 hours agorootparentNever used Godot myself but can&#x27;t you use C# in place of Godotscript?

There also seems to be interest and discussions around how AOT can be used in the future.The engine is super easy to build and I think I actually built it with .Net 7 haha. Others are already using .Net 8. reply rcarmo 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can. There are plenty of people porting their Unity code to Godot in that way. reply gumballindie 2 hours agorootparentprev> C# is way better than thw half-assed language that is GodotscriptC# is a horrible language, but if you must use it then you can in godot. You can use c++ too. reply zigzag312 33 minutes agorootparentWhy do you think it&#x27;s a horrible language? reply globular-toast 2 hours agoparentprevWhy do I feel like those useful changes in the forks will never make it upstream? It&#x27;s not GPL I suppose? I guess I just don&#x27;t really understand how people can be ok with companies like EA freeloading their work, which they almost certainly will if they can. reply yodon 2 hours agorootparentMost open source projects have realized that GPL has unfortunate parallels with a foot gun.Forcing people to contribute sounds like a great idea, until nobody wants to be forced and everybody prefers the other project that doesn&#x27;t force them, and then they all go ahead and contribute to that other project anyway because they want to, not because they were forced to (in large part because the practical benefits of getting your changes into the upstream vastly outstrip any theoretical \"my code is better\" fantasies).Faster adoption of non-GPL projects leads to faster growth of those projects in the form of more contributions as well. Other than a group of mostly quite old GPL projects the momentum and activity and success is clearly with more MIT-like licenses than GPL-like licenses, again in large part because the benefits to you of getting your patches into the upstream proves to be a powerful motivator that is not also a demotivator the way the threat of being forced to contribute is.Yes, one can point out a newish successful GPL project here or there and a couple of pro-GPL ecosystems but the vast majority of recently successful project starters are using MIT-ish licenses for good reasons. reply TheRoque 2 hours agorootparentprevIs GPL practical for a game engine ?

I think the appeal of FNA is mostly to keep old games alive, rather than as a platform for new ones, so it feels a bit strange to see it get as much funding as Godot here.

Easy to understand, easy to get started with, truly a great onboarding experience. Additionally the ability to use C# can&#x27;t be understated as, IMO, it&#x27;s a fantastic match for game scripting... until you start to hit performance problems.Which has kind of always been the problem with Unity. Once you start getting into the meat of it there&#x27;s always some issue. Most recently their obsession with DOTS and the fragmented rendering pipelines were really off-putting and enough to get me to switch to Unreal. I also found a lot of the features barebones for a very long time, like 2D tilesets, landscape editing tools, nav mesh, animation tooling, etc. None of this matters to companies with actual teams, but for indie development I&#x27;ve found Unreal to be a much better match for me than Unity.That being said Unity has come a very long way in the recent years and the engine can be a joy to work with (as long as it&#x27;s not crashing and misbehaving, which it does). But that&#x27;s history at this point.

    "originLink": "https://jakobs.dev/solving-mnist-with-gzip/",
    "originBody": "Home - Chat with Jakob-botLinkedIn - GitHub 78% MNIST accuracy using GZIP in under 10 lines of code. September 20, 2023 Edit: brief addendum after hitting the HN frontpage; MNIST is a straightforward dataset, and higher accuracies are possible with various methods. The novelty of this post isn't aiming for state-of-the-art results, but showcasing the potential of using compression as a unique, model-free classification tool. The code golf just adds a layer of complexity for fun. We can 'solve' MNIST up to ~78% accuracy with the following code-golfed obscurity: c = lambda z: len(gzip.compress(z.tobytes())) def ncd(x, y): return (c(x + y) - min(c(x), c(y))) / max(c(x), c(y)) cls = [(x, c(x), l) for x, l in training_set] correct_predictions = sum([np.array_equal(Counter( [l for _, _, l in sorted([(ncd(x1, x), x, l) for x, _, l in cls], key=lambda t: t[0])[:5]]).most_common(1)[0][0], label) for x1, label in test_set]) If you just want to see the code sample, here is a link to the Jupyter Notebook containing the code to run this experiment. Lets dive into why and how: yesterday while in the one-hour train ride from Eindhoven to Rotterdam, I was inspired by the post text generation from data compression and the (quite controversial) paper on parameter free text classification to play around with using compression as an image classification mechanism. Previously, I worked on image compression for computer vision on the edge, so interested in applying the technique to the most seminal yet basic dataset, I attempted to use GZIP + K-NN as a classification mechanism for the MNIST (handwritten digits) dataset. Breaking down the technique, it boils down to two components: GZIP and NCD (Normalized Compression Distance) as a similarity metric, and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) for classification. In this approach, GZIP is essentially our tool which gives us a way to measure the complexity or information content of individual data points. NCD provides a normalized measure of how similar two data points are, based on how much more (or less) effort it takes to compress them together compared to compressing them separately. For each test sample, the algorithm computes its NCD with every training sample (in our case, 100 training samples), sorts them, and selects the k smallest distances. The majority class among these k=5 closest neighbors is then predicted as the label for the test sample. As this is quite computationally expensive, I only took a subset of the test images to arrive at my accuracy measure. Of course, it would be more correct to use the full set, but I leave this an an exercise to the reader ;). Here is a less obscured version of the algorithm: def compute_ncd(x1, x2): \"\"\"Compute the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) between two samples.\"\"\" Cx1 = len(gzip.compress(x1.tobytes())) Cx2 = len(gzip.compress(x2.tobytes())) Cx1x2 = len(gzip.compress((x1 + x2).tobytes())) return (Cx1x2 - min(Cx1, Cx2)) / max(Cx1, Cx2) print(\"Classifying test samples...\") k = 5 # Number of neighbors to consider correct_predictions = 0 # Counter for correct predictions actual_labels = [] predicted_labels = [] # Cache compressed lengths for training samples compressed_lengths = [(x, len(gzip.compress(x.tobytes())), label) for x, label in training_set] for (x1, actual_label) in tqdm(test_set[:100]): # Calculate NCD for each training sample distances = [(compute_ncd(x1, x), label) for x, _, label in compressed_lengths] # Get k nearest neighbors and predict label neighbors = sorted(distances, key=lambda x: x[0])[:k] top_k_class = [label for _, label in neighbors] predicted_class = Counter(top_k_class).most_common(1)[0][0] # Update predictions and counts actual_labels.append(actual_label) predicted_labels.append(predicted_class) correct_predictions += (predicted_class == actual_label) Note: after writing this post, I found this article by Andreas Kirsch taking a similar approach back in 2019. His approach reaches around 35% accuracy. Back to Home So long and thanks for all the fish. copyright Jakob Serlier 2023-2023",

The guesses I hear most often are 20-30%.People, even machine learning people, often don&#x27;t realize the rapidly diminishing returns you get for adding a lot of complexity in your models. Sometimes it&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s always good to start simple first.It&#x27;s also been my experience that if you don&#x27;t get good performance with a simple model, you are very unlikely to get great performance from a more complex one. reply nextos 16 hours agorootparentCame here to say the same thing, actually NCD can probably do much better than 78%. Li & Vitanyi&#x27;s book about Kolmogorov complexity has some interesting unsupervised examples.A simple CNN as implemented in Keras tutorial can easily exceed 98%. 78% is very poor performance for MNIST even if model complexity is penalized. reply mardifoufs 14 hours agorootparentprevWhen would a 90% accuracy on a dataset like mnist ever be useful? And I mean useful as in usable for actual products or software. especially considering mnist is more of a toy dataset.I think that&#x27;s why machine learning is the way to go for this type of detection, why go with anything else than a CNN (in this case) when it is now trivial to set up and train? Again, unless it&#x27;s just to mess around with, 90% mnist accuracy is not useful in the real world reply vannevar 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think the point was that you should use logistic regression on MNIST. In lesser-known problems, say a custom in-house model, if you don&#x27;t try the simpler approach first, you&#x27;ll never know that your more complex solution is not worth the extra expense, or is actually worse than a simpler, cheaper model. MNIST is well-known to have nearly perfect solutions at this point, but for most novel problems, the data scientist has no idea what is theoretically possible.Now, you can say that CNNs or other techniques are easily accessible these days, and almost trivial to set up. But they may not be trivial to train and run in terms of compute in the real world. reply KRAKRISMOTT 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you stack logistic regression in layers, you get a neural network. reply salty_biscuits 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can get 80ish percent with a linear model (if you one hot the labels). reply vjerancrnjak 15 hours agorootparentprevExtending existing features with their non-linear mappings would improve logistic regression too, probably to the svc level (rbf or poly kernel is that but implicit).Linear models are really well researched, and today with the compute and with proper training and data preparation they can easily get to satisfying levels of performance for a variety of tasks. reply bugglebeetle 10 hours agorootparentprev> People, even machine learning people, often don&#x27;t realize the rapidly diminishing returns you get for adding a lot of complexity in your models.Are you me?

In the article OP linked it doesn&#x27;t seem that Gzip is very good at extracting useful patterns for the MNIST dataset. reply amelius 15 hours agorootparentprevWhy? I mean it&#x27;s trivial to add a layer of encryption ...(Also the terminology seems off here, as 100% of information survives gzip.) reply minitech 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, that wasn’t the point at all.

There are good 3d datasets with more realistic examples that are still fairly simplistic compared to the state of the art large datasets, but at least give you signal that your technique is robust to common problems in vision.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Electronic Frontier Foundation About Issues Our Work Take Action Tools Donate SEARCH Today The UK Parliament Undermined The Privacy, Security, And Freedom Of All Internet Users BY JOE MULLIN SEPTEMBER 19, 2023 The U.K. Parliament has passed the Online Safety Bill (OSB), which says it will make the U.K. “the safest place” in the world to be online. In reality, the OSB will lead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users. The bill could empower the government to undermine not just the privacy and security of U.K. residents, but internet users worldwide. A Backdoor That Undermines Encryption A clause of the bill allows Ofcom, the British telecom regulator, to serve a notice requiring tech companies to scan their users–all of them–for child abuse content.This would affect even messages and files that are end-to-end encrypted to protect user privacy. As enacted, the OSB allows the government to force companies to build technology that can scan regardless of encryption–in other words, build a backdoor. These types of client-side scanning systems amount to “Bugs in Our Pockets,” and a group of leading computer security experts has reached the same conclusion as EFF–they undermine privacy and security for everyone. That’s why EFF has strongly opposed the OSB for years. It’s a basic human right to have a private conversation. This right is even more important for the most vulnerable people. If the U.K. uses its new powers to scan people’s data, lawmakers will damage the security people need to protect themselves from harassers, data thieves, authoritarian governments, and others. Paradoxically, U.K. lawmakers have created these new risks in the name of online safety. The U.K. government has made some recent statements indicating that it actually realizes that getting around end-to-end encryption isn’t compatible with protecting user privacy. But given the text of the law, neither the government’s private statements to tech companies, nor its weak public assurances, are enough to protect the human rights of British people or internet users around the world. Censorship and Age-Gating Online platforms will be expected to remove content that the U.K. government views as inappropriate for children. If they don’t, they’ll face heavy penalties. The problem is, in the U.K. as in the U.S., people do not agree about what type of content is harmful for kids. Putting that decision in the hands of government regulators will lead to politicized censorship decisions. The OSB will also lead to harmful age-verification systems. This violates fundamental principles about anonymous and simple access that has existed since the beginning of the Internet. You shouldn’t have to show your ID to get online. Age-gating systems meant to keep out kids invariably lead to adults losing their rights to private speech, and anonymous speech, which is sometimes necessary. In the coming months, we’ll be watching what type of regulations the U.K. government publishes describing how it will use these new powers to regulate the internet. If the regulators claim their right to require the creation of dangerous backdoors in encrypted services, we expect encrypted messaging services to keep their promises and withdraw from the U.K. if that nation’s government compromises their ability to protect other users.

It is almost certain that regulatory compliance will fall disproportionately on challengers. With one exception major exception, there is no indication whatsoever that they will boycott the UK because if it, nor has there been much resistance to it in public at least from big tech.

Name dropping off the top of my head: IPFS, Veilid, Dat, hypercore, maybe even Urbit (yes I know). Maybe simply not putting our entire lives on the internet.Counter-economics? Get infatuated with anarchism, the free-market variant, mutualism, read up on agorism (on my reading list is a PDF titled \"How to Opt-Out of the Technocratic State\" by Samuel E. Konkin III), understand that cryptocurrencies, with all their problems, could be the only tool to take down a capitalist system from the inside the more our rights are stripped away. People, and the market itself, do not care about laws or prohibition. For the first time in history, we have a way to exchange value that does not respect borders or physical constraints. Even mainstream economists such as Milton Friedman believed such an invention could radically reshape the world. [1]That&#x27;s an open discussion, nothing I can go over in a forum comment, and there is no panacea. I&#x27;m simply exploring the option that it might be possible to have a fairer world, while collectively we have decided this is the best we can do, and point and laugh at whoever tries to dispute that. We have lost the idealism of the thinkers of the last two centuries, those that fought tooth and nail for civil and worker rights.

Many other EU countries struggle with all of these problems(and more!) and yet manage to preserve the privacy of their citizens regardless.And I&#x27;m not saying that someone worrying about affording food and energy bills should prioritize privacy over it, but the way I see it there is apathy on all levels of the society. I have friends who are very firmly in the top 1% of the British society and they also don&#x27;t care too much about it, it&#x27;s just yet another thing that they feel doesn&#x27;t affect them so why worry about it. It&#x27;s very different feeling to the one you can get in the US or in Germany or Poland, where even people who are theoretically not affected by surveillance laws are upset about them and will be very vocal about them.Like I Said in another comment - on a personal level all I want is my friends, colleagues and family to say \"this kind of thing is unacceptable in democratic society and I don&#x27;t agree with it\" instead of \"meh I don&#x27;t care\". reply lynx23 1 hour agorootparent> Many other EU countriesThe UK is not a EU country.

The op was discussing comparing nations and used a blanket \"EU\" moniker to denote this. You know, our next door neighbours of similar economic size... reply belorn 48 minutes agorootparentprevIn order to address those political people would need to go and demonstrate and become political active in order to bring in tax reforms, banking reforms, economic reforms, social welfare reforms, government administrative reforms, school reforms, healthcare reforms, police reforms, and possible more in order to take money from other sectors to pay for it.The purpose of anti-privacy laws is to make sure that such activity is fully monitored and dealt with in proper manner before they can become a problem. The rise of new political parties is in particular important to keep in check, and that is impossible if people have private communication and unchecked travel.This why and how privacy rank above those issues. Naturally most people are not political active, and most who are do not threaten to partake or create competing political movements. reply barrysteve 15 minutes agorootparentYes, because we know in the &#x27;40s, that political groups built on disaffected men and brotherly evilness, threatened to take away the wealth and power we intend for our Sons to inherit.Nobody is going to SAY this basic truth and give disaffected men a chance to make a moral decision, instead we are going to enslave the entire planet, to ensure security and freedom for Anakin&#x27;s new Empire (lol). reply conjectures 2 hours agoparentprevIt is depressing, but is it untrue?

On the other there&#x27;s entertainment and distractions everywhere.But then there&#x27;s the endless torrent of shitty policies and noises. Take Donald Trump; one thing he did was post something outrageous on Twitter pretty much daily, so all the media outlets homed in on that, pushing less interesting but no less important things down the list of things that demand your attention. And another thing was to push far-right ideas, and keep pushing them, so that on a long enough timescale, the less extreme ideas gain more support because \"well it&#x27;s not as bad as proposed\". reply bowsamic 2 hours agoparentprevI’m British, living in Germany now, and one thing that moving here made me realise is that in the UK almost everyone, even young generations, act as if the blitz is still going on. Somehow the British psyche became mortally wounded from WW2 and hasn’t recovered since. Everything is still “keep calm and carry on”. Any attempt at having a political effect is met with dismissal or even total anger reply yakubin 45 minutes agorootparentI’m currently reading a book about the history of the British Empire and I think this temperament is older. When Australian and Kiwi troops were called to support Britain in the first World War, they were baffled by how much shit the Brits were ok with taking from their superiors, while the Brits were surprised how undisciplined and prone to protest their Australian and Kiwi counterparts were. You can look even earlier. While France at the end of the XVIIIth century had a bloody revolution, which did make some people in Britain think about their lot in life, they ended up mostly just talking things over, making some mild reforms and that’s it.So I don’t think it’s blitz. It’s an older trait of avoiding internal confrontation (which doesn’t seem to extend to the Irish who on a number of occasions throughout British history decided to either leave Britain for greener pastures, or were more willing to be a bit more aggressive). reply barrysteve 32 minutes agorootparentThe First Word War, was a British&#x2F;European war though. You bet your bottom dollar, Australians are going to protest being sent to fight in Europe (unless they like the hunt, then it&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother story).The Brits do internal confrontation, behind closed doors in private, and in negative inferences&#x2F;sarcasm&#x2F;irony in public.What Brits don&#x27;t do, is go against the establishment, which is what most foreigners bump into on day one. And brits have the concept of something being &#x27;not the done thing&#x27;.So you end up with a society that agrees on most things and has a fine line of disagreement that is invisibly negotiated...Good luck! reply tmjwid 6 minutes agorootparentMustn&#x27;t grumble is in my opinion our national motto. We do have dissidence, but is met with contempt and apathy. Look at the national outrage over just stop oil stopping some cars on the a motorway. The rage was baffling, mass psychosis just took over the nation. reply bowsamic 9 minutes agorootparentprevI agree. Also read chapter 10 of Karl Marx Capital to see what British people were willing to put up with in Victorian times reply simonbarker87 1 hour agorootparentprevInteresting take, I was having a conversation the other week where I reused a fun line from the Expeditionary Force books:“Britain: striving for mediocrity”People are run down, fed up and have no idea what to do about it because as a nation we have culturally been conditioned (over generations) to accept our lot.Striving for better (not just individually but societally) is sneered at and things going badly is shrugged at as the norm.I sometimes feel we have this idea that the the UK is feature complete. Any new infra project is protested, new initiatives to try to improve things are eye rolled at - even talking about new ideas leads to back lash.I honestly don’t think it’s some top down grand plan for control, I think it’s just incompetence, lack of leadership and fear of the above points.So yeh, heads down, carry on and hope for the best (well, hope for “not too bad” really). reply conjectures 1 hour agorootparentprevI a fellow Brit, I note that you still bring up the war! But yeah, this is true.Honestly, I don&#x27;t think we get out of this hole until demographic churn (ugly phrase yeah) rebalances the electorate.If we look at the 1992 election there&#x27;s a 13% gap in conservative votes between the youngest and oldest brackets [1].

That said, I don&#x27;t think it was any different in 2017 and I don&#x27;t discredit the trend. 2017 was also out of the ordinary as there was an actually left-wing alternative offered. reply bowsamic 7 minutes agorootparentprevI would agree but young people seem prone to it almost as much. It isn’t just voting conservatives, it goes deeper than that reply pjc50 43 minutes agorootparentprevIronically it was the post-war experience where most of Britain&#x27;s egalitarian institutions got built: state education and the NHS. \"Homes for Heroes\", a massive housebuilding program to recover from the bombing damage, including social housing owned by councils. People attribute this to the cross-class effects of the war: having a more expensive house in a better postcode wasn&#x27;t something the Luftwaffe respected.No, just as people post all those \"good thing&#x2F;bad thing\" graphs that diverge in 1971 for the US, the big political scar across the UK is the Winter of Discontent (1978&#x2F;79) and subsequent Thatcherism. Middle-class voters chose suppression of internal dissent and a retreat from social policy, up to and including effectively abandoning cities that weren&#x27;t London to their own devices. (\"Managed decline\" for Liverpool, Glasgow etc)But remember: the suppression of dissent is a popular policy. Nobody in the marginal voter class wants to think, engage, be challenged, or deal with real problems. They want to retreat into Facebook boomer nostalgia instead.There&#x27;s also another breakpoint in how the introduction of student loans and fees in the late 90s means that a large section of the middle class under 40 is much poorer and to the left - permanently, as a cohort effect, not an age effect.

Authority is, after all, an illusion. The same is true for governments.It&#x27;s why governments that want total surveillance and police states must tippie toe their way there with bills like this, or, do things in total secrecy like the NSA.

Governments don’t mind noncompliance, they need a little and if we look at legal cases involving tech companies where they are being regulated we can see that tech companies are often noncompliant.

Authoritarian regimes often force compliance even without consent.I also expect that it would take an awful lot more than regulation like this to get anyone in a western country to rise up enmasse to replace the government.

There seems to be an obvious workaround here:- It&#x27;s not illegal to supply someone with an E2E encryption tool like OpenPGP.- It&#x27;s not illegal to provide a messaging service.- The OSB seems to make it illegal to provide both of these things in a single package.So there is now a bit of friction involved for anyone who wants E2E communication in the UK, but there doesn&#x27;t have to be that much friction. You just need separate legal entities to provide you with the 2 tools involved (the encryption tool and the messaging service), and you need to keep track of your own private keys.Sure, the vast majority of people will not bother with this, but it&#x27;s really not enough friction to stop even the casually motivated; i.e. anybody involved in anything even remotely illegal.I&#x27;d applaud the implementation of a maximally convenient system like this, just to lay bare the idiocy of this law. reply kwhitefoot 2 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s not yet illegal to supply someone with an E2E encryption tool like OpenPGP.People are concentrating on the technicalities of implementation and completely missing the point that a substantial fraction of the UK population appears to think that pervasive surveillance is the solution to crime of all kinds.That it might or might not be feasible while still allowing people to have secure communications is not really relevant because there are enough people who would be quite happy for their communications to be less secure just so long as one more paedophile or protester can be brought to justice. reply PhilipRoman 33 minutes agoparentprevThis only works if the judge actually cares about what is written in the law.

The problem is basically that the major services will likely have to comply, because they do have a sizeable UK presence they&#x27;ll want to maintain, hence they will introduce anti-features that basically ruin it for everyone. And if they do comply, it gives rope for the government to go after smaller players that don&#x27;t.As a UK resident, I hope this will go the way of anti-piracy legislation - i.e. enforced against big services only while everyone else just continues to do whatever they want. reply saithound 3 hours agorootparentprevHow was Saudi law enforced on Jamal Khasogghi?

It has very little to do with where you live or what courts have \"jurisdiction\" over you.I doubt that social media execs would avoid traveling to the UK of all places in order to not piss off the handful (and I say this as a long-time EFF member) of people who really care about this law. To make things worse, major services tend to have presence in almost every country, especially the UK, and leadership tend to have personal connections and property in these places. They will just comply (as long as not offering their service in certain locations is an acceptabpe form of compliance, they might opt to do that if the financial calculus works out, but it&#x27;s not necessarily an option at all). They don&#x27;t even have to go straight to physical or financial punishment: if a service accept any kind of payment, they can get compliance by ezerting influence through various international card networks as well. If they don&#x27;t have to comply, and can keep offering their service anyway, it&#x27;s only because the UK didn&#x27;t squeeze hard enough: but they could, and if they do, there&#x27;ll be nothing your government or geographical location will do to protect you.There is no such thing as a sovereign entity \"not having jurisdiction\" over you: that would be an oxymoron, they do as they please by definition.

Photograph: handout UK security and counter-terrorism British journalist held by police at Luton airport for five hours without arrest Matt Broomfield, who has worked in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria, had his phone and laptop seized when he was questioned last month Dan Sabbagh Defence editor Wed 20 Sep 2023 12.55 BST A British freelance journalist who previously worked in the Kurdish-controlled part of Syria was held by counter-terrorism police at Luton airport for five hours without being arrested last month under controversial powers of detention. Matt Broomfield, 29, said he was met by police as he got off a plane from Belgrade with his girlfriend on 24 August and was taken aside for questioning, where he was asked “do you consider your reporting objective” and his opinions of the British state. Police told Broomfield they were engaged in “a mopping up operation”. They seized his phone and laptop and have since refused to return them. After the questioning ended, he was allowed to proceed and no police action has followed. Broomfield was detained under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, used routinely by counter-terrorism officers to question people at airports for up to six hours at a time. Police say it is a tool to keep the public safe, but critics say the power is overused to the point of harassment. The National Union of Journalists has written on Broomfield’s behalf to Matt Jukes, the policing lead for counter-terrorism, to ask for a justification for his detainment in the absence of criminal proceedings, and for his computer and phone to be immediately returned. Officers focused on Broomfield’s writing, much of which is sympathetic to the Kurds, and a three-year period ending in 2020 when he ran a news and information service in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria. “They asked who I had met and interviewed,” he said. Broomfield was held for two months in Greek migrant detention centres in 2021 after being denied permission to cross the border into Italy. He was told he was banned from the EU’s Schengen area at the request of Germany, which he believes was because of his media and advocacy work. He was flown to the UK where he was subjected to a schedule 7 stop. After that, Broomfield, who is now based in Belgrade, says he was allowed to re-enter the UK “several times” without issue – until the latest stop last month. Kurdish soldiers were instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State in north-east Syria in 2019, with air support from the US and UK, and remain in effect in control of the region. Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurds, who aspire to their own state based on territory in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Broomfield said: “It seems clear the Schengen ban and my harassment by the UK police are driven by direct or indirect pressure from Turkey, on the basis of my work and reporting in Rojava and around the Kurdish issue.” He said the UK should have no interest “in the anti-democratic prosecution of legitimate journalism”. British Kurds told the Guardian they were routinely stopped under schedule 7. Ali Gul Ozbek, 58, a pharmacist from Friern Barnet, north London, and a former mayor of Haringey council, said he had been stopped every time he went abroad since around 2012, both on the way out and on the way back. The most recent stop was in July when Ozbek, a British citizen, went to visit his uncle in Geneva, Switzerland. “It is a form of torture. They ask the most basic questions that could be answered by a primary school student. I am an ordinary Kurd, I do not have any link with any Kurdish political organisations.” Official figures show 2,498 people were stopped under schedule 7 powers in the year to 30 June, down 6% from a year before. The detainees are a wide range of people, including those with the loosest of links to the Kurdish movement. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Davies, who trains medical students, believes she was stopped because “I sympathise with the Kurdish cause in a general sense” and because she was involved in organising a Kurdish cultural event in Cardiff last November. Police took her DNA and photograph; her phone and Kindle were searched before she was allowed to leave. The Home Office said schedule 7 enabled officers to stop, question, detain and search a person to determine whether they are or have been involved in terrorism. “Examinations have been instrumental in securing evidence to convict,” a spokesperson said. Iida Kayhko, a doctoral researcher in security studies at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the belief in the British Kurdish community was that UK police were reflecting pressure from Ankara after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s election victory in May, which has reinforced Kurdish repression within Turkey. “It would seem that British counter-terrorism policing is being made use of to pursue the Erdoğan government’s aims of stifling Kurdish political expression,” she said.

Then out of 20000 people, 20 are positives, and 19 will be stopped; out of 19980 negatives, 999 will be stopped.Compared to disease testing you may argue that FP is more harmful, but that&#x27;s a different question. The point is that even very non-random system will be dominated by FP.Edit: in particular, if they stop truly random people and 500 of them are linked to terrorism that implies that 20% of all people passing there are terrorists. reply burnished 15 hours agorootparentProbably important to note that this leads to tests not being performed without good reason because they cause more harm than they do good due to the false positive rate. reply eastbound 15 hours agorootparentprev> Unless you are willing to tolerate false negativesWe tolerate false negative all the time: Terrorism is not eradicated at all in UK.

NATO is a military alliance and in case one member gets attacked, others have to support this member. However, one cannot really be sure if that will happen when one country has been initiating arms embargos against another member. reply xorcist 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a complicated story. Turkey bought the Russian S-400 system instead of NATO weapons, partly because they have economic incentives to be on good foot with Russia, partly because want to be ambivalent enough towards the West to have take advantage of credible threats in upcoming negotiations, partly because of domestic policy reasons.As was expected, they pretty much immediately found themselves under US weapons embargo. Modern weaponry form integrated systems, and integrating a Russian system in a NATO system is pretty much out of the question for various practical reasons.The Swedish embargo however was different. Swedish law simply forbids export to countries that use force against civilians. There are plenty of well supported evidence of this taking places, not only in Syria. But all this have to be taken into context to understand the Turkish situation.Perhaps unfortunately, depending on your perspective, the Swedish embargo was lifted when the NATO negotiations started. That is Realpolitik for you. Nobody wants to risk a Turkey allied with the Eastern block. And Turkey knows perfectly well to take advantage of that. Thus far it seems to be working for Erdogan.

I made this. Tried posting it to Show yesterday, glad this thread is getting more momentum!For the past four months I&#x27;ve been working (part-time, this is OSS after all) on Harlequin, a SQL IDE for DuckDB that runs in your terminal. I built this because I work in Data, and I found myself often reaching for the DuckDB CLI to quickly query CSV or Parquet data, but then hitting a wall when using the DuckDB CLI as my queries got more complex and my result sets got larger.Harlequin is a drop-in replacement for the DuckDB CLI that runs in any terminal (even over SSH), but adds a browsable data catalog, full-powered text editor (with multiple buffer support), and a scrollable results viewer that can display thousands of records.Harlequin is written in Python, using the Textual framework. It&#x27;s licensed under MIT.Yesterday I released v1.0.0: you can try it out with `pip install harlequin`, or visit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harlequin.sh for docs and other info. reply ayhanfuat 12 hours agoparentLovely tool. I&#x27;ll certainly try it out. The code fragments in the documentation seem to be not selectable, though (or maybe it is not highlighting correctly). reply tconbeer 12 hours agorootparentit&#x27;s an issue with the highlight color.

Although I admit I&#x27;m a little puzzled when people simultaneously want to do a TUI but also design things so there is generous (excessive, actually) whitespace around everything to create the illusion of \"minimalism\" or \"comfort\".It&#x27;s a TUI! It should be buzzing with numbers, packed with information, sparing with space and using every pixel possible. btop[1] is a great example imo — one of the best.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristocratos&#x2F;btop reply zokier 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not in love with this style of UI design in terminals:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harlequin.sh&#x2F;_app&#x2F;immutable&#x2F;assets&#x2F;export.a0e81d27.p...Every item in the form takes 4 lines (I think?) whereas in more traditional curses UI they would be packed to one line per item, the scrollbar could have easily been avoided here. Smaller nitpick but that style of toggle switches is also form over function; I&#x27;d find traditional [X] far more clear&#x2F;less ambiguous reply rochak 10 hours agoparent+1.

The best curses interfaces make liberal use of highlighting and color, rather than box drawing characters, which take up too much real estate. Besides lazygit, which rocks, I would even point to the old DOS versions of MS Word, which had popups that were information dense but readable. reply ptman 1 hour agorootparentColor can be tricky too.

We only use duckdb in a few of them but are slowly replacing pandas etls with it. For some of our bigger jobs we use spark instead.Essentially it&#x27;s: 1. Data sources from places such as s3, sftp, rds 2. Use duckdb to load most of these with only extensions (I dont believe there&#x27;s one for sftp, so we just have some python code to pull the files out.) 3. transform the data however we&#x27;d like with duckdb. 4. convert the duckdb table to pyarrow 5. Save to s3 with delta-rsFWIW, we also have this all execute externally from our orchestration on an EC2 instance. This allows us to scale vertically. reply quadrature 14 hours agorootparentThis is very cool!.Last time I checked duckdb didn&#x27;t have the concept of a metastore so do you have an internal convention for table locations and folder structure ?.What do you use for reports&#x2F;visualizations? notebooks ?. reply zlurker 12 hours agorootparentYeah, dagster has a concept of metadata and assets so we have some code that&#x27;ll map dagster&#x27;s own logical representation to physical s3 locations.Reports and viz varies a lot, the finance department uses tableau where as for more &#x27;data sciencey&#x27; stuff we normally just use notebooks. reply quadrature 9 hours agorootparentHadn&#x27;t heard of that dagster feature, thats really cool. reply pbowyer 4 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m using it for site-search analytics. Originally I was using MariaDB but because we do search-as-you-type there&#x27;s a complex aggregation query to identify the \"real\" searches, and with 1000 entries that was taking 10s of seconds to run. Materialized views would&#x27;ve fixed that but...My stack is now JSON files containing the search data. At present I&#x27;m loading these into DuckDB and pre-aggregating due to a bug I found in DuckDB, not because it was needed for performance. reply tconbeer 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s great as: 1. An ephemeral processing engine. For example, I have a machine learning pipeline where I load data into a DataFrame, and then I can use DuckDB to execute SQL on my DataFrame (I prefer both the syntax and performance to Pandas). 2. A data lake processing engine. DuckDB makes it very easy to interact with partitioned files. 3. A lightweight datastore. I have one ETL pipeline where I need to cache the data if an API is unavailable. I just write the DataFrame to a DuckDB database that is on a mounted network filesystem, and read it back when I need it. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 13 hours agoparentprevOn a similar point, are people using the actual duck database format or sticking with Parquet? I love everything about DuckDB, but I feel more comfortable keeping things in an existing format.My only work with it to date has been to load-analyze-usuallydelete to refresh, so I do not require any db mutability. Outside of mutability, not sure if there are any obvious wins with the format. reply tconbeer 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a bit faster and easier than parquet, but right now the format is unstable, which is a huge downside and makes it unsuitable for medium&#x2F;long-term storage. After DuckDB v1, they&#x27;ll keep the format stable and then I think its popularity will increase dramatically. reply whoopdeepoo 6 hours agoparentprevWe use it to sort parquets out of core and then the arrow interface to read into Python and export as geoparquets reply souldeux 10 hours agoparentprevduckDB is one of the built-ins for count.co, which i&#x27;ve come to love reply thenipper 13 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been using it for taking output from our data validation steps and bundling that up with the data that was validated into one neat artifact we can download if there is an issue and explore manually. reply wodenokoto 1 hour agoprevKinda off topic but how do I install these pip sourced command line applications such that they are available regardless of which virtual environment I am using? reply duckmysick 1 hour agoparentAs mentioned in Getting Started, with `pipx`:`pipx install harlequin`From the pipx documentation:> This automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package&#x27;s associated applications (entry points) to a location on your PATH.It makes the command available globally, but sandboxes the package in its own virtual environment.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pypa&#x2F;pipx reply aargh_aargh 3 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t mean to minimize the effort and contribution of this project in any way, and I understand the author is scratching their own itch, but I&#x27;m curious why this is specific to DuckDB?

It seems nice and maybe it has nice features, but what about these features is so highly dependent on being accessible through a \"menu\"? Do you reach for the \"menu\" all the time? Or are there fancy \"dialogs\"?This feels like Vim, but with some strange plugin that provides a \"menu\".

This is mostly true, but it's slightly missing the forest for the trees. Consider this famous and often misunderstood quote by Richard Stallman: I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Nikon D3300, 35mm f/1.8 DX, a red formula one style car speeds along a racetrack with visible tire skidmarks. Photo by Xe Iaso Many pages of ink have been spilled over analyzing this quote, and a lot of them fall short of really getting at the heart of the matter. What this actually means is something like this: By itself, Linux is useless. It does boot the system, it does interface with hardware, but without a bunch of other tools, it's not very useful. It's like a car without a steering wheel, or a boat without a rudder. It does something, but it's not very useful. The real value of things like the GNU project, systemd, openrc and other tools in that vein is that they make Linux useful. They make it into a complete system that you can use to do things. They are the proverbial steering wheel and rudder in the metaphor.Fun fact, if you try to boot a Linux kernel without an init process, it'll just panic and crash! Most Linux systems on the face of the planet are built with GNU tools and utilities. In order to compile the Linux kernel, you need to use GCC. In order to run ls to list files in the current directory, you need to use GNU coreutils. Every dynamically linked program uses glibc for performing basic system interactions like writing to files or opening network sockets. Everything is built on top of the GNU toolset. This is why Stallman is so adamant about calling it GNU/Linux. It's not that he's trying to take credit for Linux, it's that he's trying to give credit to the GNU project for making Linux useful. However, there's a lot of room for nuance here. For example, Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution that uses musl libc instead of glibc and busybox instead of GNU coreutils. It's still a Linux distribution, but it doesn't use the GNU toolset. It's still a Linux distribution, but it's not GNU/Linux.Also, for the record you can build the Linux kernel with clang, but that's a whole other can of worms. For one, GCC supports many more targets than clang likely ever will, but in general there are some compromises you need to make until clang implements some GCC-specific compiler extensions a bit better. Google, Facebook, and a few other companies do run LLVM compiled kernels in production though, so it's probably closer to viable than you think. Especially if you use ChromeOS or Android. So, what is a Linux distribution? It's a collection of tools that make Linux useful. It's a collection of tools that make Linux into a complete system. It's not a \"flavor\" of Linux (though this conceptually can exist with alternative kernels like the Zen kernel patchset), it's a system that just so happens to make Linux useful. As a counter-argument, consider the reason why Linux runs on more devices worldwide than there are people: Android. Android does use the Linux kernel, but it doesn't use any GNU tools in the stack at all. You can't take programs that are compiled against other Linux distributions and run them on Android. You can't take programs that are compiled against Android and run them on other Linux distributions.Wait, so does this mean Android's not a Linux distribution? What is it then? I'm going to argue that Android is not a Linux distribution unto itself. Android is a Linux implementation. It uses the Linux kernel, but that's where the similarities with the rest of the ecosystem end. Android is its own little world where there's just enough system tools to get the system running, but once you get into the UI, it's a completely different world. It's a completely different ecosystem. It's a completely different operating system.So what's the difference between a Linux distribution and a Linux implementation?It's a bit of a fuzzy line, but I'd say that a Linux distribution is a collection of discrete tools that make Linux useful, and a Linux implementation is a cohesive collection of bespoke tools that make Linux into a complete system. Really, you could argue that if it has /bin/sh, it's a Linux distribution. gokrazy gokrazy is a Linux implementation that I've used off and on for a few years now. It's a very interesting project because everything on the system is written in Go save the kernel. The init process is in Go (and even listens over HTTP to handle updates!), every userland process is written in Go, and even the core system services are written in Go. Out of the box a gokrazy install comes with these basic tools: The init process that is mandated to be the parent of all userland processes by the Linux kernel. A DHCP client that automatically configures the network interface. A NTP client that automatically sets the system clock. A little tool to save randomness from the kernel to a file so that it can be used to seed the random number generator on boot (because the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a robust hardware random number generator) That's it. Everything else from the web UI to A/B update logic is written in Go. It boots in literal seconds, uses an insanely small amount of RAM out of the box, and runs with nearly zero overhead. When you configure your gokrazy install to run additional software, you do so by adding the Go command path to a configuration file and then updating to trigger a reboot into the new version. Here's an example of what my gokrazy virtual machine's file tree looks like: / # tree etc gokrazy user etc ├── breakglass.authorized_keys ├── gokr-pw.txt ├── gokrazy │ └── sbom.json ├── hostname ├── hosts ├── http-port.txt ├── https-port.txt ├── localtime ├── machine-id ├── resolv.conf -> /tmp/resolv.conf └── ssl └── ca-bundle.pem gokrazy ├── dhcp ├── heartbeat ├── init ├── ntp └── randomd user ├── breakglass ├── fbstatus ├── qemu-guest-kragent ├── serial-busybox ├── tailscale ├── tailscaled └── waifud-gok-agent That is the entire system. It's all stripped down to these few programs, configuration files, and one symlink for DNS resolution. This is a very minimal system, and it's all you need to run statically linked Go programs. It's very easy to deploy your own services to it too. It's probably the easiest platform I know of that lets you just deploy a Go binary and have it run as a service, automatically restarting when it crashes. The tooling When I used gokrazy back in the day, you had to use a command line called gokr-packer that you passed a bunch of command line flags to with information about all the Go programs you wanted to run on the machine, configuration for those programs, and any other meta-information like where the update tool should push the image to. It was a bit of a pain to use, but it worked. Recently the gok tool was added to the project, and this has been revolutionary when it comes to using and administrating gokrazy installs. Essentially, gok is a wrapper around the existing gokr-packer logic with a JSON file to store your configuration details. It's a lot easier to use, understand, and automate. You don't have to remember command line flags or maintain unwieldy scripts. You just edit a JSON file and push updates with gok update. It's amazingly simple. Setting up a gokrazy machine As an example, I'm going to show you how to install a bunch of tailnet addons to a gokrazy machine. I'm also going to assume that you don't have a gokrazy install set up yet, so we'll need to install it. To do this, we'll need to do a few simple things: Install the gok tool. Create your gok configuration. Install Tailscale on the machine. Create your \"seed\" image with gok overwrite. Boot it on your Raspberry Pi or VM. Push any updates to the image to the machine with gok update. First, let's install the gok tool. In order to do this, you need to have the Go toolchain installed. Once you have that, you can run go install to install the gok tool: go install github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gok@mainYou may want to ensure that ~/go/bin is in your $PATH variable so that you can run it by the name gok instead of ~/go/bin/gok. Next, create a new gokrazy configuration with gok new: gok new -i casa This will create a configuration named casa (cf: Spanish for \"house\") in ~/gokrazy/casa. This is where all of your configuration files will live. You can edit the configuration file with gok edit: gok edit -i casa If you are making a virtual machine Let's make our lives easier by installing Tailscale on the machine. By default, gokrazy will announce its hostname over DHCP, which usually makes most consumer routers pick it up and then lets you ping it by name. When you have MagicDNS enabled, Tailscale can take over this logic and prevent you from accessing the machine by name. However, Tailscale is written in Go and doesn't require any of the services that most Linux distributions provide in order to function. It's a perfect fit for gokrazy. You can install it with gok add: gok add tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled gok add tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale And be sure to add the mkfs service to create a persistent partition on /perm: gok add github.com/gokrazy/mkfs Next, fetch an auth key from the admin console and make sure you check that it's reusable. Then, add the following to your configuration file under the PackageConfig block: { // ... \"PackageConfig\": { // ... \"tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale\": { \"CommandLineFlags\": [ \"up\", // paste your key here! \"--authkey=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2\" ] }, // ... } // ... }You can pass any other tailscale up flags you want here, such as --advertise-exit-node if you want to use your gokrazy machine as an exit node. This will make your machine automatically connect to Tailscale on boot. Next, we need to create our \"seed\" image with gok overwrite. First, figure out what the device node for your SD card is. On Linux, you can do this with lsblk: lsblk And then look for the one that has the same size as your SD card. In my case, it's /dev/sdd. Once you have that, you can run gok overwrite: gok overwrite --full /dev/sdd However if you want to write the image to a file (such as if you are doing mass distribution or making a VM image), you need to use gok overwrite with a file instead of a device node. This will create a 16 GB image: gok overwrite -i casa --full gokrazy.img --target_storage_bytes 17179869184 Once you have your image, you can write it to your SD card with dd (or balenaEtcher) or import it into your virtual machine hypervisor of choice. Once you have your image written to your SD card, you can boot it on your Raspberry Pi or VM.Wait, so how do I log in with a shell?You don't. gokrazy doesn't have a login prompt. It's a single-user system. There is breakglass as a tool of last resort to modify things, but you only have a very minimal subset of busybox to work with, so it should be avoided if at all possible. Once you have your machine booted and it responds to pings over Tailscale, you can open its HTTP interface in your browser. If you called your machine casa, you can open it at http://casa. It will prompt you for a username and password. Your username is gokrazy, and the password is near the top of your config.json file. When you log in, you'll see a screen like this: This is the gokrazy web UI. It lets you see the status of your machine and any logs that are being generated by your applications. You can also start, stop, and restart any of your applications from here. It's a very simple UI, but it's fantastic for debugging and monitoring. Tailnet addons Now that we have a Gokrazy system up and running, let's add some programs to it! I'm going to list a couple tailnet addons that give your tailnet superpowers. These are all written in Go, so they're a perfect fit for gokrazy. Today I'm going to show you how to install these tools into your tailnet: golink - a URL shortener at http://go tmemes - an internal meme generator you can host at http://memegen tclip - a pastebin you can host at http://paste These tools help you augment your tailnet by giving you tools that will make you and your team's life a lot easier. A URL shortener helps you link to complicated Google Docs URLs. A meme generator gives you a new innovative way to let off steam. A pastebin lets you share text with your team without having to worry about the service you're using going offline due to no fault of your own. golink To install golink, we need to add the golink binary to the configuration. You can do this with gok add: gok add github.com/tailscale/golink/cmd/golink Then configure it with gok edit: { // ... \"PackageConfig\": { // ... \"github.com/tailscale/golink/cmd/golink\": { \"CommandLineFlags\": [ \"--sqlitedb=/perm/home/golink/data.db\" ], \"Environment\": [ // the same one from before \"TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2\" ], // don't start the service until NTP catches up \"WaitForClock\": true }, // ... } // ... } And finally push it with gok update: gok update -i casa It'll build the image, push it out over Tailscale, trigger a reboot, and be back up in the span of a minute. Once it's back up, you can open the web UI again and see the status of your golink instance at http://casa/status?path=%2fuser%2fgolink: And then you can start using short URLs at http://go: And that's it! You now have a super minimal VM running small programs that let you do useful things to you. You can add more programs to your configuration file and push them with gok update to add more functionality to your machine. You can even add your own programs to the configuration file and push them to your machine. It's a very simple system, but it's very powerful. tmemes Google is infamous for having an internal service named memegen. This allows Googlers to make internal-facing memes about the slings and arrows that impact them as highly paid programmers. This is an internal service inside Google that has a lot of serious investment of time and energy to make it the best possible experience it can be. It's to the point that reportedly people can keep up with how an all-hands meeting is going by the tone of the sarcastic memes that are being posted to memegen. The main reason this is run inside Google is to avoid information leaking via memes. Yes, this is an actual threat model. Thanks to the magic of Tailscale, you can make your own private memegen using tmemes. tmemes is a tailnet addon that lets you post image macro templates and layer wisdom over it in the form of text. Here's an example meme: To add tmemes to your gokrazy machine, you can use gok add: gok add github.com/tailscale/tmemes/tmemes Then open your config with gok edit and add the following to your PackageConfig block: { // ... \"PackageConfig\": { // ... \"github.com/tailscale/tmemes/tmemes\": { \"Environment\": [ \"TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2\" ], \"CommandLineFlags\": [ // change this to your desired hostname \"--hostname=memegen\", // change this to your username on Tailscale \"--admin=Xe@github\", \"--store=/perm/home/tmemes\" ], \"WaitForClock\": true }, // ... }, // ... } And then push it with gok update: gok update -i casa Then you can head to http://memegen and upload a template to make your own dank memes. If you want to integrate your own tools with tmemes, you can check out the API documentation. This should help you do whatever it is you want with a meme generator as a service. tclip Sometimes you just need a place to paste text and get a URL pointing to it. tclip is a tool that you can add to your tailnet and get exactly that. It's a very simple tool, but it's very useful. It's also written in Go, so it's a perfect fit for gokrazy. Their recent update to remove Cgo dependencies makes it possible to run your tclip node on a gokrazy machine. To add tclip to your gokrazy machine, you can use gok add: gok add github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip/cmd/tclipd Then open your config with gok edit and add the following to your PackageConfig block: { // ... \"PackageConfig\": { // ... \"github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip/cmd/tclipd\": { \"CommandLineFlags\": [ \"--data-location=/perm/home/tclip/\" ], \"WaitForClock\": true, \"Environment\": [ \"TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2\", \"USE_FUNNEL=true\" // Remove this if you don't want to use Funnel ] }, // ... } } And then push it with gok update: gok update -i casa And then you can start using it by heading to http://paste. Install the command-line tool on your development workstation with go install: go install github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip/cmd/tclip@latest Here's an example tclip link if you want to see what it looks like in practice: interjection.c. It's a very simple tool, but it's very useful. Conclusion gokrazy is insanely cool. It's the easiest way to deploy Go services to your homelab. It integrates seamlessly with Tailscale, and is something that I'm very excited to see grow and mature. I'm very excited to see what the future holds for gokrazy, and I'm very excited to see what people do with it. I've seen signs that they're going to be adding an automatic update process, and that has me very excited. I'm also excited to see what other services people add to the gokrazy ecosystem. I'm hoping to add a few of my own in the future, and I'm hoping to see what other people do with it.Spoiler alert: waifud support is coming soon to a homelab near you.

The worst part about setting up a raspberry pi is having to get out a keyboard and monitor (or serial cable) to manually configure a the rpi before you can start using it. Gokrazy builds fully configured system images, so the rpi comes up properly without having to shell into it first. Gokrazy also lets you push updated images over the network.The other issue I often had with raspberry pi systems was the high probability that an `apt-get upgrade` would trigger a filesystem error on mediocre sdcards. Gokrazy also helps with this 1) by having a read-only file system by default, 2) by using a&#x2F;b partitions for updates, and 3) having very small image sizes.It has honestly rejuvenated my enthusiasm for running code on raspberries pi. reply rcarmo 15 hours agoparentI never had any serious issue with SD cards since the Pi 2B (and I&#x27;ve kept Pis running for years).Anyway, for those wanting to deploy more generic apps, that is why I initially wrote https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;piku&#x2F;piku - you still have to flash the OS (and rpi-imager does that with sane defaults these days), but once you&#x27;re done you have Heroku-like deployments for any language runtime you install on the Pi.I also have https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rcarmo&#x2F;ground-init, a cloud-init like shim that simplifies setting up machines (I&#x27;m a big fan of cloud-init, but since Raspbian doesn&#x27;t support it and Ubuntu on ARM requires some fiddling to make it work I decided it wasn&#x27;t too hard to roll my own).(I probably should look into glueing that into rpi-imager, but there is are only so many hours in the day...) reply jchw 11 hours agoparentprevGokrazy seems pretty great and I loved the idea the moment I saw a description of what it does. (Though, disappointingly, I&#x27;ve never actually tried it.) I&#x27;ve long been interested in trying to write the entire usermode of a Linux system just because it seems interesting what you could do; the Linux kernel offers a whole lot of functionality. I&#x27;ve had the thought that this would be really fun to do on Pinephone, although in that case it does sort-of feel like you&#x27;re just inventing another Android... Maybe focusing on making Wayland work better on phones would be a more productive use of everyone&#x27;s time :)However, I will say one thing about Raspberry Pi&#x27;s: If you ever find yourself needing to use Raspbian for any reason, you can configure a lot of things by editing the boot files on the FAT32 boot partition. For example, you can throw a wpa_supplicant config to get WiFi working, enable SSH, etc. just using the boot partition. This is basically how I manage Raspberry Pis that I&#x27;m just messing around with, although cooking a fresh root image every time would definitely be a nicer solution for \"real\" work. (My weapon of choice would probably be NixOS in most cases, but I have to try gokrazy first if I ever deploy anything interesting and less temporary to a Raspberry Pi in the near future.) reply ripley12 15 hours agoparentprevHave you tried recent versions of the Raspberry Pi Imager utility? It lets you build pre-configured Raspbian images, similar to what you&#x27;re describing. reply psanford 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t seem like that gives you the ability to push image updates over the network.

I feel that ought to have been disclosed in this article.That gripe aside - I love this idea and the general principle. Minimal OS&#x27;s are really interesting to me. I&#x27;ve long dreamed of a basic environment where there are 3 UI surfaces: a Terminal, a Web server &#x2F; browser, an OpenGL context. Of course, if you have a full capablity web browser you can emulate a Terminal and use WebGL for 3d.Of course, things like this exist I am sure - but the idea that you could have one that is a dozen files is super compelling. It reminds me of how I was able to get a basic http server in C using civetweb which is a handful of files I can just copy-paste into my source tree.

I&#x27;ve just been playing with Gokrazy a couple weeks ago, and just kept thinking \"this is so cool\". If you&#x27;re building some sort of an appliance, and want the least amount of reliance on &#x2F; hassle maintaining the base OS, it definitely is a viable choice.It can also run programs that are not written in go, by using a little neat hack to build&#x2F;embed a binary inside a Go package; this is e.g. how Gokrazy sets up persistent storage: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gokrazy&#x2F;mkfsI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone; if you&#x27;re relying on your base OS &#x2F; package manager for a lot of stuff, or just want to run Docker containers, I think there are simpler&#x2F;better ways to set things up. But it&#x27;s absolutely great at what it&#x27;s made for; doubly so with the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s finally being back in stock. reply andrewfromx 14 hours agoprevQuestion about Gokrazy for the group then.

Too many x11 deps and weird stuff that makes it so much easier to just run go build on the rpi itself. reply heleninboodler 12 hours agoparentCross-compiling something for gokrazy will likely be a can of worms if it has a lot of C dependencies, which tend to be dynamically linked by default. There&#x27;s no dynamic library loader on gokrazy, so you either need to add one yourself or get all those C deps (and their deps) to be statically compiled into your Go binary. Neither is a picnic, although maybe someone else has already done the work of figuring out how to set up a dynamic loader. reply hackernudes 17 hours agoprevSee also https:&#x2F;&#x2F;u-root.org&#x2F; reply beardog 16 hours agoprevThere is even a desktop environment written in Go: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fyshos.com&#x2F;desktop&#x2F; reply fragmede 11 hours agoprevThe examples aren&#x27;t copy-and-pastable; you need to add the -i casa to all the commands if you want to use that namespace, eg: gok -i casa add tailscale.com&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;tailscale reply j3s 18 hours agoprevthis couldn’t be better timed. i just started using gokrazy + tailscale + a reverse proxy running on a VPS to host https:&#x2F;&#x2F;j3s.sh! my plan is to get a “this van runs linux” bumper sticker, since my gokrazy machine is powered by my vani’ll make a blog post about this setup soon, it’s all still pretty in flux rn.one thing worth mentioning is that if you’re operating in a limited bandwidth environment, goks update may be annoying&#x2F;impossible to tolerate - it uploads the full resulting squashfs to the pi.in my case, it’s about 40MB over the network per change, even if it’s just a flag adjustment. that’s just the cost of the “appliance model”(comment x-posted from another site) reply lagniappe 16 hours agoparentCool site :) I think there is a template error at the moment listing the books you&#x27;re reading. books i&#x27;m reading currently:template: now.html:9:33: executing \"now.html\" at : can&#x27;t evaluate field CurrentBooks in type struct { Title string; Data interface {} } reply j3s 16 hours agorootparentindeed there is. i tore the backend of my website apart the other night & haven&#x27;t gotten to fixing that page quite yet. thx for letting me know :3 reply andrewstuart 16 hours agoprevIf anything, Linux should be called Linux&#x2F;systemd rather than GNU&#x2F;Linux.I’d be happy with a Linux entirely without GNU.

Thanks! reply tredre3 13 hours agorootparentNot sure if you were being snarky but having the ability to scroll doesn&#x27;t fix a poorly structured article...Things should be explained as they come, or have a linked explanation, or say things like \"we&#x27;ll explain what XYZ is later\".If an article is about a tool but I don&#x27;t know what the tool is and the first paragraph doesn&#x27;t explain it, am I really expected to skim the entire article in the hope that somewhere is hidden an explanation, and then go back and read from the top? That can&#x27;t possibly be good story telling? reply akaij 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it would be too wild to imagine that, maybe, this article isn&#x27;t meant for you. It does seem perfect for other people that might benefit from a primer on the background.Good storytelling comes in many shapes and forms, maybe the author was trying to use anticipation as the main element!I really don&#x27;t understand the surprise you&#x27;re apparently filled with when coming across an article that&#x27;s not presented in the way you expected; an imaginary problem that stops existing once you scroll down or do a keyword search.Unsolicited recommendation, if I may: do not watch Pulp Fiction. reply bluedays 11 hours agorootparentprevThat’s the part of the article that I liked reply gabereiser 17 hours agoparentprevIn all honesty, if you write go programs, provided you don’t need CGo, you can write bare metal services that can bootstrap and run as pid 0. Try doing that with .Net or Java (ok, you technically can, but it’s a challenge). Go + Linux Kernel and maybe musl is really all you need to run a go web service.

Alpine Linux is only like 8 MB more :( reply oooyay 16 hours agorootparentI prefer to run my service containers without a shell or much of an operating system. YMMV but in this corporate world where every container is scanned for every CVE and some binaries are deep inspected my list of vulnerabilities on a more full fledged container or VM can become a task that spirals out of control. The context being that many (maybe even most) of those CVEs probably don&#x27;t pertain to how I use the software or package and that it&#x27;s far easier to patch than file for an exemption.Thus, I spend the investment up front in getting log streaming working, my logs are concise, I implement application monitoring, and I demand host monitoring from the platforms I use. If I check all of those boxes, I generally don&#x27;t have anything I need to do with a shell. reply ericbarrett 15 hours agorootparentI fully agree with you about vuln scans, but as a counterpoint there have been dozens of times when I&#x27;ve saved hours of debugging with a well-applied strace or tcpdump. Logging and monitoring are great and necessary, but they&#x27;ll only catch things you thought of ahead of time; using them to debug something ongoing is basically printf() debugging where compile time = the full length of your CI&#x2F;CD pipeline. reply lifty 13 hours agorootparentDepending on how you run your containers, you should be able to run a debug container in the same namespace as your target container. That way you can keep your images lean and bundle all the debugging tools in a different image, which you run only when you need to. reply oooyay 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that&#x27;s definitely a valid take depending on your setup. If I have those kinds of problems with a container then I generally jump into the underlying VM or metal to use those tools, but that also implies a lot of knowledge around how a host system incorporates container networking, which arguably makes hard troubleshooting even harder. On headless systems they usually come with some sort of privileged \"admin\" container, so the setup is the same.Second to that is that I have dev stages that are built with containers that do have those tools, and generally if I run into those kinds of problems I see them in dev first. reply msm_ 12 hours agorootparentprev>tons of docker images in production that lack basic debugging functionality like... a shellThat&#x27;s a commendable security practice. A whole class of vulnerabilities is mitigated (and others are much harder to exploit) if you don&#x27;t add unnecessary junk to your images, like a shell.It&#x27;s also endorsed by Google via distroless: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleContainerTools&#x2F;distroless reply brainzap 16 hours agorootparentprevwhy do you need a shell in production? reply xena 3 hours agorootparentThis is the wrong question.

Your services should be logging to another system. If you need a shell to debug, you don’t need bare metal Golang. Go with Alpine (pun).While novel, you really need to have the engineering excellence in your org to be able to struct log to another system, blue&#x2F;green deployments, etc.One place where I worked where did bare metal orchestration with containers, we had tooling around seeing which services were failing, where to go look at logs (and filter them), and we threw away the ssh keys to the AWS ECS hosts to force you into a CD deployment model.

    "originBody": "Changelog Podcasts Posts Community Subscribe Changelog++ Submit News Sign In changelog.com/posts XML is better than YAML. Hear me out... there's always something better than YAML by Carl Johnson 2023-09-20 This is a fancified excerpt of Carl M. Johnson’s unpopular opinion on the Go Time podcast. Click here to listen along while you read or watch the video on YouTube. Jump to the end for the poll results. 📊 My spicy take is that XML is better than YAML, because there are situations where XML is appropriate, but there’s no situation where YAML is appropriate. Johnny Boursiquot: Dang. Shots fired! 🤣 Let’s talk about XML first So, XML got a really bad reputation. The reason it got a really bad reputation is because people were using it for things that it should never have been used for. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. And if you’re using it as an extensible markup language, it’s actually really great. Let’s say you’re working on something and you’re like: “I’m making a new kind of book, and I need to annotate all of the verses in the Bible, and have the chapter headings and stuff.” It’s great for that. It’s really good for when you have a document, and some things are italicized, and some things are in a foreign language, and subtitles, and all that stuff. It’s really good for that. It’s not good if it’s like: “I need to configure this server and the server needs to know if this value is true or false.” No, that’s bad. Don’t do that. That’s not a good use for XML. But XML does have some uses for which it’s appropriate. And I think the fact that now everybody is writing React… and they’re writing it with JSX… and JSX is basically just inline XML… I think that shows that there are cases where actually XML is pretty good. YAML on the other hand YAML on the other hand I think is never good. There’s always something better than YAML! We’ve finally made it to Go 1.21 and I’m very happy about this. And you know why? Because YAML repeatedly bit me in the behind on Go 1.20. Ask me why. Johnny Boursiquot: Why? Well, when you say in your test file: “test this against Go 1.20” It interprets that as Go 1.2. 😭🤣 So it was like two or three different times I had a repo where I’m like: “These tests aren’t passing. Why are my tests not passing?! I’ve just upgraded to Go 1.20.” And it was like: “Oh, no. I’ve decided that this is Go 1.2” And so YAML is always going to do that to you… Better choices Now, I understand why people do YAML, but there are better choices. You can use TOML. You can use CUE. You can use lots of things. I like how Caddy does it. With Caddy, the canonical language that Caddy understands is JSON, but they have adapters. So if you want to write YAML, you can. But it’ll just take that YAML and turn it into JSON behind the scenes. Then they also have a specific Caddy language. So you can give it the Caddy language and then it turns that into JSON behind the scenes. And you can give it an NGINX config and it’ll turn that into JSON behind the scenes. If you have the cycles and time to spare, that’s probably the best solution for most people… But when the only way to do it is YAML, it’s like: “No…!” It’s just too error-prone, there’s too many things… You just have to always quote everything. Also… Also the YAML specification has all these features that nobody ever uses, because they’re really confusing, and hard, and you can include documents inside of other documents, with references and stuff… And it’s like “Oh, man, I don’t want to have to understand any of this stuff.” And then if you’re not careful, it’d be like: “Oh yeah, the first three things I fed it to understood that, but then the third one was just like using some parser that they found on the back of a truck, and it doesn’t understand it” and it’s like: “Oh, man…” YAML… never appropriate.

    "commentBody": "XML is better than YAML – Hear me outHacker NewspastloginXML is better than YAML – Hear me out (changelog.com) 252 points by nalgeon 17 hours ago| hidepastfavorite466 comments MenhirMike 9 hours agoNo offense to the creator of YAML, but: The fact that it became one of the de-facto standards for cloud tooling is an absolutely damning statement about the state of the industry.I get that XML is about as sexy as mainframes, and that a lot of folks here probably have PTSD from working with Java&#x2F;Spring web apps, but YAML is about the worst of all worlds.Though I think the real problem is that real-world configuration files are way too complicated for a simple&#x2F;dumb&#x2F;logic-less representation like a .ini&#x2F;.conf file, so someone thinks to add some logic to is - which is just config-as-code. In a terrible programming language.If you want config-as-code (and you want to!), just do it properly and use a proper programming language for it. Don&#x27;t care which one, be it JavaScript, Python, Go, PDP-11 Assembly, or Rust. But please stop with these half-measure DSLs that just don&#x27;t cut it. reply kumarvvr 7 hours agoparentMost people who lambast XML probably have never used XML or never had to need XML.I designed a complex data acquisition system and after a lot of research, I settled on XML as the only viable option for complex user configuration, that is both readable and rich in content.I then built a UI system that works with the XML and generates cofig docs with ease.Sure, XML has been used in SOAP like systems, and it rightfully gets a bad rap, but that is more on the user than the technology.A hierarchical document with values and attributes and custom tags? That is an almost DSL in itself. reply unscaled 6 hours agorootparent> I then built a UI system that works with the XML and generates cofig docs with ease.I lost you there. Not that I&#x27;m criticizing you since I&#x27;ve gone the same route and built a complex UI tool to manage said config (complete with XSD schema validation and config schema migration using XSLT for version upgrades).But now I realize that modern developers don&#x27;t want a GUI to manage their config. We want to store it git, review changes and perhaps even write our own automation and templating around it.YAML is certainly a flawed format for most of these purposes, but so is XML. It is unnecessarily verbose and it carries a lot of complexity which was designed for a highly-extensible generic document format, but not for configuration files. XSD, Namespaces, Entities, Embedded DTD, CDATA blocks... You can&#x27;t just ignore all of these, and there are very few parsers out there which work on a well-defined subset of XML. And even there, the whole attribute-vs-child-element choice is a giant distraction and constant source for unnecessary bikeshedding.YAML has serious ambiguity issues, but there are better alternatives that have great library support like TOML. We don&#x27;t have to go back to the excesses of the early 2000s and use XML as a configuration format. reply mumblemumble 6 hours agorootparentIn XML&#x27;s defense, the attribute-vs-child-element choice is always obvious and straightforward when you&#x27;re using it as a markup language. It&#x27;s only when you use it as object notation that it becomes wonky, because there the choice simply doesn&#x27;t map to any straightforward characteristic of the problem domain. I&#x27;m not sure I want to hold XML responsible for not being good at being something it isn&#x27;t.And, on that note, I think that if I could pick as single thing that irritates me the most about YAML, it&#x27;s that it isn&#x27;t actually a ML. reply unscaled 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not criticizing having attributes-vs-child-elements. The problem with XML is not that it exists or that it is a particularly badly designed markup language.The problem is that XML is ill-suited for configuration files. reply wokkel 3 hours agorootparentWhy? I can store it in version control. I can validate if the file has syntax errors or schema errors etc. etc. With a proper platform it&#x27;s easy to generate or parse. It allows for both hierarchical structures (looking at you .ini). The only downside might be that you need a larger library to parse it. But i probably encounter xml somewhere along the line anyway due to interactions with a 3rd party system, so that point is moot. reply dvdkon 2 hours agorootparentYou have a low bar for config languages. I&#x27;d also like one to not be overly verbose, not be clearly intended for markup instead of object storage and not have security issues until you configure the parser just right (though that&#x27;s often not an issue with configs). XML fails all of these, and YAML isn&#x27;t much better.If we&#x27;re limiting ourselves to just JSON, INI, XML and YAML as potential choices, I get why people cling onto one of these suboptimal choices and then fiercely defend it, but there are other options. There&#x27;s libconfig, JSON5, Dhall, various interpreted languages...Sadly these alternatives are far from mainstream and have no support in standard libraries, so I think most developers will continue to pick whichever common option&#x27;s issues they can deal with. reply baq 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah JSX and especially TSX would be quite nice. YAML though can’t die soon enough. reply dragonwriter 4 hours agorootparentprev> And, on that note, I think that if I could pick as single thing that irritates me the most about YAML, it&#x27;s that it isn&#x27;t actually a ML.“YAML ain&#x27;t markup language” is kinda the whole point. reply LukeShu 4 hours agorootparentFor a full year it stood for \"Yet Another Markup Language\".First draft: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yaml.org&#x2F;spec&#x2F;history&#x2F;2001-03-30.htmlLast draft calling it that: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yaml.org&#x2F;spec&#x2F;history&#x2F;2001-12-10.htmlFirst draft with the new acronym: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yaml.org&#x2F;spec&#x2F;history&#x2F;2002-04-07.html reply xorcist 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s also funny that the file extension YML is the successor of XML, so the rest is probably a backronym from that. reply CableNinja 6 hours agorootparentprevI recently started a new project, and just outright didnt want to use yaml to do it. Sadly, im not everyone, and if i plan to release this project, i need to account for that. Whats a guy to do?Ill tell ya hwhat... I made some simple functions; one to load any yaml&#x2F;toml&#x2F;json from file, by just looking at the extension (and providing an override for not normal file extensions). Another to output any data as yaml&#x2F;toml&#x2F;json.I defaulted to using toml for my project, but have provided ways for everyone to be happy, with zero mucking around.Aaaaaand for the not so subtle promotion, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;atckitLocated in the UtilFuncs class. reply elzbardico 4 minutes agorootparentWhat is the point of substituting yaml for something even worse? reply wsc981 5 hours agorootparentprevI think I’d prefer JSON over both XML and YAML when dealing with config files.XML is just to verbose, making it harder to parse in my brain.YAML is whitespace sensitive which I hate in general. reply planede 4 minutes agorootparentXML is whitespace sensitive, unless your particular schema just doesn&#x27;t care about whitespace text nodes. reply yjftsjthsd-h 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m fine with JSON except it doesn&#x27;t officially do comments, but that&#x27;s a big deal IMO reply Koffiepoeder 4 hours agorootparentMight be interesting to check out json5.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;json5.org&#x2F; reply FlyingSnake 2 hours agorootparentThis is a great example why we should avoid writing custom DSLs and just use a proper programming language. reply eitland 1 hour agorootparentThen again, Gradle has come to show why that is a terrible idea.I think at some point 24 out of 28 Gradle projects I had access to at a certain customer had variations in either kotlin&#x2F;Groovy style or the way they did or didn&#x27;t use variables, how they did or didn&#x27;t do loops or maps and what not.With Maven you (or someone who know Maven) can immediately look at a rather small, very standardized file and start making educated guesses and so can an IDE.With Gradle you sometimes have to run it to actually know what it will do. reply aftoprokrustes 9 minutes agorootparentI had the same experience with Maven vs SBT (scala build system, config is scala). At first it is really cool to have access to a full programming language (in particular when it is the same as the one the project is in, which means that you do not need to \"switch brains\" when working on the config), but quickly people start trying to be smart or cute, and it becomes a big mess. In particular in Scala, where people _love_ defining new DSLs and favor cuteness over readability. After two years working with SBT I still do not really understand some of the DSLish constructs used in there (and I tried to read the docs).On the other side I fell in the trap of trying to overcome the limitations of purely declarative config formats by using jinja templates, which also ended up being a very bad idea and a maintenance nightmare.For most projects, my approach is now to try to be as standard as possible compared to the particular community in the tech at end, and resist the urge to be smart or cute (hard!). Configuration always sucks, and I now prefer to just suck it up and get done with the config part, rather than loosing time reinventing the wheel, ending with a config that still sucks _and_ no one understands. JD557 1 hour agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s only popular in the scala ecosystem, but I find HOCON to be a pretty nice superset. reply sixothree 4 hours agorootparentprevWhich is especially problematic for config files where you want helpful hints or a place to store the “old value” while you do something else with the app. I have an app where I change a specific config almost every time I use it. I usually just copy the entire darn node and rename it to something that doesn’t get deserialized. Closest I can get to holding the value in a comment. reply physicsguy 2 hours agorootparentprevMuch easier to have invalid JSON than invalid XML as jsonschema isn’t even close reply frant-hartm 5 hours agorootparentprevYou know that JSON is subset of yaml, right? reply arwineap 4 hours agorootparentThe commenter said they preferred json over yaml because yaml is whitespace sensitive; Json is notyaml&#x27;s feature set is also too broad, forcing safe loaders reply dragonwriter 4 hours agorootparentprevSince most people’s (especially critics) understanding of YAML is stuck on YAML 1.1 where that wasn&#x27;t quite true, probably not. reply kumarvvr 5 hours agorootparentprevI built it to make it so that average users can make their own config. The main system works off on only XML files. reply thayne 5 hours agorootparentprevI have used XML a fair amount in past years, but now avoid it.There is a subset of XML that a decent language for some use cases. In particular it is good for documents whete you want a _markup_ language.But I&#x27;ve seen it used for a lot of things where it wasn&#x27;t a great fit.And xml has too many features, which leads to implementations that are inconsistent with each, often slow, and have security problems such as xxe.I wish that there was a standardized simplified xml format, that would avoid many of xmls problems and meet the needs of 90% of applications where xml is a good fit. reply emodendroket 5 hours agorootparentprev> Most people who lambast XML probably have never used XML or never had to need XML.This seems like an absurd thing to say. XML went through an extreme bout of popularity. Maybe you could plausibly say that people have been soured on XML by ill-conceived uses for it that don&#x27;t demonstrate its strengths... but you think most people have never worked with it? Come on. reply wokkel 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve done my fair share of systems integrations and the number of teams that did not know xml or have never used it in a professional settings was around 20%. Of those who did use it a staggering amount of people never understood namespaces and started testing for equality on the element name and namespace prefix string instead of the namespace declaration. When somebody claims they \"know\" xml I initially treat it as a developer saying that he&#x2F;she knows &#x27;sql&#x27; while reviewing their code and seeing them do joins in the application logic. reply yyyk 3 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on what age you are and whether you work with documents. If you started working in the industry past 2010 and didn&#x27;t have to work with generating&#x2F;reading (X)HTML&#x2F;OOXML&#x2F;ODF than it&#x27;s rather likely you&#x27;ve never had an experience with XML (fortunately SOAP was deprecated very quickly). reply bradgessler 5 hours agorootparentprevMy issue with xml for configuration files is not understanding when to use elements vs attributes to describe data.The nice thing about JSON, TOML, and YAML is they have implicit structures for arrays and key&#x2F;values encoded within them.XML has a lot of different ways of representing data that way, which is what makes it a challenging configuration file format. reply KnobbleMcKnees 3 hours agorootparentThat arrays point is such a weakness in XML that I rarely see addressed. Arrays and lists are such a common data structure in almost every programming language of the past 40 years that not having first class syntax for representing them is absurd and a huge weakness that makes XML a non-starter for me. reply chii 2 hours agorootparent> not having first class syntax for representing themi think you&#x27;re mixing representation of xml data vs the representation of them in a programming language.XML does have arrays. They care called child elements. reply KnobbleMcKnees 5 minutes agorootparentNo you&#x27;ve misunderstood my point. This doesn&#x27;t work for cases where one child is in fact a property that is a complex object.XML claims to solve the problem of attributes vs children but then falls short at the first hurdle by not discerning between a single complex object as an attribute and an array of complex objects as children.JSON and YAML do not have this problem as they are explicit in their representation.YAML example: parent: child: namevs parent: - child: nameTry converting each of these to JSON. The former will give you an object property called child, the latter will give you an array property called child with one element nickpp 2 hours agorootparentprevAren&#x27;t XML child elements pretty much the most verbose way you can represent an array though? reply krab 2 hours agorootparentI think the verbosity is not a problem. For example if you compare [\"string1\", \"string2\"]tostring1 string2 then each element has about four bytes overhead ( instead of \" andinstead of \",) plus some overhead for the list itself that may be offset by putting the name of the list itself into the element.However, the issue is that you have to write a custom parser. There is no direct mapping between your data structure and the XML file. This developer ergonomics is a big win for JSON and consequently YAML. reply chii 2 hours agorootparent> There is no direct mapping between your data structure and the XML file.i think that&#x27;s by design tbh.it&#x27;s only a big win for JSON (and YAML) because the default case works OK - but every time someone has a problem parsing numbers in JSON (because the value is bigger than Integer.MAX in the host language), this is the cause. reply krab 2 hours agorootparentYes, I understand that (and I like XML as a format and XSLT 2.0 as a language). However, from the popularity of JSON, it seems that for most cases it&#x27;s the easier choice.Take any random REST API for example. If it returns JSON, you can integrate it more easily than if it returned XML. If you need special cases like large numbers (or date-times), you handle only those. replywokkel 3 hours agorootparentprevThe main reason i avoid any typeless language is dates... how do i represent a date&#x2F;time including a time zone has been badly reinvented so many times. A string type is never the way to go there in my opinion. reply Smaug123 35 minutes agorootparentOne of the classic lessons of the Falsehoods Programmers Believe about Time is that in general you can&#x27;t correctly do better than simply storing the user&#x27;s input (and the instant and place they entered it from) verbatim, unless you know something more about what they were entering. It&#x27;s usually fine to store times in the past as a timestamp since the epoch plus a location, but the meaning of \"2025-01-28 15:00 in Europe&#x2F;London, for the purpose of a meeting that&#x27;s being hosted there but is accessible by video call\" is much more subject to change when e.g. countries change time zone. It&#x27;s also not necessarily the same as \"the absolute point in time 2025-01-28 15:00 assuming London&#x27;s time zones stay as predicted since I entered this on 2023-09-21\" or \"2025-01-28 15:00 in Europe&#x2F;London, for the purposes of a meeting that&#x27;s being hosted in Lisbon but which I&#x27;m accessing by video call from London\" (because then the Lisbon local time is the source of truth, not the London one, if Lisbon changes time zone). reply bradgessler 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s the best representation you’ve seen for dates? reply lmm 5 hours agorootparentprev> I settled on XML as the only viable option for complex user configuration, that is both readable and rich in content.How was it more readable or richer than JSON? There&#x27;s more stuff in XML, but in my experience that stuff doesn&#x27;t actually help you any. The schema validation has a lot of detail, but since it can&#x27;t access your actual system you can&#x27;t really validate in that detail (like, maybe you can validate that an ID is between 6 and 8 digits long, but really you just want to validate that it&#x27;s an ID for something that&#x27;s present in your database). The distinction between attributes and nested tags feels like it should let you express more, but in practice it usually just gives you two equally reasonable ways to write the same thing and causes more confusion. Comments and non-tag text nodes feel nice, but complicate your parsing more than they&#x27;re worth.> Sure, XML has been used in SOAP like systems, and it rightfully gets a bad rap, but that is more on the user than the technology.If one person uses the technology wrong, it&#x27;s a problem with that person, but if most people use the technology wrong, it&#x27;s a problem with the technology. reply frant-hartm 5 hours agorootparent> If one person uses the technology wrong, it&#x27;s a problem with that person, but if most people use the technology wrong, it&#x27;s a problem with the technology.But yaml has the exact same problem.

In that kind of scenario I&#x27;d wager any coherent file format would probably work, even if the configs where encoded in brainfuck in the final step.XML gets hated because we also had to read it and hand edit it as humans, when dealing with system configuration files (the source that will generate the rest of the configuration) and other upstream documents that are the base input for the system to read downstream when the GUI aren&#x27;t available for that.I&#x27;ve worked with a Symphony code base that used XML for all the routes and DI declarations, and yes it was an utter pain to write an edit tags for such simple and repetitive configurations when even an ini file would have been good enough.

To put it diplomatically though: your cadre of YAML editors, should they be moved over to using Python, are probably the ones who need the most help writing clear code. reply diarrhea 3 hours agorootparentTook the words out of my mouth.This is exactly what I fear will happen. If you look at the YAML some people produce and extrapolate that to one of the most dynamic languages available, it is going to get ugly.Programming languages for config are better, and I will throw up if I ever have to see “list comprehensions” and null checks in Terraform ever again, but it requires people who can code. If you simply replace YAML with Python and that’s folks’ first time using a normal language, it won’t work. Hence I’m happy to stay with YAML mostly, in such a scenario. reply dvdkon 2 hours agorootparentThen again, the YAML of Ansible or various CI platforms basically is code.

It&#x27;s mostly empty but could grow to ~100 lines if all config options are are changed, which realistically will be almost never. Most times it&#x27;ll be 0-20 lines long.In that case xml would be needlessly confusing.

Certainly more trivially in some environments than in others, but I suppose it&#x27;s close enough to the sweet spot of \"adding logic shouldn&#x27;t be too easy&#x2F;shouldn&#x27;t be too hard\" wether the project is already nodeish or not.The only downside is that if the objects in question happen to be properly documented in typescript, you will never want to go back.If only there had been a formalized side by side from the start between JSON, the clean serialization format, and the JSON superset for human authoring (comments and quotes anarchy) that people have been informally reinventing hundreds of times... reply wokkel 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople want flying cars and free lunches as well.

I realize I’m being forceful here, but keep in mind, you are compensated incredibly well. If it takes you another hour to save ten down the road, earn the pay. I don’t understand this aversion to tough stuff - which seems to be pretty popular here - and I’m starting to think I should interview for it a bit harder than I already do.The problem with this thinking is that you, personally, are then forbidden from arguing for the use of a strictly typed language for development because it’s the opposite position to the one you’re holding here. The exact reasons we use languages like those are the same reasons we should be explicit with our schemas. It’s unfortunate that many people try to argue both sides due to the convenience, as you say, of a single line parse, when years of experience has taught that duck anything is a bug fountain. (Not saying you are arguing both, by the way, it’s just common.)Try reading back your gripe with the following in mind: do I have a stronger complaint than “it’s difficult” here? I think you’ll find that you don’t convey one effectively. reply throwaway69467 3 hours agorootparentI have seen the same aversion and lack of pragmatism so many times it has started to impact my motivation.Examples:1. When taking over a project, developers glanced at the code and decided it would be better to spend 6 months rewriting from scratch. The end result was not more readable than the original solution and introduced a new set of issues.2. Many put too much emphasis on the worst case scenario and do not consider the average case. I worked a lot with many different XML formats and most of them were OK. Not \"fun\", but simply OK. I have to admit that I did struggle with some complex files, but there were plenty of times where the XML was simple, readable and easy to work with3. When comparing programming languages they often focus on a few features and don&#x27;t think about productivity in general. Languages like Java can actually be very productive, even if your favorite language can reduce null checks. reply sgarland 6 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. This is the same mentality that brought us MongoDB.\"Don&#x27;t want to have to create a schema? Normalization is confusing? No problem, just chuck JSON in here instead!\" reply esbeeb 7 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a happy medium to be found here - balancing ease of use, while avoiding the bug fountain. Having said that, IMHO we should err on the side of avoiding the bug fountain. Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler.Robbing the future with deceptive over-simplicity - by creating a bunch of future difficult debugging scenarios and possibly footguns - is the far worse evil, than missing out on the maximally-convenient onboarding (which can be foolishly optimized for, for the sake of short-term popularity). All such crap-tastic solutions will eventually need to be replaced again anyway, creating an endless, hellish, slow churn. reply lolxmlhateonhn 7 hours agorootparentI like rigid schemas for write and supporting both loose and rigid reads. Generally the friction in a system like that is something like the ad hoc SRE trying to load up a type stack just to interpret a protobuf log. Or Tableau. Stuff like that. That’s where people get annoyed. I think you’re right and there’s a lot of unexplored directions of simplicity.Computers that understand the shape of your data are very helpful friends when you’re pursuing goals like data locality. reply unscaled 6 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that XML doesn&#x27;t even map that well even to objects and classes, even with annotation. And XSD is quite a heavyweight format with terrible UX.I&#x27;m pretty much consistently on the strict&#x2F;type-safe side of the \"should we have a schema\" debate, but there are better options out there to maintain a consistent schema for either data interchange.JSON is simpler to map, faster to parse, simpler, more lightweight, and less dangerous to add to an online app[1]. You can also use a schema like JSON Schema for inter-app compatibility. It has replaced XML as the standard data interchange format for a reason. It&#x27;s not great for configuration files, and it&#x27;s definitely being overused nowadays, but it is a solid data interchange format.Then you&#x27;ve got binary formats like Protocol Buffers which are even more lightweight and faster to parse and (generally) have schemas that map better to typed languages.I think the OP has it right: XML is very well-suited as a generic document format. I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to YAML, because in a perfect world they shouldn&#x27;t compete in the same categories: Nobody should use XML for configuration or YAML for documents. And I also agree that there are better formats than YAML. I like the ease of writing indented multiline strings in YAML, but the fuzzy typing is pretty terrible.

I forgot to add comments to the XML representation, but I can&#x27;t edit my comment anymore. I think everyone who ever encountered XML knows how to add comments, though. JSON simply doesn&#x27;t support comments unless you use a niche JSON derivative.As for the string versus integer problem: you always need a schema, or you&#x27;ll run into very funny problems down the line.

I think YAML&#x27;s fine, and I like it way more than TOML for non-trivial files.I think Python&#x27;s pyproject.toml is a great use of TOML. The format is simple with very little nesting. It&#x27;s often hand-edited, and the simple syntax lends itself nicely to that. Cargo.toml&#x27;s in that same category for me.

I made a few modifications to Ansible syntax, largely around conditionals and loops. For YAML, I guess I like the syntax, but I&#x27;ve been feeling like there&#x27;s got to be a better way.I kind of want a shell syntax, but with the ansible command semantics (declarative, --check &#x2F; --diff, notify) and the templating and encryption of arguments &#x2F; files. reply SrslyJosh 3 hours agorootparentprev> For human-maintained config, TOML is only \"better\" when the structure is so flat that it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable from an INI file.Agree.

If it&#x27;s not ergonomic to reach for nesting people tend to be forced to rethink their approach. reply kortex 7 hours agorootparentThe problem is \"config\" means different things to different people. Some people see config as \"the collection of runtime parameters\" basically a bank of switches: Pyproject.toml is config. Others see any form of declarative structured data ingested by a runtime as config: docker-compose.yml is config.And of course to minimize impedance mismatch, the structure should be similar to the domain.So yes I want a \"config file\" to handle at least a dozen levels of nesting without getting obnoxious. reply BoorishBears 7 hours agorootparentThen I guess to frame it in your language: they want formats that encourage config files, not \"config files\".And I don&#x27;t disagree. The problems of nesting objects \"at least 12 levels deep\" aren&#x27;t going to be solved by the right format. The tooling itself needs to expose ways to capture logical dependencies other than arbitrary deep K-V pairs. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentWhat if your problem is best expressed as \"arbitrary deep K-V pairs\"? It&#x27;s going to be more common than not, nesting really is that fundamental.There is no escape, you can&#x27;t win. If you want the nesting, and assuming you can&#x27;t remove it from the problem itself (as you often can&#x27;t, or at least shouldn&#x27;t), there&#x27;s only one thing you can do: move inner things out, and put pointers in their place. This is what we do when we create constants, variables, and functions in our code: move some of this stuff up the scope, so it can be used (and re-used) through a shorthand. It loses you the ability to see the nesting all at once, but is necessary (among other reasons) when the nesting is too large to fit in your head.Of course once you do that, once you introduce indirection into your config format, people will cry bloody murder. It&#x27;s complex and invites (gasp) abstraction and reuse, which are (they believe) too difficult for normies.The solution is, of course, to ignore the whining. Nesting is a special case of indirection. Both are part of the problem domain, both are part of reality. Normies can handle this just fine, if you don&#x27;t scare them first. You need nesting and you need means of indirection; might as well make them readable, too. Conditionals and loops, those we can argue about, because together they give a language Turing-complete powers, and give security people seizures.

You have to depend on remembering where you last edited to actually find the error. My other big problem with yaml is that the ansible context is trying very hard to make it a programing language... And while it is an okish config language it is a terrible programing language.In fact this is a common problem with many complex environments.

They built an object system on top of a format that can act as a typed serialization format for generic objects and then decided to just ignore all that and implement it on top of primitive types reply hotnfresh 7 hours agoparentprevI love it. Was so happy to see that syntax when I first encountered Toml. Hierarchy is always clear without having to scroll, and snippets retain context. reply visarga 3 hours agoparentprevXML is pretty good for information extraction with LLMs. It will parse your input text into a tree structure. JSON and YAML will conjure slightly different skills from the LLM. Maybe it all comes from the slightly different applications of these formats in the training corpus. reply tomphoolery 10 hours agoparentprevin terms of something i&#x27;m shipping to users, i would much rather have to worry about the nuances of TOML than of YAML. with TOML, i don&#x27;t have to worry about e.g. remote code execution because someone figured out a clever way to trick my yaml into running arbitrary code somehow. that kind of shit is annoying.is it uglier? sure. but it&#x27;s peace of mind...in terms of config i&#x27;m using myself, say Kubernetes stuff, i really love YAML...because i know exactly what it&#x27;s doing and i generally keep things simple. it&#x27;s nice for that, it just does way too much IMHO... reply matheusmoreira 10 hours agoparentprevI agree. YAML with strict typing is nice enough.I just don&#x27;t like TOML. Just rubs me the wrong way for some reason. Don&#x27;t know why. reply wheresmyshadow 4 hours agoparentprevi agree, while YAML has its problems, it is good for human-written content, especially when it&#x27;s not too deeply nested.in short: all these have their use-cases. i use YAML where it fits and TOML where it fits better. I never use JSON because JSON is just for machines, I generate JSONs. reply throwawaaarrgh 6 hours agoparentprevYaml is literally not designed to be written by humans.

Let me sum up.>>“I need to configure this server and the server needs to know if this value is true or false.” >No, that’s bad. Don’t do that. That’s not a good use for XML.First, the primary case that people use YAML for is not appropriate for XML? I don&#x27;t agree with this but, taking it on face value, it creates a YAML strawman to attack.Second, the rest of the argument boils down to \"I don&#x27;t like how floats are parsed in my language of choice\". Guess what? You&#x27;re storing your version strings in the wrong data type. Stop storing semver and it&#x27;s variants in floating point types, that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re for.Finally, this is ultimately a \"considered harmful\" article, which is always a red flag. reply esbeeb 11 hours agoprevI, for one, am displeased with .yaml. I recently had a major footgun incident where a Debian VPS was rendered completely unbootable because of Ubuntu netplan&#x27;s highly-annoying use of YAML (where I had done the slightest misconfiguration, and to my eye it looked perfect, and my changes successfully passed the parser of \"netplan try\"). Yes, that&#x27;s right - the server needed to be rebooted in rescue mode; it wasn&#x27;t just merely stranded with no working network interfaces, where the web-based serial console would have been enough to undo the footgun gunshot. Nightmare!The solution was to uninstall netplan.io Debian package where it didn&#x27;t belong - get that YAML out of there. My hosting provider, OVH, figured it would be a good idea to shoehorn netplan - with its accursed YAML - into Debian for Network configuration. Bad move.+1 for TOML. I love it&#x27;s usage in innernet config files to set up new clients with a single generated \"invitation\" file. reply jeroenhd 10 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve broken plenty of networks by adding typos to &#x2F;etc&#x2F;network&#x2F;interfaces and then running ifdown;ifup. Misconfiguration can happen no matter what format your config files are in. reply esbeeb 10 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s what my serious error likely was: not putting double quotes around IPv6 addresses with netmask, as is seen in this example YAML snippet: allowed-ips: [0.0.0.0&#x2F;0, \"2001:fe:ad:de:ad:be:ef:1&#x2F;24\"]Note that the IPv4 addy didn&#x27;t need the double quotes, but the IPv6 addy did.The parser should have picked this mistake up, and the server shouldn&#x27;t have been crippled to the extent of needing a rescue.More docs seen here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netplan.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;netplan-yaml&#x2F; reply jeroenhd 16 minutes agorootparentYaml is like JSON, in that the format requires you to think about strings vs integers.I bet the parser did actually fail, because you can&#x27;t parse a misformed dictionary into a string. Your problem is that the tool probanlt took down the interface before trying to parse for format, and then failed to bring the interface back up.Similar to bogus data in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;network&#x2F;interfaces, resetting the network interfaces with bogus data will end up with your server having no or limited connectivity capabilities.At least with YAML there are command line parsers available to check your work. Plaintext config files often end up being a game or chance to see if you&#x27;ve got the format right. reply AceJohnny2 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, without the quotes, the IPv6 address gets interpreted a YAML mapping&#x2F;dict because of the colon(s).Perhaps the trap is the complacency that YAML induces by not requiring quotes around keys&#x2F;values, and so text risks being interpreted in unexpected ways. The infamous Norway Problem has the same root cause. reply xelxebar 7 hours agorootparent> Yes, without the quotes, the IPv6 address gets interpreted a YAML mapping&#x2F;dict because of the colon(s).This is incorrect. The colon needs to be followed by whitespace for it to indicate a key-value pair. You can check this with the reference parser (and a bunch of others!) online: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.yaml.io&#x2F;main&#x2F;parser?input=YWxsb3dlZC1pcHM6IFswL... reply TeMPOraL 37 minutes agorootparentEven in the first position? That makes it no longer be the claimed \"superset of JSON\", since (AFAIK) {\"key\":\"value\"} (with no whitespace) is valid JSON. reply AceJohnny2 4 hours agorootparentprevThat looks very interesting, but can you provide a screenshot of the results, for someone who doesn&#x27;t have Docker? reply esbeeb 8 hours agorootparentprev...and TOML would have dodged this, because it requires the double-quotes in both cases (IPv4 and 6), like you say. reply xelxebar 7 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s odd. Looks like Netplan looks like uses libyaml, and vanilla libyaml definitely parses that naked v6 addr as a plain scalar. Maybe Netplan adds an extra schema on top or something? If you know what data the bare v6 string turned into, I&#x27;d love to hear it. reply linsomniac 9 hours agoparentprevUnpopular opinion I guess, but I really like netplan. I like having the vlan, bonding, ip, routing, dns configs all in one place, and it&#x27;s worked well for me over 4-5 years. reply bravetraveler 10 hours agoparentprevRegardless of the styling, Netplan is such a footgun!I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;d define a sane schema for either.Like you&#x27;ve noticed... the trying logic is naive. IIRC if this passes the mild sniff test it will go ahead and apply.It can&#x27;t realize changes on specific&#x2F;named interfaces -- it insists on all or nothing. reply amluto 10 hours agorootparentIn my rather short experience with netplan, I found:As above, you can’t ask netplan to sanity check a config.You can’t create a draft configuration, apply it, and save it if it works well. Every self-respecting network config system since at least Cisco IOS can do this (and does it by default!).Interface renaming can’t filter by being a physical interface, which means that the system tries, and fails, to rename VLANs, because their MAC matches something that should be renamed. (networkd can handle this, but the networkd config written by netplan is wrong.)Deleting virtual interfaces (e.g. VLANs) seems to be essentially unsupported, at least on 20.04. I think it’s slightly, but only slightly, better in newer releases.Not impressed. reply bravetraveler 6 hours agorootparentOuch, quite a lot of &#x27;learning&#x27;! Color me unimpressed, too.I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy NetworkManager. I know, like all things, that is probably controversial to some.Two things I really appreciate about it: - You can &#x27;up&#x27; a connection&#x2F;interface in an idempotent way; only changing whatever is needed. - it&#x27;s *very* scriptable. Values can be given with +&#x2F;- operatorsI was surprised&#x2F;frustrated with networkd initially, but enjoy it now.It getting involved with packet forwarding was an unwanted surprise during a modernization effort. reply ArchOversight 10 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not your hosting provider that did that, it&#x27;s the Debian project. reply mkj 10 hours agorootparentDebian doesn&#x27;t usually use netplan?

JSON5 is nice too, mostly because it&#x27;s popular.IMO Jsonnet, CUE, etc are just in a different category of complexity since they include code and require a full-blown interpreter to read. reply crimsonpowder 6 hours agoparentprevXML&#x27;s biggest problem is perfectly demonstrated in Apple&#x27;s plist files.

Worse still, people felt compelled to use every feature that they could for esoteric reasons. Even worse, the big companies did not actually work well with each other&#x27;s document definitions. Even ones that were supposed to work well together.That said, you only need to look at the abomination that is an OpenAPI spec that has been annotated to work with AWS to see that the pitfalls are still mostly the same today. (I can also complain about the breaking changes from the old specs.) reply marcosdumay 8 hours agoparentXML is full of complexity that it shouldn&#x27;t have and any competitor would be stupid to adopt.For example, either your format is a programing language, or the data evaluation must never need an internet connection.

The problem is that it forces everyone to pay the costs of those things up-front, even if they don&#x27;t use or care about them. reply smarx007 4 hours agorootparentAnd because nobody wants to pay the namespace cost upfront, we all end up with vin, vin_no, viNumber, vinNum etc instead of iso3779:vin, for example.

If you know the type specify the type and YAML will happily err when you put a square peg in a round hole. Better yet actually validate the types when you ingest a document! Pfft who would bother with that? Recent versions of Ansible will now force you to do it right and not accept numbers when it expects a string. I believe the Prometheus ecosystem does it as well.When it comes to config formats this is pretty reasonable. People are just primed to expect true&#x2F;false to be reserved. --- enable_frobulator: yes use_thopojog: noThis was also the issue presented in the OP where they were mad that their version which is a string was interpreted as a number because it wasn&#x27;t in quotes.

Like why not just legislate that you can’t do the kind of tracking they are asking because I’m pretty sure literally nobody wants it… reply jjoonathan 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s exactly what they did. The cookie dialogs are almost all illegal. Enforcement is MIA.The industry collectively decided to play \"they can&#x27;t catch us all\" because the alternative was giving up the ad-driven business model and they didn&#x27;t want to do that. Unfortunately, it looks like they are getting away with it. reply dizhn 13 hours agorootparentprevThe accept button is a one time deal. You click it and never hear about it again. Deny on the other hand causes the same question to come up again and again. They want you either to get fed up and accept it or accidentally accept it. reply debugnik 13 hours agorootparent> Deny on the other hand causes the same question to come up again and again.Not in my experience. I click deny almost everywhere, even if it takes more clicks, but rarely do I see the banners come up again in a second visit. Tracking my choice is a functional cookie after all.I do, however, simply close the tab when the banner occupies half the window (or I use reader mode to bypass it altogether).

I think they just settled of court in a similar matter. reply debugnik 1 hour agorootparentOh that I fully agree; sorry, I was only thinking cookies. I too have got Android devices with built-in crapware that ask for permissions and ad tracking again and again because I keep tapping \"no\". Chinese brands are the worst at this, even the damned built-in file manager has ads. reply Silhouette 11 hours agorootparentprevSo they only pop up every time if you force them to respect your decision by not letting them store persistent cookies in the first place? To avoid the recurring interruptions all you have to do is trust the organisation that&#x27;s employing this user-hostile pattern in the first place to respect your wishes and not be user-hostile more discreetly instead?I&#x27;ll tell you what is a one time deal: the explicit do not track preference that my browser automatically sends to every site I visit. They already know they don&#x27;t need to bother asking me about these things every time. They just choose to overlook it. reply samtho 8 hours agorootparentIt is my understanding that GDPR and CCPA both specify that consent is only needed for non-essential cookies (or some nebulous term they use) and you can make the argument that storing user preferences are essential. The laws in question don’t, however, have as strong language for the reverse case, i.e. you can ask for consent for cookies that may be considered essential and thus forbid yourself from storing the preference to deny resulting in harassment. reply bad_user 13 hours agorootparentprevI the dialog comes up repeatedly after deny, that&#x27;s illegal in the EU actually.Also, I don&#x27;t know what the posters above are talking about, but more and more dialogs these days have a working Reject All button. Including that of Meta or Google. Bad actors are still left, but still. reply OkGoDoIt 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the cookie tracking whether or not you responded isn’t saved if you reject cookies? reply bad_user 13 hours agorootparentCookies for functionality that&#x27;s necessary, i.e. expected by the user, are completely legal without any consent or notification.Fact of the matter is, when you see a cookie banner, that&#x27;s always for spyware shit that the service doesn&#x27;t really need to serve the user (e.g., analytics, tracking). reply swores 13 hours agorootparent> Cookies for functionality that&#x27;s necessary, i.e. expected by the user, are completely legal without any consent or notification.No that is not the case, though it&#x27;s easy (and common) to mistakenly think that - in part due to the confusing nature of the various regulations and in part due to how frequently companies and websites purposefully misinterpret them for their benefit.Firstly, there are legitimate reasons to ask for consent to store user data that relate to providing a service (eg if the service is storing a user&#x27;s personal medical records, or many many possible functions within many services).Secondly, even without personal information being used or stored, and therefore no GDPR to worry about nor consent needing to be sought, cookies are a separate matter. A different EU law (the 2009 update of the \"ePrivacy Directive\") requires EU users be notified of any cookie use - even something as obviously reasonable as providing the functionality of a \"keep me logged in\" checkbox, if you&#x27;re doing it with a cookie (edit: or even something equivalent like using fingerprinting on the server side to remember people) you need to notify the user.See, for example, the UK ICO&#x27;s (the relevant department for dealing with UK&#x27;s implementation of GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, etc) guidance on it:> This means that if you use cookies you must:> - say what cookies will be set;> - explain what the cookies will do; and> - obtain consent to store cookies on devices.> PECR also applies to ‘similar technologies’ like fingerprinting techniques. Therefore, unless an exemption applies, any use of device fingerprinting requires the provision of clear and comprehensive information as well as the consent of the user or subscriber.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;direct-marketing-and-pr...A cookie being necessary for actual core functionality does allow skipping over requiring consent, but not skipping the notification part. Which is why 14 years ago, years before GDPR arrived, EU sites all started putting \"cookie banners\" up, most of which didn&#x27;t ask for consent and just appeared on the first site visit for each user even if they didn&#x27;t actively dismiss it, since showing it once was widely considered to count as having notified.Sorry for such a long comment, but the fact that these topics are so widely misunderstood means I think it&#x27;s important not to make things worse by accidentally spreading misinformation like that in your comment. reply bad_user 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m going to repeat … cookie banners are not necessary for functionality that the user expects to receive as part of the service provided. And yes, this is part of the ePrivacy Directive. And indeed, the cookie banners that only “notify” users, without requiring an acknowledgement to proceed, are not even legal.Go to any Mastodon website right now. Why aren&#x27;t they providing a cookie banner for notifying that session cookies are used?Go to GitHub for that matter. Why aren&#x27;t they providing a cookie banner? We know why: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.blog&#x2F;2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you&#x2F;GDPR isn&#x27;t concerned with cookies. What the GDPR cares about is personal data and having a legal basis for processing. And “consent” is only one of those legal bases.You don&#x27;t need consent, for example, for using a home address for delivering pizza, since pizza delivery can&#x27;t work without that home address. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s called a “legitimate” interest. You also don&#x27;t need consent for keeping logs for security purposes, if the retention rate is reasonable (e.g., 3 months). You also don&#x27;t need consent if the law demands that you keep certain records for fraud detection by law enforcement (e.g., banking).--->A vast majority of websites needing cookie banners or GDPR consent dialogs are doing spyware shit, which includes Google Analytics (85% of all websites), or behavioral advertising via RTB platforms. And the few websites that don&#x27;t probably haven&#x27;t spoken with lawyers yet. reply swores 13 hours agorootparentprevA cookie like that doesn&#x27;t need to contain any personal information and therefore does not need a user&#x27;s consent to store under GDPR. As a cookie it does need the user to be notified (ePrivacy Directive aka its 2009 \"cookies law\" update), but that is&#x2F;can be covered as part of the original request that the user clicks to reject optional cookies.The only reason to forget that a user said no is because it&#x27;s a hostile interface designed to get users to give in and give their \"consent\". reply doublerabbit 13 hours agorootparentprevNah. They normally have the default \"allow system cookies\" which is untickable.What annoys me are the \"Legitimate Consent\" option on all 9000 cookie vendors. There never seems to be a \"No to all\" button on those. reply bad_user 13 hours agorootparentThe IAB consent dialog is the worst, as it makes you consent to the entire advertising industry.Those legitimate interests, however, are bullshit. Just because they claim it, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true.For instance, a DPA just claimed that Facebook can&#x27;t claim a legitimate interest for behavioral advertising, so they&#x27;ll have to ask for consent. Which will be interesting, because they won&#x27;t be able to refuse service to those that decline. reply swores 13 hours agorootparentprevThe \"legitimate interest\" part of GDPR is just horrifically abused by so many companies, who act like it&#x27;s a magic two words which allow them to collect personal information without consent because they said \"ooooh we really do have a legitimate reason for this data\" which is against both the spirit and the wording of the GDPR.I really hope to see a few big cases where the EU fines companies for that, so that everyone else gets the picture and stops hiding behind legitimate fucking interest. But I don&#x27;t know why that hasn&#x27;t happened yet, hopefully it&#x27;s just slow moving rather than a case of the laws implementing GDPR being fuzzy enough that countries are worried they wouldn&#x27;t win the case in courts. (But if that were the case, hurry up and update the law!)&#x2F;side note: apologies on behalf of my profession, since it&#x27;s largely marketing people who&#x27;ve led to these shitty practises. We&#x27;re not all assholes, some of us do respect people&#x27;s data, rights, and (lack of-)consent. reply bad_user 2 hours agorootparentMeta&#x2F;Facebook was told that they don&#x27;t have a legitimate interest in behavioral advertising. They&#x27;ll need to ask for consent: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisisunpacked.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-eu-war-on-behavior...Meta also broke the record for the biggest fine this year (1.2 billion). The fines are coming, and if they go after the biggest players first (e.g., Meta, Google), it will send shockwaves through the entire industry.When GDPR came into effect, being close to the advertising business then, I know some companies that closed shop in EU. But enforcement has been very moderate, at least in the beginning. There&#x27;s also the issue that some DPAs are more active than others. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to set precedents, and EU countries may find that these fines are a nice way to add to the public budget. replypcl 13 hours agorootparentprevConsent-o-matic has really improved things for me.

Fun project, and most of the hardware necessary is already out there. reply guidoism 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been hoping somebody would do that.I have a only half-joking business idea to build high-quality physical controls for all of the crap touchscreen shit being forced upon us. High-end ovens for example rarely now include physical controls so (I&#x27;m looking at you Miele) so I would like an aftermarket thing that sticks on to the outside of it. Maybe even directly over the touch screen. Actually, hmm, that&#x27;s a good idea. Maybe we need a device that is the size of various standard touch screens that can read the contents of the screen, interpret them, and then have some sort of way to do capacitance touch on the screen.

Important functionality baked into the head unit (Volvo, for example, has paths to configure some safety options, trip&#x2F;mpg display, etc). Integration for steering wheel controls, rear displays, backup cameras. And more that I&#x27;m missing off the top of my head.For some vehicles, some of the above have options to tie in with a 3rd party setup, others don&#x27;t. reply RajT88 12 hours agorootparentMy current head unit for (admittedly a 10 year old VW) does all of those things.Backup camera, steering wheel buttons, MPG, fuel level, low tire warnings...It&#x27;s actually really impressive for for $190 I spent on it.The only thing which it disabled when I replaced the head unit was the built-in handsfree bluetooth stuff. It all goes through the stereo now (and doesn&#x27;t work that great). YMMV on these aftermarket head units.A lot of the stock head units look like weird sizes, but it&#x27;s really just trim on the front of it looking highly custom. Aftermarket units sometimes (often?) come with matching trim pieces to make it look OEM. reply tyingq 12 hours agorootparentSure.

It&#x27;s like they build these products with complete disregard for user choice. \"We don&#x27;t care that they decline, show it again until they submit\". I&#x27;ve been a developer of products that do this, and it&#x27;s never a bug, it&#x27;s always intentional.

Obviously YMMV but generally speaking the emissions \"cost\" of manufacturing and delivering the car in the first place is huge, and the way the numbers work out, it&#x27;s better to amortize that over as long a time as you can than it is to frequently buy a replacement, even if it&#x27;s electric. reply avar 14 hours agorootparentYour friend may understand environmental science, but clearly not economics.If you don&#x27;t keep your car you&#x27;ll sell it. You won&#x27;t be moving the needle on how long it&#x27;ll take to amortize that initial manufacturing cost, it&#x27;ll just happen with someone else driving it.Likewise if you don&#x27;t buy a new car someone else will, you&#x27;re not going to move the needle on the overall supply.I don&#x27;t recommend buying new cars, but if you consider the above it&#x27;s pretty much pollution-neutral.All you&#x27;re really doing is paying a premium in order to be the first in a long line of owners to drive that vehicle. reply PopAlongKid 13 hours agorootparentYou appear to be making an unfounded assumption that regardless of how many owners it has, any given vehicle will remain on the road the exact same number of years.If an owner decides to keep and maintain their car longer than they would have in the past, that car will stay out of the junkyard longer and therefore reduce the need to produce new cars. They will use some of the money they would have spent on a new car to keep the old one going longer, and still pocket the rest of it as savings. reply avar 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;ll average out.It&#x27;s no more likely on average that the current owner is an enthusiast that&#x27;s extending the usable lifetime of the vehicle than the next owner. reply rurp 13 hours agorootparentprevMost households keep a fairly fixed number of vehicles. Selling more moderately used vehicles into the used car market will result in more old vehicles being retired sooner. reply seanmcdirmid 13 hours agorootparentprevThat assumes that the used car market isn&#x27;t a thing. Richer people (those who can afford new cars) keeping their cars as long as possible would definitely reduce overall demand for cars by killing the used car market, which I guess is also a good thing if you care about the environment (but in a harsh unintended consequence kind of way). Or perhaps new economy cars would become a thing again, kind of like the ones they drive around in China (or Japan). They aren&#x27;t designed to last more than 4-6 years anyways. reply 1270018080 14 hours agorootparentprevI like the idea that plug-in hybrids are the best choice. Battery supply is the limiting factor, so 100 plug-in hybrids that can do 50 miles of electric driving are overall better than 10 electrics that can do 500 miles.Especially since basically 99% of drives are under 50 miles. reply kwhitefoot 13 hours agorootparentPlug in hybrids would be the best choice if anyone actually plugged them in. Most PHEVs here in Norway are leased and exist only because they are cheaper than the petrol version. The leasing companies say that only a small fraction of them are ever charged. reply version_five 14 hours agorootparentprevThe real impetus behind electric cars is vendor lock in and monitoring. It brings a clean slate to the currently robust repair market. reply Tanoc 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a minor reason. The major reason is profit margins. It costs a lot less to make an electric vehicle than an internal combustion vehicle because the drivetrain and control systems are so much simpler. Since Tesla made electric vehicles seem more \"premium\" that also set up the expectation to the buying public that electric cars should cost more. So an electric vehicle costs $9,000 to make compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle costing $14,000, but the EV sells for $60,000 while the ICE one sells for $46,000. That&#x27;s also the reason why sedans, stationwagons, hatchbacks, coupes, and minivans are being phased out in favour of trucks, CUVs, and SUVs. Despite costing as much or less to manufacture, public perception allows the manufacturer to charge more.That said, considering that most repairs are done to transmissions, fuel systems, and body panels (interior and exterior), cutting out everything but the body panels also cuts into the profits of dealership service centers. That&#x27;s beginning to drive up the costs even more because the dealerships are padding the lot sales price with their markups to cover the loss that happens in the service department with EVs. People are starting to want a direct sales model like Tesla does, but that causes even more problems because direct sales cannot account for local market conditions or quick economic downturns the way dealerships can. Plus you get the problem of \"When the hell am I getting my car back?\" when it needs repairs or service because you have to ship your car off somewhere far away where they&#x27;ll get to it as the backlog allows. A la Rivian and Tesla. Neither the customers or the manufacturers want a Rivian&#x2F;Tesla repair center situation. reply belltaco 13 hours agorootparent> So an electric vehicle costs $9,000 to make compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle costing $14,000, but the EV sells for $60,000 while the ICE one sells for $46,000Automotive gross margins don&#x27;t seem to reflect those numbers. Tesla&#x27;s are around 25%. reply fomine3 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know how you ignored battery costs reply Tanoc 9 hours agorootparentHilariously batteries, even being as expensive as they are, cost less per produced vehicle than an ICE drivetrain thanks to emissions and crash regulations. In the U.S. very single engine and transmission combination for a given vehicle has to be tested individually for both fields. That drives the cost of any new generation of a given car up considerably. Chrysler&#x2F;FCA&#x2F;Stellantis kept ancient LX cars alive with just facelifts because paying the penalties was cheaper than testing new vehicles. We don&#x27;t get a lot of cheaper world brands like SEAT or Japanese kei cars because of that, too. We lost the Focus and Fiesta in North America because Ford foolishly spent that money on the cost-amortized EcoSport instead. The companies believe it&#x27;s too expensive to \"federalize\" these cars, and so they just don&#x27;t bother with them. Meanwhile Volkswagen rushed the id.Buzz right over the Atlantic the moment they finished it because they only had to test one configuration. Same with the Fiat 500E and the Toyota bZ4X. No EPA emissions testing and only a single NHTSA test round make those EVs so much cheaper than testing the twenty six of the Toyota RAV4 or the twelve of the Volkswagen Transporter. reply vel0city 13 hours agorootparentprevBut vendor lock in and monitoring is happening even on non-electric cars, and there&#x27;s nothing inherent to electric vehicles that requires the lock in and remote monitoring compared to any modern ICE. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 14 hours agorootparentprevIt truly sucks that they require a pound of flesh here, you can&#x27;t have this nice thing without selling your soul.

Imagine being able to both see the road AND quickly sketch out an idea with a co-worker on the windshield during your commute! reply vel0city 13 hours agoparent> Imagine being able to both see the road AND quickly sketch out an idea with a co-worker on the windshield during your commuteThis is quite a disingenuous take on the screens in a car though. They usually only allow limited interactions while the vehicle is in motion, so that example of sketching out an idea with a coworker already isn&#x27;t supposed to be happening with the current systems while the vehicle is in motion.My passenger can&#x27;t type something while the vehicle is moving, and if they scroll through lists too fast it&#x27;ll go into a timeout mode for a few seconds because it assumes the driver is paying too much attention to the screen. Coupled with driver attention tracking systems on current Euro cars (and it sounds like future US cars as well) it can really enforce that a driver doesn&#x27;t pay too much attention directly to the screen or other things in the car. reply lunias 11 hours agorootparentIs it disingenuous? I&#x27;d say perhaps hyperbolic or satirical. I remember a time when cars came with DVD players that wouldn&#x27;t play if the car wasn&#x27;t in park. People didn&#x27;t like that so they worked around it. The lockout systems that you describe sound like the impetus for a market of bypasses. I would argue that if such restrictions are necessary then we should reconsider if the screen which necessitates them is necessary.We seem hard-pressed to consolidate all of a car&#x27;s functionality into a touch screen, but the UX is often much worse than a physical input whose position never changes and can be felt with your fingers in the dark or in situations where you cannot look at it. This consolidation also seems like it creates a single point of failure: what happens if your screen breaks?It all seems like tech for tech&#x27;s sake, things to justify charging more and more for new vehicles while providing manufacturers with a means of pushing updates, displaying ads, and selling services to extract more incremental value from consumers.I&#x27;d like to see a car w&#x2F; a screen for a map. That&#x27;s it. You input your destination on your phone, it shows the map on the screen. The screen is for display only and it&#x27;s decoupled from all other controls in the car. reply vel0city 7 hours agorootparent> The lockout systems that you describe sound like the impetus for a market of bypasses.If we&#x27;re talking about modifying and buying 3rd party changes then the car not even having a screen from the factory is within the same world of people making changes are bad with excessive touchscreen interaction while moving.

They asked me what I knew, and I said basically singular integrals and functional analysis - no real harmonic theory at all. So they examined me on singular integrals instead, essentially. Give examples of singular integrals (Calderon-Zygmund). What theorems do you know about them, how to prove boundnedness. (I stated a T(b) theorem, which nobody seemed very acquainted with, and said with some brief explanation that knowing boundedness on L^2 - L^2 was sufficient to prove L^p-L^p for 1=5). What other simple groups do you know. (The monster? But I backed down quickly, saying I knew not how to define it.) Then the discussion meandered a bit as the professors talked among themselves whether the group of order 168 (which I mentioned) was sporadic. After this, they decided to pass me, though they said that my harmonic analysis was far from satisfactory. :( They didn't ask any real or complex analysis, but I guess from my handling of the special topics they decided that wasn't necessary.

Philosophy was simply the systematic study of the world, including physics, logic, and math, as opposed to theology or learning an applied professional trade such as medicine, law, or architecture.The terms we use to differentiate fields of study are still shifting. Nobody uses the term \"naturalist\" anymore, at least not to refer to a scholarly field. There&#x27;s often a huge overlap between math and various other fields. I&#x27;m not sure the recent explosion in degree names is any better than using Ph.D. It&#x27;s tempting to suggest that fields like Art History and English Literature should be differentiated from [modern] Physics, but ideally scholars in all those fields should be (and often are) using many of the same analytical techniques. And realistically, I doubt usage of a shared signifier, Ph.D, is causing any consequential confusion. Arguably, as specialization increases the value of using Ph.D increases--it general implies someone has attained the highest credential in their field of study, whatever the field. reply thristian 5 hours agorootparentprevIn the medieval university system, there were four fields of knowledge: medicine (MD), law (Juris Doctor, or JD), theology (ThD), or philosophy (PhD).In the centuries since, new kinds of knowledge were discovered, but they generally got squeezed in as sub-categories of philosophy, so when you specialise in them, you get a PhD. reply thsksbd 6 hours agorootparentprevPhD is a license to teach (i.e. doctor) philosophy. Specifically, in \"science\" fields, natural philosophy.Natural philosophy was the original (and i think better) name for science, especially physics. It was understood to be an important subbranch of philosophy.I think its better name because it elucidates an important epistemological difference: science is a method, not knowledge. I learn science when I learn about experimental design. Im not learning science when I learn about evolution; rather Im learning a theory, very likely to be true, that is almost impossible to put under scrutiny using the scientific method.The Pythagorean theorem has no science and is 100% true.

Once you mathematically prove something, you proved that a statement is true when given a certain set of axioms. This is enough in Mathematics, like your example of the Pythagorean theorem, but it isn&#x27;t in Physics. The reason being that proving something Mathematically consistent isn&#x27;t enough to prove that it reflects what happens in the real world. A famous example in pop science of this is string theory.I also have some doubts about what you say regarding evolution theory, but I&#x27;m not familiar whit how biologists verified it. Maybe every time a new fossil is found we can consider it as an experiment that can add a data point in favor or against the theory? reply zem 1 hour agorootparentprev> Im not learning science when I learn about evolution; rather Im learning a theory, very likely to be true, that is almost impossible to put under scrutiny using the scientific method.the very definition of a \"theory\" in the scientific sense of the word (e.g. \"theory of evolution\") includes the ability to test it using the scientific method.the wikipedia page goes into great detail: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scientific_theoryand this is a good brief explanation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170709065046&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.ke... reply defrost 11 minutes agorootparentIndeed.Jumping to specifics, Evolution Theory is relatively easy to demonstrate on short time scales of under a year with fruit flies, and can also be demonstrated on longer timescales of five, ten, thirty years given patience .. with ongoing field observations of some two centuries now in various locations.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-scientist.com&#x2F;news-opinion&#x2F;fruit-flies-evolv... reply pasc1878 18 minutes agorootparentprevWhy specifically in science.PhD is the degree you usually get at that level for English, Classics, Economics, Histrory etc..Some Universities use DPhil (Oxford) for all these but I know of no other degree at that level except for those two (MD is effectively lower and DSc is usually some form of honourary degree and I am not certain what LLD is) reply riffraff 3 hours agorootparentprevHoly cow, I had not until today realized that \"doctor\" comes from \"docere\" (to teach). Thanks for enlightening me! reply lordnacho 2 hours agorootparentWhich makes you wonder why a medical doctor is called that? reply christudor 2 hours agorootparentBecause doctor comes from the passive doctus (&#x27;having been taught&#x27;, i.e. learned) rather than the active docens (&#x27;teaching, instructing&#x27;). reply Jensson 2 hours agorootparentprevFor the same reason social science is called science. When words start to become prestigious many will attach that word to what they do. reply irrational 5 hours agorootparentprevApparently it is also a license for your brother in law to brag about having a PhD in economics, despite not being able to hold a job for more than 2 years and currently working as a manager at a pest control company after being laid off from his last job. reply auggierose 10 minutes agorootparentThis is hilarious. Whereas I have to say, when holding a job means doing what other people want you to do, well, which person of high intelligence would be interested in that? reply netrus 2 hours agorootparentprevI can imagine that many great academics might have difficulties &#x27;holding a job&#x27;. A PhD is certainly something to be proud of, just as running a marathon, raising a great child or having a great corporate career. reply Nevermark 5 hours agorootparentprevPhysics was also philosophy for eons in that theories were on par with hard knowledge about the gods and mermaids.Most early physic had surprisingly little explanatory or experimental connection to the actual physical world.But it often made up for that with a solid grounding in popular mythology and the produce of some extraordinary imaginations.You know, like philosophy! reply puzzledobserver 8 hours agorootparentprevThe term philosophy is used in the original Greek sense, \"love of knowledge\". As opposed to, Wikipedia tells me: theology, medicine and law. I guess it also has something to do with philosophy in the early sense of the word, before natural philosophy branched off and became what we today call the sciences. reply tantalor 8 hours agorootparentprevThe \"philosophy\" in PhD refers to philosophy&#x2F;wisdom in general (philos=love, sophia=wisdom) not the specific academic discipline. reply fsckboy 6 hours agorootparentprevPhilosophy is the study of everything that is not well understood or is difficult to understand, even the study of study itself. A good way to think of it is, \"philosophy exists only in the gaps\", the gaps in our understanding. What is the nature of matter, can you take clay and keep dividing it in half and in half? When we didn&#x27;t know the answer, only speculated about it, it was philosophy. Now that we know the answer, it&#x27;s physics. But unknown answers in physics are still considered philosophy, such as whether or what would it mean if time can run backward.This implies philosophy and philosophers will disappear once we know everything, which could by some be considered one of the rewards of this quest for truth.BTW, many institutions today offer the ScD degree, doctor of science; it is generally equivalent to a PhD, though in some places it can be considered \"higher\" reply liamwire 8 hours agorootparentprevPartially, it’s tradition at this point, but it’s also worth pointing out that a PhD isn’t the only doctorate, see e.g. DBA, EdD, JD, MD, etc. reply jvvw 6 minutes agorootparentAnd some universities still award a DPhil rather than a PhD (in the UK I believe Oxford and Sussex do - I have an Oxford DPhil and I always have the very mild quandary of whether to call it a PhD or DPhil - everybody knows what the former is and it is equivalent, but I feel like I am being inaccurate if I call it that!) reply engineer_22 8 hours agorootparentprevEarly in the tradition of thinking, practitioners of thinking were called philosophers. In those times there was no distinction between the physics of the world and of the mind, physics and metaphysics were one in the same. As philosophy evolved, new branches became distinct, mathematics, physics, and later chemistry and others.The basis of all of these branches of the sciences owe their place to the work done by the early thinkers who established the ways of knowing. It is in the method of knowing that the highest degree in academic sciences is a Doctor of Philosophy. By obtaining the degree you have proven you are capable of establishing \"knowing\". Which is to say, you can reason. reply dotancohen 55 minutes agorootparentnext [–]> Which is to say, you can reason.I find this sentence a very concise phrasing for how I appreciate those with a degree vs. those without.

But in practice it has to be more restricted, that&#x27;s why they ask him what he prepared: it could be potentially anything, but to practical reasons they have to restrict it to a few subjects. Still more fields than what is covered by a single course. Or at least this is my interpretation. reply bmitc 48 minutes agorootparentI knew what you meant, but as I said, these type of exams are not at the end of a PhD program. At Princeton, it appears that the general exam occurs after year one or two: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.princeton.edu&#x2F;graduate&#x2F;requirements reply bmitc 1 hour agoparentprevI think these are normally referred to as oral exams. Most PhDs go from qualifying exams to oral exams to thesis defense. reply CraigRo 6 hours agoprevFirst of all, nobody ever passed these exams with flying colors unless the examiners wanted that to happen or were having a bad day. Assume that there are three full professors testing you, and they have an average of 20 years each of post-graduate experience. That&#x27;s 60 years of reading -- no way that a 2nd or 3rd year graduate student can keep up. Part of the process is humiliating the students a bit -- they did this for everyone.They also had a language requirement, which was often fulfilled by memorizing the 500 most common words in a foreign language as well as 300-500 common math terms in that language; there was a library of prepared crib sheets for these. It was kind of a running joke in that it tested your ability to translate an article from German&#x2F;Russian&#x2F;French into English sufficiently well to explain it to a bored examiner, but most of the students kind of looked it as a kind of giant &#x27;Wheel of Fortune&#x27; exercise in intelligently guessing between the revealed clues.Second, some of the other graduate students basically went insane studying for this -- one locked himself in a room with a 30 day supply of microwavable meals, and another locked himself in his dorm and (having read MicroSerfs) only ate 2 dimensional food slipped under the door. A lot of this was immature students trying to out-do each other in commitment and probably didn&#x27;t markedly improve pass rates.Tao matured, but mostly because he got older -- there were finally reasonably smart people his age studying with him. He also used to hang out with John Conway a lot, and Conway was going through his own problems; he spent more time with the &#x27;more conventionally normal&#x27; faculty and that probably rubbed off. reply tester756 1 hour agoparent>Assume that there are three full professors testing you, and they have an average of 20 years each of post-graduate experience.

SeaGOAT is a local search tool that leverages vector embeddings to enable to search your codebase semantically. Note: I was recently laid off my job and I am looking for new opportunities. If you need a Senior Full Stack Developer, contact me! I have experience with React, Node and Python and I'm located in Spain (European Union). 10+ years in software development professionally. Getting started Install SeaGOAT In order to install SeaGOAT, you need to have the following dependencies already installed on your computer: Python 3.11 or newer ripgrep bat (optional, highly recommended) When bat is installed, it is used to display results as long as color is enabled. When SeaGOAT is used as part of a pipeline, a grep-line output format is used. When color is enabled, but bat is not installed, SeaGOAT will highlight the output using pygments. Using bat is recommended. To install SeaGOAT using pipx, use the following command: pipx install seagoat System requirements Hardware Should work on any decent laptop. Operating system SeaGOAT is designed to work on Linux (tested ✅), macOS (partly tested, help 🙏) and Windows (help needed 🙏). Start SeaGOAT server In order to use SeaGOAT in your project, you have to start the SeaGOAT server using the following command: seagoat-server start /path/to/your/repo Search your repository If you have the server running, you can simply use the gt or seagoat command to query your repository. For example: gt \"Where are the numbers rounded\" You can also use Regular Expressions in your queries, for example gt \"function calc_.* that deals with taxes\" Stopping the server You can stop the running server using the following command: seagoat-server stop /path/to/your/repo Development Requirements: Poetry Python 3.11 or newer ripgrep Install dependencies After cloning the repository, install dependencies using the following command: poetry install Running tests Watch mode (recommended) poetry run ptw Test changed files poetry run pytest . --testmon Test all files poetry run pytest . Manual testing You can test any SeaGOAT command manually in your local development environment. For example to test the development version of the seagoat-server command, you can run: poetry run seagoat-server ~/path/an/example/repository FAQ The points in this FAQ are indications of how SeaGOAT works, but are not a legal contract. SeaGOAT is licensed under an open source license and if you are in doubt about the privacy/safety/etc implications of SeaGOAT, you are welcome to examine the source code, raise your concerns, or create a pull request to fix a problem. How does SeaGOAT work? Does it send my data to ChatGPT? SeaGOAT does not rely on 3rd party APIs or any remote APIs and executes all functionality locally using the SeaGOAT server that you are able to run on your own machine. Instead of relying on APIs or \"connecting to ChatGPT\", it uses the vector database called ChromaDB, with a local vector embedding engine and telemetry disabled by default. Apart from that, SeaGOAT also uses ripgrep, a regular-expression based code search engine in order to provider regular expression/keyword based matches in addition to the \"AI-based\" matches. While the current version of SeaGOAT does not send your data to remote servers, it might be possible that in the future there will be optional features that do so, if any further improvement can be gained from that. Why does SeaGOAT need a server? SeaGOAT needs a server in order to provide a speedy response. SeaGOAT heavily relies on vector embeddings and vector databases, which at the moment cannot be replace with an architecture that processes files on the fly. It's worth noting that you are able to run SeaGOAT server entirely locally, and it works even if you don't have an internet connection. This use case does not require you to share data with a remote server, you are able to use your own SeaGOAT server locally, albeit it's also possible to run a SeaGOAT server and allow other computers to connect to it, if you so wish. Does SeaGOAT create AI-derived work? Is SeaGOAT ethical? If you are concerned about the ethical implications of using AI tools keep in mind that SeaGOAT is not a code generator but a code search engine, therefore it does not create AI derived work. That being said, a language model is being used to generate vector embeddings. At the moment SeaGOAT uses ChromaDB's default model for calculating vector embeddings, and I am not aware of this being an ethical concern. What programming langauges are supported? Currently SeaGOAT is hardcoded to only process files in the following formats: Text Files (*.txt) Markdown (*.md) Python (*.py) C (*.c, *.h) C++ (*.cpp, *.cc, *.cxx, *.hpp) TypeScript (*.ts, *.tsx) JavaScript (*.js, *.jsx) HTML (*.html) Go (*.go) Java (*.java) PHP (*.php) Ruby (*.rb) Why is SeaGOAT processing files so slowly while barely using my CPU? Since processing files for large repositories can take a long time, SeaGOAT is designed to allow you to use your computer while processing files. It is an intentional design choice to avoid blocking/slowing down your computer. This design decision does not affect the performance of queries. By the way, you are able to use SeaGOAT to query your repository while it's processing your files! When you make a query, and the files are not processed yet, you will receive a warning with an esimation of the accuracy of your results. Also, regular expression/full text search based results will be displayed from the very beginning!

You can get any arbitrary embedding, but then the cosine similarity used for nearest neighbor lookup gives a lot of false pos&#x2F;negs.*There are 2 reasons:*1. All embeddings from these models occupy a narrow cone of the total embedding space. Check out the cos sim of any 2 arbitrary strings. It&#x27;ll be incredibly high! Even for gibberish and sensical sentences.2. The dataset these SentenceTransformers are trained on don&#x27;t include much code, and certainly not intentionally. At least I haven&#x27;t found a code focused one yet.*There are solutions I&#x27;ve tried with mixed results:*1. embedding \"whitening\" forces all the embeddings to be nearly orthogonal, meaning decorrelated. If you truncate the whitened embeddings, and keep just the top n eigenvalues, you get a sort of semantic compression that improves results.2. train a super light neural net on your codebase&#x27;s embeddings (takes seconds to train with a few layers) to improve nearest neighbor results. I suspect this helps because it rebiases learning to distinguish just among your codebase&#x27;s embeddings.*There are solutions from the literature I am working on next that I find conceptually more promising:*1. Chunk the codebase, and ask an LLM on each chunk to \"generate a question to which this code is the answer\". Then do natural language lookup on the question, and return the code for it.2. You have your code lookup query. Ask an LLM to \"generate a fabricated answer to this question\". Then embed it&#x27;s answer, and use that to do your lookup.3. We use the AST of the code to further inform embeddings.I have this in my project UniteAI [1] and would love if you cared to collab on improving it (either directly, or via your repo and then building a dependency to it into UniteAI). I&#x27;m actually trying to collab more, so, this offer goes to anyone!

    "originBody": "Adi's Thoughts Home About Subscribe 20 SEP 2023 • 3 MIN READ Part 2: The Fat-Finger OR The story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world. This incident happened just a few weeks after I joined Alameda. I had just gotten a hang of our engineering workflows and was starting to wrap my head around our trading systems.At a high level, Alameda's trading operated in two modes: The main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren't placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute those trades at high frequency. However every once in a while, a trader would need to manually execute a trade. Usually this might happen if our automated trading systems were being buggy due to market volatility, or if there was an arbitrage opportunity on a venue where we hadn't set up automated trading yet. Our automated trading systems handled the vast majority of Alameda's trading. So naturally, we had sanity checks in place to make sure that the orders being sent were reasonable relative to current market prices. Not so for manual trades, which were by nature discretionary. The tricky thing about risk is that it's usually invisible, right up until it comes around and bites you in the ass. Well, on October 21 2021, an Alameda trader's finger slipped. The trader was trying to sell a block of BTC in response to news, and sent out the order via our manual trading system. What they missed was the decimal point was off by a few spaces. Rather than selling BTC at the current market price, they sold it for pennies on the dollar. The result was immediate. The price of BTC shot from a high of $65k to as low as $8k on some venues, only to be quickly restored by arbitrageurs. The sudden price movement lit crypto Twitter on fire as traders scrambled to figure out what was going on: A snapshot of crypto Twitter that day News outlets started picking up too. Binance US - which was the epicenter of the flash crash - released a statement claiming that it had been caused by one of their \"institutional traders\" who had a \"bug in their trading algorithm\". I guess Caroline had made some phone calls. Alameda's losses on the fat-finger trade were staggering - on the order of tens of millions. But because it had been an honest mistake, there wasn't much to do except to implement additional sanity checks for manual trades. And that's what we did. That's usually how things worked at Alameda - we would wait until something broke, and then rush to fix it. Which is why it took us so long to implement sanity checks that any \"traditional\" trading firm would have never started trading without. After that, it was back to business as usual. According to SBF, the utility we gained by moving fast outweighed the occasional costs we paid due to poor risk checks, hacks, and the like. This was SBF's work philosophy, and it drove the culture he created at Alameda and FTX For almost two years, the BTC flash crash incident has remained a mystery in the minds of the public. Now you know who was responsible, and what was happening behind the scenes. Liked this post? If so, drop a reply on the Twitter thread with what you want to hear about next!

One morning at the end of 10 hours dealing, I accidentally exposed a burn card which turned out to be something one of the players was representing (bluffing), with about $10k on the table. It was an honest mistake - literally a fat finger mistake. I was tired and my dexterity slipped. The player jumped up, upset the chips and started shouting that I was cheating and in league with his opponent.The manager came over to calm things down. He was the young son of a mob boss, whose portfolio encompassed a variety of entertainment franchises. In order to calm the player, he pulled me off the table, told me he believed it was an honest mistake, and then threatened my life if it ever happen again. I quit then and there. Only after I had quit and refused to come back do I think he actually knew for certain that I wasn&#x27;t pulling a scam.[edit] I&#x27;m really enjoying that people are enjoying this post, but I want to clarify what I was getting at: The original article assumes that SBF et. al. concluded by some internal mechanism that this was an \"honest mistake\", and that this is sufficient. That assumption belies the way criminal organizations actually work, which is to say, they wouldn&#x27;t assume it was an honest mistake, but they&#x27;d happily say it was one and let off a patsy if they had orchestrated it. I kind of hope I can tilt the conversation toward this aspect of the OP&#x27;s revelation? reply defrost 8 hours agoparent> Only after I had quit and refused to come back do I think he actually knew for certain that I wasn&#x27;t pulling a scam.In interactions of bluff, bluff, and double bluff suspicion never dies.Quitting indignantly on principal is either a sure sign of innocence or a true con artist cutting and putting distance from a &#x27;scam&#x27;, staying can be just as ambiguous.I&#x27;m not doubting your innocence here, just doubting that there was any action you could take that would convince a suspicious mind that you were clean.I dare say had you stayed then eventually something else would have happened around you down the track (that&#x27;s just life). Parting ways and moving on saved you from that at least. reply noduerme 5 hours agorootparentThe value of a bluff - and the value of a hand - is all about what&#x27;s in the pot. I made clear that my integrity and my life were worth a lot more than whatever fraction of $10k a crooked dealer would&#x27;ve gotten. There are plenty of guys who might try to do something like that for $5k, but I&#x27;m not one of them.I&#x27;m sure the doubt remained. What you wrote kind of reinforces my point that it&#x27;s very hard to be sure that an expensive mistake was an honest mistake.Personally, though, I didn&#x27;t quit to try to double-bluff. I&#x27;m a self-preservationist. I&#x27;m in the business of keeping myself alive, and I draw the line at working for someone who threatens me.I&#x27;m aware that quitting could&#x27;ve seemed shady, but at that point it was the least of my worries. And I doubt it&#x27;s the normal course of behavior, either, if someone were caught skimming. Someone who was guilty of malfeasance, who was offered to keep the job, would have almost certainly chosen to stay and lay low while finding some new way to scam them, because that person needs either the money or the frisson. I enjoyed &#x27;em both but I didn&#x27;t need either enough to risk my life on another accident.Someone who lacks any trust will always find reasons to assume the worst, as you say. There&#x27;s a bit of a corollary, though, in my experience, which is: People who choose to continue working around those people also mostly can&#x27;t be trusted. And I feel like the trust-less parties are well aware of that. reply thaumasiotes 2 hours agorootparentprev> Quitting indignantly on principal is either a sure sign of innocence or a true con artist cutting and putting distance from a &#x27;scam&#x27;, staying can be just as ambiguous.Who said anything about quitting indignantly on principle? The sequence of events goes like this:1. Dealer deals a round of cards, does not intend to reveal a card, but does anyway.2. Dealer is informed that if that happens again, he&#x27;ll be executed.No amount of indignation is necessary to get the dealer to quit. All that&#x27;s necessary is that the dealer believe the assurance he&#x27;s given in step 2. The mistake is guaranteed to happen again -- if the dealer was able to avoid doing it, that&#x27;s what would have happened in step 1. reply FireBeyond 9 hours agoparentprevI once watched a new (I assume) dealer make two large mistakes at a blackjack table, in Vegas, of all places.One, I had put down $500 in twenties, and he was giving me chips, except he was going to give me $1,250 in chips, like he thought they were fifties. Pit Boss looked at him, looked at the chips, \"What are you doing??\", let him fix the error.A couple of hands in, dealer gets an Ace, so he checks the hole card. Satisfied, he continues, and we all bet and play out the hand, until he goes to turn over the hold card... and has Blackjack with a King.Pit Boss again, situation explained, voids the hand and returns everyone&#x27;s stake to them.What blew my mind was that after two mistakes like this in a matter of minutes, the dealer wasn&#x27;t pulled off the table. reply noduerme 8 hours agorootparentBased on the second mistake, on pure speculation, I think that might&#x27;ve been a dealer who recently came from Eastern Europe, where typically dealer blackjacks are not announced until the end of the hand (a significant loss in EV for the players). Since never exposing a card early is the one thing that&#x27;s most drilled in, exposing one is counter to training, and that might be a hard habit to break.A lot of Eastern European casinos don&#x27;t even deal the \"down card\" for the dealer until the players have finished. reply umanwizard 6 hours agorootparent> typically dealer blackjacks are not announced until the end of the hand (a significant loss in EV for the players).That’s not just Eastern European, it’s European in general. In fact, that ruleset is well-known as ENHC (European no-hole-card) among blackjack players. reply kortilla 7 hours agorootparentprevThen why would he have checked the card? reply noduerme 4 hours agorootparentThere are some places I&#x27;ve seen in Europe that do deal the hole card, and check it (for reasons unknown), but they don&#x27;t stop the hand and flip it if it&#x27;s a blackjack. They just ask for insurance, and the insurance sits there while they let the hand play out. It&#x27;s quite disconcerting. reply viraptor 8 hours agorootparentprev> after two mistakes like this in a matter of minutes, the dealer wasn&#x27;t pulled off the table.Does anyone know what the dealer training looks like in practice? I assume people will make silly mistakes for a while. Are they expected to practice until perfection before they start working? reply noduerme 4 hours agorootparentDealing requires an exceptional amount of concentration. You need to do every player&#x27;s calculations faster than they do, while also controlling the game. But it&#x27;s a lot of rote repetition, physically and memorization. Any person can be taught to deal over a week or two, if they can concentrate. It&#x27;s just practice. But like suddenly driving a car on the other side of the road, it&#x27;s hard to switch your automatic reactions. I grew up in a family of Vegas dealers, part of the genesis of my conversation with the guy who got me dealing poker. Blackjack is the easiest... mostly it&#x27;s just simple additions, which you do the moment you deal the cards. Poker is much more about nuance and controlling and monitoring the game.Would love to have a properly trained Vegas dealer weigh in here. reply jaggederest 5 hours agorootparentprevEspecially when the pit boss catches it and it costs the casino nothing except perhaps annoying some gamblers and a few cents of expected earnings. A trained dealer must be worth much more than a few voided rounds of blackjack. reply testfoobar 9 hours agorootparentprevWould you mind explaining the second story? I don&#x27;t play casino blackjack. Isn&#x27;t the goal of the house to get blackjack? So if the dealer had Ace face up and King down, isn&#x27;t he assured to win the hand and collect all the stakes? reply Cruncharoo 9 hours agorootparentIf he has ace face up and checks and sees a king he is supposed to flip it over, show his blackjack, and take everyone&#x27;s money. He instead let them play the hand out as if he didn&#x27;t have the king. reply cortesoft 6 hours agorootparentMinor point of clarity... it doesn&#x27;t have to be a king... in blackjack, a 10, jack, king, and queen all have the same point value (10), so any one of them paired with an ace makes a blackjack. reply ziml77 9 hours agorootparentprevIf the house starts with a blackjack they collect the initial wagers from anyone who doesn&#x27;t also have a blackjack. reply noduerme 8 hours agorootparentYes... and this is a net benefit for players who might otherwise double down or split without knowing they were already beaten. Some parts of the world take away this player advantage. reply fastball 8 hours agorootparentprevI thought tie goes to the dealer, so they collect from everyone regardless? reply mbreese 8 hours agorootparentA tie is a “push” where neither the player nor the dealer wins. Everyone keeps their money (you keep your money and the dealer doesn’t pay you). reply noduerme 7 hours agorootparentExcept in some European casinos, which don&#x27;t check for dealer blackjacks before play. Under those rules - someone may correct me - a blackjack outranks any other 21, and if the dealer has a blackjack and you made a 21 with more than two cards, I believe it&#x27;s not a push and the dealer wins. I could be wrong, it&#x27;s been awhile since I played over there.They often weight the rules back towards the players in other strange ways, like, being able to double down at any time (even on the 3rd or 4th card), resplit aces, as well as surrender. replyjliptzin 5 hours agorootparentprevYour $500 is such small potatoes to them they literally do not care. There’s probably someone betting $10,000&#x2F;hand 20 feet away in the high stakes room. You can be sure that dealer never makes it to that room. reply cperciva 9 hours agoparentprevNot a poker player, so maybe I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but: How did he think you were cheating? You had no way of knowing what that card was, right? And if you did somehow know what it was, surely you could have pre-arranged more subtle ways to tip off a player you were conspiring with? reply noduerme 9 hours agorootparentI guess they thought I produced the bluffing player&#x27;s card to prevent the other player from folding. But you&#x27;re right that a dealer who was trying to do that could&#x27;ve done so in any number of subtle ways. I couldn&#x27;t really figure out why they were accusing me at the time, or what I would&#x27;ve gained from it, but it all happened very fast.There are dealers who are true shuffle mechanics and either know for sure or have a very good idea of who has what. I&#x27;m not that skilled.I re-watched the movie \"Casino\" recently, and there&#x27;s a scene where the Joe Pesci character cans a floor man for not stopping a slot machine run after the first or second time someone hits a jackpot in a night. Paraphrasing the movie: \"Either he was in on or he&#x27;s a fucking moron, either way we can&#x27;t have him here\". To bring it back to the original topic, I think in the gambling world, the default assumption is that there&#x27;s a scam and the employee is guilty until proven innocent. I wonder why that wouldn&#x27;t apply to a shady firm like Alameda, too, unless management was \"in on it\". Come to think of it, I guess that&#x27;s the point of my story, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I wrote it. reply mbreese 7 hours agorootparent> the default assumption is that there&#x27;s a scam and the employee is guilty until proven innocent.To answer your real question - my guess is that this was a place that had a history of moving fast and breaking things. But probably more importantly - there was no way for that person to benefit from the mistake. The BTC price recovered automatically through the quick arbitrage market. The only way they could have benefited would have been if they were the counter party in the sale, which is highly unlikely.Now, why FTX was a place that operated like this is another question altogether. reply noduerme 6 hours agorootparentWhy do you think they didn&#x27;t have a counterparty with a lot of purchases queued up at certain trigger levels on the exchange? It would have been an easy way to make a lot of money. Then blame a nameless employee for an honest mistake and come out looking as if they&#x27;d just absorbed a loss for moving too fast. reply thaumasiotes 9 hours agorootparentprev> there&#x27;s a scene where the Joe Pesci character cans a floor man for not stopping a slot machine runRobert de Niro. Joe Pesci plays a thug. reply noduerme 9 hours agorootparentYeah. You&#x27;re right, de Niro is the one who makes that analysis. reply gexla 7 hours agorootparentprevHe said the player was attempting to bluff. In a given set of community cards, you&#x27;re calculating the possibilities in which you can get beat. You&#x27;re also watching your opponents actions to see if their lies (bluffing) are plausible.Let&#x27;s say you have a seriously strong hand, and there&#x27;s only one way you could see that you could be beat. The opponent may have that hand now, or they may be hanging around in an attempt to upgrade to that hand while bluffing in the meantime.In some cases, the above scenario is obvious. Everyone at the table knows well enough what each player is attempting to project. Every player knows which cards to look for to be revealed. It can be devastating to the bluffing player for that card to be accidentally exposed as a burner card.Given there was a burner card exposed, then there was at least one more card to be added to the community cards. At this point, the bluffing player would be in a tough spot. The player with the stronger hand would likely be raising &#x2F; re-raising to call the bluff and &#x2F; or get more chips into the pot.Continuing the game after the exposed card would have been pointless. You also feel stupid getting exposed on a bluff, when you otherwise might not have had to show your cards. You&#x27;re probably going to be very pissed.Edit: The dealer would have had no way of knowing what the burner card was, but the dealer could have known what card the bluffing player was looking for. However, I don&#x27;t see how it would make sense to expose that card intentionally as a cheating move. Maybe the dealer could have used that as a signal to expose the bluff. My guess is the bluffing player was bluffing in an attempt to make their hand (fake it until you make it) and the other player sensed that. Maybe the other player wasn&#x27;t convinced and would have won the hand regardless. But at the point of seeing the exposed card, they both knew it was over.NOTE: We would have to know more about how this played out to do much more speculation than the above. reply noduerme 7 hours agorootparentftw, this is a perfect explanation of that hand and the betting &#x2F; emotional situation of the players.

I can&#x27;t speak for what a legitimate casino would do. reply function_seven 8 hours agorootparentprevLet&#x27;s assume the poker dealer is working a scam with one of the players, \"Sam.\" On this particular hand, the scam is falling apart. Maybe Sam didn&#x27;t pick up on a signal, or he has gotten out of sync with the plan.The dealer sees the tragedy coming down the pike, and as a last ditch effort he spoils the whole game to prevent an even larger loss from occurring after the river card.For example, on this particular hand, maybe the cards were preloaded into the deal to actually harm Sam. This was done deliberately because we need to keep some volatility across hands to make the cheating more subtle. So, on this hand, Sam is supposed to bet a little bit early, then fold. He loses some of his money, but the whole game seems on the up-and-up.Except, oh no!, Sam appears to think this is one of the planned winning rounds, so he just keeps betting! Sam has made an error, and may lose big. I (the dealer) am going to suck it up and pretend to make a mistake. I&#x27;ll get yelled at in public, but the bosses will thank me later for rescuing Sam. reply quickthrower2 6 hours agorootparentprevIf there is a bluffer on the table, revealing a burn card is going to be net neutral or negative for them.

High stakes dealers are usually more experienced and less likely to make these kinds of mistakes, but at 1&#x2F;2 or 2&#x2F;5 games (max buy-in around $500 at these stakes, so pots tend to stay under $1k), this sort of error isn&#x27;t uncommon in my experience. reply jmyeet 9 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m skeptical about the \"honest mistake\" story as it&#x27;s self-serving because an \"honest mistake\" isn&#x27;t a crime, or at least it isn&#x27;t as serious a crime.I can easily believe that development was lax without proper monitoring, controls and testing. Typically for any kind of trading system there&#x27;ll be multiple layers to help catch these kinds of errors or deliberate fraud. This could include some or all of:1. A separate system that monitors and clears orders looking for pricing mistakes;2. A risk management system that looks at your total position and can block orders if they would make your position too long or short;3. Another system might monitor actual assets vs custodial assets to see if you ever \"leak\" assets.To trade any US securities you&#x27;d have to go through SEC compliance to make sure you have sufficient systems and monitoring in place, particularly if your system is facing unsophisticated investors. Crypto has largely avoided this kind of scrutiny and rigor.Part of all this is separate systems help prevent both accidents and fraud. A pricing check in a trading system could be broken by a code change or bypassed by a malicious change. Subverting an external system you may not have access to gets more difficult. reply noduerme 9 hours agorootparentYeah, and - someone correct me - aren&#x27;t at least some of the charges against SBF related to intentional backdoors in the code? reply keyle 10 hours agoparentprevGreat story!

Was fun to feel like a gangster for an evening but ultimately not a crowd I want to spend a lot of time around. reply noduerme 9 hours agorootparentHah. That&#x27;s posh. They used to have apartments all around NYU stuffed with slot machines they brought up from Atlantic City. Club members got a key to let them just go play slots. But I never played or dealt downtown. This gem was in a basement in Harlem up on Malcolm X, steel door and heavy security, 2 blackjack tables, a couple poker tables and some slots. I knew the manager because he came every morning for breakfast to the restaurant on the upper west side where I was a waiter, and we got to talking poker every morning. He asked me to come deal, so they&#x27;d pick me up in a decked out black Lincoln Navigator with tinted windows after I changed from my waiting shift, I&#x27;d deal for 8-10 hours and make 5x as much as my regular job, and then they&#x27;d drive me back. I don&#x27;t even remember the cross street.Let&#x27;s just say your money isn&#x27;t going to anything good if you play in one of those places. reply johndhi 9 hours agorootparentWild. The slots thing - seems so easy for someone to rat on them and then so easy for the cops to break it up.The Manhattan one was poker only. Steel door with a camera, get buzzed into a second door where you talk to somebody and they only buzz you up if they recognize you.The poker room had two nice tables and a little bar where you could buy drinks. TVs playing sports. Seemed to be Asian-run. reply noduerme 8 hours agorootparentSimilar setup, this was Italian.. but yeah they used to get rooms busted by cops all the time. They had trucks full of slots. No one even sat in those places, they just went to pick up the cash every day (I know this because I accompanied someone on their rounds to pick up cash from the slot machine apartments once, and was kinda shocked that some of them had no one inside at all. Just like, some studio apartment on 14th and another on Canal and another on Ave B. Wall to wall with slightly used slots hah)[edit] There was also one night I showed up to work only a few hours after the cops had raided the poker room, and they were just getting back up and running. reply keyle 9 hours agorootparentprev> \"Build what makes you happy...\" is a darn good philosophy, btw.Thanks!

But with the start of a new NFL season, but our NFL team was buzzing for a different reason – the unveiling of our off-season updates to the beloved iPad app used by one of the major NFL teams.Our app, which was primarily used for training and past game analysis, had undergone a major overhaul, and we were proud of the sleek new UI&#x2F;UX designs. But just as the athletes started to get into the grind of their training, our office started receiving some unexpected feedback.\"Hey! The app is taking me to the wrong sections!\" one message read.\"I keep hitting the wrong button. Something&#x27;s off,\" said another.Confusion took over our team. We had spent months meticulously planning, designing, and testing these updates. Automated tests had been executed to perfection, internal testing hadn’t shown a single glitch. What was happening?Then, a video came in. It was from a coach, showing one of the top athletes trying to use our app. We watched intently as his fingers moved over the screen. The problem became immediately apparent: his fingers, sculpted by years of athletic training and naturally larger than the average, were simply too big for our redesigned interface. Every time he tried to tap a specific function, his finger would unintentionally touch the adjacent ones.Turns out, in our endeavor to create a sleeker, modern UI, we had inadvertently shrunk the size of the clickable buttons and packed them tightly in a grid. This might have looked aesthetically pleasing and worked perfectly for our testers, but for the athletes with their robust fingers, it was a recipe for frustration.We convened an emergency meeting. Our lead designer, Marcus, broke the silence, \"Our primary users are these athletes. We should&#x27;ve considered their physical attributes in our designs. It&#x27;s my oversight.\"Our project manager, Clara, nodded in agreement. \"We need to fix this and roll out an update ASAP. We can&#x27;t have the team struggling with this during their crucial training period.\"The next few days were a blur of coding, designing, and testing. With feedback from some of the players, we reintroduced larger buttons and ensured enough space between them, all while maintaining the sleek look of our new design. It was a lesson learned the hard way, but it reiterated the importance of understanding our users&#x27; needs and physical attributes.The next feedback we got was from the star quarterback, \"Perfect! Back in the game with this. Thanks, TechTouch.\"The NFL season kicked off with roaring crowds, and our app, now more user-friendly than ever, was right there with the athletes, assisting them every step of the way. reply nodesocket 8 hours agoprev> What they missed was the decimal point was off by a few spaces.

So I had to use an MS cmd-line tool to split the wim files manually and edit the install files. Why doesn&#x27;t the installer just use smaller archive files? reply pbhjpbhj 3 hours agoparentBut then you&#x27;d use the same method as installing other OS and people would realise installing a Linux distro is easy. Of course MS already made it much harder with secureboot and \"accidentally\" wiping Linux installs when you install it second.Given the massive updates you immediately have to download, and the heavy push for only installing with an online account, there seems little reason to have anything beyond a minimal net installer on the USB stick.Microsoft taught me to be this cynical about their motives over a few decades. reply vladvasiliu 3 hours agorootparentMeh, I don&#x27;t have any love for windows, but IME newish versions seem quite well-behaved regarding Linux. Sure, they&#x27;ll rewrite the UEFI boot order, but once you set it back to what you want, it leaves it alone.The one thing I absolutely hate, is the recovery partition at the end of the main C: drive. So that if you want to grow the C drive, you have to jump through some ridiculous hoops to move the recovery partition. Had they put it the other way around, it wouldn&#x27;t have been 0 pain. Even with a healthy dose of cynicism, I really don&#x27;t know what purpose this could serve. reply ThatMedicIsASpy 11 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;ve had windows break my truecrypt disc.

Annoying but not the end of the world. I&#x27;ve had issues with Windows installs in the past not knowing the file system on a drive and just using it. A reason which made me paranoid and I will always unplug drives I don&#x27;t want used during a Windows install. reply noirscape 10 minutes agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s honestly behaving better than MBR since you don&#x27;t need to boot a Linux liveUSB to fix the UEFI boot order.

We though it will be easily fixable afterwards, but it&#x27;s not - you cannot recreate it. With those gone the system cannot hibernate and it couldn&#x27;t shut down until disabling fast startup. Updates don&#x27;t work either, but it still tries doing them, fails rollbacks and restarts. Is it user error?

In fact, Windows format by defaults on NTFS with the option format on exFAT. There is no option fo format on FAT32, you need to use a specific tool. More so, most people just burn the iso to the usb, deleting everyhing on it. reply vetinari 1 hour agorootparentWindows ISO files are iso9660, so you cannot \"burn them\" into the usb; only to optical drive.For USB, Microsoft provides media creation tool, which will format the usb to FAT32, and then copy the files there. As said elsewhere in this thread, it will use esd instead of wim container, which has better compression, so it will fit.The install USB can be neither NTFS nor exFAT, because neither of these filesystems are recognized by UEFI (as mandatory filesystem, by UEFI spec; yes, some implementations can recognize NTFS, but as a system vendor, you cannot rely on that). So if you want to boot it on a all systems, FAT32 is it. reply voltagex_ 1 hour agorootparentThe Rufus author has capital O Opinions on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pbatard&#x2F;rufus&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FAQ#user-content-Blah_... reply vetinari 59 minutes agorootparentHe is wrong; UEFI does specify FAT (section 13.3). It does not prevent supporting other filesystems, as well as other partition schemes or volume formats (nothing prevents UEFI from supporting LVM, for example), but only FAT and GPT are mandatory (i.e. \"must\"). Thus only FAT and GPT are implemented in 100% of shipped computers.Yes, you can get Intel NUC and yes, it does support NTFS in UEFI. It is also compliant with UEFI (i.e. \"can\"). But is is completely useless, if you are shipping media, that should be bootable by 100% of UEFI-using machines. It is usefull, only when you are targeting such machines specifically. reply rcxdude 34 minutes agorootparentThat is exactly what he&#x27;s saying, except on top he&#x27;s saying that rufus can supply a driver for NTFS for UEFI firmware that does not support it. reply vetinari 5 minutes agorootparentHe frames it differently; more optimistic than the reality on the ground. He is also conflating things in a way that does not work (just because Intel ships something does not means that it is a standard to benchmark compliance to spec against it; it creates unnecessary confusion. Intel has a right to implement things above the spec, but it does not mean that spec mandates such things).You can ship your own filesystems, volume managers, device drivers... but they should be signed with a key trusted by Secure Boot, if you want them to be useful at all. Most users are not going to disable SB for your snowflake of efi binary; especially if it is OS installer.As a result, nobody (nobody in Spolsky&#x27;s sense) really bothers. When you are shipping bootable media, fat is good enough. It will boot your binary, do stuff it is supposed to do, and everybody goes on with their lives.voltagex_ 1 hour agoparentprevThe installer is built for the Media Creation Tool, which handles this.Other option: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows-hardware&#x2F;manufactu...Other other option: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rufus.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F; reply jcotton42 3 hours agoparentprevSo, it does... but only if it&#x27;s made using the media creation tool.

I recently formatted a pendrive on Windows and somehow mindlessly selected FAT (and ofc had troubles down the road). I probably picked a default somewhere.

UEFI will look for efi&#x2F;boot&#x2F;bootx64.efi file (on x64 arch) on your removable drive and boot that. There are no magic boot sectors anymore.The issue is with filesystems recognized by UEFI firmwares. The only mandatory filesystem is FAT32. Some implementations (e.g. Intel systems) can read NTFS, but unless you are targeting such a system specifically, you get to use FAT32, period.And here comes the issue with the Microsoft&#x27;s ISO files: the install.wim file is larger than 4 GB. It is possible to split it into multiple wim files, or recompress into esd archive (which is what the Microsoft&#x27;s tool does), thus fitting into FAT32 limit. reply baz00 3 hours agoparentprevYou can make an NTFS USB stick as well then run bootsect on it and it’ll boot. That’ll take wim files of any size. reply vetinari 1 hour agorootparentOnly if:- you want to boot in legacy mode (and your machine supports CSM)- your UEFI firmware supports NTFS (only mandatory filesystem is FAT32).Otherwise, if you want generic, UEFI boot media, you would have to find out how to boot from FAT32 partition and once your system runs, how to run installer from another partition. reply j-a-a-p 3 hours agoparentprevThere was a time when Linux distros tried to concur the desktop. For that they needed the normal user to re-install the OS.

RON AMADEO - 9/20/2023, 6:02 PM Sean Nguyen 102 WITH The LTS (long-term support) period for the Linux kernel is being cut down. In 2017, the kernel jumped from two years of support to six. Now, six years later, it turns out that's a lot of work. ZDNet reports that at the Open Source Summit Europe this week (videos will be out in a few weeks), Linux Weekly News executive editor Jonathan Corbet announced the Linux kernel will return to two years of LTS support. The plan to cut back down to two years isn't instant. The Linux community is still honoring the current end-of-life timelines, so 6.1, 5.15, 5.10, 5.4, 4.19, and 4.14 are still six years, but new kernels will only get two years. Even this six-year window was supposed to be an optional thing when it started, with the release page FAQ saying, \"Each new longterm kernel usually starts with only a 2-year projected EOL that can be extended further if there is enough interest from the industry at large to help support it for a longer period of time.\" The reality was that everything received a six-year life span, and now that will no longer be the case. Corbet cited a mix of lack of use and a lack of support for why Linux is cutting back on LTS kernels. Corbet says, \"There's really no point to maintaining [old kernels] for that long because people are not using them.\" The other big problem is the burnout from maintainers, which are often unpaid and could use a lot more support from the billion-dollar companies that benefit from using Linux. Advertisement But what about Android? Two years seems like a fine support window for PCs, but what about Android? The original LTS extension was mainly made with Android and Internet of Things devices in mind—it was announced during an Android Linux talk by Google developer Iliyan Malchev. The problem was that on PCs, two years only represents the time between kernel updates, so that's a fine timeline. Embedded devices tend not to update the kernel, though, so those \"two years\" represent most of the development cycle and the entire consumer support window, and that's not long enough. Google's LTS slide from 2017. With only two years of Linux kernel support (the blue bar), the kernel's support window is almost over by the time an Android device is developed and ready to ship. Iliyan Malchev With six years of support, there's plenty of support time for device development and the product's ownership life cycle. Iliyan Malchev (Google) Previous Slide Next Slide The original picture Google painted in 2017 was that phones take two years to be developed and that the kernel is locked in near the beginning of the engineering process. The LTS kernel would be hitting end-of-life right around when the phone finally shipped, and customers would use obsolete kernels for the lifetime of their devices. The Android kernel development process is a whole pile of forks: First, Google forks from a new Linux LTS to make the \"Android Common\" kernel, then that is sent to SoC vendors like Qualcomm and forked for each model of SoC, then that fork is sent to device makers, which fork it again for each model of device. It takes a while. Are things better in 2023? I don't know about that. The Android kernel docs have a Linux \"compatibility matrix\" for each version of Android, and Android 14—releasing any day now—still supports launching new devices with Linux 5.4, a 4-year-old kernel. That's going to start a new window of support, remember, so even with a paltry two years of ownership, that's a six-year-old kernel. That's also just for new devices. You can upgrade to Android 14 from Linux 4.14, which goes back to 2017. You can see how Google arrived at the six-year number. It's hard to know what every cheap Android phone is doing at any given time, but I assume these are all supported because they are still needed. Advertisement There are also smartwatches to consider, where things are even worse. The Pixel Watch is so ashamed of its Linux kernel that it's not even listed in the settings, but the device launched in 2022 with Linux kernel 4.19, a 4-year-old kernel at the time. Android's GKI has a bunch of modules for hardware support that you can plug into the kernel. Google Android's big advancement since 2017 is the GKI, Google's \"Generic Kernel Image,\" which cuts down on the \"fork of a fork of a fork\" Android kernel development process. That first fork, Android Common, adds all the Android compatibility stuff to Linux, so that still happens with the GKI, but fork No. 2 and 3 are for hardware compatibility, and the GKI instead moves those to modules. Further out, there is a plan to move to mainline Linux. Even GKI phones still don't do major kernel updates, though. You get minor LTS security updates, but the Pixel 6, the first GKI phone, launched with Linux 5.10 and is still on Linux 5.10. That's a 3-year-old kernel. If this trend keeps up, when it gets its last security update in 2027, it will have a 7-year-old kernel. Google has said before that major GKI kernel updates are in the plans eventually. There's even mention of major kernel swaps in the documents, but the landmark of updating a production consumer device to a major new GKI version is not something that has happened yet. Rumor has it that the Pixel 8 will have a longer support window, so maybe we'll see major kernel updates launch with that phone.

Upstream is supposed to keep marching onwards.Backporting is _so_ much work. And it&#x27;s unfortunately not sexy work either, so it&#x27;s always going to be hard attracting unpaid contributors for it.If you need stability and long term support as a customer, you have companies like RedHat or SUSE whose entire point is providing 10+ years maintenance on these components. reply structural 7 hours agoparentUnfortunately, none of these companies providing 10+ years of maintenance are doing so for most embedded devices. We either need to get SoC vendors to update their kernel baselines regularly This is hard, we&#x27;ve been trying for a decade and not seen much progress. Alternately, get them to backport fixes and patches (there&#x27;s actually been quite a bit of progress here in getting them to actually take updates from the stable kernel at all! And that&#x27;s getting thrown away now...) reply qznc 5 hours agorootparentThe effect of EU’s Cyber Resilience Act will be interesting. It requires maintenance, at least for security fixes. reply athrun 4 hours agorootparentExactly. It sounds like currently there&#x27;s no money to be made supporting old embedded devices (in the consumer space at least), because no one is on the hook for long term maintenance.Regulations _could_ change the incentives, and create a market for long term servicing. Regulations are hard to get right though... reply WJW 2 hours agorootparentOld devices getting support from the Linux team is only one of the ways this can play out though. Some other ways I can think of:- Old devices are phased out sooner.- Moving away from linux towards proprietary embedded OSes that do provide support.- No doubt some companies will try just ignoring the regulations reply robertlagrant 20 minutes agorootparentThey could also provide the devices without an OS, and point you at the recommended open source ISO to download. reply danieldk 2 hours agorootparentprevOr maybe vendors will be incentivized to actually upstream kernel patches, plus stop making 10 different models every year for weird market segmentation reasons. reply ladyanita22 1 hour agorootparentprevNobody will move out of Linux, and old devices won&#x27;t be phased out sooner, at least not in s significant manner. reply worthless-trash 7 hours agorootparentprevIf they got their fixes upstream , they would be pulled into the same build tree that centos and rhel uses. reply dcow 6 hours agorootparentWhich really makes you understand why the lgpl was a defeat. reply throwawaymqsh 1 hour agoparentprev> it&#x27;s unfortunately not sexy workWhat comprises sexy work in programming? reply xnorswap 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t know what the definition of \"sexy work\" is, but rewarding work in programming is solving interesting problems.Backporting fixes isn&#x27;t generally interesting problem solving. reply samtho 1 hour agorootparentprevNew features, typically. reply 1970-01-01 9 hours agoprevGoing back to 2017, some of you knew this was not a tenable solution: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15428340 reply ralferoo 34 minutes agoprevSome comments are saying that the 6-year LTS is needed to support older Android devices. Also, in practice most vendors don&#x27;t bother releasing updates to phones after the first 2 years, other than security updates.One possible nice side-effect of not maintaining kernels for so long and allowing people to stay on out-of-date systems would be to encourage vendors to allow users to upgrade to the newer versions of Android for more than the current 2 year life span. They are then more likely to put pressure on their component vendors to get kernel support for their chipsets into mainline so they don&#x27;t have the excuse that they can&#x27;t provide updates because the hardware isn&#x27;t support by modern firmware. reply vermaden 3 hours agoprevOn the contrary the FreeBSD project offers stable &#x27;LTS&#x27; release for 5 years each.What I mean by that is each &#x27;major&#x27; version with stable API&#x2F;ABI has a life span of about 5 years - like 5 years of 12.x version, 5 years of 13.x version, etc.... and all that with having about only 1&#x2F;10 of the Linux people count (rough estimate). reply phicoh 39 minutes agoparentA difference is that the FreeBSD has to maintain two versions most of the time and sometimes three versions.At the moment there are 12.x and 13.x. 14.x is in beta, so soon there will be three. But 12.x is expected to be dropped at the end of this year, so in 2024 it will be back to two versions.As far as I can tell there are a lot more Linux kernels in LTS at the moment. reply throw0101b 1 minute agorootparent> But 12.x is expected to be dropped […]Not \"expected\", rather than that being the policy: five years is sending.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;security&#x2F;#supDecember 2018:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;releases&#x2F;12.0R&#x2F;* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;releases&#x2F; reply ladyanita22 1 hour agoparentprevYeah FreeBSD is not happening, sorry. reply Gud 32 minutes agorootparentWhat do you mean?

Look at the release notes for FreeBSD major versions. Some folks think the release engineering team is too active and that major versions should be supported for more than ~5 years. reply TowerTall 6 hours agoprevMicrosoft is famed for their backwards combability. How do they achieve this? By hard work and a lot of \"if version == x\" spread throughout the code? Or is because of their development process or do they plan and design for backwards combability from day one? reply heavyset_go 3 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s a difference between backwards compatibility and backporting. For either, Microsoft can afford to pay engineers to maintain them.But backwards compatibility isn&#x27;t what kernel developers are maintaining, they&#x27;re backporting things like security fixes to older versions of the kernel.It would be like if a security fix is implemented in Windows 11, and Microsoft also chose to patch the same change in Windows 10. At some point Microsoft decides that older version of Windows won&#x27;t get new updates, like how Windows 8.1 stopped receiving them this January.What kernel developers are deciding is that sufficiently old enough kernel branches will stop receiving backports from newer kernels. reply knallfrosch 3 hours agorootparentWindows 8.1 was released in 2013, with suppport ending in 2023 - a 10 year support window (backporting security fixes.) And Linux cuts from 6 to 2?I think you just stressed TowerTall&#x27;s point. reply jraph 2 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think TowerTall was speaking about this.They are saying: \"Recent versions of Windows can run old programs made for old versions of Windows. How?\".The Linux kernel is very good at it because of the \"Do not break userspace\" Linus Torvalds&#x27; rule. The usual user space on top of the Linux kernel, not so much.So yes, backward compatibility and backporting are different matters.And Windows addresses them both indeed. Your parent commenter is not comparing Windows with Linux. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agorootparentprevLinux is not a company.You pay microsoft for that support.You can have 10 years support for linux, just pay red hat for it like you pay microsoft. reply diffeomorphism 1 hour agorootparentprevHow do windows kernel versions like 6.1.7600.20655 work? Maybe my google fu is weak, but from looking athttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;296020&#x2F;windows-kernel-name-v...it seems that Microsoft does a mix of backports and upgrades:> 6.1.7600.16385, 6.1.7600.16539, 6.1.7600.16617, 6.1.7600.16695, 6.1.7600.16792, 6.1.7600.20655, 6.1.7600.20738, 6.1.7600.20826, 6.1.7600.20941, 6.1.7601.17514, 6.1.7601.17592, 6.1.7601.21701So this does not look like 10 year support for the initial version but rather like switching different LTS versions over that time. Is there any data from microsoft itself on support duration, release dates, backports and how to parse these numbers? reply Kipters 1 hour agorootparentprevMicrosoft does it too, Windows 11 versions have a 2-year support lifecycle. Windows 11 21H2 will reach end of support this next october.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;lifecycle&#x2F;products&#x2F;windows... reply Dalewyn 1 hour agorootparentWindows 11 uses the NT 10.0 kernel that originally released with Windows 10 in 2015. NT 10.0 will be supported for well over a decade at this point, maybe even two.NT6.1 (Windows 7) was also supported from 2009 to 2020 (11 years!), and NT 5.1 (Windows XP) was supported from 2001 through either 2014 (13 years!) or 2019 (18 years!) depending on support channel.Microsoft will support a product for a decade if not more, assuming you&#x27;re keeping up with security updates which they absolutely will backport, sometimes even beyond EOL if the fix is that important. Linux with 2 years is a bad joke, by comparison. reply diffeomorphism 1 hour agorootparentThat only tells me something about naming? I have no clue how many LTS or non-LTS versions were between the one that shipped with windows 10 and 10.0.22621.900.

Easy in theory, hard work in practice.If you want to run applications from the 90s, you&#x27;re likely to have more success with dosbox or wine than with a plain Windows. Didn&#x27;t Microsoft completely give up on backwards emulation a few years ago and started virtualizing it instead, with mixed success?Of course, if you really want something famous for backwards compatibility, look at OS&#x2F;400 and z&#x2F;OS. It&#x27;s all layers of emulation from the hardware up in order to guarantee that an investment in that platform is future proof. It&#x27;s all expensive in the end of course, as someone has to pay for it, but they live well on the customers who value such things.

Most people get their phones from their ISP provider, so that&#x27;s the main target. They get a data plan that comes bundled with a phone and pay it off for 2 years. After 2 years they get a new plan with a new phone.Caring about long-term maintenance isn&#x27;t what most buyers do. Going SIM-only on your data plan is out of the ordinary.Also in my experience people largely pick their phones based on the surface level hardware rather than the long-term reliability. Hence why Apple keeps putting fancier cameras into every iPhone even though I&#x27;m pretty sure a good chunk of customers don&#x27;t need a fancy camera. Heck, just getting a phone that fits in my hand was a struggle because buyers somehow got convinced that bigger phone = better phone and now most smartphones on the market are just half-size tablets.That trend at least seems to be somewhat reversing though. reply rcxdude 58 minutes agorootparentprevBecause the buyers are consumer hardware companies. This means a) there&#x27;s an expectation that software works just like their hardware: they put it together once and then throw it onto the market. Updating or supporting it is not a particular consideration, unless they re-engineer something significantly to reduce costs. and b) the bean-counters and hardware engineers have more sway than the software engineers: lower cost, better battery life, features, etc on paper will win out over good software support over the life of the product. reply Hackbraten 2 hours agorootparentprevContributing a driver to mainline Linux takes significant time and effort up front. You can&#x27;t just throw anything over the Linux fence and expect that already-overworked kernel maintainers keep tending for it for the next decades.Slapping together a half-working out-of-tree kernel module and calling it a day is not only much cheaper; it also buys you the time you need to write the new driver for next year&#x27;s hot shit SoC that smartphone vendors demand. reply benj111 25 minutes agorootparentPrecisely.What would you want as a buyer. A driver that has already demonstrated that it is good enough to be included in the kernel, or one of unknown quality that may need extra work to integrate with the kernel.I get why suppliers don&#x27;t want to do the work. I just don&#x27;t understand why there isn&#x27;t enough value add for buyers to justify the premium for the benefits of a mainline driver, and&#x2F;or why sellers don&#x27;t try and capture that premium reply pritambaral 28 minutes agorootparentprevSadly, far too often, software support simply nevers enter the picture in sourcing decisions. Back when I was privy to this process at an OEM, the only factors that mattered were:1. Hit to the BOM (i.e. cost); and chip2. Suppliability (i.e., can we get enough pieces, by the time we need them, preferably from fewer suppliers).In the product I was involved in building (full OS, from bootloader to apps), I was lucky that the hardware team (separate company) was willing to base their decisions on my inputs. The hardware company would bear the full brunt of BOM costs, but without software the hardware was DOA and wouldn&#x27;t even go to manufacturing. This symbiotic relationship, I think, is what made it necessary for them to listen to our inputs.Even so, I agreed software support wasn&#x27;t a super strong input because:1. There&#x27;s more room for both compromises and making up for compromises, in software; and2. Estimating level of software support and quality is more nuanced than just a \"Has mainline drivers?\" checkbox.For example, RPi 3B vs. Freescale iMX6. The latter had complete mainline support (for our needs) but the former was still out-of-tree for major subsystems. The RPi was cheaper. A lot cheaper.I okayed RPi for our base board because:1. Its out-of-tree kernel was kept up-to-date with mainline with a small delay, and would have supported the next LTS kernel by the time our development was expected to finish (a year);2. Its out-of-tree code was quite easy (almost straightforward) to integrate into the Gentoo-based stack I wanted to build the OS on; and3. I was already up-and-running with a prototype on RPi with ArchLinuxARM while we were waiting for iMX6 devkits to be sourced. If ArchLinuxARM could support this board natively, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to port it to Gentoo; turned out Gentoo already had built-in support for its out-of-tree code.Of course, not every sourcing decision was as easy as that. I did have to write a driver for an audio chip because its mainline driver did not support the full range of features the hardware did. But even in that case, the decision to go ahead with that chip was only made after I was certain that we could write and maintain said driver. reply dathinab 32 minutes agorootparentprevbecause you don&#x27;t care to give the customer longer term software supportmany consumers are not aware about the danger a unmaintained&#x2F;non-updatable software stack introduces or that their (mainly) phone is unmaintainedso phone vendor buys from B because A is often just not an option (not available for the hardware you need) and then dumps the problem subtle and mostly unnoticeable on the userthere are some exceptions, e.g. Fairphone is committed to quite long term software support so they try to use vendor As or vendor Bs which have contractual long term commitment for driver maintaincebut in the space of phones (and implicit IoT using phone parts) sadly sometimes (often) the only available option for the hardware you need is vendor B where any long term diver maintenance commitment contracts are just not affordable if you are not operating on a scale of a larger phone vendorE.g. as far as I remember Fairphone had to do some reserve engineering&#x2F;patching to continue support for the FP3 until today (and well I think another 2 or so years), and I vaguely remember that they where somewhat lucky that some open source driver work for some parts was already ongoing and getting some support with some of the vendors. For the FP5 they manage to have a more close cooperation with Qualcomm allowing them to provide a 5 year extended warranty and target software support for 8 years (since release of phone).So without phone producer either being legally forced to have a certain amount of software support (e.g. 3 years after last first party selling) or at least be largely visible transparent about the amount of software support they do provide upfront and also inform their user when the software isn&#x27;t supported anymore I don&#x27;t expect to see any larger industry wide changes there.Through some countries are considering laws like that. reply charcircuit 3 hours agorootparentprevNot a lot of software requires a bleeding edge kernel.

The issue is that if you buy a sub €100 phone, how exactly is the manufacturer supposes to finance the development and testing of never versions of the operating system? It might be cheap enough to just apply security fixes to an LTS kernel, but moving and re-validating drivers for hardware that may not even be manufactured quickly becomes unjustifiable expensive for anything but flagship phones. reply dathinab 31 minutes agorootparentthey often can&#x27;tproprietary drivers for phone parts are often not updated to support newer kernels reply xvilka 5 hours agorootparentprev> sadly it&#x27;s not rare that some phone hardware proprietary drivers are basically written once and then hardly maintained and in turn only work for a small number of Linux kernel versions.These manufacturers should be punished by the lack of LTS and need to upgrade precisely because of that lazyness and incompetence. reply charcircuit 3 hours agorootparentWhy not blame the kernel developers for being lazy and incompetent for not offering a stable API for driver developers to use?You don&#x27;t see Windows driver developers having their drivers broken by updates every few months. reply mschuster91 2 hours agorootparent> You don&#x27;t see Windows driver developers having their drivers broken by updates every few months.At the cost of Windows kernel development being a huge PITA because effectively everything in the driver development kit becomes an ossified API that can&#x27;t ever change, no matter if there are bugs or there are more efficient ways to get something done.The Linux kernel developers can do whatever they want to get the best (most performant, most energy saving, ...) system because they don&#x27;t need to worry about breaking someone else&#x27;s proprietary code. Device manufacturers can always do the right thing and provide well-written modules to upstream - but many don&#x27;t because (rightfully) the Linux kernel team demands good code quality which is expensive AF. Just look at the state of most non-Pixel&#x2F;Samsung code dumps, if you&#x27;re dedicated enough you&#x27;ll find tons of vulnerabilities and code smell. reply dathinab 25 minutes agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s less kernel developers then a certain subset of companies providing proprietary drivers only.Most linux kernel changes are limited enough so that updating a driver is not an issue, IFF you have the source code.That is how a huge number of drivers are maintained in-tree, if they had to do major changes to all the drivers every time anything changes they wouldn&#x27;t really get anything done.Only if you don&#x27;t have the source code is driver breakage an issue.But Linux approach to proprietary drivers was always that there is no official support when there is no source code. reply mschuster91 2 hours agorootparentprev> sadly it&#x27;s not rare that some phone hardware proprietary drivers are basically written once and then hardly maintained and in turn only work for a small number of Linux kernel versions.The worst part of all of this is: Google could go and mandate that the situation improves by using the Google Play Store license - only grant it if the full source code for the BSP is made available and the manufacturer commits to upstreaming the drivers to the Linux kernel. But they haven&#x27;t, and so the SoC vendors don&#x27;t feel any pressure to move to sustainable development models. reply eimrine 4 hours agorootparentprevAfter your message I started to think about LTS with 6-years support but every 3 years a new LTS. reply LinuxBender 10 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s 2 years of the upstream LTS kernel. I would expect that major Linux distributions such as Redhat RHEL and Canonical&#x27;s Ubuntu would continue to do their extended patch cycles against one of the upstream snapshots as they have done in the past. I think 2 years for upstream LTS is probably fine if the vendor patching methodology remains true.

Namely the fear of missing out some features which require significant internal changes and which if linux is without could lower its attractiveness in some ways.It all depends on Linus T.: arbitration of \"internals breaking changes\". reply userbinator 8 hours agoprev [–] It&#x27;s really disturbing that software is the only thing whose stability seems to be decreasing very significantly over time, and dragging down everything that it&#x27;s embedded in.Who wants constant changes and breakage? Who wants software that&#x27;s in constant need of updating? I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the users. reply jupp0r 7 hours agoparentThe point of LTS kernels is that they do get constant updates ie that security patches are backported. There is no world in which you can avoid updating frequently. reply usr1106 7 hours agorootparentThere are many more updates than security updates coming to LTS kernels all the time.Kernel updates are more often than not even categorized in any way. Only for very prominent vulnerabilities the security impact is clear to a larger audience. reply bman_kg 7 hours agorootparentSo does it mean that linux is rolling out updates but these updates do not consider security? Just curious about this thing, I just started using linux and this topic is interesting for me reply elsjaako 1 hour agorootparentIt means that there are bug fixesall the time, but most of the time no one sorts these into \"security\" and \"non-security\" categories.I remember a message (I can&#x27;t find it back right now) where this is explained. Basically the thinking is that a lot of bugs can be used to break security, but sometimes it takes a lot of effort to figure out how to exploit a bug.So you have some choices:* Research every bug to find out the security implications, which is additional work on top of fixing the bug.* Mark only the bugs that have known security implications as security fixes, basically guaranteeing that you will miss some that you haven&#x27;t researched.* Consider all bugs as potentially having security implications. This is basically what they do now. reply worthless-trash 7 hours agorootparentprevUpstream seems downright hostile to classifying patches as security. reply mr_toad 5 hours agorootparentNearly any bug could be a security risk. reply titzer 8 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s always time to refactor and tinker with incomplete migration, always time to debug and patch and fuss with updates, but never time to sit down, gather all the requirements, redesign, and reimplement. reply arcticbull 8 hours agorootparentUltimately it&#x27;s just a question of objectives. Usually software isn&#x27;t written for its own sake. It&#x27;s written to achieve a goal, meet a customer need, generate revenue, prove a market, etc. You can achieve those goals without gathering all the requirements, redesigning and re-implementing most of the time.

This industry is full of \"feel good\" messaging, but generates 50 million metric tons of e-waste each year. We believe the best way to reduce environmental impact is to create products that last longer, meaning fewer new ones need to be made. Instead of operating on feels, we operate on data and actions. With funding from Intel, we commissioned Fraunhofer IZM to do a detailed life cycle analysis (LCA) on Framework Laptop 13 to help us understand where we are today and where we can continue to improve. Check out our thoughts on reducing environmental impact and download the LCA report here. Production update on Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series) We continue to be on track to start shipments before the end of the month on the new Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series). Last week we shared that SMT (Mainboard production) had started, and this week we’ve begun final assembly of laptops. We also pulled some early units to send out to press reviewers to make sure that you can see exactly where we’ve landed on performance and battery life. We have another happy bit of news to share with you: our Lead System Architect Kieran was able to implement a firmware solution to reduce power consumption when using HDMI and DP Expansion Cards on the back two slots. The only remaining power issue is with USB-A Expansion Cards on the back slots, which we are investigating a future USB-A Expansion Card hardware revision to resolve. Modular gaming handheld by pitstoptech We are constantly amazed by the ways community members re-mix modules from Framework Laptops. The most recent mind-blowing example is a modular gaming handheld by pitstoptech with detachable controllers, using a Framework Laptop 13 Mainboard and Battery. This specific instance incorporates last year’s 12th Gen Intel Core Mainboard, but with this year’s Ryzen 7040 Mainboards, gaming performance should exceed Steam Deck and other similar handhelds. This is a great way to re-use Mainboards, whether you have a leftover one after upgrading your Framework Laptop or you picked up one of the newly discounted ones in the Marketplace.

For instance for most people driving less, or driving smaller vehicles, would be far more effective. reply noobermin 9 hours agorootparentI know anti-car attitudes annoy some people, but we really should drive this home(pun not intended but taken advantage of). People keep using \"a tank of gas\" as a fungible, graspable unit of carbon emissions while not realising reducing that very thing often has an out-sized impact on carbon emission, sometimes more than other things like reusing clothes, internet usage of this or that services or saas, and so on. Transport is by-and-large the #1 source of emissions in the US[0], the majority of which are passenger cars and trucks[1]. Reducing car dependency would be one of the largest contributors to sustainability the US (and many other nations, but likely not as much as America) could do to have an impact on climate change[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;ghgemissions&#x2F;sources-greenhouse-gas-emis...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;ghgemissions&#x2F;sources-greenhouse-gas-emis...Pulled quote from [1]: \"The largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans. These sources account for over half of the emissions from the transportation sector.\" reply marcus_holmes 9 hours agorootparentWhen I&#x27;ve pointed out to people that if they really want to be green then they should stop driving their car, I got a response along the lines of \"the top ten producers of CO2 are all private companies. It&#x27;s not about changing public behaviours, it&#x27;s about regulating corporate behaviours\".I never buy this, because corporate behaviours are driven by the market, which is driven by public behaviours. If we all stopped driving cars, the oil companies are going to stop processing so much oil.But I do understand that changing that much public behaviour is difficult (and made more difficult by this attitude&#x2F;argument). So regulating the oil companies and making fuel so expensive that people can&#x27;t drive their cars appears to be the only way to do this.Except that if fuel prices go up, people point out that they can&#x27;t afford to drive for necessary trips. And the transport infrastructure is all based around lots of private cars. So the government has to keep fuel prices low enough to make cars usable for poor people. Which means no-one gives up their cars and the oil companies carry on processing this much oil.So I don&#x27;t really understand how we&#x27;re going to solve this and not cook ourselves. reply gochi 8 hours agorootparentNobody wants to sacrifice anything, and yet that&#x27;s exactly what is needed from humanity. Can&#x27;t even change the small things, as we see through outrage over plastic straws still, nevermind trying to get people to eat less meat.I will add however that oil companies wouldn&#x27;t stop processing so much oil right away, they will do what desperate powers do which is cling to remaining power as tightly as they can. This isn&#x27;t something worth really caring about in the long run, but something to be cognizant of when trying to shift public behaviour as they will undoubtedly be affected by the propaganda such powers will be obsessively pushing out.See also: tobacco companies spending several decades avoiding regulatory processes in advertising and convincing people they had no idea it was harmful nor that it was their fault for encouraging such consumption. Sounds a little familiar to several other industries. reply ip26 8 hours agorootparentA survey sticks in my mind; it found that people were considerably more willing to pay higher taxes if they trusted everyone else would pay their share too. I think the same lesson can be applied here. Nobody wants to personally make big sacrifices while everyone else is living large, and I can’t blame them.If the producer has to deal with the problem and prices rise, no one can opt out of sharing the burden. reply bigstrat2003 7 hours agorootparentprev> Can&#x27;t even change the small things, as we see through outrage over plastic straws still, nevermind trying to get people to eat less meat.If you want people who aren&#x27;t ideologically on board to sacrifice, you need viable alternatives. Cardboard straws suck ass. Without exception, every single cardboard straw I&#x27;ve ever used was soggy and tasted... well, like cardboard. They simply are not viable replacements. Fake meat is better at least (I&#x27;ve had impossible burger and it&#x27;s legitimately good), but it&#x27;s hella expensive and that&#x27;s going to be a hard sell for people. Moreover, talk about not eating meat is absolutely dominated by people who have a moral objection to eating meat, not people who are concerned about carbon emissions. Which is fine, but the majority of people don&#x27;t agree there is a moral issue (and many even think it&#x27;s crazy to hold that position), so that&#x27;s not going to convince anyone to bear a higher price. Get the price more on par with ground beef, get the public perception to be about the environment and not animal rights, and you could probably see big changes.Conversely, look at LED bulbs versus incandescent. While they cost more up front, LED bulbs last forever and cost so much less in terms of electricity that they are just overwhelmingly better for most uses. I myself don&#x27;t give two shits about the environment, but I don&#x27;t see myself buying anything but LED bulbs ever again. They&#x27;re just that much better. That&#x27;s the kind of innovation one needs to advance if one wants to change the behavior of the masses. Give them something which is not only environmentally better but practically better, and they will adopt it. But you can&#x27;t expect most people to sacrifice for the environment. The reality is that most people just don&#x27;t care, and they aren&#x27;t going to sacrifice for something they don&#x27;t care about. reply grogenaut 3 hours agorootparentI actually had a great (for cardboard) straw from jacksons in portland this weekend. I grabbed 3 of them thinking they&#x27;d melt. It did 2 full ~42oz diet dews over 4 hours before it started melting. the 2nd one lasted longer (I re-used the cup for drinks that night) holding up to 4 32 oz coke zeros and vodka.

I think they need information more than viable alternatives. reply kelnos 4 hours agorootparentPart of the issue with your argument is that most policymakers will be dead by the time society collapses, so they don&#x27;t care as much. Sure, there&#x27;s often rhetoric around \"saving the world for my children and their children\", but in the end most people are selfish and are fine with making things the problems of future generations.\"Information\" doesn&#x27;t sway people. Feelings do. If they feel like they&#x27;re eating&#x2F;using&#x2F;whatever something inferior to what they&#x27;ve grown up using, all in the name of sustainability, they&#x27;re going to balk. reply palata 3 hours agorootparent> Part of the issue with your argument is that most policymakers will be dead by the time society collapsesHmm... given how it is going (climate seems to be changing faster than the models predicted), it&#x27;s getting more and more clear that global instability, wars and famine will be here in the next few decades (if you doubt the \"famine\" issue: take any big US city, and ask yourself what happens if trucks can&#x27;t get into the city and bring food for a few days). Unless most policymakers are 60 or so, they have a good chance to live long enough to see that. Most definitely their children.> \"Information\" doesn&#x27;t sway people. Feelings do.When you realize how bad the biodiversity problem is, how bad climate change is, and how bad the energy problem (which is actually the root cause of the other two) is, I think the only reasonable feeling you can get is fear. Maybe faith in technology helps (many people hide behind \"they will find a solution\"), so maybe one needs to realize that the tech industry is a big money-making joke.But once you get that information, you should get the fear. And fear should make you accept to start thinking about actions to mitigate the consequences of... well of our way of life. reply marcus_holmes 8 hours agorootparentprev\"the best time to regulate oil was 50 years ago.

Or at least maybe. If demand from autos drops so does the price of oil. At some point it becomes feasible to be used for things that were previously too expensive. Like what? I&#x27;m not sure but these things happen. It&#x27;s how the market \"thinks\".Worst case, the cost of plastic falls even further. Less autos equals more plastic?Regulation via higher taxes on petroleum-sourced products could work but it continues to be politically unfeasible. reply kelnos 4 hours agorootparentOPEC (et al.) won&#x27;t let that happen. If demand drops, they&#x27;ll artificially constrain supply in order to prop up the price.Of course, there could end up being a point in time when demand is so low that their whole thing just collapses. reply marcus_holmes 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you on the supply&#x2F;demand thing. Which is unfortunate because we need to stop using so much oil. reply tourmalinetaco 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd what exactly is the solution there? For most Americans a car is literally their ONLY option for transport.> I never buy this, because corporate behaviours are driven by the market, which is driven by public behaviours.I’ve heard this many times, but it’s simply not true. There was no demand for glued-in batteries, lightbulbs that die prematurely, or SaaS. However, when something is required to maintain your job or current state of living, people will accept the corporate greed. No one but Adobe was happier because Photoshop removed ownership, but people need Photoshop for their work and have to live with it. No one wanted lightbulbs that die earlier than before, but that’s all they sell. And don’t even get me started on the righteous anger felt over the fact that Apple made ewaste trendy.Also, you obviously haven’t seen how much CO2 a 10kHP engine puts out after an 8 hour shift.> So regulating the oil companies and making fuel so expensive that people can&#x27;t drive their cars appears to be the only way to do this.I’m glad you are far away from America, because even in Europe this is a hilariously stupid idea. Sure let’s just leave a large chunk of society stranded at home with no ability to have a job, they’ll surely be happy we “saved the planet” by cutting out minor CO2 emissions while corporate greed leads to mass produced garbage.> So I don&#x27;t really understand I’m not surprised, considering your radical views. reply noobermin 4 hours agorootparentThe only two options are not \"you, individual, drive less\" and \"go to wall-street^W^W the office of shell gas and tell them to cut it out.\" A lot of americans are forced into car dependency, but at the very same time, it is very easy to drive in downtowns in the US even where it is difficult to own a car. You need to do both, both disincentivize driving on the personal level and regulate companies and change land-use patterns and street design to facilitate other modes. It&#x27;s a difficult problem to solve but if you think it&#x27;s an actual problem you must solve it for our future climate and the other ills car culture leaves society.As for you continuing to insist that tut-tut-ing corporations is enough, the numbers are clear that just because 1 airplane moving packages produces more carbon per km, it doesn&#x27;t matter as I said above, the majority of transport emissions are passenger cars and trucks, just because they are so many of them. There is room for amelioration for industry transportation numbers but it will not matter if you just touch that and still continue existing usage in the US. Even getting to European levels of car usage would change things significantly for the US. Regardless, know putting an onerous tax on gas producers will immediately see gas prices rise for everyone, so even if it is indirect, you still are disincentivizing driving. There is no way out of this problem without disincentivizing driving.Now, of course, you have to believe this really is a problem. Because only then do you think something as difficult as changing the prioritized mode of a transport for a country is a worthwhile thing to do. reply kelnos 4 hours agorootparentThe problem with making driving more expensive (which is what happens when you try to legally disincentivize it) is that it becomes a regressive tax: lower-income folks get hurt very badly by it. The rich of course don&#x27;t love paying extra for something (and, being the ones usually in power, will fight against it), but can usually bear the cost without much pain. reply Karrot_Kream 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worth remembering that the poorest, those that can&#x27;t afford a car or can only afford 1 car for the family, are reliant on public transit. But yes, making driving expensive often ends up hurting the lower-middle class the most because they usually live in the least walkable areas due to historical redlining and generally commute the furthest. The fact that this is a regressive tax is a big talking point for keeping driving cheap.The problem is, the alternative is to throw money at a public transit system and nobody wants to do that either. You can make the taxes highly progressive, but even then, I doubt anyone would agree. In general the only thing to do is what activist groups are doing already; fight the local institutions (DOTs, planning departments, city council, etc.) to make the changes necessary to make getting around without a car viable, fast, comfortable, and cheap. reply palata 6 hours agorootparentprev> And what exactly is the solution there? For most Americans a car is literally their ONLY option for transport.Hmm without saying that Americans need to do without a car entirely (because the country screwed up in that sense), I am pretty sure that in many situations, it is possible to not use a car.My experience is that Americans tend to not even consider taking a bike for a short ride. I have been in multiple places where I would use the electric scooters or bikes (bikes are better) for relatively short distances (say less than 30min), and I was often not much slower than with a car. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentI think bikes and scooters would be more popular where I am (Seattle) if they weren’t so easy to steal. Even unpowered bikes are disappearing from regular use due to rampant theft. It’s sad. reply jjav 3 hours agorootparent> I think bikes and scooters would be more popular where I am (Seattle) if they weren’t so easy to steal.Yes, this is a big factor. Where I live (around silicon valley area) I can easily bike to nearly everything I need. But! Secure bike parking is rarely available. So my bike is guaranteed to be stolen. So the result is I either walk (if within ~10 minute walk) or drive. I&#x27;m a cyclist so I&#x27;d love to bike everywhere but without secure bike parking, can&#x27;t happen. reply palata 3 hours agorootparentI find it a bit sad that (secure) bike parking is missing in a country where it honestly feels like half of the constructed territory is parking lots.Not a criticism, but the area covered by parking lots in the US shocks me every time I visit.Instead of making half-working heavy autonomous electric cars, couldn&#x27;t Silicon Valley somehow find a low-tech way to solve the secure bike parking issue? They are good at claiming that they want a better world, and this should not be rocket science. reply Karrot_Kream 2 hours agorootparentI mean of course it could. Much like we have parking minimums, we could just mandate bike locker minimums. There&#x27;s already a robust bike locker program in the area called Bikelink so it would just be about expanding the program. The problem is nobody has lobbied the government to do this yet and updating code like this is hard because maintaining the status quo is easy. Developers will also undoubtedly fight it because it raises costs. replygochi 8 hours agorootparentprev>And what exactly is the solution there? For most Americans a car is literally their ONLY option for transport.The administration has already earmarked substantial amounts for various transit programs across the country thankfully. You can find out more https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transit.dot.gov&#x2F;TODThese programs also include zero-emission transit as a primary focus where possible, such as school buses.So the solution already exists and is in action. It just takes time! reply marcus_holmes 8 hours agorootparentprevSo what do you think the answer is? reply kbelder 5 hours agorootparentSlow transition to electric cars coupled with a large investment in nuclear energy. reply tiffanyg 8 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the great thing about &#x27;game theory&#x27;. The rules can so easily be set up to funnel &#x27;players&#x27; inexorably into \"WarGames\"-like resolutions. I.e., no matter how well the game is played, everyone loses (phrased rather more effectively in the movie, though).Realistically, though, the comparatively slow march - in \"WarGames\" terms, but not human lifespan terms - towards the conclusion for our species, clearly won&#x27;t result in equal losing over given near-term timeframes. That is almost certainly one of the calculations* for some players who continue to push destructive patterns.Human activity (think economic) is incredibly interdependent as well as massively interwoven with an incredible array of aspects of our planet. There are always &#x27;externalities&#x27; - i.e., the cost of goods and services probably ALWAYS (even in really &#x27;primitive&#x27; economies) is missing a little bit in the accounting, so-to-speak. For example, when Virginia was fairly well-settled by Europeans, with many of the original inhabitants pushed out, tobacco was king. But growing tobacco is very hard on the land - tobacco is a crop that depletes soil very quickly. The solution, at the time, was to just develop a new plot after several years. Land was absurdly abundant from the perspective of the colonists of the time - and people like Lord Fairfax had tremendous tracts (his represented a substantial part of the current state). All of the decades and centuries that went into producing soil that led to great tobacco production was an externality. The environment, original inhabitants of all types (including ALL organisms), etc. contributed to ... or, perhaps better, SUBSIDIZED the tobacco production for those who moved in. And those who moved in generally never paid any of that back.

The US can stand a lot of changes in public travel, i.e. it’s bullshit that I cannot take the train from one state capital to another, barring Hawaii and possibly Alaska. It’s also bullshit, however, when urbanists&#x2F;“fuck car” people enter the conversation and demand we need to destroy rural and suburban living entirely. Even labeling it as anti-car is, frankly, ignorant of reality. Not even Europe is car-free, and Europe is much more dense than America. Instead of anti-car, the topic should always be pro-choice in transport, which is the real problem in the US.I also, in general, find CO2 to be a weak argument for climate change that is normally brought up as a smoke screen for big businesses like Google or Apple, who make literal tons of unrepairable ewaste, to make them appear better than they are.

I realized these things depend on Apple supporting the A13 chip in order for it to remain compatible with new technologies and, absurdly, to remain secure from exploits. A monitor.I couldn’t regret my purchase much more and feel pretty stupid for not figuring this stuff out before I pulled out my credit card.To add insult to injury, the display has been getting repaired for almost 2 months and there’s still no ETA on a fix. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a display, both for ecological reasons but also because these things likely have a software-driven expiry date, with their hardware being relatively complex and error prone compared to most displays.Also, they come with a barely usable camera. Audio is fine but it’s mind boggling how bad the camera is.

Certainly you won&#x27;t get full price for it, but especially if Apple gives up and sends you a new-in-box replacement, you might be able to get pretty close.Then you can buy something better.

Thanks for the suggestion. reply kelnos 4 hours agorootparentI would probably recommend the small-claims court first (assuming that&#x27;s a thing where you live). If you issue a chargeback, Apple isn&#x27;t constrained by any code of conduct, and could retaliate by deactivating your Apple ID or refusing to sell you anything in the future, or...But if you get a court order for Apple to take some specific action (like a refund), I&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be less likely to retaliate since you could presumably bring another (legal) case against them that their retaliation was shady.Then again, I don&#x27;t know about laws where you live, so maybe this isn&#x27;t a consideration. replynrp 4 hours agoparentprevThe report calls this out, but some of the numbers like material utilization come from direct measurements, while others are extrapolations from other LCA models.

Solar and wind with battery storage, and fission to fill in the rest. Nuclear being politically unfeasible doesn&#x27;t change the reality that it&#x27;s pretty damn clean. Waste disposal&#x2F;storage is a solved problem except for -- of course, again -- the politics.Yes, you can argue that \"the politics\" is important, and that makes it not \"solved\", and I&#x27;d agree. But we do have a low-emission energy source, and it&#x27;s not a miracle, it&#x27;s just science from the middle of the last century. reply palata 3 hours agorootparentI kindly disagree. Solar and wind are marginal, and they have developed a lot thanks to fossil fuels. For society to not collapse, we would need them to scale in a world without fossil fuels. That is very far from being remotely proven. Then you can&#x27;t control solar and wind (if there is no sun and no wind, you&#x27;re screwed), so you need something else. If you have that something else, then probably you don&#x27;t need that much solar&#x2F;wind. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: some solar and some wind is probably appropriate in many situations, but that is far from remotely replacing fossil fuels.Fission is nice, but it takes a lot of time to build new plants (we as a society will be screwed pretty soon, so we don&#x27;t have a ton of time before deciding to build new ones), but still they won&#x27;t replace fossil fuels entirely.Which means that we are going towards a future with less energy. If we screw up (and keep not doing anything like now), we&#x27;re essentially dead. If we do it really well, we will have some energy, but not as much as today.Therefore we need to prepare our society to deal with less energy. That has nothing to do with politics, it&#x27;s just physics. Politics will make the difference between society completely collapsing and society dealing with less energy. reply sharkjacobs 10 hours agoparentprev> and if you consider that even half of those are served by itAre they? reply ewzimm 8 hours agorootparentPhilosophically, it’s up for debate, but whether they’re served well isn’t as important as if they’re using the products at all.

It would have been nice if components were modular.Imagine if the 4g&#x2F;5g, bluetooth and wifi modules if the billions of phones out there could be reused. Even CPU and memory might be reused on servers.From a security perspective as well, the whole VM thing isn&#x27;t working out. If server racks had like 100 cpus each with dedicated 4GB ram all in 2U, you can pin a process per cpu&#x2F;related ram, but the best part is if the components are reused from consumer devices, they might be dirt cheap, and you can build a much more reliable setup where cpu&#x2F;ram failing just means reduced capacity until you hotplug more. reply duskwuff 4 hours agoparent> the best part is if the components are reused from consumer devices, they might be dirt cheapOlder hardware takes substantially more power to do the same work (and more power at idle); in a datacenter environment, this also means more power consumption for cooling.
