    "originBody": "Moving our Encrypted DNS servers to run in RAM November 10, 2023 System Transparency We recently announced the completion of our migration to remove all traces of disks in use on our VPN infrastructure. Today we can announce more steps forward - our Encrypted DNS service has also been converted to run from RAM! Encrypted DNS for all - paying customers or not Encrypted DNS (also known as DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS) protects your DNS queries from being snooped on by third parties when not connected to our VPN service. DNS queries are encrypted between your device and our DNS servers. Primarily as a service to be used when not connected to our VPN servers, this service is completely cost-free, and available to anyone that wishes to have a trustworthy, audited Encrypted DNS service with optional content blocking. This service is available from servers located worldwide, and can be configured by using the following guide on our website. This service can be used in conjunction with our VPN service, but is discouraged, as it will always be slower than using the DNS resolver on the VPN server that you are connected to. All of these Encrypted DNS servers are configured using the same Linux kernel, with the same level of security and privacy as the as our VPN infrastructure. This is the next step towards running our stateless infrastructure from RAM.",

This is a limitation of macOS that Apple hasn&#x27;t bothered to fix. reply WirelessGigabit 16 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t work how? Little Snitch &#x2F; Lulu don&#x27;t use the profile? As in DNS traffic is not encrypted?Little Snitch &#x2F; Lulu die?Do you have like a ticket for more explanation? reply Etheryte 15 hours agorootparentYou can have one or the other active at a time, but not both simultaneously. If you have the DNS profile turned on and then proceed to turn on Little Snitch&#x2F;Lulu, the DNS profile will get turned off by macOS and whatever other DNS configuration you have will take precedence. It&#x27;s mentioned in passing by Mullvad in the docs [0]:> If you have more than one profile added then macOS seems to use only the last one that you installed. If you remove a profile then it appears that it will not use any of the other profiles.This isn&#x27;t unique to Little Snitch&#x2F;Lulu and Mullvad though, you would run into the same problem with any application that creates a network filter by using a profile, see [1] for example. Since the full blown Mullvad VPN app does not use system profiles, it does work in tandem with Little Snitch&#x2F;Lulu.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;help&#x2F;dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls#...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.codeproxy.net&#x2F;paulmillr&#x2F;encrypted-dns&#x2F;issues&#x2F;13 reply Erratic6576 4 hours agorootparentprevI guess the solution is to use unbound reply SV_BubbleTime 15 hours agoparentprevCan you help me out with the threat model for encrypted DNS?As I see it, the model is that I need to contact a site, and use DNS to get the IP - but either my ISP or my VPN provider can see I’m visiting that IP whether I looked it up just now, or knew it already.So unless the model is I’m using a VPN, but am leaking via someone else’s logging DNS, I don’t really get it. reply Etheryte 15 hours agorootparentPersonally my main motivation is I don&#x27;t want anyone to snoop what sites I visit and then sell that data, my ISP included, but there are other issues too. To quote Cloudflare [0]:> Queries could be directed to a resolver that performs DNS hijacking. For example, in the UK, Virgin Media and BT return a fake response for domains that do not exist, redirecting users to a search page. This redirection is possible because the computer&#x2F;phone blindly trusts the DNS resolver that was advertised using DHCP by the ISP-provided gateway router.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;dns-encryption-explained&#x2F; reply _Algernon_ 15 hours agorootparentCant your ISP reverse lookup the IPs you connect to based on your IP headers anyways? reply fullspectrumdev 12 hours agorootparentRather amusingly, the massive centralisation of the internet, which is bad for privacy in every other way, actually protects you here. reply eddd-ddde 11 hours agorootparentYep, cloudflare dns proxy essentially hides your origin ip addresses. reply jrockway 14 hours agorootparentprevThey can, but pretty much everything will reverse lookup to Cloudflare or AWS. reply gruez 9 hours agorootparentSNI reveals the exact site though reply mmwelt 5 hours agorootparentAs I understand it, this is now being addressed by ESNI[1] and ECH[2].

In that case afaik only the DNS server and the remote host you’re connecting to would know what FQDN you&#x27;re connecting to—anyone else would only see the IP of the remote host. If the host serves requests for lots of different FQDNs, that’s less information going around. reply Erratic6576 4 hours agorootparentprevYour connection is encrypted through https. Your DNS lookups aren’t yet though. Your ISP or network manager could have access to that data.A vpn reduces speed and battery life reply LinuxBender 18 hours agoprevAre these physical servers or VM&#x27;s? I ask because some VM types can be frozen&#x2F;shapshot&#x2F;cloned or live replicated including memory contents as is done in some VPS providers for lawful requests. From the bare metal host anything can be accessed in a VM or container. Do they have a diagram of their physical setup?[Edit] - Are there any Mullvad architects here that can help us avoid going down theoretical hypothetical rabbit holes and turtle stacks? reply dijit 18 hours agoparentMullvad has been pushing system transparency a lot (which is a security system specifically designed for bare-metal), so it&#x27;s fairly safe to say that it&#x27;s based on bare-metal.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.system-transparency.org reply LinuxBender 18 hours agorootparentMaybe it should be safe to say? but do they actually have a diagram of their physical and logical setup that shows they use bare metal only and not VM&#x27;s or containers? Is that documented in audited security controls? reply dijit 18 hours agorootparentSuch a weird discussion because we&#x27;re talking about a company that is going from the very fundamentals of operating system design and the boot process of bare metal machines in order to get more security.It&#x27;s very antithetical to that goal to add more layers of abstraction that could be buggy or reduce security. We&#x27;re talking about motivated and intelligent people purposefully trading off convenience for security.Containers, btw, cannot be snapshotted. So that&#x27;s a weird thing to put into your question.They&#x27;ve also discussed booting UEFI directly to VPN nodes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;1&#x2F;12&#x2F;diskless-infrastructur...It&#x27;s completely weird to argue that they might introduce a layer of insecurity here.

They and I know they can&#x27;t side step lawful requests which raises the spidey senses even further so I believe it is a valid question.Containers, btw, cannot be snapshotted.I did not say they could be. Their memory contents however can be accessed, even if the host memory is encrypted.They&#x27;ve also discussed booting UEFI directly to VPN nodes:That in no way precludes having VM&#x27;s. I have run VM&#x27;s on PXE Diskless nodes. The boot method is orthogonal to this.It&#x27;s completely weird to argue that they might introduce a layer of insecurity here.Weird maybe? But completely logical and valid question nonetheless. They are leaving 53 characters out of their documentation unless I missed it. My questions could be solved by saying \"We do not any form of virtual machines or containers\". That is only 53 characters and should fit on their document site. reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparent>They and I know they can&#x27;t side step lawful requests which raises the spidey senses even further so I believe it is a valid question.They have been able to turn down lawful requests previously, which is (at the very least) a positive indicator that may lower your spidey senses a bit.>On April 18 at least six police officers from the National Operations Department (NOA) of the Swedish Police visited the Mullvad VPN office in Gothenburg with a search warrant.>After demonstrating that this is indeed how our service works and them consulting the prosecutor they left without taking anything and without any customer information.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;4&#x2F;20&#x2F;mullvad-vpn-was-subjec... reply LinuxBender 16 hours agorootparentI remember that and that case was cool. I will leave my questions in place though because I recall Apple doing the same thing when a terrorist phone was locked and they claimed to not be able to access with a big public show&#x2F;fight it but turns out they could and so could the FBI. My theory is that they did not want the public to lose confidence in their phones. reply theshrike79 11 hours agorootparentApple would&#x27;ve had to create a specific OS update with a security hole the FBI could&#x27;ve exploited and distributed that.Courts couldn&#x27;t force them to do that -> FBI went another way. This was in the iPhone 7 era IIRC.Currently their stuff is locked down even tighter and Apple has even less ability to hack anyone&#x27;s phone. Barring a full-on backdoored software update targeted to a specific person - which they refused to do once already. reply hathawsh 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that Apple case was really interesting. I always guessed that Apple could simply push a software update (possibly to everyone) that happens to open a backdoor for a specific phone. I wonder if that&#x27;s what they did. reply asynchronous 13 hours agorootparentWhat happened in that case is the FBI went to a different vendor, and they broke into the iPhone either with a zero day they had developed or more likely, they just cloned the phone hardware thousands of times until they could guess the password. reply buildbot 13 hours agorootparentYep, Apple had nothing to do with it. They do hand over iCloud data (which now can be E2E) reply buildbot 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe - depends on how secure enclave is built. It may have hardware defined limitations on # of tries for the passkey and no way to circumvent that in firmware even. reply 10000truths 12 hours agorootparentprev> I am extra skeptical of a company that pushes this. They and I know they can&#x27;t side step lawful requests which raises the spidey senses even further so I believe it is a valid question.\"Here is a subpoena compelling you to disclose the data you have on XYZ.\"\"Sure. Here is the data we have on XYZ.\" hands over blank pageIt&#x27;s not sidestepping the request. They literally do not have the data, because they don&#x27;t retain it. And unless there is a specific law mandating that they retain the data, law enforcement have no grounds for punitive action. reply Ms-J 8 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s a very rational question to ask. Is Mullvad using only bare-metal infrastructure, or is there any logical abstractions added to the servers?Companies make statements all the time which can be twisted to their benefit, but read exactly like what a customer is after. I&#x27;m not stating Mullvad does or doesn&#x27;t do this, btw. reply kaszanka 18 hours agorootparentprev> Containers, btw, cannot be snapshottedWhy not? reply anonacct37 12 hours agorootparentcriu has been used for live migration for a while.Getting a consistent snapshot that you can restore reliably is a hard problem but probably not as big deal for forensic analysis. reply tiagod 1 hour agorootparentprevEven if they did... if mullvad was a honeypot, there is nothing that would stop them from posting a fake diagram. reply k8sToGo 18 hours agoparentprevPhysical server can also be frozen (literally) and then data extracted from RAM. reply LinuxBender 18 hours agorootparentIt can but to my knowledge law enforcement in the US anyway have only done this once for a national security incident in the real world outside of a lab. If you have any links to this becoming common practice outside of a lab demo or security presentation on their own hardware I would be interested to save in my own documentation.They can also buy cases that have anti-tampering controls that force a poweroff if the case is opened but that is getting into more costly edge cases. The hardware exists but is not datacenter operations friendly. It is also possible to force a wipe of ram on a clean shutdown but one must assume this won&#x27;t be. As one example the feds took Mega&#x27;s servers from Equinix after yanking out the cables and out the door they went.[Edit] I should add for completeness sake there are kernel boot options to clear memory space before allocation and after de-allocation with a performance hit. Both are enabled by default on modern kernels now. init_on_alloc=1 init_on_free=1 reply mschuster91 17 hours agorootparentThere exist special UPSes that you can attach to a power line of a server, unplug and unmount it, and keep the server powered all the time, without the server being able to detect that.If you are really serious about security, you need to have a watchdog on network link downtimes because, no matter what, you can&#x27;t disrupt a fiber optic network link without the server noticing. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 14 hours agorootparentJust like Seinfeld and saving the Frogger high score. reply tln 17 hours agorootparentprevWhoa!

It’s made to raise alerts about a power rail failing. So this makes it harder because you need to keep power on both to not raise any alarm replyadrian_b 18 hours agorootparentprevThat is why modern servers have the option to encrypt the DRAM to prevent this attack.Moreover, there is also the option to have distinct randomly-generated keys for each virtual machine, to make useless the speculative attacks that succeed to peek at the memory of another VM.AMD has offered these options for years and the future Intel CPUs will also have them. reply greentea23 18 hours agorootparentprevAre there any known examples of this actually being done by law enforcement or government and working? reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of examples of it working (e.g. researchers from F-Secure presented at SEC-T conference in 2018 with a cold-boot against Bitlocker), but I haven&#x27;t seen a LEA or government come out and say \"we got access to X via a cold-boot attack\". reply roenxi 9 hours agorootparentAlthough, obviously, it was the same story with dragnet spying before Snowden. Sure it was technically possible in a lab environment and law enforcement had incentive to do it, but nobody could turn up any actual evidence. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 14 hours agorootparentprevAs RAM densities&#x2F;speed increase, I wonder if this is still viable. DDR5 had to mandate some baseline ECC given the intrinsic error rate. reply xyst 14 hours agorootparentprevgood ole can of air compressor flipped upside down and quick hands trick reply LinuxBender 12 hours agoparentprevThe more I think about this VM&#x27;s are not required. There are tools that can extract data streams based on specific parameters on demand using eBPF. Perhaps tools like Sysdig&#x2F;Falco, etc... It might also be useful to know if they custom compile kernels to disable eBPF and if they do any additional specific kernel hardening to strip out or disable on demand debugging capabilities. reply WirelessGigabit 16 hours agoparentprevOne can fix that by deploying software with the VM pause functionality removed and &#x2F; or remove disks the bare-metal servers and only PXE-boot them. That way there is nothing to pause. reply xyst 14 hours agoparentprevIf you are asking this, you probably need to self host your VPN reply LinuxBender 14 hours agorootparentI do this but I do not use them for privacy. I use Tinc [1] to route around internet outages as it can do user-space dynamic mesh routing. Since they are all nodes I pay for they would not hide who I am. While I do control the logging of Tinc I do not control external logging of the server and VPS providers.For privacy I might theoretically use Tor but most sites block or grief people on that network. Tor exit nodes share some risks that of public WiFi.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinc-vpn.org&#x2F; reply throwaway914 18 hours agoprevAs a naive outsider: Does RAM in 2023 encrypt all its contents?Can we reliably \"forget\" the contents of what&#x27;s in RAM by powering-off and letting some encryption key somewhere fade from a smaller, more volatile piece of memory? I&#x27;m curious what has been done to mitigate cold-boot attacks in RAM. What has changed in hardware? Are the keys to encrypt contents of RAM kept in the TPM or something? reply jchw 18 hours agoparentIn this case I think the point of running from RAM is that there isn&#x27;t non-volatile storage. Of course, someone who has physically compromised the server could do potentially bad things, but this makes it harder to e.g. persistently compromise a server, since it doesn&#x27;t have storage to store malware on persistently, or e.g. accidentally or intentionally log data, since there is no local storage to log it on.Encrypting what&#x27;s in RAM would possibly add some additional protection but realistically if things are done right what&#x27;s left in RAM will probably be only marginally more interesting than what you can see over the wire; at most I&#x27;d expect you could see a tiny amount of active request data. That&#x27;s just a guess, though. reply ignoramous 17 hours agorootparent> since it doesn&#x27;t have storage to store malware on persistently, or e.g. accidentally or intentionally log data, since there is no local storage to log it on.Does this prevent rootkits?> but realistically if things are done right what&#x27;s left in RAM will probably be only marginally more interestingSee: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cold_boot_attack reply jchw 17 hours agorootparent> Does this prevet rootkits?That&#x27;s the idea. If the OS is immutable, where do you put them?Bootkits require further mitigation to prevent, but Mullvad has also put effort into that, too, with their secure coreboot bootchain.Of course as an end-user you still can&#x27;t really fully validate a machine over the network has not been tampered with, so you&#x27;re obviously ultimately still trusting Mullvad as you&#x27;d expect.> See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cold_boot_attackYes, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m referring to. I don&#x27;t expect that there would be a significant amount of requests in RAM, probably just remnants of mainly what was active (and some de-allocated but not cleared remnants?) when the machine was reset. reply LinuxBender 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the idea. If the OS is immutable, where do you put them?They would be in the PXE image. There was one time I flubbed on this actually. I had to change export options on our PXE servers to fix something and I forgot to change it back adding my poor excuse of multitasking and being lazy. This was in a Dev environment we also used PXE in production believe it or not. A developer sitting across from me said he changed something in the image by mistake and I said, \"That&#x27;s not possi... oh crap.\" It was cool of them to call it out right away. Attackers probably won&#x27;t be so kind. reply jchw 16 hours agorootparentFor what it&#x27;s worth though, that&#x27;s possible to mitigate. I don&#x27;t believe Mullvad uses PXE and they do have a \"secure boot\" validation chain, starting from Coreboot on the hardware.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;1&#x2F;12&#x2F;diskless-infrastructur... reply ignoramous 16 hours agorootparentIt is an improvement, for sure.secure boot, as painful it is to get right, doesn&#x27;t help when the vendor runs its own things with elevated privileges, like they are known to do: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34085635Doubly so, when the said things are not only closed source but vulnerable themselves: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;6ClWmDoes coreboot help in mitigating vuln in privilged vendor blobs? reply jchw 15 hours agorootparentWell, with Coreboot, you at least know the very first instructions executed by the x86 cores are under your control. That&#x27;s all it can really do. Whatever else lurks beneath is really impossible for anyone to scrutinize without insane capital or insider knowledge.Mitigating the risk of Intel ME is obviously something that is complicated. The \"state of the art\" so-to-speak is really just rendering it non-functional. This isn&#x27;t strictly related to Coreboot; that said, Coreboot has a page about ME:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coreboot.org&#x2F;Intel_Management_EngineAnd in general, when you&#x27;re running Coreboot, you&#x27;re running significantly less privileged blackbox blobs (possibly none in some rare cases), and in general, the surface area of Coreboot is going to be dramatically tinier than any typical UEFI system firmware. So it&#x27;s absolutely worth it in that regard.There&#x27;s never going to be a \"perfect\" option here with how complex things have gotten, but I think that you can at least say that Mullvad has taken almost any reasonable step, and perhaps a few steps that are beyond what many would consider reasonable, towards developing effective mitigation of the risks of rootkits, bootkits and malicious&#x2F;unwanted vendor code running on their \"diskless\" architecture.Of course, you still have to trust Mullvad. Trust is definitely a meaty human-y experience, and the cold rational part of our brain craves some kind of technically-bulletproof way to prove that it&#x27;s truly safe, secure, and private, but that&#x27;s just not possible. Best you can do is layer enough assurances on top of each-other in a way that at least some layers are completely independent of others for maintaining your operational security. Far easier said than done, and obviously how rigorously one approaches this will vary on paranoia.At some point you have to pick your middle-ground I suppose. reply generalizations 12 hours agorootparentprev> we also used PXE in production believe it or notWait why would this be a bad thing? reply LinuxBender 12 hours agorootparentIt depends on your use case, SLA&#x27;s and configuration management role&#x2F;structure discipline. There are different schools of thought on diskless boot which is not truly diskless as the images have to be shared from somewhere meaning that disk availability goes from 1:1 to many to one increasing the blast radius of outages when the NAS fails or network re-convergence occurs. They all fail regardless of how many millions one spends and in my experience the more millions the more glorious the failure that should never happen. For some companies this is fine if they have the discipline to balance their servers across many NAS servers in a strict hierarchy that facilitates a smaller predictable POD structure blast radius. But that&#x27;s a bigger topic than I could possibly cover in a HN comment. It also depends on how the OS is being used and how writable spaces tmpfs vs disk are being used. This will all vary wildly across different business models. replytredre3 16 hours agoparentprevAMD offers RAM encryption on their threadripper server CPUs and also in their Ryzen PRO on workstation&#x2F;laptops (you have to enable it in the bios).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;amd-memory-guard-...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;amd&#x2F;en&#x2F;documents&#x2F;epyc-busine... reply latchkey 16 hours agorootparentYears ago, I went to AMD and saw this demonstrated live by engineers there.

    "originBody": "Hiring discrimination — Apple discriminated against US citizens in hiring, DOJ says Apple deterred US citizens from positions open to foreign workers, DOJ found. Jon Brodkin - 11/10/2023, 7:43 PM Enlarge / Apple Store at Garden State Plaza mall on November 4, 2023, in Paramus, New Jersey. Getty ImagesGary Hershorn reader comments 126 with Apple illegally discriminated against US citizens and other US residents in its hiring and recruitment practices for certain types of positions that went to foreign workers, the US Department of Justice said yesterday. Apple agreed to pay up to $25 million in back pay and civil penalties to settle the DOJ allegations. Apple discriminated \"against US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire,\" the agency said. The $25 million payment was called the largest ever collected by the Justice Department under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Apple is required to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and create an $18.25 million fund to provide back pay to those harmed by its hiring practices. Apple did not admit guilt in the settlement. But the company acknowledged in a statement that it had \"unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard,\" according to Reuters. \"We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US,\" Apple said. We contacted Apple and will update this article if it provides any further statement. As Reuters noted, \"Foreign labor can often be cheaper than hiring US workers, and immigrants who rely on their employers for green card sponsorship are seen as less likely to leave for a different job.\" Advertisement DOJ investigation The DOJ said it began investigating in February 2019 and determined \"that Apple violated the INA's anti-discrimination requirements during Apple's recruitment for positions falling under the permanent labor certification program (PERM).\" The agency said the discrimination began no later than January 1, 2018, and continued until at least December 31, 2019. Under this program, a \"permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States,\" the DOL says. But the employer must also obtain a certification \"that there are not sufficient US workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers.\" The DOJ said its investigation \"found that Apple engaged in a pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination in recruitment for positions it hired through PERM, and that the company's unlawful discrimination prejudiced US citizens, US nationals, lawful permanent residents, and those granted asylum or refugee status. These less effective recruitment practices deterred protected workers from applying to positions that Apple preferred to fill instead with PERM beneficiaries.\" Apple did not advertise PERM positions on its external job website like it does with other positions, the DOJ said. \"It also required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications, even though the company permitted electronic applications for other positions,\" the DOJ said. In some cases, \"Apple did not consider certain applications for PERM positions from Apple employees if those applications were submitted electronically, as opposed to paper applications submitted through the mail,\" the agency said. \"These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire.\" Apple changes hiring practices The settlement requires Apple to make its PERM recruitment practices match its standard recruitment practices more closely. Apple will have to \"conduct more expansive recruitment for all PERM positions, including posting PERM positions on its external job website, accepting electronic applications, and enabling applicants to PERM positions to be searchable in its applicant tracking system.\" Apple has already implemented some of the changes and agreed to \"train its employees on the INA's anti-discrimination requirements and be subject to departmental monitoring for the three-year period of the agreement,\" the DOJ said. reader comments 126 with Jon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a wide array of telecom and tech policy topics.

PERM certification is not the same labor certification done in H1B.PERM is a much more rigorous and demanding process and it costs a lot more money than anything related to H1B. The reason is because it leads to a green card, not just a work permit. Often, it requires an advance degree and higher qualification than H1B too, PhDs or experienced masters. The money is paid upfront and USCIS then look into it and approves PERM on a case by case basis often taking a year or more. Then when the PERM passes, the applicant can finally get on the green card backlog and wait a few more years, or a decade if you were born in the wrong place...This is to say the quality of applicants here is very high and Apple actually felt it was worth it to invest tens of thousands of dollars on each of them just for a green card gamble, which the employee can get then quit Apple immediately after and nothing can be done to them because they are now a permanent resident. No such thing as wage depression or abuse at this point because they are for all legal purposes, an equal to any American once they have EB2. reply pavlov 11 hours agoparentThis.If the PERM process at Apple is anything like what I saw at Facebook a couple of years ago, then all these “applicants” are actually people already working at the company on non-immigrant visas whom the company wants to retain.There is no reason to assume that they’re being paid any less than others at Apple. They’re already in the country and have been doing the work for years. Why not give them a path to a green card? Why make the company jump through hoops like having to advertise a position that’s not actually open?I’ll admit that I’m biased because I was in this process at one point. But the notion that I was taking the job of a native-born American was ridiculous because I had been doing the job in London before. So if anything, I brought a UK job to USA. And to turn that into a green card, the company would have to advertise the job on their website. It makes no sense. reply microtherion 10 hours agorootparent> If the PERM process at Apple is anything like what I saw at Facebook a couple of years ago, then all these “applicants” are actually people already working at the company on non-immigrant visas whom the company wants to retain.Indeed. I really doubt Apple prefers foreigners in their hiring (it&#x27;s a rather significant hassle to bring somebody in). If anything, citizens have some edge.But once an immigrant has been hired, the PERM process essentially would require trying to hire for that position again, and employers (not just Apple) are anything but motivated to replace an experienced and qualified employee with several years&#x27; experience at the company with an untested new hire, so they treat this process as a Kabuki performance. reply iaseiadit 6 hours agorootparentI highly doubt it’s a top-down decision to prefer foreign applicants at Apple.

The subterfuge would be completely unnecessary if they applied under the correct visa class and skills of those involved are as advertised. reply bubblethink 7 hours agorootparentThere is no such thing as correct class. Broadly speaking, there are temporary workers who can eventually become permanent residents. And almost everyone needs to go through the same process which involves this PERM business. And everyone needs to participate in this charade of hiring someone once, then pretending that they don&#x27;t have the employee, and then emerging victorious by putting out an ad that only that person satisfies. The competition and interviews already happened when the person was first hired. reply sangnoir 7 hours agorootparent> Broadly speaking, there are temporary workers who can eventually become permanent residents.The laws governing immigration are very specific about the distinctions between visa classes and the requirements for each class- and the devil is in the details.> The competition and interviews already happened when the person was first hired.Perhaps, but that is your and Apple&#x27;s (tacit) opinions. The government of the United States disagrees, and Apple just paid $25 million dollars to avoid getting this issue in front of a judge.The difference in perspective, AFAICT, is you think a GC is a reward for getting a job after besting others (including citizens) in interviews. The government&#x27;s contention is that the bar is higher: PERM is for jobs no American citizen or permanent resident are able and willing to do[1]. There are separate visa classes for being merely good, and being irreplaceable. Pretending that a candidate who is in the former group belongs to the latter by posting jobs on a noticeboard in an unlit basement without stairs is dishonest.1. \"The DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment\" reply tomohelix 6 hours agorootparentThis horse and pony show is a farce, most of us agree. But the fact is, if you don&#x27;t dangle this GC reward, much fewer people would come to the US for work and study. The \"irreplaceable\" term is vague enough that if you strictly enforce it, it would effectively shut down this class of visa. Ask yourself this: how many people in your department would be 100% sure to keep their position if their job is offered up to the public again?Some would welcome the reduced influx of immigrants. But in the long term, it would cripple the US. If an individual can convince a company to sponsor them, they are already highly qualified and productive to society. If you deny even these people from immigrating here, then who would you let in? You turn them away and China or the EU would gladly take them. Meanwhile, you lose a significant portion of your workforce that contribute tax without ever withdrawing from it and a lot of research and development at the PhD and master levels done at minimum wages.The current situation benefits the US a lot. There is a reason why they are hesitating to make any big reform. The US is having the chance to exploit the world&#x27;s best and brightest all for a few pieces of paper a year. At most there are 140K permanent residents being made each year via this route. It is insignificant compared to the millions of US college graduate annually. The argument about \"they took our jobs\" is not really valid to me. reply maeil 34 minutes agorootparent> You turn them away and China or the EU would gladly take them.Firstly, there&#x27;s a good reason the people in question want to go the US instead of China or the EU. EU salaries are much lower and the local language is always a barrier. The same holds for China, salaries can be higher but not US level and then there&#x27;s all the other obvious drawbacks of living there.Secondly, China also wouldn&#x27;t gladly take them, it&#x27;s the direct opposite> if you don&#x27;t dangle this GC rewardIn China a GC-like reward is unfathomable. reply jltsiren 5 hours agorootparentprevThere is no green card category for being irreplaceable. PERM is for situations where it&#x27;s difficult to find equally good US workers, with \"equally good\" left intentionally vague. The idea is that the employer is expected to argue convincingly that the foreign applicant is clearly the best person for the job. That&#x27;s inherently subjective, but most things in immigration and the job market are.Sometimes there is a shortage of domestic candidates with sufficient qualifications and experience in the general field. Sometimes the job is highly specialized, and nobody outside of a handful of internal candidates can possibly do it without extensive training. Sometimes the candidate was selected according to the established standards of a profession, and the job only exists for that particular person. And so on.A fake application process is dishonest, regardless of whether it looks like a real job opportunity or is intentionally kept hidden. But if the process is open and you know in advance that no other candidate can possibly qualify, you are being not only dishonest but also impolite. Unrelated people may apply thinking it&#x27;s a real job opportunity, wasting their time. reply bubblethink 6 hours agorootparentprev>>The difference in opinion, AFAICT, is you think a GC is a reward for getting a job after besting others (including citizens) in interviews.No, the difference in opinion is the absurdity of it all. To the extent that the government (DOL) can influence the labor market, for any practical benefit, it needs to do so at the outset and quickly. The market is already altered here with a large immigrant workforce where there are no restrictions on being a temporary worker - even for years or decades. They just have fewer rights. And it doesn&#x27;t even work as intended. Let&#x27;s say that Apple wants to hire a permanent employee directly. The PERM process takes a year.

It&#x27;s hard to explain why though.I work for a fully remote company. Most of us are based in the US but the company also hires people from some other countries through some kind of agency. Even though many, probably a majority of the US-based people are immigrants (myself included), and many don&#x27;t speak English any better than the agency people, there&#x27;s still somehow a clear divide. The agency people are great - talented, skilled, no issues. But somehow they understand the business less. Their contributions are purely technical. It&#x27;s clear that the company could not just can us all and hire the same number of agency guys, but it&#x27;s hard to explain why.My previous employer once tried to outsource some stuff to India and sent a guy over there to oversee it. It didn&#x27;t go well. But we had lots of Indian people before and since in the company, and they were great. They had the same background, same education. But they were local to the company.I often think of the first iPhone as an extreme example of what I&#x27;m trying to say. It was built in China using parts sourced from China. But it was invented in California, and it had to be. From the inventors and the builders there&#x27;s a sort of spectrum, a range of people, like the developers who conceived and wrote the first killer apps - and the closer you are to the inventing side of things, the closer you need to be to the heart of the company.If I had to put sum it up in a word, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s \"ambiguity\". Knowing what to do when you don&#x27;t have exact instructions requires you to be steeped in the same culture as the CEO and the main market. This isn&#x27;t a fixed thing: I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a market for luxury devices in China now that Americans find it hard to understand. But in general the countries that are the most developed have already experienced what other countries are going through, and thus they are uniquely positioned to dictate what the next big thing is.So companies will always have to do some hiring locally, and the harder the job, the more important it is to be local. reply astrange 4 minutes agorootparent> It&#x27;s a good question.

They advertised for positions in newspapers and only accepted paper applications for PERM positions, unlike their other jobs which are advertised online. This is mainly because you don&#x27;t want anyone actually applying for the PERM roles, since you need to prove no minimally (not most) qualified US citizen or PR could be found.I think long term this is going to make getting PERM approved more difficult. It already takes 2-3 years now (without any audits) to get an I-140 (green card) application approved, not to mention getting the card can take decades in some cases.People on H1B work visa can&#x27;t stay on it for more than 6 years unless they actually get through PERM and get I-140, so I&#x27;m expecting this change will have a chilling effect on employers sponsoring work visas and applying for PERM unless it&#x27;s a very specialized role.

The goal is on-time delivery and passable correctness at minimum cost. That might be fulfilled through in-house IT employees, a COTS product, an onshore or offshore consultancy, or some hybrid. In some cases there is no substitute for expensive in-house onshore talent, but the business is always incentivized to seek one.FAANG engineering shops are not like this at all. Tech teams on their own initiative or with very general charters conceive, create, and release products. If product “requirements” are even written down, there’s a good chance the lead engineers on the project are coauthors. Engineers beyond the entry level are expected to be curious, creative, self-directed… basically bounce around a general problem space creating value wherever and however they can, as long as stakeholders sign off prior to any disruptive changes and there’s a measurable impact to cite for year-end perf.The value created can be mind-boggling - and so can the compensation packages, at no real loss to management. Any team’s backlog of opportunities is deep, and all of them are much more valuable than any amount of wages that could conceivably be spent chasing them. You don’t just want the job done to spec at minimum cost - you want the most capable and innovative people you can get to be at the whiteboard thinking of jobs it would be interesting to do, because the carrying cost if they’re just okay is insignificant, and the upside if they pull something really brilliant is unlimited. replyraincom 11 hours agoparentprevWell, if X is working for a manager M for 3 years at Apple(for that matter, any company), M wants to make sure that wheoever applies to X&#x27;s role during the PERM process (labor certification to ensure that no US citizens&#x2F;perm residents are available to fill X&#x27;s role) gets dinged 100%, no exceptions whatsoever.

Other comments have argued PERM applicants are high-quality. That&#x27;s often not the case. Let me explain the process for non-Americans on how you go through employment-based immigration to the US.You get a work visa. There are typically 4 options. There are 4 major options (there are others that are less common):1. H1B: requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent experience. There is an annual quota. There are now more applicants than visas so there is a lottery. If you don&#x27;t get picked, try again next year. H1B is issued for 3 years and can be renewed for another 3. Beyond that, you have to leave or file a PERM application and you can stay while it&#x27;s pending. H1B is transferable with minimal effort to a new employer;2. TN visa: available to Canadians. It&#x27;s a 3 year nonimmigrant intent visa that requires. It can technically be renewed repeatedly but CBP is free to decide you&#x27;re really living here and just deny your visa. The conservative approach is that TN holders wishing to immigrate will transfer to an H1B when possible. H1Bs can have weird conditions like when and how often you can re-enter the country. Some countries don&#x27;t allow re-entry beyond the first year so leaving means going to a consulate and applying for a new visa;3. E3 visa: much like a TN but available to Australians. It&#x27;s 2 years, nonimmigrant intent and not transferable. There&#x27;s a quota but it&#x27;s never been hit. Many wishing to get a green card will also try to get an H1B at some point;4. L1 visa: large companies use this for transfers. Work in Canada or London for a year and then get transferred.This brings us to PERM. It&#x27;s basically a 2 step process:1. File a PERM. This involves many steps like getting a labor certification. This takes 6-24+ months. USCIS may randomly audit you, which can add 1-2 years. They may have a reason too but but they also randomly audit a large number of applications, allegedly to stop the system being gamed. The reality is that it&#x27;s arbitrary and capricious. Things may just randomly take 2 years longer for no reason at all. Once your number comes up (more on this below), you go to the next step;2. File an adjustment of status (\"AoS\"). There are 2 forms that can be filed concurrently (I-141 and I-485 IIRC). This should only take 6-12 months. It depends on your service center though. If there&#x27;s something weird about your application it may take longer with multiple rounds of RFE (\"Requests for Evidence\") that each take months to be examined.PERMs have a total quota and a per-country quota (of 7% of the total). And by \"country\" I mean \"country of birth\". Your passport doesn&#x27;t matter at all. If you&#x27;re born to Norwegian parents in Mumbai, you&#x27;ll be in the India queue and you don&#x27;t want to be there. Expect to wait 10-30 years because there is a backlog in the millions.Occasionally there&#x27;s some talk of Congress reforming this but nothing much has changed in a long time.So where&#x27;s the abuse? It takes 2 forms:1. The Department of Labor is meant to ensure you&#x27;re not underpaid (ie exploited). But they look at average pay for software engineers in a geographic area. For a Big Tech company, this could be substantially higher. But they don&#x27;t have to pay you that higher amount technically because you&#x27;re beholden to the company. If you leave you need to file a new PERM (but you keep your priority date). Still, this might add a year or two; and2. Oncd you have your green card you don&#x27;t need work authorization anymore so you can freely take a new job. So if you&#x27;re from India you&#x27;re effectively an indentured servant for decades because of the backlog.So H1Bs have no per-country quota but green cards do. We issue way more H1Bs to Indian-born workers than we issue green cards to so the queue is only getting longer. Bear in mind tooo that if you&#x27;re a worker with a spouse and two children you&#x27;ll need 4 from the quota not 1.So these bodyshop companies that employ a lot of Indian nationals flood the H1B pipeline. It&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a lottery. The companies don&#x27;t care who does and doesn&#x27;t get a visa. These are relatively low paying jobs, which in practice have bad conditions. The threat of being fired keepes workers from demanding better pay and conditions let alone leaving.Was apple engaging in these practices? I have no idea (and certainly no direct knowledge). But that&#x27;s what PERM abuse looks like.Honestly, work visas should just automatically convert to a green card after 6 years. reply civilized 6 hours agoparent> So if you&#x27;re from India you&#x27;re effectively an indentured servant for decades because of the backlog.> Honestly, work visas should just automatically convert to a green card after 6 years.Taking us from an extreme form of indentured servitude to the kind that was commonly practiced in the 18th century.

The article makes it sound like they did this for no reason, but the point of these hidden PERM positions is to be escape valves for the bonkers H1B system, which otherwise requires that skilled, valuable employees get booted out of the country after 3-6 years. If the government doesn&#x27;t want Apple jumping through loopholes they should pass a more reasonable skilled visa program. reply shadowgovt 11 hours agoparentStill a bit hard to explain why Apple appeared to be hiding these jobs from qualified native candidates, refugees, and asylees. reply jboy55 10 hours agorootparentThese &#x27;Jobs&#x27; are already filled. Someone on an H1B, who&#x27;s working at the job, in some cases for years, asks for the company to get them their green card. The company now has to advertise that job, and take applicants on the job.Theoretically if they find a qualified candidate they have to fire the worker who asked for PERM, and hire the candidate. Since PERM applications are seen as a perk for good employees, and having to fire the employee who asked for PERM if the process finds someone, companies hide the job applications, and find any reason to reject any applicant.The whole process is ridiculous. reply ralferoo 10 hours agorootparent> Theoretically if they find a qualified candidate they have to fire the worker who asked for PERM, and hire the candidate.This doesn&#x27;t seem like the only option to me.

The 99% scenario is you&#x27;ve already got an employee who is on a non-immigrant visa, that you&#x27;re invested in, and that you want to get onto the green card trajectory. reply VinLucero 11 hours agoparentWhat are the incentives at Play here? You seem to know the rules of the game. reply bubblethink 10 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s the lay of the land:1) You can hire temp workers on visas relatively easily and in large numbers. This benefits employers, politicians, economy, etc.2) These workers need permanent status. US immigration is uniquely regressive in that everything flows through the employer in most cases and visa holders have no agency. So the employer needs to petition for a \"permanent\" employee.3) So although these people are already employed, the employer needs to go through a PERM process where they advertise the job and claim to the gov. that they couldn&#x27;t hire anyone else and this is the most qualified employee for the job.4) Although it&#x27;s a farce, DOJ gets mad if there is a perception that the employer tried to make the PERM process more favorable to the employee they already have. reply NovemberWhiskey 10 hours agorootparentAnd if this doesn&#x27;t make it seem farcical enough: you would think that an employee who&#x27;d been working at your firm would have lots of unique skills and familiarity with corporate processes, technology etc. that are valuable, and that you could write a job description that required those.But no - your immigration law firm will tell you that you absolutely can&#x27;t do that, and that you have to pretend to hire into some kind of imaginary position that reflects the knowledge and skills of someone in the job market who would qualify but for the fact that they don&#x27;t have skills that could only be acquired at your firm. reply cogman10 10 hours agorootparentprevFor a non-citizen, becoming a citizen is a long process (Generally more than a few years). To actually stay in the US and move the process along employer sponsorship is key.This long process incentives non-citizens to do work at below market rates and to put up with less than ideal employment treatment. Which is great for most businesses as they can get a dev for cheap that they can work for long hours and hold their current residency in the US hostage (it&#x27;s not a simple process to switch employers).However, the law has on the books for programs like this and H1B that a company has to have first failed to fill their position with a US citizen. Apple is not unique here in fudging the \"tried to fill the position\" requirement. I suspect there&#x27;s more than a few big name company&#x27;s HR departments seeing this news and getting a little worried.I should note, the law also says PERM employees should be payed market rate... but market rate is a flexible thing and PERM employees are much less likely to complain. reply NovemberWhiskey 10 hours agorootparentprevSay you have an employee that you&#x27;ve hired on an H-1B. They&#x27;re a high-performer, and you want to retain them. You can only (not really, but mostly) stay beyond six years in the US on an H-1B if you&#x27;re on a green card trajectory - meaning that your employer has at least got a pending labor certification application for your position.Getting labor certification involves demonstrating that you&#x27;ve made a good faith effort to hire a US native worker to fill the position. So you have to try to hire into the role; but you really don&#x27;t want the search to succeed - because you&#x27;ve already got a good employee that&#x27;s a known quantity.Getting labor certification is a pre-requisite to getting an I-140, which is a pre-requisite to the employee getting the green card. Failing to achieve labor certification just delays the entire process and means yet more paperwork and time with the immigration attorneys. reply filoleg 10 hours agorootparentprevIncentive: you already have an employee on a visa working for you. They are a solid proven employee that you already invested money and other resources into (hiring&#x2F;recruiting costs, onboarding, training, visa paperwork, time of other engineers helping them out during onboarding, etc.). The employee understandably wants to continue working here or, at least, remain in the country. You, as the employer, can either sponsor their green card and go through PERM or risk losing them in the near future (either to a competitor who is willing to sponsor it or due to them leaving the country voluntarily or them getting hit with some visa issues further on). The incentive here is clear.So you decide to sponsor their green card process (as it makes sense in pretty much every aspect). Part of the application requirements is documentation proving that the employee that you are sponsoring isn’t displacing local workers and is truly high skill (given that H1B visa to green card conversion is intended for high-skill workers). The way that a lot of employers seem to be doing it is posting lowkey ads in newspapers and other places that technically would qualify, but that are unlikely to catch interest of potential candidates and are way more likely to go unnoticed. Then you wait some period of time. I don’t remember how long it is more precisely, but i remember that it is somewhere between 1-6 months. In the end, you got the document required to go forward with the process.My guess is that for large tech companies like FAANG it wouldn’t work like that, as their job postings are everywhere. But i think the fact that their interviews are notoriously difficult to pass (relative to most jobs outside of tech, where getting an interview itself is usually way more difficult, but once you got it, you are more likely to pass), that might work as a documented proof. Not sure, as I have never observed how those companies handle it, but I have seen some small employers do variations of the dance that I have described in the previous paragraph. reply ren_engineer 11 hours agoprev [–] >Apple agreed to pay up to $25 million in back payI&#x27;m sure that will be devastating for a company with 162 Billion in cash and really make them think twice reply deathanatos 8 hours agoparent [–] I usually scale these to \"if we fined a normal person\".

So this isn&#x27;t really suspicious at all.Sure it&#x27;s a US-focussed index, but isn&#x27;t that you want from your politicians? (Outsider perspective here fwiw.)

I have personally seen this in other contexts where people know something presumed private about a company, assume it’s a bigger deal than it is, and trade on that information.It’s also likely that there are a lot of politicians who are generally just as bad as the average person at stockpicking.All this combined, and it’s reasonable that the overall trend will be mostly in-line with the market, but likely overperforming sonewhat in the long run based on the volume and quality of insider trades.

For example when I worked in the securities division of Goldman there was a restricted list of stocks that I was not allowed to own (because we were publicly doing something for them) and then I had to send all my trades through the employee trading desk because they had another list which was the restricted list where the deals weren&#x27;t public yet so say we were going to be advising XYZ corp on a potential takeover of MNO corp. Only the people on that deal team would know anything about it, so XYZ and MNO stock wouldn&#x27;t be on the restricted list but if I tried to buy or sell either of those stocks in my personal account I wouldn&#x27;t be allowed. And there were other restrictions as well.When I worked for a software company I wasn&#x27;t allowed to trade in any stock of any of our clients or prospective clients and I had to sign a thing saying I wasn&#x27;t going to trade based on any client information that was disclosed to me in the course of doing business with the client. etcThese kinds of restrictions are absolutely normal in business. Additionally, in other countries, politicians don&#x27;t have this sort of carve-out on insider trading laws. This wouldn&#x27;t be some kind of slippery slope. For example in the UK, members of parliament have to publish their financial interests to avoid these kinds of conflicts https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publications.parliament.uk&#x2F;pa&#x2F;cm&#x2F;cmregmem&#x2F;contents22... reply thayne 5 hours agorootparentprevI kind of think that lawmakers should have to live off of the median income of the area people governed, so that in order to improve their own finances, they have to improve the situation for everyone. reply chii 4 hours agorootparentEmpathy cannot be forced. reply tacitusarc 5 hours agorootparentprevI actually don’t see how this follows reply kevinpet 7 hours agorootparentprevYou could say it doesn&#x27;t matter and they need to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, and I would agree. However, it seems clear that the entire point of this particular trading bot and the project is in fact whether politicians did better than another investing approach. reply mewpmewp2 7 hours agorootparentprevAre you saying they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to buy stock at all?Because you could cherry-pick any period of time to highlight that they have outperformed the market. reply CydeWeys 7 hours agorootparentThat would be a very reasonable restriction. Anyone who works on Wall Street can only own broad index mutual funds. reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentIt may have changed recently but that&#x27;s not quite how the restrictions worked on Wall St in my experience (8yrs in the front office at Goldman). There are lots of restrictions to the point where owning broad funds often becomes simpler, but you can do single-stock trades etc if you want to.See another comment where I explain more but how it used to work for me was you have to trade through the employee trading desk (and aren&#x27;t allowed to have unmonitored brokerage accounts) then any trade gets vetted against various lists (some but not all of which are available to you ahead of time to protect deal confidentiality) and then there are static criteria about how long you have to hold particular positions etc. reply bmitc 7 hours agorootparentprev> Are you saying they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to buy stock at all?There are several jobs that are less powerful and have less conflicts of interest where that is indeed the policy. reply BobaFloutist 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah probably not individually.They could put investment money in like an independent index fund maybe...?

If you limited to Sears, would you want Lowes, Home Depot, and Best Buy to exist?Basically any restriction that can be imagined would incentive various other bad behaviors that might actively be anticompetitive. reply alooPotato 7 hours agorootparentprevi think thats the point?better than favoring just a few stocks you have insider info on... reply kbenson 4 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a huge difference between the occasional company getting the occasional boost when some individual lawmaker or a small group of them can finagle something good for a company compared to every single lawmaker being aligned and wanting certain companies that they all agree on to succeed over others purely because it&#x27;s beneficial for them and not necessarily because the market views them as better or the general public benefits.A free market is a system that&#x27;s based on emergent behavior. As we see time and time again, even the best and most useful and narrowly focused regulations that are beneficial when first implemented need constant review to make sure they aren&#x27;t later doing more harm than good. Carving out a big chunk of the market as likely to get special behavior regardless of the normal inputs and outputs could outright be disastrous, IMO. reply fbuslop 6 hours agorootparentprevIt actually would be worse.

Sometimes also grandparents and grandchildren.If you mean something like that then your proposal seems overly restrictive. I don&#x27;t see any point in say the USGS not being able to hire a seismologist they want to hire because the seismologist can&#x27;t convince his brother to sell his Microsoft stock and his adult daughter to get rid of her Apple stock. Nothing that seismologist would be able to working at USGS is going to influence those stocks, nor is his work going to provide him with any inside information. reply dmckeon 6 hours agorootparentOkay, make that spouse instead, because spousal immunity. Also, make the funds&#x27; holdings temporarily blind: a fund does not reveal the entirety of the holdings in its portfolio until 5 years after year-end, and waits 3 months after the closing of a position to reveal that it held XYZ, Inc. during a 37 month period. The idea is not to try to exactly match \"the economy\" with \"the market\" or even with \"the funds\" but to disincentivize politicians making any direct connection between their work and with individual equities, while still being able to benefit from general economic growth. reply reidacdc 8 hours agoparentprevEven more radical proposal: Make this restriction on senior corporate officers.

Compared to the status quo, you&#x27;ll eliminate some good people who would have been happy enough putting their investments in a blind trust and not been acting out of conflicts with their own investments, and you&#x27;ll eliminate some people for whom the ability to serve their own investments was a deciding factor, but there&#x27;s all kinds of corrupt interests that don&#x27;t rely on having investments in ones own name that people pursue in politics. reply chii 4 hours agorootparentprev> There are actually people that aren&#x27;t self interested in public service, they do exist.relying on altruism is not what i would call scalable nor stable.The rules of the system should be such that the optimal&#x2F;desirable behaviour is also the selfish behaviour.

    "originBody": "Posted on November 9, 2023November 10, 2023 by Jeff How to Boss Without Being Bossy Leaders command people. That’s kind of what a leader is: someone with the authority to direct the actions of others. But people don’t often appreciate being commanded. When you step into leadership you face this challenge: how do you direct the members of your team without offending them? How do you become a good boss, but not be “bossy”? It’s worth starting this discussion with the reminder that most of what bosses do isn’t bossing at all. Although a leader can tell people what to do, we should be slow to do so. Most team discussions are dynamic and interactive. They should involve everyone without imposing much hierarchy. As a team we cultivate ideas. We imagine solutions. We consider potential tasks. We settle on a plan. The best work happens when the whole team is involved in understanding the problem, the chosen solution, and each person’s role in making it happen. Then each member has the knowledge and ownership to handle tasks skillfully and with passion. The leader’s primary job is to nurture this discussion, to make sure there is a divergence of options and then a convergence to a solid choice. Often this leadership involves no “bossing” at all. But sometimes we should and must tell people what to do. Sometimes people need the clarity, the unambiguity of a direct instruction. Sometimes we do assign tasks. “You do this.” We should rarely say it like that. Usually there are better ways to give a command, ways that make our purpose clear while honoring and respecting the listener. It is possible to issue a command without it feeling like a command. Even the word “command” can feel abrasive. But I’m going to use that term in this article. Technically, if you as a person in authority direct someone else to perform a task, you are commanding them. The question we’ll answer today, then, is: how do you give a command in a way your team members will accept, won’t reject as “bossy,” and might even feel good about? We’re going to focus on words. When you know you have to give a command (or directive or instruction or assignment), what words should you use? Body language matters too. Tone of voice matters. The conversation that surrounds the command—what comes before and after—matters a lot. But today let’s dive into the nitty-gritty. What are the best words to use? Here’s a couple of examples. “Get this done!” That’s pretty harsh. Maybe sometimes this level of directness is necessary, but it’s no way to win friends or influence people. “Do you think we could maybe see about possibly…” That’s pretty cagey. You may come across sounding weak, and your directive may get lost. The English language offers a wealth of options for how to give a command. Let’s look at them and consider which work best in this or that situation and which, if any, are never good for any situation. We’ll consider the example of telling someone to take out the trash—something most of us have been asked or told to do at some point. We’ll consider different ways you might command someone to take out the trash, see how it feels, and consider how clear the command is and how harsh it may feel. Command forms plotted against clarity and harshness From this menu of command forms you can build your own style of how, when the occasion warrants, you direct members of your team to do things. A Taxonomy of Commands “Take out the trash.” The simplest and most direct way to give a command is to use a straightforward imperative verb. “Drive me to the airport.” “Send me the report by the end of the day.” “Turn in your homework.” These are uncomplicated, bald directives that state the intended action plainly and make no bones about who’s the boss and who’s the bossed. The benefit of using a direct imperative is that your intention is perfectly clear. The listener knows what you want done and who you want to do it. The downside is harshness. Although there are more abrasive ways to give a command (we’ll get to those), the imperative feels pretty in-your-face in most business cultures. Usually (but not always) there’s a better choice. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★★☆ “Please take out the trash.” The word “please” has an interesting and hard-to-define role in English usage. “Please” breaks down hierarchy and puts you on the same footing as your listener. It reaffirms the listener’s choice in the matter. Between friends, family members, and other peers it’s a crucial word, converting a command into an appeal. You must judge for yourself what its effect is on the lips of a leader in a business setting. The effect varies widely based on circumstances and persons. In general it has the advantage of coming across as appealing and polite. It has the disadvantage of not quite making the command definite. “Please” gives the listener an option. Do they really have an option? If the command really is indefinite—if you’re willing for the listener to say “no”—then “please” is just the right word to add. But if the listener is really obligated to obey, “please” might either make everyone feel better by preserving the public honor of the listener—the illusion of choice—or make everyone feel worse by exposing the leader as manipulative. On balance, when giving your listener a real choice, adding “please” makes your request both clearer and more polite. And keep “please” in mind while considering the other forms of command in this list. “Please” can be sprinkled into almost statement with similar, polite-ifying effects as the ones we discovered here. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ “Maybe take out the trash?” With the addition of one little word—”maybe”—and perhaps an upturned note at the end of the sentence to make it a question, the straightforward imperative becomes a much gentler request. The benefit is that you sound less bossy. The downside is that the command has lost its teeth, and the person you’re speaking to may simply ignore you. Leaders who direct others with “maybe” generally appear weak. You might make it work for your leadership style. Probably not. Clarity: ★★☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ “You’d better take out the trash.” Adding “you’d better” to the start of any imperative adds a note of menace, a threat. Whether you say it or not, the phrase “or else…” creeps onto the back of the command. This is almost never a good move. Tossing a threat, however implied, toward someone you want or need to have a lasting relationship with is always counterproductive. The threat weakens the relationship. There’s a further problem: the threat actually weakens the command itself. The fact that you have to invoke “you’d better” to get this person to do something shows that you don’t really have the innate authority to compel them to do it. The threat, not your own leadership, holds the power. With a command like this you might get someone to do something once, but your authority over this person—and anyone observing the exchange—now lives on borrowed time. “You’d better” tends to be the weapon of choice of bullies and demagogues. You’d better avoid it. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★★★★ “You will take out the trash.” One of the English language’s favorite ways of softening an imperative is to turn it into the future tense. On the face of it the future tense looks as if it’s expecting us to predict what the listener will do. “I am Carmac the Magnificent and I foresee that you will…take out the trash!” But we know that in fact this is a directive rather than a prediction, yet a slightly softer directive than the bare imperative. How does it come across to the listener? The answer varies. If you stress the word “will” (or, heaven forbid, transmogrify it to “shall”), the directive is quite harsh and even threatening. But good leaders can say, “You will…” in a calm and inoffensive tone and convey a sense of solidity rather than threat. “What you’re going to do is to get the kitchen cleaned up. After that you’ll take out the trash.” In effect they’re directing: “Get the kitchen cleaned up. After that, take out the trash.” But the future tense with the proper tone comes across a little more gently. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★★☆ “I want you to take out the trash.” To my ear this is slightly gentler than a stark, “Take out the trash,” but tone of voice can make all the difference. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★★☆ “I need you to take out the trash.” The differences between these various ways of asking someone to do something may strike you as overly subtle, but often a grain of change can make a heap of difference. The shift here from “want” to “need” makes this command much more forceful, yet without seeming particularly harsh. “I need you to…” is a very popular way of commanding. Many leaders prefer it over any other form. I’ve even seen it taught in assertiveness training classes. The reason it works so well is that it makes an appeal to the listener that is very forceful yet neither threatening nor invasive. In essence you’re asking for help: “I have this need, you see? Would you meet my need?” It’s not you that demands so loudly that this person obey your request, it’s your need that makes the demand. “I have this need, and you can help me meet my need by doing this.” The phrase “I need you to” gives the directive a softer, less “bossy” quality than some alternatives. Yet it is forceful. A listener will find it very difficult to evade this form of command. To do so they must in essence respond with, “No, you don’t need that.” That kind of response takes brass. It means making a higher claim about your needs than you yourself are making. The listener must say, in effect, “You say that you need me to do that, but you’re wrong. What you really need is….” Only a very well-informed and knowledgable—or else stupid and insubordinate—listener will reply like this. Sometimes it is the right reply, and if you as a leader are telling people that you need them to do something, you’d better actually need it. This is a bluff that can be called. In normal circumstances “I need you to…” is a tried-and-true way of issuing a command that carries great force without seeming excessively harsh, and is therefore quite common. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ (and yet forceful) “Would you mind taking out the trash?” Here is one of the most common—and grammatically vexing—of English request forms, but also among the most effective. The fact that the listener must answer with “no” in order to agree to your request never ceases to befuddle. As with adding “please” to a request, “would you mind” softens by transforming a demand into a plea. It is virtually illegal, culturally speaking, to answer with “yes,” as if you minded (even if you would). Instead the listener is obligated to refuse the request in some more deliberate way: “Well, actually I’m tied up just now” or something similar. Consequently this is one of those magic request forms (like “I need you to…”) that applies more force with less harshness. “Would you mind” gives a less clear command than the bare imperative in that the user may refuse. The “answer yes by saying no” twisteroo also adds a little mental complication. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ “I‘m going to get you to take out the trash.” By prefacing the imperative with several filler words, we dull the edge of the command while keeping the meaning fairly clear (though not as clear as the bare imperative). There’s not much mistaking what is supposed to be done or who is to do it, yet a little wiggle room has been left to the listener. Several of the phrases on this list use this technique: make the command longer to make it less harsh, but also less clear. Personally I find this phraseology irritating. It can perhaps feel more gentle than a bare imperative but it also sounds more toadying and manipulative. For my own preference, a leader tempted to hedge with “I’m going to get you to…” would do better to skip the rigmarole and just say what they want. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ “I’ll let you take out the trash.” Another softening-by-lengthening technique, now with the added twist of implying that the listener wants to do the task. To me it sounds manipulative, but it has the further disadvantage of lost clarity. The listener may reply (mentally or aloud), “You’re letting me? So if I don’t want to, I don’t have to?” The task may not get done, and you as leader won’t have much of an excuse for why you didn’t make your requirement clearer. Clarity: ★★★☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “I’d like for the trash to be taken out.” It’s remarkable how often you’ll hear phrases like this in meetings at every level of an organization. A leader knows what they want done and who they want to do it, but by omitting the subject of the command—“you”—they hope to make it less bossy. Indeed, they hope the listener will reply, “Okay, I’ll take out the trash.” Sometimes this works. More often, everyone sits on their hands, waits for the moment to pass, and the command is ambiguously lost as the meeting moves on. There is a time for leaders to suggest a task and allow followers to volunteer to take it on. But it’s best to make that dance explicit. “Somebody needs to take the trash out. Who’ll do it?” Trying to hedge your command as an invitation for volunteerism is usually just weak and ineffective. If you know that you’re speaking to John, and everyone knows that you’re speaking to John, then speak to John. Don’t imply commands. Clarity: ★★☆☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Will you/Would you take out the trash?” On the face of it, it looks as if the English language, by offering this form of request, is inviting the listener to proclaim a prophetic oracle. A cheeky reply would be, “I don’t know whether I’ll take out the trash—am I supposed to be able to see the future?” In reality, of course, the future tense of the verb is a softer way to frame an imperative mood. Phrasing the command in the form of a question softens it further. The question implies—truly or falsely—that the listener has a choice. This is a good and of course very common way of asking people to do things, quite clear and not terribly harsh. Your parents and teachers probably used it with you. Don’t be too shy about using it with your team. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Could you/Can you take out the trash?” Likewise, “could you/can you” feels slightly quaint, almost archaic, and holds a note of appeal (as opposed to command) that might work well for your style of leadership. Or not. Something to experiment with? Clarity: ★★★☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Let’s take out the trash.” Another way of softening a command is to put it into the plural first person (“we/us”) instead of the second person (“you”). “Let’s…” is very commonly used by leaders and probably shouldn’t be. It tries to avoid harshness by sacrificing clarity, but usually loses more than it gains. The real subject of the command—you—is hidden, and unless the context has made the subject clear, the command will be lost. When you mean “you,” say “you.” Still, “Let’s…” has its place in a leader’s toolbox, as for example when the person responsible for the task has already been made explicit and the leader’s significant choice is not who will do it but what they will do. In that case, “Let’s take out the trash” may not be a hedging way of saying “You take out the trash,” but rather, “You’ll take out the trash instead of taking out the recycling.” Clarity: ★★☆☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Why don’t we take out the trash?” Again an overused hedge but not without its place. It is extremely soft but also extremely unclear. Are you actually asking someone to do something? In the middle of an exploratory discussion, asking “why don’t we” or “what if” questions is helpful in cultivating new options or narrowing toward a final choice. But as a final choice, “Why don’t we…” is too cautious and vague. Make a clear choice of who is to do what and then tell them clearly to do it. Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ “Could we take out the trash?” Similar in form and effect to “Why don’t we…?” See the discussion there. Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ “If you would just take out the trash…” Couches the command in the form of an “if” statement, usually with disastrous results. Sometimes leaders let the ellipsis dangle, just like that: “If you would just take out the trash…”—followed by an uncomfortable silence in the room. This is bad. Sometimes they fill the ellipsis with some convenient apodosis: “If you would just take out the trash, we could wash out the bin and maybe it wouldn’t smell so much.” This is equally bad. What little imperative force was implied by the initial “If you would…” becomes lost in the succeeding drivel. “If you would…” simply fails as a means of commanding (or even asking) someone to do something. It stages a desperate ploy to sound less bossy, but still comes across as bossy, yet in an evasive and pandering manner. Avoid it. A common variant has “could” in place of “would.” I don’t see a great difference. Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ If you want to be a good boss without being seen as bossy, mull over this list. Watch how other leaders use phrases like these and what effect they have. Try out new ways of issuing commands, see how they feel to you, see how people respond. The key is to find a way of directing people that suits your personality, your team, and your organization’s culture. Once you settle on a comfortable style and make it consistent, then you’ll be seen as a leader who knows how to get people to do things without coming across as obnoxious.

I&#x27;d like to see a lot more of that, but the default often seems to be blame.I recall a system at a place I worked where the stakeholders (native or skilled non-native English speakers) would produce requirements by holding meetings with the developer (much less skilled non-native speaker), dictate what they wanted, and have the developer take notes (which the stakeholders would not check) then immediately implement the software. When the resulting software was built incorrectly they would blame the developer for incompetence, and hold another meeting. reply jmye 6 hours agoparentprevI think the article’s advice to think about and notice phrasing is good: we should all be aware of the words we use, and how they sound.But I think your suggestions mirror my experience in actually getting the person to do the thing.

However, one thing I have found is that when you go around telling people to do things, they frequently tend to do them.Sometimes, that&#x27;s fine. After all, I would assume no rational human is going to \"command\" someone to do a thing if they don&#x27;t think they want that thing done.

That&#x27;s the risk you have to take as a leader.

But, if it&#x27;s a life or death type matter, fuck the long term -- you have to survive the short term before you start worrying about that.

As a leader, you need to establish a rapport (with someone who is anyway initially inclined to desire rapport with you, because you&#x27;re their boss and have outsize influence over future compensation) and negotiate over high-level context: IC availability and understanding what problems need solving. If everyone understands the problem and there&#x27;s mutual trust, the details take care of themselves.Of course, \"establish mutual trust\" is a whole megillah unto itself. But if it exists, \"take out the trash\" is not bossy. If it doesn&#x27;t exist, \"could we take out the trash?\" is incredibly rude. reply neontomo 3 hours agoparentI agree with you. Looking for the right word is missing the point and to me feels like overanalysing instead of understanding. I&#x27;ve only worked in one manager position but I noticed that different people liked different styles - some want to understand why we&#x27;re doing something and figure out the best way to do it themselves, as it gives them agency and confidence in their abilities - others felt overwhelmed and wanted a more direct approach (do this, in this specific way, in this amount of time) and didn&#x27;t care what the reason was.If your staff knows your character and that you will stand up for them and back their needs in the work place, the phrasing is secondary.

At my last position (from which I was unfortunately laid off a few months ago) as a senior staff engineer at a ~100 person startup with a ~30 person engineering org, my manager, the CTO, raised this to an art form. I joked with our other senior staff engineer (whom I hired) that our manager never said anything but \"Figure it out.\" Once, after an eng all hands meeting, I Slacked my colleague and said \"Well, if that wasn&#x27;t peak $CTO-NAME, I don&#x27;t know what is. I&#x27;m pretty sure what I just heard was the 25 minute version of &#x27;figure it out.&#x27;\"\"Figure it out\" is a great message when you have a talented group of engineers working with you. They&#x27;re experts at what they do, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten hired. \"Figure it out\" gives them room to get shit done, and it also goes a long way toward validating any concerns they might express. It&#x27;s almost magical, really.I worked there for almost a year, and I what I just wrote here for all of you is the absolute most valuable thing I learned in all that time. As a leader, telling smart, curious, and deeply technical people to \"figure it out\" will get you everything you ever dreamed of and more.The only problem is that if you&#x27;re not careful, you can end up talking too much, which leads to the other half of the lesson: shut the fuck up. Literally just stop talking, and leave some space in the conversation that you&#x27;re not filling up with words. It&#x27;s best if you can stop talking right as you&#x27;ve sketched out the barest outlines of a big idea, or told a good story, or you&#x27;ve just got something that&#x27;s conceptually interesting to drop in the other person&#x27;s lap.Once you do that, \"figure it out\" + interesting idea + \"shut the fuck up\" is just like weaponized nerd sniping. reply opportune 2 hours agoparentprevI don’t think this is necessarily true. Delegation is the name of the game in any large organization - managers exist to sift down tasks to a doer. You can’t delegate many kinds of tasks by inspiring people.

Also the nature of the work itself - if must-haves totally book your team you really can’t give them much flexibility or autonomy outside those must-haves. reply mattnewport 2 hours agoprevAnyone saying \"I need you to...\" just makes me think of Bill Lumbergh from Office Space.

I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s at the heart of what being considered \"bossy\" is, so working on it won&#x27;t likely fix that. reply kevinmchugh 5 hours agoparentSimilarly (and at risk of focusing too much on the example), in a high competency and high trust environment, identifying a task as quotidian as taking out the trash ought to be pretty rare.

Some cultures have a strong sense of hierarchy, which in their business interactions is expressed in the petty, demeaning game of \"act like a sycophant insect to those above you and treat those below you as pawns to be commanded\", which has the same effect as what you&#x27;re describing, but civilized people tend to reject that.Edit: Note that this is not a defense of the article, which starts off incorrect at sentence one. It&#x27;s easy to confuse the concept of a command hierarchy, like a military, and a cooperation hierarchy, which is the way a healthy business operates (though this is perhaps the minority of businesses, because a command hierarchy is more effective if your employees mostly don&#x27;t give a shit or are miserable or incompetent, any of which problems may or may not be their fault). reply financltravsty 3 hours agorootparentNot all humans are equal. Some still retain the spirit of wonder and awe -- dare I say zest -- that allows them to find inspiration. Whether that is through internal or external means, they still can be impelled to act by the right stimulus.To be civilized is to bend to genteel sensibilities; and nothing inspiring ever comes from that. Logically sound, rational, and convincing sure; but never inspiring. reply throwaway914 8 hours agoparentprev [–] I agree. You don&#x27;t dispense vitriol, but people are way more willing to follow instructions from a perceived leader than we tend to believe. It&#x27;s not worth splitting hairs to finaggle every word to sound delicate and kind. If you assume authority, and you aren&#x27;t outright malevolent, you can usually tell someone:I need you to take out the trash. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

It sends secret credentials to Microsoft servers. Lesezeit: 5 Min. In Pocket speichern vorlesen Druckansicht Kommentare lesen 5 Beiträge (Bild: IB Photography/Shutterstock.com) 10.11.2023 15:34 Uhr c't Magazin Von Dirk Knop Ronald Eikenberg Stefan Wischner Inhaltsverzeichnis Microsoft lays hands on login data: Beware of the new Outlook New Outlook: Warning about data transfers Other accounts EU Data Protection Institutions get involved (This is a translation of this german article.) The new Outlook is not what it seems at first glance: a replacement for Microsoft Office Outlook - at least not yet. What it definitely is, however: way too curious. Microsoft is singing the praises of the new Outlook and wants to persuade users to switch. But beware: if you try out the new Outlook, you risk transferring your IMAP and SMTP credentials of mail accounts and all your emails to Microsoft servers. Although Microsoft explains that it is possible to switch back to the previous apps at any time, the data will already be stored by the company. This allows Microsoft to read the emails. The Windows Start menu shows new Outlook as recommendet App after installing Win11 2023 update. (Bild: Screenshot / rei) The new Outlook now appears as a recommended app in the Windows Start menu of Windows 11 devices with the 2023 update. The Outlook client itself also offers to test the new Outlook version with a \"The new Outlook\" switch. This is still under development, but is set to replace the mail program and the calendar included in Windows in 2024. In a recent tech community article, Microsoft employee Caitlin Hart also explains that it will also replace the classic Outlook. However, unlike the Windows Mail and Calendar apps, the timetable for this has not yet been set. New Outlook: Warning about data transfers When adding a mail account in the new Outlook that is not hosted by Microsoft but is located on company mail servers, for example, the program displays a message. It links to a support article that simply states that non-Microsoft accounts are synchronized with the Microsoft cloud, whereby Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and IMAP accounts are currently supported. The new Outlook also does this in the versions for Android, iOS and Mac. This means that copies \"of your email, calendar, and contacts will be synchronized between your email provider and Microsoft data center\". This gives the company full access to all emails and allows it to read and analyze them. Microsoft wants to provide functions that way that Gmail and IMAP do not offer. The new Outlook shows a message that it sends data to Microsoft Cloud servers. (Bild: Screenshot / rei) The note makes you wonder: What does Microsoft transfer where? When creating an IMAP account, c't was able to sniff the traffic between new Outlook and the Microsoft servers. It contained the target server, log-in name and password which were sent to those Servers of Microsoft. Although TLS-protected, the data is sent to Microsoft in plain text within the tunnel. Without informing or inquiring about this, Microsoft grants itself access to the IMAP and SMTP login data of users of the new Outlook. When adding an IMAP account, new Outlook sent login data and server information to Microsoft. (Bild: Screenshot) Other accounts When switching from the old Outlook to the new one, it is installed the new software in parallel. Previously set up IMAP accounts are not automatically transferred, but the account stored in Windows is. During the test with Google accounts, authentication with OAuth2 was used. Users receive an authentication request and Microsoft does not receive any specific access data, but only an access token that users can revoke again. An answer to our request for a statement from Microsoft is still pending. At this point in time, however, we must warn against trying out the new Outlook without thinking. In addition to all the emails, some credentials may even end up with Microsoft. Microsoft already attracted attention with such data redirections at the beginning of the year. After Office updates were applied on Mac computers, Outlook redirected the data to Microsoft's cloud servers without any user notification. At that time, the remedy was to delete IMAP accounts and set them up again. However, this is obviously no longer helpful with the new Outlook. EU Data Protection Institutions get involved The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, Professor Ulrich Kelber, is alarmed by the data detour in Microsoft's new Outlook. He posted on Mastodon that he wants to ask for a report from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who is responsible for companies like Microsoft, during a meeting of the European data protection supervisory authorities on Tuesday of the coming week.

If I was Google, I&#x27;d think about banning IMAP logins from the Azure servers that are doing this syncing. reply jkaplowitz 13 hours agorootparentIt uses OAuth2 rather than IMAP for Google accounts, as per Heise&#x27;s German-language reporting which was previously linked in HN (I haven&#x27;t yet checked their English-language article). So the Google account password doesn&#x27;t get sent to Microsoft servers or stored locally or anything, as it does with a regular IMAP account.Microsoft stores an OAuth2 access token for these accounts, which is still unnecessary compared to the locally synced version of Outlook we&#x27;re all used to, but the user can revoke it through Google account settings at any time, just like any other OAuth2 access token. reply olyjohn 14 hours agorootparentprevThe already call IMAP an inscure, outdated service. So when you enable it, they will disable it for you after so many days whether you want them to or not. reply andix 13 hours agorootparentI think it really is a security issue to some extent, because it doesn&#x27;t support multi factor authentication.For most services email is the master key to reset your password. By getting access to someone&#x27;s email account a lot of other accounts can be breached easily. I try to disable password reset via email wherever possible. But most services don&#x27;t provide this option.I think it would be time for IMAP to get a standardized way to log in via OAuth2&#x2F;OIDC. And maybe an update to the email standard to mark a recovery links or codes as secret, that require 2FA every time to read.Especially dangerous are servers that still allow using IMAP without TLS, that&#x27;s just asking for trouble. reply vasdae 14 hours agorootparentprevThat is false. reply wannacboatmovie 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s rich, considering Google invented email credential harvesting. reply cma 14 hours agorootparentprevGoogle won&#x27;t let you backup any parts of your phone without sending them your private wifi key. reply tempodox 18 hours agoparentprevYou can rely on Microsoft to come up with the next abuse and make a security hole out of it. reply pyeri 17 hours agoparentprevIs this the same company that once created remarkable technological innovations like Windows XP, .NET Framework, Visual Studio Express, etc?

A mail client that, somehow, only worked properly with other Office elements, and, at some point, it created interoperability issues if sender, receiver, and mail server, weren&#x27;t all running Microsoft software. reply fifteen1506 17 hours agorootparentSecure Mail (tm).Only available on Windows 12 devices with Microsoft-approved software.Only €99 the first 20 months, then triples.

That the desktop app re-uses the same APIs as the mobile app rather than process mail locally makes sense from a code reuse and efficiency standpoint, but really only because your accounts can seamlessly carry over to all your devices.It’s arguable that the distinction between keeping your password in the cloud and keeping your password local is a security risk. However, if you previously used Outlook.com to check your IMAP email, and maybe this is where the feature derives from, then you already provided your IMAP password to Microsoft on the web. Likewise Google for importing IMAP to Gmail. We do this because it is nicer to get one inbox and one push notification across multiple accounts - when we want cloud providers checking emails for us.It is less clear why a desktop app would do this unless you opted in to fancier service of some kind - e.g. viewing emails on the web when not at this device, or push notifications to your mobile phone, etc.If Microsoft wanted to read your emails even with a locally stored and never shared IMAP password, they could still send telemetry derived from the local client to build an advertising profile based on local emails, or to display targeted ads. They don’t technically need your password to read your emails if you are using their email client. reply fifteen1506 17 hours agoparentprevThe problem is Microsoft using its servers as the middle man, without fair warning. Not what you mentioned. reply wannacboatmovie 17 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right it&#x27;s totally different when Google does the same thing with Gmail. reply blkhawk 17 hours agorootparentFor GMail people set that up deliberately Outlook pretends to be a desktop app. reply wannacboatmovie 17 hours agorootparentThe kids call these Progressive Web Apps and half the posters here were complicit in developing the technology. reply Etheryte 17 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re wildly overestimating how much deliberation or thought the average Gmail user has put into any of these topics outside of \"free email, neat\". reply MereInterest 14 hours agorootparentprevThe difference between Gmail&#x27;s IMAP setup and this new Outlook IMAP behavior is the same difference between borrowing a friend&#x27;s car and stealing a friend&#x27;s car. In both cases, you&#x27;re driving a car that doesn&#x27;t belong to you. The difference is whether you have permission to be driving that car.Both Gmail and Outlook are receiving passwords, then using those to perform IMAP requests from their servers. The difference is that Gmail had permission to do so, while Outlook did not. reply MereInterest 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s to distinguish this behavior from password managers. Here, the message is sent to Microsoft in an encrypted form, but Microsoft can decrypt it to access the underlying password. For password managers, the remote server receives a password in an encrypted form, and cannot decrypt it to access the underlying password.It could have been phrased better, but the clear message is that Microsoft has pilfered access to unencrypted passwords, regardless of any transportation-level encryption. reply Retric 17 hours agoparentprevThe concern is someone logging into Gmail is sending plain text passwords and email contents to Microsoft. That’s why sending plain text passwords over an encrypted channel is a concern.It would be fine if Outlook was backing up encrypted data and then not sending the decryption key to Microsoft servers. reply Cu3PO42 17 hours agoparentprevIt is conceivable that they wanted to express \"although encrypted in transit, it is not hashed and Microsoft can recover the full password\". However, you&#x27;d have to be very charitable to interpret the articale like that.This is not a translation error either. The same mistake can be found in the German original.> Did whoever write this realize you need to be able to recover the cleartext for this to even work?The first author of the article has a degree in &#x27;commercial information technology&#x27; and has worked as a sysadmin, so I assume they do understand that this is necessary, they may just have done a bad job of expressing that.An article in a technical outlet should still do better in such regards. reply wannacboatmovie 16 hours agorootparentWait till they find out credit card numbers are not hashed and salted before being transmitted to a merchant over TLS. reply babypuncher 17 hours agoparentprevThe question is, why does Microsoft need your Gmail password at all to begin with?

But thanks for the clarification. reply distcs 16 hours agoprevSince FreeBSD is on the front page today, I thought this is a good time to learn from the collective wisdom of this community. 5 simple questions to those who use FreeBSD to stir up a conversation.1. Where do you use FreeBSD? On your laptop? Remote servers? Routers?2. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of Linux?3. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of OpenBSD or another *BSD?4. Do you find something lacking in FreeBSD? Is there something that is good in another OS that you&#x27;d like to see in FreeBSD?5. What is that one thing about FreeBSD that you would hate to lose if you were forced to use another OS? reply drewg123 13 hours agoparent1) Desktop, many thousands of remote severs2) Poor interactions with Linus, DaveM, and the Linux community (see below)3) Performance4a) A different package system, more akin to Ubuntu LTS with PPAs, so we could have stable packages for 99% of things, but could get the latest versions of software when needed.4b) ebpf&#x2F;xdp5) Missing ^T (SIGINFO) support, simple init system, a kernel that makes sense2 extended: In 1994, I was a linux fanatic, with a stack of floppies I&#x27;d use to install linux on any pc I could get my hands on. I landed a job as a sysadmin for a stats dept, where we were using ancient DECstations running ULTRIX. Disk space was expensive, and TeX fonts were large. So we kept TeX fonts centrally located in NFS. The DECstations were old and slow compared to PCs (12.5MHz mips, vs 66Mhz 486), so I wanted to replace them with PCs running Linux. The problem came that it took the DECs ~1 second to render latex .dvi file using xdvi. It took a linux box a minute or more. This was because the DECs did NFS file caching, while Linux didn&#x27;t, and xdvi seeked around at random in the font files.I went to the 1994 Boston USENIX and met Linus at the Linux BOF. I asked him about NFS file caching. He said something like \"bah, nobody uses NFS, we have no plans to implement any sort of NFS caching, its not important\".. So I got up, went to the FreeBSD BOF, and they said it should work just fine. I&#x27;ve been a FreeBSD user ever since.Then ~10 years later, working for a company making one of the first 10GbE NICs, I had submitted our base driver and got it accepted via the netdev list. I then completed work on TCP LRO in our driver, submitted that, and got it NACK&#x27;ed for the reasonable reason that they didn&#x27;t want to have multiple LRO implementations. EVEN THOUGH OUR COMPETITOR&#x27;S DRIVER HAD THEIR OWN LRO IN THEIR DRIVER, AND ANOTHER VENDOR SUBMITTED A DRIVER WITH THE BASE DRIVER AND LRO IN THE SAME PATCH AFTER US AND GOT IT ACCEPTED, AND THEY DIDNT RIP LRO OUT OF THE OTHER DRIVERS. So our driver had dog-shit performance out of the box due to a lack of LRO as compared to 2 of our competitors. At that point I was pretty much done with Linux.Compared to FreeBSD, where we had the best LRO in our driver, and a few other vendors copy&#x2F;pasted it, and it wound up eventually being centralized as tcp_lro.c and driver-specific LRO ripped out. reply gruturo 15 hours agoparentprev1. 2 laptops and quite a few servers, some remote, some local2. While I prefer FreeBSD, I use Linux too. I think it&#x27;s important to know more than one OS. Also my employer standardized on RHEL, not much choice there3. It seems to be the one where most of the (non-strictly-security-related) innovation takes place, and many of the OpenBSD security related innovation trickle down reasonably soon.4. Docker (hate it, love it, but so much software is distributed in this way now), recent WiFi adapters&#x2F;standards5. ZFS (I know it&#x27;s possible on Linux too now, but good luck convincing my employer, anything not covered by support is a tough cookie there), ZFS, ZFS, dtrace, its very nice update&#x2F;upgrade process, a sane and quite rich base system, the Ports collection, its very nice handbook and documentation. reply wkat4242 16 hours agoparentprevI use FreeBSD on my desktop. Not on a laptop because I hate laptops.I love it because it&#x27;s so simple and free of corporate influence compared to Linux. I hate corporations telling me what I should use (eg systemd).I use FreeBSD because it has the biggest software support. Using it with KDE.I love the ports collection, the separation between stable OS and rolling packages, excellent documentation, jails and ZFS and bectl.I don&#x27;t find anything lacking.

On my desktop.2. As of right now, mostly curiosity. I have dabbled in FreeBSD on and off for years, and every time I install something from scratch I give it another go. In addition, the experience is more cohesive and \"it just works\" compared to almost every Linux distro I&#x27;ve ever used (the closest I&#x27;ve found is Slackware.) Let me explain.When I say cohesive, I mean mostly that it has extremely well thought out documentation, and most common things you might want to do are in the FreeBSD handbook. Just go to the relevant chapter and read up.When I say \"it just works\", I don&#x27;t mean that the out of the box experience is just magically perfect and pre-configured like you might see on Windows or Ubuntu. What I mean is, the ports (and the pre-compiled packages made from them) are extremely reliable. You install them, and they work. Not to pick on Ubuntu specifically, but I have found this not to be the case more often on Ubuntu. Sometimes you install a package on Ubuntu, and it doesn&#x27;t just work, and you might have to hunt down a config file to make some adjustments, its location may or may not be different from vanilla and may or may not be documented, or maybe it&#x27;s a bad package and you&#x27;re SOL.Furthermore, I&#x27;ve found that upgrading ports and packages in FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t break things anywhere near as often as on most Linux distros I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very reliable in that sense, and it just works.3. This is older hardware for personal use, and I don&#x27;t really need the enhanced security of OpenBSD, especially the enhanced security that comes with a performance cost.As for NetBSD or DragonflyBSD, I have the impression, which may or may not be correct, that FreeBSD has better hardware support than either of them, and I want all of my peripherals to work.4. I do most of my gaming on dedicated hardware these days (Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch), but it would be super great if the experience of playing games was more smooth. Thanks to the magic of Linux binary compatibility and Proton, you can totally play Windows and Linux games on FreeBSD with decent success, but the process of setting that up is awkward and ad-hoc.5. See 2. Also, I like ZFS a lot, and I get the impression that getting up and running with ZFS on Linux is more of a hassle. reply kipukun 16 hours agoparentprev1. I use it on all of my servers.2. FreeBSD offers a coherent base system with sane tools. pf is a godsend, and the ports collection is a good trade-off of configuration and simplicity. ZFS used to be a killer feature but is being integrated into Linux systems.3. FreeBSD is designed around \"general purpose\" use and has a lot of backing from corporations like Netflix.4. FreeBSD is missing a true container solution that is compatible with Docker (jails don&#x27;t count). There has been some work on this as of the most recent BSDcon, so I&#x27;m hopeful.5. I never want to look at iptables again.EDIT: fix spacing reply pseudostem 16 hours agoparentprev1. Servers, I&#x27;m partial to openBSD because of a saner IMO &#x2F;etc and works-out-of-the-box (for me). My coworker is the more freebsd kind and since he does the work, his opinion prevails.2. I moved houses 3 days ago. Had installed MX linux prior to moving on my desktop computer. Today, no DHCP IP on my computer. Man and apropos didn&#x27;t help much. Ifconfig, arp don&#x27;t exist. They require an apt install. I&#x27;m clueless as to what&#x27;s happening. GUI tools didn&#x27;t help much. So yeah to all predictable systems including windows.3. VSCode (which when I last checked a week ago didn&#x27;t work on freebsd either) and a lot of other programs which aren&#x27;t there on OpenBSD. NetBSD haven&#x27;t touched, so won&#x27;t comment.4. Userland stuff. BSDs in general pitch themselves as complete OSs, but the whole getting X working is like assembling a GUI stack IMO.5. Continuing from the previous point (yeah, I&#x27;m a hypocrite), a few hundred MBs of RAM and very little GHzs on the CPU gets you a fully functional Desktop environment. If a browser is needed, add a bit more RAM and maybe some CPU.PS: I use really old hardware reply shiomiru 15 hours agorootparent> BSDs in general pitch themselves as complete OSs, but the whole getting X working is like assembling a GUI stack IMO.FWIW, NetBSD comes with X & ctwm out of the box. (But of course it&#x27;s not the same as a whole DE you get in Debian.) reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentprevVscode works totally fine, I use it all the time. It&#x27;s in the packages and ports. reply pseudostem 15 hours agorootparentI might be wrong, but VSCode didn&#x27;t work (for me) on 13.x and I ran across a few forum posts for others who couldn&#x27;t get it done either. I had very little time to figure out the right \"distro\", and VSCode was a requirement. Went to distrowatch, and installed the top choice (please don&#x27;t roast me about it). reply wkat4242 15 hours agorootparentHmm weird. Did you try to just do \"sudo pkg install vscode\" ?Don&#x27;t try to download it from the website, this won&#x27;t work as freebsd is not a supported platform but it&#x27;s simply in the package collection and works great as such. reply wkat4242 7 hours agorootparentprevPs I wasn&#x27;t trying to roast you at all. I&#x27;m happy you found a solution even if it&#x27;s not FreeBSD1. Where do you use FreeBSD? On your laptop? Remote servers? Routers?Right now, I run FreeBSD on a few machines: my rented server, my two home servers which also do redundant PPPoE + NAT, a NAT machine at my MIL&#x27;s that I also use for offsite backup of my home servers (I don&#x27;t trust the rented server enough to run backups there), additionally, I have two mini PCs setup to run mythtv frontend (but the backend is not currently running, because our tv habits have changed). My desktops are Windows. My wireless access points and I think my managed network switches are Linux, so is the ISP provided DSL modem and LTE to network device (which I believe also runs embedded Android on the actual modem). I do have an old acer chromebook that boots FreeBSD, but I haven&#x27;t used it in a while (my son used it for minecraft until an update changed a library and made it too hard to get working)2. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of Linux?I had great experiences with FreeBSD at Yahoo and WhatsApp, and bad experiences with systemd when Debian adopted it, so I decided to switch. And I&#x27;ve been mostly happy. Going between Yahoo and WhatsApp, I jumped about three major versions of FreeBSD in a weekend, and everything felt the same, but better. Jumping between major releases of Debian, lots of things feel different and sometimes better, sometimes worse, sometimes the same; I felt a lot of major changes I was dealing with were complicating my system to deal with use cases I didn&#x27;t care about, and that a lot of the worse offenders were coming from the same developers and I was tired of dealing with their software and tired of trying to get things to work without it.3. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of OpenBSD or another *BSD?IMHO, FreeBSD is focused on being practical and also has a performance focus. OpenBSD has a very opinionated security focus, which I apprechiate, but features needed for performance are missing and unlikely to arrive; I&#x27;m more willing to compromise security than performance, so there you go. I mentally associate NetBSD with portability, but I&#x27;m not running FreeBSD on exotic equipment, and not interested in fighting with my embedded Linux devices to get them to run software of my choice: been there, done that, I&#x27;d rather tilt at different windmills now.4. Do you find something lacking in FreeBSD? Is there something that is good in another OS that you&#x27;d like to see in FreeBSD?Hardware support is hit or miss. I have usb 2.5G nics I can&#x27;t use that I thought I&#x27;d be able to (but didn&#x27;t check, and I have other uses for, so no big deal). HDMI audio on certain generations of intel chips is difficult because the graphics and audio drivers need to coordinate on clock settings, but there&#x27;s no mechanism for that in FreeBSD, the Linux gpu driver is shimmed into the FreeBSD kernel, so that makes it trickier than it maybe already was. I had trouble getting FreeBSD installed on the chromebook I mentioned originally, but it did get fixed.Not having a large user community makes it hard for hardware&#x2F;software providers to get excited about providing support, because they don&#x27;t get a sense of return on investment.5. What is that one thing about FreeBSD that you would hate to lose if you were forced to use another OS?Stability of experience. I know that 90-95% of the skills and knowledge I develop on FreeBSD will apply to future releases. I&#x27;ve had to learn firewalls on Linux three times (of course, FreeBSD also has three firewalls, but they are all supported and all kind of different; I simultaneously use pf, because of pfsync which provides for seamless NAT failover and ipfw to do traffic shaping and network delay simulstions; I&#x27;ve never used ipf, but I assume it provides value to some), and I work with mixed versions of Linux for work and have to deal with sometimes ip, sometimes ifconfig, sometimes netstat, sometimes ss on a regular basis, and it makes no sense. FreeBSD has the same needs for interface config and routing and socket listing, and made the existing tools do it, rather than new tools that work the same but different. Who has time for that? If FreeBSD ends, which I don&#x27;t expect it to, I&#x27;ll just go live in a cave with the final release and the best computer I can put together that&#x27;s supported by the final release, and that will be my computing for the rest of my time. Honestly, while I sure computing will continue to develop, a big beefy box purchased today should get me a long time of continued use, so I&#x27;ll be fine. When it falls apart, maybe there will be a retro marketplace, or maybe I&#x27;ll move to assisted living. reply dveeden2 18 hours agoprevRelease Notes:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;releases&#x2F;14.0R&#x2F;relnotes&#x2F; reply nivenhuh 16 hours agoprevI’ve been evaluating FreeBSD, and the primary thing that I miss is the ease of use that comes with using docker images.The jails system + zfs is pretty nice.

Some of these changes were cherry-picked into the stable&#x2F;13 branch and were included in the FreeBSD 13.1 and FreeBSD 13.2 minor releases built from there.A sibling comment notes that APIs or ABIs may change between major versions. This is true, but this is not the reason for a new major version. Rather, ABI and API changes are allowed during the development cycle on the main branch, but are not cherry-picked into the existing stable branches.I have a proposed change to include in the release notes some significant changes that happened to have been merged into 13.x already, and so far have been excluded from 14.0&#x27;s notes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviews.freebsd.org&#x2F;D42546 reply throw0101b 18 hours agoparentprevAPIs are stable with-in major version numbers.

His reasoning boiled down to \"Linux is too popular\". The consequences of this choice would be significant, and that just isn&#x27;t a justified position so I bowed out. The project, unsurprisingly, was a failure. reply LeonenTheDK 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m curious if you could talk about any of the consequences at all. There&#x27;s a very similar situation unfolding at my company currently. New project running on FreeBSD because that&#x27;s what the admin likes, and he takes every opportunity to bash Linux that he can. I&#x27;d like to prepare for potential pitfalls best I can.We&#x27;ve already had issues around compatibility with third party software and OS upgrades (which surprised me in particular, likely a mistake on the admin&#x27;s part but I&#x27;m not privy to the details).FreeBSD seems like a wonderful OS for purpose-built hardware (eg pfsense, PlaystationOS, Netflix&#x27;s distribution servers), but I&#x27;d much prefer to be on something common for the general compute. I don&#x27;t even want to know what hiring another&#x2F;replacement admin will be like in the future (we&#x27;re entirely on-prem in a city that&#x27;s away from a major population centre, niche enough as it is without adding FreeBSD on top). reply toast0 16 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m curious if you could talk about any of the consequences at all.One major consequence is that your software and setup scripts are likely to continue to work over many major releases. Basic system tools don&#x27;t often get replaced, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about migrating to a new tool to configure interfaces, or a new firewall (although you do have three firewalls to choose from, they all have been there for a long time) or a drastically new init system etc.Otoh, there are many projects that are made for Linux only. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. Lots of assumptions creep in, people write Makefiles that need GNU make, and call make recursively with &#x27;make&#x27; instead of $(MAKE), but FreeBSD has BSD make as make, and GNU make, if you install it, as gmake. FreeBSD sets up cc to be llvm&#x27;s clang, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s common in Linux. Many projects compile with either, but some don&#x27;t. Specialized linking is tricky. Compiler and linker changes are probably an exception to my rule earlier about not replacing tools, but there&#x27;s a case to be made that clang is at least as good as gcc, and the license is a better fit; there&#x27;s no requirement that the base be all BSD licensed, but it&#x27;s nice to move in that direction where possible.System monitoring is different, but capabilities are roughly similar. FreeBSD has some nice things, and Linux has some nice things, I&#x27;ve got my preferences, but whatever.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to take a reasonable systems aware person and sit them down with a FreeBSD book and a FreeBSD system and get acceptable results. Yes, mastery takes time, but consultancies are available if you need mastery right now, and don&#x27;t have time to develop it in house. reply doublerabbit 17 hours agorootparentprevNormally the reasons for me don&#x27;t tend to fit those who use Linux. And then it always turn in to a pissing match of \"Linux can do that too\".

The biggest frustration I have is \"linux recipes\" for doing things often don&#x27;t work (naturally, since the OS is different), and electron apps are a crapshoot, since the electron is chrome, and the emulation needed for chrome is incomplete. For example, I&#x27;m listening to spotify right now and I can listen to playlists, but can&#x27;t just play a song..EDIT: One the things I loved about Ubuntu LTS is the packages being essentially frozen, aside from security fixes. FreeBSD is a \"rolling release\" OS for 3rd party packages, even on stable branches. That&#x27;s one of the reasons that I use the ubuntu LTS firefox ... I can apt-get update & apt-get upgrade just the web browser and its dependencies, rather than the 1700 unrelated packages that I&#x27;d need to update just to get the newest firefox. reply wkat4242 7 hours agorootparentVscode is also Electron and works great though. Chromium itself too.For Spotify I use spotify-qt which is ok (not great) though with the latest version from ports it refuses to store my password in the KDE keychain any longer :(Ps I actually love the rolling packages on FreeBSD while keeping a stable OS.

Things were different around 10, but nowadays, the support expectations are pretty clear[1]. FreeBSD 12 support ends at the end of this year, so not a good choice for new users; FreeBSD 13 support is expected to end in January 2026, so if you install today, you don&#x27;t need a major update for about two years. That&#x27;s plenty of time to try it and see if you like it. If there&#x27;s a critical feature in the upcoming release that you&#x27;d like, RCs are available in advance of release, but IMHO, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that as a matter of course for a new user; sometimes RCs have rough edges and that&#x27;s not a great intro.
