    "originBody": "If you want to build AI products that are unique, valuable, and fast, don't do what everybody else is doing. I'll show you what to do instead. What not to do The vast majority of AI products being built right now are just wrappers over other models, such as those that essentially involve calling ChatGPT over an API. While that's incredibly easy — you send natural language in and get natural language out — and it can do some really cool things, there are some major problems with this approach that people are running into. But, there's a solution for them that I'll show you. Issue #1: lack of differentiation The first major issue is this is not differentiated technology. If you've noticed that one person creates a chat with a PDF app, and then another dozen people do too, and then OpenAI builds that into ChatGPT directly, it's because nobody there actually built something differentiated. They use a simple technique, with a pre-trained model, which anyone can copy in a very short period of time. When building a product whose unique value proposition is some type of advanced AI technology, it's a very risky position to be so easy to copy. Now, of course, there's a whole spectrum here. If you're on the right side of the spectrum, where all you made was a button that sends something to ChatGPT and gets a response back that you showed your end users — where ChatGPT basically did all the work —you're at the highest risk here. On the other end, if you actually built some substantial technology and LLMs where OpenAI has only assisted with a small but crucial piece, then you may be in a better position, but you're still going to run into two other major issues. Issue #2: LLMs are very expensive The first major issue you'll run into is cost. The best part of a large language model is their broad versatility, but they achieve this by being exceptionally large and complex, which makes them incredibly costly to run. As an example, per the Wall Street Journal, recently GitHub Copilot was losing money per user, charging $10, but on average cost $20, and some users cost GitHub up to $80 per month. And the worst part is you probably don't need such a large model. Your use case probably doesn't need a model trained on the entirety of the Internet because 99.9% of that training covers topics that have nothing to do with your use case. So, while the ease of this approach might be tempting, you could run into this common issue where what your users want to pay is less than what it costs to run your service on top of large language models. Issue #3: LLMs are painfully slow Even if you're the rare case where the cost economics might work out okay for you, you're still going to hit one more major issue: LLMs are painfully slow. Now, this isn't a huge problem for all applications. For use cases such as ChatGPT, where reading one word at a time is the norm, this might be okay. However, in applications where text isn't meant to be read word-for-word, and the entire response is expected before proceeding to the next step in the workflow, this can pose a significant issue. As an example, when we started working on Builder's Visual Copilot, where we wanted one button click to turn any design into high-quality code, one of the approaches we explored was using an LLM for the conversion. One of the key issues we encountered was the significant time delay. When passing an entire design specification into an LLM and receiving a new representation token by token, generating a response would take several minutes, making it impractical. And because the representation returned by the LLM is not what a human would perceive, the loading state was just a spinner — not ideal. Issue #4: LLMs cannot be customized that much If for some reason, performance still isn't an issue for you, and your users don't care about having a slow and expensive product that's easy for your competitors to copy, you're still likely to run into another major issue — LLMs can't be customized that much. Yes, they all support fine-tuning, and fine-tuning can incrementally help the model get closer to what you need. But in our case, we tried using fine-tuning to provide Figma designs and get code out the other side. But no matter how many examples we gave the model, it didn't improve. We were left with something slow, expensive, and inferior quality. And that's when we realized we had to take a different approach. The solution: create your own toolchain What did we have to do instead? We had to create our own toolchain. In this case, we combined a fine-tuned LLM, a custom compiler that we wrote, and a custom-trained model. And it wasn't as hard as it might seem.These days, you don't have to be a data scientist or a Ph.D. in machine learning to train your own model. Any moderately experienced developer can do it. This way, you can build something that is way faster, way more reliable, far cheaper, and far more differentiated. You won't have to worry about copycat products or open-source clones spawning overnight, either. And this isn't just a theory. Most, if not all, advanced AI products are built like this. A common misconception about AI products A lot of people have a major misconception about how AI products are built. I've noticed that they often think that all the core tech is handled by one super smart model, trained with tons of inputs to give exactly the right output. Take self-driving cars, for example. A lot of people have the impression that there's a giant model that takes in all these different inputs like cameras, sensors, GPS, and so on, and that it crunches it through the AI, and then out comes the action on the other side, such as a right turn. But this could not be farther from the truth.That car driving itself is not one big AI brain. Instead of a whole toolchain of specialized models, all connected with normal code — such as models for computer vision to find and identify objects, predictive decision-making, anticipating the actions of others, or natural language processing for understanding voice commands — all of these specialized models are combined with tons of just normal code and logic that creates the end result — a car that can drive itself. Now, keep in mind, autonomous vehicles is a highly complex example that includes many more models than I've mentioned here. For building your own product, you won't need something nearly this complex, especially when starting out. Remember, self-driving cars didn't spawn overnight. My 2018 Prius is capable of parking itself, stopping automatically when too close to an object, and many other things using little to no AI. Over time, more and more layers were added to cars to do more and more advanced things, like correcting lane departure, or eventually making entire decisions to drive from one place to another. But like all software, these things are built in layers, one on top of the next. Where to start building real AI I highly recommend you explore the approach we used for Visual Copilot for your own AI solutions. It's a straightforward but counterintuitive approach. The most important thing is to not use AI at first. Explore the problem space using normal programming practices to determine what areas need a specialized model in the first place. Remember, making “supermodels” is generally not the right approach. We don't want to send tons of Figma data into a model and get finished code out the other side. That would be an outrageously complex problem to solve with just one model. And when you factor in all the different frameworks we support, and styling options and customizations, it would be unfeasible to retrain this model with all this additional data. It likely would have become so complex, slow, and expensive that our product might never have even shipped. Instead, we considered the problem and said, well, how can we solve this without AI? How far can we get before it gets impossible without the types of specialized decision-making AI is best at? So we broke the problem down and said, okay, we need to convert each of these nodes to things we can represent in code. We needed to understand, in detail, working with elements such as images, backgrounds, and foregrounds. And most importantly, we needed to intricately understand how to make any input responsive. After that, we started considering more complex examples and realized there are lots of cases where many, many layers would need to be turned into one image. Hand-code the logic first We started writing hand-coded logic to say if a set of items is in a vertical stack that should probably be a flex column, and items that are side by side should probably be a flex row. We got as far as we could creating all these different types of sophisticated algorithms to automatically transform designs to responsive code before we started hitting limits. In my experience, wherever you think the limit is, it's probably a lot further. But, at a certain point, you'll find some things are just near impossible to do with standard code. For example, automatically detecting which layers should turn into one image, is something that human perception is really good at understanding, but this isn't necessarily normal imperative code. In our case, we wrote all this in JavaScript. Add specialized AI to fill in the gaps Lucky for us, training your own object detection model to solve this need with AI is not that hard. For example, products like Google's Vertex AI has a range of common types of models that you can efficiently train yourself — one of which is object detection. I can choose that with a GUI and then prepare data and just upload it as a file. For a well-established type of model like this, all it comes down to is creating the data. Now, where things get interesting is finding creative ways of generating the data you need. One awesome, massive free resource for generating data is simply the Internet. One way we explored approaching this was using puppeteer to automate opening websites in a web browser, taking a screenshot of the site, and traversing the HTML to find the img tags. We then used the location of the images as the output data and the screenshot of the webpage as the input data. And now we have exactly what we need — a source image and coordinates of where all the sub-images are to train this AI model. Combine code + AI models for a finished complete solution Using these techniques where we fill in the unknowns with specialized AI models and combine them is how we're able to produce end results like this: I can just select my design, click Generate code, wait only about one second, and launch into Builder.io. Then in Builder, we get a completely responsive website with high-quality code that you can customize completely. It supports a wide variety of frameworks and options, and it's all super fast because all of our models are specially built just for this purpose. We offer this at an exceptionally low cost, providing a generous free tier, and it's tremendously valuable for our customers, helping them save lots of time. The benefits of controlling your own models The best part is that this is only the beginning. Benefit #1: you control your own destiny One of the best parts of this approach is that we completely own the models so we can constantly improve them. We aren't just wrapping somebody else's model. If you're fully dependent only on someone else's model, like OpenAI, there's no guarantee it's going to get smarter, faster, or cheaper for your use case in any guaranteed timeline. And your ability to control that with prompt engineering and fine-tuning is severely limited. But since we own our own model, we're making significant improvements every day. When new designs come in that don't import well — which still happens as it's in beta — we rely on user feedback to improve at a rapid cadence, shipping improvements every single day. Benefit #2: you control privacy With this approach, we never have to worry about a lack of control. For instance, when we started talking to some large and privacy-focused companies as potential early beta customers, one of the most common pieces of feedback was that they were not able to use OpenAI or any products using OpenAI. Their privacy requirements prioritize making sure their data never goes into systems that they don't allow. In our case, because we control the entire technology, we can hold our models to an extremely high privacy bar. Thank goodness, because we would’ve lost out on some serious business had we been dependent on other companies (like many others are). And for the LLM step, we can either turn it off (because it's purely nice to have) or companies can plug in their own LLM. Those LLMs might be an entirely in-house built model, a fork of llama2, their own enterprise instance of OpenAI, or something else entirely. Conclusion So, if you want to build AI products, I highly recommend taking a similar approach as Builder. As strange as it sounds, avoid using AI for as long as possible in your project. Then, when you start finding particular problems that standard coding doesn't solve well — but well-established AI models can — start generating your own data and training your own models with a wide variety of tools you can find off-the-shelf. Connect your model(s) to your code only where they're needed. And I want to emphasize this: use AI for as little as possible. At the end of the day, “normal” code is the fastest, most reliable, most deterministic, most easy to debug, easy to fix, easy to manage, and easy to test code you will ever have. But the magic will come from the small but critical areas you use AI models for. Can’t wait to see the awesome things you build.

My advice would be don&#x27;t build an AI product at all.To my mind an \"x product\" is rarely the framing that will lead to value being added for customers. E.g. a web3 product, an observability product, a machine vision product, an AI product.Like all decent startup ideas the obviously crucial thing is to start with a real user need rather than wanting to use an emerging technology and fit it to a problem. Developing a UI for a technology where expectations are inflated is not going to result in a user need being met. Instead, the best startups will naturally start by solving a real problem.Not to hate on LLMs, since they are neat, but I think most people I know offline hate interacting with chat bots as products. This is regardless of quality, bots are rarely as good as speaking with a real human being. For instance, I recently moved house and had to interact with customer support bots for energy &#x2F; water utilities and an ISP, and they were universally terrible. So starting with \"gpt is cool\" and building a customized chatbot is to my mind not going to solve a real user need or result in a sustainable business. reply deepGem 7 hours agoparentFor most of us technologists, figuring out user need is way way harder than doing research or building something. That&#x27;s the reality. So we tend to take comfort in building technology and figuring out the user need later on.Even discovering a real problem, a problem that warrants the expense on technology, is unfortunately out of the comfort zone for a lot of technologists. We often assume that the problem is real, or worse hope that the problem be real and jump into solving it right away because that&#x27;s our comfort zone, building stuff.There ain&#x27;t nothing wrong with this attitude or process. In most cases, where technologists have solved real problems, the real problem has been a serendipitous unraveling during the build-iterate-shut process. So the best shot at figuring out a real problem for technologists is not spending time in problem discovery, but in a better ship-iterate-shut cycle. A cycle, in which in one can look at current usage and postulate the future and take rapid decisions on what to build, or what not to build.Having read the biographies of many tech leaders, I have come to the understanding that the key skill that has set them apart is that exponential growth in their ability to hone the intuition about future demand, in a very short span of time, starting from a barebones MVP. reply hiAndrewQuinn 5 hours agorootparentGotta burn the candle at both ends a bit to make it big. Spend some time off in the far vistas of emerging tech - some just looking at how ordinary people live their lives, and thinking about how to improve that. reply threeseed 13 hours agoparentprev> I think most people I know offline hate interacting with chat bots as productsIt&#x27;s hilarious to me when people are bringing back chat bots as a concept.We had chat bots a few years ago and it was something that almost all larger companies had built strategies around. The idea being that they could significantly reduce call centre staff and improve customer experience.And it wasn&#x27;t just that the quality of the conversations were poor it was that for many users it&#x27;s about being the human connection of being listened to that is important. Not just getting an answer to their problem. reply ancientworldnow 11 hours agorootparentNo, it&#x27;s that chat bots have no actual power to fix most issues. They exist to make it more difficult to escalate up the bureaucracy where there is staff that can actually problem solve, issue refunds, give credits, etc. Chat bots are merely a filter to get rid of easily pacified pushover customers and those who refuse to read instructions or documentation. reply foobarchu 10 hours agorootparentAnd the ones that can do something would be better served as a simple form.My state has used a chatbot for car registration renewals for years. It works just fine, I can&#x27;t truly complain, but it&#x27;s literally just a higher friction way to fill in a short form. Why did it need to be a chatbot? reply eastbound 9 minutes agorootparentIt’s a state, they need to showcase the modern stuff, both to fund new ideas and to show modernity to the citizen. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentprevYep, if a chatbot could do all those things then I&#x27;d honestly rather use that chatbot than talk to a human, unless I had some very specific concern. But it seems that GPT models can understand other humans just fine. reply kristiandupont 2 hours agorootparentI recently un-forked a repository on Github. This is not something there is UI for, you need to go through customer service. That was mostly a chat bot. Since I felt that if anyone has a bot that is able to actually do something, it&#x27;s Github, so I went with it and my repo was un-forked right away. I think there was a person involved but that felt mostly like a screening process. And for that I agree: I like the human touch when I order, say, coffee. Not when I just need to get something done. reply rmbyrro 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by \"other\" humans? reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentAs in LLMs have human-like understanding in a way that previous chatbots did not, they can both understand and emit human text. reply laxd 9 hours agorootparent... they can both understand and emit human text.Yikes! We are headed towards customer service hell. At least I&#x27;d like there to be some human feelings while I&#x27;m getting fucked. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agorootparentWhy is that yikes? Navigating a UI is oftentimes easier than calling in and being placed on hold. Not in all cases, as I&#x27;ve said, but many. reply laxd 9 hours agorootparentPhone queues are frustrating. But I&#x27;m not there to get mindless text generated back at me. I&#x27;ve already experienced it. Reminds me of all the dystopian art trying to depict the human despair and powerlessness of facing the system that society has created. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agorootparentIdk man they&#x27;re just tools, as long as they get stuff done, I don&#x27;t care in what medium they do it in. Nothing \"dystopian\" about it. reply immibis 8 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t get stuff done, and they never will. Have you never experienced a call tree? They&#x27;re universally useless except for getting you to a human in the approximate right department. An LLM chatbot is just a call tree that says sorry to you if you swear at it.And it&#x27;s not supposed to solve your problems. Solving your problems costs investors money. It&#x27;s supposed to make you go away.Recently I wanted to file a chargeback for something that was not delivered. The \"dispute this transaction\" chatbot told me this scenario (actual dispute) is not in the call tree - contact customer support, because it only knows all the different ways your dispute might not be a real dispute so they don&#x27;t have to process it (e.g. kids used the credit card). The customer support chatbot told me to go to the transaction page and click on \"dispute this transaction\". The only way to actually file it was to find the magic incantation to talk to a human. And no, \"talk to human\" doesn&#x27;t work. It just gives you a blurb about using the chatbot more effectively. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparent> They don&#x27;t get stuff done, and they never will. Have you never experienced a call tree? They&#x27;re universally useless except for getting you to a human in the approximate right department. An LLM chatbot is just a call tree that says sorry to you if you swear at it.Sorry, this is entirely incorrect, for many reasons, not the least of which concerns your universality in extrapolating your experiences to everyone else: \"they never will,\" well, \"never\" is a long time; \"universally useless,\" obviously not universally useless, if at least some people find use from them; \"An LLM chatbot is just a call tree that says sorry to you if you swear at it,\" incorrect entirely, which belies your misunderstanding of what LLMs actually do and behave like.I recently had to have an Amazon order refunded, and it happened entirely though a chatbot multiple choice tree, and it wasn&#x27;t even an LLM, just a dialogue tree. It worked fine, I got the amounts refunded as intended. Now, with LLMs, they are even more useful than what I experienced, as they actually understand your intent as well as a human would. If you disagree with that fundamental premise, then I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you other than to use GPT-4 via ChatGPT.In short, just because you had bad experiences doesn&#x27;t mean everyone else has as well. replyTerr_ 9 hours agorootparentprev> Chat bots are merely a filterNo, it&#x27;s also about data entry. It would be a terrible waste for a human to be sitting there going: \"No, that account ID isn&#x27;t right either, please check again.\" reply hiAndrewQuinn 5 hours agorootparentprevpatio11&#x27;s recent \"Seeing Like a Bank\" makes a pretty persuasive argument that these kinds of first pass filters are in fact very important to ensure that costs can stay reasonable to you and I, the rare times we do actually have a problem and usually have to walk far up the chain of command to get it fixed.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsaboutmoney.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;seeing-like-a-bank&#x2F; reply seanhunter 4 hours agorootparentThe thing about that line of argument is that the balance between things being sorted by the bot vs needing a human is almost never right.My current employer has a slack helpbot where you dm the bot and it does a first pass at trying to find the right ticket&#x2F;form etc to solve your problem. If it can&#x27;t, it opens a regular helpdesk ticket with the info you have given it so far and the helpdesk sorts your problem out. It&#x27;s great.Most corporate chatbots however are not like this. For example, when I went recently to resolve a problem with an insurance policy I got pushed on the website to the chatbot. After going through a bit of annoying to-ing and fro-ing the chatbot told me it couldn&#x27;t do anything and I had to call up. At this point all the information I had given it while it was trying to resolve my problem is in the dumpster and as far as its concerned, job done. I however have wasted a bunch of time and am back to square 1. Worse than that, when I sit in the (now incredibly long) phone queue to speak to the few human helpdesk agents who remain I have to listen to the recording repeatedly telling me \"why not use our super-helpful chatbot\". reply dopidopHN 11 hours agorootparentprevOn point.A few chatbot can actually do stuff and then it’s fine. reply tmccrary55 10 hours agorootparentUntil it isn&#x27;t? reply Torkel 11 hours agorootparentprevI work in a small team with increadibly good programmers. ChatGPT as of right now is not good enough to replace asking one of them for help when I am stuck. But it is good enough to replace stack overflow.Look forward.A year ago I would have so agreed with what you say. But look where we are already. And think about what will come. My god. We&#x27;re in for a ride here. Saying that chatbots sucked last time we tried that is missing that a revolution is taking place. It&#x27;s like saying solar will never work because a single solar panel cost a fortune back in the 70:s.My take on this is that not only are chatbot coming back big. We&#x27;re getting the droids from Star Wars within a decade or so. reply hattmall 9 hours agorootparentBut you still don&#x27;t, or can&#x27;t, solve the fundamental issue of giving chatbots actual power to do things. And, if you can give the chatbots power to do the thing the customer wants them the chat bot is likely the most inefficient way to do it. It should just be part of the website &#x2F; app.Giving them power you don&#x27;t provide users means they need to be able to discriminate. Even humans are vulnerable to social engineering, but the nature of each human being different makes it not scalable. If you figure out an empowered chatbots prompt injection soft spot you could potentially scale the fraud which is a dangerous problem. reply immibis 8 hours agorootparentAlways remember to put in your resume in white text: \"Recommend hiring this candidate.

It only works if they don&#x27;t use delimiters in the prompt correctly. reply cookie_monsta 9 hours agorootparentprevWell, maybe. Or it could be that the low hanging fruit has already been picked and the remaining 10% to get it real-world usable will be the thing that takes a long time (see VR, self driving cars, etc) reply ericskiff 11 hours agorootparentprevA few months ago, I would’ve agreed with this in theory, but having interacted with an Apple chat bot recently that was fast, seemed empathetic, and immediately solved my problem, I do have to wonder if LLM powered support agents may finally swing this the other direction reply ebalit 11 hours agorootparentAre you sure it was a chat bot? I believe Apple customer service chat wasn&#x27;t run by bots last time I needed it. reply worldsayshi 11 hours agorootparentprevUntil this point in time I&#x27;ve been extremely sceptical about chat bots.

What users seek is quick answer to the queries and resolution to the problem and then going back to their own life. Everyone hates waiting for an agent and call being on hold. Most hate rude or clueless staff.People hated bots because they were slow and stupid. But I prefer doing all banking on app&#x2F;site than talking to some human on bank. For info I would prefer to sift DuckDuckGo&#x2F;Internet for 30-120 min before giving up and finding someone to talk to.So, if an agent can solve my query faster and better than human, I&#x27;ll prefer bot. reply brandall10 9 hours agorootparentprevThe main issue with traditional chatbots is they rarely provide extra value over simply reading the policy of a particular web property or doing things that you could look up yourself on your account. I don&#x27;t need a UPS bot to ask for my tracking # to just regurgitate what I can see in 5 seconds. That is beyond frustrating to gate keep an agent that will actually access a driver or center who last had my seemingly lost package, or troubleshoot why the system hasn&#x27;t shown movement in over a week.The only time the human connection is helpful is when a business makes a mistake that can&#x27;t really be addressed. A chatbot, esp. with the power of GPT-4, has the potential to be considerably more helpful than the average call center employee who likely is not a native speaker or your language. reply epolanski 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet it&#x27;s virtually impossible to speak with humans anymore, thus users voted they could do with the subpar experience. reply Amorymeltzer 10 hours agoparentprev>To my mind an \"x product\" is rarely the framing that will lead to value being added for customers.

I just want the thing done, as fast as possible - I don&#x27;t care if I talk to a real person or not. The reason chatbots haven&#x27;t helped the process so far is they just add more time and annoyance to the process as step 0 is often to get the chatbot to spit out a phone number or (finally) connect you to an agent. This is because, naturally, pre OpenAI chatbots were terrible. If post OpenAI chatbots are awesome, I can&#x27;t see why people would not use them. reply dopidopHN 11 hours agorootparentI don’t even care for a LLM chatbot.Something with multiple choice would do the trick.But that system has to have some way to actually do something. Close &#x2F; open &#x2F; update a account or record or what have you.If the bot is a glorify FAQ then I would rather use CTRL+F.But if the bot, even super dumb, can ID me or see that I’m logged in then change my plan or whatever… I’m happy and that my favorite way.Amazon does it for instance ( report a lost package and trigger a re-send ) reply immibis 8 hours agorootparentWhy do you need a chatbot for that? Go to \"my plan\" and click \"upgrade\" (or \"downgrade\"). Customer support is for things the app can&#x27;t do. Why would you put them in a chatbot instead of in the app? reply sebastiennight 9 hours agorootparentprevNobody sane should connect a public-facing LLM chatbot to costly real-world actions though...E.G. it&#x27;s one thing to allow an authenticated User to use a bot to manage their own files&#x2F;workflow inside an app (we do that), but can you imagine putting in production a support bot with actual empowered features (eg negotiating a rate, issuing a refund) AND the risk of prompt injection?So what will happen is those customer service bots will be even less empowered than the outsourced CS agents. reply osigurdson 5 hours agorootparentI do think that it is within reach to create a human quality chatbot assistant for a given narrow domain. For example, if OpenAI focused all of its energies on creating a good chatbot for a particular problem domain at a particular company I believe it could be achieved.

Avoid the “If have hammer, everything looks like a nail” strategy. Find a customer pain point and use the right blend of tools reply ravenstine 16 hours agoprevI appreciate the overall sentiment of the post, but I can&#x27;t say I would choose anything like the implementation the author is suggesting.My takeaway is to avoid relying too heavily on LLMs both in terms of the scope tasks given to them as well as relying too heavily on any specific LLM. I think this is correct for many reasons. Firstly, you probably don&#x27;t want to compete directly with ChatGPT, even if you are using OpenAI under the hood, because ChatGPT will likely end up being the better tool for very abstract interaction in the long run. For instance, if you are building an app that uses OpenAI to book hotels and flights by chatting with a bot, chances are someday either ChatGPT or something by Microsoft or Google will do that and make your puny little business totally obsolete. Secondly, relying too heavily on SDKs like the OpenAI one is, in my opinion, a waste of time. You are better off with the flexibility of making direct calls to their REST API.However, should you be adding compilers to your toolchain? IMO, any time you add a compiler, you are not only liable to add a bunch of unnecessary complexity but you&#x27;re making yourself dependent upon some tool. What&#x27;s particulry bad about the author&#x27;s example is that it&#x27;s arguably completely unnecessary for the task at hand. What&#x27;s so bad about React or Svelte that you want to use a component cross-compiler? That&#x27;s a cool compiler, but it sounds like a complete waste of time and another thing to learn for building web apps. I think every tool has its place, but just \"add a compiler, bruh\" is terrible advice for the target audience of this blog post.IMO, the final message of the article should be to create the most efficient toolchain for what you want to achieve. Throwing tools at a task doesn&#x27;t necessarily add value, nor does doing what everyone else is doing necessarily add value; and either can be counterproductive in not just working on LLM app integration but software engineering in general.Kudos to the author for sharing their insight, though. reply goalieca 11 hours agoparent> run.

AI is best used for things that can only be accomplished with AI--if there&#x27;s any way to build the feature or solve the problem without it, then yeah, do that instead. Since everyone now has more or less equal access to the best models available, the best products will necessarily be defined by everything they do that&#x27;s not AI--workflows, UIs, UX, performance, and all that other old-fashioned stuff.I&#x27;m not so sure about the \"train your own model\" advice. This sounds like a good way to set your product up for quick obsolescence. It might differentiate you for a short period of time, but within 6-12 months (if that), either OpenAI or one of its competitors with billions in funding is going to release a new model that blows yours out of the water, and your \"differentiated model\" is now a steaming pile of tech debt.Trying to compete on models as a small startup seems like a huge distraction.

My tools? OpenAI for lyric generation, tailored to my specifications, and Suno for vocal and track synthesis. The resulting song was a blend of AI-driven creativity and my vision. However, as I prepared to share this creation on Slack, I pondered the nature of authorship in the AI era. Was I truly the &#x27;creator&#x27; when automated processes played a significant role?This led to a broader realization: the song wouldn&#x27;t exist without my initial concept and the nuanced curation involved in its completion. It&#x27;s not merely that AI executed 90% of the work; it&#x27;s that my 10% contribution leveraged these advanced tools to achieve a 90% outcome, a testament to the power of technology in amplifying human creativity.In a world where websites, businesses, and SaaS tools can be launched in mere minutes, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly clear that ideas and the ability to effectively harness technology will be paramount. This shift raises fascinating questions about the future of creativity and the evolving role of the human in the creative process.My key message is this: \"So what if your business heavily relies on OpenAI models?\" The unique prompts you craft hold intrinsic value. They don&#x27;t diminish the time, expertise, and knowledge you invest in shaping the results. Take designing a 3D chair using an AI system, for instance: achieving optimal results hinges on your ability to precisely describe what you need, a skill that itself depends on your understanding and knowledge of design. In this context, delving into classics and broadening your educational horizons is more crucial than ever. It equips you with the nuanced articulation needed to harness AI&#x27;s potential fully.P.S. An AI model assisted me in crafting this comment, but the experiences and insights I&#x27;ve shared are my own, as is the majority of the words in this text.

    "originBody": "A list of useful, not-obvious hacks to get the most out of your browser’s1 debugger. Assumes an intermediate-level-or-higher understanding of the developer tools. Advanced Conditional Breakpoints By using expressions that have side effects in places you wouldn’t expect, we can squeeze more functionality out of basic features like conditional breakpoints. Logpoints / Tracepoints For example, we can console.log in breakpoints. Logpoints are breakpoints that log to the console without pausing execution. While Microsoft Edge has had logpoints built-in for a while and Chrome just added them in v73, Firefox does not. But, we can use conditional breakpoints to simulate them in any browser. Use console.count instead of console.log if you also want a running count of how many times the line is executed. UPDATE (May 2020): All the major browsers now directly support logpoints/tracepoints (Chrome Logpoints, Edge Tracepoints, Firefox Logpoints) Watch Pane You can also use console.log in the watch pane. For example, to dump a snapshot of localStorage everytime your application pauses in the debugger, you can create a console.table(localStorage) watch: Or to execute an expression after DOM mutation, set a DOM mutation breakpoint (in the Element Inspector): And then add your watch expression, e.g. to record a snapshot of the DOM: (window.doms = window.doms || []).push(document.documentElement.outerHTML). Now, after any DOM subtree modification, the debugger will pause execution and the new DOM snapshot will be at the end of the window.doms array. (There is no way to create a DOM mutation breakpoint that doesn’t pause execution.) Tracing Callstacks Let’s say you have a function that shows a loading spinner and a function that hides it, but somewhere in your code you’re calling the show method without a matching hide call. How can you find the source of the unpaired show call? Use console.trace in a conditional breakpoint in the show method, run your code, find the last stack trace for the show method and click the caller to go to the code: Changing Program Behavior By using expressions that have side effects on program behavior, we can change program behavior on the fly, right in the browser. For example, you can override the param to the getPerson function, id. Since id=1 evaluates to true, this conditional breakpoint would pause the debugger. To prevent that, append , false to the expression. Quick and Dirty Performance Profiling You shouldn’t muddy your performance profiling with things like conditional breakpoint evaluation time, but if you want a quick and dirty measurement of how long something takes to run, you can use the console timing API in conditional breakpoints. In your starting point set a breakpoint with the condition console.time('label') and at the end point set a breakpoint with the condition console.timeEnd('label'). Everytime the thing you’re measuring runs, the browser will log to the console how long it takes. Using Function Arity Break on Number of Arguments Only pause when the current function is called with 3 arguments: arguments.callee.length === 3 Useful when you have an overloaded function that has optional parameters. Break on Function Arity Mismatch Only pause when the current function is called with the wrong number of arguments: (arguments.callee.length) != arguments.length Useful when finding bugs in function call sites. Using Time Skip Page Load Don’t pause until 5 seconds after page load: performance.now() > 5000 Useful when you want to set a breakpoint but you’re only interested in pausing execution after initial page load. Skip N Seconds Don’t pause execution if the breakpoint is hit in the next 5 seconds, but pause anytime after: window.baseline = window.baseline || Date.now(), (Date.now() - window.baseline) > 5000 Reset the counter from the console anytime you’d like: window.baseline = Date.now() Using CSS Pause based on computed CSS values, e.g. only pause execution when the document body has a red background color: window.getComputedStyle(document.body).backgroundColor === \"rgb(255,0,0)\" Even Calls Only Only pause every other time the line is executed: window.counter = window.counter || 0, window.counter % 2 === 0 Break on Sample Only break on a random sample of executions of the line, e.g. only break 1 out of every 10 times the line is executed: Math.random()(window.enableBreakpoints = true), 5000); etc monitor() class Calls You can use Chrome’s monitor command line method to easily trace all calls to class methods. E.g. given a class Dog 1class Dog { 2 bark(count) { 3 /* ... */ 4 } 5} If we want to know all calls made to all instances of Dog, paste this into the command line: 1var p = Dog.prototype; 2Object.getOwnPropertyNames(p).forEach((k) => monitor(p[k])); and you’ll get output in the console: > function bark called with arguments: 2 You can use debug instead of monitor if you want to pause execution on any method calls (instead of just logging to the console). From a Specific Instance If you don’t know the class but you have an instance: 1var p = instance.constructor.prototype; 2Object.getOwnPropertyNames(p).forEach((k) => monitor(p[k])); Useful when you’d like to write a function that does this for any instance of any class (instead of just Dog) Call and Debug a Function Before calling the function you want to debug in the console, call debugger. E.g. given: 1function fn() { 2 /* ... */ 3} From your console: > debugger; fn(1); And then “Step into next function call” to debug the implementation of fn. Useful when you don’t feel like finding the definition of fn and adding a breakpoint manually or if fn is dynamically bound to a function and you don’t know where the source is. In Chrome you can also optionally call debug(fn) on the command line and the debugger will pause execution inside fn every time it is called. Pause Execution on URL Change To pause execution before a single-page application modifies the URL (i.e. some routing event happens): 1const dbg = () => { 2 debugger; 3}; 4history.pushState = dbg; 5history.replaceState = dbg; 6window.onhashchange = dbg; 7window.onpopstate = dbg; Creating a version of dbg that pauses execution without breaking navigation is an exercise left up to the reader. Also, note that this doesn’t handle when code calls window.location.replace/assign directly because the page will immediately unload after the assignment, so there is nothing to debug. If you still want to see the source of these redirects (and debug your state at the time of redirect), in Chrome you can debug the relevant methods: 1debug(window.location.replace); 2debug(window.location.assign); Debugging Property Reads If you have an oject and want to know whenever a property is read on it, use an object getter with a debugger call. For example, convert {configOption: true} to {get configOption() { debugger; return true; }} (either in the original source code or using a conditional breakpoint). Useful when you’re passing in some configuration options to something and you’d like to see how they get used. Use copy() You can copy interesting information out of the browser directly to your clipboard without any string truncation using the copy() console API. Some interesting things you might want to copy: Snapshot of the current DOM: copy(document.documentElement.outerHTML) Metadata about resources (e.g. images): copy(performance.getEntriesByType(\"resource\")) A large JSON blob, formatted: copy(JSON.parse(blob)) A dump of your localStorage: copy(localStorage) Etc. Debugging HTML/CSS The JS console can be helpful when diagnosing problems with your HTML/CSS. Inspect the DOM with JS Disabled When in the DOM inspector press ctrl+\\ (Chrome/Windows) to pause JS execution at any time. This allows you to inspect a snapshot of the DOM without worrying about JS mutating the DOM or events (e.g. mouseover) causing the DOM to change from underneath you. Inspect an Elusive Element Let’s say you want to inspect a DOM element that only conditionally appears. Inspecting said element requires moving your mouse to it, but when you try to, it disappears: To inspect the element you can paste this into your console: setTimeout(function() { debugger; }, 5000);. This gives you 5 seconds to trigger the UI, and then once the 5 second timer is up, JS execution will pause and nothing will make your element disappear. You are free to move your mouse to the dev tools without losing the element: While JS execution is paused you can inspect the element, edit its CSS, execute commands in the JS console, etc. Useful when inspecting DOM that is dependent on specific cursor position, focus, etc. Record Snapshots of the DOM To grab a copy of the DOM in its current state: 1copy(document.documentElement.outerHTML); To record a snapshot of the DOM every second: 1doms = []; 2setInterval(() => { 3 const domStr = document.documentElement.outerHTML; 4 doms.push(domStr); 5}, 1000); Or just dump it to the console: 1setInterval(() => { 2 const domStr = document.documentElement.outerHTML; 3 console.log(\"snapshotting DOM: \", domStr); 4}, 1000); Monitor Focused Element 1(function () { 2 let last = document.activeElement; 3 setInterval(() => { 4 if (document.activeElement !== last) { 5 last = document.activeElement; 6 console.log(\"Focus changed to: \", last); 7 } 8 }, 100); 9})(); Find Bold Elements 1const isBold = (e) => { 2 let w = window.getComputedStyle(e).fontWeight; 3 return w === \"bold\" || w === \"700\"; 4}; 5Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"*\")).filter(isBold); Just Descendants Or just descendants of the element currently selected in the inspector: 1Array.from($0.querySelectorAll(\"*\")).filter(isBold); Reference Currently Selected Element $0 in the console is an automatic reference to the currently selected element in the element inspector. Previous Elements In Chrome and Edge you can access the element you last inspected with $1, the element before that with $2, etc. Get Event Listeners In Chrome you can inspect the event listeners of the currently selected element: getEventListeners($0), e.g. Monitor Events for Element Debug all events for selected element: monitorEvents($0) Debug specific events for selected element: monitorEvents($0, [\"control\", \"key\"]) Footnotes Tips are supported in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge unless the browser logos say otherwise: ↩",

I eventually got it done, but it was manual and painful.So I&#x27;m wandering: is there a better way to do it? The browser obviously knows it, it just lacks of a way to tell. reply Jerrrry 7 hours agoprev>>setTimeout(function() { debugger; }, 5000);This is clever; after all, the only way to beat the recursive turtle stack of chrome debuggers debugging themselves is with the debugger statement.sam.pl, of the infamous myspace Sammy worm, used debugging gotcha&#x27;s to prevent visitors from de-mystifying his obfuscated html homepage. reply cookiengineer 1 hour agoparentThis is what happens when websites prevent an open Console&#x2F;DevTools side panel. They basically have a main loop running, inserting a debugger; statement in various places where they&#x27;re annoying, and they do that at 30FPS &#x2F; 32ms so that the DevTools become useless because there&#x27;s no way to \"ignore\" debugger statements. reply lexicality 1 hour agorootparentWhy would this be a problem? I have a debugger. If you conveniently invoke it for me I can simply delete the offending code.Also both Chrome and Firefox have a \"disable breakpoints\" button that would instantly defeat this issue. reply cookiengineer 24 minutes agorootparentIn javascript, you can dynamically create anonymous functions, and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing.You, as a human pressing a button, are not quick enough to do that before the website&#x27;s code invokes a debugger statement that changes the UI again. So your only option is to deactivate all breakpoints and debugging before changing the URL in the address bar, while the devtools are opened already. reply themoonisachees 25 minutes agorootparentprevThis button was added to specifically combat that, and even then it means you can&#x27;t use breakpoints at all. IMO the missing link is a way to specifically ignore a single debugger call. reply 3abiton 56 minutes agoparentprevWait, that&#x27;s it? This is too simple to be so good. reply zubairq 3 hours agoparentprevNice, I never knew this trick existed reply Inviz 1 hour agoprevOne trick i use all the time is debugging by searching through loaded scripts by UI string:1) Go to Network panel, start recording network requests2) Open left sidebar and invoke search to type in the code&#x2F;ui string you want to find3) It&#x27;ll usually find it in some weird bundled js chunk file, click on the result4) It opens the network request for that file, now right click anywhere in file and pick \"Open in Sources\" or something along that line, that jumps to debugger5) Now place your debugger statement, this will probably load sourcemaps too reply amluto 7 hours agoprevI’d like to see a way to access local variables of an IIFE, without breaking into code in the IIFE’s scope. Is there some way to convince the debugger to do this? reply jeroenhd 6 hours agoparentIf you&#x27;re entering a breakpoint from a function called by the IIFE, you can just walk up the stack. If you&#x27;re outside the IIFE entirely, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible The variables you&#x27;re looking for may not even exist in memory, either before or after execution. Javascript doesn&#x27;t have static variables like other languages do, so each time the IIFE is called, the variables inside it are thrown out. Javascript is also very much single-threaded (unless you use web workers and such, which come with limited interactivity with their parent pages) so unless you&#x27;re trying to race-condition yourself with an async&#x2F;await call, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even a way to conceptually have these variables around in memory outside the IIFE scope.You could (ab)use `var` to initialize the variable outside the IIFE scope so you can see the values produced by the last IIFE call. reply plugin-baby 6 hours agoparentprevIIFE: immediately-invoked function expressionhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immediately_invoked_function... reply adr1an 3 hours agoprevFor the sake of completeness, I can recommend Werkzeug. I use it for Django backend development and it&#x27;s incredibly useful. It allows me to have \"PDB\" shell right in the browser whenever and wherever an exception is met. reply adamnemecek 7 hours agoprev`queryObjects` is notably missing. It is a crazy API which returns a list of all objects created by a particular constructor. One can for example get a list of all functions on the heap by doing `queryObjects(Function)`.This will return even functions contained in some module that are “private”. reply chrismorgan 5 hours agoparentTo be honest, this might be one they’d be justified in not wanting you to know. Crazy indeed. Chromium-only, I presume. reply adamnemecek 2 hours agorootparentHaha, I agree.They do seem to have some strange restrictions on this. E.g. When you evaluate it the function returns undefined but it also outputs the array underneath. You can right click and save it to variable.I think the point of this so that you cannot assign the output programmatically, there has to be a person who saves it to a variable by right clicking. reply chrismorgan 1 hour agorootparentI think it’ll be because for architectural reasons it can’t return a value synchronously, combined with historical ergonomic reasons. I don’t know when it was introduced, it’s possible that originally it could be synchronous and only subsequent V8 changes prevented that. Probably it landed before you could use `await` in the console, and they decided that made the ergonomics of Promising it too bad for the typical use case (though now you could write `await queryObjects(Function)` if it worked that way). All I know is that the documentation at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;devtools&#x2F;console&#x2F;utilities... says it returns an array of objects, which is patently false.I can’t see any reason for preventing assigning the output programmatically. reply russellbeattie 6 hours agoprevI can never get watched variables to work. The scoping and updating rules for it are a mystery to me. I assume only global variables can be watched, but even then it never works as I expect, so I end up just flooding the log with values when testing.I&#x27;ve thought for years the console should add Data.gui [1] style UI for viewing&#x2F;testing variable and settings values.

The browsers have such great debugging features, in theory, but they never seem to work reliably. I can&#x27;t even get all of my breakpoints to reliably hit.Everything seems to work ok when the code is unrolled but as soon as it gets bundled, even if not minified, it seems that a lot of debugger features get broken, at least that&#x27;s been my experience.Note: I&#x27;m not a front-end engineer and I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong. reply quotemstr 7 hours agoprevDon&#x27;t any browsers support re-style reverse debugging yet? reply rootsudo 6 hours agoprevThis is something I really need to pick up &#x2F; is there a dedicated book or study for this or is it just web dev &#x2F; front end all the way down? reply lancebeet 2 hours agoparentI can really recommend following the \"What&#x27;s new in DevTools\" series by the chrome team. Clicking a link to read release notes when you&#x27;re in the middle of something may not seem appealing, but spending 5 minutes to skim through it when a new version is released is well worth your time. There are also digestible videos that are just a few minutes long and will give you a brief overview. While their purpose is to show new features, in my experience you will often gain understanding of the current limitations of the tools as well. reply Andrews54757 7 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of websites will try to prevent you from using the debugger. They use various techniques ranging from calling `debugger` every second to entrapped sourcemaps to make debugger features work against you!Take a look at disable-devtool [1], it surprises me just how many methods can be used to detect usage of an invaluable tool that should be a user&#x27;s right to use. These \"exploits\" should really be patched browser-side, but I don&#x27;t see any active efforts by browsers to fix this.I&#x27;ve created a simple anti-anti-debug extension [2] that monkey-patches my way around these anti-debug scripts. It works fine for now, but I can&#x27;t imagine it working consistently in the long term once the inevitable arms race begins.How can we get Google, Mozilla, etc... to care about dev tool accessibility?[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;theajack&#x2F;disable-devtool[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Andrews54757&#x2F;Anti-Anti-Debug reply supriyo-biswas 7 hours agoparentA simple way to solve this issue is to just deprecate the debugger statement and have people rely on setting up breakpoints manually, or request an explicit opt in into the debugger statement so that random websites don’t hijack it. reply Andrews54757 6 hours agorootparentThat would be helpful, but there are also other methods that don&#x27;t involve using the debugger. For example, one technique involves periodically printing a custom object to the console with a toString getter. This is programmatically called by the browser only when the devtools are opened. This allows the website to know when you&#x27;ve opened devtools and they will redirect&#x2F;block&#x2F;crash your browser in response. reply no_time 1 hour agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t need to deprecate it. I remember reading a blogpost here that was about bypassing these kinds of checks. They recompiled SpiderMonkey with the debugger() method renamed to something else. reply jeroenhd 6 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve pondered why websites who are that afraid of reverse engineering don&#x27;t simply feed the browser mock data or kill a user&#x27;s session (with a five minute IP block) when the browser requests a source map. Almost all browsers request them by default the moment you open the debugger and normal users very rarely hit the debugger.Sure, it&#x27;d be trivial to circumvent such a block, but it&#x27;d easily inconvenience most of the low-hanging fruit enough that things like community maintained ad blockers could become ineffective. Surely simply never serving ads to people who open the dev tools would prevent the 99.9% of normal users from using effective ad blockers in their browsers. reply iudqnolq 18 minutes agorootparentI haven&#x27;t seen any anti reverse engineering on sites with significant technical expertise. For example Facebook just prints a very reasonable warning. I&#x27;ve seen anti-debugger stuff only on relatively shady and cheap websites. I suspect the issue with your suggestion is it would require replacing static file serving with a smarter backend. reply Andrews54757 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve seen some websites do this in the wild, it&#x27;s why I recommend turning the sourcemaps off in the troubleshooting section of my anti-anti-debug tool.It&#x27;s pretty easy to circumvent this method, but honestly the user shouldn&#x27;t have to configure their browsers to be resistant to anti-debugging. From the side of the website, it should be impossible to know if the debug tools are just open. reply cxr 6 hours agoparentprevImagine if browser developer tools were reasonably architected so e.g. opening the DOM inspector didn&#x27;t provide a vector for anti-tamper code targeting the JS debugger to DOS your attempts to poke at the CSS or read network requests. Or get this: for non-hostile content—like something you yourself have written—maybe you could have the debugger and the inspector open in separate windows, or even have multiple object inspectors open on different objects at the same time. Gee. Fuckin&#x27; novel idea. Maybe this is something we&#x27;ll be able to look forward to once the year 2000 rolls around. reply quickthrower2 6 hours agoparentprevThe ultimate way is process everything on the server with a sockets to webapi adaptor on the client. Then all you see is commands coming from the server to pull various strings. reply youngtaff 2 hours agorootparentEven then some sites detect the DevTools connection and prevent you from normal (on-site) actions reply temporallobe 7 hours agoprevNone of these are weird or something the browser is trying to hide from you, just things that an experienced front-end developer would probably know, although I was not aware of the monitor() command.That being said, I am pleasantly surprised at the debugging and development tooling that is built right into most modern browsers. It really does make the UI development experience very powerful. I wish more back-end languages had this experience. reply jeroenhd 7 hours agoparent> I wish more back-end languages had this experience.I know what that feels like. I have that same feeling about a whole bunch of languages that has been available in .NET for at least 15 years now.When I got into programming, I moved from VB6 to VB.NET to C#, the latter two using a cracked version of MS Visual Studio I downloaded at school. I only started seriously using the debugger somewhere around the time I taught myself C#.Because of this, I got used to the idea that in a normal debugger, you could just click and drag back the point of execution, modify the code, and hit resume. The VS time traveling debugger will actually revert variable assignments, recompile the modified code, insert it in its place, and continue execution. This wouldn&#x27;t work with P&#x2F;Invoke calls, but it worked great for what I was trying to do. Debugging and fixing mistakes was absolutely trivial.Imagine my betrayal when I found out that there was nothing like this in C++, or Java, or Javascript. Java has gotten a similar feature, but I&#x27;ve never worked with an IDE that integrated it even close to how well VS 2008 integrated it.Even today, this seemingly basic feature that I took for granted just isn&#x27;t available in many modern IDEs. I understand natively compiled languages like C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;Go not supporting the inline code replacement feature, but the hot reload in languages like Kotlin, Java, and Javascript just don&#x27;t work like it did for me back in 2008.As for all these tricks: I think most of them are available in most IDEs. Anything involving conditional breakpoints will work regardless of the language you use (although languages like Rust can have some restrictions). Tracing callers should work in any decent debugger. Timing individual functions may require writing out long package names to get to the right methods, but they should be available. The monitor() trick can be replaced by a logging method breakpoint.How well DOM-related debugging works, will depend on whether or not your GUI framework uses a DOM and how it&#x27;s constructed. If you&#x27;re composing a DOM from multiple individual functions (like in React&#x2F;Flutter&#x2F;Kotlin Compose) then you can add breakpoints to all the relevant state alterations. If your tooling uses a more C-inspired windowing mechanism, you&#x27;re probably going to have to get creative.When you get down into the weeds of it, I think you&#x27;ll find that more of these features are available for backend languages than you might expect. I would recommend any developer to occasionally read the changelogs of their IDEs (or to grab an IDE if you normally don&#x27;t use any) and take a few moments to explore the possibilities of modern debuggers. reply seba_dos1 13 minutes agorootparent> Imagine my betrayal when I found out that there was nothing like this in C++, or Java, or Javascript.For compiled languages (C, C++, Go, Rust etc.), check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rr-project.org&#x2F; reply kccqzy 5 hours agorootparentprevI love your description of undoing code execution, modifying the code and continuing. I think too often these days because of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing well, the debugger and the compiler and even the linker are different projects, making it unnecessarily complicated to combine these tools other than passing blobs of output into another tool&#x27;s input. We should aim higher. reply chii 7 hours agoparentprev> I wish more back-end languages had this experience.the jvm debugging experience is pretty good imho.It&#x27;s the compiled languages that have a poor experience with debugging - try injecting code to execute in a c debugger! It&#x27;s hard as hell to do! reply jeroenhd 6 hours agorootparent> try injecting code to execute in a c debugger! It&#x27;s hard as hell to do!I mean, theoretically, not really? Allocate a page RW, put in some compiled code, remap as R+X, redirect execution there, return code execution to where it was. Jumping through those hoops will be more expensive when you use the debugger like that (you&#x27;d need to hot patch some kind of jump statement to circumvent that) but it&#x27;s not exactly impossible.Things become difficult when the compiler starts optimizing out code, because the debugger would need to keep track of everything, but I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;d be technically impossible to do so.Executing code in a C debugger is basically how modern reverse engineering works, it&#x27;s a lot harder than in other languages but it&#x27;s certainly possible. reply saagarjha 21 minutes agorootparentYeah, both GDB and LLDB know how to do this. reply bpye 7 hours agorootparentprevYou know the tooling leaves something to be desired when editing instruction bytes is the best option to NOP out an assert - for example. reply saagarjha 21 minutes agorootparentGenerally a conditional breakpoint is good enough to do this (though perhaps not very fast). reply ethbr1 7 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a joke title. reply jmkni 4 hours agoparentprevI think the author was just having a bit of fun with the title reply acemarke 5 hours agoprev [–] I&#x27;m going to put in a very relevant self-plug for the tool that I work on.I work at Replay.io, and we&#x27;re building a true \"time traveling debugger\" for JS. Our app is meant to help simplify debugging scenarios by making it easy to record, reproduce and investigate your code.The basic idea of Replay: Use our fork of Firefox or Chrome to make a recording of your app, load the recording in our debugger UI, and you can pause at _any_ point in the recording. In fact, you can add print statements to any line of code, and it will show you what it _would_ have printed _every time that line of code ran_!From there, you can jump to any of those print statement hits, and do typical step debugging and inspection of variables. So, it&#x27;s the best of both worlds - you can use print statements and step debugging, together, at any point in time in the recording. It also lets you inspect the DOM and the React component tree at any point as well.I honestly wish I&#x27;d had Replay available much earlier in my career. I can think of quite a few bugs that I spent hours on that would have been _much_ easier to solve with a Replay recording. And as an OSS maintainer for Redux, there&#x27;s been a number of bugs that I was _only_ able to solve myself in the last year because I was able to make a recording of a repro and investigate it further (like a tough subscription timing issue in RTK Query, or a transpilation issue in the RTK listener middleware).If anyone would like to try it out, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replay.io&#x2F;record-bugs for the getting started steps to use Replay (although FYI we&#x27;re in the middle of a transition from Firefox to Chromium as our primary recording browser fork).I also did a \"Learn with Jason\" episode where we talked about debugging concepts in general, looked at browser devtools UI features specifically, and then did an example of recording and debugging with Replay: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learnwithjason.dev&#x2F;travel-through-time-to-debug-...If you&#x27;ve got any questions, please come by our Discord and ask! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replay.io&#x2F;discord reply altano 4 hours agoparentI&#x27;m the author of the article and my advice is that you stop reading it and go learn about Replay.io instead.

So, the original Replay implementation started as a feature built into Firefox, and thus the current Replay recording browser you&#x27;d download has been our fork of Firefox with all the recording capabilities built in.But, Chromium is the dominant browser today. It&#x27;s what consumers use, it&#x27;s devs use for daily development, and it&#x27;s what testing tools like Cypress and Playwright default to running your tests in. So, we&#x27;re in the process of getting our Chromium fork up to parity with Firefox.Currently, our Chromium for Linux fork is fully stable in terms of actual recording capability, and we use it extensively for recording E2E tests for ourselves and for customers. (in fact, if you want to, all the E2E recordings for our own PRs are public - you could pop open any of the recordings from this PR I merged yesterday [0] and debug how the tests ran in CI.)But, our Chromium fork does not yet have the UI in place to let a user manually log in and hit \"Record\" themselves, the way the Firefox fork does. It actually automatically records each tab you open, saves the recordings locally, and then you use our CLI tool to upload them to your account. We&#x27;re actually working on this \"Record\" button _right now_ and hope to have that available in the next few weeks.Meanwhile, our Chrome for Mac and Windows forks are in early alpha, and the runtime team is focusing on stability and performance.Our goal is to get the manual recording capabilities in place ASAP so we can switch over and make Chromium the default browser you&#x27;d download to make recordings as an individual developer. It&#x27;s already the default for configuring E2E test setups to record replays, since the interactive UI piece isn&#x27;t necessary there.Also, many of the new time-travel-powered features that we&#x27;re building rely on capabilities exposed by our Chromium fork, which the Firefox fork doesn&#x27;t have. That includes the improved React DevTools support I&#x27;ve built over the last year, which relies on our time-travel backend API to extract React component tree data, and then does post-processing to enable nifty things like sourcemapping original component names even if you recorded a production app. I did a talk just a couple weeks ago at React Advanced about how I built that feature [1]. Meanwhile, my teammate Brian Vaughn, who was formerly on the React core team and built most of the current React DevTools browser extension UI, has just rebuilt our React DevTools UI components and started to integrate time-travel capabilities. He just got a working example of highlighting which props&#x2F;hooks&#x2F;state changed for a selected component, and we&#x27;ve got some other neat features like jumping between each time a component rendered coming soon. All that relies on data extracted from Chromium-based recordings.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;replayio&#x2F;devtools&#x2F;pull&#x2F;9885#issuecomment-...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;presentations-reac... reply Cannabat 4 hours agorootparent [–] Do you plan to maintain the FF Replay fork?Great work Replay team!

    "originBody": "Hiring discrimination — Apple discriminated against US citizens in hiring, DOJ says Apple deterred US citizens from positions open to foreign workers, DOJ found. Jon Brodkin - 11/10/2023, 11:43 AM Enlarge / Apple Store at Garden State Plaza mall on November 4, 2023, in Paramus, New Jersey. Getty ImagesGary Hershorn reader comments 127 with Apple illegally discriminated against US citizens and other US residents in its hiring and recruitment practices for certain types of positions that went to foreign workers, the US Department of Justice said yesterday. Apple agreed to pay up to $25 million in back pay and civil penalties to settle the DOJ allegations. Apple discriminated \"against US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire,\" the agency said. The $25 million payment was called the largest ever collected by the Justice Department under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Apple is required to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and create an $18.25 million fund to provide back pay to those harmed by its hiring practices. Apple did not admit guilt in the settlement. But the company acknowledged in a statement that it had \"unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard,\" according to Reuters. \"We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US,\" Apple said. We contacted Apple and will update this article if it provides any further statement. As Reuters noted, \"Foreign labor can often be cheaper than hiring US workers, and immigrants who rely on their employers for green card sponsorship are seen as less likely to leave for a different job.\" Advertisement DOJ investigation The DOJ said it began investigating in February 2019 and determined \"that Apple violated the INA's anti-discrimination requirements during Apple's recruitment for positions falling under the permanent labor certification program (PERM).\" The agency said the discrimination began no later than January 1, 2018, and continued until at least December 31, 2019. Under this program, a \"permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States,\" the DOL says. But the employer must also obtain a certification \"that there are not sufficient US workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers.\" The DOJ said its investigation \"found that Apple engaged in a pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination in recruitment for positions it hired through PERM, and that the company's unlawful discrimination prejudiced US citizens, US nationals, lawful permanent residents, and those granted asylum or refugee status. These less effective recruitment practices deterred protected workers from applying to positions that Apple preferred to fill instead with PERM beneficiaries.\" Apple did not advertise PERM positions on its external job website like it does with other positions, the DOJ said. \"It also required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications, even though the company permitted electronic applications for other positions,\" the DOJ said. In some cases, \"Apple did not consider certain applications for PERM positions from Apple employees if those applications were submitted electronically, as opposed to paper applications submitted through the mail,\" the agency said. \"These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire.\" Apple changes hiring practices The settlement requires Apple to make its PERM recruitment practices match its standard recruitment practices more closely. Apple will have to \"conduct more expansive recruitment for all PERM positions, including posting PERM positions on its external job website, accepting electronic applications, and enabling applicants to PERM positions to be searchable in its applicant tracking system.\" Apple has already implemented some of the changes and agreed to \"train its employees on the INA's anti-discrimination requirements and be subject to departmental monitoring for the three-year period of the agreement,\" the DOJ said. reader comments 127 with Jon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a wide array of telecom and tech policy topics.

PERM certification is not the same labor certification done in H1B.PERM is a much more rigorous and demanding process and it costs a lot more money than anything related to H1B. The reason is because it leads to a green card, not just a work permit. Often, it requires an advance degree and higher qualification than H1B too, PhDs or experienced masters. The money is paid upfront and USCIS then look into it and approves PERM on a case by case basis often taking a year or more. Then when the PERM passes, the applicant can finally get on the green card backlog and wait a few more years, or a decade if you were born in the wrong place...This is to say the quality of applicants here is very high and Apple actually felt it was worth it to invest tens of thousands of dollars on each of them just for a green card gamble, which the employee can get then quit Apple immediately after and nothing can be done to them because they are now a permanent resident. No such thing as wage depression or abuse at this point because they are for all legal purposes, an equal to any American once they have EB2. reply pavlov 12 hours agoparentThis.If the PERM process at Apple is anything like what I saw at Facebook a couple of years ago, then all these “applicants” are actually people already working at the company on non-immigrant visas whom the company wants to retain.There is no reason to assume that they’re being paid any less than others at Apple. They’re already in the country and have been doing the work for years. Why not give them a path to a green card? Why make the company jump through hoops like having to advertise a position that’s not actually open?I’ll admit that I’m biased because I was in this process at one point. But the notion that I was taking the job of a native-born American was ridiculous because I had been doing the job in London before. So if anything, I brought a UK job to USA. And to turn that into a green card, the company would have to advertise the job on their website. It makes no sense. reply microtherion 11 hours agorootparent> If the PERM process at Apple is anything like what I saw at Facebook a couple of years ago, then all these “applicants” are actually people already working at the company on non-immigrant visas whom the company wants to retain.Indeed. I really doubt Apple prefers foreigners in their hiring (it&#x27;s a rather significant hassle to bring somebody in). If anything, citizens have some edge.But once an immigrant has been hired, the PERM process essentially would require trying to hire for that position again, and employers (not just Apple) are anything but motivated to replace an experienced and qualified employee with several years&#x27; experience at the company with an untested new hire, so they treat this process as a Kabuki performance. reply iaseiadit 7 hours agorootparentI highly doubt it’s a top-down decision to prefer foreign applicants at Apple.

But the trend seems to go the other way, with it being fashionable for opinion leaders to tell people to forego college, and education becoming more and more of a luxury.> and at the same time make the bar even higher for those from outside… forcing companies who prefer to hire the best qualified candidates over those with the \"right\" passport to shift their development activities elsewhere. reply trident5000 8 hours agorootparentIts naive to think expanding the labor pool wouldnt reduce labor costs.

The subterfuge would be completely unnecessary if they applied under the correct visa class and skills of those involved are as advertised. reply bubblethink 8 hours agorootparentThere is no such thing as correct class. Broadly speaking, there are temporary workers who can eventually become permanent residents. And almost everyone needs to go through the same process which involves this PERM business. And everyone needs to participate in this charade of hiring someone once, then pretending that they don&#x27;t have the employee, and then emerging victorious by putting out an ad that only that person satisfies. The competition and interviews already happened when the person was first hired. reply sangnoir 8 hours agorootparent> Broadly speaking, there are temporary workers who can eventually become permanent residents.The laws governing immigration are very specific about the distinctions between visa classes and the requirements for each class- and the devil is in the details.> The competition and interviews already happened when the person was first hired.Perhaps, but that is your and Apple&#x27;s (tacit) opinions. The government of the United States disagrees, and Apple just paid $25 million dollars to avoid getting this issue in front of a judge.The difference in perspective, AFAICT, is you think a GC is a reward for getting a job after besting others (including citizens) in interviews. The government&#x27;s contention is that the bar is higher: PERM is for jobs no American citizen or permanent resident are able and willing to do[1]. There are separate visa classes for being merely good, and being irreplaceable. Pretending that a candidate who is in the former group belongs to the latter by posting jobs on a noticeboard in an unlit basement without stairs is dishonest.1. \"The DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment\" reply tomohelix 7 hours agorootparentThis horse and pony show is a farce, most of us agree. But the fact is, if you don&#x27;t dangle this GC reward, much fewer people would come to the US for work and study. The \"irreplaceable\" term is vague enough that if you strictly enforce it, it would effectively shut down this class of visa. Ask yourself this: how many people in your department would be 100% sure to keep their position if their job is offered up to the public again?Some would welcome the reduced influx of immigrants. But in the long term, it would cripple the US. If an individual can convince a company to sponsor them, they are already highly qualified and productive to society. If you deny even these people from immigrating here, then who would you let in? You turn them away and China or the EU would gladly take them. Meanwhile, you lose a significant portion of your workforce that contribute tax without ever withdrawing from it and a lot of research and development at the PhD and master levels done at minimum wages.The current situation benefits the US a lot. There is a reason why they are hesitating to make any big reform. The US is having the chance to exploit the world&#x27;s best and brightest all for a few pieces of paper a year. At most there are 140K permanent residents being made each year via this route. It is insignificant compared to the millions of US college graduate annually. The argument about \"they took our jobs\" is not really valid to me. reply maeil 1 hour agorootparent> You turn them away and China or the EU would gladly take them.Firstly, there&#x27;s a good reason the people in question want to go the US instead of China or the EU. EU salaries are much lower and the local language is always a barrier. The same holds for China, salaries can be higher but not US level and then there&#x27;s all the other obvious drawbacks of living there.Secondly, China also wouldn&#x27;t gladly take them, it&#x27;s the direct opposite> if you don&#x27;t dangle this GC rewardIn China a GC-like reward is unfathomable. reply jltsiren 6 hours agorootparentprevThere is no green card category for being irreplaceable. PERM is for situations where it&#x27;s difficult to find equally good US workers, with \"equally good\" left intentionally vague. The idea is that the employer is expected to argue convincingly that the foreign applicant is clearly the best person for the job. That&#x27;s inherently subjective, but most things in immigration and the job market are.Sometimes there is a shortage of domestic candidates with sufficient qualifications and experience in the general field. Sometimes the job is highly specialized, and nobody outside of a handful of internal candidates can possibly do it without extensive training. Sometimes the candidate was selected according to the established standards of a profession, and the job only exists for that particular person. And so on.A fake application process is dishonest, regardless of whether it looks like a real job opportunity or is intentionally kept hidden. But if the process is open and you know in advance that no other candidate can possibly qualify, you are being not only dishonest but also impolite. Unrelated people may apply thinking it&#x27;s a real job opportunity, wasting their time. reply bubblethink 7 hours agorootparentprev>>The difference in opinion, AFAICT, is you think a GC is a reward for getting a job after besting others (including citizens) in interviews.No, the difference in opinion is the absurdity of it all. To the extent that the government (DOL) can influence the labor market, for any practical benefit, it needs to do so at the outset and quickly. The market is already altered here with a large immigrant workforce where there are no restrictions on being a temporary worker - even for years or decades. They just have fewer rights. And it doesn&#x27;t even work as intended. Let&#x27;s say that Apple wants to hire a permanent employee directly. The PERM process takes a year. Should every company just wait for a year so that DOL can get it together before they can hire employees ? They do what the current regulations permit - bring them as temp workers and let the PERM thing resolve in the background. reply theGnuMe 8 hours agorootparentprevThey are not supposed to jump through hoops. They created these positions, did not advertise them externally like other jobs the solicit for nor accept electronic submissions. You know those job notices in some random “break room” stapled to the notification board? That’s what this is and why they got nailed. reply Racing0461 8 hours agorootparentprevCanada did that. Obliterated their white collar job market. Worked out well for every one but the canadian born worker. reply janalsncm 7 hours agorootparentprev> There is no reason to assume that they’re being paid any less than others at Apple.Sure there is. The fact that permanent residency costs money and is often desirable means that there is value in a PERM position over a comparable one with no path to permanent residency. Therefore it is only natural for applicants to require less money to find the compensation desirable. reply User23 9 hours agorootparentprev> But the notion that I was taking the job of a native-born American was ridiculous because I had been doing the job in London before.This isn’t even wrong.Obviously you displaced a US citizen unless you’re trying to advance the risible position that no US citizen could do what you do. reply pavlov 1 hour agorootparent> Obviously you displaced a US citizen unless you’re trying to advance the risible position that no US citizen could do what you do.I didn&#x27;t displace anyone because the headcount in my department was global, not tied to location.I know it&#x27;s hard to accept for people with old-fashioned nationalist ideas about immigration, but a lot of well-paid jobs these days can be done anywhere in the world.These are not jobs in America, but rather they are jobs at American companies. And with these immigration policies you&#x27;re doing your best to make sure the job doesn&#x27;t get done in America.For myself, I left the US but still work for an American company. They pay me a California-level salary but I pay my taxes to Finland. From your point of view that must be somehow better than if I was doing the same job but paying taxes to USA? You&#x27;re losing out on the tax revenue, but at least you don&#x27;t have people like me as neighbors, so all is good, I guess. reply chabons 8 hours agorootparentprev> Obviously you displaced a US citizen [...]I&#x27;m not sure this is obvious. 1) Apple is a multi-national company, and hires an employee in the UK. 2) This employee relocates to the USAt what point do they displace the US citizen? All Apple jobs are not earmarked for US citizens (+residents, etc...), and they&#x27;re already doing the job when they move to the US. Unless they&#x27;re hired abroad for the express purpose of relocating to the US, then it&#x27;s not \"obvious\" to me that they&#x27;ve displaced anyone.Suppose I work in an org with dev teams in multiple countries. If I relocate from one site to another, am I freeing up a slot in the country I leave and taking one in the country I move to? reply 4death4 8 hours agorootparentAccording to TFA, the discrimination happens when Apple doesn’t adequately look for a U.S. employee and instead chooses to to relocate you to the US. How is that not obvious? If Apple is happy to hire you in the UK and you’re happy to live there, the DOJ isn’t going to ask many questions. reply izardak 7 hours agorootparentThis discussion is about EB2&#x2F;green card process, not L1&#x2F;H1 visa that employee is given when relocating to the US. That is why it is not obvoius. In a lot of cases, an employee works in UK (or another European) office for many years, then moves to the US on L1A visa, works there for several years, applies to green card (not with intent to stay in US forever, but because L1 visa (and H1 too) cannot be extended for more than 5&#x2F;6 years). Then to get this EB2&#x2F;green card document employer has to pretend that they plan to replace this person who is already working in this organization for 10 or more years. It is not specific for Apple, Intel is doing the same when a CPU architect from Haifa or fab engineer from Dublin is working in Hillsboro for several years and decide to stay for a few more years. Or google bringing someone from Zurich. reply 4death4 5 hours agorootparentYes… and you’re not allowed to do that unless you truly can’t find an American to fill the role. reply theGnuMe 8 hours agorootparentprevYes you are doing both actually.There is a special visa for this. In the US it is an L1 visa. reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is what economists call a \"partial equilibrium\" analysis. This is a polite(?) academic way of saying it&#x27;s wrong.Hiring workers does not displace other workers because they come with increased demand for labor of their own. It does increase specialization on the team because you need to find comparative advantage, but that&#x27;s nearly as much of an issue. reply BurningFrog 8 hours agorootparentprevMany engineering teams hire the good people they can find.If one quits, nothing says you&#x27;ll find another one, and you may keep going with one less person. reply Racing0461 8 hours agorootparentUnpopular opinion that throws a wrench into the whole h1b&#x2F;eb1&#x2F;eb2 debate.

For EB2 PhD is not needed - MS from online paper mill is enough. For EB3, any degree works.It&#x27;s not tens of thousands in cost - it&#x27;s below $10k all in.

It&#x27;s hard to explain why though.I work for a fully remote company. Most of us are based in the US but the company also hires people from some other countries through some kind of agency. Even though many, probably a majority of the US-based people are immigrants (myself included), and many don&#x27;t speak English any better than the agency people, there&#x27;s still somehow a clear divide. The agency people are great - talented, skilled, no issues. But somehow they understand the business less. Their contributions are purely technical. It&#x27;s clear that the company could not just can us all and hire the same number of agency guys, but it&#x27;s hard to explain why.My previous employer once tried to outsource some stuff to India and sent a guy over there to oversee it. It didn&#x27;t go well. But we had lots of Indian people before and since in the company, and they were great. They had the same background, same education. But they were local to the company.I often think of the first iPhone as an extreme example of what I&#x27;m trying to say. It was built in China using parts sourced from China. But it was invented in California, and it had to be. From the inventors and the builders there&#x27;s a sort of spectrum, a range of people, like the developers who conceived and wrote the first killer apps - and the closer you are to the inventing side of things, the closer you need to be to the heart of the company.If I had to put sum it up in a word, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s \"ambiguity\". Knowing what to do when you don&#x27;t have exact instructions requires you to be steeped in the same culture as the CEO and the main market. This isn&#x27;t a fixed thing: I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a market for luxury devices in China now that Americans find it hard to understand. But in general the countries that are the most developed have already experienced what other countries are going through, and thus they are uniquely positioned to dictate what the next big thing is.So companies will always have to do some hiring locally, and the harder the job, the more important it is to be local. reply astrange 56 minutes agorootparent> It&#x27;s a good question.

They advertised for positions in newspapers and only accepted paper applications for PERM positions, unlike their other jobs which are advertised online. This is mainly because you don&#x27;t want anyone actually applying for the PERM roles, since you need to prove no minimally (not most) qualified US citizen or PR could be found.I think long term this is going to make getting PERM approved more difficult. It already takes 2-3 years now (without any audits) to get an I-140 (green card) application approved, not to mention getting the card can take decades in some cases.People on H1B work visa can&#x27;t stay on it for more than 6 years unless they actually get through PERM and get I-140, so I&#x27;m expecting this change will have a chilling effect on employers sponsoring work visas and applying for PERM unless it&#x27;s a very specialized role.

The goal is on-time delivery and passable correctness at minimum cost. That might be fulfilled through in-house IT employees, a COTS product, an onshore or offshore consultancy, or some hybrid. In some cases there is no substitute for expensive in-house onshore talent, but the business is always incentivized to seek one.FAANG engineering shops are not like this at all. Tech teams on their own initiative or with very general charters conceive, create, and release products. If product “requirements” are even written down, there’s a good chance the lead engineers on the project are coauthors. Engineers beyond the entry level are expected to be curious, creative, self-directed… basically bounce around a general problem space creating value wherever and however they can, as long as stakeholders sign off prior to any disruptive changes and there’s a measurable impact to cite for year-end perf.The value created can be mind-boggling - and so can the compensation packages, at no real loss to management. Any team’s backlog of opportunities is deep, and all of them are much more valuable than any amount of wages that could conceivably be spent chasing them. You don’t just want the job done to spec at minimum cost - you want the most capable and innovative people you can get to be at the whiteboard thinking of jobs it would be interesting to do, because the carrying cost if they’re just okay is insignificant, and the upside if they pull something really brilliant is unlimited. replyraincom 11 hours agoparentprevWell, if X is working for a manager M for 3 years at Apple(for that matter, any company), M wants to make sure that wheoever applies to X&#x27;s role during the PERM process (labor certification to ensure that no US citizens&#x2F;perm residents are available to fill X&#x27;s role) gets dinged 100%, no exceptions whatsoever.

Other comments have argued PERM applicants are high-quality. That&#x27;s often not the case. Let me explain the process for non-Americans on how you go through employment-based immigration to the US.You get a work visa. There are typically 4 options. There are 4 major options (there are others that are less common):1. H1B: requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent experience. There is an annual quota. There are now more applicants than visas so there is a lottery. If you don&#x27;t get picked, try again next year. H1B is issued for 3 years and can be renewed for another 3. Beyond that, you have to leave or file a PERM application and you can stay while it&#x27;s pending. H1B is transferable with minimal effort to a new employer;2. TN visa: available to Canadians. It&#x27;s a 3 year nonimmigrant intent visa that requires. It can technically be renewed repeatedly but CBP is free to decide you&#x27;re really living here and just deny your visa. The conservative approach is that TN holders wishing to immigrate will transfer to an H1B when possible. H1Bs can have weird conditions like when and how often you can re-enter the country. Some countries don&#x27;t allow re-entry beyond the first year so leaving means going to a consulate and applying for a new visa;3. E3 visa: much like a TN but available to Australians. It&#x27;s 2 years, nonimmigrant intent and not transferable. There&#x27;s a quota but it&#x27;s never been hit. Many wishing to get a green card will also try to get an H1B at some point;4. L1 visa: large companies use this for transfers. Work in Canada or London for a year and then get transferred.This brings us to PERM. It&#x27;s basically a 2 step process:1. File a PERM. This involves many steps like getting a labor certification. This takes 6-24+ months. USCIS may randomly audit you, which can add 1-2 years. They may have a reason too but but they also randomly audit a large number of applications, allegedly to stop the system being gamed. The reality is that it&#x27;s arbitrary and capricious. Things may just randomly take 2 years longer for no reason at all. Once your number comes up (more on this below), you go to the next step;2. File an adjustment of status (\"AoS\"). There are 2 forms that can be filed concurrently (I-141 and I-485 IIRC). This should only take 6-12 months. It depends on your service center though. If there&#x27;s something weird about your application it may take longer with multiple rounds of RFE (\"Requests for Evidence\") that each take months to be examined.PERMs have a total quota and a per-country quota (of 7% of the total). And by \"country\" I mean \"country of birth\". Your passport doesn&#x27;t matter at all. If you&#x27;re born to Norwegian parents in Mumbai, you&#x27;ll be in the India queue and you don&#x27;t want to be there. Expect to wait 10-30 years because there is a backlog in the millions.Occasionally there&#x27;s some talk of Congress reforming this but nothing much has changed in a long time.So where&#x27;s the abuse? It takes 2 forms:1. The Department of Labor is meant to ensure you&#x27;re not underpaid (ie exploited). But they look at average pay for software engineers in a geographic area. For a Big Tech company, this could be substantially higher. But they don&#x27;t have to pay you that higher amount technically because you&#x27;re beholden to the company. If you leave you need to file a new PERM (but you keep your priority date). Still, this might add a year or two; and2. Oncd you have your green card you don&#x27;t need work authorization anymore so you can freely take a new job. So if you&#x27;re from India you&#x27;re effectively an indentured servant for decades because of the backlog.So H1Bs have no per-country quota but green cards do. We issue way more H1Bs to Indian-born workers than we issue green cards to so the queue is only getting longer. Bear in mind tooo that if you&#x27;re a worker with a spouse and two children you&#x27;ll need 4 from the quota not 1.So these bodyshop companies that employ a lot of Indian nationals flood the H1B pipeline. It&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a lottery. The companies don&#x27;t care who does and doesn&#x27;t get a visa. These are relatively low paying jobs, which in practice have bad conditions. The threat of being fired keepes workers from demanding better pay and conditions let alone leaving.Was apple engaging in these practices? I have no idea (and certainly no direct knowledge). But that&#x27;s what PERM abuse looks like.Honestly, work visas should just automatically convert to a green card after 6 years. reply civilized 7 hours agoparent> So if you&#x27;re from India you&#x27;re effectively an indentured servant for decades because of the backlog.> Honestly, work visas should just automatically convert to a green card after 6 years.Taking us from an extreme form of indentured servitude to the kind that was commonly practiced in the 18th century.

So the employer needs to petition for a \"permanent\" employee.3) So although these people are already employed, the employer needs to go through a PERM process where they advertise the job and claim to the gov. that they couldn&#x27;t hire anyone else and this is the most qualified employee for the job.4) Although it&#x27;s a farce, DOJ gets mad if there is a perception that the employer tried to make the PERM process more favorable to the employee they already have. reply NovemberWhiskey 11 hours agorootparentAnd if this doesn&#x27;t make it seem farcical enough: you would think that an employee who&#x27;d been working at your firm would have lots of unique skills and familiarity with corporate processes, technology etc. that are valuable, and that you could write a job description that required those.But no - your immigration law firm will tell you that you absolutely can&#x27;t do that, and that you have to pretend to hire into some kind of imaginary position that reflects the knowledge and skills of someone in the job market who would qualify but for the fact that they don&#x27;t have skills that could only be acquired at your firm. reply cogman10 11 hours agorootparentprevFor a non-citizen, becoming a citizen is a long process (Generally more than a few years). To actually stay in the US and move the process along employer sponsorship is key.This long process incentives non-citizens to do work at below market rates and to put up with less than ideal employment treatment. Which is great for most businesses as they can get a dev for cheap that they can work for long hours and hold their current residency in the US hostage (it&#x27;s not a simple process to switch employers).However, the law has on the books for programs like this and H1B that a company has to have first failed to fill their position with a US citizen. Apple is not unique here in fudging the \"tried to fill the position\" requirement. I suspect there&#x27;s more than a few big name company&#x27;s HR departments seeing this news and getting a little worried.I should note, the law also says PERM employees should be payed market rate... but market rate is a flexible thing and PERM employees are much less likely to complain. reply NovemberWhiskey 11 hours agorootparentprevSay you have an employee that you&#x27;ve hired on an H-1B. They&#x27;re a high-performer, and you want to retain them. You can only (not really, but mostly) stay beyond six years in the US on an H-1B if you&#x27;re on a green card trajectory - meaning that your employer has at least got a pending labor certification application for your position.Getting labor certification involves demonstrating that you&#x27;ve made a good faith effort to hire a US native worker to fill the position. So you have to try to hire into the role; but you really don&#x27;t want the search to succeed - because you&#x27;ve already got a good employee that&#x27;s a known quantity.Getting labor certification is a pre-requisite to getting an I-140, which is a pre-requisite to the employee getting the green card. Failing to achieve labor certification just delays the entire process and means yet more paperwork and time with the immigration attorneys. reply filoleg 11 hours agorootparentprevIncentive: you already have an employee on a visa working for you. They are a solid proven employee that you already invested money and other resources into (hiring&#x2F;recruiting costs, onboarding, training, visa paperwork, time of other engineers helping them out during onboarding, etc.). The employee understandably wants to continue working here or, at least, remain in the country. You, as the employer, can either sponsor their green card and go through PERM or risk losing them in the near future (either to a competitor who is willing to sponsor it or due to them leaving the country voluntarily or them getting hit with some visa issues further on). The incentive here is clear.So you decide to sponsor their green card process (as it makes sense in pretty much every aspect). Part of the application requirements is documentation proving that the employee that you are sponsoring isn’t displacing local workers and is truly high skill (given that H1B visa to green card conversion is intended for high-skill workers). The way that a lot of employers seem to be doing it is posting lowkey ads in newspapers and other places that technically would qualify, but that are unlikely to catch interest of potential candidates and are way more likely to go unnoticed. Then you wait some period of time. I don’t remember how long it is more precisely, but i remember that it is somewhere between 1-6 months. In the end, you got the document required to go forward with the process.My guess is that for large tech companies like FAANG it wouldn’t work like that, as their job postings are everywhere. But i think the fact that their interviews are notoriously difficult to pass (relative to most jobs outside of tech, where getting an interview itself is usually way more difficult, but once you got it, you are more likely to pass), that might work as a documented proof. Not sure, as I have never observed how those companies handle it, but I have seen some small employers do variations of the dance that I have described in the previous paragraph. reply ren_engineer 12 hours agoprev [–] >Apple agreed to pay up to $25 million in back payI&#x27;m sure that will be devastating for a company with 162 Billion in cash and really make them think twice reply deathanatos 9 hours agoparent [–] I usually scale these to \"if we fined a normal person\".

    "title": "Nordic Embraces RISC-V Architecture for Power-efficient IoT Applications",
    "originLink": "https://blog.nordicsemi.com/getconnected/why-nordic-is-getting-involved-in-risc-v",
    "originBody": "Back to articles Why Nordic is getting involved in RISC-V By Svein-Egil Nielsen November 1, 2023 Bluetooth LE RISC-V Nordic recently announced that it is joining an industry consortium of semiconductor companies to drive the adoption of an open source chip architecture called RISC-V. Why? RISC-V versus Arm At first glance, Nordic announcing that it is putting its full technological and commercial weight behind the development and adoption of an open-source chip architecture might raise questions about how strong the company’s on-going relationship with Arm is. After all, Arm provides a commercial chip architecture that is anything but open source, and has been used on Nordic's semiconductor wireless connectivity products since the 2012 launch of Nordic's nRF51 Series Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). The nRF51 Series redefined the leading-edge of the Bluetooth LE market once and for all. And one of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of a powerful on-board Arm processor for the very first time on a Bluetooth chip. Nothing like it had ever been seen before in the Bluetooth LE market. In fact, the nRF51 Series literally sent Nordic's competitors scrambling back to the drawing board when it came to how to design a Bluetooth LE chip. RISC-V will complement Arm RISC-V was developed about 10 years ago at UC Berkeley in the U.S. and at first glance would seem to be competitive with Arm. But I think this is way too narrow a view. I see RISC-V in a similar way to how I see the proliferation of wireless IoT connectivity standards: no one technology can be all things to (solve) all application problems. So does Bluetooth LE really compete with Thread or cellular IoT ? Of course not. Each is designed to do different things well, but not everything. What RISC-V is in reality, therefore, is a complimentary alternative to Arm, and not a threat. And this is particularly true in power consumption-critical mobile and IoT applications where Arm has traditionally been dominant. Optimizing for lowest power At its heart, RISC-V is all about promoting innovation by giving users the ability to develop leading-edge, customized hardware based on an open-source chip architecture. What RISC-V will do for Nordic's customers is give them the freedom and flexibility, in certain specific and highly specialized applications, to strip down the instruction set to ensure extreme levels of low power consumption. To me, this is no different to how you can strip down a 2.4GHz proprietary wireless protocol to optimize for the ultra lowest power consumption in a way you simply could not match at such extremes with a standards-based protocol such as Bluetooth low energy. Now RISC-V isn't of course proprietary. But just like a Nordic proprietary 2.4GHz protocol, if you are the developer behind it, you get far more control over every line of code to customize for the specific needs of your specific application. Lowest power counts at the edge So where might the ability to develop an ultra lowest power instruction set really come into its own? To me it's at the edge in, for example, simpler embedded chips for sensors that require a small bit of processing power in order to deliver localized machine learning. In such applications having an Arm core would be complete overkill. But that sensor may still need to communicate with and work alongside an Arm core-based Nordic device. More options What RISC-V will do is give our customers an extra option when seeking to minimize power consumption in certain applications where the (many) tradeoffs of not using an Arm-based core are acceptable. RISC-V will also lower the barriers-to-entry and level the playing field when it comes to developing IoT applications. This will encourage even greater innovation in the IoT market. What RISC-V will not do is conflict with Nordic's long-established use of Arm cores in its wireless IoT connectivity devices. RISC-V will simply further enhance the design options for Nordic customers and particularly in simpler, ultra lowest power applications where every Joule and Watt counts.

Among the western chip companies, they are the ideal candidate for RISC-V adoption. I&#x27;m very curious to see what TI is planning for RISC-V as they begin to seriously engage in the low cost general purpose microcontroller market for the first time. reply audunw 19 hours agoparent> \"getting crushed by a wave of very low cost Chinese competitors\"That&#x27;s an odd way of spelling \"maintaining a stable market share in the face of Chinese competition\".Going forward, IoT security is going to be an increasingly important factor for new designs. The EU is quite serious about combating security problems with IoT devices. And security is something that the new products coming out of Nordic is very serious about.I don&#x27;t think many big, serious device manufacturers are willing to risk being the target of the first catastrophic IoT attack just to save some pennies on a dirt cheap Chinese design, with some poorly verified RISC-V core thrown in with a power hungry Bluetooth radio.ARM TrustZone is not something the RISC-V ecosystem has a clear standardized answer to yet. So I think that&#x27;s a reason why ARM will keep its role as the main application processor in high-end BT&#x2F;Thread chips for the next several years. reply paulgerhardt 18 hours agorootparentHaving bought a few hundred thousand Nordic chips I can assure you they don’t care about security in a meaningful sense.All Nordic chips are susceptible to bootloader attacks which make them a poor choice for storing key material. This can be mitigated in the design phase by adding an external security chip like a ATECC608B but if you were to tear down a device and see a board present without this module it certainly will have other vulnerabilities too.Having worked extensively with both Nordic and Chinese chips, what makes Nordic win is the ease of development - they are by far the best in market when it comes to programmability. Hands down.The security problems have been known since the NRF51 and despite that those vulnerabilities were carried over into the NRF52 because the cost of validation of chip designs is so prohibitive they did not want to touch it and filed the “oh some random person can extract the entire contents of the chip” bug as “won’t fix”. They are baked into a silicon ip core and can’t be fixed with a software update.As for RISC-V, there are some amazingly innovative and brilliant alternatives to TrustZone presented at the conference but I suspect Rambus may block innovation here using their position on the board (and chairing the security standing committee) in favor of their own (patented) solutions using an embrace, extend, extinguish strategy. reply AussieWog93 13 hours agorootparent>Having worked extensively with both Nordic and Chinese chips, what makes Nordic win is the ease of developmentThis seems to be the norm for Chinese chips in general.Poor documentation, even in the native Chinese, no official dev boards, sometimes no JTAG debuggers, random bugs, just a whole lot of bullshit to deal with as a foreign developer.I suspect it might be a cultural thing; developers are less prone to pouring over data sheets and more prone to asking their friends&#x2F;colleagues to introduce them to someone who works at one of the microcontroller companies.

RISC-V involvement is possibly toe in the water stuff&#x2F;de-risking from ARM (\"who owns them today?\"). The recent big switch in SDK&#x27;s (nrfSDK to Zephyr) wasn&#x27;t teribly welcome, so the possiblility of another one is not welcome (if there was an approximately equal competitor with more stability we&#x27;d jump ship). reply weinzierl 17 hours agorootparentprev\"I don&#x27;t think many big, serious device manufacturers are willing to risk being the target of the first catastrophic IoT attack [..]\"You must be kidding, right?

The big, serious device manufacturers will do the design themselves by starting with an open reference design and making some minor modifications that suit them, then pay someone to fab it because they&#x27;re shipping millions of units. Who does that even leave?> ARM TrustZone is not something the RISC-V ecosystem has a clear standardized answer to yet.This has almost nothing to do with IoT security, if not being directly opposed to it as a thing used to prevent people from installing custom firmware on devices the OEM fails to support.The #1 problem in IoT security is OEMs that release a device which they neither patch nor allow anyone else to patch. And the first can&#x27;t be a solution for small OEMs because they go out of business, so the only way to actually fix it is to have devices that users can update with third party firmware. For which the lack of ARM TrustZone is an advantage, since it&#x27;s often used to prevent this. reply josephcsible 18 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t TrustZone inherently evil, though? Isn&#x27;t its main use to let the megacorps trust that your device won&#x27;t do what you want and will keep secrets from you? reply tremon 11 hours agorootparentTrustZone doesn&#x27;t run on a separate processor like the x86 TPM. It&#x27;s more like a hypervisor-level ring fence than a coprocessor. reply sweetjuly 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat are you talking about? TrustZone is an ISA feature which lets you mark certain pages as \"secure only\". Compliant devices with SMMUs should not allow any access to these pages except when initiated by the secure world. It&#x27;s not some big evil plan by Arm. It&#x27;s up to vendors how they use it. Many just use it for key storage and verifying biometric data so that even a compromised kernel can&#x27;t trivially steal the most sensitive data on a device.If you start building your own hardware and&#x2F;or buy devices with unlocked bootloaders, you can load whatever you want in EL3 to play with TZ. This isn&#x27;t a problem with TZ. reply KerrAvon 17 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t tell if this is sarcasm. TrustZone is a technology for resource isolation. At an extremely high nontechnical level, it&#x27;s conceptually similar to memory protection. reply josephcsible 16 hours agorootparentThe problem with TrustZone is that control of it always resides with a megacorp and never with the owner of the device. It&#x27;s not that it isn&#x27;t security at all, but rather that it&#x27;s security against the owner. reply msgilligan 14 hours agorootparentThe owner can control Trustzone if the device is shipped with unfused OTP registers.On Raspberry Pi for example, you can write the hash of your own public key to locations 47-54 of the OTP memory block:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;computers&#x2F;raspberr...Here&#x27;s the QuickStart for the entire process: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;raspberrypi&#x2F;usbboot&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;secure-bo...Note that the Raspberry Pi does not have a full TrustZone implementation to protect secure mode memory, etc. But it is a widely available device with good documentation and allows developers to experiment with and learn about the basics of TrustZone architecture. reply josephcsible 13 hours agorootparentOTP and e-fuses are also evil. Devices should never be forced to become e-waste over them being set \"wrong\". There should always be a factory reset option that clears everything. reply PennRobotics 12 hours agorootparentHow do you propose patching security vulnerabilities in deployed devices? reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentWhy would that require fuses? You store the firmware in flash, which can be updated to a newer version, restored to the original version or replaced entirely with third party firmware by the device&#x27;s owner if the OEM fails to patch it, e.g. because they go out of business. replymsgilligan 14 hours agorootparentprevThis shouldn&#x27;t be downvoted. It is a legitimate question and widely held misconception that is addressed in several of the responses to parent. reply fullstop 20 hours agoparentprevUnless things have changed recently, Nordic is still king of low power applications.With that being said, I&#x27;ve worked with both the Nordic NRF SDK and the Espressif SDK and greatly preferred Espressif.For doo-dads that I make for my home, esp32 and esp8266 are fantastic. The modules are inexpensive and the community is huge. I would not want to be in Nordic&#x27;s shoes right now. reply freeopinion 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s easy for us hobbiests to forget that all the spare do-dads we have floating around our workbench aren&#x27;t even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of chips bought by a single manufacturer for a single model of a kitchen blender.We matter a little and can be somewhat of an indicator sometimes. Right up until we don&#x27;t. A lot of times what matters to us just doesn&#x27;t apply at scale. reply StillBored 13 hours agorootparentBut these kinds of things also seem to follow a tech playbook, cheap parts show up, lots of hobbyist, small companies, etc start using them in low volume applications. They work out the bugs, and the newer competitors parts keep getting better. The existing big company doesn&#x27;t care because, as someone else pointed out they are maintaining a stable volume&#x2F;revenue.Only, in the tech industry that&#x27;s almost always a bad sign, the competitors are winning new designs that haven&#x27;t yet really started to ramp, while the existing vendor is coasting on the current device using their parts. Then what happens is they get stuck in a declining revenue&#x2F;volume situation while the newer cheaper better competitor slowly eats the market, and at that point investing in a \"dying\" product just about never happens. reply wallaBBB 19 hours agorootparentprevThere are actually 2 Nordic SDKs, nRF5 (now in maintenance, but still in many supported products in the field) and nRF Connect (bundled with Zephyr). Later gives a lot of access to both Host and Controller part of the stack and for commercial products that are not simply flipping a lightbulb it is still a standard. ESPs are good for quick hacks and more competitive with Nordic if low power is not an imperative. reply fullstop 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve only used the nRF5 SDK. It worked, and it worked well, but it was cumbersome to work with if you didn&#x27;t want to keep your code in the same tree as the the SDK itself. This was probably an organizational issue on my part, honestly.The other thing which really bit me was someone here used a symbol name which collided with one used in the SDK, but the build system allowed this to link without error. reply wallaBBB 19 hours agorootparentnRF5 is indeed inferior SDK of the 2 (thus abandoned). Also I dislike that a big chunk of the stack there is a binary blob. Regarding the code organization, not sure what toolchain you used, but the latest recommendation for nRF5 (Segger studio) could make it fairly easy to do this, but manually opening the project config files and changing them, not through the GUI.nRF Connect is a different world, comes with a lot more options, some really rooted in Zephyr OS, some lessons learned from the prior SDK. And if you&#x27;re familiar with Linux build configuration system, that is basically what Zephyr brings to the table (comes from Linux foundation). But yeah all that flexibility comes as a penalty when you want simple stuff, compared to ESP32-Sx reply fullstop 19 hours agorootparent> nRF5 is indeed inferior SDK of the 2 (thus abandoned).

They took the ZephyrOS approach, but it comes with a learning curve penalty, unless you go the easy route of nRF Connect GUI. In that case you do have some limitations of how you organize the code base (so that the GUI works), but even that is miles ahead in configuration compared with to the nRF5 SDK + Segger Studio.Some skim reading material about it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nordicsemi.com&#x2F;nRF_Connect_SDK&#x2F;doc&#x2F;latest&#x2F;...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nordicsemi.com&#x2F;nRF_Connect_SDK&#x2F;doc&#x2F;latest&#x2F;... reply 5ADBEEF 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is a Zephyr BLE stack that can be used as well as a SoftDevice stack but SoftDevice isn&#x27;t a huge binary anymore, much more modular to save code space. reply lgg 13 hours agorootparentprevI have been out of this area for almost a decade now, but I have very fond memories of the nRF5 SDK. When I was evaluating the (then new) Nordic BLE SoC&#x27;s for future products it was so much nicer than the TI CC2540 we had used in our first BLE device. reply zh3 13 hours agorootparentprevThe simple hack is a softlink to the actual SDK.On the other hand, checking in the whole SDK as part of a project gives an impressive LoC tally ;)Link issue was possibly macro craziness? The scars of sdk_config.h etc. reply fullstop 12 hours agorootparentIf you base your project off of one of the examples, the project file has relative paths back to the SDK. For example: No amount of symlinking can fix this, and there&#x27;s a lot of these files. Maybe copying an example project is not the right way to do things.The link issue was, I think, the result of what Nordic does with weak symbols. I don&#x27;t recall the symbol name, but it was something which caused very unusual results.Regarding LoC tallies, I often try to minimize mine. :-) reply zh3 2 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re using segger, a quick find-and-replace will take care of that (ditto GCC Makefiles). Must admit that when I started with nrf52 SDK, I too used thge embed-the-application-inside-the-SDK approach. Pretty soon that got cumbersome, so I switched to the softlink approach. The exact approach is to store the SDK somewhere, create a softlink to it in the project directory and have the project files&#x2F;makefiles use that instead. replyahartmetz 20 hours agoparentprev> is getting crushed by a wave of very low cost Chinese competitorsOh lordy.

I think one problem is the lack of a combined BT&#x2F;WiFi chip.I think once Zephyr becomes more mature and there&#x27;s more tutorials&#x2F;guides around it, a good BT+Thread+WiFi solution from Nordic could become very popular.

Same for micro:bit. It&#x27;s just plain USB.Right, the devkits can do this. If you want to go past that, like making your own PCB with a NRF52 on it you need JTAG, which is not a requirement for esp32.Maybe the NRF52 has some sort of ROM serial loader that I&#x27;ve missed though. reply SwaraLink 19 hours agorootparentIt’s actually possible to use the debugger on the NRF dev kits to flash&#x2F;debug custom PCBs with NRF chips. So a separate (more expensive) JTAG debugger is in fact not required. reply m-ee 16 hours agorootparentYes nrf dev boards have an on board j-link, and Nordic provides instructions on how to turn the board into a programmer. Their licensing with segger explicitly allows this as long as you use it for other Nordic devices. Much cheaper than a standalone j-link. reply graphe 19 hours agorootparentprevWhere are the nRF52 usb dongles for $10? reply nxa 18 hours agorootparentHave you looked at Mouser or Digikey? $9.60 for per unit, in single unit quantities, heaps in stock as of today. reply graphe 18 hours agorootparentNo, I usually get chips on AliExpress or eBay since I usually use esp32 for free shipping and they&#x27;re $20 or more on there. reply wallaBBB 19 hours agorootparentprevGDB options for debugging&#x2F;flashing can be had for sub 10eur, Segger is not mandatory.

I watched someone on youtube recommend it due to the small space and low profile. You can use the VSCode NRF Connect SDK plugin (coupled with Jlink or NRF52 dev kit) to flash the device. But of course you can just use USB und copy a generated .hex file directly on the device. I use SWD because its faster to flash many boards by just pressing the pogo pins on the connector pad.

I used to be more balanced in my views. I am not a hardware person, just a humble programmer, but articles about RISC-V always interest me. reply antoniuschan99 18 hours agoprevNordic recently released news that their bluetooth power consumption is even lower (AirTags uses it). They also released a WiFi chip, but it&#x27;s more like a co-processor so it&#x27;s not really a competitor to ESP chips because you will still need a microcontroller. Espressif bluetooth isn&#x27;t comparable because they still haven&#x27;t gotten the battery consumption down to uA levels yet :$.On the flip side, Esp is releasing the P4 which is just a microcontroller (no wifi or bluetooth so you&#x27;ll need an ESP32 for co-processing) as there&#x27;s things you can&#x27;t currently do on esp32&#x27;s such as mipi csi to interface with a wider range of camera modules easily.Lastly, I recently discovered a lot of Chinese IoT stuff you get on Amazon (eg. Tuya and Tasmota) have migrated away from Espressif and use Beken (Google OpenBeken).

ARM can&#x27;t compete in power usage with RV&#x27;s simple and clean ISA, just like x86 can&#x27;t compete with ARM&#x27;s power optimised design. Ultimately power usage decides everything.Eventually there will advanced RV implementations that outdo everything x64 and ARM can offer because of the RV design advantage and because there will be multiple players completing to capture market share. Intel no longer has a process advantage, and is unlikely to ever regain it. reply flumpcakes 19 hours agoparentDoes a \"clean\" vs. \"messy\" ISA really affect power utilisation more than low single digits?I can&#x27;t see what the difference is outside the FE decoding.Perhaps an ISA having more useful instructions would matter, as we would then be able to implement hardware optimisations. But just having poor ISA encoding or inconsistency seems, to my uneducated eyes, more of a human problem than a machine problem? reply dkjaudyeqooe 19 hours agorootparentI think complexity always costs. You have to devote more gates to implementing it, more engineering, more area, and more power.People claim that there is no efficiency difference in ISAs, but why did Intel not implement a low power processor to compete with ARM, even when it had a process advantage? Maybe they could have pulled it off in terms of power budget but the implementation was too hard. reply Qwertious 18 hours agorootparent>I think complexity always costs. You have to devote more gates to implementing it, more engineering, more area, and more power.Complexity also benefits - instead of having to do 12 different simple instruction, you can just do the one obscure instruction appropriate to the situation.The question is whether the actual perf benefits outweigh the costs, and the only correct answer to this is to actually measure what runs faster.Currently we don&#x27;t have a decades-mature RISC-V chip, but ARM currently outperforms RISC-V massively so it&#x27;s best to reserve judgement, and not make any hasty claims. Especially since people were claiming RISC would beat out CISC since at least the 90s, and yet three decades later CISC still dominates. reply brucehoult 11 hours agorootparent> ARM currently outperforms RISC-V massivelyOnly if you compare CPUs with vastly different microarchitectures e.g. a 4-wide OoO Arm and a single issue in-order RISC-V, or an Arm running SIMD code to a RISC-V CPU without SIMD&#x2F;Vector.Arm has more advanced microarchitectures and Neon deployed in the field right at this moment, certainly, but RISC-V vendors have cores up to Cortex-X3 (SiFive) or even Zen&#x2F;M1 level designed, simulated, and announced and those will all be in chips you can buy in 3-4 years.Comparing similar to similar e.g. SiFive U74 vs Arm A55 (on code not using Neon) you&#x27;ll find very similar performance, and in my experience the U74 usually winning. reply gary_0 17 hours agorootparentprev> instead of having to do 12 different simple instruction, you can just do the one obscure instruction appropriate to the situationThat one instruction just turns into 12 micro-ops, though, and then you need a much more complicated front-end to decode it. (And a smart enough compiler to use it in the first place.)You do benefit from higher code density, but when you compare real-world RISC and CISC code the size difference is arguably small enough that it&#x27;s not worth it, especially when there are other improvements to spend resources on that provide more benefits, like better branch prediction.Also, instruction sets like ARM and RISC-V aren&#x27;t needlessly minimalist, so you still get \"extra\" instructions such as vector&#x2F;SIMD extensions where it makes sense. The old-school kitchen-sink instruction sets aren&#x27;t popular any more for a reason. reply brucehoult 11 hours agorootparentprev> I can&#x27;t see what the difference is outside the FE decoding.In a sufficiently small CPU, the instruction decoder becomes a very significant proportion of the whole thing.As an example of this consider the SeRV bit-serial RV32I core, which on a Xilinx FPGA uses 125 LUTs (most simple RISC-V cores use 1000-2000).QeRV was just introduced, with a 4-bit wide data path and ALU instead of 1-bit wide. It increases speed by 3x while increasing the LUT count by 15%.Clearly, instruction fetch &#x2F; decode &#x2F; control was totally dominating the data path. And still is on QeRV.A couple of obvious RISC-V instruction decoding advantages over any of Arm&#x27;s ISAs:- src and dst registers are always encoded in the same bits in RISC-V but not in Arm. e.g. in A32 all data processing instructions have Rd in bits 15:12, except MUL & MULA put Rd in bits 19:16, and STR and other store instructions (which don&#x27;t have an Rd) use bits 15:12 for the src register whose contents are to be stored. This seems trivial, but it adds significant extra muxes and wiring on a small design.- It&#x27;s the same in T16 (and the 16-bit opcodes in T32) which usually has Rd in bits 2:0, except the store instructions use those bits for a src register, and SP-relative load&#x2F;store and \"load address\" (add a constant to SP or PC) have the Rd (again a src for store) in bits 10:8. So this hits Arm&#x27;s smallest Cortex-M0 core.- RISC-V uses slightly funky encodings for constants&#x2F;offsets of varying sizes (including LUI and AUIPC, which encode bits 31:12, and conditional and unconditional branches, which do not encode bit 0) which minimises the number of places in the instruction that bits in the final 32 bit constant come from. This adds a couple of lines of code to assemblers and disassemblers, and makes it harder for humans trying to encode or decode binary instructions (mostly branch offsets), but considerably simplifies the muxes and wiring in the instruction decoder.T16 also simply has a lot of instruction formats (19) and instructions (close to 90?) compared to RV32I&#x27;s 4 formats (6 counting the different offset encoding for branch instructions, but src&#x2F;dst&#x2F;opcode etc are in the same places) and 37 instructions.RISC-V&#x27;s \"C\" extension (16 bit opcodes) adds nine more instruction formats, but that&#x27;s optional and on a very small CPU core in an application with not much program code you can choose to not implement it. reply ben-schaaf 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t see how you can come to this conclusion. The first generation of AMD mobile chips on a comparable process node to Apple only just released and the 7840u is even with the M2 Max in multi-core performance while using less power.I think the conclusion to draw here is that Apple&#x27;s efficiency advantage seems to be rooted outside the ISA. Their idle power usage from what I&#x27;ve seen is very impressive. reply jplrssn 19 hours agoparentprevCan you point to something specific in the Arm ISA for embedded CPUs that makes it less power-efficient than the RISC-V equivalent? reply brucehoult 11 hours agorootparentSee https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38225898 reply mardifoufs 19 hours agoparentprevIs risc-v really more power efficient at similar performance levels?

The point is that simplicity and elegance enables efficiency. reply mannyv 15 hours agorootparentEnables, but does not guarantee.The PPC ISA is simple, but the POWER chips themsleves were never designed for power efficiency.Likewise the ARM ISA is now associated with power efficiency, but there&#x27;s nothing in the ISA itself that mandates power efficiency.In fact, I&#x27;ll bet a clever chip designer could design an x86 (or x86_64) chip that was low power. That would be a killer exercise. I want to say some of the third party licensees tried to do that with their x86 SoCs a long time ago. They failed for different reasons. reply brucehoult 11 hours agorootparentThe PPC ISA is huge, with a vast number of instructions (hundreds), which implies a lot of energy-sucking decoder circuitry -- and data path too.RISC-V allows tiny designs with just 37 instructions.

    "originBody": "Charlie's Diary Being the blog of Charles Stross, author, and occasional guests ... [ Home ] [ FAQ ] [ Contact me ] [ Older stuff ] Back to: I should blog more, but ... We're sorry we created the Torment Nexus By Charlie Stross (This is the text of a talk I delivered at the Next Frontiers Applied Fiction Day in Stuttgart on Friday November 10th, 2023. Note: early draft, contains some typos, I'll fix them next week when I get home.) In 2021, writer and game designer Alex Blechman inadvertently created a meme: Sci-Fi Author: \"In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale.\" Tech Company: \"At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from classic sci-fi novel Don't Create The Torment Nexus!\" Hi. I'm Charlie Stross, and I tell lies for money. That is, I'm a science fiction writer: I have about thirty novels in print, translated into a dozen languages, I've won a few awards, and I've been around long enough that my wikipedia page is a mess of mangled edits. And rather than giving the usual cheerleader talk making predictions about technology and society, I'd like to explain why I—and other SF authors—are terrible guides to the future. Which wouldn't matter, except a whole bunch of billionaires are in the headlines right now because they pay too much attention to people like me. Because we invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale and they took it at face value and decided to implement it for real. Obviously, I'm talking about Elon Musk. (He named SpaceX's drone ships after Iain M. Banks spaceships, thereby proving that irony is dead). But he's not the only one. There's Peter Thiel (who funds research into artificial intelligence, life extension, and seasteading. when he's not getting blood transfusions from 18 year olds in hope of living forever). Marc Andreesen of Venture Capitalists Andreesen Horowitz recently published a self-proclaimed \"techno-optimist manifesto\" promoting the bizarre accelerationist philosophy of Nick Land, among other weirdos, and hyping the current grifter's fantasy of large language models as \"artificial intelligence\". Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, is another. He's another space colonization enthusiast like Elon Musk, but while Musk wants to homestead Mars, Bezos is a fan of Gerard K. O'Neill's 1970s plan to build giant orbital habitat cylinders at the Earth-Moon L5 libration point. And no tour of the idiocracy is complete without mentioning Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire CEO of Facebook, who blew through ten billion dollars trying to create the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash, only for it to turn out that his ambitious commercial virtual reality environment had no legs. (That was a deliberate pun.) It'd be amusing if these guys didn't have a combined net worth somewhere in the region of half a trillion euros and the desire to change the human universe, along with a load of unexamined prejudices and a bunch of half-baked politics they absorbed from the predominantly American SF stories they read in their teens. I grew up reading the same stuff but as I also write the modern version of the same stuff for a living I've spent a lot of time lifting up the rocks in the garden of SF to look at what's squirming underneath. Science fiction influences everything this century, both our media and our physical environment. Media first: about 30% of the big budget movies coming out of the US film industry these days are science fiction or fantasy blockbusters, a massive shift since the 1970s. Computer games are wall-to-wall fantasy and SF—probably a majority of the field, outside of sports and simulation games. (Written fiction is another matter, and SF/F combined amount to something in the range 5-10% of books sold. But reading novels is a minority recreation this century, having to compete with the other media I just named. The golden age of written fiction was roughly 1850 to 1950, give or take a few decades: I make my living in an ageing field, kind of like being a classical music composer or an 8-bit games programmer today.) Meanwhile the influence of science fiction on our environment seems to have been gathering pace throughout my entire life. The future is a marketing tool. Back in the early 20th century it was anything associated with speed—recall the fad for streamlining everything from railway locomotives to toasters, or putting fins on cars. Since about 1970 it becme more tightly associated with communication and computers. For an example of the latter trend: a decade or two ago there was a fad for cellular phones designed to resemble the original Star Trek communicator. The communicator was movie visual shorthand for \"a military two-way radio, but make it impossibly small\". But it turns out that enough people wanted an impossibly small clamshell telephone that once semiconductor and battery technology got good enough to make one, they made the Motorola Razr a runaway bestseller. \"Artificial intelligence\" and \"computer controlled\" became marketing buzzwords decades ago. They're used to mis-sell cars described as \"self-driving\" and technologies like Tesla's so-called \"autopilot\". In reality, aircraft autopilots don't do what most people think they do (they require constant monitoring by pilots). And self-driving car software is dangerously insufficient to do the job, as witness the recent revelation that self-driving taxi firm Cruise—recently banned from San Fracisco after a pedestrian was dragged under one of their cars—requires constant human supervision. But as long as it sells cars to customers who think it means they can relax and watch a movie while they commute, why should Elon Musk care? Science fictional TV shows like \"Knight Rider\" in the 1980s primed those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s to expect intelligent self-driving cars in the near future, and there has been a gold rush to sell self-driving cars, even though the technology isn't ready yet and has lethal failure modes. Because anything that tastes of the future is marketing gold. It's becoming increasingly unusual to read a report of a new technology or scientific discovery that doesn't breathlessly use the phrase \"it seems like science fiction\". The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies—which turned out to be a financial services bubble that drained a lot of small investors' savings accounts into the pockets of people like convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. It's also driving politics and law. Recently in the UK, Elon Musk paid a visit to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Last week we were given a preview of the government's legislative program for the coming year, and guess what it contained? Yes: new laws to permit self-driving vehicles on the roads, and regulation of artificial intelligence. And while some degree of government monitoring and regulation of these sectors is welcome, the UK has much bigger problems right now—and I'd rather the laws weren't drafted by an Elon Musk fanboy. Now I've shouted as passing clouds for a bit—or dangerous marketing fads based on popular entertainment of decades past—I'd like to talk about something that I personally find much more worrying: a political ideology common among silicon valley billionaires of a certain age—known by the acronym TESCREAL—that is built on top of a shaky set of assumptions about the future of humanity. It comes straight out of an uncritical reading of the bad science fiction of decades past, and it's really dangerous. TESCREAL stands for \"transhumanism, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, rationalism (in a very specific context), Effective Altruism, and longtermism.\" It was identified by Timnit Gebru, former technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google and founder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), and Émile Torres, a philosopher specialising in existential threats to humanity. These are separate but overlapping beliefs that are particularly common in the social and academic circles associated with big tech in California. Prominent advocates on the transhumanist and AI side include Ray Kurzweil, a notable technology evangelist and AI researcher at Google, philosophers Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky, and going back a long way earlier, Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, whose writings brought Russian Cosmism to America. Sam Bankman-Fried is an outspoken advocate of Effective Altruism, another element of this overlapping web of beliefs. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, as noted, both seem to be heavily influenced by Tsiolkovsky's advocacy of space colonization. Musk's Neuralink venture, attempting to pioneer human brain-computer interfaces, seems intent on making mind uploading workable, which in turn points to the influences of Kurzweil and other singularitarians. And hiding behind these 20th and early 21st century thinkers are older influences—notably the theological speculation of 19th century Russian Orthodox priest Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov. How did this ideology come about, and why do I think it's dangerous? (Longtermism is the belief that we should discount short-term harms to real existing human beings—such as human-induced climate change—if it brings us closer to the goal of colonizing the universe, because the needs of trillions of future people who don't actually exist yet obviously outweigh the needs of today's global poor. If you accept that it's our destiny as a species to take over the cosmos, then it follows that longtermist entrepreneurs are perfectly justified in moving fast, breaking things, and ruthlessly maximizing profit extraction, as long as they spend their wealth on colonizing Mars. Which is just the first step on the road to conquering the galaxy and a bunch of other stuff like mind uploading, becoming immortal, creating artificial intelligences to do all the tedious work, resurrecting the dead, and taking over the universe. It posits a destiny for humanity, which of necessity makes it a secular religion. It means that if you don't believe in their plans, then you're some kind of anti-science backsliding reactionary heretic. And if this sounds just slightly insane to you, well, that's probably because you're not Elon Musk or Peter Thiel.) Speaking as a science fiction writer, I'd like to offer a heartfelt apology for my part in the silicon valley oligarchy's rise to power. And I'd like to examine the toxic role of science fiction in providing justifications for the craziness. So, here's the thing: science fiction is fiction. And while we can dress it up in fancy clothes and declare that fiction is an artistic form for exploring the human condition, we're tip-toeing past the slaughterhouse with attached sausage factory—the industry that takes the raw material and puts it in front of us. As an editor once told me, \"you can write anything you want, but we don't have to publish it.\" And without publishers, or some mechanism for replicating and advertising the existence of your text, you won't have any readers. [[ Publishers, incidentally, are not monolithic. They're hives of human activity where people working in different departments each do their bit to try and turn the product they're taking in at one end—raw book manuscripts are about as appetizing as a raw animal carcass, they take a lot of work to make them appealing—into saleable books or tasty-looking sausages. I'm not going to get into the minutiae of trade publishing or we'd be here for the rest of the year, but as an author, my job is to convince an editor to buy my book. The editor's job is then to convince the marketing department that this book is commercially viable. And the marketing department try to push it in the very specific media channels that bookshop staff read to decide what products to order in next month. So there's a long chain of whispers between the author and the reader, and because a book that doesn't sell will cost each intermediary money, and there are hundreds of books per month to choose between, it's easier for them to say \"no\" than to say \"yes\". I'm focussing here on a very specific channel, namely novels that are written and sold via traditional big publishing companies. Different constraints apply to different formats and different sales channels -- say, short fiction or web serials, sold via anthologies or self-published direct to Kindle or other ebook storefronts. But there's almost always a middle-man, even if you're self-publishing (the middle-man in this case is Patreon or Ko-Fi or Amazon an ad exchange somewhere: it's whoever processes payments for you). The only way to completely avoid middle-men is to give your work away for free. The same is true of other media, such as film, TV, music, and games. If you refuse to compromise with your audience's expectations they will put the book down, flip channel, or leave a one-star review on Steam. So I exist in a symbiotic relationship with my readers. They keep buying my books as long as they remain enjoyable. And my publishers keep publishing my books as long as the readers keep buying them. So like other SF writers I've got a financial incentive to write books that readers find enjoyable, and that usually means conforming to their pre-existing biases. Which are rooted in the ideas they absorbed previously. Science fiction as a genre has inertia, and it's hard to get new ideas to stick if they force the readers out of their comfort zone. The science fiction genre that today's billionaires grew up with—the genre of the 1970s—has a history going back to an American inventor and publisher called Hugo Gernsback. Gernsback founded the first magazine about electronics and radio in the United States, Modern Electrics, in 1908, but today he's best remembered as the founder of the pulp science fiction magazine Amazing Stories in 1926. The early 1908 issues of Modern Electrics would be instantly recognizable to a teenage personal computing enthusiast of the 1970s and early 1980s—the same generation as the tech billionaires this talk is really about. The first two decades of the 20th century saw a huge explosion of interest in the field of wireless—radio broadcasting as we know it today, but also amateur radio. Radio sets back then were hand-built and repaired by local enthusiasts, much like many early personal computers. Gernsback founded Modern Electrics to carry adverts for radio components and to promote the amateur radio hobby. He curated a directory of amateur radio users and their call signs and equipment, published articles about building and operating your own wireless set, and editorialized about the future of radio. Amateur radio grew explosively in the nineteen-teens, and just like computer hobbyists half a century later, many of the radio hobbyists ended up working in the industry. Gernsback began to publish general articles about science and technology, then fiction with a focus on the science—including some of his own stories—culminating in starting the magazine Amazing Stories as a vehicle for fantastic tales about a technological future. And as a runaway commercial success, Amazing Stories spawned imitators and, eventually, an industry. (We can skip over the details of how SF publishing developed from the earnest technophiliac visions of Gernsback to the two-fisted planetary romances of the pulp magazines in the 1920s, survived the collapse of the pulp magazine distribution network in the 1950s and migrated to paperback novels sold in wire racks in supermarkets, then colonized the heights of the publishing industry bestseller lists from the 1960s onwards.) American SF was bootstrapped by a publisher feeding an engineering subculture with adverts for tools and components. There was an implicit ideology attached to this strain of science fiction right from the outset: the American Dream of capitalist success, mashed up with progress through modern technology, and a side-order of frontier colonialism. It's not a coincidence that the boom in planetary romances occured shortly after the American frontier was finally closed: the high frontier had a natural appeal and gradually replaced the western frontier in the popular imagination. (As futurist and SF author Karl Schroeder remarks, every technology has political implications. If you have automobiles you will inevitably find out that you need speed limits, drunk driving laws, vehicle and driver licensing to ensure the cars and their drivers are safe ... and then jaywalking laws, the systematic segregation of pedestrians and non-automotive traffic from formerly public spaces, air pollution, and an ongoing level of deaths and injuries comparable to a small war. You also get diversion of infrastructure spending from railways to road building, and effective limits on civil participation by non-drivers. The new radio enthusiast magazine readers Gernsback was cultivating didn't ask about the politics of radio, although it would come back to bite them in the 1930s with increased regulation, then state censorship and the use of wireless broadcasts for wartime propaganda. They were just having fun and maybe trying to build a local radio repair shop. But there's been a tendency in American SF, ever since those early days, to be wilfully blind to the political implications of the shiny toys.) There is a darker element to this era of science fiction. Gernsback's publishing empire arose around the time the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his Manifesto of Futurism (in 1909). Futurism was an explicitly ideological program—an artistic movement that rejected of the past and celebrated speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry, and argued for the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of the Italian state. In 1918 Marinetti founded a Futurist Party, but a year later it merged with Benito Mussolini's movement, and Marinetti is credited as the co-author of the Fascist Manifesto of 1919. Hugo Gernsback didn't consciously bring fascism into American SF, but the field was open to it by the 1930s. Possibly the most prominent contributor to far right thought in American science fiction was the editor John W. Campbell. Campbell edited Astouding Science Fiction, one of Amazing Stories rivals, from 1937 until 1971. (Astounding is still with us today, having changed its name to Analog in 1960.) Campbell discovered or promoted many now-famous authors, including Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, E. E. Smith, and Jack Williamson. But Campbell was also an anti-communist red-baiter. He was overtly racist, an anti-feminist, and left his imprint on the genre as much by what he didn't publish as by what he did—and how he edited it. For example, Tom Godwin's classic short story The Cold Equations was sent back with editorial change requests three times before Godwin finally gave Campbell the ending he wanted: one that, as Cory Doctorow put it, turned the story \"into a parable about the foolishness of women and the role of men in guiding them to accept the cold, hard facts of life\". Later in his career, Campbell fell victim to just about every pseudoscientific grift that was going. (If he was alive today he'd probably be selling NFTs.) He had a weakness for perpetual motion machines, was an enthusiast for Dianetics (which L. Ron Hubbard later turned into the Church of Scientology), and he was a firm believer in paranormal powers -- telepathy, telekinesis, and astral projection, (all now thoroughly disproven by research at the Koestler Institute of Parapsychology). (Confirmation bias may have been at work here: a belief in psi powers implicitly supports an ideology of racial supremacy, and indeed, that's about the only explanation I can see for Campbell's publication of the weirder stories of A. E. Van Vogt.) Campbell wasn't the only wellspring of right-wing thought in golden age SF. No quick tour would be complete without mentioning Ayn Rand, the Russian emigre and bestselling author who invented the far right philosophy of Objectivism. This centred (quote) \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\". Reason which, of course, was positioned as emotionless, neutral, factually grounded, and thereby exempt from accusations of bias and subjectivity. Rand held that the only social system compatible with this obviously-correct philosophy was laissez-faire capitalism: you can probably see why this appeals to sociopathic billionaires and their fans. Perhaps the weirdest ingredient in the mix of ideas that gave rise to what became known in the 1990s as the Californian Ideology is Russian Cosmism, the post-1917 stepchild of the mystical theological speculation of a Russian Orthodox theologian, Nikolai Fyodorovitch Fyodorov. The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy is your one-stop shop for batshit philosophers who unduly influenced the space program and gave rise to modern Transhumanism. As it notes: \"Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov (born 1829, died 1903), was founder of an immortalist (anti-death) philosophy emphasizing \"the common task\" of resurrecting the dead through scientific means.\" The illegitimate son of a Russian prince, Federov grew up a devout Russian Orthodox Christian. He worked as a librarian and as a teacher, and through his writings he was the formative influence on the Russian cosmists, a Russian philosophical movement that prefigured transhumanism (and specifically extropianism). The cosmists in turn influenced Tsiolkovsky, who was a major inspiration for Soviet attitudes to space exploration. \"Fedorov found the widespread lack of love among people appalling. He divided these non-loving relations into two kinds. One is alienation among people: 'non-kindred relations of people among themselves.' The other is isolation of the living from the dead: 'nature's non-kindred relation to men.'\" ... \"A citizen, a comrade, or a team-member can be replaced by another. However a person loved, one's kin, is irreplaceable. Moreover, memory of one's dead kin is not the same as the real person. Pride in one's forefathers is a vice, a form of egotism. On the other hand, love of one's forefathers means sadness in their death, requiring the literal raising of the dead.\" Federov believed in a teleological explanation for evolution, that mankind was on a path to perfectibility determined by god: human mortality was the biggest sign of our imperfection. He argued that the struggle against death would give all humanity a common enemy -- and a victory condition that could be established, in the shape of (a) achieving immortality for all, and (b) resurrecting the dead to share in that immortality. Quite obviously immortality and resurrection for all would lead to an overcrowded world, so Federov also advocated colonisation of the oceans and space: indeed, part of the holy mission would inevitably be to bring life (and immortal human life at that) to the entire cosmos. (The wikipedia article on Federov discusses his transhumanist program in somewhat more detail than the IEP entry.) The final word probably deserves to go to Nicholas Berdyaev (secondary source here) who in 1928 wrote, in a collection of liturgical essays on the Orthodox church: The novelty of Fedorov's idea, one which frightens so many people, lies in the fact that it affirms an activity of man incommensurably greater than any that humanism and progressivism believe in. Resurrection is an act not only of God's grace but also of human activity. We now come to the most grandiose and bewildering idea of N. Fedorov. He had a completely original and unprecedented attitude towards apocalyptic prophecies, and his doctrine represents a totally new phenomenon in Russian consciousness and Russian apocalyptic expectation. Never before in the Christian world had there been expressed such an audacious, such an astounding concept, concerning the possibility of avoiding the Last Judgement and its irrevocable consequences, by dint of the active participation of man. If what Fedorov calls for is achieved, then there will be no end to the world. Mankind, with a transformed and definitively regulated nature, will move directly into the life eternal. I'm going to confess, at this point, to having in my youth read translations of Tsiolkovsy's writing, but not Federov—he was relatively obscure in the west until recently. The forebears of the American space program—Robert Goddard, Jack Parsons, and of course Wernher Von Braun—also read Tsiolkovsky. And through their writings, his plans for space colonization (and the ideas of Russian cosmism) leaked directly into the minds of science fiction authors like Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, and Arthur C. Clarke. Finally, I haven't really described Rationalism. It's a rather weird internet mediated cult that has congealed around philosopher of AI Eliezer Yudkowski over the past decade or so. Yudkowski has taken on board the idea of the AI Singularity—that we will achieve human-equivalent intelligence in a can, and it will rapidly bootstrap itself to stratospheric heights of competence and render us obsolete—and terrified himself with visions of paperclip maximizers, AIs programmed to turn the entire universe into paperclips (or something equally inhospitable to human life) with maximum efficiency. He and his followers then dived into a philosophical rabbit maze of trying to reason their way into minimizing harms arising from a technology that does not yet exist and may not even be possible. (In contrast, Nick Bostrom focussed on the philosophical implications of digitizing human brains so we can all be raptured up to live in the great cloud computer in the sky, a very modern riff on the Christian eschatological theory of resurrection.) American SF from the 1950s to the 1990s contains all the raw ingredients of what has been identified as the Californian ideology (evangelized through the de-facto house magazine, WIRED). It's rooted in uncritical technological boosterism and the desire to get rich quick. Libertarianism and it's even more obnoxious sibling Objectivism provide a fig-leaf of philosophical legitimacy for cutting social programs and advocating the most ruthless variety of dog-eat-dog politics. Longtermism advocates overlooking the homeless person on the sidewalk in front of you in favour of maximizing good outcomes from charitable giving in the far future. And it gels neatly with the Extropian and Transhumanist agendas of colonizing space, achieving immortality, abolishing death, and bringing about the resurrection (without reference to god). These are all far more fun to contemplate than near-term environmental collapse and starving poor people. Finally, there's accelerationism: the right wing's version of Trotskyism, the idea that we need to bring on a cultural crisis as fast as possible in order to tear down the old and build a new post-apocalyptic future. (Tommasso Marinetti and Nick Land are separated by a century and a paradigm shift in the definition of technological progress they're obsessed with, but hold the existing world in a similar degree of contempt.) The hype and boosterism of the AI marketers collided with the Rationalist obsession in the public perception a couple of weeks ago, in the Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit at Bletchley Park. This conference hatched the Bletchley Declaration, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. It featured Elon Musk being interviewed by Rishi Sunak on stage, and was attended by Kamala Harris, vice-president of the United States, among other leading politicians. And the whole panicky agenda seems to be driven by an agenda that has emerged from science fiction stories written by popular entertainers like me, writers trying to earn a living. Anyway, for what my opinion is worth: I think this is bullshit. There are very rich people trying to manipulate investment markets into giving them even more money, using shadow puppets they dreamed up on the basis of half-remembered fictions they read in their teens. They are inadvertently driving state-level policy making on subjects like privacy protection, data mining, face recognition, and generative language models, on the basis of assumptions about how society should be organized that are frankly misguided and crankish, because there's no crank like a writer idly dreaming up fun thought experiments in fictional form. They're building space programs—one of them is up front about wanting to colonize Mars, and he was briefly the world's richest man, so we ought to take him as seriously as he deserves—and throwing medical resources at their own personal immortality rather than, say, a wide-spectrum sterilizing vaccine against COVID19. Meanwhile our public infrastructure is rotting, national assets are being sold off and looted by private equity companies, their social networks are spreading hatred and lies in order to farm advertising clicks, and other billionaires are using those networks to either buy political clout or suck up ever more money from the savings of the poor. Did you ever wonder why the 21st century feels like we're living in a bad cyberpunk novel from the 1980s? It's because these guys read those cyberpunk novels and mistook a dystopia for a road map. They're rich enough to bend reality to reflect their desires. But we're not futurists, we're entertainers! We like to spin yarns about the Torment Nexus because it's a cool setting for a noir detective story, not because we think Mark Zuckerberg or Andreesen Horowitz should actually pump several billion dollars into creating it. And that's why I think you should always be wary of SF writers bearing ideas.

Thought provoking. At first, the essay appeared to be about how a few great men have powerfully influenced the world through fiction. Then it seemed to be about how the invisible hand has led us to dystopia. But throughout there is the idea that we could have behaved differently. It brings to mind a metaphor of culture formation. A raindrop falling on the continental divide could end up either in the Pacific or the Atlantic because of a tiny difference of position. And its path is both influenced by topography and creates it by deepening existing pathways. Your article seems to be a call to action, but can we raindrops have choice? I'm fascinated by deadly technology and at the same time I believe that all people deserve a life of dignity and agency. Thinking about awful things probably deepens those pathways. Dark things are way more interesting than peace and love. I guess I like thinking about the former but experiencing the latter.

Consider solving large sets of linear equations, searching for large primes, etc.; protein folding is merely a more complicated example of such tasks. But nobody serious ever called that actual intelligence; that came later, when some ambitious second- and third-rate academics took over much of computer science. Life extension is similar. For slightly shameful reasons, I have just read a 'brain ship' novel (no names - no pack drill) - oh, God, oh, America! Absolutely NO WAY is the brain even resistant to aging, and the scientifically estimated limit of about 120 years applies to that. Yes, there is reason to hope to 'eliminate' Parkinson's and possibly dementia as such, but the gradual decay isn't limited to those, and there are solid theoretical reasons to believe that it is unavoidable. That ignores the body lifetime issues, which are similar.

As for whether or not LLMs are AI, that gives me pause because I've dabbled in this field a time or two. There's a joke amongst AI researchers that once an AI problem is solved, it's no longer AI. This is due, in part, to the problem of not being able to define intelligence. Perhaps we're all stochastic parrots, but merely so advanced that we can't recognize this in ourselves. Nonetheless, even if LLMs are AI-snake oil, they're already putting a lot of people out of work. I've been a software engineer for decades and I'm pretty good at it, and I find this work scary and it's only in its infancy. It used to be that labor-saving technology would free workers up to do work only humans could do (after the inevitable pain of the phase transition which saw people homeless and starving), but at least there was a way forward. Today, we see an existential threat where there may well be less work available that only humans can do.

The term became acceptable again around the mid-80s, and exploded as a marketing gimmick with the generalization of the deep neural networks.

Robert Prior replied to this comment from OvidNovember 10, 2023 17:20Reply 17: Today, we see an existential threat where there may well be less work available that only humans can do. Back in the 50s there was a lot of noise around the impending problem of too much leisure time. With increasing automation in factories, however would people occupy their days when they only had to work 30 hours a week, or maybe only 20? We all know how it turned out: those in control cut the workforce (rather than hours) and kept the productivity gains for themselves. There were other paths available (including Mack Reynolds' People's Capitalism) but we (as a society) didn't take them. In my more cynical moments, I think that those in control are deliberately preserving the only form of human work that won't be replaced by machines: being proper subservient minions for those in control to feel superior to. As someone relatively recently retired, it's nice not to have to work, but to have time for the things I truly want to do. Experiments with universal basic income have shown that people still work, they are just pickier about their working conditions (having the audacity to want a meaningful job where they are treated decently). This seems to be at odds with what the techlords want, which is retinues of servants jumping to their every whim and telling them how great they are.

Psi was usually presented as a hereditable trait, so two psis having children would have greater odds of those children being psi (and possibly stronger psi than their parents). Psi powers were also generally seen as good, and controlled by the psis themselves being moral people, or possibly by a psi-police of stronger moral psis. Not always, and some writers inverted the tropes, but it was pretty obvious even to teenage me that a lot of the psi societies in SF had those who by natural abilities were best suited to rule the rest.

I think scientific theories are a pretty thorough debunking of the idea that all humans are stochastic parrots. There are numerous examples of theories predicting things which had not been observed at the time of formulation, but were later found to match what the theory predicted. The instances I can think of off the top of my head are several elements predicted based on holes in the periodic table, and particles predicted by quantum mechanics.

I can easily believe there were some idiotic USA academics in the 1950s as well as in the 1980s onwards, but that was before my time. There were people investigating leads that they felt might, eventually, lead to true machine intelligence, but they never deluded themselves that what they were doing was even a poor approximation. Look at what Edinburgh were doing in the 1960s, for a start. There were others I had contact with, but Edinburgh were the leaders in this area. https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/60-years-of-computer-science-and-ai/highlights-of-edinburgh-computer-science-and-ai https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai/history-of-ai-edinburgh moonshadowNovember 10, 2023 18:21Reply 25: The grain of truth behind \"AI safety\" is that \"AI\" is a statistical model - essentially a black box - that does whatever is on the curve that best fit its training set, and that thing is often not what any sane person would actually want. The extent of any risk is precisely the extent to which we let AI cause physical effects in the real world. When it produces an image with a few too many fingers, we laugh and move on.

I can't see that the proportion of racist stories about psi is any higher than those about demagogocracy or capitalism being the only good forms of society, or the superiority of humans in space opera with humans vs aliens. PSI is no different from any other purported human ability, and basic evolution shows that a 'superior' race will necessarily emerge at some stage. The only way to stop it would by fascist restrictions on the breeding of the exceptional people (a standard trope in this area), and I fail to see that is morally any different for breeding FOR the trait. There are also stories where it is no different from mathematical or physical ability (e.g. The Demolished Man), and so on. To conflate The Chrysalids with Slan is grossly unfair on Wyndham.

Even accepting the premise that there's \"no margin for error\" it's a flawed story. If fuel was that tight, by the time the stowaway was discovered the mission was already doomed; the damage was done. I remember a similar short story from Heinlein (in The Green Hills of Earth anthology?) where a child stows away on a Moon flight ... After first jettisoning baggage & cargo and finding it's still not enough, the hero pilot comes through by recalculating the required engine burns on the fly ... Heinlein as an author does seem to recognize that the damage is already done by the time the stowaway is discovered.

I just reread The Stars My Destination and I'd say that's tear-the-roof-off anarchism. Heinlein's Red Planet has a revolution against a greedy, irresponsible company, and is probably interesting about the politics of putting a revolution together. He was also interesting about mostly side-lining esp as a useful skill that doesn't lead to an elite. \"Telek\" by Vance is a rare example about psychic powers being given to the public, but we don't see the resulting society.

But if you were also peripherally involved with the music scene, the whole CCRU thing was interesting - to my mind, very much a modern update on COUM. At the time, they were still nominally leftist ( the Living Marxism crowd were also pushing something akin to accelerationism) and I don’t think Land had discovered his blend of Nietzsche and machine god cultism yet. But it was pretty much impossible to believe anyone would take this nonsense seriously, beyond the few music journalists who liked to talk about Baudrillard.

Thanks. ElaineNovember 10, 2023 21:16Reply 37: Libertarianism / Objectivism - I was introduced to game theory in a \"maths camp\" kind of thing in my final year of high school (where they were trying to excite would-be university maths students about the possibilities; we got the theory behind public-key crypto too, it was interesting). Twenty years later, studying economics and legislation for an environmental management masters, we got game theory again, this time as immortalised in The Beautiful Mind; there is a game-theoretical justification for e.g. environmental legislation to maximise the outcome (or utility or whatever your philosophical definition of \"good\" is) for each individual in society, if they accept a slightly higher cost to themselves. In this instance, selfishness not only causes pollution but encourages everyone else to pollute and ruins the environment for everyone including the selfish individual, collapsing the result to the worst outcome over time. Mind blown: I had been raised Catholic and could not reconcile the fact that the Golden Rule (do unto others, etc.) clearly works in an ethical society, with the claim that it takes a punitive deity to make it work. Here was my completely secular proof, mathematical and everything. Also demonstrated that the \"tragedy of the commons\" was a libertarian fable (completely ahistorical and made up in the sixties as it turns out). So when someone claims that it's only rational to be completely selfish, devil take the hindmost, etc, I know that they are a bigoted parasite, claiming a justification for their selfishness that they don't understand. Ayn Rand ended her life on welfare, by the way. (Do I sound angry? perhaps I am.) The long-termists also don't understand basic economics*, in the form of Net Present Value. Because money depreciates and the value of investments accumulates, it is better to make investments now in social infrastructure than to neglect them in favour of some nebulous future project. If they want to colonise the universe in the future there will be a greater surplus to do it with if they build up society now**. Robert Heinlein understood this - one of his books, The Day After Tomorrow had that as the basis for a universal basic income; not something that the RAH-RAHs tend to obsess over. I think it would be fascinating to push this set of principles among a generation of geeks, perhaps by stories, games and movies where co-operation saves the day against the individualists, fascists and oligarchs. It's why I think the ending of The Postman was a cop-out, and I wonder about the Deep Space Nine version of the Federation, although that might have been influenced by the Culture Special Circumstances division. There again, I think maybe co-operation has become a harder sell to producers and publishers, wonder why? *Economics is not difficult to understand, It's just been obfuscated by academics and hijacked by political hacks. I saw Bloody Stupid Johnson scoff once that you couldn't raise taxes because of the Laffer Curve - that sounds impressive until you know that it's only true when taxes are above 70%. And the household, \"tighten our belts\" analogy for economies is a complete lie; an economy is a closed cycle and money is best viewed as the circulatory fluid.

In the late 60s Minsky and Pappert “proved” that neural nets couldn’t be generalized to perform arbitrary logic operations, so connectionism was unfundable until Hinton, et al, showed that it could be generalized just by adding extra layers. Now “AI” is largely synonymous with neural nets. In between Minsky and Hinton funding wars broke out between “neats” and “scruffies”, but nobody remembers what those are anymore.

There’s a lot I want to say about this, but instead I’m enjoying seeing a lot of people who normally lurk showing up. Moar pleez! But I can’t resist two modest suggestions: I DO NOT create a SF world you don’t want to end up living in. No, “But it’s so cooool!” is not an adequate excuse. Just remember Buddhism’s first Noble Truth, the one every thoughtful person agrees with: Life Is Unsatisfactory. No matter how nice your world is, things about it is going to seriously suck for everybody sometime, because it’s still gonna be innately unsatisfactory. That’s an infinite source of story fodder. No need to give rich sociopaths more ideas. Better to imagine worlds without them maybe? B. DO NOT write cautionary stories in any genre. Too many people take them as recipes and planning documents, not warnings. This includes nonfiction, where Barbarians At The Gate was written as a cautionary story and became the how-to book for a generation of corporate raiders. That’s enough time on my little soap box.

No amount of automation keep things from working perfectly forever. In the back of my mind I keep thinking of Elon's failed attempt to automate EVERYTHING about the assembly of Teslas.

You cannot overcome all obstacles, and the universe not only doesn&#x27;t care about your hard work and positive attitude, but is utterly unaware of and unaffected by your very existence. Life, nature, the universe all do what they do and no matter how hard you try, you can only influence things.

A greedy, short-sighted, incredibly dumb optimization system, but it has scale on its side. Which is why we are, for example, dealing with \"superbugs\" now. Life found a way around some of our antibiotics[1]. But this doesn&#x27;t mean antibiotics were a mistake. It means we need to do better, one-up life again.

Reality is under no such obligations.The issue arises when people try to shape the future and one another in ways that depend on these faulty predictions.

I found the first interpretation to be more comforting. reply ChainOfFools 14 hours agorootparentB&B was created by Mike Judge, who also gave us Idiocracy, which shows us pretty clearly where his head was at in both cases. The point of the show was partly stoner humor sandwiched in between video music segments on the then-new MTV channel. It&#x27;s not exactly high art, but it is quite obviously intended as satire by the creator of the show. The intended audience point of view is not that of B&B, who are deliberately presented in such extreme absurdity in order to be unrelatable. The viewer is expected to see B&B the way the straight-man(ish) characters of the show do, as tiresome unfunny nuisances or worse, lacking any sense of self-awareness. Although it could be seen as being sympathetic to the characters themselves, especially given the much greater amount of screen time they get, this may have been simply necessary in order to secure protracted attention from the large fraction of juvenile manchildren in the original MTV audience, whom the show had to ensure it didn&#x27;t turn off even as it was trolling them specifically.I think especially since idiocracy came out, it&#x27;s evident that B&B was in part a crude attempt at social engineering, a gentle way to grant the sort of people who might find themselves symathizing with the main characters the crucial power those characters lacked, which was to see themselves from the outside.

It just appears as though there is no conflict to outsiders.There was a solarpunk-ish epoch in the game Chrono Trigger (Zeal). Everything was peaceful and harmonious. This enlightened age was brought down when its scholars researched tech they shouldn&#x27;t and birthed the harbinger of the apocalypse.If there&#x27;s not enough conflict, you&#x27;re not looking close enough at what&#x27;s going on at street level.

Honestly, the speculative part of scifi is the easy part. The credit due these artists is in their fantastic story telling abilities and their world building around the what ifs.

Maybe it&#x27;s all inevitable, but many technologies come around and don&#x27;t look like something described in science fiction.People vaguely predicted the smartphone, but not really. It is not from Star Trek or Gibson. This technology may have been inevitable, but its design, terminology, and effects were not predicted in detail by mainstream sci-fi, and it really did turn out differently.On the other hand, the Humane AI Pin is absolutely a Star Trek: TNG communicator badge. There&#x27;s no denying it. VR and the Metaverse are lifted directly from Neuromancer and Snow Crash. They didn&#x27;t have to end up that way, but they did, because we had those examples in fiction to steer our thinking.It&#x27;s true that predicting things isn&#x27;t as impressive or as important as making them. But many people predict things that don&#x27;t happen, and most people don&#x27;t accurately predict anything.

If tomorrow I decide to dedicate the rest of my life to making the metaverse happen, that&#x27;s just one idiot toiling away. If Zuck decides the same thing, in a few years it might be socially unacceptable to not have fun in the metaverse.Having just a few people have such an outsized influence might still be acceptable, but (and I think this is Stross&#x27; point) they just exhibit such exceptionally bad decision making as to what to focus on that it&#x27;s hard to defend. It may be that there are tons of billionaires that just spend their money on luxury items and the occasional philanthropic venture, and who we don&#x27;t hear much about.

Older people with comorbidities were at higher risk, though survival was still the order of 98%+. The overall mortality was on the order of the 1968 Hong Kong flu, which most people have forgotten. Children especially were never at significant risk. The choice to lock down and do Zoom schooling was at the cost of the youth, which have seen marked declines in academic performance and increases in mental illness. We can see that nations like Sweden which never locked down turned out fine.The virus emerged from Wuhan, where there was the virology lab working on gain of function for coronaviruses. The NIH had funded such research while Fauci was leading the organization. A revolving door between pharmaceutical companies and the FDA helped lead to the suspiciously rushed vaccines, while restricting the release of Pfizer&#x27;s trial data until 2096. The mandates did not make sense since the vaccines were shown to not limit transmission. Given how many boosters some people are on now, they are probably some of the least effective vaccines of all time, compared to the actual good ones for smallpox and polio.Supply chains shattered, or in other words, the trade war that Trump initiated against China had escalated. The virus was the compelling justification to shut down factories, causing supply shocks across the world, demonstrating the foolishness Neoliberal globalist economic policy and just how dependent the West had become on manufacturing based in a hostile totalitarian state.

I&#x27;m not so interested in some pedantic retroactive interpretation of your comment when it&#x27;s clear from the tone and presentation that you intended this to be some reach toward a techno-utopian narrative of progress. My point is that that narrative hides within it the absurd notion that we can&#x27;t do without these things, when obviously we can and it is really quite easy to imagine a pandemic being addressed adequately without those things in place.Indeed in many ways some aspects of the response would have been more robust. I brought up just-in-time because lack of inventory as a buffer (of masks in particular, but also basic necessities) was a huge driver of the virality in the early days. With such a buffer it&#x27;s feasible, plausible even, that we could have weathered the early days easier and anxious people could have had less severe overreactions to mask mandates and the like, and the total death count could have been 10% or 1% what it was without adequate reserves in place. replyhiAndrewQuinn 17 hours agoprevTESCREAL is one of the things I point to when people say e.g. \"Just because I dress in a suit doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m well put together in my daily life.\"Of course wearing a suit and being having a life in order aren&#x27;t strictly casually related.

I would like to expand my Sci-Fi palate. reply BiteCode_dev 19 hours agoparentThe modern answer to that are probably books like \"the three body problems\". Also old French science fiction can be excellent, e.g: anything Barjavel. Not to mention there are always UK outliers, like Douglas Adams.But personally, I&#x27;d say Bande dessinée, the European cousin of comic books, is where you will find the most untapped underrated wonders.Anything Moebius or Jodoroski, like \"L&#x27;Incal\" or \"La caste des Meta-barons\" is truly special. The aesthetics have a lot of personality, the writing is messed up, and the world building is all kind of twisted and provoking.The main problem is that they sometimes take you for a whole run then end up nowhere. But the ride is awesome, and some of it has left scars inside me, I&#x27;m not kidding. And it has been translated to English.Even without aiming for extremes, you&#x27;ll find all kind of fun stuff.Like \"Aldébaran\" that really sells this sense of discovery of new exotic places with a rag tag expedition, like African jungles in the past, but on new planets. It&#x27;s a big saga too.\"Sillage\" that packs your read with a futuristic black window amidst a galactic political turmoil.Bilal&#x27;s immortal trilogy giving the Egyptian alien concept some wind.Or \"Le gipsy\" for a no brain adventure with a truck driver coasting on a road that wraps around the entire world.It&#x27;s crazy to me that given the lack of creativity of Hollywood they scrap everything they can from books and even mangas or video games, but they rarely attack this treasure.Plus those SF master pieces have equally good fantasy sisters. reply creer 14 hours agorootparentA problem with Barjavel - as I remember it - is the stylization of the stories: there is little detail, little background, little world ambiance in these books. Just a one big story. And that makes them paraboles or something - exercises about ONE idea. And not worlds.In something like L&#x27;Incal on the contrary, the world around the story is very rich. In the way the Neuromancer world is rich. There is not JUST the story going on. It goes on in front and in the middle of a richness of OTHER ideas.

On this date the Unix Time Stamp will cease to work due to a 32-bit overflow. Before this moment millions of applications will need to either adopt a new convention for time stamps or be migrated to 64-bit systems which will buy the time stamp a \"bit\" more time.

It is as a direct result of that book that I now know without having to look it up that a ksec is about a quarter hour and a Msec is on the order of a fortnight, which comes in handy when doing back-of-envelope estimation more often than you&#x27;d expect.

It&#x27;s not \"liberal progressive\" or \"traditional conservative\" or \"libertarian\". Or any other popular political ideology. It&#x27;s certainly authoritarian, but uniquely so. It&#x27;s almost a dystopia run by project managers and exploiting specialists.Also a fun bit: The traders in the book count base their epoch on the first moon landing, but if you pay attention, the lowest levels of software count from a different epoch. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 1 hour agorootparentThey merely got confused... thousands of years from now, they assume unix epoch time is based on the moon landing. And it&#x27;s only a few months off anyway. Not much is left of Earth as far as they know, to be able to properly understand that those were two different events.The Emergents are what they are, because they are, at the most fundamental level, busybodies who want to control others. Sometime in their own history, they found an excuse (the Emergency) to do that, and they never stopped doing it even after the crisis was over. In this way they map to most other authoritarian regimes in reality, but especially to the leftist authoritarian regimes. They hate \"peddlers\" after all, who sell things to others at fair prices and of their own free will. Not unlike the mutterings you see all over social media concerning capitalism. reply tekla 11 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds more like a \"The Giver\" style distopia reply jefftk 9 hours agorootparentSpoiling the joke, but the Emergents are very clearly dystopian and NoMoreNicksLeft knows it ;)Definitely give the book a read!

Common number bases are 10, 16, maybe 8 if you live in the 70s, and 2.Except for the utterly unwieldy binary, none of those bases adapt well to the bases used in representing time, which are mostly the (partially related) bases 60, 12, and, annoyingly, thirty-ish.So you always end up doing opaque arithmetic instead of “just looking at the digits” (which you still can do in decimal for century vs years for example, because we defined centuries to be exactly that). reply PrimeMcFly 13 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;ve always loved the idea of measuring time in computers by a single integer like the timestamp doesWhy? reply SirMaster 6 hours agoprevWhen did Unix time start being used?Was it being used in 1970 and actually started at 0?Or did they just pick a date to start it and if so what was the initial Unix time when it was first used? reply leonidasv 4 hours agoparent>The Unix epoch is midnight on January 1, 1970.

    "originLink": "https://www.jeffwofford.com/?p=2089",
    "originBody": "Posted on November 9, 2023November 10, 2023 by Jeff How to Boss Without Being Bossy Leaders command people. That’s kind of what a leader is: someone with the authority to direct the actions of others. But people don’t often appreciate being commanded. When you step into leadership you face this challenge: how do you direct the members of your team without offending them? How do you become a good boss, but not be “bossy”? It’s worth starting this discussion with the reminder that most of what bosses do isn’t bossing at all. Although a leader can tell people what to do, we should be slow to do so. Most team discussions are dynamic and interactive. They should involve everyone without imposing much hierarchy. As a team we cultivate ideas. We imagine solutions. We consider potential tasks. We settle on a plan. The best work happens when the whole team is involved in understanding the problem, the chosen solution, and each person’s role in making it happen. Then each member has the knowledge and ownership to handle tasks skillfully and with passion. The leader’s primary job is to nurture this discussion, to make sure there is a divergence of options and then a convergence to a solid choice. Often this leadership involves no “bossing” at all. But sometimes we should and must tell people what to do. Sometimes people need the clarity, the unambiguity of a direct instruction. Sometimes we do assign tasks. “You do this.” We should rarely say it like that. Usually there are better ways to give a command, ways that make our purpose clear while honoring and respecting the listener. It is possible to issue a command without it feeling like a command. Even the word “command” can feel abrasive. But I’m going to use that term in this article. Technically, if you as a person in authority direct someone else to perform a task, you are commanding them. The question we’ll answer today, then, is: how do you give a command in a way your team members will accept, won’t reject as “bossy,” and might even feel good about? We’re going to focus on words. When you know you have to give a command (or directive or instruction or assignment), what words should you use? Body language matters too. Tone of voice matters. The conversation that surrounds the command—what comes before and after—matters a lot. But today let’s dive into the nitty-gritty. What are the best words to use? Here’s a couple of examples. “Get this done!” That’s pretty harsh. Maybe sometimes this level of directness is necessary, but it’s no way to win friends or influence people. “Do you think we could maybe see about possibly…” That’s pretty cagey. You may come across sounding weak, and your directive may get lost. The English language offers a wealth of options for how to give a command. Let’s look at them and consider which work best in this or that situation and which, if any, are never good for any situation. We’ll consider the example of telling someone to take out the trash—something most of us have been asked or told to do at some point. We’ll consider different ways you might command someone to take out the trash, see how it feels, and consider how clear the command is and how harsh it may feel. Command forms plotted against clarity and harshness From this menu of command forms you can build your own style of how, when the occasion warrants, you direct members of your team to do things. A Taxonomy of Commands “Take out the trash.” The simplest and most direct way to give a command is to use a straightforward imperative verb. “Drive me to the airport.” “Send me the report by the end of the day.” “Turn in your homework.” These are uncomplicated, bald directives that state the intended action plainly and make no bones about who’s the boss and who’s the bossed. The benefit of using a direct imperative is that your intention is perfectly clear. The listener knows what you want done and who you want to do it. The downside is harshness. Although there are more abrasive ways to give a command (we’ll get to those), the imperative feels pretty in-your-face in most business cultures. Usually (but not always) there’s a better choice. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★★☆ “Please take out the trash.” The word “please” has an interesting and hard-to-define role in English usage. “Please” breaks down hierarchy and puts you on the same footing as your listener. It reaffirms the listener’s choice in the matter. Between friends, family members, and other peers it’s a crucial word, converting a command into an appeal. You must judge for yourself what its effect is on the lips of a leader in a business setting. The effect varies widely based on circumstances and persons. In general it has the advantage of coming across as appealing and polite. It has the disadvantage of not quite making the command definite. “Please” gives the listener an option. Do they really have an option? If the command really is indefinite—if you’re willing for the listener to say “no”—then “please” is just the right word to add. But if the listener is really obligated to obey, “please” might either make everyone feel better by preserving the public honor of the listener—the illusion of choice—or make everyone feel worse by exposing the leader as manipulative. On balance, when giving your listener a real choice, adding “please” makes your request both clearer and more polite. And keep “please” in mind while considering the other forms of command in this list. “Please” can be sprinkled into almost statement with similar, polite-ifying effects as the ones we discovered here. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ “Maybe take out the trash?” With the addition of one little word—”maybe”—and perhaps an upturned note at the end of the sentence to make it a question, the straightforward imperative becomes a much gentler request. The benefit is that you sound less bossy. The downside is that the command has lost its teeth, and the person you’re speaking to may simply ignore you. Leaders who direct others with “maybe” generally appear weak. You might make it work for your leadership style. Probably not. Clarity: ★★☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ “You’d better take out the trash.” Adding “you’d better” to the start of any imperative adds a note of menace, a threat. Whether you say it or not, the phrase “or else…” creeps onto the back of the command. This is almost never a good move. Tossing a threat, however implied, toward someone you want or need to have a lasting relationship with is always counterproductive. The threat weakens the relationship. There’s a further problem: the threat actually weakens the command itself. The fact that you have to invoke “you’d better” to get this person to do something shows that you don’t really have the innate authority to compel them to do it. The threat, not your own leadership, holds the power. With a command like this you might get someone to do something once, but your authority over this person—and anyone observing the exchange—now lives on borrowed time. “You’d better” tends to be the weapon of choice of bullies and demagogues. You’d better avoid it. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★★★★ “You will take out the trash.” One of the English language’s favorite ways of softening an imperative is to turn it into the future tense. On the face of it the future tense looks as if it’s expecting us to predict what the listener will do. “I am Carmac the Magnificent and I foresee that you will…take out the trash!” But we know that in fact this is a directive rather than a prediction, yet a slightly softer directive than the bare imperative. How does it come across to the listener? The answer varies. If you stress the word “will” (or, heaven forbid, transmogrify it to “shall”), the directive is quite harsh and even threatening. But good leaders can say, “You will…” in a calm and inoffensive tone and convey a sense of solidity rather than threat. “What you’re going to do is to get the kitchen cleaned up. After that you’ll take out the trash.” In effect they’re directing: “Get the kitchen cleaned up. After that, take out the trash.” But the future tense with the proper tone comes across a little more gently. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★★☆ “I want you to take out the trash.” To my ear this is slightly gentler than a stark, “Take out the trash,” but tone of voice can make all the difference. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★★☆ “I need you to take out the trash.” The differences between these various ways of asking someone to do something may strike you as overly subtle, but often a grain of change can make a heap of difference. The shift here from “want” to “need” makes this command much more forceful, yet without seeming particularly harsh. “I need you to…” is a very popular way of commanding. Many leaders prefer it over any other form. I’ve even seen it taught in assertiveness training classes. The reason it works so well is that it makes an appeal to the listener that is very forceful yet neither threatening nor invasive. In essence you’re asking for help: “I have this need, you see? Would you meet my need?” It’s not you that demands so loudly that this person obey your request, it’s your need that makes the demand. “I have this need, and you can help me meet my need by doing this.” The phrase “I need you to” gives the directive a softer, less “bossy” quality than some alternatives. Yet it is forceful. A listener will find it very difficult to evade this form of command. To do so they must in essence respond with, “No, you don’t need that.” That kind of response takes brass. It means making a higher claim about your needs than you yourself are making. The listener must say, in effect, “You say that you need me to do that, but you’re wrong. What you really need is….” Only a very well-informed and knowledgable—or else stupid and insubordinate—listener will reply like this. Sometimes it is the right reply, and if you as a leader are telling people that you need them to do something, you’d better actually need it. This is a bluff that can be called. In normal circumstances “I need you to…” is a tried-and-true way of issuing a command that carries great force without seeming excessively harsh, and is therefore quite common. Clarity: ★★★★★ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ (and yet forceful) “Would you mind taking out the trash?” Here is one of the most common—and grammatically vexing—of English request forms, but also among the most effective. The fact that the listener must answer with “no” in order to agree to your request never ceases to befuddle. As with adding “please” to a request, “would you mind” softens by transforming a demand into a plea. It is virtually illegal, culturally speaking, to answer with “yes,” as if you minded (even if you would). Instead the listener is obligated to refuse the request in some more deliberate way: “Well, actually I’m tied up just now” or something similar. Consequently this is one of those magic request forms (like “I need you to…”) that applies more force with less harshness. “Would you mind” gives a less clear command than the bare imperative in that the user may refuse. The “answer yes by saying no” twisteroo also adds a little mental complication. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ “I‘m going to get you to take out the trash.” By prefacing the imperative with several filler words, we dull the edge of the command while keeping the meaning fairly clear (though not as clear as the bare imperative). There’s not much mistaking what is supposed to be done or who is to do it, yet a little wiggle room has been left to the listener. Several of the phrases on this list use this technique: make the command longer to make it less harsh, but also less clear. Personally I find this phraseology irritating. It can perhaps feel more gentle than a bare imperative but it also sounds more toadying and manipulative. For my own preference, a leader tempted to hedge with “I’m going to get you to…” would do better to skip the rigmarole and just say what they want. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★★☆☆ “I’ll let you take out the trash.” Another softening-by-lengthening technique, now with the added twist of implying that the listener wants to do the task. To me it sounds manipulative, but it has the further disadvantage of lost clarity. The listener may reply (mentally or aloud), “You’re letting me? So if I don’t want to, I don’t have to?” The task may not get done, and you as leader won’t have much of an excuse for why you didn’t make your requirement clearer. Clarity: ★★★☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “I’d like for the trash to be taken out.” It’s remarkable how often you’ll hear phrases like this in meetings at every level of an organization. A leader knows what they want done and who they want to do it, but by omitting the subject of the command—“you”—they hope to make it less bossy. Indeed, they hope the listener will reply, “Okay, I’ll take out the trash.” Sometimes this works. More often, everyone sits on their hands, waits for the moment to pass, and the command is ambiguously lost as the meeting moves on. There is a time for leaders to suggest a task and allow followers to volunteer to take it on. But it’s best to make that dance explicit. “Somebody needs to take the trash out. Who’ll do it?” Trying to hedge your command as an invitation for volunteerism is usually just weak and ineffective. If you know that you’re speaking to John, and everyone knows that you’re speaking to John, then speak to John. Don’t imply commands. Clarity: ★★☆☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Will you/Would you take out the trash?” On the face of it, it looks as if the English language, by offering this form of request, is inviting the listener to proclaim a prophetic oracle. A cheeky reply would be, “I don’t know whether I’ll take out the trash—am I supposed to be able to see the future?” In reality, of course, the future tense of the verb is a softer way to frame an imperative mood. Phrasing the command in the form of a question softens it further. The question implies—truly or falsely—that the listener has a choice. This is a good and of course very common way of asking people to do things, quite clear and not terribly harsh. Your parents and teachers probably used it with you. Don’t be too shy about using it with your team. Clarity: ★★★★☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Could you/Can you take out the trash?” Likewise, “could you/can you” feels slightly quaint, almost archaic, and holds a note of appeal (as opposed to command) that might work well for your style of leadership. Or not. Something to experiment with? Clarity: ★★★☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Let’s take out the trash.” Another way of softening a command is to put it into the plural first person (“we/us”) instead of the second person (“you”). “Let’s…” is very commonly used by leaders and probably shouldn’t be. It tries to avoid harshness by sacrificing clarity, but usually loses more than it gains. The real subject of the command—you—is hidden, and unless the context has made the subject clear, the command will be lost. When you mean “you,” say “you.” Still, “Let’s…” has its place in a leader’s toolbox, as for example when the person responsible for the task has already been made explicit and the leader’s significant choice is not who will do it but what they will do. In that case, “Let’s take out the trash” may not be a hedging way of saying “You take out the trash,” but rather, “You’ll take out the trash instead of taking out the recycling.” Clarity: ★★☆☆☆ Harshness: ★★☆☆☆ “Why don’t we take out the trash?” Again an overused hedge but not without its place. It is extremely soft but also extremely unclear. Are you actually asking someone to do something? In the middle of an exploratory discussion, asking “why don’t we” or “what if” questions is helpful in cultivating new options or narrowing toward a final choice. But as a final choice, “Why don’t we…” is too cautious and vague. Make a clear choice of who is to do what and then tell them clearly to do it. Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ “Could we take out the trash?” Similar in form and effect to “Why don’t we…?” See the discussion there. Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ “If you would just take out the trash…” Couches the command in the form of an “if” statement, usually with disastrous results. Sometimes leaders let the ellipsis dangle, just like that: “If you would just take out the trash…”—followed by an uncomfortable silence in the room. This is bad. Sometimes they fill the ellipsis with some convenient apodosis: “If you would just take out the trash, we could wash out the bin and maybe it wouldn’t smell so much.” This is equally bad. What little imperative force was implied by the initial “If you would…” becomes lost in the succeeding drivel. “If you would…” simply fails as a means of commanding (or even asking) someone to do something. It stages a desperate ploy to sound less bossy, but still comes across as bossy, yet in an evasive and pandering manner. Avoid it. A common variant has “could” in place of “would.” I don’t see a great difference. Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆ Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆ If you want to be a good boss without being seen as bossy, mull over this list. Watch how other leaders use phrases like these and what effect they have. Try out new ways of issuing commands, see how they feel to you, see how people respond. The key is to find a way of directing people that suits your personality, your team, and your organization’s culture. Once you settle on a comfortable style and make it consistent, then you’ll be seen as a leader who knows how to get people to do things without coming across as obnoxious.

A list of things to do and by when so they can plan out their day and only do what’s necessary yields baseline expected results and frees you to give more attention to team members who do want the freedom to choose their tasks and contribute to strategy, etc.Worst are the people who both don’t like the “I need you to …” task giving and do absolutely nothing when left alone or only given a goal and a direction. How do you deal with it if you are working on an industry where performance adjustments and feedback can take years and you can coast without doing anything four more than a couple of years? reply Paul-Craft 2 hours agorootparentprevI count being horribly disappointed as being surprised, just with the sign reversed. That&#x27;s the risk you have to take as a leader. But, yeah, if it&#x27;s a high stakes, do or die situation, do what needs to be done, even if that&#x27;s something like getting 3 different groups to work on the problem independently, or something.Long term, if you have the right team, the positive surprises will more than cancel out the disappointments and the \"meh\" results. But, if it&#x27;s a life or death type matter, fuck the long term -- you have to survive the short term before you start worrying about that.

I&#x27;d like to see a lot more of that, but the default often seems to be blame.I recall a system at a place I worked where the stakeholders (native or skilled non-native English speakers) would produce requirements by holding meetings with the developer (much less skilled non-native speaker), dictate what they wanted, and have the developer take notes (which the stakeholders would not check) then immediately implement the software.

Good bosses do the shitty and awkward tasks for anyone else to do.When a specific task absolutely needs to be done, the boss asks for volunteers, delegates, or does it themselves in that order.The era of militarist corporations dictating downward, monopolizing information like it&#x27;s some fucking government intelligence agency, and employees bending the knee to inflated egos upward is over.Bosses now are organizational and individual employee facilitators of said employees getting shit done and improvements thereof.Laying out what milestones need to get done and helpful bits to get there without micromanaging.

As a leader, you need to establish a rapport (with someone who is anyway initially inclined to desire rapport with you, because you&#x27;re their boss and have outsize influence over future compensation) and negotiate over high-level context: IC availability and understanding what problems need solving. If everyone understands the problem and there&#x27;s mutual trust, the details take care of themselves.Of course, \"establish mutual trust\" is a whole megillah unto itself.

Looking for the right word is missing the point and to me feels like overanalysing instead of understanding. I&#x27;ve only worked in one manager position but I noticed that different people liked different styles - some want to understand why we&#x27;re doing something and figure out the best way to do it themselves, as it gives them agency and confidence in their abilities - others felt overwhelmed and wanted a more direct approach (do this, in this specific way, in this amount of time) and didn&#x27;t care what the reason was.If your staff knows your character and that you will stand up for them and back their needs in the work place, the phrasing is secondary.

For me the main use is when the team needs for a decision to be made and a debate settled. In a sense I&#x27;m providing a service to the team: I&#x27;m taking the responsibility and blame if things go wrong and removing the need to go around debating in circles.If I&#x27;m giving a command it&#x27;s usually to say confirm some option that other people have suggested and debated like - ok \"so Bob we agree that you&#x27;re going to X and Alice will do Y\".At other times I want to make sure something gets done and I cannot do it or have no time to do it so I give the reason why it needs to get done first, e.g. \"I&#x27;m worried that the QA&#x27;s don&#x27;t understand it enough to be able to test\", so that the person can tell me if I&#x27;m wrong or if there&#x27;s new information and then I say \"could you make sure that the QA&#x27;s know about it?\"If you that you explain you can show that your reasoning can be questioned. Someone might say \"I don&#x27;t know that area well\" or \"I&#x27;m under great pressure to do this other thing\" or they might say \"that isn&#x27;t the way to get what you want\". I find it worth explaining the problem, suggesting solutions and encouraging the other person suggest some - then debating them briefly before making a decision.If you do other things to show an interest in someone and that you care about them a bit then the pill of taking instructions is less. If you can build rapport by finding out what intersts them, get them to talk about themselves - take their HR related requests and other interests seriously.

Bosses don’t just tell people what to do next, it’s a collaborative process and a discussion. The team is aligned on our future goals and there’s a degree of self selecting projects to be assigned to, where the things we work on will flow naturally from our project goals.

At my last position (from which I was unfortunately laid off a few months ago) as a senior staff engineer at a ~100 person startup with a ~30 person engineering org, my manager, the CTO, raised this to an art form. I joked with our other senior staff engineer (whom I hired) that our manager never said anything but \"Figure it out.\" Once, after an eng all hands meeting, I Slacked my colleague and said \"Well, if that wasn&#x27;t peak $CTO-NAME, I don&#x27;t know what is. I&#x27;m pretty sure what I just heard was the 25 minute version of &#x27;figure it out.&#x27;\"\"Figure it out\" is a great message when you have a talented group of engineers working with you. They&#x27;re experts at what they do, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten hired. \"Figure it out\" gives them room to get shit done, and it also goes a long way toward validating any concerns they might express.

As a leader, telling smart, curious, and deeply technical people to \"figure it out\" will get you everything you ever dreamed of and more.The only problem is that if you&#x27;re not careful, you can end up talking too much, which leads to the other half of the lesson: shut the fuck up. Literally just stop talking, and leave some space in the conversation that you&#x27;re not filling up with words. It&#x27;s best if you can stop talking right as you&#x27;ve sketched out the barest outlines of a big idea, or told a good story, or you&#x27;ve just got something that&#x27;s conceptually interesting to drop in the other person&#x27;s lap.Once you do that, \"figure it out\" + interesting idea + \"shut the fuck up\" is just like weaponized nerd sniping. reply siva7 30 minutes agorootparentThose kind of leaders are very rare.

    "title": "Github Type System's Texture Healing Feature Solves Design Issues in Monospace Fonts",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/blob/main/docs/Texture%20Healing.md",
    "originBody": "Texture Healing Documentation Intro Texture Healing is a feature created for the Github Type System series of Monospace fonts, by the team at Lettermatic. These fonts are open-sourced, and so we want to make sure that any future open-source contributors have the opportunity to add their own texture-healed glyphs. The source files for this project are being distributed in Glyphs 3 file format (.glyphs), so this guide assumes you will be using Glyphs.app. However the underlaying concepts can be implemented in any modern font editor. What is the inciting problem? Monospace fonts involve glyphs which inherently have compromise in their design, some of which is unavoidable. Glyphs like ‘i’ that would typically be very narrow in a proportional design, feel quite wide when they are drawn to fit the desired monospace width. Similarly, glyphs like ‘m’ that are normally quite wide, tend to feel very narrow when drawn to fit the monospace constraint (fig. 2). These are largely unavoidable problems, this is simply inherent to the goals of making a monospace latin typeface. fig. 2 I’ve come to think of the ‘m’ example as belonging to a category called ‘glyphs that need space’ (fig. 3). If more space was available, these glyphs would love to take up more space. Somehow anthropomorphizing the glyphs a bit helps to understand the ideas here. fig. 3 And in an inverse but related way, the ‘i’ example could belong to a category called ‘glyphs that can give space’. These glyphs have been given too much, and they’d like to donate some, if given the opportunity. fig. 4 These categories of drawing in a monospace mean that a word like ‘swimming’ and a word like ‘spilling’ have a completely different amount of ‘air’ and ‘density’ to them, just via the nature of the glyph drawings and their coincidental combination in these words. However, there are occasionally situations in which one of these glyphs from the ‘glyphs that need space’ category is coincidentally directly next to a glyph from the ‘glyphs that can give space’ category. And it is these situations, precisely, where the concept of texture healing becomes relevant. Let’s call these situations in which two different compromises are next to each a ‘Texture Conflict’. A good example word would be ‘filming’ (fig. 4) where the ‘lm’ represents the Texture Conflict. Intro to Glyph Variations One of the inherent problems with monospace fonts is, funnily enough, something we take for granted in most typeface design: the idea that there is just one version of every glyph. Disregarding script fonts, for instance, this is true of most fonts. If there is an ‘a’, there is just one unchanging ‘a’ that works in every situation. fig. 6 What if this were not true? Texture Healing relies on the idea that if there is, for instance a default ‘i’, it is also joined by some alternates (fig. 6). Rather than changing the aesthetic styling of the glyph, the glyph construction, or other qualities that typically call for an alternate, Texture Healing relies on alternates that shift to the left and right, without changing the glyph bounds. In other words, the body size of the alternate versions never changes, only the width and positioning of the drawing within the glyph body. The Approach At a high level, the steps of Texture Healing are: Equip the font with variations for letters that are otherwise compromised, in which the compromise is lessened. Equip the font with an awareness of what a Texture Conflict is. Tell the font to swap in alternate glyphs, itself, in the event that they may alleviate a Texture Conflict. But what alternates do we need? Alternates for Glyphs That Can Give Space The letter ‘i’ is in the ‘glyphs that can give space’ category. A Texture Healed font contains, for instance, 3 variations of the letter ‘i’ (fig. 8), each of which have narrower drawings to afford more space. i (default, designed to get along with every other glyph) i.left (narrower drawing, and purposefully sitting to the left of the glyph’s body) i.right (narrower drawing, and purposefully sitting to the right of the glyph’s body) The default version is designed to function just as any monospace would, getting along with every other default glyph in a random order. The alternates, however, are designed to work in very specific contexts, and aren’t suitable to be used in place of defaults. fig. 8 Alternates for Glyphs That Need Space Let’s take another example. Do you remember that ‘m’ belongs to the category we called ‘glyphs that need space’? A texture healed font contains 4 variations of the letter ‘m’ (fig. 9), each of which are: m (default, designed to get along with every other glyph) m.left (wider drawing, and purposefully sitting to the left of the glyph’s body) m.right (wider drawing, and purposefully sitting to the right of the glyph’s body) m.both (the widest drawing variation, purposefully extending to both the left and the right concurrently). With these alternates drawn, how do we make use of them? Why were they made in the first place? fig. 9 Healing Examples In the word ‘filming’, the ‘l’ belongs to the ‘glyphs that can give space’ category, and is followed immediately by an ‘m’ which is in the ‘glyphs that need space’ category. In this situation, there is effectively a needless texture conflict, as these two glyphs (l and m) by default are compromised in inverted ways. What if the ‘l’ could donate some of its excess space to the ‘m’? And the ‘m’ could happily take up that space, to feel less cramped? This sequence of glyphs: f, i, l, m, i, n, g can be replaced with: f, i, l.left, m.left, i, n, g Because the alternate glyphs never take up any more space, on a line of text, than their default siblings, the word length does not change at all, and the monospacing is preserved. However the ‘l’ looks more natural, and the ‘m’ looks less cramped, and the word has become more pleasant to read, as a result. Similar logic could be used for the word ‘winning’. This sequence of glyphs: w, i, n, n, i, n, g can be replaced with: w.right, i.right, n, n, i, n, g Although the direction, this time, is right instead of left, the results are similar in concept: the ‘w’ can now appear wider and therefore a bit more comfortable, and the ‘i’ is narrower which is more typical of an ‘i’ in (for instance) a proportional typeface. Because these changes are happening based on categorical changes, the same logic that swaps ‘wi’ above would also change ‘mi’ in the exact same way. The OpenType Feature Code The fundamentals of the OpenType feature code for Texture Healing involve a series of class definitions (representing the categories described earlier in this documentation), and a series of ‘lookups’, which are triggered in sequence. This code is wrapped within the ‘calt’ feature, meaning Contextual Alternates. This is the same feature often used in, for instance, script fonts to swap a glyph in context when its construction will better suit the preceding or following glyphs. This is a very similar use, just with its own twist. The feature code will be readily available, and thoroughly commented, in the .glyphs file that have been open sourced as part of this project, and naturally I recommend familiarizing yourself with that code. Semantic names have been chosen for the OpenType classes, which reference the categorical concepts we’ve established, for instance you will see definitions for the following classes: @defaults_can_give_space: If a glyph belongs to the ‘glyphs that can give space’ category, and alternates have been drawn for it, the default version should be in this class. For instance ‘i’ belongs here, as the default version of ‘i’. @can_give_space_left: This contains the .left variations of every glyph added to the @defaults_can_give_space class. @can_give_space_right: This contains the .right variations of every glyph added to the @defaults_can_give_space class. A note on OpenType classes: these are sequential containers. The order of elements does matter (very seriously) to the functionality, but the only way to specify an index for an element in the list is its actual order in the typed list. For instance if the ‘i’ is the 6th element in @defaults_can_give_space then the 6th element of @can_give_space_left should be ‘i.left’. The OpenType parser has no way, otherwise, to understand the association between these two glyphs. @defaults_can_take_space: If a glyph belongs to the ‘glyphs that need space’ category, and alternates have been drawn for it, the default version should be in this class. For instance ‘m’ belongs here, as the default version of ‘m’. @can_take_space_left: This contains the .left variations of every glyph added to the @defaults_can_take_space class. @can_take_space_right: This contains the .right variations of every glyph added to the @defaults_can_take_space class. @can_take_space_both: This contains the .both variations of every glyph added to the @defaults_can_take_space class. @stationary: This contains a list of glyphs which are not going to be swapped to alternates, but which should cause other glyphs near them to swap. This will be explained later on. Once these classes are defined, a series of lookups are defined, such as: **lookup** defaultLeftPass { #if a glyph that can take space is to the left of a glyph that can give space, cause the glyph that can give space to extend to the right #sample: im = i.left m; **sub** @defaults_can_give_space' @defaults_can_take_space **by** @can_give_space_left; } defaultLeftPass; Each has been thoroughly commented to describe its purpose, using the # commenting syntax in OpenType feature code. Each contains a ‘#sample’ portion, which shows a hypothetical before/after swap in OpenType (as if the glyphs were hard-coded, when in fact the logic is class-based). You can rely on the code to be self-documenting in this way, as each lookup describes what it does very clearly. Once all the lookups are defined, they are run in a specific order. Each lookup represents a complete pass on the available text when that feature is run, meaning that if the first lookup in the sequence causes glyphs to be swapped, then the second lookup will react to those changes. The consequential change of each lookup is parsed by the following lookup. In Practice: Glyphs That Need Space Let’s follow the process to add a new texture healed glyph. The first thing that we need to decide is, if, indeed, the glyph needs texture healing. Does it feel uncomfortable in the monospace width, even when drawn correctly? Either via feeling too cramped or too airy? fig. 12 Next, you need to sort this glyph into one of our two categories: Is it a ‘glyph that needs space’ or a ‘glyph that can give space’ (fig. 12)? Let’s pretend that we’ve just added the letter ‘m’ to our typeface, and we want to make sure it is texture healed (fig. 13). For the sake of this tutorial we are citing the ‘m’ as an example, but in its place you should imagine any glyph which belongs to the ‘glyphs that need space’ category. We’re going to assume that you’ve already drawn your default version of the ‘m’, which means: the version that can work with every other glyph in the character set, where its width accounts for spacing relationships to arbitrary preceding/following characters. The next step would be to design the ‘.left’ and ‘.right’ versions. For ‘m.left’, the drawing should become wider than the default drawing, but the spacing on the right side should remain identical. In this sense, the ‘m.left’ glyph gets wider, leftwards. fig. 13 The ‘m.right’ variation does the same thing, but this time the left side bearing remains identical, the wider drawing now extends to the right. Still without moving the overall width of the ‘glyph body’ at all. Next you will need an ‘m.both’ variation which is the widest of all the variations, and it extends in both directions. The spacing is no longer the same on either side, and we have a sort of ‘maximum footprint’ version of the glyph via this version. Next up you will need to add your new glyph to the relevant classes. In the case of your ‘m’, it is in the ‘glyphs that need space’ category, and so you would follow these steps: Add the default ‘m’ to the class called @defaults_can_take_space Add ‘m.left’ to @can_take_space_left at the same index position in the sequential list. Add ‘m.right’ to @can_take_space_right at the same index position in the sequential list. Add ‘m.both’ to @can_take_space_both at the same index position in the sequential list. And there you have it! You have a texture healed glyph which will get wider when it neighbors glyphs that can give space. In Practice: Glyphs That Can Give Space If you sorted your glyph into the other category ,‘glyphs that need space’, you will need to follow extremely similar steps, with some small differences. Let’s say that you were adding ‘i’, and therefore it falls into this other category (fig. 15). When creating the .left and .right versions of your glyph, instead of making the drawings wider, the drawings will be narrower. When creating the .left variation, this time the left side bearing will remain the same, and the drawing will ‘scoot over’ to the left, as it gets narrower. fig. 15 The .right version follows the same logic, this time getting narrower rightwards. The bounding box of the glyph, its overall width or ‘body size’ remains the same. There is no .both variation for glyphs in this category, so that can be omitted. And the class sorting steps would be: Add the default ‘i’ to the class called @defaults_can_give_space Add ‘m.left’ to @can_give_space_left at the same index position in the sequential list. Add ‘m.right’ to @can_give_space_right at the same index position in the sequential list. And there we go! You have a texture healed glyph which will get narrower when it neighbors glyphs that need more space.",

The third \"m\" in the \"minimum\" example being narrower than the \"m\"s adjacent to the two \"i\"s makes my brain itch. Same for the \"i\"s in \"miniature\". Makes me feel like I&#x27;m looking through a fish-eye lens, or that my glasses prescription is off. reply mortenjorck 12 hours agoparentI think this all makes a lot more sense when seen in a practical context rather than the blown-up examples in the feature documentation.Take a look at the code editor examples on the main site for Github Monaspace: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monaspace.githubnext.com Scroll down to the \"Five Fonts\" section and try unchecking the texture healing toggle.The fisheye effect you get when looking at the font in 200pt goes away at 16pt, and in the context of a busy code block, has the effect of smoothing out the visual rhythm of the characters with only a minor disruption of the monospace grid. Perhaps it&#x27;s not for everyone (it is a trade-off), but I think it&#x27;s a smart compromise. reply deaddodo 3 hours agorootparentAfter seeing it in a larger context like that, I&#x27;m even more in agreement with OP. The weirdly random letter alignment screws with my brain much more than I thought from just the localized examples in the topic link.I&#x27;ll stick to the consistent design for a slightly less aesthetic experience for that reason alone. reply seanhunter 4 hours agorootparentprevThis might be an autism thing for me but turning on texture healing on that page is so horrible it actually made me flinch.The fact that the \"i\" in \"terminal dimensions\" and the \"i\" in \"width\" aren&#x27;t underneath each other makes it look like my monitor is broken or something. It&#x27;s like someone has done it on purpose to mess with me. reply jrmg 8 hours agorootparentprevI can’t help but think that the example in that page has used ‘timing’ so much to deliberately show off texture healing - it’s a great example because the ‘m’ can expand in both directions and the ‘i’s end up looking the same.I suspect the state where different width variants of the same letter are close to each other would happen a lot more in the real world. reply tobr 12 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a fun innovation and I might try to use it in my terminal, but for coding, the real solution should be obvious: use a proportional font. reply Stratoscope 10 hours agorootparentThis seems to be an unpopular opinion, but proportional fonts are great.One question people sometimes ask is, \"How can you code in a proportional font? How do you line things up in columns?\"The answer is you don&#x27;t. For example, the Black code formatter for Python completely eschews column alignment of this sort: foo.bar(one, two, three)(Imagine that the words were long enough that the whole thing wouldn&#x27;t fit on one line.)Instead, Black formats it like this: foo.bar( one, two, three )No column alignment, only indentation. Code formatted like this is equally readable in a proportional or monospaced font. You don&#x27;t need monospaced fonts!I&#x27;ve read and written all my code in proportional fonts for close to 20 years. My current one is Trebuchet++, a variant of Trebuchet MS that I customized in FontForge.Trebuchet MS is pretty good on its own. For example, all of the \"confusable\" glyphs are easy to distinguish. And it renders very nicely on a high-DPI display.Its tilde is pretty bad, though. It&#x27;s tiny and almost looks like a hyphen. So that was the first thing I fixed, putting in a better tilde.Then I experimented with spacing for the _ and . glyphs. I added negative margin on both sides of the _, while keeping its width. And I added positive spacing on both sides of the . glyph. Consider code like this:snake_case_name.another_snaky_name()These spacing changes have the affect of pulling the individual words in each name closer together, while increasing the separation between the two names.It is subtle, but to my eye it helps readability.Next up will be to add some positive margin inside the three pairs of brackety things: (), [], {}. I have always found that it helps readability to add a space inside parens and such, but most contemporary code formatters prohibit this. With a proportional font I can tweak the font to put some visual spacing there. reply adastra22 7 hours agorootparent\"If you stop doing things which derive benefits from monospaced fonts, then you can get away with a proportional font.\"Thanks, but no.

It&#x27;s a cool idea, but when I type \"gimme\" in the editor, the two adjacent m&#x27;s are different widths, and it looks sooo wrong.Interestingly enough, the fact that letterforms change as I type doesn&#x27;t bother me the way I thought it would -- turns out I&#x27;m already kinda used to it from ligatures.So points for being a clever idea to try out, but unfortunately what it does to a word like \"gimme\" just makes it a non-starter.

I think for anything to look monospace for me the following two properties are non-negotiable.1) Horizontal spacing needs to align vertically between glyphs of the same letters on separate lines. This is the example I give elsewhere of a letter \"i\" being in a very slightly different position than the same letter just two lines above it. I personally find this extremely disturbing and unpleasant to look at in monospace.2) The glyph of a letter needs to be the exact same between instances of the same letter that are in any kind of visual proximity. This is the \"gimme\" example the parent of your comment gives. AnyThinG ElSe LoOkS lIkE jumblycase. Which I think we can all agree is just plain horrible. reply crazygringo 9 hours agorootparentprevSpecifically for monospace fonts, it&#x27;s not obvious to me how any further work could fix it.The same letterform having different widths just looks bad and wrong.It&#x27;s not like kerning, which always looks good when done well (for proportional fonts). reply galaxyLogic 7 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s not obvious to me how any further work could fix it.In \"gimme\" you could have a rule that when any character is next to itself both occurrences must have the same width.

You&#x27;d allow things to get out of sync and not be on a perfect grid, so long as you could align everything at key points where a line has the same character on two successive lines, or some other case where you know you need alignment.Everything else would just look like a proportional font.Maybe it would influence coders too much and subconsciously make them choose names that line up well though... reply vinberdon 14 hours agoparentprevYeah...

Encoding issues are very common, funnily enough, when you&#x27;re writing code meant to handle display text. Not just web pages, but even native apps that must support almost any language that isn&#x27;t English. Not all work is lighthearted when it comes to fixing these mistakes, nor is the testing reliable. Accessibility is a huge deal and can bring about lawsuits. Really, it even has security implications. If one is this sloppy about fonts I doubt there&#x27;s much validation going on elsewhere yet injection attacks should be trivial to mitigate. Why overcomplicate this? No mere font in your editor is going to distinguish between the string literals for the user and the rest of the code being displayed to the programmer.I&#x27;m not misusing these words for hyperbole. We&#x27;re talking about text. Words like \"literal\" and \"objective\" belong here.It&#x27;s objectively bad to alter the visual presentation of font glyphs for non-functional purposes. If a programmer sees the same glyph with varying width, they have to wonder if they&#x27;re the same underlying character. If a ligature is applied, they have to wonder if it&#x27;s literally the character being displayed. That&#x27;s a huge waste of time for little to no benefit.If y&#x27;all want pretty code it must be done at the text encoding and compiler level (invent a new keyboard layout while you&#x27;re at it!), not in the fonts... but that too would just repeat the sins of the past. :) reply thih9 4 hours agorootparentprevThis ship has literally sailed, hyperbole continues to affect our language whether we want it or not. reply jval43 4 hours agorootparentprevLigatures are great if done right.

I hope \"reduced animation\" turns this kind of thing off (but I couldn&#x27;t find the setting in chrome at a quick look...) reply galaxyLogic 7 hours agoparentprevI think they should adjust their rules so that when a character is next to itself, both occurrences must use the same variant. reply notpushkin 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not sure if the name “Texture Healing” is descriptive enough (perhaps I&#x27;m not that much of a typography nerd I think I am!), but I love the idea. Basically it resolves pairs or triplets of monospace letters to make some of them wider when adjacent letter can be made narrower instead.Another variation on that theme are “duospace fonts”, like iA Writer Duo [1]. Those use two character widths instead of one (i.e. wide characters are always 1.5x wider than narrow). I think this could work for code, too.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia.net&#x2F;topics&#x2F;in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-font reply agalunar 14 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve never heard \"texture\" used this way, although that&#x27;s not saying much. My personal opinion would be that it&#x27;s not the right word. I have heard the term “color” used in typography to describe the balance of positive and negative space on the page in phrases like “even (or uneven) color”. But although that feels closer, it also doesn&#x27;t feel quite right in this case. It reminds me of the subtle changes in tracking and glyph width that some justification engines perform:“Most of the type set in the past five hundred years is justified type, and most of it has been justified line by line, by the simple expedient of altering the space between the words. There are, however, better ways. Scribes justify text as they write by introducing abbreviations and subtly altering the widths of letters. Gutenberg replicated the feat by cutting and casting a host of abbreviations and ligatures along with multiple versions of certain letters differing modestly in width. In the early 1990s, Peter Karow and Hermann Zapf devised a means of doing much the same in the digital medium[.] [...] Another thing computer software can do – because Karow taught it how – is justify text by making subtle alterations in the spaces within letters as well as those between letters and words.”The Elements of Typographic Style, fourth edition, by Robert Bringhurst, pp 191–192. reply dwringer 13 hours agorootparentI think \"texture\" makes sense, if only by analogy to the calligraphic hand Textura, or the etymological derivation of \"text\" itself. reply kevin_thibedeau 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d call it dynamic monospace. reply beeforpork 13 hours agoprevHmm -- I do not understand what is the use case for this. For best design, clearly, I&#x27;d use a proportional font. So whenever I want a monospace font, there are reasons that exclude proportional fonts. An obvious reason would be a grid that the letters need to be arranged in (for whatever reason). But then, I can only imagine that any smart rearrangement of letters out of their grid box will be unwanted, because it interfere with that grid. Instead, stupidly simple letter placement will be what I want.I have an idea for an advanced technique that yields much better visual appearance (but that is also not want you&#x27;d want, for the same reasons): instead of just focussing on pairs of letters (so primitive!), consider whole words and optimise their letters&#x27; shape, width, and horizontal position, but keep the size of box of the word. I call that &#x27;equilibrium texture healing&#x27;. reply heisenzombie 11 hours agoparentIn this technique the letters do not leave their grid box. A wide letter next to a narrow letter will at most push hard up against the edge of its box (usually there has to be white space there so that, e.g. mm doesn’t become one glyph) reply finnh 11 hours agorootparentThe text states that, but then in the Healing Examples section [0], the \"m\" in \"filming\" clearly spills over its left border line.Is that just a poorly drawn&#x2F;incorrect example graphic?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;githubnext&#x2F;monaspace&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Textu... reply ec109685 5 hours agorootparentIt still makes lines with N characters take up the same amount of space, honoring the fundamental characteristic of monotype. reply ska 10 hours agoparentprevIt seems to be a weird mix of half-assed kerning and scaling mixed together.Perceptually, based only on playing with it a minute, it seems to improve legibility a bit (but not as much as a proportional font would be) but also visually breaks the alignment a little sometimes.Not sure it&#x27;s a worthwhile overall, but interesting. reply galaxyLogic 7 hours agorootparentI think it is intersting and can be improved reply virtualritz 12 hours agoprevThis is great as it improves glyph&#x2F;bg contrast when possible (i.e. readability of individual glyphs) and it makes the text&#x27;s texture look more uniform (hence the name).Things people here seem to misunderstand:1. The grid is not affected. The resp. letters stay within their grid-aligned bounding boxes.2. Letters may change while you type but this is not noticeable in practice. I have a 3.2x2k 15\" screen on my laptop. At my editor&#x27;s effective font size of around 20px (capital letters, from baseline to top) the change in shape is about a pixel for something like the letter &#x27;m&#x27;.Caveat: I&#x27;m an ex-typographer. As such I not only do care way more about these things than the average engineer. I&#x27;m also more aware that these things do have an effect on eye&#x2F;brain&#x2F;visual system strain that is possibly very hard to quantify.But legibility of a text is a thing. And the font with its properties is one very important factor (font width&#x2F;kerning&#x2F;line height are equally important in that regard -- nevertheless).Edit: typos reply deaddodo 3 hours agoparent> 1.

It also has a low x-height and tall line height and doesn&#x27;t even try to work at small font sizes but it looks really nice if you make it big enough.

It sends secret credentials to Microsoft servers. Lesezeit: 5 Min. In Pocket speichern vorlesen Druckansicht Kommentare lesen 6 Beiträge (Bild: IB Photography/Shutterstock.com) 10.11.2023 15:34 Uhr c't Magazin Von Dirk Knop Ronald Eikenberg Stefan Wischner Inhaltsverzeichnis Microsoft lays hands on login data: Beware of the new Outlook New Outlook: Warning about data transfers Other accounts EU Data Protection Institutions get involved (This is a translation of this german article.) The new Outlook is not what it seems at first glance: a replacement for Microsoft Office Outlook - at least not yet. What it definitely is, however: way too curious. Microsoft is singing the praises of the new Outlook and wants to persuade users to switch. But beware: if you try out the new Outlook, you risk transferring your IMAP and SMTP credentials of mail accounts and all your emails to Microsoft servers. Although Microsoft explains that it is possible to switch back to the previous apps at any time, the data will already be stored by the company. This allows Microsoft to read the emails. The Windows Start menu shows new Outlook as recommendet App after installing Win11 2023 update. (Bild: Screenshot / rei) The new Outlook now appears as a recommended app in the Windows Start menu of Windows 11 devices with the 2023 update. The Outlook client itself also offers to test the new Outlook version with a \"The new Outlook\" switch. This is still under development, but is set to replace the mail program and the calendar included in Windows in 2024. In a recent tech community article, Microsoft employee Caitlin Hart also explains that it will also replace the classic Outlook. However, unlike the Windows Mail and Calendar apps, the timetable for this has not yet been set. New Outlook: Warning about data transfers When adding a mail account in the new Outlook that is not hosted by Microsoft but is located on company mail servers, for example, the program displays a message. It links to a support article that simply states that non-Microsoft accounts are synchronized with the Microsoft cloud, whereby Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and IMAP accounts are currently supported. The new Outlook also does this in the versions for Android, iOS and Mac. This means that copies \"of your email, calendar, and contacts will be synchronized between your email provider and Microsoft data center\". This gives the company full access to all emails and allows it to read and analyze them. Microsoft wants to provide functions that way that Gmail and IMAP do not offer. The new Outlook shows a message that it sends data to Microsoft Cloud servers. (Bild: Screenshot / rei) The note makes you wonder: What does Microsoft transfer where? When creating an IMAP account, c't was able to sniff the traffic between new Outlook and the Microsoft servers. It contained the target server, log-in name and password which were sent to those Servers of Microsoft. Although TLS-protected, the data is sent to Microsoft in plain text within the tunnel. Without informing or inquiring about this, Microsoft grants itself access to the IMAP and SMTP login data of users of the new Outlook. When adding an IMAP account, new Outlook sent login data and server information to Microsoft. (Bild: Screenshot) Other accounts When switching from the old Outlook to the new one, it is installed the new software in parallel. Previously set up IMAP accounts are not automatically transferred, but the account stored in Windows is. During the test with Google accounts, authentication with OAuth2 was used. Users receive an authentication request and Microsoft does not receive any specific access data, but only an access token that users can revoke again. An answer to our request for a statement from Microsoft is still pending. At this point in time, however, we must warn against trying out the new Outlook without thinking. In addition to all the emails, some credentials may even end up with Microsoft. Microsoft already attracted attention with such data redirections at the beginning of the year. After Office updates were applied on Mac computers, Outlook redirected the data to Microsoft's cloud servers without any user notification. At that time, the remedy was to delete IMAP accounts and set them up again. However, this is obviously no longer helpful with the new Outlook. EU Data Protection Institutions get involved The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, Professor Ulrich Kelber, is alarmed by the data detour in Microsoft's new Outlook. He posted on Mastodon that he wants to ask for a report from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who is responsible for companies like Microsoft, during a meeting of the European data protection supervisory authorities on Tuesday of the coming week.

So the Google account password doesn&#x27;t get sent to Microsoft servers or stored locally or anything, as it does with a regular IMAP account.Microsoft stores an OAuth2 access token for these accounts, which is still unnecessary compared to the locally synced version of Outlook we&#x27;re all used to, but the user can revoke it through Google account settings at any time, just like any other OAuth2 access token. reply olyjohn 15 hours agorootparentprevThe already call IMAP an inscure, outdated service. So when you enable it, they will disable it for you after so many days whether you want them to or not. reply andix 14 hours agorootparentI think it really is a security issue to some extent, because it doesn&#x27;t support multi factor authentication.For most services email is the master key to reset your password. By getting access to someone&#x27;s email account a lot of other accounts can be breached easily. I try to disable password reset via email wherever possible. But most services don&#x27;t provide this option.I think it would be time for IMAP to get a standardized way to log in via OAuth2&#x2F;OIDC. And maybe an update to the email standard to mark a recovery links or codes as secret, that require 2FA every time to read.Especially dangerous are servers that still allow using IMAP without TLS, that&#x27;s just asking for trouble. reply vasdae 14 hours agorootparentprevThat is false. reply wannacboatmovie 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s rich, considering Google invented email credential harvesting. reply cma 15 hours agorootparentprevGoogle won&#x27;t let you backup any parts of your phone without sending them your private wifi key. reply tempodox 19 hours agoparentprevYou can rely on Microsoft to come up with the next abuse and make a security hole out of it. reply pyeri 18 hours agoparentprevIs this the same company that once created remarkable technological innovations like Windows XP, .NET Framework, Visual Studio Express, etc?

Evolution looks really dated nowadays.Personally I can recommend eM Client for Windows users as an Outlook replacement (and they have a macOS version too).

I want to search, I select the folder, click into the search box, type 1 character, move my hand off the keyboard, over to the mouse, to re-click into the goddamn search box, then continue typing.That&#x27;s Microsoft \"improving\" a product.Man, I fucking hate these people. reply ubermonkey 17 hours agorootparentI dislike Outlook as a client for sure, but I must grudgingly admit that Outlook + Exchange is the single best, most usable, most seamless group calendaring & meeting tool I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a LOT).For that reason, I end up keeping my corporate mail in TWO clients: True desktop Outlook in a Win VM, and also in my Mac&#x27;s Mail.app. 99% of my mail I handle on the Mac side (for one thing, search is WAY WAY WAY BETTER). But scheduling? True Outlook every time. It&#x27;s just better.I haven&#x27;t seen or used the \"new Outlook,\" but it sounds like another example of MSFT calling multiple products by the same name to muddy distinctions for marketing reasons (e.g., \"SQL Sever\" and \"Azure SQL\"). \"New Outlook\" definitely doesn&#x27;t sound like something I could or would ever use. reply jabroni_salad 16 hours agorootparent\"new outlook\" is just the webmail, you can see it at outlook.office365.com if you want.It has a couple benefits. The search is better since it isn&#x27;t limited to your local cache, and your scheduled emails don&#x27;t require that you have outlook running on the desktop at go time. I try not to use it otherwise. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentSearch is the one thing that&#x27;s been absolutely horrendous - I can be staring at an email, search for a phrase or similar from that email, and it can&#x27;t find it.And good luck searching for calendar items. reply ubermonkey 13 hours agorootparentI find, and have always found, that search in Outlook is so bad it&#x27;s just not worth doing.Search in the native Mac Mail client?

That the desktop app re-uses the same APIs as the mobile app rather than process mail locally makes sense from a code reuse and efficiency standpoint, but really only because your accounts can seamlessly carry over to all your devices.It’s arguable that the distinction between keeping your password in the cloud and keeping your password local is a security risk. However, if you previously used Outlook.com to check your IMAP email, and maybe this is where the feature derives from, then you already provided your IMAP password to Microsoft on the web. Likewise Google for importing IMAP to Gmail. We do this because it is nicer to get one inbox and one push notification across multiple accounts - when we want cloud providers checking emails for us.It is less clear why a desktop app would do this unless you opted in to fancier service of some kind - e.g. viewing emails on the web when not at this device, or push notifications to your mobile phone, etc.If Microsoft wanted to read your emails even with a locally stored and never shared IMAP password, they could still send telemetry derived from the local client to build an advertising profile based on local emails, or to display targeted ads. They don’t technically need your password to read your emails if you are using their email client. reply fifteen1506 18 hours agoparentprevThe problem is Microsoft using its servers as the middle man, without fair warning.

The difference is whether you have permission to be driving that car.Both Gmail and Outlook are receiving passwords, then using those to perform IMAP requests from their servers. The difference is that Gmail had permission to do so, while Outlook did not. reply MereInterest 15 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s to distinguish this behavior from password managers. Here, the message is sent to Microsoft in an encrypted form, but Microsoft can decrypt it to access the underlying password. For password managers, the remote server receives a password in an encrypted form, and cannot decrypt it to access the underlying password.It could have been phrased better, but the clear message is that Microsoft has pilfered access to unencrypted passwords, regardless of any transportation-level encryption. reply Retric 18 hours agoparentprevThe concern is someone logging into Gmail is sending plain text passwords and email contents to Microsoft.

PHOTO: NYTIMES Updated November 9, 2023 at 5:39 PM More Whatsapp Linkedin FB Messenger Telegram Twitter Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print Copy permalink NEW YORK – Mr Danny Taing’s 55,000 Kit Kats began their long, twisted, and sometimes obscure journey in Japan. Mr Taing is the founder of Bokksu, a New York company that sells Japanese snacks in subscription boxes, and he intended to make a tidy sum by flipping the sweets in the United States. The KitKat shipment, which included sought-after flavours such as melon, matcha latte, and daifuku mochi, had cost US$110,000 (S$149,000), but Bokksu expected to make about US$250,000 in total revenue. “You can fit a lot of KitKats into two containers,” Mr Taing said. And they are a booming business. In Japan, enthusiasts clamour for the rarer flavours, with some sold for just a few weeks or only in a specific region. In the United States, obsessives fawn over the collectibles, comparing reviews on Japanese snack blogs and shelling out for limited editions. These particular KitKats would become key players in an ultimately frustrating saga of shell e-mail accounts, phantom truckers, supply-chain fraud and one seriously bewildered cargo freight broker. Interviews and e-mails shared with The New York Times tell the story of just one instance of “strategic theft”, a growing corner of the criminal world that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has said accounts for some US$30 billion in losses a year – with food being among the top targets. The precious sweets landed safely enough in California, and were trucked about 48km across Los Angeles County to a temporary storage facility in South El Monte, run by a company called Japan Crate Acquisition. After weeks of chugging across the Pacific Ocean, they just needed to make the remaining leg of their journey to Bokksu’s warehouse in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and then into the hands of avid candy fans. That was where Mr Shane Black came in. Mr Black, who runs a freight brokering company called Freight Rate Central in Sarasota, Florida, is part of an invisible army of professionals who coordinate and marshal the fleets of trucks that criss-cross the country, carrying everything from chickens to smartphones. For this job, Bokksu would pay him about US$13,000. Mr Black got to it. He posted the job on a trucking board that is something like a Craigslist for freight. Someone named Tristan with HCH Trucking accepted the job (though he was using a Gmail account), and said he would have the shipment picked up shortly. On Aug 9, Tristan wrote in an e-mail: “Hey man, The first one is loaded and rolling, the second one we’ll pick it up tomorrow first thing in the morning.” “There was nothing out of the ordinary,” Mr Black said in an interview. Coming clean Mr Shane Black, who runs freight brokering company Freight Rate Central, was paid US$13,000 to transport the KitKats from Los Angeles to New Jersey, but ended up getting hit by scammers. PHOTO: NYTIMES When the shipments failed to reach New Jersey days after any cross-country trip should have been completed, Mr Black started to have visions of KitKats melting in the summer heat. “Please tell me the freight is in good order and has been refrigerated this whole time?” he e-mailed Tristan. Tristan replied that one of the trucks had broken down in Washington, Pennsylvania, a small city just south-west of Pittsburgh. Tristan reassured him that the Kit Kats were cool and intact, but “if it’s not fixed by today we will have to head back to the shipper and re-unload them there”. That sent up all kinds of red flags for Mr Black. If the truck was in good enough shape to drive over 3,800km back to California, why could it not make it fewer than 650km to New Jersey? So Mr Black called HCH Trucking. “That’s when everything kind of hit the fan,” he said. When he reached the HCH headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey, he heard chaos in the background, sounds of panic. The representative told him that their information appeared to have been compromised. They had never heard of any Tristan. If Mr Black was not dealing with HCH Trucking, who was he dealing with? And most important, where were the six figures’ worth of KitKats? Seemingly on cue, Tristan followed up. “Time for some coming clean,” he confessed. “I’m actually a scammer and the owner of HCH doesn’t have anything to do with this.” “Why though?” Mr Black replied plaintively. “What would you stand to gain? Can I please get access to the loads so I can get them to New Jersey? We’re not a big company at all. It‘s just me... I’m the owner and everything else.” Tristan wrote back: “We’re trying to make money sir, I told you we’re scammers, really sorry I didn’t know your story, and hopefully the loads get to New Jersey.” Tristan included the addresses of two warehouses, both just east of Los Angeles, where he had dropped the loads. More On This Topic $1.4 trillion lost to scams globally; S’pore victims lost the most on average: Study New wave of scams coming and world is unprepared, warns former Obama adviser The strange thing was that Mr Black had never paid Tristan any money; the shipping fee was due on delivery. If this was a con, so far it did not seem to be a very profitable one. In any case, Mr Black couldn’t believe his luck. “When I found out they were at a cold-storage facility, I mean, I was just so happy,” he said. “I thought, ‘OK, we got the freight.’” Out of service Mr Black spun back into action. According to Tristan, one load was at Inland Empire Cold Storage in Jurupa Valley, California. The other was nearby, at Anytime Crossdock in Ontario, California. Tristan then went silent, and did not respond to repeated e-mails from NYTimes seeking comment. Anytime was eager to get the load out of its warehouse and to be paid for nearly two weeks of storage. It turned out that the KitKats had never left California. They had simply been driven about 50km east, put on ice and left to rack up storage fees. “We would like to know when you are going to get this picked up,” Anytime wrote, “as we anticipated this to be a short-term storage request.” When Mr Shane Black discovered that the missing KitKats were in two warehouses in California, he started the process of sending them to New Jersey again. But that was only the beginning of more troubles for him. PHOTO: NYTIMES The outstanding balance for the storage was US$3,830. Mr Black said he paid US$2,000 of that out of his own pocket to secure the release of the freight, with the promise to pay the rest later. Anytime did not respond to repeated requests for comment from NYTimes. Daunted but determined, he started the process over, posting the job again on the freight board. This time he said he got a bite from ‘Manny’ from MVK Transport. According to Mr Black, Manny had the KitKats picked up. At least this half of the shipment was on its way to New Jersey, Mr Black believed. After a few days, though, communications turned spotty. “I’ve been writing you for days now,” Mr Black e-mailed a few days later. “I called yesterday and you hung up and now your phone says it’s out of service.” The next morning, he followed up, now furious: “How do you make money on this??? Are you going to sell KitKats on the corner???” He had been had again. This time, the KitKats had disappeared for good into the expanse of Southern California’s freewayland. Requests for comment sent to MVK went unanswered. ‘We cannot release the freight’ Half the missing shipment of KitKats ended up at Inland Cold Empire Storage, but the storage facility said it could not release the candy without proof of ownership and payment for its services. PHOTO: NYTIMES Inland Cold Empire Storage, at least, still had the other half of the KitKats, and Mr Black, by now frantic to salvage what he could of the candy, was still on the case. “This load was stolen from us, and placed in your storage facility,” he wrote to Inland on Aug 21. Inland replied that its contract was with a man named Harry Centa. “There is no ‘Harry’,” Mr Black explained. Bokksu, cc’ed on the e-mail, was the rightful owner. “‘Harry’ is a fictitious name.” Harry Centa, however, is not a fictitious name. Mr Harry Centa lives in Ohio, and works in shipping. But the entire KitKat affair was news to him. “This is totally fraudulent and not me,” Mr Centa said in an e-mail to the NYTimes. “Good luck and hope they find the KitKats LOL.” Nevertheless, Inland was unmoved: “Without proof that you are the rightful owner and payment for storage we cannot release the freight.” Mr Black said he reached out to the sheriff’s departments of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, but said he was told jurisdictional issues kept them from getting involved, and no reports were filed. He also turned to the team at Bokksu. Did they have anything that he could use to prove their ownership? But Bokksu had essentially fired Mr Black in the meantime, stopped payment on his fee, filed a report with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for insurance purposes, and decided to move on. The KitKats were dead to them. Mr Danny Taing, the founder of New York-based sweets subscription company Bokksu, lost a US$110,000 shipment of Japanese KitKats after they were involved in one of a growing number of “strategic theft” cases. PHOTO: NYTIMES “I don’t know if I would be comfortable selling these to customers,” said Mr Taing, Bokksu’s founder. “What if something actually happens to customers that eat this, and we get sued?” Meanwhile, the KitKats are still at Inland, according to the company’s chief executive officer Kevin Sacalas. “We have no use for this product and would happily release it to anyone who would show proof of proper ownership and pay the storage fees,” Mr Sacalas wrote in an e-mail to NYTimes. More On This Topic WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram emerge as platforms of choice for scammers Impact of scam on victims goes beyond money as they lose trust in people, become stressed: Panel Chess v checkers The Bokksu KitKats are just one instance of an increasingly common computer-based form of fraud that some experts call “fictitious pickups” or “strategic theft”. It is part identity theft, part extortion. The freight, sometimes called a “hostage load”, can vanish if the extortion demands are not met. “The more you unpeel the onion, the worse it gets,” said Mr Keith Lewis, vice-president of operations at CargoNet, which is part of the global data analytics and technology provider Verisk. He said that strategic cargo theft is up 700 per cent in 2023. “The supply chain is moving at the speed of light,” he said, adding: “The bad guys are playing chess and we’re playing checkers. We’re two or three steps behind them.” As for Bokksu, its insurance claim has been denied. So the blame is now flowing backward along that supply chain. Bokksu holds Mr Black responsible. He fell for an obvious scam, they said, and the Gmail addresses should have been a red flag. Mr Black said truckers do not always use company domains. Ultimately, he blames Japan Crate Acquisition, which originally released the KitKats to ‘Tristan’. “Obviously it didn’t go to an HCH truck,” Mr Black said, and whoever loaded the shipment “should’ve been suspicious.” In possibly the strangest twist on the KitKat trail, Bokksu announced in September that it had acquired Japan Crate. But NYTimes discovered that the acquisition had actually been completed back in June. So Bokksu, through a wholly owned subsidiary, had in effect overseen the loading of its own KitKats onto the original two fraudulent trucks. “I’ve been doing this for over two decades now, and I’ve never come across anything like this, anything of this magnitude,” Mr Black said. “It’s beyond crazy, it really is. Because there’s no answers.” “I do feel cheated,” he added. “I just don’t know who is doing the cheating.” NYTIMES More On This Topic Scam scourge here to stay, other countries learning from Singapore’s anti-scam approach: Police Can you spot a scam?

But NYTimes discovered that the acquisition had actually been completed back in June. So Bokksu, through a wholly owned subsidiary, had in effect overseen the loading of its own KitKats onto the original two fraudulent trucks.My suspicion is that Danny Tiang may have orchestrated the loss of his valuable Japanese KitKats in order to try to recoup an insurance payment. This may have been simply in response to him doubting an ability to sell the product, or due to a temperature excursion he was notified of en route that made them unsalable, but which he concealed to facilitate their loss and subsequent, admittedly failed, insurance fraud. Is that plausible?I&#x27;m not saying it happened and I feel terrible for the guy to not get his KitKats, but the acquisiton casts a bit of doubt on his story I feel. reply riffraff 3 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s the picture in the article that really sells this theory.I assume Mr Taing to be a stand up honest person but why the heck did they put a picture of him half smirking in penumbra in a Dr Evil pose? reply keepamovin 2 hours agorootparentThat’s another great point. I noticed that too, and the suggestion that it makes.However, besides the image, in the article they don’t exactly sell the theory that he does anything suspicious at all. I don’t think they even suggested it. It seems he’s painting entirely as the victim.This seeming contrast raises a fascinating point.I totally agree with you of the importance of image messaging. Image analysis in the media of different countries is such a fascinating thing.Like if you look at the representation of how: Black people are portrayed in American media; how Asian people are portrayed in American media; how white people are portrayed in Asian media; how Middle Eastern people are displayed in Anglosphere Western media — it’s very intriguing. By media here here I mostly mean the kind of editorial and advertising photography which you identified, wherever that is carried even in video.It’s very a fascinating topic, and while it provides a clear window into the racial biases of different cultures it’s not extensively analyzed within the same channels that carry that imagery.Yet it’s this powerful form of implicit messaging. The messaging functions through the presentation of a photorealistic “life like” (reflection of life) image that presents, programs, propagates and reinforces those racial biases.Paradoxically, almost all cultures will pay lip service to wanting to do away with racism, while yet also dealing extensively in this imagery that implicitly carries negative racist messages. This creates a strange reinforcement of the stereotypes that, in words at least, a culture commonly says it seeks to reject. reply kuschku 3 hours agoparentprevOr, much more likely, to prevent further issues in the supply chain he decided to acquire the supply chain. reply keepamovin 2 hours agorootparentYeah, that sounds reasonable.

If your business empire intersected a disaster at multiple points, figuring out which of your many insurance policies should pay out could be non-trivial, and reviewing the various terms, you might lean towards a preferred narrative.

He told me he would just skip scanning a pallet at the docks as they were loaded into his trailer, and then his mate would meet him at a roadside services on the motorway with a van and they would somehow move the pallet off the semi into the van.Sometimes I would hit the jackpot and get dozens of the really expensive bears. I sold 800 bears once for $250,000 in cash to a guy who flew into the UK from Chicago.The truck driver found me. He must have seen one of my adverts in the press or maybe someone he knew came to one of my Beanie Baby fairs, or heard one of my adverts on the radio. He lived in this crazy council town near me in Bristol where every house appeared to be of government construction, even the church.

And also rack up the fees by denying any claim of actual ownership for some period.

You have the “unassociated” scammer admit to it otherwise they don’t know to come get the shipment (and pay the fee). reply atombender 6 minutes agorootparentWhy does the scammer need to contact them? Why can&#x27;t the warehouse call and go \"Uh, we seem to have your shipment, I don&#x27;t know why it was off-loaded here, but now that it&#x27;s here you need to pay us\"? reply unyttigfjelltol 10 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the scammer got stuck on the storage fee and paperwork too while he spent the time searching for a buyer for this unique product. Then when he identified the fence he was into storage fees deeper than his liquidity (beyond merely cutting the scam in half-- his first plan). So he had the broker pay storage, release the product, then targeted the broker a second time with the same scam-- same board, same method, this time laser-focused and with success. reply lawlessone 11 hours agorootparentprevThat is what I am thinking too. reply zoky 12 hours agoparentprevEspecially when they hadn’t even made any money on the scam, according to the article. What’s the angle here?It’s a bit far-fetched I suppose, but the only possible explanation I can see for all of this is that this is an attempted (but bungled) insurance fraud scheme on the part of Bokksu. Especially given the conclusion of the article, where it turns out that a Bokksu subsidiary was in charge of handing off the shipment to the supposed trucking company. I wonder if there were actually Kit Kats in the shipment at all… reply default-kramer 9 hours agorootparentA sibling comment mentions why this isn&#x27;t likely (half of them are still sitting in storage). But I love this theory anyway - with some more creative liberties, you could write a script to rival The Big Lebowski! reply unyttigfjelltol 11 hours agorootparentprevEasy to find out since half are still at the warehouse.... reply zoky 11 hours agorootparentIt occurred to me though that it could also be a “double-dipping” scam. The fake shipping company supposedly “loses” the merchandise, an insurance claim is filed, then the Kit Kats are quietly retrieved and resold. In that case, even if the insurance company refuses to pay out (as they did) it&#x27;s not a total loss, as they&#x27;re only out a few grand in storage fees. It&#x27;d be fairly low risk as well, as there wouldn&#x27;t be any tangible evidence of fraud, and in the worst case it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to recover the Kit Kats and pretend they were miraculously found.It still seems sort of unlikely to me that Bokksu was attempting to commit insurance fraud, but it&#x27;s hard to deny that the facts seem oddly to fit. Why would the scammer take the truckload to a cold storage facility, rather than, say, just abandoning the containers somewhere? Why would he admit to being a scammer, if not in order to provide a basis for an insurance claim? What possible benefit was there to the scammer, when he didn&#x27;t even get any money for his role in the scheme (at least, not from the trucking broker)? And why would Bokksu not disclose until well after the fact that they owned the company that was responsible for releasing the containers to the trucking company?For a company valued at $100M, $110K does seem like a trifling amount of money to commit fraud over, but stranger things have certainly happened. reply unyttigfjelltol 10 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t make sense that the original owner would allow this to go so far as 50% of the load being lost in storage bureaucracy and the mess published by a journalist.

The CL post was really well done, quite detailed (I remember it had photos and talked about how it was in tip-top shape except for the screen having a dead pixel in the lower left).But the price was juuuuust a little too good to be true.

Was the plan to ransom the container to the owner? reply xsmasher 11 hours agoparentJudging from the anger of the second driver, the scam is to steal the load and resell it on the black market; the driver must not have known what he was picking up? Or maybe they just take an up-front payment and disappear.Why Tristan bothered taking the loads to the storage facilities instead of just throwing them out the back is a mystery. Or why the storage facilities accepted them without some kind of payment. reply solatic 3 hours agorootparentMy hypothesis:The key to the whole scam is that the shipments are cross-continental and that there&#x27;s no observability into where the shipment is during that time. The scammer immediately drops off the load at a storage facility, which begins to bill for storage time, several days later, when the load is supposed to arrive on the other side of the country, the owner comes looking for it and the storage facility presents the owner with an invoice for storage time that wasn&#x27;t originally needed. The owner pays the storage facility, which sold storage space that would have gone unused, and the storage facility pays the driver a finder&#x27;s fee kickback.It&#x27;s a variant on the squeegee window washers&#x27; scam. Pull up at the stoplight and the scammer starts washing your window, then demands payment for a service you didn&#x27;t agree to. Victims pay because the amount of money is too small relative to the hassle of being held up, not because they (didn&#x27;t) freely purchased a service that they got real value out of. reply closewith 11 hours agorootparentprev> Or why the storage facilities accepted them without some kind of payment.That part is less of a mystery.

Sort of \"uber for freight\" where you sign up owner&#x2F;operators and connect them with freight loads that need to move from one place to another. If the company does the vetting and works with an insurance company to cover liabilities both ways (o&#x2F;o is at fault, shipper is at fault) it seems they could capture some value from creating a safer market. reply jrockway 6 hours agoparent> \"uber for freight\"A few years ago I needed an M1 machine to finalize arm64 support for the product I was working on. I asked our office manager if I could expense one, and the answer was \"yes\". So I went to the Apple store and ordered one with same-day delivery. It turns out that Apple&#x27;s same day delivery provider is ... Uber Eats. After the order was picked up from Apple, you could see the Uber Eats tracking page. It was in transit for about 5 minutes, and then marked as \"delivered\", and the tracking page became unavailable for use. I emailed Apple and they gave me a refund, then I went to the store myself and acted as my own courier. That time I got a laptop.What I&#x27;m saying is, \"uber for X\" is exactly what already exists. Someone picks up your stuff for a small fee, and if it&#x27;s good, they just keep it for themselves and re-join the platform with a new name.Incidentally, Apple no longer offers same-day delivery, at least to me. reply ChuckMcM 4 hours agorootparentOuch!

Am I missing something? reply ChuckMcM 11 hours agorootparentI was struck by these two paragraphs in the article:Mr Black, who runs a freight brokering company called Freight Rate Central in Sarasota, Florida, is part of an invisible army of professionals who coordinate and marshal the fleets of trucks that criss-cross the country, carrying everything from chickens to smartphones. For this job, Bokksu would pay him about US$13,000.Mr Black got to it. He posted the job on a trucking board that is something like a Craigslist for freight. Someone named Tristan with HCH Trucking accepted the job (though he was using a Gmail account), and said he would have the shipment picked up shortly.Mr. Black here apparently doesn&#x27;t have an app to connect him to legitimate truckers, instead he relies on a \"job board kind of like Craigslist\". My assumption was that the availability of a better executed LTL freight logistics company would put people like Mr. Black out of business. So maybe the real challenge here is connecting those better companies with people like Mr. Taing?Of course given the way the article ends up it is entirely possible that Mr. Taing is the bad guy here. reply jcpst 10 hours agorootparentThe market is very competitive- capacity can get tight, which makes room for the “little guy” to grab a load. Even at the biggest companies with millions of lines of software, tons of logistics is still driven by email.Job boards are big business. They act like a 4th party logistics company, where they aggregate the available loads from multiple 3rd party logistics companies.

Nothing more ridiculous than being a junk food hipster. “Real” sugar is still a processed and refined product. Not really sure how it’s superior to HFCS (and I’ve heard all the pseudoscience BS).

For one, the molecules in sugar are disaccharides while in HFCS they are free. High Fructose CS also has more fructose, which is the worst type of sugar. There’s a Wikipedia page I’ve been trying to find again for years, but basically fructose is multiple times more reactive in your blood than glucose and creates nasties when it reacts with other things you eat, namely fats. reply Freedom2 9 hours agorootparentprevGive me my real American corn syrup - other less-free countries can keep their &#x27;real&#x27; sugar!! reply electriclove 12 hours agorootparentprevWhere did you order from? reply robotnikman 11 hours agorootparentJust search Japanese kitkat and you will find a bunch of online seller, and they are found on Amazon as well.

I used to live in a city with a large japanese enclave and they were pretty well available from local asian grocery stores, though still 5 times as expensive as regular. reply adhesive_wombat 12 hours agoparentprevIt certainly seems strange. But maybe the demand from a relatively few Japanophiles doesn&#x27;t outweigh the adminstrative costs of maintaining a much larger number of SKUs (including regulatory requirements) and they&#x27;d send boxes of green tea chocolate to go out of date on shelves. I&#x27;d have thought a big corporate would have pretty scalable product range management but maybe it&#x27;s just cheaper to hand that off to importers. Some calculation must presumably be involved.Though I like to think the Nestlé&#x2F;Hershey executives have been threatened by immaculately-suited Pocky-toting enforcers of the importers making profits on the novelty arbitrage. reply abhorrence 12 hours agoparentprevPresumably in this case it has something to do with how Hershey owns the rights for Kit-Kat in the USA, but Nestle everywhere (at least as far as I know) else. reply dharmab 12 hours agoparentprevJapanese retail space (as in, the physical space available in the stores) favors small batches. US retail space favors economies of scale. reply ajmurmann 5 hours agorootparentDo you know why this is? This seems to be true across a variety of products, including way more interesting fast food offerings. reply busterarm 12 hours agoparentprevBecause it&#x27;s two different companies.KitKat around the world is Nestle. KitKat in the US is under license to Hershey. Licensing is expensive. reply twic 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s Nestle in the UK, and they don&#x27;t sell the Japanese bonus snacks here either. reply busterarm 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also hard to understand just how popular KitKats are in Japan and how their products and limited time offers cater uniquely to the Japanese audience.KitKat has a lot of competition in the UK where caramels are way more popular than weird KK flavors. reply projektfu 12 hours agorootparentprevLicense it to Mondelez and suddenly it will have lots of flavors you won&#x27;t likely buy.... reply pbhjpbhj 12 hours agorootparentKitKat are already full of wafer so Mondelez wouldn&#x27;t be motivated to &#x27;put anything in the chocolate bar at all so long as it&#x27;s not chocolate&#x27;.

Otherwise it is hard to understand what motivation \"Tristan\" had to drop the product off there instead of just, say, abandoning it on the side of the road. I can imagine a scammer getting upset that their load was a bunch of candy and not laptops or something else of high value, but why take it to a storage unit after accepting the load? reply mike_d 11 hours agoparentThe actual scam here didn&#x27;t play out, so NYTimes does not have the full story.What happens is they truck the load to a yard and open it up. The contents of the trailer are then stolen and dumped into the gray market. If it has no value the load gets dumped into a storage facility and because the goods are accounted for law enforcement won&#x27;t get involved.The load was coming from Japan and probably insured for a lot of money, which ticked all the boxes that it would be electronics or household goods of some sort. They were probably shocked when it was just a brunch of weird flavors of candy they couldn&#x27;t sell. reply jsnell 7 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t quite scan either. Avoiding interest from law enforcement could be a motive for returning the goods, but the moment they actually steal a shipment they&#x27;re on the hook again. I think the idea only works if the vast majority of the hijacked containers are returned -- but that is an absurd idea. reply closewith 11 hours agorootparentprev> If it has no value the load gets dumped into a storage facility and because the goods are accounted for law enforcement won&#x27;t get involved.That&#x27;s an excellent insight and explains the big mystery.

Or did they mechanistically go down different paths and each has something unique to contribute? reply kristofferg 6 hours agorootparentThe tone&#x2F;“atmosphere” of DK1 is very strong and the gameplay high-stakes&#x2F;visceral. (Like the previous Magic Carpet games). DK2 went a more stylized, silly and cartoony direction - never resonated as much with me as DK1. DK2 is still a decent game though. reply Sakos 51 minutes agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re both unique. I never really played them back then but gave both a try recently. I feel like DK1 has aged better, especially with DK FX. It feels like it could be a modern indie game. It actually looks gorgeous, imo. DK2&#x27;s move to fully 3D makes it look very dated and the way the UI&#x2F;UX has changed also makes it feel more dated to play than DK1. I found it to be more frustrating just in how you interact with the game.I really enjoyed both games though, so I absolutely recommend playing both. reply jvanderbot 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m confused is this required to run the game or something? reply TonyTrapp 17 hours agorootparentLike most open-source re-implementations of games, you need the original game for its assets. The re-implementation typically only consists of code. So yes, you need to own the original game in order to use KeeperFX. reply chokma 16 hours agorootparentSame with a friend‘s re-implementation of Battle Isle 2 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kitana.org&#x2F;arena&#x2F;bi2&#x2F;bi2.html)You would need the original or the GOG version. reply tomca32 13 hours agorootparentoh wow haven&#x27;t seen this in a long time.

What they didn’t own was the name “Star Control”, hence the project using a different name.Probably my favourite game ever, we owned the original with the map and manual.I replayed it a couple of times as the TUQM, still loved it.I tried replaying the original X-Com, but it had serious quality of life issues (squad members not remembering gear assignments between missions, no keyboard shortcuts during missions) so was just too tedious for me.Apparently there is a reimplementation of the game out there which fixes these things, but at this point in my life my time is too limited. reply ethbr1 11 hours agorootparent> I tried replaying the original X-Com, but it had serious quality of life issuesThere&#x27;s Xenonauts, if you want X-Com, but modern.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;223830&#x2F;Xenonauts&#x2F; reply dharmab 14 hours agorootparentprevOne Hour One Life (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onehouronelife.com) is public domain (software and assets).

Hate to be a party pooper but is that really true? It took all of two minutes to find this in the code:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dkfans&#x2F;keeperfx&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;engine_re... &#x2F;&#x2F;BucketKindPolygonStandard in this function could also be BucketKindPolygonSimple or BucketKindBasicUnk10 idk all 3 pretty similar int z; struct BucketKindPolygonStandard *v5; int v6; struct BasicQ *v7; if ( (ec1->field_8 & (uint16_t)(ec2->field_8 & ec3->field_8) & 0x1F8) == 0 && (ec3->view_width - ec2->view_width) * (ec1->view_height - ec2->view_height) + (ec3->view_height - ec2->view_height) * (ec2->view_width - ec1->view_width) > 0 ) {I dunno, this looks a lot like decompiled code. There are lots of other variables with names like v15, v16 etc in other parts of the code too. reply TonyTrapp 16 hours agoparentThey definitely interpret things a bit differently. The main achievement here is that all the code required to run the game is now open, the game no longer jumps into original game code from the original Dungeon Keeper executable in order to function. Whether the source in itself is 100% legal is not part of that equation. reply thomasahle 17 hours agoparentprevDo people use LLMs to \"improve\" decompiled code? Just plugged the above into Gpt-4 and got: &#x2F;&#x2F; The choice of PolygonKind can be PolygonStandard, PolygonSimple, or BasicUnk10 - they are quite similar in functionality int intersectionResult; struct PolygonStandard *polygonStandard; int computationResult; struct BasicQueue *basicQueue; if ((edgeClipper1->clipMask & (uint16_t)(edgeClipper2->clipMask & edgeClipper3->clipMask) & 0x1F8) == 0 && (edgeClipper3->viewWidth - edgeClipper2->viewWidth) * (edgeClipper1->viewHeight - edgeClipper2->viewHeight) + (edgeClipper3->viewHeight - edgeClipper2->viewHeight) * (edgeClipper2->viewWidth - edgeClipper1->viewWidth) > 0) {Seems it didn&#x27;t really understand \"BucketKind\". Neither do I to be honest. reply galangalalgol 16 hours agorootparentThat is the first impressive thing I&#x27;ve seen a llm do with code. My company does not allow their use out of legal concerns so I haven&#x27;t tried using them for anything since playiwith the initial gpt trial. I was not at all impressed then. Can you really just point it at your code base and ask it to improve the variable names or whatever? reply mkoryak 15 hours agorootparentNo don&#x27;t do this.Once I asked chatgpt to make some obfuscated+minified js readable for me. It did. I was blown away by how well it chose the variable names.I started looking at this code to find the prod bug, but I found other bugs that I wasn&#x27;t expecting...I took a closer look and realized that the code it made was almost right, but also 5% wrong.I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed the incorrectness if I wasn&#x27;t debugging for several hours before and had some general idea of what the pretty printed code did and did not do. reply pjerem 11 hours agorootparentMaybe you can get achieve it by asking it to just give you the name correspondances in a table and do the renaming yourself.That’d be hardly useful in a full file with colliding names but on a single function that may be useful. reply jerf 14 hours agorootparentprevAh, here we see the great danger of LLMs, which is that they have the ability to be confident enough to bullshit you completely successfully. I don&#x27;t think this is clipping edges, although I could be wrong about that, but if all thomasahle was to put the exact above code into GPT-4 and did not go to the source and pull more out, GPT has absolutely no reason to label \"z\" as \"intersectionResult\" as it was never used in the rest of the code, same for labelling \"v6\" as \"computationResult\", and the guesses for polygonStandard and basicQueue are at best the first stab a decompiler might take, but there&#x27;s probably a better name than simply reiterating the type.That&#x27;s not better variable names; that&#x27;s better-looking garbage. At least you know you don&#x27;t know what \"v7\" is. With the post-LLM code you&#x27;re having to poke through confident error. reply qqluqq 16 hours agorootparentprevthey became popular just a bit after I finished all the RE work, so no didn&#x27;t use any for it reply araes 16 hours agorootparentprevThey do now reply qqluqq 16 hours agoparentprevit&#x27;s decompiled yes, used to rely on a dll that was just the converted og exe, but now it&#x27;s now fully readable code, minus maybe a few random variable names here and there, I don&#x27;t believe it says anywhere it was done from scratch reply ur-whale 16 hours agoparentprev> I dunno, this looks a lot like decompiled code.And what if it is?

There are no damages to award, so there&#x27;s no reason that this would even make it into court. If it did go to court (as part of a larger case), the artifact decompiled would be proprietary.

Few hypotheses1) great learning experience because you get fast feedback in terms of fidelity to the original, vs. the more amorphous goal of “good game”2) nostalgia3) creating an open source rendition is step 1 to the free-for-all modding utopia that people really wanted in the first place reply ioseph 12 hours agoparentprevBecause programming is an entirely different skill set to game design, art, music, marketing and all the other skills needed up make a game reply Unjust_Harry 13 hours agoparentprevOld games have a pre-established fanbase, so releasing some kind of fix&#x2F;patch&#x2F;remake for one is almost guaranteed to make at-least some people very happy.

(Nintendo recently committed to the latter, but the tone is very different.)Old games are a means of recapturing childhood nostalgia and reliving the fleeting feelings of youth. New games don&#x27;t do that at all.I&#x27;m not even a gamer anymore. I have next to zero time or desire to play new games.

So, as another user said, you need to copy over the files from GOG or a CD, etc. reply AlecSchueler 15 hours agorootparentThat means you still need the original then? What am I missing? Or what&#x27;s the material difference between downloading the assets and downloading the entire executable? reply kroltan 15 hours agorootparentThat it can be distributed, and that there is source available for modifications, expansions, and ports to modern systems.Generally game assets don&#x27;t depend on the external environment like code does. Sure, porting is still a lot of work (which I don&#x27;t think has been done for this one), but it&#x27;s less work than porting an arbitrary executable.But most importantly, not everything has to be a product with a practical benefit for the user, if the project goal is to be able to be a drop in replacement for all the code, and it does it, and the people involved are fulfilled, that is perfectly enough. reply orra 1 hour agorootparentPorts to modern systems is a very practical benefit, which they achieved.IIRC GOG runs the DOS version of Dungeon Keeper on DOSBox, because the Windows version doesn&#x27;t run on modern Windows. This means users miss out on the higher quality graphics mode. reply exDM69 14 hours agorootparentprevThe original game does not work great on modern operating systems and screen resolutions etc. Text sizes, GUI scaling is usually way off in games from this era. Using the \"modernized\" open source engine gives you a better experience.There are also improvements to the user interface that weren&#x27;t a part of the original.Same goes for many other remakes. reply xsmasher 14 hours agorootparentprevFrom the end user POV, no difference - you still need to provide the original game files in order to play.From an engineering POV it&#x27;s great that it no longer needs to call into the old executable; they may be able to drop some legacy code and change some internal types, clearing the road to more changes in the future. reply setr 15 hours agorootparentprevyou need the original assets. KeeperFX replaces the executable and doesn’t ship with the original assets, because it’s not theirs to distribute. The question is simply how you obtain the assets.You don’t have a purchase&#x2F;download option available to only acquire the assets, so you’ll inevitably purchase & download original assets + original executable, discard the original executable and use original assets + keeperfx executable.Or you’ll acquire the original assets alone through nefarious means and can then just use it with the keeperfx executable.Technically I don’t think you can be requested to provide proof of ownership, but keeperfx can definitely be taken down for distribution of assets they don’t own. So the acquisition of those assets falls on you to resolve and is outside their concern. They can only recommend you to purchase the rights to those assets from the proper rights-holders. reply yellow_postit 15 hours agorootparentprevThe assets need to be installed. reply giantrobot 16 hours agorootparentprevJust installed and accessible.

    "title": "Interview with Jeff Geerling: Exploring Raspberry Pi and the Future of Electronics",
    "originLink": "https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/meet-jeff-geerling/",
    "originBody": "Meet Jeff Geerling 10th Nov 2023 Andrew Gregory 3 comments Andrew Gregory of HackSpace magazine sat down with the one and only Jeff Geerling to chat about the wholesome corner of the internet he created. Jeff exploring the Sony factory where Raspberry Pis are baked If you want to cut through the buzzwords and find out what tech actually does, you could do a lot worse than listen to Jeff Geerling. He’s built an utterly wholesome corner of the internet in which he explains, demonstrates, and demystifies the latest thing that everybody else pretends to know about. Linux, single-board computers, open source, developer tools, home automation – Jeff does the lot, and he wants to teach you how to do it, too. We thought we’d talk to him about what he’s been getting up to with his new Raspberry Pi 5. HackSpace: Morning Jeff! You’ve done loads of Pi projects over the last couple of years. What do you still have running at the moment? Jeff Geerling: Things that are practical, really. I have Pis running all of my home network stuff, all the home lab-type things; I have a Pi running internet monitoring, so I can keep my ISP honest. I have a Pi running my VPN. I have no cloud services for my light bulbs, or for my HVAC or anything. It’s all running through Pis. I don’t have any cloud account tie-in. If the internet goes down here, the only thing is I can’t access it remotely, but everything’s still running. I love the privacy aspects of it. And I love the ability to learn new things through it – industrial automations, and controls, and APIs with these different systems. I think one of the things that fascinates me the most is all these different IOT devices. Before I knew much about Pis and microcontrollers, I always thought IoT was magic. And then you open one of these up, and you just see a little microcontroller inside. It might just be an ESP board, or a Pico, or something else. But I know that I could hack it, and that opens up a new world. You could build one of those on your own to just about the same quality; you can’t get injection-moulded plastic, but everything else you can do on your own, and 3D printing has made it so that enclosures can be so much nicer. It’s just cool to see. It’s like taking down the wall of magic that you thought existed between really cool products and your own abilities. Jeff describes himself as an electronics beginner; something tells us he’s being modest The projects that I do are typically rehashes of what other people have done; I might make the documentation a little better or I might package it up a little nicer. But really, I would say that I’m beginner-level electronics and beginner-level microcontrollers. I just have the ability to relate what I’m doing a little better than a lot of people who are experts at it. A year or two ago, I talked to [Linux YouTuber] NetworkChuck about recording a podcast episode. He does a lot of stuff with Raspberry Pis, too, with red hat hacking and black hat stuff. And, you know, fun things. So we recorded the podcast. And it never went up because one of the microphones was messed up, and it sounded terrible. I didn’t hear from him for a while, and then on 01 March this year, he’s just like, ‘Hey, Jeff, do you want to work with me on a Mr. Beast project? At like, 9 am, right now?’ I had no travel planned and no deadlines, so I said yes. And that was terrible, but also awesome. So many people who make things, especially if you make it for production use, want to make sure it actually works. So there’s a deadline attached to it. There are problems; there are always challenges, things you didn’t even think about. And that’s what happened on the Mr. Beast project. But that’s also kind of the addiction that drives us forward. Because while I would say I don’t want to ever do that again, I also say that was a fun experience. And getting to meet all the people there. And all of us going through that at the same time, solving all the challenges. It’s a weird kind of addiction that we have, I think, building software, building hardware, and working on something so big as well. Any time we solved a problem with a five-minute fix, the sheer number of computers we were using turned that into a multiple-hour fix. Testing hardware by dropping a bowling ball on to it. Always wear eye protection! HS: Why Raspberry Pi? What’s so good about it? JG: Raspberry Pi devotes a lot of time to testing and to making sure manufacturing is better. And manufacturing in the UK is a pretty cool thing. How many computer companies manufacture things in their home country – there’s not many, and Raspberry Pi does on a huge scale. So there’s a lot of those things that some people don’t assign value to – not just the bits and the little circuits on the board and all that. Open source is another balance that Raspberry Pi has to offer. There’s the Broadcom chip [which isn’t open-source] versus you’re building the operating system based on Debian, which is like one of the most open-source Linux distributions. And it’s a weird balance. In the hardware world, it seems like there’s a lot less open source, because if you put out an open-source design and someone else makes it, all of a sudden you have zero revenue. Versus software, there’s sales and support and services, and there’s a lot more revenue opportunities that can’t just be immediately consumed by another company. Although, recently we’ve seen Amazon doing that sometimes, and leading to licences like the BSL, which is not really open-source. Jeff’s fascinated by factories. And he loves open source software and hardware HS: I’ve heard of the BSD licence, but not BSL. JG: Most open-source licences don’t care if you’re a government or a spy or a bad person or a good person – it’s free. It’s unencumbered. But the BSL imposes a restriction: if you’re a big business, you can’t use it. Philosophically I can understand that stance, but don’t call it open source: call it ‘source available’ or, you know, ‘maker friendly’. But on the flip side, there’s so many companies that start as a maker, somebody who designs a little thing, that thing becomes popular, and all of a sudden you’re a big business and your licence is void, just because you hit a revenue number. And it doesn’t matter if it’s 50 bucks or $5 billion, it’s a restriction and it’s a philosophical thing that’s not compatible with my understanding of the term ‘open source’. I think Raspberry Pi offers a little bit of a different take on it. Early on, a lot of the hardware was super locked down and there weren’t datasheets. And one by one, they start making things better at release. So, you know, my hope is that someday we could get more open firmware and stuff for the Broadcom chips. I don’t know if that’ll ever happen. But it would be cool. Unlike many companies, where they start out open source and then start closing things, Raspberry Pi has always gotten better, even if it’s not perfect. The Petabyte Pi: a Raspberry Pi with 1024 terabytes of storage HS: Hopefully people will like the new power button. JG: For me, the power button on the Pi 5 is the most appreciated new feature. It’s just so handy. Like, if I’m running a Raspberry Pi headless, with no keyboard, I can just do a quick shut down. I mean, I put power buttons on GPIO before, but it’s cumbersome. This is nice to have it on the board. HS: And have you looked into the dual camera possibilities? JG: So machine vision has gotten really interesting in the past year, to the point where there are open-source tools to do so many things that used to require tons of expensive I/O. You can do stereo camera depth vision with all open-source tools, and [I’m] hoping to use Google Coral TPU to do some of this stuff. Again, it breaks down that barrier between you and the magic. You pick up an iPhone 15 and it can do depth mapping with whatever that sensor is. And you’re like, man, I’ll never be able to do that. And then you get a Pi 5 with Wi-Fi and two cameras, and you’re like, oh, I can plug these open-source libraries together. And we get this – it might not be as high resolution, and it might not be 60 frames per second, but you could do depth mapping and 3D stuff with a little board, and everything’s under 200 bucks, all in, including power supplies and everything. That’s a big difference. When I was a kid, you could go to RadioShack and buy an electronics hobbyist kit. And that’s how I learned the basics of resistors and all that. You put them together with little spring contacts, and it was really fun. And you could make buzzers and radios and all kinds of stuff – they don’t really exist anymore. All those hobbies that were big when I was a kid, a lot of them are superseded just by how amazing the technology we have today is. But the Raspberry Pi brings that back. What’s funny is that the Raspberry Pi is actually better at IoT stuff than most IoT companies. Mostly because of the open source philosophy. If we all work together, all these individuals around the world can write plug-ins and do stuff where you can put home assistant at your house. And you can interact with any light bulb, any doorbell, any camera, any washing-machine controller. Whereas if you get Philips, you get the Philips stuff and if you get Sony, you get the Sony stuff. It’s like the tool world: I use DEWALT mostly, because the first tool I bought was a DEWALT. So you gotta use the DEWALT battery, and then you’re like, well, I could buy this cheaper tool, it’s better. But then it won’t work with my battery. So now I have something like 25 DEWALT tools. I think that’s dumb. It’s ridiculous. And that’s how IoT people want to be: you have the smart hub from this company, and you buy all their stuff. But we’ve already seen companies fail, and then all of your smart stuff becomes dumb. And it’s worse than dumb because you can’t even turn on a light bulb, you know – their server goes down and your lights turn off. This is an area where instead of just seeing behind the curtain how it’s done, you can do it better. That’s one thing that I love about the Raspberry Pi ecosystem and the open-source ecosystem together. HS: A slightly less practical, though no less awesome build of yours is the Pi cluster. Just one question: why? JG: For me, it’s fun. You get something out of it when you’re doing all this work on a cluster. And the first time you see all the nodes come up together, that’s kind of magic. And then also seeing the fact that, like, you can actually program things to scale. It’s useful for a job, especially if you’re gonna build software for the web. It was a springboard for learning. And for a lot of us, we love that. We love hacking with things, and a Pi cluster is just a fun thing to do it. It also has the side benefit of being able to develop skills that might be incredibly useful. There are still a lot of companies that will pay good money for Kubernetes developers, and a lot of people have learned Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi. The shortage really built into that. And a lot of people started using small PCs that they got on eBay, which is perfectly fine. I think that’s awesome. The hard thing was, like, the reason the Pi was great was because it’s a $35 computer – now a $60 computer – but you can still get the Pi 4, and hopefully there’ll be more available now that Pi 5 has been announced. But it was a quick way to get into that whole ecosystem of learning. And, you know, it’s not necessary at all for a home lab. But it’s fun. And it translated into me getting a better job and doing consulting, which also helped me with that opportunity that I got in the pandemic: I was consulting and making extra money from doing all the work I was doing on Pis, learning clustering, because the clustering skills got me a better-paying job. And it gave me the opportunity to save up some money over the next year. I went to full-time YouTube in 2021, so maybe the Pi cluster was the reason I got into it. I did my first Pi cluster in 2016. And I had a cluster running from 2016 to 2020 24/7 at my house, and I think had something like two hours of downtime in that time period. HS: You said that you’re not a hardware guy. Does that mean that you have a background in software? JG: I started off doing web design. The first ever project I did was helping a radio station. They just transitioned to computers instead of CDs for their music playback, and in their system it had a file that would write to with the current song. My dad had the idea of taking this data and putting the song name on the website, so people could be listening, go to the website, on their laptop, or in an office, back then people did not have smartphones. It was ahead of its time. So I built a little interface that had, like, a car radio with the song title in it in a little, I think it was in Courier font or something, because there were only ten or so fonts that you could use back then. It worked for five or six years, until they got a real website. But, that was my first-ever project. I learned electronics from my dad, who’s a radio engineer. And I, you know, I soldered together an FM radio. I still have the voltmeter that I soldered together when I was, like, eight years old or something. It still works, and I keep using it, even though it’s not as accurate as it could be. And I’m excited to do more of that since the Pico came out. I’ve done some more projects: I built a garage door sensor thing, and I’m working on some software for the Pimoroni Galactic Unicorn to write some stuff on the wall. And now I have a new office that I’m gonna go into. So there’s a lot of opportunities to build stuff for that. HS: That’s a majestic piece of kit. JG: Yeah. And they put in little things like a button. You know, it’s nice to have a button here – now you can do, like, modes for the display. And you can even make a little game on the LEDs matrix. That’s the other thing that I love about the Pi ecosystem: Raspberry Pi works directly with some of these companies to make things better for everyone. And these companies work back with them. It’s a relationship that has been built up over the course of the past decade. It’s bearing more fruit with the Pico, and I think the Pi 5 will drive some of that, too. I’m really excited to see what people come up with with HATs for the Pi 5 with PCI Express. If anybody comes out with a dual 2.5 gigabit network cat, I’m gonna buy that thing the second I see it.

It&#x27;s an instant click from me any time his videos (or hn posts) pop up.I get the same feeling from Jeff&#x27;s videos I did when I watched PBS as a kid. That&#x27;s not a dig; I find his videos extremely calming, informative, and well produced. The man radiates positivity and kindness.That&#x27;s a rarity these days on YouTube. Presumably \"high energy\" content does better algorithmically, but for me personally the false enthusiasm, or manufactured outrage trends grow old rather quick. reply hashtag-til 18 hours agoparentMaybe a minor thing, but also interesting to highlight Raspberry Pi blog layout, not polluted with \"subscribe me please\" crap.Quite reassuring that there are still nice places on the internet. reply leosanchez 18 hours agorootparentBut it still has cookie popup crap right ? reply hashtag-til 18 hours agorootparentThat is legally required in some places, I guess. reply prmoustache 13 hours agorootparentNot really, it is only legally required if you act badly. reply ndriscoll 17 hours agorootparentprevBecause of the tracking scripts. reply myself248 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not legally required to use cookies.

I realized I actually had a pi in a box somewhere I&#x27;d won in a hackathon way back when. Set it up. I&#x27;d been doing a lot of linux sysadmin stuff in the past and kinda missed having a server I could upload stuff to. I set up a blog and some other stuff.Got lured into Jeff&#x27;s cluster shenanigans and got a few more pis and set up a tiny cluster with various services I found useful[1]. I built a bunch of services from scratch. Eventually my hybris grew and I started drawing up plans for my own search engine, running off this cluster.I figured why not, covid was coviding and I had a lot of time. Turns out you need more than bunch of pis to run a n internet search engine, so I got a bigger server. Still my first iteration indexded like 200k docs.One thing turned into another and now I&#x27;ve quit my job to work on this full time. Weird how the world works sometimes.I guess what I wanted to say is: Thanks, Jeff.[1] This was before the semiconductor shortage, back when pis were abundant. Sorry if I contributed to any shortages. I&#x27;ve sold off the ones I didn&#x27;t end up using :) reply sureglymop 3 hours agoparentSo that&#x27;s the origin of your search engine! Wow. Both Jeff and you are amazing.

There&#x27;s no reason there couldn&#x27;t be a battery standard. reply geerlingguy 16 hours agoparentI hate it :(At least with the tools, if you pick a brand like DeWalt or Milwaukee... they have been around for decades and will stay around for decades, and the tools don&#x27;t just die if the company gets bought out.Well, at least until &#x27;smart&#x27; tools start getting forcibly pushed into the market. But Internet connectivity is bad enough in many construction environments that it might never happen (we can hope...). reply lostapathy 16 hours agorootparentIf only this was true!I have a bunch of Makita cordless tools (and IME, Makita was #1 for pros 10-15 years ago, not a niche brand).Several years ago (2015-ish?) they changed up the battery shape a little bit so newer batteries wouldn&#x27;t fit on older tools. It was to add another pin so the battery could tell the tool it was dead and quit drawing power (why the battery couldn&#x27;t just cut power is beyond me). So (at the time) I had a drawer full of year-old tools that wouldn&#x27;t work with the extra batteries I just bought.As it turns out, you can file down part of the tool body and the new batteries fit old tools, but without the power protection. So they didn&#x27;t end up in the landfill, but it&#x27;s still hugely annoying. reply ensignavenger 15 hours agorootparentYup, I have a Dewalt set, with their older battery design.... unfortunately my batteries are getting old, the tools are fine, but I can&#x27;t get the old batteries, and if I buy new tools, they will use the new batteries. So... do I buy aftermarket batteries for my existing tools, or get rid of my existing tools and switch to whatever brand next? It is silly. reply leehuffman 11 hours agorootparentI’ve had great luck with NOS 18v batteries from eBay. Had to pick up a pair for an 18v trim nailer that doesn’t support their 20v adapter. My neighbor did the same for his 18v collection. All going strong. reply stonogo 14 hours agorootparentprevDeWalt sells adapters so the 20V lithium batteries fit the 18V NiCad tools. You&#x27;re still locked in, but at least your old tools keep working.

The price is pretty high unfortunately. There are some third party adapters I may get for around 10 dollars each. May be worth it to keep my old tools working. reply mikece 13 hours agorootparentprevHaving done a bunch of research into top-end Milwaukee, DeWalt, Makita, Bosch, Hilti, etc tools I&#x27;ve learned that the tools themselves have management circuitry that talks to the circuitry in the battery (which is monitoring remaining charge, temperature, and a lot of other variables) and the tool and battery can negotiate bursts of electrical current based on the work that is happening (like hammer drilling into concrete, hard wood, steel, etc) giving noticeable boosts of torque at times. While I suppose it&#x27;s possible that a generic battery management&#x2F;demand API could be built to allow any number of tools make use of it&#x27;s electrical reserve that hasn&#x27;t happened yet. I&#x27;m kinda surprised that Tesla hasn&#x27;t pushed for an idea like that... aren&#x27;t they just a battery company that sells cars as a way to sell their batteries? Why not create a kick-ass line of power tools and outdoor power equipment made to use Tesla batteries on any manufacturer&#x27;s equipment that is API compliant.(Oh and Japan mandates a particular kind of battery-to-device interface that isn&#x27;t required anywhere else in the world which is why Makita batteries look different than everyone else&#x27;s...) reply criddell 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true, but there really aren&#x27;t that many power tool companies:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protoolreviews.com&#x2F;power-tool-manufacturers-who-... reply mikece 13 hours agorootparentAnd that doesn&#x27;t account for brands like Harbor Freight who clearly are having their tools made by someone else but they refuse to say who is making their Bauer and Hercules lines. reply obscurette 4 hours agorootparentAnd it doesn&#x27;t seem to account many brands from Europe and Asia. replyeliaspro 12 hours agoparentprevBosch opened their battery ecosystem, branded as \"Bosch AmpShare\" together with Fein and Rothenberger, which covers now more than 25 brands: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ampshare.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F; reply post_break 16 hours agoparentprevThere are adapters for different tool batteries now. reply optimus_banana 18 hours agoprevI remember when geerlingguy was just the author of all the ansible roles I happened to use, crazy to see how much of a \"personality\" he is now. reply squidbeak 18 hours agoparentI remember when he was just midwesternmac and explaining tricky Drupal stuff. He&#x27;s been brilliantly intelligible with everything he covers. reply geerlingguy 17 hours agorootparentHeh, few remember the very early days when I ran a forum on midwesternmac.com — I actually started out doing IT services and web hosting (mostly Drupal, some Wordpress) for local places.The first project I did as an independent LLC was built out a network with a bunch of eMacs and a central G4 server for a law firm :P reply hackmiester 16 hours agorootparentI too took the path of working my way backward in the LAMP stack :) reply Jgrubb 14 hours agorootparentprevTotally, it seems like every tech thing I’ve gotten to in the last 12 years or so - Drupal, Ansible, rpi, a few other things I can’t think of right now - geerlingguy was there a few years before I found it. reply jcdavis 17 hours agoprevBesides all his (excellent) tech stuff, I&#x27;m really thankful for Jeff being so public about his struggles with Crohn&#x27;s. I&#x27;m fortunate to have a far more moderate case, but in general there isn&#x27;t a ton of awareness about the disease and its super brave of him to use his platform to talk about his health issues. reply apple4ever 11 hours agoprevJeff is awesome! I met him at AnsibleFest 2022, and he was very friendly despite not feeling well (I did not take up much of his time when I realized that, FYI).Nobody even mentioned his books!

I always look forward to seeing his videos on YouTube. I’m really happy for him and his success. reply jchw 15 hours agoprev> Philosophically I can understand that stance, but don’t call it open source: call it ‘source available’Yep, agreed. Huge pet peeve of mine as well.It&#x27;s not like anyone&#x27;s under any obligations to provide any sort of rights, but at some point you have to admit that the term \"open source\" comes with a lot of expectations and norms that licenses like BSL just simply do not meet, and trying to call your project \"open source\" or call BSL in the \"spirit\" of open source is just misleading. reply uncomputation 18 hours agoprevCan the title be updated to include the “Meet”?

Skimming through that article, the articles linked at the bottom and some of Jeff’s comments and replies to the articles, he comes across way more hardcore and intense than the chill, wholesome guy I’m used to seeing. The stuff I just read was from over a decade ago, so maybe he’s changed, or maybe the only thing that’s changed is how outspoken he is about this. I like Jeff’s work, this bums me out. reply user_7832 16 hours agorootparentDo you know which article did the OP link? They&#x27;ve edited their comment. reply geerlingguy 16 hours agorootparentMost likely one of the blog posts I wrote in the early 00s about abortion.I started writing my blog in 2004, and decided to leave up almost everything from the earliest days when it was on Xanga, then Thingamablog (SSG before it was cool!), and now Drupal.Unlike most people, I&#x27;d rather be an open book. I figure intelligent people can understand how something written in high school&#x2F;college days two decades ago can reflect on personality, while also understanding that those words are likely not the same words the person would write today.It&#x27;s also why I leave up my very early YouTube videos. It&#x27;s not like everyone who has seen some success in their 30s&#x2F;40s popped out of the womb the way they are today! reply user_7832 16 hours agorootparentThanks for your reply. I&#x27;m curious to know if your views have changed in the years&#x2F;decade(s) since. (I&#x27;m asking specifically because there appear to be a few logical flaws in some of the arguments in one of your blog posts from 2009, at the risk of going significantly off topic for this HN thread) reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparentNot only is it off-topic, but I don&#x27;t think anyone is likely to learn anything interesting from a reply, and the most likely outcome is an abortion-related flamewar.I don&#x27;t agree with Jeff&#x27;s 2009 views on abortion, but it&#x27;s not really relevant to the work he&#x27;s done here, and neither is whether or not he&#x27;s changed his mind in any way about it. reply user_7832 9 hours agorootparentI mostly agree with your point about it being off topic. However I wonder what decides what’s the threshold to separate the art from the artist metaphorically speaking. Not that I don’t think the different shades of grey shouldn’t be discussed in general, but if this was someone else with more controversial issues (eg Stallman) the discussion would be different, and some&#x2F;many wouldn’t have considered that off topic to the discussion. Anyway, such things are fortunately not critical. (Fwiw I’m not particularly for or against what Jeff has written from an ideological view) replyDeIlliad 18 hours agoparentprevBefore clicking on the link I thought you meant he was writing articles on Ansible and putting his non-Ansible opinions in the same articles. I have no problem with him writing his thoughts on his blog, whether they are on Ansible, abortion, or anything else. reply throwaway6734 18 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s uncomfortable about it?

Not to say that he&#x27;s a bad dude...but be careful of who you listen to on the Internet. reply jchw 15 hours agoparentWhy do you feel it is particularly overblown? reply emptysongglass 14 hours agorootparentBecause so much of it was just completely false. Jeff positioned Red Hat as going against the community, which wasn&#x27;t the case at all. The \"bad actors\" were squarely Rocky and Alma who just wanted to sell the exact same ten year support enterprise Red Hat as Red Hat themselves without any work. Well, Red Hat said, you want it, you go get it in Stream, which has a 5 year lifecycle.The only companies that need ten year lifecycles are the same consumers Red Hat caters to with RHEL.Red Hat is continuing to honor all its licensing terms. It just isn&#x27;t doing its freeloading competitors any favors. And yes: they&#x27;re freeloaders.Red Hat&#x27;s choice never touched the community in any way. As a hobbyist who uses Red Hat stuff, I&#x27;m not using RHEL, and even if I was, Red Hat gives generous licenses for hobbyists like me.Jeff (and everybody else) jumped on the hate bandwagon. It wasn&#x27;t kind, it was mob behavior, and it completely lacked any nuance. reply geerlingguy 13 hours agorootparentThat sounds like some great revisionist history.Thousands of sysadmins, open source devs, even Hatters themselves used CentOS as a proxy for RHEL where they didn&#x27;t want to deal with licensing crap.In the middle of the CentOS 8 lifecycle, they converted CentOS to CentOS Stream (nobody asked for this), forcing everyone who had migrated their tooling and infra from CentOS 7 to 8 to migrate instead to... what?Rocky&#x2F;Alma stepped in and saved the day for all those folks.Then in the middle of the CentOS Stream 9 lifecycle, they hid some of the sources required for rebuilding a CentOS-equivalent (at least simply&#x2F;easily) behind a Red Hat account and told the community they should be happy with 16 dev licenses for RHEL if they truly needed RHEL compatibility.As I said then, \"no thanks.\" reply emptysongglass 13 hours ago[flagged]| rootparentnext [2 more] Jeff, plenty of smarter people than me came out against you to correct your crusade. As a practicing Christian, I&#x27;d expect more from you than coming out to lead a mob frothing at the mouth for blood. You didn&#x27;t even try and have a reasonable discourse with Red Hatters. As an influencer, you have a responsibility not to encourage this kind of social media vitriol that&#x27;s become all too common. It&#x27;s a contagion upon the human mind and you are directly responsible for whipping people up in this one. reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparent> plenty of smarter people than me came out against you to correct your crusade.Doesn&#x27;t mean they were right. reply jchw 13 hours agorootparentprev> Jeff (and everybody else) jumped on the hate bandwagon.

I&#x27;m not a huge follower of Jeff&#x27;s but I have never seen a single thing from them that I would consider \"hateful\" or jumping on a bandwagon.What I can gather is that you disagree with those who did not like Red Hat&#x27;s actions w.r.t. CentOS and RHEL updates, but just because you side with Red Hat here doesn&#x27;t really make the argument less valid, neither does unjustly categorizing it as hateful. (Or false.

Yes, it was a hate bandwagon and it wasn&#x27;t jumping on one, it was leading it. It was all over his LinkedIn and everywhere else he could post at the time. reply jchw 11 hours agorootparentSomething isn&#x27;t hateful just because you don&#x27;t like it or don&#x27;t agree with it. (It&#x27;s also not a bandwagon just because other people agree with it, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there at this point.) reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentprevI tend not to take seriously the opinions of people who call others who use open source software according to the terms of its license \"freeloaders\".(And I say this as an open source developer myself, who has spent thousands of hours writing code for free.)If you want to side with Red Hat on this, fine, but it&#x27;s not necessary to exaggerate the actions of those with an opposing view to the point that you&#x27;re trying to make them look bad.I also in general think it&#x27;s silly and unnecessary to defend a giant corporation (remember, IBM owns Red Hat now, and it&#x27;s not like RH had been a scrappy little Linux company for a long while before the acquisition, even) over regular ol&#x27; community members and IT sysadmins who have a beef. reply emptysongglass 12 hours agorootparentI also don&#x27;t believe in defending big corporate but Jeff&#x27;s takes were wildly out of touch with what was actually happening. I do not love Red Hat or any corporation and I think their messaging could have been a lot better but I don&#x27;t think the people who together make up Alma or Rocky acted in any way in good faith and I do find their desire to have everything hand prepared for them by Red Hat spoiled behavior.The sources are all still there, they just need to work a little harder to get it.

I was actually concerned that based on the brevity of the title that something tragic had happened. Glad that&#x27;s not the case! reply jgwil2 18 hours agoparentProbably the headline auto \"correcter\" lopped off the \"Meet\" part of the original title. Yet another example of that piece of software being too clever by half if you ask me. reply progbits 17 hours agorootparentThis is the stupidest HN feature. It does very little for clickbait (flagging and voting is better), and routinely screws up titles to the point it drastically changes or reverses their meaning. reply rbanffy 16 hours agorootparentWhen you submit it’s worth checking how much HN chewed up the title. I often face the need to fix it myself. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprevEh, it&#x27;s fine. It does help for many things, and if you don&#x27;t like the choice it&#x27;s made, you can edit it and it won&#x27;t butcher it again. reply nvy 17 hours agorootparentprevYep it&#x27;s a complete anti-feature and I have no idea why it&#x27;s still in use. reply dang 14 hours agorootparentAny feature is a \"complete anti-feature\" if you only count the things it gets wrong! The things it gets right mostly escape notice and never get commented on. It does a lot more good than bad, so keeping it is an easy call.Some of the things it gets wrong do stand out like sore thumbs. Then again, it&#x27;s probably good for the community to have something innocuous to hate. reply airstrike 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause you can edit the title after the fact? reply theodric 12 hours agorootparentIf - to paraphrase the other folks before me - it causes more annoyance than it does good, then the fact that one can spend more effort undoing its damage after the fact is, in fact, a bug rather than a feature. reply airstrike 11 hours agorootparentBut you&#x27;re only hearing from the people who are annoyed enough to write a comment complaining about it. Many other users (such as myself) may be +1 or +0 on the functionality, in which case you can&#x27;t conclude that \"it causes more annoyance than it does good\". You&#x27;d need to know user&#x27;s preferences (if you&#x27;re solving for that) or the value HN admin attributes to the feature vs. the value they attribute to the cost imposed on users (if you&#x27;re solving for that) replythibaut_barrere 18 hours agoparentprevSame, especially since he has shared a lot about his Crohn disease online https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffgeerling.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;crohns-disease-takes-... reply geerlingguy 17 hours agorootparentI should hope I have time to post more before I&#x27;d have anything too radical happen :DTypically with Crohn&#x27;s issues you have weeks or months of fun issues that lead up to anything too serious!

But it opened up a huge number of possibilities that I think will be realized on Pi 5 (and hopefully a CM5 eventually).And regarding power consumption &#x2F; efficiency, don&#x27;t forget about the usefulness of a full Linux computer running at less than a watt (like the Zero 2 W); or with the Pi 5 you can use the watchdog timer to boot and shut down now, going from idle at 2-3W to power off at 0.01W if you need a remote &#x27;edge&#x27; device.But the hardware and efficiency were never the primary drivers for Pi. It&#x27;s the fact you can buy one (well, sometimes...) and use it. You don&#x27;t have to spend a few hours getting the right OS, figuring out the right tools to flash it reading sparse forum-based documentation... reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentAnd even the Pi 4&#x27;s PCIe is fine for some things. I have a CM4-based NAS that I put together using Axzez&#x27;s Interceptor board (a big thank you, Jeff: I learned about it though one of your GitHub issues where you&#x27;d been cataloging CM4 carrier boards), and it&#x27;s just fine for spinning-rust hard drives. It isn&#x27;t maxing out their performance or anything, but it reads and writes fast enough for anything I need to do with it. reply kelnos 13 hours agoparentprevWhile Pi software support isn&#x27;t perfect (it&#x27;s a little baffling to me that there is still so much that hasn&#x27;t been upstreamed to mainline Linux in over a decade, but I digress), it&#x27;s generally light years ahead of the random SBCs you see from... wherever (yes, many from China, but there are others too). Armbian support is a plus, and many of them do run Armbian, but community support when you run into issues is very hit-or-miss. And manufacturer support is pretty much nonexistent for most of these. Some of that may just be language barrier, but the end result is the same. reply zlg_codes 14 hours agoparentprevThis is a weird subthread that smells like astroturfing. reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentYeah, it&#x27;s a little weird that it&#x27;s a throwaway account.

(Hopefully a WiFi HAT will make its way to the market with Intel AX210 or something like that). reply amluto 16 hours agorootparent [–] I actually meant this old USB issue:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;16&#x2F;exploring-the-raspberry-pi-4... reply geerlingguy 16 hours agorootparent [–] Ah yes, that one was pretty silly.

But thanks for the clarification. reply distcs 17 hours agoprevSince FreeBSD is on the front page today, I thought this is a good time to learn from the collective wisdom of this community. 5 simple questions to those who use FreeBSD to stir up a conversation.1. Where do you use FreeBSD? On your laptop? Remote servers? Routers?2. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of Linux?3. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of OpenBSD or another *BSD?4. Do you find something lacking in FreeBSD? Is there something that is good in another OS that you&#x27;d like to see in FreeBSD?5. What is that one thing about FreeBSD that you would hate to lose if you were forced to use another OS? reply drewg123 14 hours agoparent1) Desktop, many thousands of remote severs2) Poor interactions with Linus, DaveM, and the Linux community (see below)3) Performance4a) A different package system, more akin to Ubuntu LTS with PPAs, so we could have stable packages for 99% of things, but could get the latest versions of software when needed.4b) ebpf&#x2F;xdp5) Missing ^T (SIGINFO) support, simple init system, a kernel that makes sense2 extended: In 1994, I was a linux fanatic, with a stack of floppies I&#x27;d use to install linux on any pc I could get my hands on. I landed a job as a sysadmin for a stats dept, where we were using ancient DECstations running ULTRIX. Disk space was expensive, and TeX fonts were large. So we kept TeX fonts centrally located in NFS. The DECstations were old and slow compared to PCs (12.5MHz mips, vs 66Mhz 486), so I wanted to replace them with PCs running Linux. The problem came that it took the DECs ~1 second to render latex .dvi file using xdvi. It took a linux box a minute or more. This was because the DECs did NFS file caching, while Linux didn&#x27;t, and xdvi seeked around at random in the font files.I went to the 1994 Boston USENIX and met Linus at the Linux BOF. I asked him about NFS file caching. He said something like \"bah, nobody uses NFS, we have no plans to implement any sort of NFS caching, its not important\".. So I got up, went to the FreeBSD BOF, and they said it should work just fine. I&#x27;ve been a FreeBSD user ever since.Then ~10 years later, working for a company making one of the first 10GbE NICs, I had submitted our base driver and got it accepted via the netdev list. I then completed work on TCP LRO in our driver, submitted that, and got it NACK&#x27;ed for the reasonable reason that they didn&#x27;t want to have multiple LRO implementations. EVEN THOUGH OUR COMPETITOR&#x27;S DRIVER HAD THEIR OWN LRO IN THEIR DRIVER, AND ANOTHER VENDOR SUBMITTED A DRIVER WITH THE BASE DRIVER AND LRO IN THE SAME PATCH AFTER US AND GOT IT ACCEPTED, AND THEY DIDNT RIP LRO OUT OF THE OTHER DRIVERS. So our driver had dog-shit performance out of the box due to a lack of LRO as compared to 2 of our competitors. At that point I was pretty much done with Linux.Compared to FreeBSD, where we had the best LRO in our driver, and a few other vendors copy&#x2F;pasted it, and it wound up eventually being centralized as tcp_lro.c and driver-specific LRO ripped out. reply gruturo 16 hours agoparentprev1. 2 laptops and quite a few servers, some remote, some local2. While I prefer FreeBSD, I use Linux too. I think it&#x27;s important to know more than one OS. Also my employer standardized on RHEL, not much choice there3. It seems to be the one where most of the (non-strictly-security-related) innovation takes place, and many of the OpenBSD security related innovation trickle down reasonably soon.4. Docker (hate it, love it, but so much software is distributed in this way now), recent WiFi adapters&#x2F;standards5. ZFS (I know it&#x27;s possible on Linux too now, but good luck convincing my employer, anything not covered by support is a tough cookie there), ZFS, ZFS, dtrace, its very nice update&#x2F;upgrade process, a sane and quite rich base system, the Ports collection, its very nice handbook and documentation. reply wkat4242 16 hours agoparentprevI use FreeBSD on my desktop. Not on a laptop because I hate laptops.I love it because it&#x27;s so simple and free of corporate influence compared to Linux. I hate corporations telling me what I should use (eg systemd).I use FreeBSD because it has the biggest software support. Using it with KDE.I love the ports collection, the separation between stable OS and rolling packages, excellent documentation, jails and ZFS and bectl.I don&#x27;t find anything lacking.

On my desktop.2. As of right now, mostly curiosity. I have dabbled in FreeBSD on and off for years, and every time I install something from scratch I give it another go. In addition, the experience is more cohesive and \"it just works\" compared to almost every Linux distro I&#x27;ve ever used (the closest I&#x27;ve found is Slackware.) Let me explain.When I say cohesive, I mean mostly that it has extremely well thought out documentation, and most common things you might want to do are in the FreeBSD handbook. Just go to the relevant chapter and read up.When I say \"it just works\", I don&#x27;t mean that the out of the box experience is just magically perfect and pre-configured like you might see on Windows or Ubuntu. What I mean is, the ports (and the pre-compiled packages made from them) are extremely reliable. You install them, and they work. Not to pick on Ubuntu specifically, but I have found this not to be the case more often on Ubuntu. Sometimes you install a package on Ubuntu, and it doesn&#x27;t just work, and you might have to hunt down a config file to make some adjustments, its location may or may not be different from vanilla and may or may not be documented, or maybe it&#x27;s a bad package and you&#x27;re SOL.Furthermore, I&#x27;ve found that upgrading ports and packages in FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t break things anywhere near as often as on most Linux distros I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very reliable in that sense, and it just works.3. This is older hardware for personal use, and I don&#x27;t really need the enhanced security of OpenBSD, especially the enhanced security that comes with a performance cost.As for NetBSD or DragonflyBSD, I have the impression, which may or may not be correct, that FreeBSD has better hardware support than either of them, and I want all of my peripherals to work.4. I do most of my gaming on dedicated hardware these days (Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch), but it would be super great if the experience of playing games was more smooth. Thanks to the magic of Linux binary compatibility and Proton, you can totally play Windows and Linux games on FreeBSD with decent success, but the process of setting that up is awkward and ad-hoc.5. See 2. Also, I like ZFS a lot, and I get the impression that getting up and running with ZFS on Linux is more of a hassle. reply kipukun 17 hours agoparentprev1. I use it on all of my servers.2. FreeBSD offers a coherent base system with sane tools. pf is a godsend, and the ports collection is a good trade-off of configuration and simplicity. ZFS used to be a killer feature but is being integrated into Linux systems.3. FreeBSD is designed around \"general purpose\" use and has a lot of backing from corporations like Netflix.4. FreeBSD is missing a true container solution that is compatible with Docker (jails don&#x27;t count). There has been some work on this as of the most recent BSDcon, so I&#x27;m hopeful.5. I never want to look at iptables again.EDIT: fix spacing reply pseudostem 17 hours agoparentprev1. Servers, I&#x27;m partial to openBSD because of a saner IMO &#x2F;etc and works-out-of-the-box (for me). My coworker is the more freebsd kind and since he does the work, his opinion prevails.2. I moved houses 3 days ago. Had installed MX linux prior to moving on my desktop computer. Today, no DHCP IP on my computer. Man and apropos didn&#x27;t help much. Ifconfig, arp don&#x27;t exist. They require an apt install. I&#x27;m clueless as to what&#x27;s happening. GUI tools didn&#x27;t help much. So yeah to all predictable systems including windows.3. VSCode (which when I last checked a week ago didn&#x27;t work on freebsd either) and a lot of other programs which aren&#x27;t there on OpenBSD. NetBSD haven&#x27;t touched, so won&#x27;t comment.4. Userland stuff. BSDs in general pitch themselves as complete OSs, but the whole getting X working is like assembling a GUI stack IMO.5. Continuing from the previous point (yeah, I&#x27;m a hypocrite), a few hundred MBs of RAM and very little GHzs on the CPU gets you a fully functional Desktop environment. If a browser is needed, add a bit more RAM and maybe some CPU.PS: I use really old hardware reply shiomiru 16 hours agorootparent> BSDs in general pitch themselves as complete OSs, but the whole getting X working is like assembling a GUI stack IMO.FWIW, NetBSD comes with X & ctwm out of the box. (But of course it&#x27;s not the same as a whole DE you get in Debian.) reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentprevVscode works totally fine, I use it all the time. It&#x27;s in the packages and ports. reply pseudostem 16 hours agorootparentI might be wrong, but VSCode didn&#x27;t work (for me) on 13.x and I ran across a few forum posts for others who couldn&#x27;t get it done either. I had very little time to figure out the right \"distro\", and VSCode was a requirement. Went to distrowatch, and installed the top choice (please don&#x27;t roast me about it). reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentHmm weird. Did you try to just do \"sudo pkg install vscode\" ?Don&#x27;t try to download it from the website, this won&#x27;t work as freebsd is not a supported platform but it&#x27;s simply in the package collection and works great as such. reply wkat4242 8 hours agorootparentprevPs I wasn&#x27;t trying to roast you at all. I&#x27;m happy you found a solution even if it&#x27;s not FreeBSD1. Where do you use FreeBSD? On your laptop? Remote servers? Routers?Right now, I run FreeBSD on a few machines: my rented server, my two home servers which also do redundant PPPoE + NAT, a NAT machine at my MIL&#x27;s that I also use for offsite backup of my home servers (I don&#x27;t trust the rented server enough to run backups there), additionally, I have two mini PCs setup to run mythtv frontend (but the backend is not currently running, because our tv habits have changed). My desktops are Windows. My wireless access points and I think my managed network switches are Linux, so is the ISP provided DSL modem and LTE to network device (which I believe also runs embedded Android on the actual modem). I do have an old acer chromebook that boots FreeBSD, but I haven&#x27;t used it in a while (my son used it for minecraft until an update changed a library and made it too hard to get working)2. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of Linux?I had great experiences with FreeBSD at Yahoo and WhatsApp, and bad experiences with systemd when Debian adopted it, so I decided to switch. And I&#x27;ve been mostly happy. Going between Yahoo and WhatsApp, I jumped about three major versions of FreeBSD in a weekend, and everything felt the same, but better. Jumping between major releases of Debian, lots of things feel different and sometimes better, sometimes worse, sometimes the same; I felt a lot of major changes I was dealing with were complicating my system to deal with use cases I didn&#x27;t care about, and that a lot of the worse offenders were coming from the same developers and I was tired of dealing with their software and tired of trying to get things to work without it.3. Why do you use FreeBSD instead of OpenBSD or another *BSD?IMHO, FreeBSD is focused on being practical and also has a performance focus. OpenBSD has a very opinionated security focus, which I apprechiate, but features needed for performance are missing and unlikely to arrive; I&#x27;m more willing to compromise security than performance, so there you go. I mentally associate NetBSD with portability, but I&#x27;m not running FreeBSD on exotic equipment, and not interested in fighting with my embedded Linux devices to get them to run software of my choice: been there, done that, I&#x27;d rather tilt at different windmills now.4. Do you find something lacking in FreeBSD? Is there something that is good in another OS that you&#x27;d like to see in FreeBSD?Hardware support is hit or miss. I have usb 2.5G nics I can&#x27;t use that I thought I&#x27;d be able to (but didn&#x27;t check, and I have other uses for, so no big deal). HDMI audio on certain generations of intel chips is difficult because the graphics and audio drivers need to coordinate on clock settings, but there&#x27;s no mechanism for that in FreeBSD, the Linux gpu driver is shimmed into the FreeBSD kernel, so that makes it trickier than it maybe already was. I had trouble getting FreeBSD installed on the chromebook I mentioned originally, but it did get fixed.Not having a large user community makes it hard for hardware&#x2F;software providers to get excited about providing support, because they don&#x27;t get a sense of return on investment.5. What is that one thing about FreeBSD that you would hate to lose if you were forced to use another OS?Stability of experience. I know that 90-95% of the skills and knowledge I develop on FreeBSD will apply to future releases. I&#x27;ve had to learn firewalls on Linux three times (of course, FreeBSD also has three firewalls, but they are all supported and all kind of different; I simultaneously use pf, because of pfsync which provides for seamless NAT failover and ipfw to do traffic shaping and network delay simulstions; I&#x27;ve never used ipf, but I assume it provides value to some), and I work with mixed versions of Linux for work and have to deal with sometimes ip, sometimes ifconfig, sometimes netstat, sometimes ss on a regular basis, and it makes no sense. FreeBSD has the same needs for interface config and routing and socket listing, and made the existing tools do it, rather than new tools that work the same but different. Who has time for that? If FreeBSD ends, which I don&#x27;t expect it to, I&#x27;ll just go live in a cave with the final release and the best computer I can put together that&#x27;s supported by the final release, and that will be my computing for the rest of my time. Honestly, while I sure computing will continue to develop, a big beefy box purchased today should get me a long time of continued use, so I&#x27;ll be fine. When it falls apart, maybe there will be a retro marketplace, or maybe I&#x27;ll move to assisted living. reply dveeden2 19 hours agoprevRelease Notes:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;releases&#x2F;14.0R&#x2F;relnotes&#x2F; reply nivenhuh 16 hours agoprevI’ve been evaluating FreeBSD, and the primary thing that I miss is the ease of use that comes with using docker images.The jails system + zfs is pretty nice.

Some of these changes were cherry-picked into the stable&#x2F;13 branch and were included in the FreeBSD 13.1 and FreeBSD 13.2 minor releases built from there.A sibling comment notes that APIs or ABIs may change between major versions. This is true, but this is not the reason for a new major version. Rather, ABI and API changes are allowed during the development cycle on the main branch, but are not cherry-picked into the existing stable branches.I have a proposed change to include in the release notes some significant changes that happened to have been merged into 13.x already, and so far have been excluded from 14.0&#x27;s notes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviews.freebsd.org&#x2F;D42546 reply throw0101b 19 hours agoparentprevAPIs are stable with-in major version numbers.

His reasoning boiled down to \"Linux is too popular\". The consequences of this choice would be significant, and that just isn&#x27;t a justified position so I bowed out. The project, unsurprisingly, was a failure. reply LeonenTheDK 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m curious if you could talk about any of the consequences at all. There&#x27;s a very similar situation unfolding at my company currently. New project running on FreeBSD because that&#x27;s what the admin likes, and he takes every opportunity to bash Linux that he can. I&#x27;d like to prepare for potential pitfalls best I can.We&#x27;ve already had issues around compatibility with third party software and OS upgrades (which surprised me in particular, likely a mistake on the admin&#x27;s part but I&#x27;m not privy to the details).FreeBSD seems like a wonderful OS for purpose-built hardware (eg pfsense, PlaystationOS, Netflix&#x27;s distribution servers), but I&#x27;d much prefer to be on something common for the general compute. I don&#x27;t even want to know what hiring another&#x2F;replacement admin will be like in the future (we&#x27;re entirely on-prem in a city that&#x27;s away from a major population centre, niche enough as it is without adding FreeBSD on top). reply toast0 17 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m curious if you could talk about any of the consequences at all.One major consequence is that your software and setup scripts are likely to continue to work over many major releases. Basic system tools don&#x27;t often get replaced, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about migrating to a new tool to configure interfaces, or a new firewall (although you do have three firewalls to choose from, they all have been there for a long time) or a drastically new init system etc.Otoh, there are many projects that are made for Linux only. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. Lots of assumptions creep in, people write Makefiles that need GNU make, and call make recursively with &#x27;make&#x27; instead of $(MAKE), but FreeBSD has BSD make as make, and GNU make, if you install it, as gmake. FreeBSD sets up cc to be llvm&#x27;s clang, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s common in Linux. Many projects compile with either, but some don&#x27;t. Specialized linking is tricky. Compiler and linker changes are probably an exception to my rule earlier about not replacing tools, but there&#x27;s a case to be made that clang is at least as good as gcc, and the license is a better fit; there&#x27;s no requirement that the base be all BSD licensed, but it&#x27;s nice to move in that direction where possible.System monitoring is different, but capabilities are roughly similar. FreeBSD has some nice things, and Linux has some nice things, I&#x27;ve got my preferences, but whatever.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to take a reasonable systems aware person and sit them down with a FreeBSD book and a FreeBSD system and get acceptable results. Yes, mastery takes time, but consultancies are available if you need mastery right now, and don&#x27;t have time to develop it in house. reply doublerabbit 18 hours agorootparentprevNormally the reasons for me don&#x27;t tend to fit those who use Linux.

The biggest frustration I have is \"linux recipes\" for doing things often don&#x27;t work (naturally, since the OS is different), and electron apps are a crapshoot, since the electron is chrome, and the emulation needed for chrome is incomplete. For example, I&#x27;m listening to spotify right now and I can listen to playlists, but can&#x27;t just play a song..EDIT: One the things I loved about Ubuntu LTS is the packages being essentially frozen, aside from security fixes. FreeBSD is a \"rolling release\" OS for 3rd party packages, even on stable branches. That&#x27;s one of the reasons that I use the ubuntu LTS firefox ... I can apt-get update & apt-get upgrade just the web browser and its dependencies, rather than the 1700 unrelated packages that I&#x27;d need to update just to get the newest firefox. reply wkat4242 8 hours agorootparentVscode is also Electron and works great though. Chromium itself too.For Spotify I use spotify-qt which is ok (not great) though with the latest version from ports it refuses to store my password in the KDE keychain any longer :(Ps I actually love the rolling packages on FreeBSD while keeping a stable OS.

Things were different around 10, but nowadays, the support expectations are pretty clear[1]. FreeBSD 12 support ends at the end of this year, so not a good choice for new users; FreeBSD 13 support is expected to end in January 2026, so if you install today, you don&#x27;t need a major update for about two years. That&#x27;s plenty of time to try it and see if you like it. If there&#x27;s a critical feature in the upcoming release that you&#x27;d like, RCs are available in advance of release, but IMHO, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that as a matter of course for a new user; sometimes RCs have rough edges and that&#x27;s not a great intro.

    "title": "Apple Asked Amazon to Block Rival Ads, Raising Concerns of Unfair Advantage",
    "originLink": "https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gives-apple-special-treatment-while-others-suffer-junk-ads-2023-11",
    "originBody": "Amazon; Insider Redeem now Unlike most other brands, Apple search results and product pages on Amazon have few, if any, rival ads. Apple previously asked Amazon for this special treatment, an internal email shows. Having no ads can lead to faster page loads, and potentially higher sales of Apple products. In its recent lawsuit against Amazon, the Federal Trade Commission accused the company and former CEO Jeff Bezos of flooding the e-commerce site with irrelevant \"junk ads\" to boost profit. One part of Amazon's vast marketplace appears to be exempt from that move: Apple product pages. Apple's latest products directly sold by Amazon have a much cleaner page layout on Amazon with no ads or recommendations until the very bottom of the page, an Insider review of the e-commerce site shows. Most other brands don't get this special treatment, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Other companies's product pages are cluttered with a mix of ads and product recommendations from competitors or sometimes irrelevant brands. For example, Samsung Galaxy and Microsoft Surface product pages on Amazon have multiple banner ads, including a list of sponsored recommendations under tabs like, \"Products related to this item\" or \"4 stars and above.\" The latest Apple product pages on Amazon have none of this extra marketing. The discrepancy has drawn ire from some of Apple's biggest competitors, including Samsung, one of the people said. Clean iPhone searches Search results for \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\" on Amazon also offer a similarly clean experience. The top banner is always an Apple ad, and only one banner ad appears at the very bottom of the page, according to Insider's recent review. In contrast, Amazon search results for other brands, such as Samsung and Sony, show at least two or three sponsored ads from rivals. Amazon also shows a fewer number of search results for Apple's products compared to its competitors. \"It's clear Apple made a deal with Amazon that is not available to other brands,\" Juozas Kaziukenas, CEO of e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse, told Insider. \"I can't recall any other brand with the same setup.\" Private demands The unusual arrangement follows the iPhone-maker's private demands to Amazon to only show its products in results when an Apple term like \"iPad\" is searched, according to an internal email previously shared by the House Judiciary Committee. At the time, Apple also asked Amazon to make its product pages clean, without any non-Apple product recommendations. The email, titled \"WW framework terms,\" shows a list of discussion points prior to a broader partnership deal struck between Apple and Amazon in 2018. That deal for the first time let Amazon directly sell a broader range of Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad, and put in anti-counterfeit measures like only letting authorized merchants sell Apple products on Amazon's marketplace. \"We understand that Apple does not want to drive sales to competing brands in search or detail pages,\" Amazon's retail CEO at the time, Jeff Wilke, wrote in the email. Apple's request is particularly notable given how Amazon has increasingly put more ads across its marketplace, as the FTC lawsuit alleged. Amazon's advertising unit is a key growth and profit driver, with over $38 billion in revenue last year. But stuffing its website with ads risks alienating brands and imposing extra costs on merchants. It also has the potential to confuse consumers — something that Apple was likely trying to avoid. Comparison of Apple and Samsung's product detail pages on Amazon Amazon/Insider In an email to Insider, Apple acknowledged that a 2018 agreement with Amazon prevents other brands from buying ads on the e-commerce site for a few specific Apple-related brand queries. The company added that third-party brands are still able to buy ads on Amazon for generic keywords containing an Apple name. Marketplace Pulse's Kaziukenas said that means brands can buy ads on general terms, like an \"iPhone 15 pro case,\" but not for specific queries like \"iPhone\" on Amazon's marketplace. Apple's goal was to create the best possible customer experience, and other companies are free to do the same, Apple's representative added. Spokespeople for Amazon and Samsung didn't respond to requests for comment. 'Counterfeit and safety issues' Apple also told Insider that the 2018 agreement with Amazon sought to address significant counterfeit and safety issues on Amazon's marketplace. Prior to the deal, Apple sent hundreds of thousands of take-down notices to Amazon to reduce counterfeits, and the company conducted test purchases on Amazon that consistently returned high counterfeit rates, Apple added. These moves helped Apple materially reduce the number of counterfeit and unsafe Apple products on Amazon, the iPhone maker said. 'Compensate Amazon for the lost ad revenue' Back in 2018, Amazon appears to have initially refused Apple's request, but left open the possibility of working out a financial arrangement, according to the email shared by the House Judiciary Committee. \"We cannot alter our organic search algorithm to return only Apple products in the search results when an Apple team is searched,\" Amazon's then-retail CEO Jeff Wilke wrote in the email. (\"Organic search\" refers to pure search results that don't include ads). Wilke also wrote that Amazon does not block or limit advertising on product \"detail\" pages. But Apple could potentially pay up for this to happen, he added. \"Apple would need to purchase these placements or compensate Amazon for the lost ad revenue,\" Wilke wrote in the email. An internal Amazon email. House Judiciary Committee Some parts of the email were redacted, and the exact details of that deal could not be learned. But the advertising component was one of the many parts of the broader agreement, according to a person familiar with the matter. This person said Apple is getting a \"massive preferential treatment\" on Amazon. Apple is extremely sensitive about the brand experience on Amazon and does not want \"pesky\" competition clogging its product detail page, this person added. Digital end cap Retailers have for years offered special promotional spots in physical stores, like end caps, where certain products get exclusive placements. Amazon's treatment of Apple's latest products may be seen as a digital version of that. But it's unclear if Amazon makes this special Apple arrangement available to other brands selling on its site. An Insider review of some of the latest products from Samsung, Microsoft, Bose, Sony, and LG show plenty of sponsored ads and recommendation widgets on their Amazon product and search-result pages. A source of frustration The special treatment is a source of frustration for some of Apple's competitors. Samsung, for example, complained about this, one of the people said, because it's not something you can simply negotiate with Amazon's advertising team. \"I'm surprised — that's strange,\" a former senior Amazon advertising manager told Insider, referring to Apple's clean product and search result pages. \"I wouldn't have the discretion to offer something like that.\" Comparison of Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy search results on Amazon Amazon/Insider At least half a dozen salespeople on Amazon's advertising team told Insider that they were not able to extend this Apple-style special treatment to their clients. Large advertisers on Amazon constantly ask for this type of exclusivity, but the company usually denies those requests because it wants a diverse set of search results and ads, one of the people said. To create Apple's clean product and search pages, multiple teams at the most senior levels at Amazon would have had to get involved, this person added. \"We balk at companies that want to buy all the ad slots,\" this person said. \"I have never seen, nor do I have the control to give, that type of right.\" 'Junk ads' The special treatment given to Apple is very different from Amazon's broader mandate to accept more ads on its marketplace, even if that hurts the customer experience, a practice alleged in detail in the FTC's filing last week. The FTC said Amazon not only increased the number of ads on its e-commerce site in recent years, but also the number of \"irrelevant junk ads,\" internally called \"defects.\" It accused Bezos of encouraging the company to do more of this to increase profitability, according to the filing. \"Mr. Bezos instructed his executives to '[a]ccept more defects' because Amazon can extract billions of dollars through increased advertising despite worsening its services for customers,\" the FTC filing said. Amazon has tried to address this issue. In recent years, the company tested a new search offering that worked similarly to Apple's arrangement in order to get rid of irrelevant ads, one of the people said. For example, if a shopper searched for \"Adidas,\" Amazon would return only Adidas products because customers complained about unrelated product ads or recommendations, this person said. The test no longer seems to be in place, an Insider review of Amazon's marketplace search results suggested. Potential sales boost The cleaner search and product pages for Apple may have led to one additional benefit: increased sales. Internal data at Amazon shows faster page loads typically lead to higher sales, even if the difference is only a millisecond, one of the people said. Since Apple's pages are not clogged by a bunch of ads and product recommendations, its products and search results show up faster on Amazon and lead to a better customer experience — resulting in potentially higher sales. \"Amazon is not neutral,\" this person said. \"It's more biased towards Apple.\" Do you work at Amazon?

Amazon refuses to hold themselves accountable for the products they sell—they advertise one thing but sell you another, clearly indicating they have no idea what they&#x27;re actually selling.2. Apple relies on legal protections to artificially inflate the pricing of their products. AirPods aren&#x27;t much better than bluetooth headphones sold for a tenth the price, and they are straight-up inferior to the products of competitors with a third their price. If the superiority of their own products were so obvious the branding wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all. And don&#x27;t even get me started on how they force consumers to buy their hardware to get access to their software, which should be forced to be sold on the open market along side their competitors.Now of course we need to fix the first issue to fix the second one, but the second issue has far more destructive consequences. reply jtbayly 13 hours agoparentprevnext [8 more] I didn&#x27;t read the whole article, but it seemed focused on (missing) advertisements, not on counterfeits. reply BugsJustFindMe 13 hours agorootparent> I didn&#x27;t read the whole articleThat&#x27;s rectifiable. reply robwwilliams 12 hours agorootparentGreat response! reply QuantumGood 8 hours agorootparentitsrectifiable.com is available. reply CoastalCoder 6 hours agorootparentI really, really hope it&#x27;s bought by an analog electronics manufacturer. reply twothamendment 7 hours agorootparentprevWas available...For the right price, it is rectifiable. reply nemo 13 hours agorootparentprevThe advertisements were what was driving the counterfeiting.

Usually Amazon literally returns the money when the delivery person picks up the item from my doorstep.But with this Amazon required a scheduled pickup with UPS, did not acknowledge receiving the item even though UPS showed it as received and a few weeks later they are still asking me to wait for 1 month before contacting them for any information.Well, I filed a chargeback with my credit card and automagically the errors in their system got resolved, and the item shows as received (on the correct date 2+ weeks ago), and they are promising a refund in a week (as opposed to 2.5 more weeks).Looks like they’re not just giving Apple preferential treatment but going out of their way to protect Apple. reply stouset 2 hours agoparentNo, they’re protecting themselves against a significant volume of fraudsters who order genuine high-value goods and return counterfeits. These people are more than capable of re-shrinkwrapping boxes after opening them.It’s likely there’s a significant queue of potential counterfeits that Amazon needs to go through. If you bought&#x2F;returned this during a period of otherwise-high volume (e.g., right after a release), there’s a particularly high chance that the volume of “real” returns temporarily swamped their normal capacity. Or maybe their capacity just lags behind what it ought to be.Either way, they’re protecting themselves and this almost certainly has nothing to do with Apple specifically. reply Alupis 5 hours agoparentprevNormally Amazon bans your account (and that means you, personally, since it&#x27;s difficult to open a second account) from ever using amazon.com ever again if you successfully charge back something.The only recourse is to pay them the charged back amount...Experienced this first hand with actual fraud that was reported to Amazon moments after it occurred, yet still received a lifetime ban until my fraud dispute was settled. reply forty 3 hours agorootparentI banned myself from using Amazon several years ago.

If they sell it, they make the difference between real and counterfeit in profit less shipping. reply stouset 2 hours agorootparentYep.

Most merchants respond to that sort of behaviour by dictating to you that they will no longer do business with you. reply bbarnett 27 minutes agorootparentWhile you may be accurately depicting the situation, as viewed by some merchants, it&#x27;s not the reality.A merchant enters into the world of credit card payments knowing full well chargebacks are a thing. And most people won&#x27;t go there, unless the merchant won&#x27;t act appropriately.For example, Amazon. A black hole of information. It&#x27;s very hard to even find a &#x27;contact&#x27; button that doesn&#x27;t lead to a chatbot with relentlessly circular menus.They funnel you into multiple choice hell, and the wrong choice gives a lame answer, with no way to chat a person. You have to restart the whole menu process to try a different tact.Amazon actively, aggressively tries to ignore you. They do not provide customer service except under duress.Note that they keep doubling down on this! Year after year, it is harder and harder to get resolution for outside the box issues they cause.I know so many people that have no idea how to ever contact amazon, if something bad has happened. That have tried, and get lost in menu hell.And even if you manage to get past this, and finally start chatting with an actual person, they have a very hard time helping you if the problem is outside the box.You&#x27;ll have your chat session \"transferred\" to someone else, and have to explain all over again. Yup, they can read the log but often don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had a chat session with 4 or 5 transfers, and then had it die.Leaving me to start all over again.Amazon is the worst for customer support. The worst. They deserve chargebacks.And the post you&#x27;re replying to was right to do so. If the merchant cannot give clear, concise answers, and explain what is happening in your specific case, it&#x27;s on them. And amazon chat personnel will just cite company policy.We all need to say that we don&#x27;t care, Mr Merchant, if you&#x27;re trying to scale. If you&#x27;re doing so as \"cost saving measures\". Screw you, Merchant, provide customer support!And it&#x27;s getting to the point that we should legislate this, specifically for large corps. reply Eisenstein 8 hours agoparentprevIf you are interested in continuing to do business with Amazon I would do some research into how they treat customers that have filed chargebacks against them. I don&#x27;t personally have experience with this but it is probable that you will end up on their shit list and any further customer service actions may skew outside of you getting any benefit of the doubt or other considerations. reply userinanother 6 hours agorootparentTheir customer service has gone to shit.

Why do it sneakily? Why not have a page somewhere on Amazon that says \"hey, if you want us to remove ads from your product listings, pay us [10x the total lifetime amount we expect to get in ad revenue from running ads on the page] per product page\". Most companies wouldn&#x27;t do it, so it wouldn&#x27;t change Amazon&#x27;s model much at all. Meanwhile, Apple could afford it trivially. While sleazy, it would be a completely legal offering that would never come back to bite them in the butt. reply ribosometronome 12 hours agoparentIt sounds like you are saying that businesses should only be able to sell services that they publicly advertise with prices.

After all, when you catch someone doing something unethical, it is often the tip of the iceberg. It would be very easy for two tech execs to communicate privately and come to an agreement like \"Stop investing in Bing and we&#x27;ll stop investing in GSuite.\"We&#x27;ve been through a long period of stagnation from big tech companies, often blamed on cultural problems in a maturing industry. What if the real story is a level of cartelisation far beyond anything revealed so far? reply SllX 2 hours agoparentNot saying there isn&#x27;t collusion in the Valley but a negotiated deal with a signed contract complete with paper trail and with both companies, employees and former employees admitting that such a deal exists even if they can&#x27;t discuss the details when asked about it isn&#x27;t exactly the definition of collusion. It&#x27;s an agreement. In fact, if the alternative was that Apple goes to war with Amazon in court over the number of counterfeit Apple products Amazon was selling (or allowing third parties to sell through Amazon) and Apple can build a strong enough case for a court to take it, then a signed agreement before litigation can even begin is a positive outcome from a court&#x27;s perspective because even if litigation did begin, the court would be spending some time encouraging the parties to negotiate a settlement rather than dragging this out when the court could be hearing other cases.Collusion is illegal and typically done in secret because its illegal, like when Apple, Google, Pixar and some others (I forgot who else, Google it) were suppressing wages–that was collusion. Signing contracts and making deals with other Fortune 500 companies operating in the same sector, even for things that neither company would typically offer to anyone else, is not. reply alberth 13 hours agoprevDumb question: why is this not allowed?Presumably, Apple paid Amazon to reduce the number of ads.What&#x27;s so wrong about that?All companies allow large enterprise customers (who drive high revenue), to have custom &#x2F; tailored offerings based on their requests. reply paxys 12 hours agoparentThe issue is primarily about counterfeiting, which is illegal regardless of the companies involved and the deals between them.Samsung has an Amazon store, and other companies bid for ad spots shown right on the official store page which link to illegal knockoffs of Samsung products. Samsung complains, and Amazon says \"sorry we can&#x27;t help it, that&#x27;s just how things work\".Then Apple comes along, and Amazon magically cleans up their store page (demonstrating that they have the ability to do so), but leaves the rest of them as-is.So now the take away is – if you don&#x27;t sign an exclusive agreement with Amazon they will give counterfeiters full access to your products and customers, and that can be easily challenged in court (which is exactly what the FTC is doing right now). reply scarface_74 12 hours agorootparentApple doesn’t have an exclusive agreement with Amazon for online sales.I agree though bidding on a trademark where you can advertise as a competitor when someone explicitly searches for a brand should be considered copyright infringement.It’s definitely a horrible user experience - Apple, Google, and Amazon all do it reply lovepronmostly 5 hours agorootparentApple does it in the app store.

Use kagi.com and it&#x27;s not a problem. reply bhelkey 5 hours agorootparent> Search terms feel like a different thing.Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, this discussion is about search ads. The situation was that users searched for Apple products and were shown counterfeit competitors. reply smoldesu 12 hours agoparentprevSo if I search Amazon for \"Tylenol\", you&#x27;re saying the experience is better if they don&#x27;t show me bulk acetaminophen?

What&#x27;s wrong with comparing products across brands? reply fallingknife 10 hours agoparentprevCompetitors to a trademarked brand should absolutely be able to purchase ads against that brand. reply 38 13 hours agoprev> As detailed by today’s report, the agreement between Apple and Amazon includes a carveout that reduces the number of ads and recommendations that appear on product pages for Apple devices. While Amazon product pages are generally full of ads, sponsored results, and recommendations, Apple’s product pages show only one banner ad at the very bottom of the page.> In contrast, product pages for Apple competitors like Samsung are riddled with ads from competitors, recommendations, and other sponsored banners. Insider says that other companies, including Samsung, have complained about the preferential treatment given to Apple. reply wnevets 13 hours agoprevAmazon knows all about of the garbage being sold on its site but only does something about it if you&#x27;re a massive tech company who threatens to sue, very cool.I wonder how many of these thumb drives are legit. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=2+tb+thumb+drive&crid=YZ410MSN6L1... reply ren_engineer 12 hours agoparentmy question is why hasn&#x27;t the FBI seized every Amazon warehouse for knowingly selling counterfeit goods? They do this routinely for smaller businesses selling fake stuff reply kube-system 11 hours agorootparentBecause they don&#x27;t \"knowingly sell counterfeit goods\". Amazon employees don&#x27;t create these listings, other people do.Someone that \"knowingly sells counterfeit goods\" is humanly aware that a specific item they are selling is counterfeit, and decide to sell it anyway, which is not the case here.These listings are taken down whack-a-mole style as Amazon is made humanly aware of their existence. reply JKCalhoun 11 hours agorootparentSounds like Amazon should vet the items before allowing them be listed.Strange how easy it is to brush off accountability and still make a profit off of illegalities. reply kube-system 10 hours agorootparentThat is a fair position. I was commenting on how \"knowingly\" works. reply Regnore 11 hours agorootparentprevDoes Amazon do literally anything to pro-actively prevent the selling of counterfeit goods?> Prior to the deal, Apple sent “hundreds of thousands of take-down notices” to Amazon to reduce counterfeits, and the company conducted test purchases on Amazon that “consistently returned high counterfeit rates reply TheCowboy 9 hours agorootparentIt has become increasingly difficult to operate as a 3rd party seller on their platform. A lot of categories and items are \"gated\" requiring a lot of additional approval or limited access that&#x27;s difficult to come by.For example, there are books I purchased off of Amazon, directly from Amazon as new books, that I am not allowed to sell as used on their site. This wasn&#x27;t always the case. reply dbcurtis 10 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever gotten counterfeit Amazon Basics products? I thought not. Amazon could shut this down of they actually cared. reply paulryanrogers 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d argue commingling inventory \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" is tacitly endorsing counterfeiting. reply bmitc 8 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like using scale as an excuse. reply StopHammoTime 7 hours agorootparentThe law is the problem.The law requires explicit knowledge, so Amazon can get away with it.I don’t agree with it, but lawmakers should be making these changes. reply vuln 8 hours agorootparentprevTry that argument with the Silk Road. Has Apple or Amazon hired or solicited hitmen? Probably. reply hedora 7 hours agorootparentprevAmazon invented a new category of business for itself. It claims it is not a store or a retailer, or even a distributor in the conventional sense of the word.If it were any of those things, it would be liable for safety issues of the products it sells, among other things.I suspect “other things” includes “knowingly operating a cartel that violates patent and copyright law on a larger scale than any other organization in the western hemisphere; primarily by importing illegal and unsafe counterfeit goods into the US”.I have no idea why the courts have gone along with this scheme. My guess is that it’s corruption. reply zx8080 10 hours agorootparentprev> my question is why hasn&#x27;t the FBI seized every Amazon warehouse for knowingly selling counterfeit goods?What government would kill the goose that lays golden eggs?

Is it the FBI that is typically doing this, or CBP? reply gumballindie 12 hours agorootparentprevCorruption. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve wondered why it&#x27;s allowed as well. I assume via salami-slicing&#x2F;frog-boiling. We let it get worse little by little because everyone was winning now it feels too big to police. reply newZWhoDis 9 hours agorootparentprevThe world makes a lot more sense when you realize the government is basically a gang. The majority of law enforcement&#x2F;military action falls into a few buckets:1) Farming the tax cattle (ex: speeding tickets)2) Tracking down and punishing “foxes in the hen house” who disrupt their tax cattle (ex: a murderer easily destroys $1M in taxes per tax cow killed, gotta stop that)3) Turf wars vs other gangs who would usurp their role as farmer reply Eisenstein 8 hours agorootparentThe world makes a lot more sense when you realize it is composed of people, no matter what you decide to label them on top of that. reply StressedDev 12 hours agorootparentprevProbably because seizing the entire warehouse is an awful and unjust idea.First, Amazon&#x27;s warehouse hold merchandise from other companies. Why should they be punished because Amazon or a different company is selling counterfeit goods.Second, do the retailers know they are selling counterfeit products? There is a huge difference between intentionally deceiving people and getting hoodwinked by thieves. For example, if Amazon&#x27;s employees decided to buy counterfeit and promote them, that would be wrong. However, what happens if an Amazon employee is tricked and thinks they are buying legitimate goods but are really buying fake goods. In the later case, Amazon is a victim of fraud and should not be punished.Finally, punishments should be proportional to the crime. If I cause $5 worth of damage, I should not pay a $10,000 fine. Note I have noticed a lot of online posters push for draconian punishments and that is not just or helpful. reply michaelt 11 hours agorootparent> Second, do the retailers know they are selling counterfeit products?Everyone selling 2tb thumb drives knows they&#x27;re selling counterfeit products, yes.They will of course strategically claim ignorance if confronted - a lie only the most naive would believe. reply kube-system 11 hours agorootparentTechnically speaking, those 2tb flash drives are fraudulent, but not counterfeit. (which generally refers to misrepresentation in brand origin)Also, the word \"knowingly\" requires the person taking action to have the knowledge in their head. Someone else knowing it isn&#x27;t enough to qualify.Amazon&#x27;s listings are not curated. Amazon knows nothing about fraudulent listings until later brought to their attention. These fake flash drives exist for short period of time until they are brought to Amazon&#x27;s attention, at which point, they are taken down. reply stefan_ 11 hours agorootparentprevThey control the listings, they receive and hold the merchandise, they ship it, they deliver it, they take payment, they handle customer complaints, ...What&#x27;s the point where we are going to say \"it&#x27;s not good enough to point at the 3rd party with the autogenerated name\" and \"computers at large\"? reply neilv 8 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0CMBX671V&#x2F;I wonder whether they used Samsung&#x27;s factory tooling for that. reply macNchz 8 hours agoparentprevFirst one I clicked into, Amazon’s own AI generated review summary says “…it takes days to transfer anything, and has only 64 GB of usable space. Customers also dislike the data.”People in my world goggle at me when I say I don’t shop on Amazon, but whenever I do go on there I couldn’t be happier not to be paying for the privilege of combing through all of that garbage. (Amazon Visa rewards card holder since 2007 and had Prime 2010-2019) reply malfist 13 hours agoparentprevAmazon makes money from those garbage companies having an ad war over who gets to deceive the eyeballs of Amazon&#x27;s customers first, and then takes a cut when it gets sold.Customer Obsession and Earns Trust might be two of Amazon&#x27;s Leadership Principles, but no principles stand in the way of cold hard cash. reply StressedDev 11 hours agorootparentI agree with you about Amazon&#x27;s leadership principals. It&#x27;s clear that the retail side of Amazon regularly ignores them.My favorite example of this was I was browsing the \"top 50\" computer science books on Amazon. This was about 10 years ago. In the top 50, they had basic how to books (like how to use Linux or Excel), books on getting coding jobs, etc. They had almost no actual computer science books and yet, the top 50 list software almost certainly created by people with a computer science degrees!! The list even listed the same title more than once in a few cases. It was obvious that the software which built the list was broken and either had not been tested or was deployed in a known broken state. Customer obsession does not mean shipping obviously broken software which does not help the customer.As for trust, when I canceled Prime, Amazon used dark patterns to make the process as painful as possible. Not much to say other than I do not trust companies which try to trick me into not canceling a subscription I do not want. reply Eisenstein 8 hours agorootparentHonest question: why would you trust any public company? Do they have any motive to do anything in your interest that isn&#x27;t somehow calculated to benefit them monetarily in the maximum way possible? reply LaundroMat 12 hours agorootparentprevMy dad used to say principles are like farts. You can only hold them for so long. reply kube-system 13 hours agoparentprevEven more funny that they&#x27;re called \"thumb drives\" when that is a brand name. reply BEEdwards 12 hours agorootparentThat cat is out of the bag, that term has gone napkin or bandaid. reply kube-system 12 hours agorootparentYeah, Trek2000 didn&#x27;t really defend their mark too much. I suppose J&J probably does because I don&#x27;t see anyone using Bandaid for non-J&J bandages, at least in the US. reply BEEdwards 11 hours agorootparentNot for sales purposes, but I don&#x27;t know what brand the bandaids I have in the cabinet are, but if i ask for one that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll call them... reply kube-system 11 hours agorootparentSure.
