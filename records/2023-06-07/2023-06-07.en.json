A widespread protest is planned for June 12, with hundreds of subreddits planning to go dark for 48 hours.Reddit started life as a geeky site, but as it has aged, it has been trying to work more like a traditional social network. Part of that push included the development of a first-party app for mobile devices, but the 17-year-old site only launched an official app in 2016. Before then, it was up to third-party apps to pick up the slack, and even now, the revenue-focused official app is generally considered inferior to third-party options.Reasonable API pricing would not necessarily mean the death of third-party apps, but the pricing Reddit communicated to some of its biggest developers is far above what other sites charge. The popular iOS client Apollo announced it was facing a $20 million-a-year bill. Apollo's developer, Christian Selig, hasn't announced a shutdown but admitted, \"I don't have that kind of money or would even know how to charge it to a credit card.\"Other third-party apps are in the same boat. The developer of Reddit is Fun has said the API costs will \"likely kill\" the app. Narwhal, another third-party app, will be \"dead in 30 days\" when the pricing kicks in on July 1, according to its developer.Selig broke the news of the new pricing scheme, saying, \"I don't see how this pricing is anything based in reality or remotely reasonable.\" Selig said Reddit wants to charge $12,000 for 50 million requests, while Imgur, an image-focused site that's similar to Reddit, charges $166 for 50 million API calls. A post pinned to the top of the new /r/Save3rdPartyApps subreddit calls for a pricing decrease \"by a factor of 15 to 20,\" saying that would \"put API calls in territory more closely comparable to other sites, like Imgur.\"Reddit is Fun (RIF) developer /u/talklittle said Reddit's API terms also require \"blocking ads in third-party apps, which make up the majority of RIF's revenue.\" Talklittle says the pricing and ad restriction will \"force a paid subscription model\" onto any surviving apps. Reddit's APIs also exclude adult content, a major draw for the site.While Reddit is a company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the content moderation and community building is all done by volunteer moderators. This means that you get fun civil wars, where the users and mods can take up arms against the site administrators. The full list of subreddits participating in the June 12 shutdown is currently over a thousand subreddits strong. Many of the site's most popular subreddits, like r/gaming, r/Music, and r/Pics, are participating, and each has over 30 million subscribers. The Reddit administrators have yet to respond.Advance Publications, which owns Ars Technica parent Cond\u00e9 Nast, is the largest shareholder in Reddit.READER COMMENTS118WITHRON AMADEORon is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

    "hn_content": "Reddit is closing in on its IPO, and as part of trying to generate user growth, it is accused of artificially boosting engagement on localized versions of popular subreddits by creating poor-quality translated posts and asking moderators of localized subreddits to signal-boost them. Critics say the move is in line with the company's strategy to steer users towards the official app and gain tighter control. Further, analysts are raising concerns about the ethics of faking activity and thereby inflating user numbers to pump perceived value ahead of going public. Critics warned that such an approach could cause legal consequences if auditors do not pick up the fake data. Despite all this, Reddit is still hiring for international expansion.Reddit users suggest implementing a funding model similar to that of Discord and Twitch. Users would pay a small fee to upgrade their subscription to a subreddit, which would include access to special emojis for that sub, a special flair or re-colored username, and no ads on the upgraded sub. A portion of the money earned could go towards funding moderation for the sub, and Reddit could keep the rest. Concerns are raised about the implications of financial incentives on volunteer moderators. Users also discuss the use of Reddit data by Language Learning Models and the debate surrounding scraping Reddit content.Reddit users discuss the platform's history of creating fake users and generating content to make the site seem busy. They speculate on the ethics of Reddit using fake users to propel itself toward an IPO, with some arguing that it may be considered fraudulent behavior. Users also criticize Reddit's clunky app and speculate on why the company doesn't simply purchase a better app. Others express frustration with the shift from the mobile website to the app and speculate that it is a move to force users to download the app. Some criticize Reddit's handling of moderators and suggest they should be paid for their labor. Overall, users express skepticism and criticism of Reddit's business practices.The post is a discussion on Reddit's mobile app and website, with users expressing frustration about features being removed, the poor user experience, and the lack of priority given to fixing issues. Some users suggest that Reddit's focus on ad revenue and pleasing ad agencies is coming at the expense of user experience and moderation. There is debate about the effectiveness of third-party moderation tools like RES and Automod, and some users express a desire for alternatives to the official Reddit app. The overall tone is critical of the company and its priorities, with users feeling ignored and disrespected.Reddit's new API pricing, which will disallow commercial use and limit requests to 60-100 per minute, has caused concern over the future of third-party apps and legitimate bot use. The pricing changes coincide with a broader trend of major platforms tamping down on API usage. Redditors discuss whether the move is an attempt by Reddit to edge out the competition, such as Twitter, or a LLM prevention tactic. They also debate the implications of NSFW content removal from the API, how moderators might be negatively impacted by the API changes, and potential censorship issues for platforms as more agents make use of language models. Some Redditors suggest that more transparency in how Reddit utilizes and secures its API could help assuage concerns.- Reddit's API pricing plan is facing criticism for being too expensive, with some developers claiming it will kill third-party apps and hinder LLM training. \n- The pricing model has been accused of being retaliatory and to force people into using the official app.\n- Some users have suggested using scraping as an alternative to the API since the API is still usable without paying, and some projects have been scraping posts and comments for archival reasons for years.\n- There is speculation that Reddit's pricing plan was priced with specific customers in mind, but it's unclear who those customers are.\n- Some users believe that negative sentiment towards social media platforms rarely translates into user action, which is why platforms have never been able to control their narrative effectively.",

    "content": "Future of MoneyUS tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, BinanceBy Jonathan Stempel, Hannah Lang and John MccrankJune 6, 20239:29 PM PDTUpdated 4 min agoNEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a \"web of deception\".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.\"The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,\" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.\"If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.\"In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has \"demonstrated commitment to compliance.\"Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC \"looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,\" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, \"it seems like this is just the beginning.\"Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.\"The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,\" explained Oanda's Moya.BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWNSecurities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term \"security,\" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.[1/2] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo and representations of cryptocurrency are seen in this illustration taken June 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationSEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.\"The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,\" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.\"We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,\" she said.Reuters GraphicsFounded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's \"misguided and conscious refusal\" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.\"It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,\" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.\"These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.\"Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Hannah Lang and Michelle Price in Washington; Additional reporting by Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Leslie Adler and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Hannah LangThomson ReutersHannah Lang covers financial technology and cryptocurrency, including the businesses that drive the industry and policy developments that govern the sector.

    "hn_content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, claiming that it traded unregistered securities and sold other securities without meeting legal standards. This follows a similar lawsuit by the SEC against Binance. The issue at the center of these lawsuits is whether specific cryptocurrencies meet the definition of securities or are financial instruments. Bitcoin is among the primary examples of a cryptocurrency that does not fall under this definition, whereas certain stable coins and other negotiable financial instruments are considered securities. Coinbase is currently one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges and has been highly scrutinized by regulators due to the rapid growth of the industry.The post discusses the application of the Howey test to determine whether staking cryptocurrencies constitute securities. Some argue that staking is a service, while others argue it meets the criteria of a common enterprise with profits derived from the efforts of others. The SEC's stance is seen as unclear and arbitrary, potentially stifling innovation. The post also mentions that the SEC provides no guidance on what is or isn't a security, leaving companies without a clear path to legal compliance. Additionally, the post notes that some ICOs are almost certainly unregistered security offerings, and the $1 million threshold for investment in private companies is seen as too high.The current \"accredited investor\" test for net worth and income is considered racist, classist, sexist, and undemocratic by the author. The SEC Act of 1933 is no longer relevant to a world with millions of new tokens created in seconds. There is confusion around regulating some crypto instruments, including \"pure commodity coins\" like Bitcoin, which are not securities but are traded like securities due to speculation. Cryptocurrency has controversial use cases such as being a rebel medium or avoiding capital controls. However, it has failed to become adopted into any mainstream value chains and has not fulfilled early claims of becoming a transformative financial force. Coinbase may have prioritized short-term profit over building a healthy ecosystem in recent years.The debate revolves around whether Bitcoin is a commodity or a security, as commodities are regulated by the CFTC, while securities fall under the SEC. SEC Chair Gensler believes Bitcoin is a commodity, but everything else is a security. Trading something doesn\u2019t consume it, and trading a commodity doesn't consume it either, much like how a hamburger is only consumed when eaten. The majority of gold usage is in investment and central bank reserves. Bitcoin is consumed in the same way a central bank consumes gold. Cryptocurrency requiring nuanced legal treatment is not inherently by design, even if it was promoted as a feature by grifters and anarchists. Regulators clearly know exactly what is going on with cryptocurrencies. Certain cryptocurrency projects offering a reward for \"staking\" or similar are a security.The SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance for operating a platform that sold unregistered securities. Cryptocurrencies were discussed in this Hacker News thread, with participants debating whether or not they should be regulated as commodities, foreign currencies, securities, or none of the above. There was also discussion of the SEC's jurisdiction, the legal definitions of various financial terms, the limitations of the Howey Test in the context of cryptos, and whether or not the current regulation of cryptos is good or bad.The US SEC is suing Coinbase for offering unregistered securities and evading legal disclosure requirements since at least 2019. Coinbase Earn, the staking service providing APY yields, is being scrutinized for being an unregistered financial product. People buy crypto without real use for it and purely for speculative trading purposes. The law needs to differentiate between running a node on a crypto currency network, which generates commodities, and speculating on the price of crypto by creating a virtual token and selling that, which acts as a security. SEC's bounty program offers pretty good whistleblowing protection. Staking schemes have been collapsing over the last year, with Luna-backed Celsius being sued for running unregistered securities. Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Gemini, Kucoin, and others have been operating fine and profitable for years. The SEC is not protecting investors but uses this narrative as a vehicle for imposing regulations. TD Ameritrade, compared to Coinbase, has better regulatory audits and insurance protection rules.The SEC is suing Coinbase, claiming that the company commingled exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions and offered Coinbase Earn without registering the program as a security, depriving investors of critical protections. Coinbase has been seeking help from the SEC, but the SEC has been slow to come up with various legal requirements for the cryptocurrency industry. Companies like Celsius, FTX, and Voyager have disappeared and collapsed due to fraud, resulting in billions of American money being lost. There is a pattern of collapse among companies involved in \"staking\", which is looking to be the cause behind the crimes.\nA discussion on the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities and commodities by the SEC and CFTC. Bitcoin is the only coin classified as a commodity by both regulators. There is debate over whether ETH and other coins should be classified as securities. Confidentiality and lack of clarity from regulators has caused confusion in the industry. Arguments are made for both sides; some believe coins that can be used as a payment method are not securities while others point out that if a person buys a coin to make money, then it should be considered a security. The discussion highlights the need for more transparency and clarity from regulators.- Governments can easily shut down bank accounts but not cryptocurrency due to its decentralized nature.\n- Businesses and individuals may turn to cryptocurrency if they fear being blacklisted by payment processors over political or cultural reasons.\n- Crypto wallets have not been blacklisted for political or cultural reasons as 51% attacks are rare for large coins.\n- The primary advantage of crypto is permissionless electronic worldwide payment, with anonymity available through Monero.\n- Crypto may be used for illegal activity, but so can traditional banking and payment methods.\n- Cryptocurrency allows individuals to be their own banks, which can be practical for some.\n- Accepting crypto as a vendor can be challenging due to the lack of transactions and issues with processing and fees.\n- The main debate surrounding crypto in the US is whether they are securities regulated by the SEC or commodities regulated by the CFTC.",

Some pointed out how far the tech industry has come since the days of Computer Shopper.The Tech Times presents a series of comments on various tech hobbies from the 1990s, including scanning old computer magazines, using heat to debind books, and using beige boxes to get free calls. One comment notes how hobbyist computing was expensive given the limited versatility of early machines, while others recall the wonder of discovering new and innovative tech items in old computer magazines. Some recommend using a hair dryer or thermal binding machine to de-bind glued books, while others discuss the technical restrictions on scanning old books.Computer Shopper, a popular tech magazine in the 80s and 90s, is being digitized by an archivist, allowing young tech enthusiasts to experience the nostalgia of the early PC era. The magazine was famous for its thick, ad-filled pages, and enthusiasts spent hours poring over the back issues, dreaming of owning their dream machines while carefully balancing the cost of each component. The archivist has faced challenges with the cheap paper quality and faint mirror images on the other side of pages, but has managed to produce stunning digital copies of the magazine. Computer Shopper was particularly useful in guiding enthusiasts to complement formal studies. Its image-filled pages will be a valuable resource for future historians.Readers are discussing the value of digitizing historical computer magazines, specifically Computer Shopper, which contains valuable information on historical PC pricing and hardware availability. There is talk of using AI to correct scanned pages, but a large collection of debound pages would be needed to create a training set. The preservation of historical tech is appreciated and considered a passion project. The sudden surge of interest in this topic may be due to nostalgia for old technology and the desire to learn more about its history. The site hosting the digitized magazines experienced a high volume of traffic.",

    "content": "AboutCommunityContributeGitHubWikiBlogDonate/ Blog / OpenGL 3.1 on Asahi LinuxOpenGL 3.1 on Asahi LinuxPreviousUpgrade your Asahi Linux systems, because your graphics drivers are getting a big boost: leapfrogging from OpenGL 2.1 over OpenGL 3.0 up to OpenGL 3.1! Similarly, the OpenGL ES 2.0 support is bumping up to OpenGL ES 3.0. That means more playable games and more functioning applications.Back in December, I teased an early screenshot of SuperTuxKart\u2019s deferred renderer working on Asahi, using OpenGL ES 3.0 features like multiple render targets and instancing. Now you too can enjoy SuperTuxKart with advanced lighting the way it\u2019s meant to be:SuperTuxKart rendering with advanced lightAs before, these drivers are experimental and not yet conformant to the OpenGL or OpenGL ES specifications. For now, you\u2019ll need to run our -edge packages to opt-in to the work-in-progress drivers, understanding that there may be bugs. Please refer to our previous post explaining how to install the drivers and how to report bugs to help us improve.With that disclaimer out of the way, there\u2019s a LOT of new functionality packed into OpenGL 3.0, 3.1, and OpenGL ES 3.0 to make this release. Highlights include:Multiple render targetsMultisamplingTransform feedbackTexture buffer objects..and more.For now, let\u2019s talk about\u2026MultisamplingVulkan and OpenGL support multisampling, short for multisampled anti-aliasing. In graphics, aliasing causes jagged diagonal edges due to rendering at insufficient resolution. One solution to aliasing is rendering at higher resolutions and scaling down. Edges will be blurred, not jagged, which looks better. Multisampling is an efficient implementation of that idea.A multisampled image contains multiple samples for every pixel. After rendering, a multisampled image is resolved to a regular image with one sample per pixel, typically by averaging the samples within a pixel.Apple GPUs support multisampled images and framebuffers. There\u2019s quite a bit of typing to plumb the programmer\u2019s view of multisampling into the form understood by the hardware, but there\u2019s no fundamental incompatibility.The trouble comes with sample shading. Recall that in modern graphics, the colour of each fragment is determined by running a fragment shader given by the programmer. If the fragments are pixels, then each sample within that pixel gets the same colour. Running the fragment shader once per pixel still benefits from multisampling thanks to higher quality rasterization, but it\u2019s not as good as actually rendering at a higher resolution. If instead the fragments are samples, each sample gets a unique colour, equivalent to rendering at a higher resolution (supersampling). In Vulkan and OpenGL, fragment shaders generally run per-pixel, but with \u201csample shading\u201d, the application can force the fragment shader to run per-sample.How does sample shading work from the drivers\u2019 perspective? On a typical GPU, it is simple: the driver compiles a fragment shader that calculates the colour of a single sample, and sets a hardware bit to execute it per-sample instead of per-pixel. There is only one bit of state associated with sample shading. The hardware will execute the fragment shader multiple times per pixel, writing out pixel colours independently.Easy, right?Alas, Apple\u2019s \u201cAGX\u201d GPU is not typical.AGX always executes the shader once per pixel, not once per sample, like older GPUs that did not support sample shading. AGX does support it, though.How? The AGX instruction set allows pixel shaders to output different colours to each sample. The instruction used to output a colour1 takes a set of samples to modify, encoded as a bit mask. The default all-1\u2019s mask writes the same value to all samples in a pixel, but a mask setting a single bit will write only the single corresponding sample.This design is unusual, and it requires driver backflips to translate \u201cfragment shaders\u201d into hardware pixel shaders. How do we do it?Physically, the hardware executes our shader once per pixel. Logically, we\u2019re supposed to execute the application\u2019s fragment shader once per sample. If we know the number of samples per pixel, then we can wrap the application\u2019s shader in a loop over each sample. So, if the original fragment shader is:interpolated colour = interpolate at current sample(input colour);output current sample(interpolated colour);then we will transform the program to the pixel shader:for (sample = 0; sample < number of samples; ++sample) {  sample mask = (1 << sample);  interpolated colour = interpolate at sample(input colour, sample);  output samples(sample mask, interpolated colour);}The original fragment shader runs inside the loop, once per sample. Whenever it interpolates inputs at the current sample position, we change it to instead interpolate at a specific sample given by the loop counter sample. Likewise, when it outputs a colour for a sample, we change it to output the colour to the single sample given by the loop counter.If the story ended here, this mechanism would be silly. Adding sample masks to the instruction set is more complicated than a single bit to invoke the shader multiple times, as other GPUs do. Even Apple\u2019s own Metal driver has to implement this dance, because Metal has a similar approach to sample shading as OpenGL and Vulkan. With all this extra complexity, is there a benefit?If we generated that loop at the end, maybe not. But if we know at compile-time that sample shading is used, we can run our full optimizer on this sample loop. If there is an expression that is the same for all samples in a pixel, it can be hoisted out of the loop.2 Instead of calculating the same value multiple times, as other GPUs do, the value can be calculated just once and reused for each sample. Although it complicates the driver, this approach to sample shading isn\u2019t Apple cutting corners. If we slapped on the loop at the end and did no optimizations, the resulting code would be comparable to what other GPUs execute in hardware. There might be slight differences from spawning fewer threads but executing more control flow instructions3, but that\u2019s minor. Generating the loop early and running the optimizer enables better performance than possible on other GPUs.So is the mechanism only an optimization? Did Apple stumble on a better approach to sample shading that other GPUs should adopt? I wouldn\u2019t be so sure.Let\u2019s pull the curtain back. AGX has its roots as a mobile GPU intended for iPhones, with significant PowerVR heritage. Even if it powers Mac Pros today, the mobile legacy means AGX prefers software implementations of many features that desktop GPUs implement with dedicated hardware.Yes, I\u2019m talking about blending.Blending is an operation in graphics APIs to combine the fragment shader output colour with the existing colour in the framebuffer. It is usually used to implement alpha blending, to let the background poke through translucent objects.When multisampling is used without sample shading, although the fragment shader only runs once per pixel, blending happens per-sample. Even if the fragment shader outputs the same colour to each sample, if the framebuffer already had different colours in different samples, blending needs to happen per-sample to avoid losing that information already in the framebuffer.A traditional desktop GPU blends with dedicated hardware. In the mobile space, there\u2019s a mix of dedicated hardware and software. On AGX, blending is purely software. Rather than configure blending hardware, the driver must produce variants of the fragment shader that include instructions to implement the desired blend mode. With alpha blending, a fragment shader like:colour = calculate lighting();output(colour);becomes:colour = calculate lighting();dest = load destination colour;alpha = colour.alpha;blended = (alpha * colour) + ((1 - alpha) * dest));output(blended);Where\u2019s the problem?Blending happens per sample. Even if the application intends to run the fragment shader per pixel, the shader must run per sample for correct blending. Compared to other GPUs, this approach to blending would regress performance when blending and multisampling are enabled but sample shading is not.On the other hand, exposing multisample pixel shaders to the driver solves the problem neatly. If both the blending and the multisample state are known, we can first insert instructions for blending, and then wrap with the sample loop. The above program would then become:for (sample = 0; sample < number of samples; ++sample_id) {  colour = calculate lighting();  dest = load destination colour at sample (sample);  alpha = colour.alpha;  blended = (alpha * colour) + ((1 - alpha) * dest);  sample mask = (1 << sample);  output samples(sample_mask, blended);}In this form, the fragment shader is asymptotically worse than the application wanted: the fragment shader is executed inside the loop, running per-sample unnecessarily.Have no fear, the optimizer is here. Since colour is the same for each sample in the pixel, it does not depend on the sample ID. The compiler can move the entire original fragment shader (and related expressions) out of the per-sample loop:colour = calculate lighting();alpha = colour.alpha;inv_alpha = 1 - alpha;colour_alpha = alpha * colour;for (sample = 0; sample < number of samples; ++sample_id) {  dest = load destination colour at sample (sample);  blended = colour_alpha + (inv_alpha * dest);  sample mask = (1 << sample);  output samples(sample_mask, blended);}Now blending happens per sample but the application\u2019s fragment shader runs just once, matching the performance characteristics of traditional GPUs. Even better, all of this happens without any special work from the compiler. There\u2019s no magic multisampling optimization happening here: it\u2019s just a loop.By the way, what do we do if we don\u2019t know the blending and multisample state at compile-time? Hope is not lost\u2026\u2026but that\u2019s a story for another day.What\u2019s next?While OpenGL ES 3.0 is an improvement over ES 2.0, we\u2019re not done. In my work-in-progress branch, OpenGL ES 3.1 support is nearly finished, which will unlock compute shaders.The final goal is a Vulkan driver running modern games. We\u2019re a while away, but the baseline Vulkan 1.0 requirements parallel OpenGL ES 3.1, so our work translates to Vulkan. For example, the multisampling compiler passes described above are common code between the drivers. We\u2019ve tested them against OpenGL, and now they\u2019re ready to go for Vulkan.And yes, the team is already working on Vulkan.Until then, you\u2019re one pacman -Syu away from enjoying OpenGL 3.1!Store a formatted value to local memory acting as a tilebuffer. \u21a9\ufe0eVia common subexpression elimination if the loop is unrolled, otherwise via code motion. \u21a9\ufe0eSince the number of samples is constant, all threads branch in the same direction so the usual \u201cGPUs are bad at branching\u201d advice does not apply. \u21a9\ufe0eAlyssa Rosenzweig \u00b7 2023-06-06Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0Linux\u00ae is the registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.

    "hn_content": "Asahi Linux has released an update that includes various features such as the cpuidle driver, CPU boost states, thermal throttling, touchpad bug fixes, and base support for the M2 Pro/Max/Ultra SoCs. The update also introduced a new firmware-based battery charge control method that limits the charging to 75%/80% to prevent over-stressing the battery and extend the battery life. The new Asahi feature is not rare amongst modern laptops, but it requires explicit driver and OS support. This feature is available on macOS as well, and the implementation varies across different devices. Users can manually control the max charge percentage with the AlDente utility for macOS and permanently set it to 80%. Apple may also provide support to Asahi Linux in terms of donating a small dev team for a few months.The Asahi Linux team is preparing for test results on the M2 Ultra, possibly from users, and is soliciting donations. Asahi Linux allows users to run Linux on Apple hardware, and users are grateful for the freedom to do so. Some debate exists over the sustainability of Asahi, given Apple's incentive to cater to their software ecosystem rather than supporting Linux, but the team's efforts in fixing Arm issues in the Linux kernel may benefit everyone. Reverse engineering and writing software for hardware that designers hadn't planned for is satisfying and fun for some software engineers, and competition in the market improves options and prices for everyone. While unsupported hardware and dissatisfaction with it differ between individual users and situations, Linux is generally stable and performant, offering an alternative to proprietary drivers.Asahi Linux team is fixing bugs related to non-4k page size architectures, specific to Arm systems. Other non-x86 architectures are seeing improvements too. Apple doesn't need to contribute to the Linux kernel to make this work good. Asahi Linux allows users of Apple hardware to run Linux on it. Most hardware manufacturers are terrible at writing software, leading to issues. Hardware vendors could help by providing documentation instead of drivers. AMD Linux laptop can be a good alternative to Apple hardware. Expectations of distros can be shockingly low, and volunteer pools are small.The post discusses the use of Asahi Linux on Mac hardware and suggests alternatives to using Mac laptops in the future. Some readers debate the benefits and drawbacks of using different laptop models and discuss their personal experiences with different operating systems. The post largely focuses on the compatibility of different hardware with Linux and the varying use cases for different laptops. There is some discussion of the question of whether or not it is worth it to buy a Mac just to run Asahi Linux.Asahi Linux, a community-led project to bring Linux to Apple M1 devices, has made significant progress in recent months. The latest update, version 0.4, now supports USB Ethernet adapters and has improved Wi-Fi connectivity, among other changes. Asahi Linux developers have also released a guide on building Linuxkit, which allows for booting custom Linux images. Despite progress, there are still some limitations, such as the absence of GPU drivers for Linux on Apple silicon. Other threads suggest that hardware support for Asahi Linux is not quite complete and more work is needed to reach feature parity with macOS. However, some users are impressed by the value proposition of Apple Silicon and find it challenging to go back to traditional laptops.Apple, some argue that the company is hostile towards developers and hackers. However, Asahi Linux developers state that Apple is not putting up roadblocks and is going out of its way to leave things open for them. While the hackability of Apple products is irrelevant as Apple targets a different market and only favors hardware support and lifetime support (in terms of repairs and updates), some believe that the company's hardware is overpriced while others argue that its hardware and software are worth it, pointing out that there is no laptop on the market that is close to an M1 Air in terms of performance. However, others suggest that Apple's hardware could be made more accessible by providing access to the tools to pair parts and adopting a more hacker-friendly approach.Asahi Linux team has released a significant update, improving CPU power management, which makes it similar to MacOS. The power per watt and absolute performance of Asahi Linux is already better than high-end x86 laptops, and it will probably beat MacOS in many practical scenarios. As for running games, the addition of Vulkan to Asahi Linux will be more effective for Mac gaming than Apple's DirectX 12 translation layer. However, despite the progress made, some incompatibilities exist with Asahi Linux and GPU drivers, which can impact performance, specifically for people running one kind of ML workload. Apple does not officially support running another operating system, such as Asahi Linux, due to support concerns; therefore, it is unofficially helping Asahi Linux to run on its hardware. To date, the Asahi team has worked with M1 and has not yet done an M2 Ultra.The post discusses Asahi Linux, a port of Linux for ARM-based Macs. Users discuss the benefits of running Linux on Apple hardware, such as superior battery life, performance, and hardware quality. Some users argue that Linux laptops with comparable hardware are hard to come by, and that Linux enthusiasts enjoy the challenge of supporting non-Linux-friendly hardware. Proton is discussed as a way to run Windows games on Linux, and FEX as a way to run x86-64 code on ARM.- No Vulkan drivers currently available for improving the Vulkan driver, which needs to be developed first.\n- Developers have been using Linux VMs on Macs for years, providing flexibility and speed when running intensive programs like Docker.\n- Challenges with file sharing and compatibility with Mac OS can arise when using a Linux VM, but workarounds exist.\n- Alternative virtual machines like UTM and Parallels are available to use with Linux development, but may have performance issues.\n- Docker desktop has arm64 builds available for use on Macs.",

The report also recommends against certain practices, including declawing, live boiling without stunning, and live sale of decapod crustaceans to untrained handlers. The criteria for sentience may also apply to other species, such as certain predatory fish and social wasps. The report provides a useful framework for evaluating animal welfare and best practices for transport, stunning, and slaughter. The new classification aims to improve animal welfare, particularly for invertebrates, similar to the classification of vertebrates under animal welfare law. The report also raises concerns about fishing practices, ocean pollution, and warming oceans affecting the populations of sentient beings. Taking these concerns into account and reducing the suffering of animals in general is essential, even if not all issues can be addressed simultaneously.The UK has introduced a landmark environmental measure, which includes recognizing that decapod crustaceans, such as lobsters and crabs, and cephalopods, such as octopuses, can experience pain, distress, fear, or harm. The new law lays down the necessary groundwork to enforce positive change toward animal welfare. This is the latest development in animal welfare law, with vertebrate animals already recognized as sentient beings. The new legislation could lead to protecting species being depleted by global warming and over-fishing. It is a step towards animal welfare, and activists hope it will lead to other proposals, such as banning bottom-trawling, addressing bycatch laws, pollution, and eventually, animal farming. Scientists and chefs question the impact of the new rules, including banning live crustaceans for consumption, and whether it will lead to better meat industry practices.The UK government has extended animal welfare protections to crustaceans and molluscs for the first time, acknowledging that they are capable of experiencing pain. The announcement has been met with debate, with some arguing that all animals are sentient and thus deserve protection from harm, while others ask whether any animals should be afforded rights at all or whether legal protection will extend to all animals in due course. The new law suggests that lobsters and other popular seafood delicacies should be killed in specific ways and prevents \"eyestalk ablation\" or declawing. A committee will be set up to assist lawmakers in ensuring that animal welfare and protection are considered when developing new laws.The discussion centers around the ethics of animal testing and the treatment of animals in general. Some argue that animal testing is necessary for scientific progress while others argue that it is cruel and unnecessary. The debate raises questions about our moral obligations towards animals and the environment. Some commenters point out that humans are not the only ones who kill animals in nature and that it is a part of life. The discussion also touches on the issue of animal welfare in meat production and consumption. Some argue that it is important to source ethical meat, while others see it as a matter of personal choice. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity of ethical considerations surrounding animal treatment and scientific progress.The discussion revolves around the morality of humans killing and eating animals for sport or taste. While some argue that humans have a moral obligation to treat animals better, others compare the situation to nature, where survival requires preying on other animals. The discussion also touches on the intelligence and the suffering of animals and how humans should reflect on it. The comments often compare nature and human behavior and the standards humans should adhere to. The discussion also touches on veganism, its ethical background, and its efficacy. The comments also include sarcasm and jokes, with one commenter stating that the title made them hungry and another referencing a science-fiction book.The article discusses the debate around the sentience of crabs, lobsters, and octopuses. A review found that there is evidence to support their sentience, and therefore, better welfare practices should be implemented to reduce their suffering. The review recommends against declawing, eye stalk ablation, and extreme slaughter methods. The conversation in the comment section includes speculation about the possibility of a future encounter with more intelligent beings that may not be kind to humans. There is also a discussion about the definition of sentience and if it applies to animals like plants. Some suggest it is impossible to ditch incrementalism and put an end to all animal slaughter, while others suggest solutions like synthesizing anything that living things produce.The comments discuss different ethical and ecological considerations related to food consumption. The topic of plant-based diets is brought up, specifically the idea of fruitarianism and the potential problems associated with it. The discussion also delves into the moral implications of eating meat and animal products, and how it relates to wild animal consumption. The commenters express a desire for responsible and sustainable food production, both for plant and animal-based products. There is a lot of questioning of the ethics behind food consumption, and the complexity of the issues is acknowledged.",

Today, sadly the reddit account through which, I moderated a lot of subs and spent time on, comes to an end. The reason was because I spammed according to reddit, but the reality is that they have censored me because I was hurting Reddit.Asking multiple third-party app devs consider Lemmy + Made the same post here as wellI never thought this would happen, not that I didn\u2019t completely expect it (but maybe not this soon and sudden), after all Reddit is known for censorship, and the fact that Reddit admins have absolute power over this website makes this believable. But part of me, misses that reddit account, it has been special to me, as I\u2019ve spent countless of hours spending my personal time to moderate and improve communities that helped Reddit thrive. I moderated as many subs as over 25, many of them had atleast over 1k people, some as many as 200k if not more.Before this happened, suspiciously, they banned r/LemmyMigration today early morning,it remained banned for a few hours and returned back to normal (not weird at all). I thought that was a mistake, as the sub was back to normal unbanned, but it seems like the Reddit admins realized if they banned my sub, that would prove how they censor it, it can work against them. Now, it seems like they have realized that bringing my account down would be more effective, and stop me from possibly sharing how they censored my sub on other subs for example.It\u2019s a shame, and part of me is sad, everything I worked hard for was taken away by them all of a sudden. I wanted to bring some of my communities here, now everything is gone, and it feels more like starting from scratch (Or discuss with mods I am still in contact with, and get help to bring communities I was planning on bring here, but it certainly makes things harder, not giving up anyways, especially not after this).BTW I have filled an appeal, but I don\u2019t expect this to be reversed, this was planned by the Reddit admins and all they have to do is ignore my appeal, there is nothing more I can do to get my account back, and they just got rid of someone who was pinpointing some of their biggest flaws and potentially dangering their platform\u2019s dominance in the \u201caggregation and discussion platforms\u201d market.A note to all refugees and ex-redditors here, or those who are planning to join Lemmy - See the power a centralized corporation like Reddit holds. With a decentralized alternative like Lemmy, you can host your own instance or join another one if you get censored, with lemmy, we can put more power back in the hands of the people.I don\u2019t have much else to say, moving on I will have to work with mods left that I do know through external platforms like Discord and try to bring some communities here. I hope this does not happen to any other moderator who have spend countless of hours helping Reddit in-directly like I did, somehow escaping such a suspension.EDIT: There is some controversy in the comments if I actually spammed, I don\u2019t think I spammed at all, I only made a post on r/ApolloApp, it became a hit so I cross-posted it to other third-party app subs, just so that it can hopefully reach out to the respective developers for them to possibly consider Lemmy in the wake of new reddit API changes.I was also certainly not the only one mentioning alternatives like Lemmy on the r/Apolloapp or any other third-party app sub, in-fact many people were mentioning alternatives, though I was banned, also my community r/LemmyMigration as mentioned above was called spam (and was temporarily banned, but was weirdly brought back up just to put my account down later today afternoon) when it only had 2 posts today morning. To me, \u201cspam\u201d seems like it is only used as a cover up by Reddit, the real reason is that my posts, just like r/LemmyMigration, was about Lemmy, a competition to Reddit.Also if it was really spam, as soon as I cross-posted my post from r/apolloapp to the other subs, the mods would have removed it well before they got a lot of attention, why didn\u2019t they?EDIT 2: A user called @danke has been spreading misinformation about me in the comments:Just as you did on your newly created reddit alt, you\u2019re painting this lie that you were banned for your tiny no-name subreddit and not for spamming this garbage on 11 different mobile app subreddits in quick succession. It\u2019s truly like clockwork for sitebanned users to lie and omit these massive details.This is a blatant lie, I mentioned about the cross-posts right IN THIS post: \u201cAsking multiple third-party app devs consider Lemmy + Made the same post here as well\u201dAs you can see, I made the post right here and on reddit, i never missed any details.You must log in or register to comment.HotTopNewOldChat@Boobajoob6\u20221hThat sucks dude.

Argentina subreddit was a perfect example.@MetalHead770\u20224hThat\u2019s why I\u2019m done with reddit. The blatant censorship and leftist circle jerking was enough to drive me away.borari5\u20222hleftist circle jerkingYou are aware of where you ended up right?@MetalHead771\u20222hSo Lemmy is going to be more of the same?borari6\u20222hThere\u2019s a pretty strong contingent of Marxists, Leninists, and left-leaning people in the federated lemmy network, yes. I like it a lot more than Reddit and their coddling of the actually dangerous to society as a whole far-right, built I just found it ironic you came to lemmy to get away from the left lol.@MetalHead771\u20222hI left reddit because of the blatant censorship against anything that is right leaning. I\u2019ve had comments removed that were just remotely supporting a conservative position and been attacked by others for the same. If it\u2019s going to be the same here, then I probably won\u2019t subscribe to political communities.@redditrefugee@lemmy.one13\u202210hReddit permanently suspended all of my accounts because I said Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a cunt for not retiring when she had the chance. R/politics banned that account, and then a few weeks later I\u2019d forgotten about that incident and commented in another post from a different account. That\u2019s when reddit permabanned all of my accounts.I\u2019ve been on reddit since August 2008 when Randal Monroe published this xkcd about it: https://xkcd.com/477/Bonus link: https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/71v7z/typewriter_xkcd/15 fucking years on that site and they ban all my accounts and devices, then third party apps, porn, and who knows what else. Good riddance.nackmack6\u20229h@redditrefugee @Archit bit of a rude word to call her, especially in the US if you\u2019re not from here and your culture is a lot more relaxed on that word. So while it\u2019s gross that they\u2019ve banned you I\u2019m kind of not surprised that kind of language would attract that kind of attention.@MetalHead770\u20224hExcept the mods on Reddit don\u2019t mind at all if you insult conservatives or Republicans with much worse rhetoric. In fact. they encourage it.Egypt Urnash4\u202210hhahaha holy shitI wonder if \u201ccross-posting about /r/LemmyMigration to a bunch of other subs\u201d triggered an automatic spam filter in a way that a bunch of different people saying \u201chey have you heard about Lemmy\u201d does not. There\u2019s a certain level of slack I\u2019m willing to cut for people trying to moderate something as huge as Reddit or Twitter or whatever; it\u2019s what happens in the next few days that\u2019s really going to be worth reacting to.Good luck with the appeal. <3TheArstaInventorcreator2\u20225hYeah, my appeal has been nothing but ignored, as if it never existed, not even a single reply from them backing their decision.@smartwater0897@lemmy.one3\u202210hWhy would you work for free to help reddit, when you know what they are? Is it because you still have hope the site will go back to how it was when you started?TheArstaInventorcreator2\u20225hI stopped when I realized and started supporting FOSS projects like Lemmy, in-fact that\u2019s why I posted about Lemmy, and in-turn got banned for mentioning reddit\u2019s competitor, and most probably making reddit admins feel in-secure.I kind of gave away everything I did at Reddit for Lemmy, and somehow it was something I was expecting might happen, I was willing to take the risk anyways, this proves the disadvantages of relying on a platform like Reddit.@LoweyEnglish8\u202214hSo, this might or might not provoke the Streisand effect? At either case it\u2019s important to post links to your alternative accounts on different platforms on your bio and put it in archive.org + archive.today for ban reasons. Anyone on any platform can get banned, it\u2019s important to have a plan for that. Hope you can recover at least partial/full of what was banned.@wiki_me18\u202217hIf this is true, this is probably an anti competitive practice and you can report it to regulation authorities in the US and EU, you might want to consult some non profit that deals with open source and free software for legal advice.@JshKlsn18\u202215hyou can report it to regulation authorities in the USFunny you think the US cares.@Jumuta10\u202214hLouis Rossmann\u2019s lobbying videos have made me lose all of my trust in the integrity of the US government tbh@semperpeppe@sopuli.xyz3\u202214hWe can try to send an email to FSFE and though them we may be able to reach some more visibility. Also, there is a large list of journalists that already use and support the Fediverse, some of them write for big newspapers. Another thing could be directly contacting your MPs, but the communication in that case is different I guess@neytjs60\u20221dThis is another good reason to stop using reddit. The internet used to have millions of active message boards for discussion of numerous topics. Reddit has essentially become one giant message board to rule them all. The world does not need this. Best to help decentralize the internet by promoting alternatives.@Lowey12\u202214hOne of the reason reddit rose from these boards was persistence, boards were all over the place and no sureness if they will stay tomorrow. It seems reddit posts now have the same fate.@abraxas1\u202210hDelphi was pretty good. But it was also fairly persistent.@RagingNerdoholic20\u202217h\u201cSpam\u201d reeks of weak horseshit justification for reddit\u2019s actions here. Lots of people x-post all sorts of things all the time. They were itching for a legitimate-sounding reason to ban you and they just reached for the first thing they could find using the loosest possible definition.@JshKlsn16\u202215hIt is. Have you seen any of those onlyfans girls Reddit accounts? They post the same photo over 100x per day to all different subs. If you scroll down their profile, you can scroll for a good solid 5 minutes before you reach 7 days ago.This isn\u2019t about spam. Spam gets caught in filters. Spammers get shadow banned.@RagingNerdoholic5\u202211hThat explicitly violates the spamming and self promotion rules.Meanwhile, reddit admins:___@crankylinuxuser@sopuli.xyz9\u202210hIn reality, its whatever causes Reddit to look worse for their upcoming IPO.And the real issue here is that this lying and deception is at the root of Reddit\u2019s core values.https://venturebeat.com/social/reddit-fake-users/\" (Cofounder) Huffman said one other strategy proved crucial to Reddit\u2019s early success, which most people are unaware of: The team submitted a ridiculous amount of content under fake user accounts to give the appearance of popularity. Yes, you read that right. Reddit \u2014 a site that values a fair and open democratic process to determine worthy content and police itself \u2014 sleeps soundly on a bed of lies. \"@pitninja3\u20228hLol thank you for that article. I never knew reddit started out by astroturfing their own site. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d probably stopped doing that by the time I joined, but with that, various leadership/admin scandals in the time since, and now gaslighting third party app devs/users, I\u2019m pretty much done with their shit. I might browse communities that haven\u2019t gone another direction yet, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to contribute anything over there anymore.@crankylinuxuser@sopuli.xyz2\u20227hYeah I had all my accounts permabanned last week myself, including a porn account, 2 camped accounts, and a 10y old occult account. All gone. They also shadowban all from my previous IP.I also had a rather public blowout as well previously, about very similar issues. All it takes is a few dozen people to report you and permaban city here you come. And no, you\u2019re not told why either.Im done with feeding anything to reddit: including content, comments, or even basic usage/telemetry. I can surf reddiv via cached data via archive.org or google cache.(and yes, I could defeat their IP and invasive browser/OS identification. No, I hope they die. edit: they as in reddit, not individuals)@WD4016\u20221dThis is unsurprising, sadly. Reddit\u2019s moderation is a joke, and they\u2019re very well known for putting down oppositional posts and users.

    "hn_content": "Reddit has banned the account of a user who spoke in favor of migration to privacy-centric social media platform Lemmy, which seeks to offer a decentralized version of Reddit. However,\u00a0Hacker News did manage\u00a0to catch hold of the discussion, where users argued about the benefits and drawbacks of a federated and server-maintained social media platform that will compete with established sites like Reddit. Critics argue that the modest technical skills necessary to use these alternative platforms are a bug rather than a feature, while others argue that these platforms help make the conversations more interesting due to the community\u2019s focus on quality over quantity. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether such sites will become more than niche alternatives to established sites that require less investment and effort on the part of the end user.A new platform called Sift aims to offer a more tag-based curation system and a reputation graph to solve the \"eternal September problem\" and provide trustworthy, relevant content. Reddit users discuss the problems with Reddit, including censorship, forced advertising, and content filtration. Some suggest Mastodon as an alternative but criticize its difficulty to use and lack of moderation. Others argue that popularity in itself is no problem for any platform, as long as it manages to scale up moderation with growth. The discussion includes various technical issues with Mastodon, such as being slow and a lack of clear democratic moderation. Finally, many participants concede that replacing Reddit completely with a new platform may not be possible, as the bad stuff is baked into the underlying 'profit-driven' entity.Reddit is favoring the center over the edge, with decision-making to favor vanilla buyers. Twitch has introduced new branding and advertisement rules banning independent ads run by creators. Reddit is facing challenges with its website and app functionality, leading to calls for a Reddit alternative like Lemmy. Smaller online communities have a healthier signal-to-noise ratio and are more desirable for many users. A hybrid of a wiki, chatroom, and forum could be a better platform for some content types than existing options. Many people are turning away from social media and internet communities due to time-wasting and addiction.Tech savvy users are discussing the possibility of migrating to Reddit alternatives like Lemmy, but there are concerns with the moderation and content. Reddit has faced criticism for banning users who suggest alternative platforms, such as rdrama.net. Users have also reported issues with the slow and buggy redesign of Reddit's website and app, prompting them to use third-party clients or the old Reddit version. There are doubts about whether Lemmy can handle a sudden influx of millions of new users, and some suggest that a centralized approach to a competitor would be more successful. However, some users believe that competition is necessary in the free market to prevent corporations from exploiting customers.Users on Reddit are discussing the limitations and scalability issues of Lemmy, a federated open-source alternative to Reddit. Some users argue that the infrastructure is not scalable enough to handle spikes in traffic, while others defend the architecture of the platform and suggest sharding the database for better performance. Others point out the importance of federated platforms as an alternative to centralized social media and criticize Reddit's actions in banning users who advocate for alternative communication. A user discusses Aaron Swartz's legacy and how projects like Lemmy carry on his spirit. Some users also discuss issues with Reddit's moderation practices and its commercialization.Users of Reddit may have to migrate to other platforms due to recent bans and censorship. One such alternative is the federated forum, Lemmy, which uses the W3C ActivityPub standard for federation. While some users are concerned about Lemmy's association with crypto scams and communism, its scalability and interchangeability of instances make it a suitable alternative for those looking to avoid centralized control. However, some critics point out that the performance of the software, particularly under heavy traffic, may be an issue. Despite its potential as an alternative forum, there is no power balance between consumers and suppliers in a capitalistic system, making it difficult for consumers to resist the drop in use-value in the face of profit maximization.There is a discussion on Reddit alternatives and the flaws of Reddit. Some users recommend Lemmy and Tildes as working with Apollo or RiF. However, Lemmy needs improvement as some users face issues with the community creation. Gab is mentioned as a Reddit alternative with free speech, but it is controversial due to the promotion of hate speech. The discussion also includes standards as a means for individuals to get rich and for preventing mass users' suffering from those with capital. There is concern that Elon Musk's influence on tech CEOs is worrying as he has expressed his belief that SWEs are pampered and need to be knocked down a few pegs.",

    "content": "Apple has announced the release of their new mixed reality headset, called Apple Vision, with a planned ship date of early 2024 at a price of $3,499. Users who have experienced the device describe it as an extraordinary experience, with high-quality hardware, and a larger potential than anticipated. Apple Vision is technically a VR device experientially, however is an AR device. It uses some of its 12 cameras to capture the world and displays it to the screens in front of the user's eyes, achieving a time delay of less than 12 milliseconds. Apple's operating system, labelled visionOS, is designed from the ground up for spatial computing, with a real-time execution engine. The future of the product may not yet be clear, but the device's development is testament to Apple's ability to integrate hardware and software.The Apple Vision Pro has the potential to be a game-changing device, especially for productivity and work, due to its easy justification of costs and ability to create a large workspace for users on the go. It also poses a threat to the iPad as an ultimate consumption device, with its impressive video experiences, while the iPhone remains unparalleled in computing. However, the Vision Pro is faced with a chicken-and-egg problem when it comes to producing content that delivers its immersive experience. Additionally, the experience may not be conducive to social connections, as it is a solitary experience, leading to a potential increase in loneliness. The Vision Pro is a slow burn device that may need time to replace existing product categories in the market.",

    "hn_content": "Apple has launched a new virtual and augmented reality headset, called Apple Vision. The device uses AR and VR, and re-creates AR within the VR world. The headset includes 12 cameras, LIDAR, and has a lot of processing power. The potential use cases for the headset includes sharing live experiences with others, new gaming experiences, and hand gesture recognition control. The device has received positive reviews for its hardware and software, and some view it as better than anything else on the market. Some critics are skeptical about the adoption of the device and are worried about the impact on loneliness.Apple has combined AR and VR with its new Vision headset. However, users have criticized the Quest Pro, which does the same thing, but poorly. The Quest 2 also has subpar resolution IR or monochrome cameras and can only be used for short periods. There is a push to develop applications for Vision that can replace laptops and increase productivity by allowing a portable virtual office. Potential use cases for Vision include training/education, streaming, decorating, and escape/relaxation. The power of the headset could lead to the creation of GPT chatbots in simulated realities. The current price of $3,500 is prohibitive for consumers.Apple's new VR headset, the \"Vision Pro,\" is garnering excitement among tech enthusiasts who are anticipating the device's potential for propulsion in the field of work productivity and entertainment. The headset boasts a built-in keyboard, and voice activation capabilities and has a 5K ultra-wide display. The chipset and technology used in the Vision Pro received requests from other streaming video companies to integrate them into their systems, but Apple denied those requests, saying it will remain proprietary. The headset's cost seems to be Apple's current worry, as it will likely be priced higher than any current VR headset on the market. The Vision Pro is set to be released in 2022.Apple's new VR headset, the Apple Vision Pro, is priced at $3,500 which is considered exorbitant by many. However, some argue that people are willing to pay such prices for MacBook Airs and non-pro iPhones. The company may plan to release a non-pro version later, and adding \"Pro\" to the product's name gives a psychological effect that justifies its high price. The \"eye passthrough\" display is a unique feature that could be trimmed to reduce the cost, but it is unclear whether the display on the front of the Vision Pro that shows the user's eyes will be present in the non-pro version. Apple may release a more affordable consumer version later, with predictions ranging from next year to a few years down the road. Several suggestions have been made for a naming convention for the non-pro version, including Vision Air or Vision Classic.Comments on an HN thread discussing the release of Apple's AR/VR headset reveal mixed opinions on its potential use cases, with some dismissing it as a dystopian technology, and others excited about the possibilities for entertainment and healthcare. Some commenters also express concerns about privacy and the use of the technology for recording personal events. There are also discussions about the history of porn's role in driving cutting-edge technology and the potential for the headset to be used in this industry. One commenter notes the evolution of mirrorless cameras and the advantages of mirrorless technology over traditional reflex mirrors.Porn drives consumer adoption of new technology because it enhances the product's appeal to a wider audience. The significance of porn in driving technological innovation can be seen in older technologies like VHS, which won out because of porn, but it's hard to substantiate because of the absence of concrete evidence. It's suggested that porn and gaming drive new tech forward, so a VR/AR device fully focused on those use cases could be good for pushing the tech forward; this is not likely to happen with Apple's new VR headset. There are concerns about privacy and whether porn will be allowed on the device, but it doesn't matter because videos can be played through the web, and Safari would suffice as a browser. The device pairs up with controllers to play games, and it also pairs up with a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad for work scenarios. Gesture control may become outdated, so focusing on non-peripheral control would be the right choice.Apple's Vision Pro headset has received mixed reactions from consumers, with some skeptical of its marketing demos and others seeing potential for new use cases. The headset uses gesture control and cameras that are said to be more widely available, but there are concerns about its ergonomic design and potential for causing headaches. Despite this, some see potential for a new market of remote immersive experiences, including NBA games. Apple's previous product launches suggest that Vision Pro will likely improve with future iterations, but its 1.0 launch may still fall short of user expectations.Apple's new VR headset, the Vision Pro, is causing mixed reactions from early reviews and user comments. Some praise it for its high quality and immersive experience, while others note common issues with VR such as headaches, nausea, and motion sickness. Despite this, many are hopeful for Apple's track record of delivering quality products and their development strategy. Some also argue that VR for work, specifically for meetings, is not necessary or desirable and that practical issues, such as acne from prolonged headset use, may be difficult to solve. The potential impact of VR on the sports industry is also discussed, with some suggesting that VR experiences could significantly cut into the profits of live sports events.The conversation is about the potential market increase in sports from moving to a digital experience over a physical one. By selling virtual seats at a lower price, teams can widen their customer base beyond those who can afford to attend live games. There is still a concern about the value of the virtual experience, with a movie ticket price of $200 for a VR seat. However, having a limited number of physical seats and demand being bigger than supply, teams could make up for the potential loss of value by tapping into a new global market of virtual attendees.",

Photograph: DoD/AFP/Getty ImagesUFOsUS urged to reveal UFO evidence after claim that it has intact alien vehiclesWhistleblower former intelligence official says government possesses \u2018intact and partially intact\u2019 craft of non-human originAdam Gabbatt@adamgabbattTue 6 Jun 2023 16.42 EDTFirst published on Tue 6 Jun 2023 13.54 EDTThe US has been urged to disclose evidence of UFOs after a whistleblower former intelligence official said the government has possession of \u201cintact and partially intact\u201d alien vehicles.The former intelligence official David Grusch, who led analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) within a US Department of Defense agency, has alleged that the US has craft of non-human origin.Most UFOs \u2013 like the Chinese spy balloon \u2013 can be explained away. But what about the other 2%?Heather DixonRead moreInformation on these vehicles is being illegally withheld from Congress, Grusch told the Debrief. Grusch said when he turned over classified information about the vehicles to Congress he suffered retaliation from government officials. He left the government in April after a 14-year career in US intelligence.Jonathan Grey, a current US intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (Nasic), confirmed the existence of \u201cexotic materials\u201d to the Debrief, adding: \u201cWe are not alone.\u201dThe disclosures come after a swell of credible sightings and reports have revived attention in alien ships, and potentially visits, in recent years.In 2021, the Pentagon released a report on UAP \u2013 the term is preferred to UFO by much of the extraterrestrial community \u2013 which found more than 140 instances of UAP encounters that could not be explained.The report followed a leak of military footage that showed apparently inexplicable happenings in the sky, while navy pilots testified that they had frequently had encounters with strange craft off the US coast.In an interview with the Debrief journalists Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal, who previously exposed the existence of a secret Pentagon program that investigated UFOs, Grusch said the US government and defense contractors had been recovering fragments of non-human craft, and in some cases entire craft, for decades.\u201cWe are not talking about prosaic origins or identities,\u201d Grusch said. \u201cThe material includes intact and partially intact vehicles.\u201dGrusch told the Debrief that analysis determined that this material is \u201cof exotic origin\u201d \u2013 meaning \u201cnon-human intelligence, whether extraterrestrial or unknown origin\u201d.\u201c[This assessment is] based on the vehicle morphologies and material science testing and the possession of unique atomic arrangements and radiological signatures,\u201d Grusch said.Grey, who, according to the Debrief, analyzes unexplained anomalous phenomena within the Nasic, confirmed Grusch\u2019s account.\u201cThe non-human intelligence phenomenon is real. We are not alone,\u201d Grey said. \u201cRetrievals of this kind are not limited to the United States. This is a global phenomenon, and yet a global solution continues to elude us.\u201dThe Debrief spoke to several of Grusch\u2019s former colleagues, each of whom vouched for his character. Karl E Nell, a retired army colonel, said Grusch was \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d. In a 2022 performance review seen by the Debrief, Grusch was described as \u201can officer with the strongest possible moral compass\u201d.Nick Pope, who spent the early 1990s investigating UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence (MoD), said Grusch and Grey\u2019s account of alien materials was \u201cvery significant\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have stories on the conspiracy blogs, but this takes it to the next level, with genuine insiders coming forward,\u201d Pope said.\u201cWhen these people make these formal complaints, they do so on the understanding that if they\u2019ve knowingly made a false statement, they are liable to a fairly hefty fine, and/or prison.\u201cPeople say: \u2018Oh, people make up stories all the time.\u2019 But I think it\u2019s very different to go before Congress and go to the intelligence community inspector general and do that. Because there will be consequences if it emerges that this is not true.\u201dThe Debrief reported that Grusch\u2019s knowledge of non-human materials and vehicles was based on \u201cextensive interviews with high-level intelligence officials\u201d. He said he had reported the existence of a UFO material \u201crecovery program\u201d to Congress.\u201cGrusch said that the craft recovery operations are ongoing at various levels of activity and that he knows the specific individuals, current and former, who are involved,\u201d the Debrief reported.In the Debrief article, Grusch does not say he has personally seen alien vehicles, nor does he say where they may be being stored. He asked the Debrief to withhold details of retaliation by government officials due to an ongoing investigation.He also does not specify how he believes the government retaliated against him.In June 2021, a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that from 2004 to 2021 there were 144 encounters between military pilots and UAP, 80 of which were captured on multiple sensors. Only one of the 144 encounters could be explained with \u201chigh confidence\u201d \u2013 it was a large, deflating balloon.Following increased interest from the public and some US senators, the Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, charged with tracking UAP, in July 2022.In December last year, the office said it had received \u201cseveral hundred\u201d new reports, but no evidence so far of alien life.The publication of Grusch and Grey\u2019s claims comes after a panel that the US space agency Nasa charged with investigating unexplained anomalous phenomena said stigma around reporting encounters \u2013 and harassment of those who do report encounters \u2013 was hindering its work.The navy pilots who in 2021 shared their experiences of encountering unexplained objects while conducting military flights said they, and others, had decided against reporting the encounters internally, because of fears it could hinder their careers.\u201cHarassment only leads to further stigmatization of the UAP field, significantly hindering the scientific progress and discouraging others to study this important subject matter,\u201d Nasa\u2019s science chief, Nicola Fox, said in a public meeting on 31 May.Dr David Spergel, the independent chair of Nasa\u2019s UAP independent study team, told the Guardian he did not know Grusch and had no knowledge of his claims.The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement, a Nasa spokesperson said: \u201cOne of Nasa\u2019s key priorities is the search for life elsewhere in the universe, but so far, NASA has not found any credible evidence of extraterrestrial life and there is no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial. However, Nasa is exploring the solar system and beyond to help us answer fundamental questions, including whether we are alone in the universe.\u201dPope said in his work investigating UFOs for the MoD he had seen no hard evidence of non-human craft or materials.\u201cSome of our cases were intriguing,\u201d Pope said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have a spaceship in a hangar anywhere. And if we did, they didn\u2019t tell me.\u201dStill, Pope said, Grusch\u2019s claims should be seen as part of an increasing flow of information \u2013 and hopefully disclosures \u2013 about UFOs.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s part of a wider puzzle. And I think, assuming this is all true, it takes us closer than we\u2019ve ever been before to the very heart of all this.\u201dRichard Luscombe contributed reportingTopicsUFOsSpacenewsReuse this contentMost viewedUS urged to reveal UFO evidence after claim that it has intact alien vehiclesShortsighted woman tells sexual assault trial she was tricked by girl posing as boyBiden \u2018knew of Ukrainian plan to attack Nord Stream\u2019 three months before explosionOrigins of masturbation traced back to primates 40m years agoTwo killed and five injured in Virginia shooting after high school graduation",

    "hn_content": "US urged to reveal UFO evidence after claim of intact alien vehicles. There is an upsurge of UFO and alien-related media in the past 2-5 years. People speculate whether it is a manipulation of social media narrative or something otherworldly. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary trust, and people don't trust those making these claims. The military is releasing UFO videos and patenting sci-fi level technology, possibly as another ham-fisted recruitment effort. The government is studying these phenomena, though they refer to them as \"phenomena\" and not \"aliens\" or \"objects,\" which has raised concerns and questions. People should keep an open mind and be scientific about evaluating what is happening, but we should prioritize eliminating the more mundane explanations.The article discusses the possibility of alien craft and the military's response. Some suggest the idea of a psyop or misinformation campaign, while others believe the possibility of extraterrestrial life should not be dismissed entirely. The military's job is to counter foreign threats, not to placate conspiracy theorists. The most recent claims are based on hearsay and have no solid evidence. People's interpretations of events may be subjective and influenced by prior beliefs. Ultimately, the possibility of alien life is not impossible but requires scrutiny and a rational approach to investigating any evidence that arises.A former government official claiming that the US has recovered a crashed alien spaceship and has studied its technology in secret has provoked a range of responses on Hacker News. Some commenters express skepticism about the validity of his claims, while others argue that the US government could be hiding genuine information about extraterrestrial activity. Some of the comments focus on the human tendency to over-interpret evidence in ways that suit our biases or expectations, while others suggest conspiratorial explanations for the lack of information or the source's reluctance to release purportedly classified documents. The article sparks discussion about the relationship between science fiction and actual technological advancement, the limits of human knowledge, and the challenges of evaluating the possible existence of advanced life beyond Earth.Reports of UFO sightings and encounters with strange craft off the US coast are gaining credibility, despite many people dismissing these claims as conspiracy theories. A former US official who claims to have overseen secret government programs researching UFOs has testified before Congress and confirmed that the US government is in possession of materials believed to have been recovered from \"unidentified aerial phenomena\". The former official says the materials have undergone scientific analysis and are judged to be of a non-human origin. Naturally, many people are skeptical about this claim and suspect it's a psyop designed to manipulate public perception. Others point to leaked military footage showing apparently inexplicable events in the sky and conclude that these sightings and encounters with UFOs are credible.The DoD and related agencies have been releasing information about UFOs in the past few years. One theory is that they are claiming they've found alien crafts and exotic materials because the US is testing aircraft that appear alien with exotic materials and don't want other nation states to assume that it is even terrestrial so that they don't attempt to replicate the technology. There are numerous other reasons for the release of this information, including hiding advanced defense programs, confusing potential enemy intelligence efforts, and shaking out moles, spies, and unreliable people/leakers. Additionally, propaganda operations have unintended consequences, and experiments on the population's willingness to believe the government are at most a side effect. Despite the military's recent information releases, there is no concrete evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life or visitation.Former intelligence official, Luis Elizondo, claims that the US government possesses craft of non-human origin. However, skeptics suggest this is merely a misdirection to cover US or Chinese weapons tech. Elizondo gave sworn testimony to Congress on the matter, but some argue he could be mentally ill or lying with no consequences. The debate centers on the idea of interstellar travel for alien civilizations and whether or not it is possible. Despite the controversy, Elizondo's claims have gained traction due to his background in the intelligence community and the official backing of his statements. Some onlookers view this news as part of a CIA psyop to distract from the Snowden anniversary, while others are excited about the possibility of alien contact.Commentary and opinions are exchanged about the idea that aliens seem to frequent the USA, with some arguing that they would be more interested in countries with alternative strengths such as tech manufacturing. Some individuals focus on the success of the US relative to other countries and the reasons behind that success. Others discuss the subjectivity of measuring success and the possibility that aliens may have different priorities. There is brief discussion on the idea of cultural values and how that has influenced the Civilization game franchise. Last, some individuals question the concept of inequality and its impact on a society.The conversation started with a comment that the US couldn't manufacture iPhones. Another commenter argued that the US has the technology and the capability to manufacture iPhones and other similar devices. The conversation then spiraled into a discussion about what criteria an advanced alien species would use to judge human civilization and which country is winning at civilization. Overall, the conversation is mostly sarcastic and not entirely related to technology news.Reports of recent UFO sightings have sparked discussions about their cultural significance and potential implications. Some believe that the US may be more likely to detect UFOs due to its advanced avionics technology or cultural factors. However, others suggest that sightings of UFOs are a global phenomenon and retrieval events have been reported worldwide. The cultural fascination with aliens has its roots in the US since the late 1940s, and it has since become embedded in US culture and media through movies and TV shows. Meanwhile, on a different note, drone technology has improved significantly, leading to mesmerizing footage of coordinated and synchronized patterns at events such as shows and race events.",

Additionally, the chip is capable of running general-purpose OS, making it usable for various applications, including gaming. The chip's name and emphasis on its capabilities for AI are some of its notable features.Nvidia's new 8nm H100 GPU is currently selling to larger buyers, with a starting price of $30,000 per GPU for the 80GB version. It is unclear when or if the 96GB version will be available to individuals. The GPU has both CPU and GPU memory, with direct-access memory that is much faster for the GPU than PCIe. Nvidia's dominance in the GPGPU space is due in large part to their development and support of CUDA for the past 15 years, allowing for easy universal support on every chip and platform. The market is in need of more competition, as Nvidia's position may lead to increasingly bad deals for consumers.NVIDIA's RTX 4090 is much more powerfulExperts on Hacker News discuss the difference between humans learning to drive and AI learning to drive. They compare the pre-trained fine motor control and visual perception that humans have encoded in their genetics, to AI, which only knows what it has been taught by humans. They acknowledge that AI is faster and potentially more efficient than humans, but the complexity of brains cannot be fully emulated by silicon-based machines. They also discuss the capabilities and limitations of GPT-4 in imitating language and reasoning, and the need to understand its computational limits. The discussion provides valuable insights into the current state and potential future of AI and its relationship with human brainpower.",
