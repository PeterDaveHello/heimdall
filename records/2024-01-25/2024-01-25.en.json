    "originBody": "Zed is now open source Nathan Sobo January 24th, 2024 We're excited to announce that Zed is now an open source project. The code for Zed itself is available under a copyleft license to ensure any improvements will benefit the entire community (GPL for the editor, AGPL for server-side components). GPUI, the UI framework that powers Zed, is distributed under the Apache 2 license, so that you can use it to build high-performance desktop applications and distribute them under any license you choose. You can find all of the code on GitHub. Motivations Why are we doing this? Most importantly, we believe that making Zed open source will make it the best product. Our mission is to build the world's most advanced code editor and get it into the hands of millions of developers. There's a ton of surface area on that problem, and we'll need all the help we can get. Considering that all of Zed's users are programmers, it makes the most sense sense to open Zed to the maximum pool of talent. On a more selfish level, we also think going open source will be a lot more fun. One of our favorite aspects of software is connecting with people. We're not only proud of what we've built, but also of how we've built it. We want to share Zed's inner beauty with all of you, and we're confident we'll learn a lot from you in the process to make it even better. Introducing Fireside Hacks Motivated by our desire to connect with you all on a human level, we're launching a new Zed feature called Zed Channels, which will make it easy for developers anywhere in the world to write code together in real time just by sharing a link. Starting tomorrow, we'll be using Channels to run a new program called Fireside Hacks, in which we'll be working on Zed live in a public channel, together with whoever shows up. We'll be experimenting with different formats, but we're hoping these regular sessions give us all an opportunity to get to know each other better, beyond what's possible in a static pull request. Come join the experiment to ask questions, make suggestions, and code with us in real time. We're looking forward to meeting you! Wait... Doesn't Cash Rule Everything Around Me? We strongly believe that the best way to build and maintain the world's best editor is by associating it with a sustainable business model. It's the only way we can continue to invest in a full-time team to spearhead development. Some may wonder whether making Zed open source undermines this objective. We've thought about this a lot, and we don't think that openness is at odds with commercial success. Rather than selling you a proprietary editor, we'd much prefer to sell you services that seamlessly integrate with your editor to make you and your team more productive. Zed Channels is one example of such a service. It's free for anyone today, but we intend to begin charging for private use after a beta period of experimentation. Providing server-side compute to power AI features is another monetization scheme we're seeing getting traction. Today, we're open sourcing 100% of the code we've written so far. In the future, however, we may still offer proprietary products targeting commercial and enterprise use cases, though we always intend for proprietary code to be a tiny fraction compared to the code we open source. We also intend to ensure our need to generate revenue never interferes with your need to write software. We're never going to show you a banner ad in your code editor, and if we do, you can always build Zed from source. We believe in the principle of creating more value than we capture. Going open source is a bet that if we can build a huge movement around Zed, our company will find opportunities to capture some of the value we create. The Road to 1.0 So what's next? To some extent, that's up to you! But it's also true that we're still a small team. We want to massively grow adoption in 2024 so that more developers can benefit from Zed, and we've put together a public roadmap based on user feedback that we think can help us get there. If your contributions help us make progress toward completing that roadmap, especially items near the top, we'll be more likely to make time for them. That said, we're going to figure this out as we go, and we welcome anyone who is excited to contribute and learn. If you'd like to get involved, check out our contribution guide, and come say hello at an upcoming Fireside Hack if you have the time. Developers everywhere need a better code editor, and we're excited for you to join us on our mission to advance the state of the art. See you in the codebase! Interested in trying Zed out?

    "commentBody": "Zed, a collaborative code editor, is now open source (zed.dev)1208 points by FeroTheFox 16 hours agohidepastfavorite425 comments Octoth0rpe 15 hours agoI'm generally a big fan of zed and have been using it for 60%ish of my dev time for 6 months or so. A couple of nice things to note: - It really is remarkably responsive,and makes one really notice how UNresponsive everything else is. I have reasonably fast machines, so we're not talking about the difference between 5ms typing lag and 500ms, but it's still pretty surprising. VSCode never felt slow on my macs until I started using Zed. - They seem reasonably responsive to feedback. There was some contention around how search/replace was initially implemented, and the current builds have something much more usable IMO. I'm not sure how much that was driven by community feedback, but the changes were great. - The debug syntax tree mode is a really neat feature that I think demonstrates how much more advanced zed is under the hood than older editors that are doing syntax highlighting via regex. There are a few downsides that I'm hoping get addressed soon: - The collaboration workflow/security isn't very clear to me. You sign in via github (no other option???), there are 'contacts' (I guess these are github usernames?), and 'channels' (where do these live? on zed's servers?). I would really like to know if I can self-host the chat server and use a company oauth provider rather than github. If the diffs being passed around are going through zed's servers, that may be a showstopper for the company I work for as well. If they're p2p and encrypted, maybe not. - I would love to see ollama integration. This + continue is the only reason why I spend any amount of time in vscode now. There's an issue for it here: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/4424 reply benreesman 10 hours agoparentI’m really picky about my tools in general and latency in particular, and I give Zed a spin from time to time, it’s sweet. Clean, minimal design aesthetic, tree-sitter, tight code, it’s a nice bit of work and I dig it a lot. But emacs 29 with the right flags and a tuned GC (no one does this! it’s got a heap-size from the 80s!) is just as snappy and has more amazing packages than VSCode. There’s a market for people who want something snappier than VSCode but less labor-intensive to set up than emacs, and I wish them luck: I think it’s a front runner there. But I can’t imagine switching my main axe up with a holy shit moment a lot crazier than tree-sitter in 2024 and not having the render loop be in JS. reply jitl 9 hours agorootparentHow do you get a reasonably fancy Emacs to start up/open files quickly? Every time I try to get into EMacs after adding a few packages it becomes painfully slow to open a file for editing. Then I try to understand Emacs server, then I fail / give up and go back to vim. reply mkesper 2 hours agorootparentUse doomemacs for a start.

At least that’s how I worked with my vim tmux sessions ;) reply lynx23 1 hour agorootparentprevI was about to answer \"Use emacsclient\", but then I realized you can't be bothered to configure it. For me, putting \"(server-start)\" into .emacs was always enough, but YMMV. reply nccnm 9 hours agorootparentprevCan you share more about your Emacs 29 setup? Thanks reply dataangel 6 hours agorootparentprevwhat are the right flags and gc tunings? reply da39a3ee 5 hours agorootparentprev> But I can’t imagine switching my main axe up with a holy shit moment a lot crazier than tree-sitter in 2024 and not having the render loop be in JS. Congratulations for winning HN sentence of the year before the end of January. reply darthrupert 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople are asking what settings would be useful to tweak. Check out the following: - gcmh -package and gcmh-mode and/or gc-cons-threshold variable (former should take over the latter) - read-process-output-max - jit-lock-defer-time - package-native-compile Doom Emacs sets gcmh in its initialization so tweaking that might not be needed there. You may still want to touch gcmh-high-cons-threshold and gcmh-idle-delay-factor. Here are mine currently: (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024 1024)) (setq gcmh-high-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024 1024)) (setq gcmh-idle-delay-factor 20) (setq jit-lock-defer-time 0.05) (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) (setq package-native-compile t) I've done nothing scientific to check out if these help at all, though, so take them with salt. With and without these, emacs seems quite sluggish at least on a Macbook, in certain modes. On Linux things seem to be a bit better. reply natrys 8 minutes agorootparentThe thing about gc-cons-threshold is that, too low a value and it will collect garbage too frequently. While a high value will drastically reduce frequency, but then GC pause will be big and you will likely feel whole system freeze and stutter when it happens. For me, 1GB is too high because I sorta notice the pause, I set it to 32MB but completely disable GC when minibuffer is active: (defun my-minibuffer-setup-hook () (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)) (defun my-minibuffer-exit-hook () (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 32 1024 1024))) (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'my-minibuffer-setup-hook) (add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook #'my-minibuffer-exit-hook) Eli Zaretskii (current Emacs maintainer) also thinks 1GB is too high, though for somewhat different reason: https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bg85qm/garbage_colle... Anyway, I also have these in my init (I nicked these from Doom which I don't use but they have done a lot of work to dive deep into these things, mostly around what improves start up but the following might help in general): ;; if you don't use RTL ever, this could improve perf (setq-default bidi-display-reordering 'left-to-right bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right bidi-inhibit-bpa t) ;; improves terminal emulator (vterm/eat) throughput (setq read-process-output-max (* 2 1024 1024) process-adaptive-read-buffering nil) (setq fast-but-imprecise-scrolling t redisplay-skip-fontification-on-input t inhibit-compacting-font-caches t) (setq idle-update-delay 1.0) reply manupanday1998 6 hours agorootparentprevYes you are correct reply appplication 3 hours agoparentprevVSCode has always felt incredibly slow to me, even compared to e.g. pycharm. , which I have always assumed of be otherwise roughly comparable. VSC’s lag in basic code inspection and linting became so annoying I had to switch off it. We’re not talking seconds, but maybe tenths of second lag, for everything at all times. I understand plenty of people love VSC, but honestly I have never been able to share that enthusiasm. reply ahmedfromtunis 2 hours agorootparentYep. For some reason, suddenly, vscode became painfully slow on my decently spec'd machine; 3 to 7 seconds per keystroke just to analyse the file to show intellisense tooltips. Yes, that was in seconds per keystroke. The irony is that I moved from neovim to vscode because setting up intellisense in (neo)vim was always a hassle and never worked quite well. Pylance seemed too attractive not to give it a spin. Now the lag has as mysteriously diminished, but still vscode is very far from being as snappy as (n)vim. reply McBeige 2 hours agoparentprevIve been wanting a syntax-tree-viewer for months, to help me learn functional languages where figuring out what is even going on syntax-wise in the exmaples provided by tutorials keeps being an issue for me. Does anyone know of a way to see a syntax tree for any given snippet of code for any given language? I'd try Zed, but I'll have to wait for Linux support. reply flexagoon 12 hours agoparentprev> older editors that are doing syntax highlighting via regex. I mean, Emacs, which can probably be considered the oldest code editor at this point, got built-in tree-sitter (which is what Zed uses under the hood) support in the last release. So it's not really related to editors being new or old reply dnsco 10 hours agorootparentIt's not just tree-sitter that makes zed feel snappy. If you're using a reasonably fast language-server, which rust-analyzer apparently is (I didn't know this using vscode), the autocomplete & intentions feel instantaneous. I think the team has learned a lot from previous editor implementations (they were the core team of atom that was notoriously slow), and so they've had an opportunity to do a lot of stuff right. FWIW they also are the team that originally wrote tree-sitter. The quickness feels more like it's in the core of the editor. I was shocked how much it impacted the editing experience when I tried it in early beta. reply widdershins 2 hours agorootparentI've been impressed with the C++ clangd language server snappiness in Zed compared to both CLion (my old favorite) and Emacs (apple of my eye for 2.5 yrs). I always thought the major slowness was coming from clangd itself, so I'm surprised and impressed to see that Zed appears to be quicker on this front. I might be using Zed as a 'second opinion' editor because of this. However, now I'm used to the infinite customizability and coziness of Emacs, it's going to be hard for me to move across to Zed permanently. reply erk__ 2 hours agorootparentEmacs have some issues with LSP speed because of the json parsing not being the fastest which have lead to work like this: https://github.com/blahgeek/emacs-lsp-booster. reply FridgeSeal 7 hours agorootparentprev> If you're using a reasonably fast language-server, which rust-analyzer apparently is (I didn't know this using vscode) Some more anecdata to back this up: initial workspace load in VScode I can watch RA tick through its progress. Clean and boot up Zed and the same process is so fast that it’s almost unbelievable. reply The_Colonel 3 hours agorootparentprevAs I understand, tree-sitter implementation in Emacs is currently more like a foundation for development / adoption by plugins, it's not really usable as-is today. reply nequo 2 hours agorootparentEmacs already had tree-sitter before 29, just not built in. You can do syntax highlighting[1] and structured editing with it.[2] What is missing for it to be usable in your view? [1] https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/ [2] https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter reply epcoa 2 hours agorootparentprevYour understanding is outdated/incorrect. Already a number of major modes have corresponding ts modes and I use them daily. This includes C++, Rust, Python, yaml, toml, json, Java, typescript, dockerfile and cmake. True not every major mode has treesitter in the official release but I’d hardly call the above “not usable” reply akam4n4n 6 hours agoparentprevhow to you use ollama with vscode? some links/ details would help me a lot! reply Octoth0rpe 6 hours agorootparentI use this extension: https://continue.dev/ their docs are pretty good, but it's also evolving pretty rapidly. For example, you no longer need to run the continue server yourself, it's entirely self contained in the vs code extension. I believe the docs still refer to how to run it manually. I work for a pretty conservative company re: GAI, and the ollama + continue combo made it through legal. reply mjaniczek 13 hours agoparentprevNow I wonder what's the typing lag of 10xeditor, compared to Zed... reply rob74 13 hours agoparentprev> VSCode never felt slow on my macs until I started using Zed. I guess you haven't used Sublime Text before? reply bastawhiz 13 hours agorootparentI switched _to_ VSCode because Sublime was occasionally so slow at times that it was unusable. It was very fast 95% of the time, but then I'd `git pull` on a very big repo and my machine would become unresponsive while Sublime did...something. reply ben-schaaf 10 hours agorootparentSublime Text 4166 has some major improvements in that area, previously ST would check every file in the side bar for changes in order to update its index but this is now done incrementally. reply Player6225 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is very strange to me, because I have always used Sublime Text for super-giant corporate repos, and always found it snappy compared to vscode. Wonder if it was a specific usecase or something... Every little while, I try to make vscode my main editor, because I enjoy all the features. I always switch back to Sublime just because VSCode's slowness bugs me. Haven't really tried Zed in earnest yet, though, because of no custom LSP support. reply GrumpySloth 11 hours agorootparentprevI think on Linux at least it freezes due to watching too many files using inotify to update its sidebar. I wish there was an option to disable that. Same thing happens with Sublime Merge. It’s unusable on giant repos. reply Octoth0rpe 13 hours agorootparentprevNot in 15ish years and at the time I think I had a 5400rpm hd, so that probably limited any perception of sublime being noticeably faster than other editors I was using (geany, kate). I don't doubt that sublime is faster than vscode today, but the vscode ecosystem is a pretty nice place to be and probably worth trading some speed for, especially on a nice mac where the trade off is probably small. Zed might be even better however. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentprevOr vim, I suppose. It's remarkable how slow VSCode actually is, but I still use it because I hate configuring vim and packages always break when upgrading, it's honestly worse than npm. reply herjazz 6 hours agorootparentAre you sure that’s vim rather than Melvin. Never had any issues with anything breaking on an upgrade using vim. reply satvikpendem 1 hour agorootparentNot sure what Melvin is. I've always had issues, specifically when I have lots of packages, such as when installing stuff through lazy.vim. reply stevage 13 hours agorootparentprevI had to stop using sublime because it kept updating its search index at inconvenient times and slowing to a crawl. That and self updating in ways that broke my most important plugin. reply SnowingXIV 13 hours agorootparentI’m still using Sublime for the references. Without fail I can load up any version of an application including older rails apps sub 3 and it instantly has context. I can easily jump to definitions and even on hover will show me where they are being used. In the context of foos.bars.baz I could easily infer where bars is defined. Seems to work across languages, doesn’t matter if it’s js, ruby, in an erb file it just works. Not to mention the flavor of vim feels great. VSCode complains and I’ve got to hardcode an alternative absolute path gemfile for Shopify’s LSP to work. It also feels clunkier, even on powerful machines. If Zed can give parity with Sublime on the references (I just tried and it did not seem to find any references when clearly bars was there) might be an interesting change. Considering it’s open source now I’d happily switch as it does seems super quick. I might also be old-man yells at cloud and the copilot integration doesn’t appear important yet, but current sublime support is pretty poor for it and seems like that’ll be a thing more and more. reply nicoburns 11 hours agorootparentprevI was hitting that bug for about 6 months, but at least for me they have actually fixed it now. reply bayindirh 13 hours agorootparentprevor BBEdit. reply reddalo 11 hours agorootparentprevCries in PhpStorm reply tiffanyh 15 hours agoprev> GPL for the editor, AGPL for server-side components).

Would be great if you could import VSCode themes into Zed All above has tickets open. ---- Hope these small things get addressed because I truly love the elegant UI design of Zed For those who haven't used Zed, it's the first GUI editor I've used in 25-years of development that wasn't distracting. It's hard to describe how much more focused I am when not distracted with a Christmas tree scene of icons, menus, colors, etc. like you see in other editors. Zed is very calming, due to its focus on not having distractions. Give it a try if you haven't. reply mcdonje 11 hours agoparentThe licensing choice is smart. \"Permissive\" licenses permit closing off something built largely on the work of the open source community. Zed is made by the Atom guy and the Tree Sitter guy. Atom was MIT licensed. I wouldn't be surprised if he's thinking the MIT license is the path to VS-Zed. reply bschwindHN 7 hours agoparentprevFunny you mention that because I felt Zed had _too many_ buttons & icons for things compared to Sublime Text. I feel they could do without the dedicated stuff for GPT/Copilot and others, and sweep them away to the command palette. reply kefabean 12 hours agoparentprevI do agree it's very zen using zed. As you say the interface is elegant and distraction free by default, no twiddling required to get a happy place. So far I've only used it for my personal projects and don't yet have full muscle memory, but weirdly even the keyboard shortcuts seem more intuitive. reply mixmastamyk 13 hours agoparentprevWhich GUI editors don't allow you to hide toolbars and widgets? Or is it the defaults that appeal to you? reply philsnow 12 hours agoprevI opened a random python project on my machine in Zed and it automatically loaded up an LSP for python. It looks like it's using the same one as my emacs uses (pyright), but it presents completion choices in a not particularly useful order. Typing `os.p` gives me for instance as completion choices: pwritev pwrite putenv popen pipe path P_ALL P_PID pread pardir P_PGID P_WAIT ... but then I type 'a' and then backspace and it gives some of the same choices, but in a different order P_ALL path pread pardir P_WAIT [etc] here's a gif of it, I'm just typing and backspacing through \"os.path\" and watching the completions be in an unguessable order: https://snap.philsnow.io/2024-01-24T13-57-09.q7pyi8re104uqhn... Is pyright just giving Zed all the possibilities and it's up to Zed to rank them? I don't know the details of editor/LSP integration. lsp-whatever in emacs ranks these choices in a reasonable order. reply thearrow 8 hours agoparentI’m also curious about the answer to this! I noticed similar behavior when opening a Typescript project. Enjoy the low latency, but I’d also appreciate accurate/helpful autocomplete suggestions. reply dr_kiszonka 3 hours agoparentprevInteresting.

However, has it been written with cross-platform support in mind? Otherwise, porting from mac to linux could be rather painful and time-consuming... Will there be an ETA for us linux users? I saw it on the roadmap [0] but without an ETA. [0] https://zed.dev/roadmap reply kvark 15 hours agorootparentprevHow are you planning to tackle the GPU API differences? reply 1propionyl 15 hours agorootparent(Not OP) These days that's a lot less of a concern than it used to be. It is a lot of up-front work to facade e.g. Metal, Vulkan (and even D3D12) but it's much much much easier than back in OpenGL vs D3D9/10 days. Most of the general concepts are more or less the same across them all these days. The \"shapes\" of the APIs are very similar. A texture is a texture is a texture. Same for a vertex/index/uniform buffer, vertex/fragment/compute shaders (notably not geometry, but you can just use compute), etc. reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 14 hours agorootparentI'm not in the graphics world at all, but I read this lively discussion last week (post [0], discussion [1]) that made me think the situation was pretty messy. Is it maybe not as bad as that makes it appear? [0] https://www.carette.xyz/posts/we_are_doomed/ [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38994780 reply raphlinus 14 hours agorootparentI'd recommend wgpu. It should be a fairly easy migration from Metal, as Apple has been actively involved in the design, and there are similar concerns for developer experience (unlike, say, Vulkan). Unfortunately, graphics is in many ways the easy part. Really excellent integration with system menus, preferences, keyboard, input method editing, all have more variation across platforms and a still-evolving story of solid Rust abstractions. Lately, we've decided to try joining forces with the winit project to see if we can get those problems solved well. reply shortrounddev2 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat about Windows? reply misternugget 15 hours agorootparentI think that is on the roadmap too, but possibly further down. reply archon810 9 hours agorootparentIs there some place I can subscribe to the Windows release notification? reply c0balt 4 hours agorootparentMaybe the tracking issue for Windows support: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/5394 reply JellyBeanThief 8 hours agorootparentprevPossibly https://www.google.com/alerts? reply cpuguy83 14 hours agorootparentprevSince you are here I'll hijack the thread :) What about remote support ala vscode-server over SSH. reply c-c-c-c-c 14 hours agorootparentPlease not ala vscode-server over SSH.

It pulls binaries from MS servers and runs a headless vscode instance on the remote machine. You are dead in the water if you target a machine/architecture it doesnt support. You want to target FreeBSD? Linux on POWER or RISC-V? An old (ARMV6-TDMI) Raspberry Pi? Sorry, no remote work for you. They are not an apple and pears comparison... reply klyrs 13 hours agorootparentprevI'd suggest that the people who make \"full use\" of vsc-over-ssh are satisfied with vscode, so it would be unwise to target the full featureset. More generally, targeting another project's complete featureset is often a great way to get mired down in the wrong details. Unless you can afford to do a proper cleanroom -- then, you'll be able to at least match the performance and useful abstractions used in the original. reply rand_flip_bit 12 hours agorootparent> I'd suggest that the people who make \"full use\" of vsc-over-ssh are satisfied with vscode, so it would be unwise to target the full featureset. Remote SSH + Dev Containers and their seamless integration (even stacking one on the other) are the only features that keep me using VS Code. I would love to see the full implementation of these in an editor as fast and light weight as Zed. reply scottlamb 8 hours agorootparentprev> I'd suggest that the people who make \"full use\" of vsc-over-ssh are satisfied with vscode, so it would be unwise to target the full featureset. Wha...? This is a killer feature. I'll put up with a lot of crap to use it. That doesn't mean I wouldn't switch to something nicer in other ways if it also offered this killer feature. It's hard for me to understand why there are IDEs under active development not trying to offer this feature. It is so much better an experience to have the network split into the proper place: between the UI and the heavy computation. Having the UI too far away undoes whatever responsiveness work has been done and more. Having the heavy computation too near means it's hard to develop and test the far environment, take advantage of its compute, etc. reply cultofmetatron 2 hours agorootparentprev> the people who make \"full use\" of vsc-over-ssh are satisfied with vscode, almost all my coding these days is over vsc-ssh. if zed supported sshing into a remote host and into a docker container as seamlessly as I can in vscode, Id switch immediately.

There is someone who reads that agreeing it means the editor should be just a plugin store and if you want font hinting, syntax coloring, tabs, terminals, smooth scrolling, and so on then download them yourself. At the same time there is someone who reads that agreeing it means the editor should have anything possible related to working with text but if you want to play a video while you code the plugin system should allow you to do that in a pane. Neither are really right or wrong about what should be a plugin, it's really a matter of what the tool wants to optimize for out of the box. reply robin_reala 13 hours agoprevReally nice and fast (which is the reason I’m still using Sublime instead of VS Code). I’ve only found one piece of functionality that’s dramatically slow compared to Sublime so far: selecting all of the current highlight. In my current file I have 2,396 occurrences of ``. Selecting all of them in Sublime (with ctrl + cmd + g) is certainly less than 200ms. Doing the same in Zed (with cmd + shift + l) beachballs my machine for around 5 secs.

Everybody is constantly available in a channel and people just hop in or out. In the last 7 days I spent 3-5hrs every day pairing with others, using Zed's live mode. No video, only audio and sharing code in Zed (no video was weird at first, but now I think I'm starting to get used to it?) IMHO it's a combination of culture and technology, but when the mix of that is right it really feels game-changing. reply Aeolun 10 hours agorootparentI think what’s nice is that it’s frictionless. If I can just click a button to see someone’s editor, then there’s no dance with sharing screen, I can open files I need to see, etc. With standard sharing you always end up trying to direct people to do things instead of just showing them. reply cauthon 15 hours agorootparentprev> In the last 7 days I spent 3-5hrs every day pairing with others This sounds remarkably inefficient? reply volsa_ 14 hours agorootparentAre you kidding?

I unfortunately don't have a mac but I appreciate it :) reply zzyzxd 15 hours agoparentprevWhen a person tells another person \"you need to do X\" or \"I did Y and it didn't work on my machine\", they sometimes ignore important details due to their own curse of knowledge. That's when I need a shared terminal/editor so that both parties know exactly what is happening. I don't frequently share terminal/editor but occasionally need to do so, maybe a handful times a year. Most of times when I tell a new colleague \"hey, connect to my tmux socket by running this command / opening this link\", they were amazed and thought it was magical. I am not a Zed user but it's always welcome to see people making effort to make pair programming easier for everyone. Now, I don't know how I would feel if one day my colleague send me a sharing session link that can only be opened by a particular editor. reply candiddevmike 16 hours agoparentprevThe benefit as a viewer is you can drive navigation on your own without asking the presenter to go to a certain spot. So the presenter can be discussing a problem or a function, and you can investigate/gather context without interrupting them, among other things. I personally can't live without it, and am almost annoyed when folks aren't using VSCode/have no way of doing a live share. Screen share sucks. reply kevsim 13 hours agoparentprevIn our 100% remote startup, VSCode live share and Slack Huddles is how we work through the really tough stuff together. We should probably do it more often than we do, but there is a real fatigue after an hour or two. reply porsager 15 hours agoparentprevIt is such a game changer for me. Pair programming or multi pair programming if you will, suddenly has 0 barriers. Including others in your session with no overhead changes things completely. Before I would rarely include others in my processes because it cost too much. Now I'll do it whenever... Switched from sublime and got my coworkers macs just to be able to use zed and work in this way. It is extremely important it works fast and fluid, and zed is the only one I've tried that nails it. There are still a few things that needs tweaking wrt. undo history, but I'm sure they'll get that to feel intuitive in the end. reply jiripospisil 15 hours agoparentprevIt sounds nice in theory but I've noticed I cannot focus when somebody else is looking over my shoulder. It could be useful as a way to occasionally show somebody around the code base though. reply comprev 15 hours agorootparentThe anxiety of someone constantly peering over my shoulder in a virtual sense greatly amplifies any imposter syndrome already present. Every typo, every goofy idea (which clearly would not work), etc. all laid bare to see in realtime. Pair programming was the main reason I left a company after management rolled it out to every team. reply gpm 16 hours agoparentprevI've greatly enjoyed pair (and trio) programming with friends using it (vscode's version of this) on side projects. For the most part I'm not sold that pair programming is an efficient way to program, but it's a nice social way to program. If you're going to do it, especially remotely, it's really nice to have your editor support it instead of just using screen sharing. reply AlexAndScripts 15 hours agorootparentI've never really pair programmed - I've worked on joint projects, of course, but collaboration occurs over discord/github. I'm intrigued - what does this actually consist of? Does one person write one function and another write the next while you chat about what needs to be done? reply gpm 15 hours agorootparentWe tend to work on one 'thing' at a time. Sometimes that means we're both/all on the same few lines of code writing a new function - at which point one person is usually doing all or nearly all the typing. If you then need to go define a constant somewhere else in the code or something the other person does that so you don't have to pause. Other times one thing involves code in various places because you're doing something like changing what arguments a function takes, or fixing compiler warnings, and we do spread out and handle instances of the thing we're fixing as we come across them. Lines of code per second it's closer to one person than the 2 or 3 people involved, but the quality of those lines definitely improves a bit as people spot each-others mistakes/less than optimal choices.

The worst thing is that I get mad at them for not doing what I want them to, faster, when the tooling and my crooked explanations are at fault, not them.

Having real time collaboration that works so seamlessly as Zed apparently does would really get me to consider switching IDEs! reply mixmastamyk 12 hours agorootparentSeems like VNC or similar would be a better solution. Might need to use a terminal or other program. Instead of confining it to one application. reply pflanze 8 hours agorootparentI'm using VNC for coworking/mentoring sessions and it works very well for us (it's lower latency, higher frame rate, sharper picture than typical screen sharing, and allows both/all sides to interact with the session and use the mouse pointer to point to things). We're using Linux on both the server and client side. There's a full desktop on the remote side, to fully interact with that (to have key bindings go to the server instead of the local desktop) the client needs to be made full screen. Latency isn't really an issue even between central US and Europe. I've automated the set up of a Debian server for the purpose using[1].

Dozens of engineers reply aseipp 16 hours agoparentprevHonestly, it's pretty cool in my experience; in VSCode everyone gets their own \"client-side navigation\" so while you are typing something, your coworker can go look up a function for you in another file, etc. Even though they exist in \"your\" instance, they still get Go To Definition, Find References, type-on-hover, etc. Realistically though it doesn't replace every instance of screen sharing, for me. It's also cultural to some extent I guess. For things like debugging or being intro'd to a new codebase, I think it's great, though. reply yawboakye 16 hours agoparentprevime, real time sharing works best when there’s shared context. otherwise it’s essentially an artist rendering a public performance in the presence of an audience. unless you derive some joy from watching people code it could get frustrating real fast. reply pjmlp 16 hours agoparentprevSame here, for me it is a gimmick without much value over a screen sharing session. reply brimstedt 16 hours agorootparentI disagree. For example, in vscode if the sharer start a http-service the port can be port forwarded through the session so anyone in the session can interact with the service. Pretty neat and useful! reply pjmlp 14 hours agorootparentI find it as interesting as mob programming. Anyone can interact with common team servers. It is one of those things that developer advocates love to show at conferences. reply smoldesu 5 hours agorootparentMaybe I'm opening the lid to the industry's best-kept secret, but every team I've worked on used SSH with a shared tmux session for pairing.

The country demographic in the survey shows that USA makes up only 21% of responses. https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-key-territorie... reply DiabloD3 46 minutes agorootparentThe reverse of this is, I don't know how SO can validate the claim, or the accuracy of any of the results in the SO survey. If a lot of people self-select themselves to align with techbro culture, techbro culture is mainly in the Silicon Valley but not only there, and they think, for example, owning a Mac is how you signal belonging to that group (as in, Macs are a modern day Veblen good), then people who think they are (or wish they were) part of the techbro culture, no matter their location, will buy Macs. So, the claim being given by people quoting the SO survey is: SO survey responders are not mainly made up of people who self-identify as techbros or have had their purchasing decisions (such as buying a Mac) greatly influenced by techbro culture. I do not know of a way to argue that position. You can state that, literally, techbros live outside of the US, which is obviously true without quoting this survey; it however, does not mean the Silicon Valley doesn't act as an echo chamber, and doesn't have great effect on the tech industry worldwide. What I would more likely want to see is, of that 21% of America, how many live in either the Silicon Valley or the Seattle/Redmond region. As in, how many are hailing from the Chicago or New York or Dallas metros, or non-metro regions entirely. I'm guessing that, still, many would have responded that they live in either the SV or the northwest, greatly more-so than elsewhere in the US. reply svennidal 7 hours agoparentprevMost programmers I know prefer macOS above all other.

FEATURE REQUEST :) Would it be possible to have option+click+drag create multiple cursors where you drag and not a selection with cursor at the end? Basically, the behaviour that Sublime Text has—Sublime Text's multiple cursors are, frankly, awesome. I have found shift+option+drag to create a rectangle, but no way to create vertical lines of cursors through lines of text, and my favourite—drag down to the right of your code to put cursors at the end of every line. I use that all the time: scrape to the right hit ctrl+a to get to the start of a line, cut out and replace text, ctrl+e to the end, add more text etc. Really useful for turning data into code. Option+click+drag is one of the most useful features of Sublime Text and my muscle memory is stuck to it — to the point where I keep Sublime Text around purely for the feature (well, this, the fantastic sort/permute lines options, and the live-highlight of regex searches that give you instant feedback of whether your regex is working correctly).

    "title": "OpenAI Backtracks on Promise to Disclose Key Documents, Raises Concerns",
    "originLink": "https://www.wired.com/story/openai-scrapped-promise-disclose-key-documents/",
    "originBody": "BY PARESH DAVE BUSINESS JAN 24, 2024 8:00 AM OpenAI Quietly Scrapped a Promise to Disclose Key Documents to the Public From its founding, OpenAI said its governing documents were available to the public. When WIRED requested copies after the company’s boardroom drama, it declined to provide them. ILLUSTRATION: CHARIS MORGAN; GETTY IMAGES Wealthy tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk launched OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab that they said would involve society and the public in the development of powerful AI, unlike Google and other giant tech companies working behind closed doors. In line with that spirit, OpenAI’s reports to US tax authorities have from its founding said that any member of the public can review copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules. But when WIRED requested those records last month, OpenAI said its policy had changed, and the company provided only a narrow financial statement that omitted the majority of its operations. \"We provide financial statements when requested,” company spokesperson Niko Felix says. “OpenAI aligns our practices with industry standards, and since 2022 that includes not publicly distributing additional internal documents.” OpenAI’s abandonment of the long-standing transparency pledge obscures information that could shed light on the recent near-implosion of a company with crucial influence over the future of AI and could help outsiders understand its vulnerabilities. In November, OpenAI’s board fired CEO Sam Altman, implying in a statement that he was untrustworthy and had endangered its mission to ensure AI “benefits all humanity.” An employee and investor revolt soon forced the board to reinstate Altman and eject most of its own members, with an overhauled slate of directors vowing to review the crisis and enact structural changes to win back the trust of stakeholders. Access to OpenAI’s conflict-of-interest policy could show what power the new board really has over Altman and his outside pursuits, which include personal investments in numerous startups pursuing AI projects and a nuclear reactor maker. His day job and personal projects intermingling played some role in board members’ distrust, according to people involved in the situation but not authorized to discuss it. In 2019, while Altman was at the helm, OpenAI signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy $51 million of AI chips from Rain, a startup in which he has invested more than $1 million, WIRED reported last month. OpenAI hasn’t moved forward with a purchase. Felix says Altman is transparent with the board about his investments and follows a process for managing potential conflicts. Some sunlight on OpenAI’s governing documents could reveal whether it has made revisions to stabilize an unusual corporate structure and potentially pacify backers such as Microsoft. The company’s founding bylaws, publicly available via its 2016 application to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status, indicate how a fraction of the board could take control and push out Altman. OpenAI’s filings to the IRS through 2022 reported that no “significant changes” had ever been made to its governing documents. But the company almost certainly made updates after Altman’s return to allow it to give a nonvoting seat on the nonprofit board to Microsoft, whose CEO, Satya Nadella, complained publicly that he had been blindsided by Altman’s firing. Any additional changes made at that time remain a secret.

Their denial and new policy of withholding those documents extends an existing trend of dwindling openness at a project founded on transparency. OpenAI once published extensive detail about its AI inventions but has more recently guarded the technical details and data behind its most famous tool, ChatGPT. Felix, the company spokesperson, says San Francisco-based OpenAI discloses all the material required by the IRS and California’s attorney general and that it regularly publishes information about its research and safety work, while also making its research freely available in the form of tools such as ChatGPT. OpenAI’s declining openness has been most notable since 2019, when the nonprofit created a for-profit subsidiary to house most of its AI development and draw outside investment. That opened the way for OpenAI to hitch its future to the largesse of Microsoft, one of the tech giants it was founded to challenge, and also to shroud its finances. OpenAI cofounder turned competitor Elon Musk said at a New York Times event in November that his former company should be called Super-Closed-Source-for-Maxiumum-Profit-AI. Closely Held OpenAI’s original nonprofit organization—and its board—retain ultimate control of OpenAI’s activities and technology. Like all US nonprofits, it must publicly share upon request a copy of its annual report to the IRS and indicate in those submissions whether any additional documents like its bylaws or similar or related documents such as a governing constitution or conflict of interest policy were also available to the public during the last year. Some notable nonprofits do that, like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which publishes its bylaws and rules on conflicts and workplace relationships, but it’s not standard practice. “It is not common for organizations to make their governing documents or internal policies public,” says Rick Cohen, chief operating and communications officer for National Council of Nonprofits, an advocacy group.

Yet for seven consecutive years, from its founding through 2022, OpenAI stated in its annual IRS filings that it made those submissions as well as other files available “upon request.” It’s unclear if anyone ever took OpenAI up on the invitation in the years through 2022—OpenAI won’t say. Last month, after two days of waiting on OpenAI communications staff to fulfill an emailed request for its governing documents, conflict rules, and financial statements, WIRED rang the doorbell outside OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters on December 14 asking to see all those documents. A receptionist said over an intercom that wouldn’t be possible, hung up, and didn’t reengage. OpenAI’s IRS filing for 2023 that would reflect it has changed its previous policy isn’t due until later this year. To encourage oversight of nonprofits, US tax law requires them to at least make their annual reports to the IRS, form 990s, available for public inspection at their offices the same day they were requested if they are not posted on an organization’s website. OpenAI doesn’t post its reports on its website but still didn’t provide them when WIRED showed up in person. IRS documentation says violators can face fines of $20 a day, up to $10,000, but the agency declined to comment about OpenAI, citing confidentiality provisions of tax law. OpenAI hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, and Felix says OpenAI’s reports are available online through government and research databases.

Sunshine Dividends The financial statement OpenAI shared in response to WIRED’s request excludes the results of OpenAI’s “affiliated entities,” most crucially the for-profit unit that sells ChatGPT and other services, citing a desire to protect trade secrets. The statement, which covers 2022, shows just $44,000 in revenue and $1.3 million in expenses. That’s accurate for the nonprofit, but OpenAI overall reportedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars in sales last year and spends even more on high-end computers and top-flight researchers. Investors in OpenAI’s for-profit arm and employees of the company likely have access to some of the records the company now declines to share publicly, though they are bound by nondisclosure agreements covering internal files. Because OpenAI’s nonprofit takes in virtually no public support, it lacks the incentive that some nonprofits have to be more transparent so as to loosen the purse strings of donor or grant makers. OpenAI might win more loyalty from its customers or trust from regulators by opening up, but Altman has said the company didn’t lose any clients during its two weeks of high drama and generally has been greeted warmly by political leaders. The company may feel that the ongoing board review into OpenAI’s governance and what is shared from its findings will be enough. Without a reversal in OpenAI’s policy and a follow-through on its promises, so much about an increasingly influential organization may never become publicly known, like whether the new board amends the conflict-of-interest policy to better wrangle Altman and other executives. Back in 2022, it may have been possible to get the answer with just the ring of a doorbell.",

Let’s just try to learn from it. It’s popular in the AI space to claim altruism and openness; OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI (the new Musk one) all have a funky governance structure because they want to be a public good. The challenge is once any of these (or others) start to gain enough traction that they are seen as having a good chance at reaping billions in profits things change. And it’s not just AI companies and this isn’t new. This is art of human nature and will always be. We should be putting more emphasis and attention on truly open AI models (open training data, training source code & hyperparameters, model source code, weights) so the benefits of AI accrue to the public and not just a few companies.

People are not interchangeable. Most employees may have bills to pay, and will follow the money. The ones that matter most would have different motivation. Of course, of your sole goal is to create a husk that milks the achievement of the original team as long as it lasts and nothing else — sure, you can do that. But the \"organizational desires\" are still desires of people in the organization. And if those people are the ducks that lay the golden eggs, it might not be the smartest move to ignore them to prioritize the desires of the market for those eggs.

Blaming \"human nature\" is an excuse that is popular among egomaniacs, but on even brief inspection it is transparently thin: Human nature includes plenty of non-profits and people who did great things for humanity for little or no gain (scientists, soldiers, public servants, even some sofware developers). It also includes people who have done horrible things. Human nature really is that we have a choice. It's both a very old and fundamental part of human nature: And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. That's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, of course (Genesis 3). We know good and evil, we make our own choices; no blaming God or some outside force.

For an example, look at short form video, which started with Vine, was perfected by TikTok, and is now being hamfisted into Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube despite not really making any sense in those contexts.

Does anyone know if the Center of AI Safety acting for the public good and is this on their radar? reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agoparent> wondering if this situation is alarming enough to warrant an inquiry of some kind to determine whats going on behind the scenes OpenAI is making people rich and America look good, all while not doing anything obviously harmful to the public interest. They’re not a juicy target for anyone in the public sphere. If any one of those changes, OpenAI and possibly its leadership are in extremely hot water with the authorities. reply trinsic2 12 hours agorootparent> all while not doing anything obviously harmful to the public interest. Yeah, gonna have to challenge that: 1. We don't really if what they are doing is harming public interest, because we dont have access to much information about whats happening behind the scenes. 2. And there is enough information about this tech that leads to the possibility of it causing systemic damage to society if its not correctly controlled. reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agorootparent> We don't really if what they are doing is harming public interest That’s potentially harmful. > is enough information about this tech that leads to the possibility of it causing systemic damage Far from established. Hypothetically harmful. Obvious harm would need to be present and provable. (Otherwise, it’s a political question.) reply cj 10 hours agorootparentYou could say the same thing about a hypertargeted ad platform optimized for political use cases (Cambridge analytica) before they were outed. I think the point is it would be good to investigate future hypothetical harm before it becomes present and provable, at which point it’s too late. reply JumpCrisscross 5 hours agorootparent> it would be good to investigate future hypothetical harm Sure. That’s why we have the fourth estate. We don’t have anything close to what it would take to launch inquiries. reply danielmarkbruce 12 hours agorootparentprevYou don't have access because you aren't supposed to. Nothing about the founding, laws or customs of the US suggest that you (nor the government itself) have access to information about other people/companies any time you/they feel like \"finding out what's happening behind the scenes\". As for \"too important to privatize\"... practically all the important work in the world is done by private companies. It wasn't the government who just created vaccines for Covid. It isn't the government producing weapons for defense. It's not Joe B producing houses or electricity or cars or planes. That's not to say the government doesn't do anything but the idea that the dividing line for government work is \"super important work\" is wildly wrong and it's much closer to the inverse. reply diggan 10 hours agorootparent> Nothing about the founding, laws or customs of the US suggest that you (nor the government itself) have access to information about other people/companies any time you/they feel like \"finding out what's happening behind the scenes\". Isn't there entire processes about \"We suspect they doing something illegal behind the scenes so lets go and check\"? Isn't that what search warrants for example is all about? Or senate/congress inquiry or whatever they're called? reply danielmarkbruce 9 hours agorootparentWhen someone is suspected (with some amount of evidence) of doing something illegal, sure. With respect to inquries - if congressman X asks Sam Altman for the details of an algorithm at a congressional hearing, he is not obliged to answer. He can get his lawyer and argue the case - this happens and cases go to the supreme court to decide whether the question is in scope of the powers granted to congress under the consitution. The question has to be directly applicable to one of the responsibilities of congress, which are enumerated in the constitution. In practice redacted documents, limiting of question scope etc are discussed and worked around. Also in practice it's a bit of a political circus where most questions are for show rather than substance and you'll not really see them ask questions that would result in confidential information been given. reply romwell 11 hours agorootparentprev>practically all the important work in the world is done by private companies LOL, another one thinks the US is the entire world. reply danielmarkbruce 11 hours agorootparentThe comment about access is related to a US company. The relevant legal jurisdiction and framework is the US. If it were a French company, the relevant jurisdiction would be... France. You may not realize this, but OpenAI is a US company. The comment about all the important work in the world being done by private companies was indeed a global comment. You may not realize this, but covid vaccines were made by astrazeneca (UK), BioNTech (Germany), several US companies and others. Defense companies are located in every major economy. Most countries have power systems which are privately owned. Commercial planes are mostly built by one large French company and one large US company. All the large producers of cars around the world are private companies - big ones exist in the US, Japan, various European countries, Korea and China. reply romwell 1 hour agorootparentIt looks like you have a problem understanding the meaning of the word \"all\".

The press is absolutely addicted to blame, and any nuance that gets in between blame and the headline is relegated to the bottom of the article, far after the pay-wall. Oh well - I’m sure in a few more years this sort of tactic will be applied to Altman as well.

It says they launched OpenAI to be transparent but now it isn't. Maybe your \"they\" is ambiguous, does it refer to OpenAI or wealthy entrepreneurs including Musk? In the article the they isn't ambiguous, but it says something different overall: >Wealthy tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk launched OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab that they said would involve society and the public in the development of powerful AI, unlike Google and other giant tech companies working behind closed doors. In line with that spirit, OpenAI’s reports to US tax authorities have from its founding said that any member of the public can review copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules. They refers to the entrepreneurs, but it says they said OpenAI would be transparent. In your rewording they presumably refers to the entrepreneurs, but now you make it sound like it says the entrepreneurs now aren't transparent, rather than OpenAI. reply LudwigNagasena 10 hours agorootparentIt doesn't say it directly, but it would be a reasonable reading.

What's needed is closer to a government agency like NASA, with multiple independent inspectors like IAEA empowered by law to establish guardrails, report to congress, and pump the brakes if needed. Think Gibson's \"Turing Agency.\" They could mandate open sourcing the technology that is developed, maintain feedback channels with private and public enterprises, and provide the basis for sensible use of narrow AI while we collectively fund sensible safety, cognition, consciousness, and AGI research. If we woke up tomorrow to aliens visiting us from a distant galaxy, and one alien was 100 times more intelligent and capable than the average human, we would be confronted with something terrifying. Stuart Russell likens AI to such an alien giving us a heads up that it's on the way, and we may be looking at several years to several decades before the alien/AI arrives. We have a chance to get our shit together sufficient to meet the challenges we may face - whether or not you believe AI could pose an existential threat, or that it could destabilize civilization in horrible ways, it's probably unarguably rational to establish institutions and frank discussions now, well before any potential crisis. Heck, it's not like we hold our governments to account for spending at the scale of NASA - even a few tens of billions is a drop in the bucket, and it could also be a federal jobs program, incentivizing careers and research in a crucial technology sector. Allowing self-regulated private sector corporations operating in the tech market to be the fundamental drivers of AI is probably a recipe for dystopian abuses. This will, regardless of intetions, lead to further corrosion of individual rights to free expression, privacy, intellectual property, and so on. Even if a majority of the negative impact isn't regulatory or \"official\" in nature, allowing these companies to impose cultural shifts on us is a terrible thing. Companies and corporations should be subject to humans, not infringe on human agency. Right now we have companies that are effectively outside the control of any individual human, even the most principled and respectable CEOs, because the legal rules we operate them by are not aligned with the well-being of society at large, but the group of people who have invested time and/or money in the legal construct. It's worked pretty well, but at the speed and scale of the modern Tech industry, it's very clear that our governmental and social institutions are not equipped to mitigate the harms. NASA and the space race are probably the most recent and successful analogy to the quest for AGI, so maybe that's a solution worth trying again. reply LudwigNagasena 10 hours agorootparentprevSo is IKEA. reply JohnFen 13 hours agorootparentprevWhich means nothing. reply colordrops 14 hours agoparentprevAre they still trying to appear this way and is anyone still fooled?

    "originLink": "https://www.fundingsimulator.com/",
    "originBody": "Hi HNWe built a tool to help founders understand how modern fundraising (with safes) works, and how much dilution you can expect when raising money.The project is open-source. The code is a mess right now, but it&#x27;ll get better I promise. You can also help with that.We didn&#x27;t build this to make money. We genuinely did it because we were looking for it, and couldn&#x27;t find it.We&#x27;re in fact in the process of fundraising for a company, and at first glance the process looks simple. Just an excel sheet will do! But then the more we dug into it and tried different simulators, the more we realized that it&#x27;s more complex than it looks.We even signed up to Pulley, Carta and others just to run simulations. But they&#x27;re a bit confusing.TL;DR: Understanding modern startup funding and knowing how much dilution you&#x27;ll face is hard. We built a tool that&#x27;ll hopefully help with that. You can add Post-money Safes, priced rounds and issue options to employees, and you can see how that affects your ownership at every step. You can also simulate an Exit scenario and see how much money you&#x27;ll be left with.---Some examples of complex stuff:- There are many different types of safes. They all convert at the first priced round, but in different ways. Some are through discount, some are uncapped, some have a fixed valuation cap, and some have both a discount and a valuation cap.- All safes (before first priced round) convert at the same time. They don&#x27;t dilute each other, which is what happens in the rest of fundraising.- Investors often require you to set aside some options. This one is particularily nasty. Basically, if an investor expects you to set aside 10% as options, and expects to get 10% equity, that&#x27;s what should appear in the subsequent cap table. However, calculating the options is difficult, and is often a circular calculation (even Kirsty Nathoo from YC says it&#x27;s complex and avoids showing the calculation in the Safe video \"Understanding SAFEs and Priced Equity Rounds\")- Safes and priced rounds can have pro-rata, but don&#x27;t always exercise it- Pro-ratas of safes are taken from the priced round money, so you&#x27;d expect the safe holder&#x27;s equity to remain the same if they exercise it. BUT ... it gets diluted by the new options issued.- Safes can have an MFN provision, which defers the valuation discussion&#x2F;calculation until the moment the priced round is about to close. With a mix of discounts, uncapped and valuation caps, it gets tricky to know which deal is \"better\".- ...Assumptions and limitations:- Only post-money safes and priced rounds.- No down rounds. There&#x27;s a bit more complexity around liquidation preferences and anti-dilution rights - we don&#x27;t support that now. It only matters if you&#x27;re simulating a \"bad\" situation. But come on, it&#x27;s a simulator — Be optimistic.- No pro-rata caps. We might add that soon, to fully support the YC standard deal. But for now, if an investor gets a pro-rata, they can exercise either all of it (keeping their original ownership) or none.- Safes&#x27; pro-ratas disappear after the first priced round. (I think this is what happens normally?)- Remaining available options get redistributed evenly at exit.- The round is the investor. For the sake of simplicity, consider \"Series A\" as the combination of all series A investors into one, super-investor.Let us know what you think!",

The project is open-source. The code is a mess right now, but it'll get better I promise. You can also help with that. We didn't build this to make money. We genuinely did it because we were looking for it, and couldn't find it. We're in fact in the process of fundraising for a company, and at first glance the process looks simple. Just an excel sheet will do! But then the more we dug into it and tried different simulators, the more we realized that it's more complex than it looks. We even signed up to Pulley, Carta and others just to run simulations. But they're a bit confusing. TL;DR: Understanding modern startup funding and knowing how much dilution you'll face is hard. We built a tool that'll hopefully help with that. You can add Post-money Safes, priced rounds and issue options to employees, and you can see how that affects your ownership at every step. You can also simulate an Exit scenario and see how much money you'll be left with. --- Some examples of complex stuff: - There are many different types of safes. They all convert at the first priced round, but in different ways. Some are through discount, some are uncapped, some have a fixed valuation cap, and some have both a discount and a valuation cap. - All safes (before first priced round) convert at the same time. They don't dilute each other, which is what happens in the rest of fundraising. - Investors often require you to set aside some options. This one is particularily nasty. Basically, if an investor expects you to set aside 10% as options, and expects to get 10% equity, that's what should appear in the subsequent cap table. However, calculating the options is difficult, and is often a circular calculation (even Kirsty Nathoo from YC says it's complex and avoids showing the calculation in the Safe video \"Understanding SAFEs and Priced Equity Rounds\") - Safes and priced rounds can have pro-rata, but don't always exercise it - Pro-ratas of safes are taken from the priced round money, so you'd expect the safe holder's equity to remain the same if they exercise it. BUT ... it gets diluted by the new options issued. - Safes can have an MFN provision, which defers the valuation discussion/calculation until the moment the priced round is about to close. With a mix of discounts, uncapped and valuation caps, it gets tricky to know which deal is \"better\". - ... Assumptions and limitations: - Only post-money safes and priced rounds. - No down rounds. There's a bit more complexity around liquidation preferences and anti-dilution rights - we don't support that now. It only matters if you're simulating a \"bad\" situation. But come on, it's a simulator — Be optimistic. - No pro-rata caps. We might add that soon, to fully support the YC standard deal. But for now, if an investor gets a pro-rata, they can exercise either all of it (keeping their original ownership) or none. - Safes' pro-ratas disappear after the first priced round. (I think this is what happens normally?) - Remaining available options get redistributed evenly at exit. - The round is the investor. For the sake of simplicity, consider \"Series A\" as the combination of all series A investors into one, super-investor. Let us know what you think! pgt 1 hour agoThe Plus button looks like it will add another founder. Couldn't figure out how to get to next step for a while, adding & removing founders. Consider just showing the possible actions right there, not having to click on the buttons. Also, on landing page, just go straight into the New Startup screen so you don't have to click \"New Startup\" since there is no other option when you have none listed. Was looking for a \"Run Simulation\" button, but it was not at all obvious that I should hover over the blocks added to see the \"output\". Just show the output on-screen :). reply Draiken 15 hours agoprevI'd love more help bubbles, since I'm not familiar with a ton of these toggles and boxes. I'd also love to see how much employees would get, not just me. I know people generally care more about themselves, but seeing how it would work if you gave a lot more to employees would be great. reply mlhpdx 12 hours agoparentAgreed. Adding the employee point of view would make this tool an excellent education piece. It’s always a struggle to explain. reply leetrout 5 hours agorootparentOr, no snark, open their eyes to how little their options are worth. reply dmurray 1 hour agorootparentAre there any companies that share with the employees enough information to run this simulator? My standard experience has been -\"This offer includes X,000 share/option units\" -\"great, how much is that worth in dollars?\" -\"well, we can't tell you, but there are Y00,000 shares in total, and the last investor paid $Z million for W% of the company\". \"OK, that's very useful. If I assume my shares are as good as the investor's shares, I can estimate my shares' market value. Did the investor get anything else of economic value for his investment? A liquidation preference? Right to invest in future rounds? A board seat? Sweetheart deals with his favourite companies? \" - \"Let me check that with Finance\"... ... ... \"I'm sorry but I can't tell you that\" - \"OK, I understand that's confidential. Can I at least get the same deal as him? I'll trust you to give me my extra benefits when they accrue, and I waive the board seat and the backhand deals\" - \"Absolutely not.\" - \"Well then, it's very hard for me to put a value on these shares/ options. Even though I'm willing to take some level of risk in my compensation, and value these close to market value, you won't give me enough information to let me value them at anything other than $0\" - \"I've checked with $BIGWIG and actually we can make an exception in this case: we can offer you (X + 1),000 shares/ options. How does that sound? \" - \"...\" reply mdekkers 4 hours agorootparentprevI never count options as renumeration. Startups and scaleups may as well promise to pay me with lottery tickets. Cash please, thank you. If you want to talk about using equity to pay me, please come with real shares, and a say in how the business is run, at least in the areas where I have experience and expertise. reply amne 9 minutes agorootparentYou only accept equity as the only pay if you believe in your friend's product and can take the hit when it doesn't work out. Everywhere else I've seen actual cash + options which is a way of saying \"we'll pay you for a while and if this works out your options will be your reward for sticking around\". reply jacquesm 15 hours agoprevVery nice work, this will help to play through different scenarios. It might be worth it to show that different industries have very different up front capital requirements and that for instance a template for doing a hardware startup has rough indications of how much of the total funding is required at which stage of the venture. This is where I see a lot of people make - very costly - mistakes in terms of dilution, they start a hardware startup or some other capital intensive track but use SaaS levels of capital requirement and timing to plan their liquidity. This obviously can impact the business in very negative ways (or can even cause it to go under). So to inject some realism into the figures at various phases using templates might be a useful thing. Another thing you may want to consider is to put sweat equity and funds supplied by the founders in there, as well as a way to administer friends-and-family rounds, and to be able to play through a founder departing scenario. I realize those are complex things to do, and obviously you're under no obligation to do any of this. Thank you for making this and for putting it out there. reply mikikian 14 hours agoprevGreat work! It would be cool if there was an option to \"Exit / Sell the Startup\" after a SAFE round i.e., before a priced round.

A graph of sale price vs your take would be really helpful for this since it’s nonlinear. UI suggestion: allow click-drag on percentage boxes. I was tweaking percentages between 4 founders in order to come up with certain amounts post-round and it was a bit trial and error. On mobile it would have been tons easier if I could just nudge the values up and down rather than having to type them all in again. reply echelon 13 hours agorootparentprevCould you show hypothetical dilution at the SAFE level too? And continue to show it on the graph edges after a priced round? It'd also be cool to see hypothetical valuation of equity on the line/edges too. This is an awesome tool, btw! Thank you for putting it together! reply Luctia 10 hours agoprevNice tool, but if your goal is to help people understand, some more information in the UI would be nice; I can click \"add safe\" - what does that mean? reply XCSme 7 hours agoparentI don't know any funding terms, so the UI is very confusing for me. I don't understand what Val(post) is, what 10% options actually means (who gets the options?) what \"Other pro-rata\" means, etc. reply rrr_oh_man 9 hours agoparentprevSAFE: Simple Agreement for Future Equity TL;DR: A really simple funding contract.

As an emerging company lawyer, this is something we do constantly, albeit in excel form or through conversations with founders.

It truly gets complicated, especially when at later stage you start getting venture debt (not safes), more demanding LiqPref and you’re facing an exit at a price which is not ideal.

This is really nice for getting a quick ball-park idea on strategy or getting up and running on the early-side. This is MUCH cleaner/nicer than e.g. Carta's simulation tool.

Would be awesome if you could assign time intervals to the vertical lines connecting events, and then at the end you could show the IRR and multiple on invested capital for each participant (except where that doesn't make sense, like for employees). Would also be nice if it had reasonable assumptions for fixed costs such as lawyer fees for each round, or investment banking fees for the exit sale. reply mikewarot 12 hours agoprevI don't have a clue what a \"safe\" is... but I made 36 million dollars in 3 steps. I'm a happy camper. reply tptacek 12 hours agoparentIt's a standardized convertible note instrument, designed to replace convertible debt. Convertible notes are what you raise in a widely syndicated round before you have a firm valuation (ie, in your seed round). It's very easy to \"sell\" someone a convertible note, whereas an institutional priced round involves huge amounts of due diligence and legal fees. Convertible debt became the sort of default way seed rounds worked, but because they're technically debt they have maturity dates, which are logistical problems for founders; SAFE's just convert into equity directly. Broadly syndicated convertible note seed rounds are a relatively new innovation; what preceded them was \"friends and family\" rounds of $50-100k followed immediately by an A round, which was a galactic pain in the ass for founders trying to get their companies up on their legs. A seed lets you confirm your hypothesis about PMF without doing board meetings. The C.W. is that seed rounds today, no matter who's doing them, are done with SAFEs. reply latchkey 7 hours agorootparentGreat explanation, also link to the documents: https://www.ycombinator.com/documents reply iamandoni 13 hours agoprevWow what a great tool!

Maybe there can be a way to set how the market responds and see how that directly impacts your net worth as a founder. reply teaearlgraycold 15 hours agoprevLooks great! Personally I’d make it so state changes don’t push history into the stack. Users don’t consider those inputs comparable to a page change. It’s more like typing into a form. reply zikero 15 hours agoparentwanted to make any simulation shareable by copying the url. but you're right, there has to be a better way ... reply methodical 13 hours agorootparentAs somebody else suggested just a share link would be a good way to allow sharing. Alternatively, for either a share link or as just a way to keep the state in the URL, I'd recommend B64 encoding the data as opposed to just directly escaping it. URLs have a maximum length (forgot off the top of my head, may be 1024 or something), so storing large stringified objects usually results in issues as opposed to just encoding it. It also makes for a more logical URL structure of fundingsimulator.com/{b64}. This is if you wanted to keep the URL as the single source of truth on the state, otherwise you could keep state internally which can be initialized by optional URL state (structured as stated before), and then just encode it and put it in a URL which is copied to clipboard when a share button is clicked. reply s4i 14 hours agorootparentprevhistory.replaceState (instead of history.pushState) is your friend. reply teaearlgraycold 15 hours agorootparentprevShare link in the corner is the way. Or just do a “replace” instead of “push” (using NextJS terminology) reply Aeolun 9 hours agoprevI’m a bit put out that this implies the only way for a startup to end is by selling out.

This could have been a game changer for me! Keeps us updated with you work pls Ready to provide dev assistance reply jacobsenscott 9 hours agoparentThe complications are intentional. It doesn't need to be this way, but the job of a VC is to screw workers out of as much money as possible, as quickly as possible. Complex deals are one tool in the toolbox. reply nahsra 7 hours agorootparentThis was certainly true in the past from my understanding of the history before my time. Most terms are pretty standard now. And most of them have good reasons for existing — usually to align the founders and investors. Just because a term is complex and could benefit the investor doesn’t mean it’s meant to mislead. But, I’m interested in some examples that might shake my opinion about up! reply parkaboy 15 hours agoprevI'm not sure if this feature request makes sense: also enabling having an option pool created at the SAFE round. I've had a situation where a lead investor requested an option pool created as part of a pre-seed round on SAFEs. reply zikero 15 hours agoparentthanks for the suggestion! we had the same thing happen as well. although it's not very standard I think in the case of safes. a dirty way now would be to do \"Resere/give options\" before the safe. reply parkaboy 15 hours agorootparentSomething like that would be awesome, thanks. reply nilsbunger 12 hours agoprevLove the UI.

I don’t understand why people are so quick to start giving up control out of the gate for software companies. Servers are cheap, it’s not like in say, manufacturing where you need a factory. You’re gonna let some VC bro tell you what to do for a SaaS product? Why exactly? Just go to market on the cheap. I’ve had every quarter profitable since founding, and never taken a dime in VC. I’m not going to be a billionaire, but that’s fine, I want to chart my own path. reply primitivesuave 14 hours agoparentBootstrapping requires a rare breed of founder who is financially secure enough (or frugal enough) to manage life on a reduced salary, capable of building useful products on a budget, and willing to risk the missed opportunity cost of a cushy Big Co position. In my experience, the hardest thing to master is the actual building - plenty of people are bootstrapping \"theoretically useful\" inventions in basements/garages/etc, that don't solve actual problems. Such people can really benefit from VC oversight and business acumen. reply mlhpdx 12 hours agorootparentI don’t know that it’s really that rare. I look around and I see people with the fiscal responsibility, knowledge and ability to get things done in every quarter. reply danjac 9 minutes agorootparentDepends on your circle.

Would it not be financially more prudent to hire/consult experts, particularly if you can get access to a startup/accelerator program? Even without easy access, there is no dilution of ownership. reply jimnotgym 13 hours agorootparentIt is not easy to hire/consult that level of person though. They are too busy being VCs reply user_7832 12 hours agorootparentThank you, that makes sense. reply codegeek 15 hours agoparentprevI run a bootstrapped business and I hear you. However, VC Funding can make sense for certain cases. I do think that too many people raise VC prematurely. The best path in my opinion is: 0-PMF/100 customers: Bootstrap it PMF-Scale: VC Fund if you can show 100% growth each year and forward. If the market is big enough (TAM etc), This can become a billion dollar company and for this to happen fast enough, you will need funding. Also, the reason you need funding here is because it is very tough to scale a business slowly. Either you grow fast from here or die/stay average growth. Again, like you said, nothing wrong with \"chart my own path\" but VC funding has its needs. It's just that most people try to raise funding way too early and hence cannot keep up with the growth requirements and eventually either die or sell/pivot for peanuts. reply user_7832 13 hours agorootparent> PMF-Scale: VC Fund if you can show 100% growth each year and forward.

Also, the reason you need funding here is because it is very tough to scale a business slowly. Either you grow fast from here or die/stay average growth. This makes sense, but I wonder how truly \"necessary\" funding is. I understand that funding very (relatively) quickly can help turn a \"eating ramen for dinner\" salary to a a-regular-job levels of salary which is very good. But is there a business risk to grow \"organically\"/through word of mouth? Assuming it is possible to grow the company only working part time (which is admittedly a very big assumption), bootstrapping sounds slightly better. > It's just that most people try to raise funding way too early and hence cannot keep up with the growth requirements and eventually either die or sell/pivot for peanuts. Thanks, that's insightful! reply romanhn 13 hours agorootparentThe business risk is that another company with more money and therefore resources will see your PMF and will move faster to capture the market. reply user_7832 12 hours agorootparentThanks, that makes sense. I would imagine patents could help somewhat but from what I've learnt they're not cheap and can still only help so much. reply codegeek 12 hours agorootparentprevThe thing with Funding is that you shouldn't really need it but it's more of a fuel when there already is fire (aka PMF). Once you have the fire (most people fail to get to this point anyway), then you decide if fueling that fire with VC dollars make sense or not for your goals. The problem is that lot of entrepreneur need funding to even start because they don't have enough resources to start something (may be they need cash, people etc). But VC dont fund because you need cash. They fund because you are able to convince them somehow that you are building a unicorn. reply user_7832 12 hours agorootparentThank you, that makes sense. Btw is PMF = product market fit in this context? > They fund because you are able to convince them somehow that you are building a unicorn. I'm admittedly very naïve about this, but do they really expect this all the time? (Especially in physical and non-digital markets?) If you have a healthy growth and projection but no plans to say exceed 100M are you limited by how many VCs are interested? reply romanhn 11 hours agorootparentThe big VCs typically will expect extreme growth, because the big wins are needed to make up for the losses they will incur on many of the their other portfolio companies. That said, there are smaller VCs and private equity firms who will be happy to fund companies with lesser aspirations. Just don't expect comparably big valuations and you'll likely need to cede more control for less money. reply user_7832 9 hours agorootparentThanks! reply codegeek 11 hours agorootparentprev\"do they really expect this all the time\" This is an interesting question. I don't know if they believe but they def want to believe because without unicorns, they won't survive as most startups fail or have mediocre returns which is not enough for VCs to justify to their own investors/LPs. reply user_7832 9 hours agorootparentThank you, that makes sense. reply jacquesm 15 hours agoparentprevIt works as long as you don't have funded competition. Especially if they start giving away the thing that you charge for. Then you need to have deep pockets to wait it out. reply sjwhevvvvvsj 15 hours agorootparentTherein lies the rub, but if you are turning a small, but real profit, and you then need a cash infusion you’ll retain far more control if you already have proved you can make money. reply jacquesm 14 hours agorootparentBeen there, done that and no, you're wrong. You won't find any investors if there is already a very well funded competitor that gives away the same product. They will spoil both the market and your funding chances.

It happened to our guests and happened to our people.\" Alaska Airlines CEO says ‘many’ loose bolts found on grounded planes 02:58 Get more newson Print Save Create your free profile or log in to save this article Jan. 23, 2024, 8:44 PM UTC / Updated Jan. 24, 2024, 12:41 AM UTC By Tom Costello and Rob Wile The CEO of Alaska Airlines said new, in-house inspections of the carrier's Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in the wake of a near-disaster earlier this month revealed that “many” of the aircraft were found to have loose bolts. In an exclusive interview with NBC News senior correspondent Tom Costello, Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci discussed the findings of his company's inspections so far since the Jan. 5 incident, in which a panel on one of its Max 9 jets blew out midair on a flight carrying 177 people. “I’m more than frustrated and disappointed,” he said. “I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people. And — my demand on Boeing is what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house.” Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci speaks in an exclusive interview with NBC News senior correspondent Tom Costello.NBC News Following the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all Boeing Max 9 planes grounded and launched a safety investigation. The agency also announced an audit of Boeing's Max 9 production line and suppliers \"to evaluate Boeing’s compliance with its approved quality procedures.\" It is also subjecting Boeing, as well as its third-party suppliers, to additional increased monitoring. The incident also prompted lawmakers to question whether Boeing's quality control systems are adequate. “Given the previous tragic crashes of Boeing 737 Max aircraft, we are deeply concerned that the loose bolts represent a systemic issue with Boeing’s capabilities to manufacture safe airplanes,” Sens. Ed Markey, J.D. Vance and Peter Welch wrote to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this month. There is still no timetable for returning the Boeing-made planes to service because the FAA has not yet issued specific maintenance orders that are required for them to do so. NBC News senior correspondent Tom Costello interviews Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci. NBC News As a result, Alaska Airlines, whose fleet had the highest percentage of Max 9 planes among any major carrier, has spent weeks canceling and rearranging its schedule, leaving thousands of passengers scrambling. Minicucci said the onus is now on Boeing to show how it will improve its quality control and prevent such incidents from unfolding in the future. But out of an abundance of caution, he said, Alaska Airlines is incorporating its own additional oversight on the production line at Boeing. \"We’re sending our audit people to audit their quality control systems and processes to make sure that every aircraft that comes off that production line, that comes to Alaska has the highest levels of excellence and quality,\" he said. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said in a separate interview with CNBC on Wednesday that it is now contemplating a future for its fleet without the Boeing 737 Max 10, a newer version of the popular jet. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said the company will send its own audit staff to perform pre-delivery inspections of its planes at Boeing.NBC News United has also said that it found additional loose bolts on its Max 9 planes. Minicucci told NBC's Costello that while Alaska Airlines \"was\" planning to buy Max 10s, the company will now evaluate \"what the best long-term strategic plan is for Alaska('s) fleet mix\" once the craft is certified. \"I think everything’s open at this point ... for us,\" he said, confirming that Hawaiian Airlines, which Alaska Airlines is in the process of buying, uses planes produced by Boeing's rival, Airbus. \"I think we’re going to do what’s best for Alaska long term, in terms of fleet mix for us. It gives us optionality.\" In a statement to NBC News, Boeing said: “We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.” FAA urging inspection of another Boeing plane model Jan. 23, 202401:12 Boeing has lost 19% of its market capitalization over the past month. Minicucci, who became president of Alaska Airlines in 2016 and began his career as an engineer, said he was \"incredulous\" that something like the incident earlier this month could even happen. \"I knew that this was an issue out of the (Boeing) factory,\" he said. \"There was no question in my mind.\" \"And it’s clear to me that we received an airplane from Boeing with a faulty door. Now the NTSB investigation is going to figure out why that was a faulty door, whether it was bad installation, missing hardware, a manufacturing issue, but there’s no doubt that Alaska received an airplane off the production line with a faulty door,\" Minicucci said, referring to the National Transportation Safety Board's probe.

This seems crazy to me. Alaska Airlines doesn't trust Boeing enough that they're sending their audit team to Boeing to check for quality. Though safety inspections were initially estimated to take between four and eight hours per plane, Whitaker said they’ve “been longer than that.” “We’ve required a lot of measurements,” he said. “Once the area’s exposed, we want to understand bolt tensions and gaps and things of that nature. So we’ve required more data than would normally be the case because we really wanted to understand the issue.” Also, the FAA is at Boeing checking their quality process. They're only doing it for the door and bolts. The problem is that we don't know which other parts and systems Boeing might have quality issues for. Yes, I'm confident they'll make the bolts tighter on the door. But what about the entire plane's quality check? I feel like the FAA should ground the plane until they audit every single thing about the plane. That's the only way I would personally feel confident. reply pixelesque 20 hours agoparentThis apparent anonymous comment from a Boeing employee about the number of issues happening in their qaulity system is a bit worrying: https://leehamnews.com/2024/01/15/unplanned-removal-installa... reply kloch 19 hours agorootparent> So, where are the bolts? Probably sitting forgotten and unlabeled (because there is no formal record number to label them with) on a work-in-progress bench, unless someone already tossed them in the scrap bin to tidy up.

Merely as qualified as Boeing which is a fairly low bar apparently. reply dylan604 18 hours agorootparentprevThis seems very funny/strange to me. Way back in the early/mid-90s, the company I worked for invested a lot of money to switch to some new computer accounting/inventory system that ran on AS400 (just to show its age). The software was originally built to track all of the parts and pieces to build an airplane. What type of airplane I don't know, but we made VHS tapes so the level of complexity between and airplane and VHS cassette always seems to be out of whack. After that, I just assumed all airplane manufactures used something like this. reply FredPret 19 hours agorootparentprevThat comment thread is wild. Do you think it is genuine? If what that commenter says is true, the whole company ought to be shut down. It’d also be an easy sell for either of the two presidential candidates - one can say he’s clamping down on incompetent elites who aren’t that elite after all; the other can talk about a profit-seeking company killing Americans. reply TimPC 18 hours agorootparentI think the cracking down on incompetent elites that aren't that elite is something Republicans feel should be left to the market to decide. I don't think it's an easy sell to argue the government should shut down an entire company over issues rather than letting the issues lead to fewer sales and having the market sort it out. I think most Republicans would vehemently disagree with a statement like \"the government should decide who the elites are\", which this action seems to be doing. I agree the profit-seeking company killing Americans is an easy sell with democrats and possibly even a good chunk of independents. reply dotBen 16 hours agorootparentSure, but due to its nature the aircraft industry for commerical planes isn't really a free market. Obviously, Boeing and Airbus represent a duopoly. When you factor in one of them is US-based and is relied upon to deliver on certain national security projects, defense etc no politician is going to let the commercial arm fail and risk the national security arm failing too. Also there is a lag in the system around failure. The market could decide that Boeing planes are poorly constructed, but how many accidents and deaths would have to happen in order for customer (airlines) to decide to no longer put in orders. That's not really feasible. \"Too big to fail\" reply ciabattabread 18 hours agorootparentprevBoeing is also a major defense contractor, and has facilities spread out across many states. No politician of either party is going to call for the shutdown of a major employer of their constituents and a key component of national security. reply smegger001 16 hours agorootparentseems to me that you might want quality control on those defense/weapon systems. if the rot is this bad in one part of the company like as not it is just as bad on the govenrment contract side as well. reply zardo 15 hours agorootparentThe pressure to cut costs may be a little lower on the government contract side. reply bumby 11 hours agorootparentDepends on the contracting mechanism. If it's something like cost-plus, there is less pressure. But on fixed cost, it might be just as great. reply acdha 17 hours agorootparentprevThat’s true but it’s very easy to imagine at least one party being more than willing to have the FAA be less deferential. reply tough 17 hours agorootparentprevwhy don't they acquire Boeing into a government owned company (for the defense stuff) reply takinola 16 hours agorootparentThe US doesn't do government-owned (except in exceptional circumstances). For one, they would be sued by the shareholders (unfair seizure) and competitors (unfair competition). It also is not clear that the government acquiring something would make it run better. reply delfinom 16 hours agorootparentprev>If what that commenter says is true, the whole company ought to be shut down. No it won't. Boeing has reached too big to fail status. They employ many millions of people directly and indirectly between commercial and military aerospace. Boeing has reached PEAK too big to fail recently too when they announced that due to their too big to fail status, they are unable to estimate or control costs anymore and will no longer bid for any US military contracts that are fixed-price. What you will see is billions in bailout funds given to Boeing shareholders. reply hughesjj 13 hours agorootparentStill ought to be shut down though. Given they're outsourcing so much of their maintenance and shitting their bed on their existing products, at some point too big to fail just turns into a big failure. reply emeril 16 hours agorootparentprevit sounds genuine to me - perhaps it's worth it for him to be a whistleblower? reply huytersd 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s hard for both candidates. Boeing is our only airline manufacturer and an American institution. If it shuts down all we have is an European Airbus and creates an opening for a Chinese COMAC. reply FredPret 15 hours agorootparentDon't forget Canadian Bombardier! reply eitally 19 hours agorootparentprevI spent 15 years of my career working in contract manufacturing, building and managing engineering teams building manufacturing & quality systems. A lot of what our company did was for regulated industries (defense & medical). What's not surprising at all is that Boeing customers would have conducted independent audits of the materiel being delivered to them, either while the planes were on the line, or post-delivery. That's to be expected, as is periodic external audits by regulatory bodies. What's mildly more interesting, but still not surprising, is that Spirit was so consistently upset with finished product quality that they contracted with Boeing to have Spirit employees colo'd at Boeing shops to inspect and warranty repair their planes. This is also not remarkable in electronics contract manufacturing: very frequently there are OEM employee squads staffing QA & Repair/RMA benches at contract manufacturer factories, for two reasons. 1) The OEM knows their product better than the manufacturer, and 2) Risk. Ultimately the OEM is accountable for quality to the consumer, no matter who the constructor is. It mildly more interesting to learn that Spirit was not granted access to Boeing's MES, which leads me to believe that Boeing's stance toward Spirit is more like \"they're our customer and they insist on on-site inspection & repair so we'll begrudingly allow it\" than \"they're our customer and we have a shared interest in quality manufacturing so we'll partner with them to ensure that happens.\" This is a failure of leadership and extremely short-sighted, and is virtually guaranteed to result in the sort of process failures and outcomes the throwaway describes. It's not uncommon for OEMs to take over contract manufacturer's sites, either because of a strategic decision to conduct manufacturing operations internally [again], or due to persist or pernicious quality issues arising from specific partners' operations or at specific plants. This is relatively feasible in the case of most electronics and smaller mechanical devices, and contract manufacturers operate in a state of existential fear most of the time, knowing their destiny is in the hands of a small handful of OEM customers (just look at the impact Apple's quarterly reports and projections have on partners like Foxconn, Jabil and Pegatron). It's not practical -- or even really possible due to capital expense -- to do this in aerospace. For that reason primarily, I see no alternative than for Boeing (and others) to be forced into 100% process compliance by presence of permanent external audit teams based in corporate offices and every manufacturing & assembly location. I wouldn't be surprised, too, if Boeing were forced (for political rather than anything to do with quality) to onshore more of their supply chain[1]). [1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235197892... reply boolemancer 16 hours agorootparentMy impression was the the Spirit mentioned in the comment was Spirit AeroSystems, not Spirit Airlines, so the relationship between the two companies is the other way around; Boeing is the customer. reply JohnFen 14 hours agorootparentSpirit Aerosystems also used to be Boeing, but Boeing spun out that division years ago. I don't know, but it seems to me that history makes the relationship between the two more than just supplier/customer. reply jamestimmins 16 hours agorootparentprevAre there other sites for different industries with comment sections that are this good? The overall quality is incredibly high. reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, I see this attitude too often in the healthcare industry as well, often leading to recalls. It sounds like someone under pressure came up with a \"loophole\" that was compliant with a motivated but literal reading of the CMES reporting requirement. In this case, I would wager dollars to donuts that the CMES reporting requirement only anticipated door separated/not separated. Mental gymnastics is used to argue compliance with some technical requirement, like it is some legal proceeding where you can debate what the definition of \"is\" is. No amount of formal quality process can defend against business pressure and incentives to hack the same system. Requirements dont and cant cover every corner case, like someone saying a door was never fully separated because you tied them together with a shoelace before dethatching it. Asking if a justification passes the \"red face test\" is ultimately more valuable than asking if it passes a literal reading. reply antonchekhov 16 hours agorootparent> No amount of formal quality process can defend against business pressure and incentives to hack the same system. \"Culture eats Strategy for breakfast\" -- Peter Drucker (purportedly) reply bumby 20 hours agoparentprev>Alaska Airlines doesn't trust Boeing enough that they're sending their audit team to Boeing to check for quality.

Not so fine for spaceflight. reply im_down_w_otp 18 hours agorootparentYou're going to be very sad to discover the sentiments around software-intensive systems testing in a lot of places & industries that you'd rightfully assume should know better and do better. I had a safety critical embedded engineer who had worked on everything from weapons systems to automobiles first not have any idea what property-based testing was and then proceed to tell me at length how it was pointless because unit testing is all you need as long as you keep making your units smaller and smaller. At the time I worked in FinTech and was aghast at what I was hearing as they worked on self-driving. If I had to pin down what made me shift my career path into \"cyber-physical systems\", it was probably that conversation. Since making the transition and later founding a company dedicated to testing in that domain, I've heard dozens and dozens of sentiments even more concerning. reply JohnFen 18 hours agorootparent> and then proceed to tell me at length how it was pointless because unit testing is all you need as long as you keep making your units smaller and smaller. I've encountered devs that think this nonsense before, but always assumed that this attitude couldn't be held with systems that are actually critical. I'm a bit less naive now. reply shermantanktop 18 hours agorootparentI thought that too, early on. Sort of a perfect-bricks-make-perfect-walls idea. And when problems emerge at the integration stage, it’s often traceable to a gap that a lower-level test could have caught. So the mentality is a bit self-reinforcing. reply im_down_w_otp 17 hours agorootparentExactly. All the products we make are focused at the integration and system level because it's crystal clear that's where enormous amounts of issues arise and unbounded numbers of 11th hour fire drills occur. The various industries who've had multiple product cycles with lots of software are starting to figure this out, but it took awhile. Despite how obvious it is with a little outside observer perspective, the \"perfect bricks\" way of thinking is pervasive because that's how the builders and supply chains are organized. reply grumpyprole 11 hours agorootparentprevTaking that argument to the extreme, why test any new software at all when the underlying instructions have all been thoroughly tested! reply chernevik 17 hours agorootparentprevWhich is silly, because the whole point of integration testing is to show your bricks don't fit together as expected. reply boringg 19 hours agorootparentprevWhen lax QA testing / engineering practices / boost the share price strategies from move fast break stuff e-commerce/social media practices seep into real world systems companies. reply Zach_the_Lizard 18 hours agorootparentFrom an outsider's perspective, it seems \"move fast and break things\" worked well enough for SpaceX. Boeing et al seem to be following the \"move slow and hide problems so we don't fix anything\" mantra. reply bumby 18 hours agorootparent>\"move fast and break things\" worked well enough for SpaceX. Counterpoint: SpaceX had to re-learn well-known practices that are so commonplace in aerospace it's shocking they weren't being conducted [1]. One example is more complete material testing on critical components as part of supplier quality control. When they lost a rocket due to this process gap, their solution was to layer on those common QC practices. IMO these are risks that, over time, may turn SpaceX into the dinosaurs they are competing with. (reference to Chesterson's fence is probably apt.) \"Moving fast and breaking things\" may be fine, but to the GP's point, it has to be a risk-based decision. We probably shouldn't be aiming to move fast when lives are at risk. [1] https://spacenews.com/falcon-9-failure-linked-to-upper-stage... reply ABeeSea 18 hours agorootparentprev> Instead of simulating an entire mission from launch to docking, “the team decided they would rather run multiple tests with chunks of the mission,” Mullholland said. “Going forward, for every flight, we will do launch to docking and undocking to landing in addition to the other tests we were doing in our qualification testing.” Given the amount of money and lives at risk, this level of process short-cutting is mind boggling. reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentI suspect this is a result of schedule pressure.

They had an error in one of the redundant automatic controllers for pressurization. That controller isn’t even required equipment. Airplanes fly around ALL THE TIME with equipment that isn’t working.

Or they could be just putting on a show like you're suggesting, but that would do a huge disservice from a PR perspective if that results in the underlying issues not being fixed. \"Door fell off airplane during flight\" headlines a couple times a month would be some of the worst PR you could possibly have (with the exception of planes crashing, obviously even worse) reply jpalawaga 18 hours agorootparentprevI don't agree.

Maybe Alaska does really care, but I must confess my first thought was also \"cagey PR move.\" I've seen many products and services clearly making their products worse in order to make more money. Airlines have done similar things with passenger space and various fees, it's not so hard to imagine them cutting corners only to be surprised that they've gone too far and inadvertently impacted airplane safety.

The person(s) who failed to tighten bolts could easily have been doing exactly the right thing, for instance if training and documentation were screwed up. Boeing in general seems to have a serious culture problem that we should condemn, but it’s not like the “they” that set cultural norms is the same “they” that’s out there on a supplier’s factory floor with a torque wrench.

One of the few real bright spots is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Air which works on a fundamentally different model from other airlines (limited network, fewer flights per week.) It is getting harder and harder to see the difference between traditional airliners like Delta and \"low cost\" airlines like Southwest. People do compare prices on competitive routes. Airlines, in the US at least, try pretty hard not to compete on quality and the mediocrity of the 737 is part of that. Every other commercial airliner built today has a modern fly by wire system which can accomplish what MCAS was supposed to do in a safe way. The 737 is noisy for its size https://www.aviationfile.com/noise-pollution-levels-by-aircr... not just in the passenger cabin and on the ground but particularly in the cockpit (years back I wrote a comment on an av blog about the noisy 737 and pilots joined in.) The 737 struggles to take off under good conditions and has to be grounded under conditions that other airliners handle easily. The 737 also lacks the anti-turbulence feature of the A320 which uses the fly-by-wire system to smooth out the ride. People are so used to the dismal 737 and only somewhat better A320 that they have a hard time believing that modern airliners like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_E-Jet_E2_family can be much smaller but much more comfortable than the 737 but people who fly it become believers, the more people who get to experience them the more people will demand them.

I don’t know why you’re so confidently wrong about my position on quality control but it’s irrelevant to the simple fact that all of the failures we’ve seen are the responsibility of Boeing’s management: even if the unionized assembly workers are caricatures straight out of union-busting propaganda, aerospace safety is famously based on the principle of not relying on a single safety mechanism, but in these reports we’re seeing systemic failures where cost savings was prioritized over safety. reply hughesjj 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat do unions have to do with this at all if it was spirit aero systems fucking it up?

Radical action is required or the company could be destroyed. reply maeln 21 hours agoparentFor me this argument always made 0 sense. Dennis Muilenburg was a engineer through and through, and he did pretty much all his career at Boeing. But this is during his time as CEO that all the previous issues with the 737 Max arose, which led to him being fired. You want an engineer CEO, you got one and it didn't help anything. Because that's not what a CEO does in any case. At this level of management, especially in those huge company, you are so far removed from the craft that it is really irrelevant if you have any experience in it. I think, it is way more important to look at the actual owner of Boeing and its general environment. Boeing is now mostly owned by big institutional investment firm [0], and they are the one who choose the CEO. Boeing is also one of the most insanely protected company in the U.S. Whatever Boeing does, the U.S government will always be here to make sure Boeing stays dominant and make life very difficult for any competitor. The situation with the 737 Max was actually a good example where the FAA and the U.S Govt was again very lenient with Boeing, and just gave them a slap on the wrist. So if you were the owner of such company, why not abuse this amount of protection ? Why not push for the maximum profitability at the cost of quality ? If Boeing received more than just a slap in the wrist for the previous 737 Max fuck-up, they would be way more inclined to reevaluate their whole quality process and make sure no incident every happen.

This naively would make sense, but does it actually have any factual weight ? There is so many counter argument to this. Becoming a CEO, from an engineering start, usually involve spending a lot of your career in higher management. At this point, why would you be more sensible to the engineer issues, than the higher management/board/owner ? Climbing the ladder also require at some point to satisfy the requirement of non-engineer, shifting you own goal if what you aim is to be at the top of the ladder. Having an engineer past doesn't guarantee at all that you will listen to engineer more once you have climb the ladder. People just want to continue to create this weird tension between engineer and business people, both trying to act as if they are much better than the other at handling a company, when in actuality, it is the collaboration of both which is successful, and some of the best company manage to harness exactly this. reply meepmorp 13 hours agorootparentprevJack Welch had a PhD in chemical engineering. reply HeyLaughingBoy 20 hours agorootparentprevThe point is that Quality flows from the top down. If the people on top of the organization don't take it seriously, then it's hard for the actual working engineers to get the support they need to do their jobs.

But that wouldn't be true, in reality almost nobody is good enough to run an engineering company. Having an engineer type sure improves your odds compared to general business practitioners, though. It may be like unobtainium but if you had your choice of engineers at an aircraft company you can't do better than one whose mathematical ability puts general business leaders to shame, and who started out building planes at an early age and hasn't forgotten how for their entire career. In fact only gotten better by focusing so strongly on the finances that directly contribute to the most reliable aircraft that can be produced. Even then some will still crash. As we have seen, it's lots better without the temptation to be distracted by the general business trends that come and go, which encourage little manipulations of large resources in ways that any negative outcomes, unforseen or not, will be pushed far enough into the future for decision-makers to have fully cashed out before that time. The worst you could do is have somebody who has never participated in aircraft design, assembly, and maintenance allowed into the chain of command anywhere between the entry-level engineers and the top decision makers. It should go without saying that natural leadership ability has got to be there for it to be sensible for someone to move up the chain of command, but also it needs to be fully rewarding for highly skilled engineers to prosper progressively without having to be very near the ladder that has to be climbed leading to executive duties. As each decade goes by and people overall settle more and more for having non-leaders in leadership positions, you can't expect things to ever be the same in any way unless this pervasive defect can be reversed. It didn't get this way overnight and it can't be fixed overnight. reply unethical_ban 19 hours agorootparentprevTo reframe the point the parent made: Boeing is a special case due to the fact that those above the CEO are uniquely institutional (large investment) and the company enjoys a level of \"socialized failure protection\" from the US government that few other companies get.

The traditional culture of CEOs in the western world isn’t healthy: it’s top down focus and focus on pushing down responsibility and departmental compartmentalization tends to create a lot of the problems the very same management theory fancies itself to solve. Having an actual “buck stops with me” CEO who has experience in the trenches and not managing other people to get the results that would reassure the market and has been shown to work very well in company after company. First principles and the culture of questioning need to be nurtured by competent leaders, and not MBA lead presentations and check in meetings for progress. Sleeping in the factory until this situation is fixed is what needs to happen and it is not this board and management team. Also, this is a board issue first, a CEO issue second. Of course: I’m biased. reply RandomLensman 21 hours agorootparentThat is not really related to my point unless you want to say that engineer CEOs are intrinsically better/not susceptible to bad culture etc. I have worked with great, bad, and middling CEOs and I would not say that it comes down to their degree background where they place in the spectrum of quality.

Edit: aircraft engineering organizations require an executive that understands the airline market and how to build airplanes. This company in particular needs a fixer to address quality problems and reassure the market that substantive changes to the quality of manufacturing will be made. An expert in toy manufacturing who ran Mattel shouldn’t be overseeing jet aircraft production and this idea that they can do so effectively is a big part of the reason companies continually fall down on manufacturing quality and flame out like GE, HP, and now Boeing are doing. Sorry. This idea that a CEO without a background in aerospace can just fly in and fix everything because of transferrable skills sounds good but it’s just simply not true and in fact is the exact and very specific management theory and corporate ideology that is the root cause of the problems at the core issues this company is experiencing*. reply RandomLensman 19 hours agorootparentThere is nothing soft about quality in producing pharmaceuticals, for example.

Also for instance with pharmaceuticals as well as fuels you still use the exact same models of the latest spectrometers and chromatographs, so specialized expertise here carries over ideally but that is just the instrument, not the particular science being conducted. What it comes down to is that someone with decades of experience in pharma can be useful in the fuel lab and vice versa, but it still takes years to get up to speed before the wisest decisions can be made since either way this type of thing is not soft about quality. That much it shares with aircraft reliability. It takes a certain type of leadership to prevail in a situation like Boeing (and many others) did during World War II, and this has been so sorely lost by now that there is very little remaining linkage back to the real thing. And while I'm here don't ask me how I know the airline companies' fuel is tested as reliably as their fuselages, and by a bureau with management hierarchy having a degree of dedication that's noticeably more modern than what was once expected in the past. reply jpalawaga 18 hours agorootparentprevwhat did ballmer do at microsoft before he was CEO?

Engineering is one of the few fields that understands value. Most other functions, within a corporation, are more process oriented and have a more transactional world view as a consequence of dealing with costs for most of their activities. In other words, if you want to slash budgets, lay off staff, and deliver value to shareholders, your faithful MBA is your go to. If you want to build cultures that create products that strive to satisfy arrays of non-functional requires, like efficiency, reliability, and safety, engineering managers have spent their careers building these departments. reply RandomLensman 21 hours agorootparentYou are describing a manager yourself, so not sure we disagree disagree that much. reply jsharf 21 hours agorootparentprevI assume it’s easier to find an engineer who went to engineering school to learn how to build airplanes that are safe than it is to find an MBA who went to business school to learn how to build planes that are safe. (It’s not about the knowledge but about the root desire) Similarly, I assume it’s harder to find an engineer who went into the field purely for money. I do think on average engineers will prioritize safety (since they likely understand failure modes and production and long tail statistics better. We literally have to take engineering ethics classes), at the cost of doing a worse job at running the business. But when the business requires this level of safety, that IS doing a good job. reply RandomLensman 21 hours agorootparentYou need to be able to steer a large and complex organisation - being an engineer has nothing to do with that.

For example, that the proportion of engineers that are great CEOs is higher than the proportion of MBAs or lawyers or chemist or ... that are great CEOs. Maybe that is true, but I haven't seen it. Edit: we could also look at a narrower problem, for example: is the performance of engineer CEOs in \"engineering companies\" better on average than that of non-engineer CEOs in that sector?

Cool. reply photonthug 21 hours agorootparentprevNot clear at all that the best CEO is an MBA either. Putting an MBA in charge of engineering processes is like arguing anyone can do it, so if that's the position then why the resistance towards it being an engineer? If you want a culture expert, how about a history prof or an anthropologist? \"Experience running large organizations\" usually just equates to failing upwards.. run the last few orgs you admin into the ground and hide the debris with outsourcing, mergers, acquisitions, anything that hides your responsibility long enough to dodge accountability, move on to the next before it gets pinned on you. Do that 10 or 15 times, and that's a great career for most of the leadership/culture \"experts\" in the CEO world. I don't get the apologism or tendency to lionize these people reply RandomLensman 20 hours agorootparentWhy is it always MBA vs engineer? I never advocated for that. As you point out lots of other choices. reply happytiger 21 hours agorootparentprevQuality is an engineering attribute: a byproduct of a culture that by definition survives in a company despite profit drive by putting minimum standards and support for people who keep them before or in balance with the bottom line concerns. Quality isn’t a culture, it’s literally a product engineering concerns that get prioritized. The old school management theory is that engineering leaders are accountable to shipping quality products on time and within budget. That’s it. But a CEO's historical understanding of engineering operations has been pretty opaque: ships on time, or doesn't. Of course this is lacking everything meaningful about software. So the same visionary management theory has come up with a concept of DORA metrics. This provides the competency with quality management metrics that allow for decision-making around whether engineering is delivering or not and a whole new level of understanding and abstraction. But understand that most of the companies that are getting themselves in deep shit right now are doing so because they have removed power from their engineering organizations to the point where, and the service of relentless extraction of shareholder value, they have destroyed their companies and crippled their products. It is happened to quite a few companies and manufacturers in the United States, from GE to Boeing, and from IBM to GM. The current profit comes from revenue not reputation culture thinks that you can build some level of abstraction to engineering management, and then layer on traditional management theory in order to extract value from a chain of command. The truth is that engineering lead organizations deliver a great deal, more value to shareholders in the long-term, as they are more focused on building the platforms that create competitive long-term foundations. Companies like Netflix, Google, Apple, and other “tech companies” occupy the top value of the stock market in equities positions around the world, because of the fact that they are able to use software to amplify the value of their innovations at profound levels. But America’s Legacy companies continue to operate as if this lesson is not true they continue to prioritize optimization over platform. The old system continues to persist with the idea that there must be a professional manager at the top of the organization, rather than someone who is focused on creating value with platforms, and the culture tends to produce these situations of crisis in exploitation, because they do not understand how important it is to create a culture of platform value creation. So of course, I make the comment that we should have an “engineering experience CEO,” or even an actual engineer in the CEO seat, and predictably it ends up being criticized for the fact that we could have a professional manager in that seat, and don’t actually need an engineer to be a CEO. That’s fine, and I can understand the point you’re raising. But, it’s been my experience that CEOs that have been in involved in platform, engineering and large scale systems management do a much better job of preserving the culture that creates lasting and durable platform value for companies like Boeing, and this is the value which has been destroyed and the culture which must be resurrected before the company crashes. So, rather than bringing another abstraction specialist, who will find another metric values system to manage things, which isn’t working, I was suggesting that we should bring in an actual engineer to sleep on the factory floor and make sure that this culture stops before someone dies and the share price drops to unrecoverable levels (where it’s going!). To expound I’ll say this. The current culture at Boeing is very much a culture where the engineers don’t speak up. Many of the most passionate people who worked there have been fired or let go because they spoke up so, I think it’s time for a change before one of the most storied and important companies in American history becomes yet another casualty of the MBA-lead, value extracting management theory. So in sun, it really doesn’t matter if the CEO is an engineer, but it matters that the CEO is not working with abstractions, and therefore I was making the suggestion that the CEO should be an engineer, or at least come from engineering as a background, so that we do not continue the pattern of incompetent management that has gotten this company to the brink of failure. Forgive my typos, I had to dictate this as I’m traveling. reply RandomLensman 20 hours agorootparentI think you describe a much more particular issue with perhaps average(?) US executive eduction and practice where perhaps MBAs are overemphasised. I disagree that quality is specific to engineering. Lots of other fields understand quality, too. reply happytiger 20 hours agorootparentManufacturing quality. These are manufacturing problems. reply clouddrover 20 hours agorootparentprev> I don't think you need an engineer as CEO for that. You need a CEO who actually understands the business. If your business is building planes and your CEO has never built a plane, then your business will inevitably have problems because the CEO fundamentally doesn't understand the business. It won't happen immediately but a slow rot will set in. The CEO won't pay attention to the details because he never understood the details in the first place. Optus recently had a major network outage. Part of the reason why that happened is they picked a CEO with no telecommunications background. She fundamentally didn't understand the business she was in: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/tech/australia-optus-netw... She's since quit as Optus CEO in an \"I don't want to fix my own mess\" move. She doesn't seem to have paid that much attention to Optus anyway: https://www.afr.com/rear-window/optus-a-part-time-gig-for-ce... reply RandomLensman 20 hours agorootparentSo what exactly would the CEO have to have done to \"build planes\"? Some wiring? Screwing in things? Ordered parts? Quality tested a component? Why not the need to also piloting a plane to understand how it works? What specific part imbues the required understanding? What if CEO build other things than planes? reply arcbyte 19 hours agorootparentYou need two types of experience: deep and abstract. You need the deep experience of having worked inside the beaurocracy of a huge effort on some tiny piece of the project. You need the abstract experience of having built a smaller, less complicated version of an entire plane yourself. Think RC model plane here. And yes you should be at least an RC pilot. With both of those experiences you will be able to extrapolate very closely everything you need to know to be succesful in establishing an engineering culture. reply clouddrover 20 hours agorootparentprevTo actually have done something and contributed to designing and producing aircraft.

Should experts always be in control everywhere or are there limits? reply Filligree 17 hours agorootparentThe military likely would be more effective with generals in charge, yes. There are downsides to that, which is why we don't do it. You can judge for yourself if those same downsides apply to Boeing. reply RandomLensman 17 hours agorootparentI think that goes to the heart of it: I am not sure generals would necessarily be better at achieving the political objectives of what the military is for. In the same way, I couldn't say if Boing would need something more closer to a priest or a technocrat. reply nvm0n2 11 hours agorootparentprevCivilians control but don't manage the military. They control it, in the sense of setting the goals, but they don't generally manage things after that. The equivalent here would be the customers. reply clouddrover 12 hours agorootparentprevCivilians don't run the military. The military experts run the military. That's a good thing. And the military doesn't run the government. That's also a good thing. The only way your analogy works is if you think it's a good idea to appoint generals and admirals who have no military experience. I hope you don't. reply RandomLensman 11 hours agorootparentIn most Western countries the most senior person in command is a civilian, not a general or admiral (and there are civilians in various other positions, too). reply clouddrover 11 hours agorootparentAnswer what has been put to you: Do you think people with no military experience should be generals and admirals? reply RandomLensman 3 hours agorootparentI don't see that as the right analogy, because the highest command authority already is with a civilian. Anyway, why not under certain circumstances? Already now there are differences between countries what is run by the military and what isn't. reply clouddrover 20 minutes agorootparent> Anyway, why not under certain circumstances? Because someone with no military experience is inexpert. They don't know what they're doing.

That's four years ago and that was root caused to a single issue which has since been addressed. Before that the 737 had a great safety record. In fact it still does. Not perfect but pretty amazing considering it's the most widely use plane ever produced. After that there have been a few incidents, including the non fatal one with the door. But nothing out of the ordinary. Here's a list of all the incidents with the 737 over the years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incident... If anything, this decade is looking pretty good so far. I'm not saying there's nothing going on at Boeing in terms of management and quality control. But hadn't it been for the issues a few years ago, this would barely register in the news as anything else than the minor incident this was. But because that was in the news, now any Boeing related news is causing world + dog to panic. And that apparently includes FAA leadership and management at major airlines. They are apparently more worried about how it reflects on them than about the actual facts. I think the grounding of the aircraft has much more to do with politics and appearances than with actual safety. It was premature and probably overkill. People insisting on expensive audits and other draconian measures have basically persuaded the FAA to do what they otherwise wouldn't dream of doing: ground loads of planes over an issue that can probably be excluded with a simple, straightforward inspection. There hasn't been a lot of detail about what exactly went wrong. Nobody waited for that to be revealed even. But I bet it's something straight forward like a missing bolt or something similarly easy to check and verify. If you are an airline and you own anything even mildly re",

    "originLink": "https://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/2024/how-we-made-an-animated-movie-in-8kb",
    "originBody": "How we made an animated movie in 8kB 5 Replies In November 2022, we set ourselves a challenge: make a real-time animation that looks like a standard short animated movie, with the constraint that it should fit in 8 kilobytes. The goal was to have decent graphics, animations, direction and camera work, and the matching music… Yes, 8 kilobytes, less than half of this post, for everything. It wasn’t clear how much was actually feasible, so we had to try it. In April 2023, after months of work, we finally released The Sheep and the Flower. You can run it by yourself (download link), or see a YouTube capture of the program running: Many people asked how we were able to create something like this. This article will explain the technical details and design constraints behind this production. We’ve also made the source code public on GitHub. Overview The result is a Windows executable file. It’s a single .exe file that generates everything. It requires no resource file, no external depency, except for Windows and up-to-date drivers. Here’s the quick summary of what we used. We’ll explain the details in the rest of the post. All the visuals are computed in real-time on the GPU, using GLSL shaders. This includes the timeline information, camera setup, etc. The rendering is done with raymarching. The shaders are minified using my own tool, Shader Minifier. The music was composed using OpenMPT and the 4klang synthesizer, which generates an assembly file able to replay the music. The instruments are described procedurally, while the list of notes is simply compressed. The code was written in C++ using Visual Studio 2022. To get started with the compiler flags and initialization, we used the Leviathan framework. The final output was compressed using Crinkler. Genesis One day, I saw a message from a former colleague, who shared a video he made a long time ago, called Capoda. I immediately loved the concept. The content is simple, yet it manages to tell a story efficiently. I shared the link with some friends and thought it could be a good example of a story suitable for size coding. I was about to add this concept to the list of cool things I’ll probably never do, when Anatole replied: Looks like a perfect fit for 8kb ! Will you do it? I have always dreamed of making a prod like this, but I’m waiting for the “good and original idea”. I was excited by the project because I wanted to do more demos with story-telling and animations. At the same time, I was intrigued by the challenges of making something in 8kB: I usually target 64kB, which is a completely different world, with a different set of rules and challenges. For the music, I knew I could count on my old friend CyborgJeff. Anatole had a lot of experience with 4kB. With him, the project was much more likely to be successful. And that’s how we started working together. I was not certain it would be feasible to fit everything in 8kB, but there’s only one way to know, right? Why specifically 8kB? In the demoscene, there are multiple size categories, with 4kB and 64kB being very common. I’ve always enjoyed the techniques used in 4kB intros (an intro is a demo with a tight size limitation), but it always feels too limited for proper storytelling. Revision, the biggest demoparty in the world, added an 8kB competition a few years ago, so it was a good opportunity to try it. Rendering Worlds with Two Triangles People familiar with the demoscene already know it, as this is a standard approach since 2008: we draw a rectangle (so, two triangles) to cover the full screen. Then, we run a GPU program (called a shader) on the rectangle using the GLSL language. The program will compute a color for each pixel and each frame. All we need is a function that takes coordinates (and time) as input, and returns a color. Simple, right? “Please draw me a sheep!” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince Of course, the big question is: how do we write a function that draws a sheep? Let’s split the problem in two parts: Represent the scene as a signed distance field. Use raymarching to convert the distance fields into pixels. Signed Distance Fields (SDF) A distance field is a function that computes the distance between a point in space to the nearest object. For every point in space, we want to know how far the point is to the object. If a point is one the object’s surface, the function should return 0. This is a “signed” function, meaning that it will return a negative number for points inside the object. In the most basic cases, the function is simple to write. For example, the distance between a point and a sphere is trivial to compute. For a cube, you can also do it in a couple of lines (see The SDF of a Box for explanations). Lots of other building blocks have been documented. Inigo Quilez has a nice collection of simple reusable shapes and the Mercury demo group also provides a great library. The true power of distance fields emerges when you combine them. To get the union of two objects, you can simply pick the minimum of the two distances, while the maximum gives the intersection. When crafting organic shapes, mathematical unions may appear coarse, but alternative formulas like the smooth unions can create more organic looks. Once you have a toolset with building blocks, it feels like playing with legos to create an object or a scene. Thus we made our sheep by assembling simple shapes (for example a cone, a sphere) and merging them, while the body and wool consist of a 3D noise function. The next task will be to actually render the distance function to the screen. Raymarching To draw the 3D scene on the screen, we use raymarching. Raymarching is a rendering technique that leverages SDFs to trace rays through a 3D scene. Unlike traditional ray tracing, which mathematically computes the intersection point, raymarching works by marching along the ray’s path. The SDF tells us how far we can walk without colliding with the scene. We can then move the ray origin and compute the new distance. We repeat the operation until the distance is 0 (or close to it). In the image below, imagine that the ray origin is the camera. It is looking in a certain direction. After multiple iterations, we find the intersection point with the right wall. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching#Sphere_tracing. Once we have the intersection point, we know if the current pixel should be a part of the sheep, the sky, or any other object. For the lighting, we need to know at least the surface normal, which we can estimate by computing the gradient in the same area. To compute shadows, we can send another ray for the point to the sun and find if an object is in between. Many techniques exist to improve the rendering quality beyond this basic idea. To better understand the technical details, the tutorial “Ray Marching and Signed Distance Functions” is a good start. If you have more time, the video Live Coding “Greek Temple” is a wonderful in-depth example with detailed explanations. Early rendering Direction Imagine that you have to tell a story, but there is only one character, with no voice or written text, and that character is barely animated. It can only walk (but not turn!), move the head and the eyes. With only this, how would you tell a story and convey emotions? When creating a demo with such a small size limit, it’s critical to know what is important. We avoided anything that didn’t serve that story. For example, we originally imagined the sheep walking in a desert. It wouldn’t be hard to generate dunes and a sky, but the story didn’t actually need it. We decided to keep the pure white background. We also skipped the textures, except for a few that convey a meaning (like the signs and the eyes). Keeping the scope of the work relatively small allowed us to focus on things that might not be obvious at first: the details and the polish, the camera work, the editing, and the synchronization. Each shot was manually crafted, each animation was adjusted and went through many iterations to make sure the flow feels right. Not only did we need to make sure the flow felt right (adjusting the length of the shots and the sequencing), but it had to match the music. To ensure that the narrative resonates with the audience, we employed a number of storytelling techniques, often with redundancy for emphasis. For example, to show the sheep’s excitement, we used cartoonish 2D effects, accelerated the walking pace, accentuated tail movements, exaggerated head swings, and added a dramatic shift in the music. This approach allowed us to convey a spectrum of emotions throughout the story. The camera itself is also a storytelling tool. We used a wide shot to evoke a sense of solitude when the sheep wanders for hours; an extreme closeup on its eyes to capture the moment of realization when it notices the sign; and a slow zoom on the head to intensify the focus when the sheep stares at a sign. A 2D animated background was used to communicate the appeal of the flower. Development process You may notice that the source code contains a large number of hard-coded constants. The challenge was to determine these values — how large should the sheep’s eyes be? How fast should the camera move? How long should each shot last? What colors should the flower have? Given this uncertainty, each constant went through numerous iterations. To iterate quickly and have a short feedback loop, shaders come in handy: we recompile them at runtime to update the graphics within a second. The other requirement was to have a player: something that allows us to control the time with pause and replay commands. This proved to be invaluable when working on animations and camera control, as we could see the result instantly after a live-reload of the shader. Additionally, music support was a must, so that we can perfectly synchronize the animations to the music. We designed our early prototypes in Shadertoy, but we later transitioned to KodeLife, and finally moved the code to our own project (in C++, using a small framework called Leviathan). Music Music is a critical component for storytelling. To fit the story, the music needed multiple parts, with different moods and transitions at specific points in time. We decided to use the same tools as we would in a 4kB intro, while allocating more space to allow a more intricate composition. To compose the music, I asked my Cyborgjeff, a friend familiar with demoscene techniques, whose musical style resonated with our vision. His tool of choice was the 4klang synthesizer, an impressive piece of software developed by Gopher. 4klang comes with a plugin usable from any music software and it has an export button that generates an assembly file. This file is then compiled and linked with the demo. When the demo runs, the synth will run in a separate thread, procedurally generate the wave sound, and send it to the soundcard. Creating a small music comes with a lot of constraints. The first version of the music was bigger than expected. Imagine telling a musician “Your music is too big, can you reduce it by 500 bytes?” Well, that’s just normal in the demoscene. We studied the output of 4klang to understand how it packs the data. With advice from Gopher, Cyborgjeff was able to iterate on the music to make it smaller. We made multiple adjustments: The number of instruments was reduced from 16 to 13. The ending theme was recomposed to align with the tempo of the overall music. The composition used more repetitions so it compresses better. For example, adjusting the length of a note in the background may be imperceptible to the ear while improving the compression ratio. This allowed us to save some space on the music, while keeping its overall structure, with a minimal loss in terms of quality. For more information on the music, Cyborgjeff wrote a blog post: 8000 octets, un mouton et une fleur. Animation & Synchronization Everything in the demo is re-evaluated at each frame as nothing is precomputed or cached. While this is really bad for the performance, this is a blessing for animations: anything can depend on the time and vary through the demo. The demo consists of around 25 manually crafted camera shots. When creating a shot, we describe how each of 18 parameters varies over time, such as the position of each object, the state of the sheep, the position of the camera, the focal, what the camera is looking at, etc. For example, a single line of code describes the camera during the shot: camPos = vec3(22., 2., time*0.6-10.); And we get a linear translation. Here “time” represents the time since the beginning of the shot so that we can easily insert, remove or adjust a shot without affecting the rest of the demo. Absolute times are avoided for code maintenance. A note of caution on linear interpolations: while functional, they often look poor or robotic. In many cases, we apply the smoothstep function, which leads to a smoother, more natural animation. Smoothstep is an S-shaped smooth interpolation that helps avoid sharp edges and sudden movement changes. The code for the timeline is in the vertex shader. You may notice that each shot is defined in a similar way, and the code may seem redundant. It’s not a problem, as redundancy leads to better compression. Textures & Materials In a traditional renderer, textures are 2D images that are applied on a 3D model. One difficulty with the textures is how to compute the texture coordinates and map each pixel in the texture to the 3D surface. With our raymarching approach, we can’t easily compute texture coordinates. Instead, we compute on the fly 3D textures. Once the raymarcher finds the 3D position of the point to render, we pass the 3D coordinates to the corresponding texture function. Let’s take a look at the traffic signs. They use some math to compute a triangle or a square to serve as a border, then the inner content of the sign is achieved by combining multiple functions. For example, the restaurant symbol is created with 4 black oval-like shapes, and 2 white shapes are added to create the dents. To make the visuals more interesting, we wanted to have not just textures, but also different materials. Parameters of the lighting equation depend on the material. For example, the sheep hooves have a different reflection (using fresnel coefficients). Eyes For a long time during the development, the eyes looked dull and lifeless. I believe eyes are a big part of the character design. This was one of the first things that we animated, and it was very important as a tool for story-telling. Eyes help show feelings and they enable many transitions. Early rendering After searching for reference images on the Internet, I found that most of the cartoon characters have an iris, but the iris doesn’t seem to be strictly required. I’ve also noticed that the pupil is always big. If there’s an iris, the pupil will be big compared to the iris. But the important part to get sparkling eyes is to have some reflections of the light in the eyes. With the standard lighting equations we used, we couldn’t get a reflection (unless the sun and the camera were at very specific positions). An input of the lighting equations is the normal vector of the surface. Our trick was to modify the vector to increase the probability of getting some reflections from the sun. On top of that, we created an environment mapping. This technique is commonly used in video games: instead of computing perfect reflections in the scene in real time, we can look up in a texture (that simulates the environment). Usually, people use environment mapping to optimize the code as the texture can be a simplification of the real environment. We did the opposite: our environment world is actually a perfect white, but we used a texture to fake and add details. Final result The reflections in the eyes (both the white and the pupils) are much more complex than they should be in an empty world. There are multiple fake sources of lights, as well as a gradient (to mimic a darker ground and a blue-ish sky). Post-processing Once everything is done, the final visual touch defining the mood is the post-processing. Despite being subtle, it helps have a good image quality and set the tone for the story. We used: color grading; gamma correction; a bit of vignetting; finally, a two-pass FXAA filter to avoid aliasing (but you won’t notice it if you only watched the YouTube capture) We also implemented some of the effects in the post-processing step, such as the stars in the eyes or the ending screen effect. Those are made as pure 2D and don’t exist in the 3D world. Finally, we experimented with other alternative styles. At some point, we tried to give an old-cartoon look, and we implemented contour detection to simulate a hand-drawn image, with a monochrome rendering, grain, and noise. The result looked like this: After discussions, we decided to give up on this experiment and focus on the cleaner, modern look. Compression So far, we’ve seen how we made most of the demo. The main idea is to avoid storing data, instead we use code to describe how to generate the data. For the music, we store a list of notes to play, as well as a list of instructions for each instrument. All of this is relatively small, but does it really fit in 8kB? Part of the magic comes from Crinkler, a compression tool specifically designed for the demoscene and intros between 1kB and 8kB. As the executable needs to be self-extractible, Crinkler includes some very small and clever assembly code that can decompress the rest of the executable. It’s optimized for size at the expense of other things: the compression algorithm takes a while, the decompression is relatively slow and uses a lot of RAM (hundreds of megabytes). Crinkler is an impressive tool, but it doesn’t do everything. We have a total of 42kB of shader source code and we need one last ingredient to fit it in the binary. Minification As the shader source code is included in the final binary, we have to make it as small as possible. It would be possible to minify the code by hand, but then it would cause maintenance issues. It was critical for the success of our project to be able to iterate quickly, without worrying about low-level size optimizations. So we needed a tool to minify the shader. I have written such a tool, Shader Minifier, which has been a side project of mine since 2011. It removes unneeded spaces and comments, it renames variables and can do more. It has been the most popular shader minification tool in the demoscene for many years, but this was not sufficient for us: an 8kB intro contains much more code than a 4kB does, and new problems arise from the larger code size. I stopped working on the demo for one month to implement all the missing features we needed from Shader Minifier. While it’s easy to write a simple minifier, you need to write a compiler if you want to get good minification — a source-to-source compiler, similar to what Closure Compiler does. The full list of transformations supported by Shader Minifier is getting quite long, but here are a few: Renaming of variables and functions Inlining of variables Evaluation of constant arithmetic Inlining of functions Dead code elimination Merging of declarations These transformations reduce the size of the output, but it’s not enough. We need to make sure that the output is compression-friendly. This is a hard problem: it can happen that a transformation reduces the size of the code, while increasing the size of the compressed code. So we constantly need to monitor the compressed size, as we iterate on the demo. New improvements to Shader Minifier have saved around 600 bytes on the compressed binary. To help review and monitor what exactly goes in the final binary, we store the minified output in the repository. This proved useful to identify new optimization opportunities. At the end, once minified and compressed, the 42kB of shader code fits in about 5kB, which gives just enough space for the music and the C++ code. Anyway… you could say that I had to write a compiler in order to make this demo. :) The War Between the Sheep and the Flowers It’s not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers? […] Suppose I happen to know a unique flower, one that exists nowhere in the world except on my planet, one that a little sheep can wipe out in a single bite one morning, just like that, without even realizing what he’d doing – that isn’t important? If someone loves a flower of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that’s enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars. He tells himself ‘My flower’s up there somewhere…’ But if the sheep eats the flower, then for him it’s as if, suddenly, all the stars went out. And that isn’t important?” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince Conclusion As you’ve seen, there are lots of advanced and fascinating techniques needed to make this kind of demo. But we didn’t invent everything. We’re building on top of what other people did. The amount of work and research that was done by other people is incredible, from the raymarching techniques, to the music generation software and the compression algorithms. Hopefully the new features added to Shader Minifier will help other people create better demos in the future. The 8kB category is fun and offers more possibilities than the 4kB category; let’s hope it will become more popular. P.S. For comparison, the text of this article contains around 21,000 characters, so it would take 21kB.

However, it's interesting that AFAIK the majority of these demos rely on the GPU and its powerful 3D acceleration capabilities, but 2D (Japanese)anime-style demos seem to be rare and nonexistent in the smaller sizes. Is 3D animation actually easier? As a side-note, \"mouton\" is the French word for \"sheep\", and thus \"mutton\". reply throwaway17_17 5 hours agoparentI think the way you described it explains the prevalence of 3D for demos. Geometric shapes in 3D can be described in closed form equations requiring a minimum of storage, however, the only ‘mathematical’ way to store 2D style animation is as SVG curves for outline and then a space filling algorithm for the coloring of those areas. The curves are, I am making a back of the envelope guess, going to require as much storage for a single arc/line as the description of a geometric volume in total. Then there is the issue of storing the animation of those curves which is going to require even more space, compared to the relatively small transformation matrix for the 3D volume. I would also guess the complexity of the rendering algorithm would increase (both in actual algorithmic and space complexity). — Caveat: one could argue that storing a series of bitmaps and then playing them back like a flip book could be ‘mathematical’, especially if some procedural uncompressing algorithm was used to generate full frames from on some change differential, but I don’t think that exists and the space requirement would be huge compared to 3D volumetric descriptions. reply nine_k 3 hours agorootparentI don't see why interesting 2D animation could not be made using closed forms. A rectangle takes 2 parameters for shape, and 2 for position; 3 if you rotate it. Similarly for an ellipse. Realistically you also need a Z-index. The soft-min function mentioned in the post would allow to merge 2D shapes the same way as 3D shapes, at the expense of one additional parameter. An approach similar to the signed depth field and ray marching can be used to determine boundaries, and thus the kind of painting inside. This would require to start a scan line at a position which is guaranteed to be outside of any of the shapes; this must be easy. Texturing would be harder, but, knowing the position inside the shape relative to its center, it would be possible to procedurally generate nice gradients, regular textures like bricks or scales, or noisy textures like fur. Using the same trick with calculating the gradient would allow to create nice thick / styled outlines. Doing this on a CPU would, of course, be pretty slow, so this would need to be written as a bunch of shaders somehow. I don't see why it won't work though: each shader could take one scanline, they would share the same geometric model, and shaders are good at doing a lot of FPU math in parallel. reply lifthrasiir 6 hours agoparentprevGiven that most 2D animations would still depict events in 3D space, it would be far easier to describe 3D events directly in general. reply tombert 12 hours agoprevI know the tech behind it is pretty different, but this reminds me of .kkrieger from back in the day.

That means that yes, the graphics and sound are all generated on the fly by the 8kB exe. reply olddustytrail 13 hours agorootparentBut stock version of Windows has a ton of stuff you can use. All sorts of graphics and audio files. And that again depends on which version you're basing it on. I think it would be cool to run a competition with more specific (and platform independent) set of constraints. I guess I should spend more time thinking about how to organise it myself than complaining that no-one else has! reply msk-lywenn 13 hours agorootparentIt's usually forbidden to rely on those files as they can disappear with updates of windows. The best example I can think of is General MIDI. The files were avaialble with XP and below, and is now often explicitly forbidden because it's not available anymore or not in the same form making demos incompatible. It's also often forbidden to use the filename to store data. There was that case of the 256B demo that relied on a deep hierarchy of directories to work :) reply jsheard 11 hours agorootparentIndeed, the rules for the Revision party where this was released require the intro to run on Windows 10 (so implicitly no MIDI) and specify that the sample music that comes with Windows will be deleted. https://2023.revision-party.net/competitions/pc/ reply jsheard 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are competitions for all sorts of retro computer and game console platforms which are \"purer\" in the sense that there's little to no operating system at all, so the demo has to be programmed against the bare metal. That's not feasible for modern PCs though, you need the OS infrastructure and drivers to abstract over the variety of hardware. Or if you're web-inclined you could use the browser as your OS: https://0b5vr.com/domain/domain.html / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2COWeeEqTs https://fms-cat.github.io/condition/pages / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co42e8ErbaY reply ogurechny 8 hours agorootparentprevHas been done and discussed (flamed) ages ago, in the early Windows demos era. An operating system has a lot of “free” data, graphical or otherwise (from wallpapers to icon resources), which can be used directly or processed into something else. The code to access them cam become too big, but hacks are possible. There's also a question of fonts. Is it OK to use them to “just put some text on screen”, is it OK to use them as a source of all kinds of curves? It is hard to define where “the program” ends, and the rest of the system starts. After all, they all need to load libraries to interact with GPU into their process space. Those libraries have debug functions, example data, and other junk which is not used to put pictures on screen, but is available. Then what if a tiny application links to 50 system libraries only to have a database of potentially suitable data sequences here and there? And long before that, even regular software on microcomputers struggling to save each byte relied on known values being in known locations in ROM. It worked, because each device came from the factory with the same firmware, and it could never ever be changed for the reason I've just mentioned. The solution turns out to be pretty simple: if you think you're smart, other smart people will study your trick, and decide whether it's impressive, or just a one-time joke. Formal rules for demoparties don't mention many possible “size extending techniques” because it's generally accepted that they won't help much compared to what can be done in the same amount of bytes directly by a competent author. reply laurentlb 13 hours agoparentprevThe result is an 8kB Windows executable file. It is self-contained: there's only one .exe file, that generates everything (without resource files). You can download it and execute it (it requires a relatively recent GPU). I'll see how I can edit the text to make this more obvious. reply jll29 9 hours agorootparentWow, it's not even an ASCII art movie!

    "originBody": "Celebrating our first 20,000 members 24 Jan, 2024 Dear Kagi community, Today, we’re happy and proud to have reached 20,000 paying members, including over 1,500 families all over the world, in our community. We have come a very long way since the first few lines of code and the crazy idea that a search company could not only displace giants for every day use, but do it in a sustainable, user-centric way. Early Kagi team, two years ago The community has always been at the center of our mission. You all have supported us through thick and thin, have sent us so many lovely messages of support at times when it seemed like the mountain was too high to climb, and enabled us to seed a new internet, better for humans. Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know that I love Kagi. It’s awesome. Thank you Jason, without support from you and 20,000 other Kagi lovers around the world we would not be able to be here today. 🙏 For all of this, we’d like to thank you. As we previously announced, we’re going to launch a merchandise store this year. It’s been quite a journey to set it up, and we’d hoped to align its launch date with today, but unfortunately the paperwork gods have decided otherwise (plus we did not expect we will reach 20k as soon!)… Nevertheless here is what we’re going to do: When the merch store goes live in about 8 weeks, first 20,000 Kagi members will get a free Kagi T-shirt + sticker pack (excluding shipping). If there are unclaimed shirts left after a few weeks, we’ll send vouchers to all the new members that joined in the meantime on a first come, first serve basis. Sizes are first come first serve too. We have four t-shirt designs to pick from. Here is what they look like (click to enlarge): And of course, Doggo sticker pack! Setting up this project was a significant challenge, and true to our ethos, Kagi approached it with a ‘hard mode on’ mentality, aiming for high quality and meticulous attention to detail in the t-shirts. We initially engaged with several popular merch providers used by many large companies, but after months of testing, none could meet our standards for precision and quality. The journey led us back to a modest print shop in a small town near Novi Sad, Serbia, where we first created our remarkable t-shirts years ago. Despite initial doubts about their capacity, they impressively accepted and successfully fulfilled our large order of 20,000 t-shirts on schedule. The process from here involves setting up a business entity in Germany, so we can import the t-shirts, store them in a warehouse, connect inventory logistics and ship them all over the world. This includes building a website and connecting it to a back-end database. So, we basically ended up owning a merch production operation end-to-end, just so that we could ensure premium quality of these t-shirts! Now, you may ask, why did we go through all this trouble and allocate nearly a third of our investor-raised funds to produce and freely distribute 20,000 t-shirts? We would not be here without our early adopters (you!) and we deemed it important to pause, reflect and show gratitude. We acknowledge that our journey is a marathon, not a sprint. With a long road ahead, supporting our member community is both rewarding and meaningful. Simply put, wearing the Doggo t-shirt is an incredibly awesome experience.

As most of you have probably noticed Google search results have seriously dropped in quality the last few years, but especially in 2023. I'm no longer able to get meaningful results for almost any topic, especially if it's technical, the only results are AI generated (?) / obvious SEO spam websites. It takes me multiple different search terms and clicking through multiple results to find anything semi relevant, and even then it's a shallow article maybe summarising what I'm looking for. Unfortunately DDG seems to be going the same way. Whereas Kagi reminds me of the 'old' google search. The results are meaningful and relevant, not diluted with pages of generic article results. They also offer a lot of great customisation options like being able to block or boost certain sites in results. They have some built in lists for common filler sites. I can't comment on the AI variation but I hear that's progressing well. I wouldn't call myself a power user of Kagi, but even then I'm getting far better results than other search engines, definitely worth the price per month. I'm not affiliated with them in any way, just thought I'd share my anecdotal experience. reply anon-3988 8 hours agoparent> I wouldn't call myself a power user of Kagi, but even then I'm getting far better results than other search engines, definitely worth the price per month. This only works as long as Kagi is a niche. The moment any search engine becomes commonplace I think they will inevitably succumb to SEO. Otherwise, they would have to change their methodologies every once in a while to completely flip the ecosystem. reply rapind 5 hours agorootparentI think it also has to do with incentives. If your business model is selling ads then you have a balancing act between user and customer satisfaction. With Kagi as I understand it, the customer is the user since it’s a premium product that isn’t selling ads. There’s really no good reason for them not to just nuke bad actors. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentprevNot necessarily. You'll still be able to nuke the whole domain from your results, permanently. That means you'll see the spam once, and getting a new domain promoted to the top takes time and effectively money. I also hope that domains which get blocked by lots of people will get reviewed for global downranking, but I don't think that's happening yet? reply anon-3988 7 hours agorootparentThat is true, I really wish I can tell Google to simply filter out learncpp.com and some other websites. reply hyperpl 7 hours agorootparentI managed to filter that, geeksforgeeks.org and towardsdatascience.com out with Kagi. It's quite helpful being able to slightly reduce prioritization on a per site basis so that instead of showing up as top result it'll be buried a bit but still accessible. reply thegeekpirate 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can with browser extensions, fwiw. reply miohat 5 hours agorootparentuBlacklist can only block sites. But Kagi can raise or lower sites in pagerank, and can pin sites on the top. Boosting sites up in the result is more efficient than blocking spam sites one by one. reply ajdude 3 hours agorootparentprev> The moment any search engine becomes commonplace I think they will inevitably succumb to SEO Thankfully when I come across a irrelevant domain in Kagi I can just remove it from any future search results completely. If enough people do that, it may show up on the \"most commonly removed\" list inviting others to also ax it. I rarely ever have an issue with spam on Kagi just by largely using the standard filters, and I'm confident this will remain the case. And unrelated but I really like that I can redirect all reddit urls in search results to old.reddit.com, twitter to nitter etc. very helpful in searching on mobile. reply beej71 5 hours agorootparentprevIf that SEO means removing ads and tracking from your page to get a higher rank, I'm cool with it. :) reply tomrod 8 hours agorootparentprevTwo-sided/platform market dynamics are really interesting to this economist. I wonder if kagi's going to have to charge for listings some day, instead of users paying in, if they intend to grow substantially. reply weikju 5 hours agorootparentprevhopefully what will happen is no single search engine will be dominant, ensuring that problem can't happen (we'll probably have other problems instead) reply calvinmorrison 8 hours agorootparentprevSEO should be called \"GEO\", it's google optimization. Spam keyword blogsites only work because google prioritizes that stuff. They're driven by ad revenue so they're incentivized to show commerical sites over non commercial ones, etc. ,etc, etc.,etc. reply nine_k 8 hours agoparentprevGoogle Search is a victim of its own success. They are the biggest search engine; every SEO trick, every spam attack is spearheaded against them. But also being the biggest and the inevitable, they can afford to blunt their search tool somehow in order to show more lucrative sort-of-hits and sell more ads. A moral hazard to do such a thing is always present fr any market-dominating player. Kagi, in comparison, is tiny, and almost nobody cares to attack their algorithms. Back in 1990s, when Macs were a small minority in the PC-dominated world, they were the safest desktop machines, because almost nobody cared to write malware for them. Now that Macs are a sizable segment of computers in hands of important people, they are targeted by malware all right. reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparent> every SEO trick, every spam attack is spearheaded against them. Sure, but also they're ignoring extremely basic issues. \"every SEO trick\" is one thing, \"just copy the SO content and still get ranked on the first page\" is them not caring. We can worry about them dealing with the complex issues after they address the low hanging fruit. reply johnnyanmac 6 hours agoparentprevI've been curious for a while too and I've been trying to de-google myself a tiny bit each year (more or less dropped Chrome in 2023). Once I actually grab a full time job again I wouldn't mind grabbing my own subscription here to try it out. I'm curious if 300 searches/month is truly enough for me, though. And what would happen if I go over that rate. Am I simply unable to search more for that month? reply licebmi__at__ 3 hours agorootparentFwiw, I initially burned through the free searches in a few days, so definitely not enough IMO. Add the fact that free searches never got refreshed for my account, and I was pretty much unable to properly test the service for months. But bangs still work after the limit, thus I kept it as default given that I heavily use bangs to search other services. Still I ended up subscribing, and after properly testing, I can recommend. The service is good, the blacklist feature is essential to me now; is just that the free tier is shit. reply spondyl 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, once you hit the free limit, you get served a subscription wall once you try to do a search reply solarkraft 8 hours agoparentprevDoes it have an option to exclude commercial websites? That'd be quite useful to me. Pretty much every time I try to find information about a product, all I find are sites trying to sell it to me (but I already have it and want to find information about it, damn it!). reply layoric 8 hours agorootparentAnother Kagi user here, yes, the customization of results is way better than any other search engine I've used. Eg, personalization can be manually set to lower or raise weight of results from specific domains. This has become extremely useful to not only filter out bad sites, but increase relevant results when you regularly get information from sites like GitHub etc. Stats are released about these as well so you can easily copy heavy used fiters [0]. [0] https://kagi.com/stats?stat=leaderboard reply greenmartian 5 hours agorootparentInteresting that HN is pinned way more than stackoverflow. reply unshavedyak 8 hours agorootparentprevIirc there is an exclude (or at the very least, weights), though you'd have to do it by hand. Though i do think there is a social feature to install other peoples weights. reply lucasban 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is a lens available in settings that seems like a good fit, though I haven’t tried it myself yet. Small Web: results that favor noncommercial domains and topics. reply LargeTomato 8 hours agoparentprevI just signed up. You get 100 searches for free to try it out. reply justinclift 5 hours agorootparentSmall warning. If you click the \"more\" button at the bottom of a list of results, it silently does another search and deducts that from your remaining free searches. reply hunter-gatherer 7 hours agorootparentprevI did that a couple months ago, and just signed up for a paid tier after I tried to go back to duckduckgo and started losing my mind. Kagi is better for discovering new content and mediocre places on the internet. reply irfn 8 hours agoparentprevThe question to about the obvious quality drop for Google is, Is this intentional? Perhaps some cost saving or ROI measures? Or the motive always was to just train their AI and we just helped with that? reply tempest_ 7 hours agorootparentJust perverse incentives. Google isn't incentivized to be a good search engine. They are incentivized to be just good enough that you don't go elsewhere while increasing the number of ads / paid results. reply Kerrick 9 hours agoprevAs a Kagi customer, I hope their choice to allocate nearly a third of their investor-raised funds to produce and freely distribute 20,000 t-shirts doesn’t lead to their demise. reply NelsonMinar 8 hours agoparentFor anyone else wondering, they raised $670,000 from 42 small investors in June 2023. Non-traditional fundraise. I agree that spending that money on t-shirts is weird. As a new Kagi subscriber I don't want a t-shirt. I want a thriving search engine. https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round reply paxcoder 8 hours agorootparentSuggestion for Kagi: If you haven't made the t-shirts yet, offer users to request/reserve one first. That way you won't ship to those who don't want it (though you won't ship to some who do, so maybe save some t-shirts on the side for those willing to contact you to ask if there's any left after the deadline) reply al_borland 4 hours agorootparentReading the blog post it sounds like users will get a credit toward a free shirt/stickers. They will still need to pay shipping, which should be enough to keep people from getting it just for the hell of it. After a period of time, if there are unclaimed shirts they will open them up to those users beyond the first 20k. While it sounds like they will print 20k no matter what, it doesn’t seem like they will randomly ship them out to users. They really can’t, as they don’t have the addresses of all their users. reply yellow_lead 1 hour agorootparentIf they will print 20k no matter what, I'm curious how they'll determine what sizes to print. reply jks 13 minutes agorootparent\"Sizes are first come first serve\" so I suppose they estimate how many of each size they need and then let people get a shirt as long as their size is available. reply Vegenoid 8 hours agoparentprevEspecially ones that do not have their name. As someone who has heard about Kagi, but not actually visited their site or used it, I had no idea they had a dog mascot. If I saw one of those shirts in the wild, and I hadn’t just read this post and seen the pictures of the shirts, I would have had no idea it was a Kagi shirt. reply outlore 8 hours agorootparentHaving received many t shirts from companies and conferences, I mostly don't wear them if the branding is really over the top. As described, a Kagi shirt would be something I'd actually wear reply SOLAR_FIELDS 8 hours agorootparentThere was a hilarious blog post on here a few months ago from some guy who collects database company T shirts. A lot of them are quite bad but a few are really good. IIRC his favorite was from Snowflake. Edit: apparently his favorite was from mongo: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2016/07/my-favorite-datab... which I have to agree with, that is a good shirt. I think I might still like the Snowflake one (3) the best though. Although rereading the article he says there is writing on the back of the Snowflake one which makes me not like it as much. There are very few stylish shirts I enjoy that have writing on the back of them. reply 3PS 4 hours agorootparentFor reference, that \"some guy\" is Andy Pavlo, a professor of databases at Carnegie Mellon. He has a lot of neat writeups online, like this annual review of new database systems [0]. He puts up lectures on the internet for free too. Having been to Dr. Pavlo's office - or at least, one of them - I can attest to there being multiple cardboard boxes filled with gifted shirts from different companies. One of my favorite designs was actually from CMU's DB group itself - it has a little \"this database kills fascists\" tag on it, with a skull motif :D [0]: https://ottertune.com/blog/2022-databases-retrospective reply thfuran 8 hours agorootparentprevBut would that make it effective advertising? reply diggan 8 hours agorootparentBut isn't the goal of the t-shirt a gift for the first 20k paying users? The goal for them doesn't seem to be about what they get back from giving away the t-shirt. reply justinclift 5 hours agorootparentThat sounds pretty silly. Shouldn't gifts and similar things come after the business is properly sustainable? reply outlore 8 hours agorootparentprevI suppose it wouldn't! Perhaps it might develop brand awareness. (I am thinking about Nike's swoosh or Vercel's triangle) reply pseudocomposer 7 hours agorootparentprevI’ve used Kagi as my default search engine for months and wasn’t aware it had a dog mascot either! I’ll probably turn the shirt into some word-of-mouth marketing at my gym, so I wouldn’t say my free shirt is a terrible investment. reply smsm42 8 hours agorootparentprevLooked at the shirt, it looks pretty nice. Definitely something I'd wear and not feel like I am a walking ad. reply rbits 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, no one's going to wear a shirt that says Kagi on it. They'll wear a shirt with the mascot on it though reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparentYou're way too sure about other people's choices. I'd totally wear one. reply ambrose2 8 hours agorootparentprevI definitely would, I generally don’t wear graphic t’s. reply malwrar 8 hours agoparentprevIs kagi’s financial status that dire? Call me stupid, but I’m excited to get the shirt and feel warmly about the fact that the leadership at Kagi might actually be thinking about their early users the way described in the blog post. The $200k probably will not pay itself back from the shirts themselves, but I’m definitely going to shill kagi much harder now. reply jackjeff 7 hours agorootparentI don’t know. Might have been worth it just for the exposure on Hacker News. reply viraptor 6 hours agoparentprevI feel like many people here missed: > When the merch store goes live in about 8 weeks It may be a part of a bigger commitment / batch. They'll sell more in the future with some extra income, so that should even out anyway. reply EasyMark 8 hours agoparentprevI'm no bean counter, but that would have been a huge no from me. reply lolc 8 hours agoparentprevMay be a sign that they don't need those funds badly. reply duck 8 hours agoparentprevMy duckduckgo t-shirt has converted a lot of people over the last 13 years, but if it doesn't have the name that seems like a big miss! reply _benj 9 hours agoparentprevhehe! I see it as great marketing, possibly decreasing churn (although Kagi subscribers seem among the most enthusiastic I've seen around!) and just generally continuing with the tred of goodwill towards users (the opposite of the usual treatment of users from big tech) reply fuddle 8 hours agorootparentThe t-shirt doesn't have their name on it. I don't see how it will help spread their brand. reply lucasban 8 hours agorootparentIt’s likely to lead to more real world discussions of the product, someone is bound to ask what the shirt is about, or you might feel more motivated to talk about it while wearing it. reply djha-skin 8 hours agoparentprevThey might think it's free advertising, but I only wear t-shirts to bed or on the weekends and vacations. Most of the time I wear button-ups or polos. Them sending me a free t-shirt isn't going to get them as much advertising as they hoped for. reply jcul 2 hours agorootparentIt depends on the t-shirt though, how it looks, the quality. I've got to say those t-shirts look great. reply dinkleberg 9 hours agoparentprevYeah it’s definitely an interesting move reply dgacmu 8 hours agoparentprevIt feels more to me like they're giving a month (and a bit?) free service in the form of a T-shirt. At this point, their 2023 raise was \"only\" about three months of gross revenue. Shipped, the tshirts are probably, eh, $13 USD? I don't really have an opinion about whether this is an effective advertising spend or not. I hope they follow up. I don't need another free T-shirt but I'll probably wear it, I like the doggo. reply throwaway0665 8 hours agoparentprevI didn't realize they'd even raised any money. I thought they were immune from all the VC enshittification. reply dharmab 8 hours agorootparentThey raised from small investors and interested users, not VC reply nickphx 8 hours agoparentprevI didn't see published costs on the link, but it did mention the shirts were produced in Serbia...

But Kagi is missing an opportunity for a huge brand awareness campaign from this. People who are already really happy with Kagi would become brand ambassadors. Why isn’t the name ‘Kagi’ found anywhere on the t-shirt design? People who want to know where it’s from would have to go out of the way to ask the tee wearer. reply cdata 8 hours agoparentFWIW I'm way more likely to wear a t-shirt that doesn't have the word \"Kagi\" on it. reply themadturk 6 hours agorootparentI'm not much for graphic tees either, but doggo is cute, and I'd wear one. reply Terretta 8 hours agorootparentprevTo what end? reply frakkingcylons 8 hours agorootparentIt's just a matter of each person's taste. I also prefer it without the name (or any text really). reply afthonos 7 hours agorootparentprevNot GP, but…to wear clothes? Most people don’t wear clothes for any other end. reply jhardy54 8 hours agorootparentprevYep, honestly their black shirt with the dog on the back is kind of cool, but the corny “Humanize the web!” on the sternum ruined it for me. reply al_borland 4 hours agoparentprevMaybe that’s by design. If someone sees “Kagi” on the shirt they may look it up, not get it, and move on. If instead the dog acts as an ice breaker, “cute dog,” then the person wearing it can mention what it is, but more importantly, why they like and use it. I’d also be much more likely to wear a shirt without a URL on it. I’ve been gifted shirts with URLs before, I have never and will never wear them in public. reply rcdemski 8 hours agoprevI signed up a month ago and this is the first time something “not Google” has stuck for me.

Especially when you have aren't a household name yet. It's weak advertising... reply al_borland 4 hours agoparentFor me, I’m much more likely to actually wear a shirt if it doesn’t have the brand plastered on it as a blatant marketing tool. And if people have to ask about the shirt, that opens up the conversation to talk about Kagi. If the name is just on there, I think fewer people would say anything, and I feel like it really needs an explanation from a user. Paying for a search engine isn’t something most people will do without someone giving them a reason why they should care. reply wakawaka28 3 hours agorootparentI almost never wear graphic tees. But to me it seems like there are people too shy or uninterested to ask about a generic cartoon character on a shirt. The name doesn't have to be so bold, but it shouldn't be in fine print either. I think the logo is not cute enough either. The grungy sketch style is not as appealing as normal clean logos. I think they need to seek help in designing an appropriate logo. At least the name Kagi is catchy. reply pcchristie 8 hours agoprevIt's funny, Kagi has almost been worth it just to allow me to prioritise Wikipedia results which for literally 80-90% of my searches is all I'm really looking for.

I haven’t changed my iPhone back, but feel like I should do something there, as it’s a bit inconsistent. I used Firefox for while, as it has support for adding any search engine possible, natively.

There is also Yandex, which is identical to Google's old search engine. By the end of 2023, the search quality of Duckduckgo and Bing have dropped. DuckDuckGo is also now directing me to scroll through rubbish on the front page \"Explore our features\", so I moved to Startpage completely. reply nomilk 8 hours agoprevI've long been suspicious that google doesn't want you to get an answer too quickly, or you'll go off google and back to whatever you were previously doing, thus they furnish you fewer ads and make less ad revenue.

One month I threw them an extra $10 or $20, as I was costing them more than I paid, even at $10/month. The goal should be profitability and sustainability, not user count. It’s not a social media site where the number of users should matter. The hardest hurdle is getting people to pay anything. Even 1 cent would be difficult, as it requires a sign up and adding payment information. reply mminer237 7 hours agoparentprevAnd they would be losing money with every user then. It costs them way more than that just to pay Google and Microsoft their fees. reply Exoristos 6 hours agorootparentHow does that work? They have a contractual obligation to report to Microsoft and Google how many individual IPs have accessed Kagi domains and pay accordingly? reply darekkay 2 hours agorootparentNo, they pay per search query. 200k users make statistically 10 times as many queries as 20k users. reply davkan 4 hours agoprevHonestly I just pay for kagi because i find google to be a despicable company and every other search alternative is trash.

I don't support what the Brave founder did, but there are probably 100+ people there that don't think that way and are just working and living their lives, and since Brave doesn't have any stance one way or another, it's just another company with a service to me. So is Kagi reply Zetobal 8 hours agorootparentI don't fucking care about politics and I am tired of it being brought up when I am explicitly talking about the quality of search. So please stop injecting your \"Just take the L because of my political agenda attitude\" and talk about the product. The whole discussion got so political on their discord and forum that you can't even talk about the degraded quality before some left or right wing nut comes around going \"AKSCHUALLY\". I do care about the search results and they got worse and are not deterministic anymore since they started using brave. Maybe it's omething else they changed in the code but I expect to at least see the first results of a previous search on the page when I search for it again a few days later. Especially when it was a helpful result. It's useless for me now. reply ahkurtz 8 hours agorootparentI started subscribing in like October and haven't been searching much since the new year cause I've been really busy. I think I have also noticed this quality degradation, and also the results taking much longer. I'm not gonna say it's useless but I understand. So I can dislike it for that reason with you. As far as politics... for a lot of people not relying on a single particular global megacorp (who tend to extend the soft-power of a given state or economic bloc) for access to information is a semi-political choice. There is very much an inescapable concern of \"who chooses what I get to see and what are their incentives\" that can't really be reduced to \"I don't care about politics\". It cannot be separated from politics, which is why people have such strong feelings about it. I'm not sure that's what people really mean though, I think they talk past each other a lot on this topic. No disrespect meant to you and I appreciate your comments. I really like the idea that they'd hedge and not give any single index overwhelming leverage over what Kagi users are fed, and conveniently for me (who does care a bit about the who of the thing) if they stick to that approach it should provide more diversity of contemporaneous political messaging... so it can also please the (I think somewhat tedious) \"no politics\" crowd at the same time. So that seems good? Tradeoffs maybe, and give them some more time to figure it out, incorporate more indices? reply tremarley 8 hours agoparentprevThey use brave API? reply acdha 8 hours agorootparentYes.

    "commentBody": "Ollama releases Python and JavaScript Libraries (ollama.ai)308 points by adamhowell 7 hours agohidepastfavorite69 comments filleokus 15 minutes agoAn off topic question: Is there such a thing as a \"small-ish language model\". A model that you could simple give instructions / \"capabilities\" which a user can interact with. Almost like Siri-level of intelligence. Imagine you have an API-endpoint where you can set the level of some lights and you give the chat a system prompt explaining how to build the JSON body of the request, and the user can prompt it with stuff like \"Turn off all the lights\" or \"Make it bright in the bedroom\" etc. How low could the memory consumption of such a model be? We don't need to store who the first kaiser of Germany was, \"just\" enough to kinda map human speech onto available API's. reply ivanfioravanti 3 hours agoprevI posted about the Python library few hours after release. Great experience. Easy, fast and works well.

I can see that you are loading a train.jsonl file and the some instructions but is the output model generated or this is some kind of a new way of training the models? reply rgbrgb 7 hours agoprevAre these libraries for connecting to an ollama service that the user has already installed or do they work without the user installing anything? Sorry for not checking the code but maybe someone has the same question here. I looked at using ollama when I started making FreeChat [0] but couldn't figure out a way to make it work without asking the user to install it first (think I asked in your discord at the time). I wanted FreeChat to be 1-click install from the mac app store so I ended up bundling the llama.cpp server instead which it runs on localhost for inference. At some point I'd love to swap it out for ollama and take advantage of all the cool model pulling stuff you guys have done, I just need it to be embeddable. My ideal setup would be importing an ollama package in swift which would start the server if the user doesn't already have it running. I know this is just js and python to start but a dev can dream :) Either way, congrats on the release!

I don't have the service installed on my computer RN, but I assume the former works because it by default uses a host (localhost) and port number that is also the default for ollma service? reply flakes 3 hours agorootparentExactly that. Client host options default, https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/blob/main/ollama/_cl... Also overrideable with OLLAMA_HOST env var.

But, I’ll ask nevertheless. Local LLMs are great! But, it would be more useful once we can _easily_ throw our own data for them to use as reference or even as a source of truth. This is where it opens doors that a closed system like OpenAI cannot - I’m never going to upload some data to ChatGPT for them to train on. Could Ollama make it easier and standardize the way to add documents to local LLMs? I’m not talking about uploading one image or model and asking a question about it. I’m referring to pointing a repository of 1000 text files and asking LLMs questions based on their contents. reply sciolist 1 hour agoparentThere's two main ways to \"add documents to LLMs\" - using documents in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and training/finetuning models. I believe you can use RAG with Ollama, however Ollama doesn't do the training of models. reply emmanueloga_ 2 hours agoparentprevI don’t know if Ollama can do this but https://gpt4all.io/ can. reply jampekka 1 hour agoparentprevSounds like Retrieval Augmented Generation.

Great UI reply nbbaier 2 hours agoparentprevWhat's the product? reply sqs 6 hours agoprevI posted about my awesome experiences using Ollama a few months ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37662915. Ollama is definitely the easiest way to run LLMs locally, and that means it’s the best building block for applications that need to use inference. It’s like how Docker made it so any application can execute something kinda portably kinda safely on any machine. With Ollama, any application can run LLM inference on any machine. Since that post, we shipped experimental support in our product for Ollama-based local inference. We had to write our own client in TypeScript but will probably be able to switch to this instead. reply keyle 5 hours agoparentCould you maybe compare it to llama.cpp? All it took for me to get going is `make` and I basically have it working locally as a console app. reply coder543 5 hours agorootparentOllama is built around llama.cpp, but it automatically handles templating the chat requests to the format each model expects, and it automatically loads and unloads models on demand based on which model an API client is requesting. Ollama also handles downloading and caching models (including quantized models), so you just request them by name. Recently, it got better (though maybe not perfect yet) at calculating how many layers of any model will fit onto the GPU, letting you get the best performance without a bunch of tedious trial and error. Similar to Dockerfiles, ollama offers Modelfiles that you can use to tweak the existing library of models (the parameters and such), or import gguf files directly if you find a model that isn’t in the library. Ollama is the best way I’ve found to use LLMs locally. I’m not sure how well it would fare for multiuser scenarios, but there are probably better model servers for that anyways. Running “make” on llama.cpp is really only the first step. It’s not comparable. reply palmfacehn 5 hours agorootparentThis is interesting. I wouldn't have given the project a deeper look without this information. The lander is ambiguous. My immediate takeaway was, \"Here's yet another front end promising ease of use.\" reply baq 3 hours agorootparentI had similar feelings but last week finally tried it in WSL2. Literally two shell commands and a largish download later I was chatting with mixtral on an aging 1070 at a positively surprising tokens/s (almost reading speed, kinda like the first chatgpt). Felt like magic. reply regularfry 1 hour agorootparentprevFor me, the critical thing was that ollama got the GPU offload for Mixtral right on a single 4090, where vLLM consistently failed with out of memory issues. It's annoying that it seems to have its own model cache, but I can live with that. reply wokwokwok 4 hours agorootparentprevnext [3 more] [flagged] coder543 4 hours agorootparent> comes with a heavy runtime (node or python) Ollama does not come with (or require) node or python. It is written in Go. If you are writing a node or python app, then the official clients being announced here could be useful, but they are not runtimes, and they are not required to use ollama. This very fundamental mistake in your message indicates to me that you haven’t researched ollama enough. If you’re going to criticize something, it is good to research it more. > does not expose the full capability of llama.cpp As far as I’ve been able to tell, Ollama also exposes effectively everything llama.cpp offers. Maybe my use cases with llama.cpp weren’t advanced enough? Please feel free to list what is actually missing. Ollama allows you to deeply customize the parameters of models being served. I already acknowledged that ollama was not a solution for every situation. For running on your own desktop, it is great. If you’re trying to deploy a multiuser LLM server, you probably want something else. If you’re trying to build a downloadable application, you probably want something else. reply golergka 4 hours agorootparentprevHow much of a performance overhead does this runtime add, anyway? Each request to a model would eat so much GPU for actual text generation, the cost to process the request and response strings even in a slow, garbage-collected seems negligible both in latency. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevFor me the big deal with Ollama is the ease of instantly setting up a local inference API. I've got a beefy machine with a GPU downstairs, but Ollama allows me to easily use it from a Raspberry Pi on the main floor. reply sqs 6 hours agoparentprevAlso one feature request - if the library (or another related library) could also transparently spin up a local Ollama instance if the user doesn’t have one already. “Transparent-on-demand-Ollama” or something. reply chown 5 hours agorootparentI have been working on something similar to that in Msty [1].

They also do it without clarifying their involvement, which could come across as astroturfing. Self promotion sometimes (not all the time) is fine, but it should also be clearly stated as such.

    "originLink": "https://unethical.info/2024/01/24/hacking-my-air-purifier/",
    "originBody": "Unethical Info Menu Close Breaking Free from DRM: The Story of Hacking My Air Purifier I searched the web for a deal on a decent air purifier and the Xiaomi 4 Pro seemed to meet all my requirements. The filter size, scheduler and air volume ticked all the boxes. I set it up and thought nothing of it until last week my room was lit with the ‘0% remaining’ replace filter warning. I had set my unit up to disable the LCD so this was an unwelcome surprise. I dismissed the warning by clicking the user button to dismiss the error and 15 minutes later it lit up my room again… There was nowhere in the app I could disable the warning, having cleaned the filter several times throughout the year I was sure it had at least another 12 months of life left in it. I decided to investigate the nightmare DRM RFID chip that was stuck to the bottom of my filter. Grifters and Gatekeepers: As I reached for my proxmark I realized that surely someone had already done the heavy lifting, I was partially correct. Introducing Flamingo Tech he had spent some time reverse engineering these filters and publishing his work. In his repo he outlines the important blocks from the tag: Block 8 back to 00000000, it’s back to 100% Other block info: Block4 is rfid-factory-id Block5 is rfid-product-id (xx:xx:xx:xx Regular Filter) Block6: rfid-time Block7: rfid-serial-num Unfortunately the NfcA tag is still locked and we can’t edit the tag without the password. Thankfully the proxmark community had already tackled this. You can review their process in discovering their password key gen here. Flamingo Tech published a script written by Doegox outlining how the password crack works. Despite the title “This is how they do it!” he fails to explain the code within the post and uses the blog as a call to action to sell his own tags. Normally this sort of thing doesn’t bother me but the comment “This will significantly decrease the waste footprint from a whole filter.. to just a sticker 😀” rubbed me the wrong way. If he really cared about the carbon footprint he would have explained how to update the tag already on the filter you own. However if you want to support his work you can still grab his stickers here. I decided to explain the code here but if you want to skip to the actual filter reset scroll down to “Hacking the tag”. Password Key Gen: The script contains two examples, the first example is based on the tag UID “04A03CAA1E7080” resulting in the password “CD91AFCC”. First we take the UID and convert it to a byte array. So 04A03CAA1E7080 becomes a sequence of bytes [04, A0, 3C, AA, 1E, 70, 80]. Next the SHA-1 hash function is applied to this byte array which gives us bcaf806333ccf720cd441a167f914fbe6ea4a513 which is converted to a byte array as we need only 4 bytes from this string to form the password. Using the first byte in the array “BC” we convert it to decimal to get 188 and use that byte to determine where each byte is within the hash. The calculated indices are: 188 % 20 = 8 (188 + 5) % 20 = 13 (188 + 13) % 20 = 1 (188 + 17) % 20 = 5 Now back to that hash we generated earlier – bcaf806333ccf720cd441a167f914fbe6ea4a513 Grabbing the bytes in the correct order we get: 8th byte: CD 13th byte: 91 1st byte: AF 5th byte: CC Concatenating these forms the password: CD91AFCC Now that we know how it works we can modify/reset our own filters. Not everyone has access to a ~$350 Proxmark so I’ve created instructions for updating your tag with any NFC enabled mobile phone. Hacking the tag: Step 1: Install NFC tools for your NFC enabled Android or iPhone. Step 2: Scan the NFC tag on the bottom of your filter with the read function of the free app. Step 3: Copy the retrieved ‘Serial Number/UID’ (14 character hex value) down somewhere. Step 4: Generate your reset command by entering the 14 characters below. If the UID is 12345678901234 the password will be 011853E8 and the command to reset the filter will be: 1B011853E8,3008,A20800000000 UID to Password Converter Enter UID: Generate Reset Command Step 5: In the main menu of the app click ‘Other’ -> ‘Advanced NFC commands’ and accept the disclaimer. Then paste the command above into the data box. (NOTE: Android users will have to select the I/O class which will be “NfcA (ISO 14443-3A)” from the drop down menu) Step 6: Ensure the top of the phone is sitting over the tag and click ‘Send Command’ Voila! You’ve successfully reset your filter. Repeat as needed for continuous, hassle-free air purification.

The unit continues working fine without it, with no further complaints. At least on the 3H model. I think the main point of the RFID tag is mainly to prevent sellers from selling either fake, or even worse, selling cleaned but used filters as new. So when you use the air purifier with a filter without the RFID tag, it just throws a warning the first time and then just works™. As a user it's important to know that you have an authentic, original (and new) HEPA filter. So while it's a cool hack, I really hope that this doesn't result in a flood of low quality counterfeit filters on the market. reply steve_rambo 3 hours agoparentThere are many clones with RFID tags that get accepted as originals. They're even being sold as clones with generic brand names or no brand name at all. If the tag is there to prove that you've bought an authentic filter, it's not doing that very well. reply userbinator 6 hours agoprevAll this complex user-hostility for a fan with a filter. Just like with ink cartridges that only count and don't have any actual sensors, they could make an air purifier which has a differential pressure sensor to tell you how much the filter is really clogged, like many HVAC systems have, and even vacuum cleaners (some work entirely mechanically), but then they wouldn't be able to squeeze more $$$ out of the users. reply lispisok 4 hours agoparentWith air purifiers I blame the consumer doing it to themselves.

Fundamentally you can make more money by overcharging for consumables and undercharging for the product itself, than you can by \"fairly\" charging for both.

I didn't have to do it with mine. Be aware that at least some brother lasers you have to replace another part every 10,000 sheets, which is the duration of two to five toner replacements. I am unsure if it's the heater or the laser or what. reply api 6 hours agorootparentprevI've seen this strategy in airline ticket pricing too. If you fly a few times you figure out that some airlines appear cheap but they're just deferring the cost to later for luggage, seats, and amenities. It's unavoidable that if customers have behavior X, such as tending to go for the cheapest thing, sellers in the market will develop clever strategies to game that behavior. Retailers go so far as to research how the colors, shapes, and surface textures of packaging affect buying behavior, so of course they are also going to intensively study customer price sensitivity behavior too. I've learned that with a lot of things such as appliances, tools, and some electronics it's actually cheaper to buy the higher-end model. It's cheaper to buy one good one than two or three pieces of junk that break easily. reply 76SlashDolphin 2 hours agorootparentBut in the case of budget airlines you don't have to pay any extra fees if you can correctly manoeuvre around the website. As someone who can easily travel in a shoebox with just a backpack 99% of the time, I appreciate the fact I can save some money by foregoing extras I won't need.

I don't want any kind of computer either. The filter should slide/pop in and there should be a power switch that has maybe 2 to 3 speeds. reply lannisterstark 4 hours agorootparentEh, I guess I'll disagree. Automations allow me to run the purifier at Medium/High speed for certain times a day, even when I am not around. Other than that, they are always on Auto - so they produce minimal noise. However, certain times a day for period of 15-30 mins or so, they run at Medium/High so they can do certain number of air changes in a room of x SQFT. Having a 'computer' also allows them to detect when a room suddenly becomes less 'sanitized' and ramp up the 'automatic' to an appropriate level. reply alpaca128 1 hour agorootparentAutomating based on time has been possible for decades with a simple timer that switches the power for the device. Still no computer necessary. And at least my purifier thinks 100% of the time that the air is perfectly clean no matter what, so in auto mode it would never run anyway. reply vintermann 1 hour agorootparentprevIndoor environment geeks run their own air purifiers put together from PC fans and oven filters. Apparently PC fans designed for it are much less noisy than the commercial alternatives, so you can run it on constant speed.

I'm that close to do the same for my child's nightlight: just shunt power around whatever is opening the circuit and drive it with a Shelly plug. (Okay the grand idea would be to ultimately put an ESP32 between the control unit and the three buttons, so that I can both operate it manually yet have full control of the thing; not the least because if you cut power it resets its state to a static white light. Never done that so that'd be nice way to acquire the skill without much risk to that super cheap device) reply userbinator 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat value do membrane switches add? \"sleek\" \"modern\" \"futuristic\" \"design\" reply sokoloff 6 hours agorootparentprevCheap and quite amenable to automated assembly. reply graphe 7 hours agoparentprevThere isn't any rational reason that an AC motor with a few resistors/potentiometer with a filter isn't the cheapest. DRM would involve DC power which means a transformer is required as well. Unless there was a good reason to have a DC motor, this wouldn't even be an issue for anyone who can combine a box fan with a filter. I was building a DIY filter and took apart a purifier and was disappointed at it not having DC for me to connect my esp to for a sensor to check the purity. reply wging 5 hours agorootparent“DRM” means “digital rights management” in this context; it has little to do with the choice of AC or DC power. What acronym did you interpret it as? reply graphe 5 hours agorootparentDRM as you used it. There is no DRM AFAIK that works on AC power. It needs binary and that needs at least a transformer. reply p0w3n3d 3 hours agoparentprevI wouldn't call it DRM because there are no digital rights here to manage.

Why did it say it couldn't filter? If his house is dusty, and he cleaned it there's probably dust that isn't visible, he hacked the drm but he also looked for the \"best air filter\" and found this instead of a fan with some filters on it with no verification.

Obviously HEPA filters do expire eventually, but there's a perverse incentive here for the warning to undershoot the actual useful life of the filter. reply mackal 8 hours agorootparentAll of these sort of things are just based on hours used. It's like looking at your hot water heater warranty and replacing it when it's over (I live an an area where the PPM of the water is rather high and hot water heater warranties are basically calibrated for water like mine, so we do have to replace them on warranty expiration, most places you at least get a few years or double) reply bluefirebrand 8 hours agorootparent> It's like looking at your hot water heater warranty and replacing it when it's over Why would anyone do that? Seems like a waste of a hot water heater that probably has a lot of life left. People that do this probably throw out food the moment it hits the best before date too. reply dylan604 3 hours agorootparentChanging a hot water prematurely is probable less expensive than having one blow the bottom out and flood whatever area it is in. I don't have a basement, so my central unit and water heater share a utility closet in the hallway sharing a wall with a bedroom. It's a pretty bad design flaw, as during the summer of 110°+ temps, it is unnecessarily heating the house. IR temp shows that shared wall from the bedroom side over 90° radiating into that bedroom.reply genewitch 28 minutes agorootparentalso they make hybrid water heaters that will cool whatever space they are in while they heat the water using a heat pump on top reply mythhabit 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's not so much a design failure of the house, as it is a heater that is not sufficiently insulated. reply c_o_n_v_e_x 10 hours agorootparentprev>but there's a perverse incentive here for the warning to undershoot the actual useful life of the filter Hypothetically, yes, there's a perverse incentive, but is that what is actually happening? A clogged filter can stress the fan motor which can A) increase power consumption and B)reduce overall product life. reply bonzini 8 hours agorootparentIt's not unlikely. A while ago I had to deal with a laser printer that automatically reported the end of the drum's life after 15000 pages or so, even if there were no signs of stripes on the printed pages. The solution was to stick a 220 ohm resistor on the electric contacts between the drum and the rest of the printer. The printer would sense the resistor (which is present on genuine new drums too) as a signal to reset the page counter. Once the resistor gives a puff of smoke it can be removed, and the old drum can be used until its true end of life. reply j16sdiz 5 hours agorootparentWhat does it take to burn a resistor? It sounds terrible to me. Guess it was hot all the time? reply c_o_n_v_e_x 4 hours agorootparentDepends on the wattage/power rating of the resistor reply bonzini 3 hours agorootparentIt was a through-hole 1/4W resistor. It burnt in about 5 seconds as far as I remember. reply typh00n 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd it is for the consumer to decide which path to take. Not the product itself. reply graphe 8 hours agorootparentprevThe whole device is a product and experience. He disabled the razor saying he couldn't use his razor blade. You're supposed touse it until it goes to zero and replace as instructed. If you want a speaker you don't buy Sonos and say I turned off the drm, firmware and added a headphone jack. If you want filtered air for cheap you buy a box fan with HEPA. reply steve_rambo 3 hours agoparentprevAir purifiers do not filter dust and should never be bought for that purpose. > You don't just clean a filter and say I KNOW there is 12 months more. You do, I have been using two for about 6 years, and you can easily get at least 3-4× runtime out of authentic filters. I refer to external particulate matter sensors and ignore whatever the purifiers themselves are showing. You can also easily clean the filter with hot water, it removes any smells and has no effect on its purifying performance (again, using a couple of external sensors as reference). reply graphe 2 hours agorootparentAre you using HEPA filters?

I have some that are washable but none of them are HEPA. reply vintermann 1 hour agorootparentprev> Air purifiers do not filter dust and should never be bought for that purpose. What? What do you call the particles it filters, if not dust? Of course you can do with a prefilter which filters out larger dust particles so they don't clog your finer filter.

Then I'd love a writeup on hacking the sensor to check PPM or change the percentages or to tell you when to replace it. If someone does their research, and still buys a proprietary system that sells you expensive filters and has drm, AND chooses to get this device they must have a really good reason or aren't very smart. reply andreareina 6 hours agorootparentThe filters being DRMd was not on my bingo card when I bought my unit. Maybe that was naïve of me. But also proprietary is all that's available here. (To be clear I'm not the author, I just have an air purifier from the same seller) reply graphe 6 hours agorootparentOh I didn't mean you, I think your device would be an appropriate or ideal hacking target with the PPM. I was referring to the OP who supposedly did their research and bought it anyway. I thought you had a different device. It's surprising that your device has the reading and it would have been a great read if it was hacked to display the air pressure to gauge the longevity.

If your home is indeed \"dust free\" you wouldn't need this filter (and cleaning it won't clear the small things you probably want to filter, water also damages the filter).

It's fine for the software to warn him of things. It's not fine for the software to enforce filter changing policy as if it was his boss. He can ignore and dismiss the warning if he wants, simply because he's the human and the machine is supposed to bend over backwards to conform to his will. There really is no need for any further justification. reply ajb 10 hours agoprevThese filters probably do really age out, though perhaps more slowly than the DRM There is a mechanical filter that will be cleanable, but the HEPA filter works by having an injected electrostatic charge which will leak away over time, and the activated carbon will deactivate over time.

It was based on a web survey by DX (love them by the way), that had 219 completed responses and asked likert scale (1-5) questions about how they felt. Good developer experience increases self-reported productivity. I do suspect that it correlates with actual productivity and business outcomes, especially around reducing the productivity loss that comes from error remediation. reply geekjock 16 hours agoparentI'm one of the co-authors of the study. Your critique is valid though by research standards, for this type of study, our sample is sufficient. We are planning to replicate this study on a larger scale in the future, though! reply datadrivenangel 16 hours agorootparentI do love to see more research here, thank you! Having done internal developer & analyst tooling work (and used DX), this type of survey is great for internal prioritization when you have dedicated capacity for improvements. I'd be curious to see more about organizational outcomes, as this is piece of DevOps/DevEx data that I feel is weakest and requires the most faith. DORA did some research here, but it's still not always enough to convince leadership. reply geekjock 16 hours agorootparentAgreed with this. We're working on it! reply vlovich123 16 hours agorootparentprevAre there any plans to figure out objective ways to measure productivity and what distinguishes “good devex” from “bad devex”? I’ve worked at a lot of big tech companies that do surveys about internal tooling and every year it’s rated as a weak spot, across years and companies this seemed like a consistent trend. And yet everyone had teams dedicated to improving various aspects of devex so it’s unclear if these teams are just improving the wrong things or if productivity really is improving and it’s something else (eg the amount of code debt grows faster than devex improvements or people are asked to go faster than the devex improvements can keep up or the devex is being improved but the size of the survey means not enough people feel it because you optimize smaller subsets of engineering orgs). That’s another thing to be mindful about large scale and small scale surveys - the latter might be sampling specific teams adopting the tool whereas the former might find there’s no way to make everyone happy and it all turns into a wash. reply geekjock 16 hours agorootparent\"Are there any plans to figure out objective ways to measure productivity\" You can't measure developer productivity objectively, assuming you're referring to metrics like lines of code, number of pull requests, or velocity points which are infamous.

Here are some examples: https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-develop... \"... and what distinguishes 'good devex' from 'bad devex'\" Yes to this.

There's broad agreement on this both within the research community as well as practitioners at leading tech companies. No those are metrics you’re suggesting. There are better ones as someone else mentioned (time to get code from PR to production, some way of measuring the quality of work getting to production, etc). Yes, the obvious metrics are poor and better metrics are difficult to measure and quantify. And obviously no single metric is going to capture something as multidimensional as code development. Also, the link you reference doesn’t support your argument. > Across the board, all companies shared that they use both qualitative and quantitative measures Throughout it discusses that people do use quantitative metrics to help guide their analysis and none of them try to do the obviously naive ones as mentioned. This isn’t intended as a critique, but as an engineering profession anything that isn’t quantifiable means it’s open to interpretation and argument weakening forward progress to be restricted to what becomes adopted as industry standard which is in many ways more of a popularity contest of fads rather than concrete technical improvement. reply geekjock 13 hours agorootparentMakes sense - I agree with you. My mistake on assuming you were referring to metrics like the ones I listed. reply hibikir 16 hours agorootparentprevAsking people whether the developer experience is good or bad is not going to be the most efficient of approaches: It's ultimately asking for a mood. When teams are asked what they are spending a lot of time on than they wish they shouldn't, you can at least see what are the heavier pain points. It doesn't help if your developer experience budget is zero, but it can at least organize the useful alternatives. In most places I've worked at, the a survey asking for specific pain points gets great results, because the worst time sinks stick out like a sore thumb, especially if you have workers that have worked in high quality organizations. reply callalex 13 hours agorootparentprevHaving been on the teams that improve developer experience, the problem is that one of my hands gives while the other takes away. I can address every complaint a developer has about the company platform, but at the same time requirements change. As a company grows they start caring more about security and firewalling between different data and services which makes developing harder and more annoying. reply droopyEyelids 16 hours agorootparentprevFor your first question about good devex, there are definitely some objective ways to measure it. * The time it takes for completed code to be deployed to production * count of manual interventions it takes to get the code deployed * count of other people that have to get involved for a given deploy * how long it takes a new employee to set up their dev environment, count of manual steps involved Stuff like that reply herval 13 hours agoparentprev> Good developer experience increases self-reported productivity. So do ineffective DX, most times. There's \"proper\" way to assess productivity gains that don't rely on subjective self-reporting (eg the DORA metrics). The \"improving feedback loops\" item on this report makes sense on that light - the other two are questionable as a direct proxy reply makeitdouble 10 hours agorootparent> DORA metrics I generally agree with your point, with the caveat that metrics like DORA are the first to be gamed when applied to an organization. It's the usual cycle of applying the metrics first in an informal way, then using it for team/process evaluations as it seems to be somewhat reliable, then teams start to reajust how they make the tickets and the deploy cycle in ways that dramatically increase the metrics while reality hasn't changed much. Analyzing productivity with completely objective metrics will I think always bear these flaws (I'd assume even measuring things at the highest level as \"wages vs revenue\" would be gamed on how wages and revenue are calculated ?) reply herval 9 hours agorootparentwhen applied as a metric, yes - so is any metric that becomes a goal (goodhart's law?). To _assess_ an organization, they're pretty solid reply Paul-Craft 12 hours agorootparentprev> So do ineffective DX, most times. I don't find this hard to believe, but do you know of any research showing this? reply herval 9 hours agorootparentI haven't looked for research tbh, just personal experience. It's kinda hard to prove a negative tbh (how do you organize a research that can measure if something subjectively \"bad\" made people subjectively less effective?). I've been to multiple organizations that invested heavily in DX, and as an external observer you could see they became actually slower (eg one went from test-in-prod and deploy-to-prod to a convoluted CI pipeline) - it made engineers feel like they were doing a lot less work (you just push code and forget), but in reality, an entire department was hired to deal with issues in prod, and the teams didn't really deliver anything faster at all. But 100% of the devs swore it was better/faster/more efficient. On another, the added free time converted directly into more complexity, so tons of overengineered microservices (sometimes to the tune of 2-3x the number of individuals on a team) ensued - it got so easy to do X, everyone overdid it. reply IshKebab 16 hours agoparentprevI agree. I think this is just one of those things that we know is true but can't easily be proven via the scientific method. I expect some HN readers will balk at the idea that we can know things but can't prove them scientifically but only because they haven't really thought about it. E.g. does giving variables sensible names reduce bug counts? Obviously. But it's very difficult to prove even something as obvious as that. reply thaumaturgy 10 hours agorootparentIt's peculiar that \"developer productivity\" is even a term. It doesn't have a generally-agreed-upon definition. I don't think a definition is even possible. So, we keep trying to come up with objective measures of a term that is impossible to objectively measure. Isn't that weird? Why not \"developer happiness\", or, if that's too hippy-dippy for the suits, \"developer satisfaction\"? Surely we can reason that, all other things being equal, happier developers are more productive. Then, surveys like this one make perfect sense. \"Hey, how satisfied are you with the tools / processes / whathaveyou at your employer?\" That's a valid question, and collecting a pile of answers does start to yield some useful insights into what works and what doesn't. But no, we're trying to use \"developer productivity\" instead, as though we're all simple machines that provide value by converting coffee into code, and the winning business is the one that is able to extract the most SLOC out of the cheapest and most miniscule quantity of coffee. reply lioeters 8 hours agorootparentI think in general, that's the industrial-age worldview of the \"suits\", where a business is a money-making machine, with worker productivity measured as an objective quantity, a mechanical force that converts to profit. It's a kind of scientism, a worship of numbers and charts, like economics. reply bloopernova 16 hours agoprevMy role is DevOps but I find myself gravitating towards improving the developer experience, which I think is a worthy subcategory in the DevOps practice. The team I'm on previously didn't have any automated way to set up developer workstations, now we've got an Ansible script that does most of everything they need in less than an hour. (Our VPN is slow as cold molasses) Previously, setup was ad-hoc, leading to troubleshooting questions like \"did you follow instructions in this forwarded email, this one section from a wiki page, and a copy/paste comment in chat?\". Now it's \"did you run the script?\". Similarly, the concept of the \"Internal Developer Platform\" might be interesting to some: https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/core-components/ It's kind of amazing to me that there are whole teams out there that struggle with awful environments that actively put up barriers to efficient coding. reply agumonkey 15 hours agoparentdevops and dx share the same spirit of reducing friction at my job i can't stop leaning toward them because I can count in blood the amount of energy, time and money wasted on the thousands papercuts stacked over time one needs to find a balance of fluidifying the daily logistics involved, it amps up joy and reduce stress.. leaves more time for problem solving and creativity. sadly most devs / managers couldn't care less about that reply jswank 15 hours agoparentprevI've a similar background, and have worked recently w/ a handful of teams with atrocious, self-imposed developer experience.

In my experience what, what works is: 1) Development containers. They're not for every situation, but if they suit your situation (prebuilt base images, private repo, long build times that can be split out into common layers, probably remote dev with a good IDE that natively supports them, i.e. a Jetbrains IDE), they're amazing. They completely remove the need for \"works on my machine\" as you deploy a multi stage built app from the same base container image. 2) Single \"5 step\" setup page. The setup guide should be: Install git/p4, install toolchain with versions, log in, clone, `make build`/`cmake --build` / `npm run dev`. Depending on what you work on, \"run dependencies in a container\" (database, grafana/prometheus, log agent) might be there too. Everyone who is onboarded follows these steps, and their first two tasks, in your teams issue tracker are \"fix anything that didn't work in setup guide\", and \"make a PR\", both of which should happen on day 1/2. reply hotpotamus 16 hours agoparentprevI suppose I could be called DevOps, and I've always seen that as part of the job - making the infrastructure as easy for the devs to work with as possible.

I've heard the role called somewhat derogatorily \"helpdesk for devs\", but that is part of the job, and I embrace it. I also embrace \"yaml wrangler\" - it's not my favorite thing to do, but it does sometimes need wrangling.

Put all status, retrospective, planning and other recurring meetings into this one day so people can actually work the rest of the week. During Covid my company had a 32 hour week for a year and we lost zero productivity because the first thing that was eliminated were the meetings that just fill time but achieve nothing. reply phreack 14 hours agorootparentRegular meetings and calls can't go over twice a week period. For me, it's one of the biggest reasons for unproductivity. I've worked on a lot of projects and the amount of meetings was directly correlated to how much everything was delayed. In all cases, the people who pushed the most for meetings were the ones who contributed the least, and in fact had a negative impact. Nowadays it's a nonnegotiable rule from the start in our agency when taking on new clients. reply Aurornis 15 hours agoparentprevMatches my experience, too. Unfortunately, some companies approach culture and DevEx as an additive system where they keep piling more meetings, more engagement, more activities, and more process on top of everyone’s responsibilities. When a company approaches DevEx and culture by subtracting things that aren’t working it’s like a breath of fresh air. reply maccard 10 hours agoparentprevOne of the things to be aware of is that two meeting free days won't double that output. You still do a lot of valuable \"stuff\" in that meeting time. But, a reliable period of uninterrupted focus time is rocket fuel for an IC.

Yes, I know, I know. The job of a manager is to make good choices and decisions. In the absence of an obvious best choice, they have work backward from both success and failure scenarios, including the political and social impacts. In the absence of external studies and data, if they make an investment in this area and it turns out not to help, they will be left telling their boss things like \"everyone says this is right, not sure why my project didn't work.\" But a flimsy fig leaf that comes from outside and smells objective is a perfect CYA tool that allows the manager to take a risk while anticipating the need to manage and contain failure.

It's quite possibly the only reason non-software companies hire software developers. It's just that IT departments routinely fail to be included in that. So the IT workers get burnt out working on projects they don't understand to make someone else's job easier, while their job gets continually worse because everything is an IT problem now. (And in many cases, nothing actually improves for the business either, because the project only considered the \"happy path\" so they are still spending most their time dealing with the special cases, but now have to go through IT who are too busy doing the same thing for everyone else.) reply gymbeaux 2 hours agoprevA few years ago I worked for a startup that was recently acquired. We were absolutely minting money, but all the devs got these little Dell ultrabooks with dual-core 15W i7 CPUs. It took around 20 minutes to build the frontend of our web app. People generally tolerated it, but I rocked the boat and rallied coworkers until we all got 6-core 45W i7 laptops. I was lobbying for my sanity, but obviously reducing build times by 10x adds up really quickly and the “managing out” from higher ups that I received subsequently was kind of insane considering the man-hour savings. reply bearjaws 14 hours agoprev'Member when DevOps was about improving DX?

Though I think in taking the rest of the context of my criticism away you've avoided the main point of it, which isn't conflict of interest, but whom your research serves to benefit.

Some teams prefer to use a more subjective approach here as well. There aren't any great answers for equivalents in developer experience, yet. There are some obvious \"tooling\" considerations that impact developer experience. For the most part, these are related to how much devs can \"self-service\" the various parts of the SDLC, and how good the user experience of that service flow is.

Nice to see actual data supporting what is already known anecdotally. reply olliej 13 hours agoprevOne big issue in developer productivity that seems less overlooked now is testing and test turnover time. I guess you could argue this falls under the responsiveness banner in the article, but that doesn't really discuss the extensiveness of testing and focuses mostly on things like review feedback. Testing in general is great because as your corpus gets ever larger you can be more confident that just running the testsuite is sufficient to catch regressions. That’s why large projects these days often require every behavioral change or bug fix to have new tests to cover the intended behavior and additional negative tests as well (eg don’t just test the new behaviour/fix works, you have to add tests for neighboring behavior as well). For many simple fixes the time to make tests is actually greater than the time to make the fix itself because you reduce the overall development time for the entire project in doing so. Over time that makes new development substantially easier and less worry inducing, but if you’re constantly adding new tests you get a new problem: eventually running all the tests just takes an absurd amount of time, even spread over all the cores (and depending on what your tests do it can make your computer unusable at the same time). I recall at some point the webkit bugzilla added bots so you could queue automatic test and commit flags, so you could locally test just the subset of tests you expected to be impacted and then rely on the automated infrastructure doing the full tests prior to merging which helped there. I vastly prefer that to \"merge and rely on CI bots catching regressions\" because it trivially leads to you having local checkouts that have failures and then you have to go back and forth verifying the local failures are existing in the tree, etc. In my experience that model seems much more prone to having regularly broken bots, and that breakage leads to normalization of broken bots and general distrust of local failures (\"my change couldn't have caused this breakage, so it must already be broken in the tree and CI hasn't caught up\") You get similar issues with build times and there isn’t really a solution for that in the C/C++ model of compilation - if the wrong header is touched you end up in a miserable near world build misery pit, and it doesn’t seem like there’s any real solution for that yet. This feeds into the last point as well: if you get local failures but you don't have confidence that the build isn't already broken there's much less incentive to rebuild the entire tree without your changes to confirm the \"impossible by your change\" regression is not in fact caused by your changes. reply j45 16 hours agoprevGood DevEx is incredibly important. I'm not so sure it should be obsessed on more than the Customer and User experience, though.

Then again, I lean towards the idea that separating product management and product ownership results in a disconnected product from users. reply james2doyle 15 hours agoprev [–] Incoming semi-related rant. This doesn't apply to LLMs writing code, and it is quite an aside, but I think we have destroyed a lot of ways the web works by chasing a \"good\" dev experience. It is \"nicer\" to write JSX and Typescript in a Next.js project than it was to write jQuery in inline script tags on WordPress. No doubt. But I never had issues maintaining, scaling, updating, or improving those old sites. And I definitely wasn't nickel and dimed for every feature/service I needed to add. I didn't have to wait for builds, or compiling, or worry about the deployment Node.js being a different version than the local Node.js. Or \"open source\" framework features being locked to certain hosts (looking at you RSC and Next.13) and their platforms. And the worst thing, coming back to a project after a couple years and it being impossible to get working because all the tooling has changed and/or been abandoned. I recently had a client from 8 years ago want to move their hosting. They had been sitting on a PHP/Laravel-based CMS, hosted on DigitalOcean, paying $10 a month for ~7 years. I haven't deployed any websites in the last 3 years that I think could even survive that long. Let alone even run locally after that time. The site could be running fine, but the tooling to work on it, or the platforms supporting it, will break. But my dev experience writing them has been, Chefs kiss! React will be updated, and perfectly workable things will be deprecated, the tools to build/bundle code will be deprecated or abandoned for ones with a \"better experience\", and the hosting providers will drop support for older Node.js versions. Maybe this speaks more to the disposable nature of the web these days, but I feel like websites specifically started getting more brittle and complicated when we started chasing dev experience over user experience. reply wk_end 13 hours agoparentI think you're getting some causality twisted - websites started getting more brittle (if they did?) when they started getting more complex, and they started getting more complex precisely because better dev tooling enabled it. reply james2doyle 11 hours agorootparentOh true. That is a good point. I didn't think of it that way reply Kranar 14 hours agoparentprevI think this is mostly your own personal experience and likely a bit rose tinted. It is perfectly possible to deploy a webapp in React that will last for 10 years more or less how a website from 10 years ago could still function today. Also jQuery's very existence was due to how much of a disaster writing webapps was in the past with the host of compatibility issues between not only browsers but just within versions of the same browser. Also there's no issue scaling WordPress? WordPress is notoriously slow and hard to scale. It's a great option for getting a basic website up and running quickly but by God is it a slow and bloated mess and while you can performance tune it, it's not at all a simple or straight forward process and it certainly wasn't easier 10 years ago. I've been a web developer since 1998 and it's definitely much easier to deploy, maintain and scale websites today than it ever was not to mention that websites today play a much larger role with the rise of mobile computing than they did back then. To the extent that it was easier to do anything in the past, it was because the concerns of the past were much smaller than they are today. Security was a much lesser concern 10-15 years ago than now. Writing webapps that work across multiple devices also was a much lower priority. Compatibility was a complete mess, many sites were developed to just work on a specific version of Internet Explorer. The idea that 10 years ago there were minimal problems deploying websites or maintaining them is likely you remembering the good parts and forgetting the bad or that your websites didn't need much scale or didn't address many of the modern concerns that exist today. Things were pretty bad back then to be frank and it's much easier today than it ever was. reply james2doyle 13 hours agorootparentDon't get me wrong, I agree with you that things are easier for developers. I followed a lot of the (let’s face it) hype and marketing around going headless and using hosted services. And the experience is pretty great for a developer. But I've had clients who aren't happy with waiting for builds, paying per seat for a CMS, the turnaround of bug fixes and features, having to buy new services that used to be included, and also keep on top of the 100s of dependencies or changes among those services. All while being constantly charged for these \"pleasures\". reply briffle 13 hours agoparentprev [–] surely they upgraded their OS, and the packages to patch security vulnerabilities, right?

The tax code in the US (and the filing process) is overcomplicated for a variety of political, corporate, and cultural reasons. The average US taxpayer is under-educated on finances generally and tax code specifically. That said, the W-4 is one area that’s actually gotten simpler in recent years. I simultaneously think the tax code needs serious simplification and that the average person has the capacity to read a W-4 and get reasonably close on their withholding.

But if you have any variability in your income, it's hard to predict how much you tax you are going to owe.

In effect, when you are in the $125k to $250k ballpark, you're at a high tax bracket but not making enough to take advantage of the things that allow (for example) Warren Buffet to have an effective tax rate of 11% [1]. So, in the shoes of a typical software engineer, their effective tax rate is ballpark 30~35% and their deductions are pretty minimal. One example my CPA friend gave was landlords getting it good. They can both deduct depreciation and also repair costs - double dipping! Further, any interest on real estate loans they have are also tax deductible. I don't know of more specifics personally, the impression my friend gave me was that those examples are just the beginning.

Further, any interest on real estate loans they have are also tax deductible. Either your CPA friend is ignorant (since after all not all CPAs specialize in income tax) or you misunderstood. Depreciation is how the cost of placing a new asset in service is spread over time to match the income generated by the asset (roughly speaking). Repairs are the cost of keeping existing in-service assets in normal operating condition. There is no double dipping. As for mortgage interest, only interest on the loans used to acquire or improve the property are deductible, not cash-out equity loans. This is basically the same rule that owners of their own principal residence get to use, although there are some temporary limits that can reduce the full deduction, especially for those in areas with expensive houses for sale. reply seadan83 12 hours agorootparent> Either your CPA friend is ignorant (since after all not all CPAs specialize in income tax) or you misunderstood. I might have misunderstood, but he was keeping it simple for me. I'm 100% positive that he was correct though, to what angle - I'm not exactly sure. After doing some more research on my own, I think the double-dipping stands. In essence it comes down to a statement like this: \"my property is worth less year over year - look, the shingles are starting to come off! Oh, by the way, I spent $2000 fixing the shingles.\" So, first, let's tackle depreciation. For rental, the entire property value depreciates and this is tax deductible. It's about 3% of the property value every year [2], regardless of any repairs. If there is an improvement made, that changes the cost basis [2, 4] which then changes the size of the pie where 3% is then taken out of that [2]. In essence, the IRS, per the tax code, essentially thinks that a rental property after 25 years will be worth nothing. To some extent, this makes some sense, appliances wear out, buildings do need maintenance and eventually they are re-modeled and re-done. But, repairs & depreciation are mutually exclusive for the tax code, so long as that repair does not enter the 'improvement' territory. So, if you fix all of things that are depreciating, you still get to claim the depreciation overall, and you get to claim the repair costs of those depreciating items. These are the resources I used: [1] https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employe... [2] https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-r... [3] https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tips-maximizing-repa... [4] https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/top-ten-tax-deductio... [1] is interesting and has this key quote: > You can deduct the costs of certain materials, supplies, repairs, and maintenance that you make to your rental property to keep your property in good operating condition Note, it does not say \"or\" repairs, and that list does not include improvements. Basically this is to say, a $100,000 property after one year of renting, to the IRS is worth $97,000 - whether or not there was actually $3000 worth of wear and tear is immaterial, and if you spent $3000 to fix that wear and tear is also immaterial, you get to claim the depreciation and repairs both. The [4] reference really emphasizes why land lords do not want to replace things, and instead will focus on repairs: > Landlord Tax Deduction #3: Repairs A significant tax break for landlords can arise when they make repairs to their properties: The cost of repairs to rental property (provided the repairs are ordinary, necessary, and reasonable in amount) are fully deductible in the year in which they are incurred. Good examples of deductible repairs include repainting, fixing gutters or floors, fixing leaks, plastering, and replacing broken windows. For some completeness, resource #4 addresses depreciation as the 2nd bullet point right before repairs: > Landlord Tax Deduction #2: Depreciation for Rental Real Property The actual cost of a house, apartment building, or other rental property is not fully deductible in the year in which you pay for it. Instead, landlords get back the cost of real estate through depreciation. This involves deducting a portion of the cost of the property over several years (27.5 years for residential real property). Landlords can reap the benefits of depreciation even if the property increases in value. Thus, my conclusion - if a person is fixing everything that is breaking and wearing out in a rental property - I don't see how exactly that property is depreciating by 3% every year. The depreciating things are getting fixed! I would call that double dipping. Reasonable people might still disagree. Though, to the larger point, resource [4] has a section \"Other Important Tax Tips for Landlords\", reading through that list is a whole slew of things not available to W2 employees, eg: \"A special tax rule permits some landlords to deduct 100% of their rental property losses every year, no matter how much.\" Taken in aggregate, tax-wise, it seems FAR better to be a landlord than a W2 employee. (A peer comment noted that 1099 get really great tax treatment, and that's basically the gist of it. If you can claim you are own your own boss - the tax breaks are huge, otherwise for the run-of-the-mill W2 - there are lot less tax breaks). reply PopAlongKid 11 hours agorootparentI assume by \"double dipping\" you mean, deducting the same expenditure twice. There still is no double dipping. If you buy a $100K asset, and over its depreciable life you also spend $15K on repairs, then you have spent $115K in total and you only deducted $115K, not a penny more -- so no double dipping. Also, FWIW, if you later sell the fully depreciated asset, the entire sale price is taxable income. >A special tax rule permits some landlords to deduct 100% of their rental property losses every year, no matter how much. Yes, if one qualifies as a \"real estate professional\" (not easy for anyone who is not a full-time landlord). However, a successful real estate professional is not going to stay in business long if they have large losses every year. reply creer 9 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be taking this all from the angle of a possible loophole. That's fine and all. But another way to look at it is: Renting is a business. You can say let's tax gross income (and some places do that) but in general in the US only net income is taxed. That is income after costs. For renting there is the cost of the property, there is interest on various loans, there is the cost of maintenance and repairs, there is the cost of upgrades, there is utilities and local taxes, etc. For income there is the rent, and there is the proceeds from the sale of the property at the end, etc. The cost of the property is a cost - that's hard to argue. The question would be how to take it into account. It's currently taken into account with depreciation (of the building, not the land for that matter.) A certain percentage every year goes against the income until it's fully depreciated. And then when the building is sold, the part of the cost that was depreciated is taxed (there is yet another calculation to decide at what rate it's taxed - depreciation reduced basis but \"sale minus basis\" does not necessarily get taxed at capital gains rate.) The hows can get complicated but the general principle of \"how to take into account the business costs\" is pretty simple? And the building cost and maintenance are both costs. Doesn't really matter in there how long the building is supposed to last. It's a fairly arbitrary number in the calculation. [If you do want to look at preferential treatment, you can look at \"like kind exchange\"] reply yieldcrv 14 hours agorootparentprevcorrection: W-2 software engineers that don’t do anything else are pretty screwed 1099 software engineers have some of the best tax deductions, and that earnings range is the sweet spot one of my favorite things to do is contribute $66,000 to a 401k for that tax deduction (thats how high the employer match limit really is), immediately borrow $50,000 from the 401k and donate that same money to a donor advised fund for a charitable donation. $116,000 tax deduction before looking at actual expenses. its not advice, its one of my favorite things to do, you have to pay back the 401k over time off $265,000 in earnings (number chosen because thats the minimum to max out a self directed 401k) the AGI would be $199,000 and the MAGI would be $149,000. keep going and get it as low as possible. I would typically try to do a FMV charitable deduction from my existing portfolio. Combined cash+asset charitable deductions can lower that year’s earnings by 60%. if you achieve that the government is only looking for taxes on $106,000 and again this is before you look for expenses. But if there are pre-existing externalities like a mortgage and home depreciation, then you’re pushing your AGI (and subsequently MAGI) down further and further. you can get to Warren Buffett %’s pretty easily even without having long term capital gains tax treatment. reply PopAlongKid 12 hours agorootparent>you have to pay back the 401k over time And you are also permanently out $50K of charitable contribution in just a single year.

And somewhere in your example you seem to forget that charitable contributions reduce taxable income, but not AGI.

The idea is that if the govt is saying how much you made, how much you owe, and just giving you a place to click \"OK\", it's on the tax payer to do the math to disagree, and the govt has incentive to find you owe more.

These people want everyone to write a check on April 15th every year for the full amount - having to come up with more than $10,000 on short notice is very hard for most people.

No withholding, no quarterly estimated taxes.

And in theory, the IRS already has the majority (if not all) the necessary information needed to file taxes. But Intuit and others lobby to make this more difficult. reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentprevOur taxes are not that complex and for most they have never been than complex. Reagan's tax reforms greatly decreased the complexity, and Trump's reforms made them massively easier for most people. (you can think what you want about both president's but they both made reforms that made taxes much simpler) 3rd parties convince you taxes are complex via underhanded tricks, but that doesn't mean they are. There is a reason tax software puts lots of delays in - they want to you think your computer needs time to do the complex calculations. There is a reason tax preparers interview you and then don't give you the taxes filled out instantly - they want you to think there is a lot of hard work left. Has your tax preparer ever told you that some tax deductible things are not worth deducting or did they just look at and ignore the receipt - that is a way to make taxes seem complex. If you own a small business your taxes might be complex. However most people have been fooled into thinking their taxes are harder than they really are. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentCertain aspects of the tax code for \"normies\" who are on the higher income side has probably gotten more complicated at various times. (Or not, see the increase in the standard deduction.) But I'm willing to bet that if you went back to the 60s or even the 70s, you'd find filling out taxes wasn't appreciably easier and a far smaller fraction of people went to accountants--and of course tax software wasn't even an option. Nor were home calculators. I'm guessing it's far more about the rise of shopping mall tax prep than Intuit lobbying. reply bluGill 13 hours agorootparentMy taxes got much simpler after Trump's reforms - suddenly the standard deduction was large enough that I didn't have to itemize everything (to get the mortgage interest deduction) I'm not old enough to have done taxes before Reagan's reforms, but I'm told things got a lot easier then because a lot less things were deductible and so there was less lines to fill out. reply ghaff 12 hours agorootparentIt was probably pre-Reagan that if you really wanted to optimize you kept track of every sales tax receipt and piddly charitable contribution and probably other things I forget.

Just FYI. reply itake 15 hours agoparentprevAre capital returns taxed? if so, how? reply hervature 15 hours agorootparentI don't know why you are being downvoted. I think it is a very reasonable question to ask how the government can pre-populate capital tax forms without being notified of sales. If the onus is on you to send in the sales documentation throughout the year, then I would not say this is as simple as \"signing on your phone\". If a company handles it for you, then you are paying for that service. I would even to go so far to say that your employer being forced to maintain an accountant to send in your income tax forms is not free to you. The point being made is that anything beyond income tax is essentially impossible to automate since the government cannot (and I believe should not) track your cost side. For instance, the solar tax credit in the US is a scout's honor type form where you can put whatever cost you want to claim that are eligible without receipts. If you get audited, you better hope you can conjure those receipts. How could the government automate such a form? reply danans 14 hours agorootparent> The point being made is that anything beyond income tax is essentially impossible to automate since the government cannot (and I believe should not) track your cost side. Since 2008, brokerage firms are required to include sales and their cost basis information on 1099-B forms.

Create a website where the solar installer registers the installation and enters the cost information of the project, and the taxpayer claims the record and associates it with their tax records. They are already doing something like this for car dealers for the EV tax credits: https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/register-your-dealers... reply hervature 13 hours agorootparentPart of the reason I dislike giving examples is that people think the argument hinges on the examples. The point of my argument is that notifying the government of everything (1099-B in this example) as it happens live and settling at tax time with determined calculations sent to you by the government is the same complexity of maintaining your own records throughout the year then notifying and settling at tax time. The key part I'm emphasizing is that the hard part of taxes is collecting the information and knowing what is taxable. Not the calculation. If you think that taxes are hard because you need to multiply line 17 by 0.3 and then take the minimum of line 19 and 20, then we are not discussing the same thing. Again, pretending that businesses maintaining an army of accountants and filing the relevant information for you as part of their service is \"free\" and \"automatic\" then we do not see things equivalently. A segment of the population believes that the responsibility is on the government to prove you filed incorrectly. Giving them the authority to collect whatever information they want on you is an issue of privacy. Personally, I'm opposed to businesses sending the government all your information not because I want to make life harder for myself/others at tax time but because I don't believe the information will be used only for taxes. The solar example was meant to emphasize the point that the government can only automate the process if every single purchase is marked and accounted for. Giving them the authority to track all purchases (both digital and physical) or mandating others to record said purchases sets a dangerous precedent. Hopefully we could agree on that. reply danans 12 hours agorootparent> Again, pretending that businesses maintaining an army of accountants and filing the relevant information for you as part of their service is \"free\" and \"automatic\" then we do not see things equivalently. I'm not arguing that it's free. Nor am I arguing for sending information about every trade someone makes to the IRS. I'm arguing that since they have to generate a summary 1099-B anyways, why not just transmit it to the IRS electronically? There's no change in privacy, since presumably today you'd follow the law and submit the information from your 1099s to the IRS anyways. reply itake 14 hours agorootparentprevOther examples would include selling items in garage sales. How will the government automatically account for selling of a rare watch or vehicle sales?

The Z80 takes at least one clock cycle to add or subtract an 8-bit number (sometimes several clock cycles, depending on addressing mode). For a 32-bit number those clock cycles add up quickly. In contrast, a modern 3.5GHz CPU can add or subtract several 64-bit numbers every clock cycle And don't get me started on multiplication or floating-point arithmetic. A modern CPU would be thousands times faster, even if it was running at the same clock speed. Thus, I think that the feat is even more impressive than presented! reply flohofwoe 10 hours agoparentIt's even much worse than that ;) The fastest Z80 instructions are 4 clock cycles, at least 7 clock cycles if they also need to load or store an 8-bit value from/to memory, and at least 10 clock cycles for instructions that load or store a 16-bit value. I did a little deep dive into Z80 timings a little while ago using the Z80 netlist simulation from visual6502.org: https://floooh.github.io/2021/12/06/z80-instruction-timing.h... But for BASIC programs those timings don't matter much, since BASIC on 8-bit home computers was easily 100x times slower than assembly code doing the same thing (the difference is probably less though when floating point math is involved, since this also needs to be 'software-emulated' in assembly). reply abecedarius 8 hours agorootparentTo grasp the interpreter speed you need to remember how memory was even more of a constraint than CPU. BASIC had to hold your code in RAM in way that's source-editable and runnable and compact, and process it using interpreter code that's also squeezed for its space. Any obvious optimization you just assume for a speed demon like Python nowadays, you might be surprised about when it comes to those 8-bit Basics. reply crq-yml 6 hours agorootparentprevI've been working with eZ80 on Agon Light and the performance ceiling is considerably different. Both the clocks and the instruction timings are more generous owing to a three-stage pipeline, so while interpretation is still slow, and it's got a clear preference for either 8 or 24-bit(in ADL mode), it is now a Z80 that can be applied productively to high-level code operating over 32-bit values... ...except that the BBC BASIC was giving me Heisenbugs, so I had to give up on it. So I'm on Forth now, and immediately found that Forth is a more productive environment than an early BASIC anyway. Linenums add a killer amount of bookkeeping. reply teaearlgraycold 9 hours agorootparentprevDamn, we’re in CPI territory reply pardoned_turkey 9 hours agoparentprevWell, yes and no. You're correct that ZX Spectrum is a lot slower than the author estimates, but there's also a software-side performance bottleneck: the code is written in the built-in BASIC language, which on ZX Spectrum, was not only interpreted at runtime, but also almost comically unoptimized. For example, people would use \"aftermarket\" circle-drawing routines that performed 10x better than the stock ROM implementation. BASIC on ZX Spectrum was meant for learning, but no serious software of the era relied on it for anything that needed to run fast. I suspect this code could be 10x faster if written in assembly or a compiled language (a handful existed for the platform). reply pjmlp 47 minutes agorootparentAfter learning to code on it, we used BASIC as means to write the utilities to load DATA statements representing Assembly code, hexdump monitors or compiled languages, although the later were relatively hard to take advantage of, given the space requirements. reply YZF 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, there was a C compiler, a Pascal compiler... I'm pretty sure others. I would guess at least 100x for an optimized assembly version. Even 500x between this sort of interpreter and assembly is not unheard of. reply adamredwoods 12 hours agoparentprevhttp://www.andreadrian.de/oldcpu/Z80_number_cruncher.html reply YZF 4 hours agoparentprevZ80A ;) But hey, it booted instantly. Those were the days. reply foobarian 15 hours agoprevThe thing I loved about Spectrum was game loading graphics from tape. Spectrum had a very strange video memory layout, so the bitmap would load first into different thirds of the screen (but still all monochrome). And then at the end the attributes (which were much smaller due to the 8x8 size) would load almost instantly, \"painting\" the monochrome image in a final splash! So this is very nostalgic for sure. And the funny thing is, I like the spectrum renders better than the \"perfect\" ones from a modern computer :-) reply praptak 13 hours agoparentI also remember that there existed cool loaders that were able to paint the image in arbitrary order. It was pretty impressive because it required doing calculations in the tight loop which calculated the delay between slopes of the signal which came from tape. reply ggambetta 13 hours agorootparentI remember a loader where you could play a game of Mastermind while the game was loading. Magic. Blew my mind, it's the kind of thing that wasn't supposed to be possible, yet it was... reply becurious 11 hours agorootparentThere is something like a 171 clock cycle delay in the regular tape loaded routine between looking for edge transitions in the audio signal. You just break your program up into pieces that fits into that. I did one that did a countdown timer and broke it into exactly the loop delay but I suspect the tape loading would be tolerant to a little more inexactness. reply 77pt77 6 hours agorootparentprevThere were games where you could play tic tac toe during loading. Now that's impressive. reply ClassyJacket 10 hours agoparentprevThat's interesting because the design of the Spectrum itself was all black with a splash of colour in the form of a rainbow stripe! It's very similar to Polaroid's colouring. I always thought it looked great. reply stevekemp 5 hours agorootparentIt took me a few years to realize that it isn't a rainbow on the case it's a \"spectrum of light\" (as you'd see from a prism).

The main difficulty with reflections in the ZX Spectrum is not so much the limited color palette, which can be dealt with, but the 2-color limit per 8x8 block. It's already a big issue with just lights and shadows as it is :-/ reply s_gourichon 11 hours agorootparent> the 2-color limit per 8x8 block. It's already a big issue with just lights and shadows as it is :-/ Well, you impressed me (and others) with your simple bet that \"hey, what if I simply choose the two most popular colors\" and just code that in simple BASIC. The same could be done with the shading. It would probably pick a good compromise when bright yellow meets dark red: by choosing to have the few should-be-red pixels become yellow, you avoid a bigger obviously-square-grid-based clash of colors. Next step: error diffusion dithering would IMHO be a good bet. But maybe that becomes really to much for Basic. I've been considering doing Raytracing on the Amstrad CPC, but in C. Perhaps using integers only, for speed. Done that instead: https://cpcitor.itch.io/just-get-9 Hey, found this https://bbcmic.ro/?t=9ctpk via \"BBC BASIC raytracer in 432 characters (mastodon.me.uk)\" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39023056#39023768 reply stevekemp 14 hours agoprevThere _is_ the possibility to define functions, via \"DEF FN\": 10 DEF FN s(x)=x*x: 20 PRINT FN s(3) Of course it is limited, as ZX Spectrum BASIC is limited, but it is an option. reply ggambetta 14 hours agoparentSure.

Credit... Photo illustration by Pablo Delcan Share full article 299 By Malia Wollan Published Jan. 23, 2024 Updated Jan. 24, 2024 Of all the dozens of suspected thieves questioned by the detectives of the Train Burglary Task Force at the Los Angeles Police Department during the months they spent investigating the rise in theft from the city’s freight trains, one man stood out. What made Victor Llamas memorable wasn’t his criminality so much as his giddy enthusiasm for trespassing. He was a self-taught expert of the supply chain, a connoisseur of shipping containers. Even in custody, as the detectives interrogated him numerous times, after multiple arrests, in a windowless police-station room in the spring of 2022, a kind of nostalgia would sweep over the man. “He said that was the best feeling he’d ever had, jumping on the train while it was moving,” Joe Chavez, who supervised the task force’s detectives, told me. “It was euphoric for him.” Listen to This Article Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS. According to detectives, Llamas divulged how he learned to decode the containers stacked on freight trains through his repeated break-ins and by Googling the placards, locking devices, logos and numbers on the containers, which often provided clues to the loot he might find inside. An upgraded lock was a sure sign of more valuable contents. Inside the containers — most of them were secured with metal locks about the size and shape of a corkscrew that easily succumbed to his bolt cutters or mechanized handsaw — the items were varied and plentiful: TVs, beer, clothing, makeup, shoes, electric bicycles, hard drives, tablets. Llamas worked with Connie Arizmendi, his girlfriend at the time. After becoming aware of them, the detectives put a tracking device on the couple’s S.U.V. and followed them around Southern California. The couple would set up in a motel near the tracks somewhere out in the Inland Empire or farther south; they ranged as far as Barstow, more than 100 miles to the east. After nightfall, they would hit the trains and then often shuttle cargo back to their motel rooms for storage. By that point, Chavez, who is 58, had been at the L.A.P.D. for nearly 35 years, working homicides, drugs, gangs, auto thefts and robberies, and he had never heard anyone talk about his crimes as rapturously as Llamas. “He straight out told me, he goes, ‘Detective Chavez, I’m never going to stop doing it,’” Chavez says. Some 20 million containers move through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach every year, including about 35 percent of all the imports into the United States from Asia. Once these steel boxes leave the relative security of a ship at port, they are loaded onto trains and trucks — and then things start disappearing. The Los Angeles basin is the country’s undisputed capital of cargo theft, the region with the most reported incidents of stuff stolen from trains and trucks and those interstitial spaces in the supply chain, like rail yards, warehouses, truck stops and parking lots. Cases of reported cargo theft in the United States have nearly doubled since 2019, according to CargoNet, a theft-focused subsidiary of Verisk, a multinational company that analyzes business risks, primarily for the insurance sector. On CargoNet’s map of cargo-theft hot spots, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and Memphis show up as distinct, high-incident red blobs. But the biggest blob, a red oblong smear, stretches out over the Los Angeles valley like molten lava. Freight trains are massive mechanical constructions, but because they’ve been on the landscape for so long, they tend to be part of the background, like hills. In Los Angeles, however, trains roared back into the public imagination in late November 2021, when a local NBC affiliate ran footage from a section of Union Pacific tracks strewed with thousands of ransacked boxes. The video included a man with bolt cutters climbing up onto moving cars and a reporter’s calls to the packages’ intended recipients, as well as their reactions to seeing their emptied-out boxes. “I’m honestly just disgusted in human behavior,” said a woman in Seattle who was waiting for a car seat for her unborn baby. It was like an IMAX-scale version of those now-ubiquitous security camera videos of porch pirates sneaking off with deliveries. ‘Detective Chavez, I’m never going to stop doing it.’ Soon videos of the trains were circulating all over; by January, the story had become international news and the images a kind of culture-war Rorschach test. When a photojournalist and helicopter cameraman for CBS Los Angeles posted a thread to Twitter featuring similar footage, tens of thousands of people retweeted and commented. Some viewers saw the videos as evidence of the absurdity of global e-commerce run amok; some even reveled at the return of an iconic American crime. One respondent posted a clip of Robert Redford and Paul Newman in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” Another quipped, “Who will cry for the Amazon packages?” But other viewers saw the entire mess as illustrative of a kind of dystopian lawlessness they attributed to liberal cities gone rogue. “This breakdown of order is happening because the bedrock of civilized society, the rule of law, has been abandoned,” the editors of National Review wrote. “For Los Angeles district attorney George Gascón, a paradigm exemplar of today’s progressive prosecutors, this is literally the express-track redistribution of wealth.” At the time, Union Pacific claimed that about 90 containers were being opened per day and that theft on their freight trains in the area was up some 160 percent from the previous year. About 80 guns were stolen from trains. In early 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom donned a pair of work gloves and picked up scattered boxes on the tracks himself. “What the hell is going on?” he asked the assembled television news crews. Image The Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Los Angeles in January 2022, littered with debris left by a rash of package thefts from trains. Credit... Michael Christopher Brown for The New York Times The Los Angeles Police Department scrambled to respond; Chavez and his crew of detectives were put on the case. The boxes on the tracks were cleaned up. And for the most part the story went quiet. But under the placid surface of digital commerce, even as consumers continued to get almost all of their online orders delivered to their doors so seamlessly and quickly it felt vaguely like magic, the supply chain roiled, plagued by thieves, and things continued to go missing — whole trucks’ and train cars’ worth of things. “Give me a call re your land pirates story.” The text that popped up on my phone last fall was from the communications guy at the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents more than 51,000 members. He connected me with Edward A. Hall, who in late 2022 won an upset election to become the union’s national president, after spending 28 years as an engineer for Union Pacific, first in El Paso, Texas, but mostly out of Tucson, Ariz. I wanted to know what it was like to be inside a train during a heist. Up in the cab, Hall told me, he regularly passed stopped trains and saw people clambering up ladders or loading cargo into their trucks pulled up alongside the tracks. Sometimes he saw people breaking into moving trains too. He would call the rail police dispatcher and keep going. Those container doors, meanwhile, stayed open, he said, trailing boxes as the train rolled on. Hall saw all kinds of merchandise spread out across the tracks, including tires and televisions. Engineers don’t stop for this flotsam of global capitalism; they run over it. Once, near the Dragoon Mountains, in southeast Arizona, Hall drove a train through a desolate quarter-mile of track littered with hundreds of pairs of Nike sneakers. “Between L.A. and Tucson is where I know a lot of theft happens,” Hall said. The most extreme type of modern train theft occurs when thieves cut the air-compression brake hoses that run between train cars, thereby triggering an emergency braking system. When that happens, the engineer stays in the cab and the conductor walks the length of the stopped train, trying to locate the source of the problem. (Thieves can also stop a train by decoupling some of its cars.) Of course, if a train is miles long, that walk takes a while. In the meantime, the pilferers unload. Law-enforcement officials told me that it’s not uncommon for thieves to target specific cars full of electronics, say, or tires, in a way that suggests previous knowledge of their contents. Gary Rogers, a former Union Pacific law-enforcement agent, says that during his decades working throughout the West, he saw thieves coordinate their movements precisely; one of them would climb aboard a moving train and know just when and to what extent to cut into the air-compression hose. “The train would stop, and the guys would be there waiting to unload,” Rogers told me. It’s easy to imagine how frightening a heist might be for a train engineer and conductor, but in cases when the train has not been stopped, they often have no idea it’s even happening. Sometimes they won’t know for hundreds, maybe thousands, of miles, until they arrive at their destination and discover looted cars. Piracy is an age-old occupation, particularly prevalent in places and times when large gaps have separated the rich and the poor. But this modern-day resurgence in cargo theft stems in no small part from the extreme ways the internet has altered the buying and selling of things. When the United States Census Bureau began collecting data on e-commerce, in 1998, online sales amounted to some $5 billion. Now that figure is upward of $958 billion; e-commerce revenue is forecast to exceed $2.5 trillion by 2027. The need to get packages to consumers quickly has reshaped the infrastructural landscape, changing the way freight moves around the world, through more warehouses, distribution centers, modes of transport, trucks, trains, planes, delivery drivers. This ever-quickening tangle has opened new vulnerabilities to be exploited by supply-chain thieves. Many in the industry would prefer not to talk about theft. Union Pacific and BNSF Railway declined my interview requests. (They each, along with the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group representing major freight rail, provided written statements emphasizing their commitment to combating theft.) None of the parties involved — the rail companies, the truckers, the shippers, the warehouses, the insurance companies — are required to publicly disclose stolen freight, either. On the website of Operation Boiling Point, which the Department of Homeland Security recently created to go after organized theft groups, the agency states that cargo theft accounts for between $15 billion and $35 billion in annual losses. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a statement emailed to me, estimated that cargo-theft losses amounted to $1 billion nationally in 2021, but the agency acknowledged that that was an undercount. (An F.B.I. spokesperson also confirmed that the agency is working with the rail companies and deploying special agents from its Major Theft Program to address rail and cargo theft in known trouble spots.) One expert on supply-chain risks gave me an estimate of $50 billion in annual losses globally and noted that this kind of crime is a notorious problem in Mexico and Brazil. But essentially it’s impossible to get a clear picture of how much is purloined from the supply chain, who takes it or where it goes next. We do know that often these hijacked goods are cycled back into the online ecosystem, turning up for sale on places like Amazon, eBay, Etsy and Facebook Marketplace (some e-bikes Chavez watched Llamas and others take from the trains later showed up on OfferUp). Sometimes products stolen out of Amazon containers are resold by third-party sellers back on Amazon in a kind of strange ouroboros, in which the snakehead of capitalism hungrily swallows its piracy tail. Last June, California’s attorney general created what was touted as a first-of-its-kind agreement among online retailers that committed them to doing a better job tracking, reporting and preventing stolen items from being resold on their platforms. While declining to comment on specific cases, a spokesperson for Amazon told me that the company is working to improve the process of vetting sellers: The number of “bad actor attempts” to create new selling accounts on Amazon decreased to 800,000 in 2022 from six million in 2020. But filched cargo can be hard to get a handle on; it shape-shifts, in effect. If you’re buying brand-new speakers from someone’s trunk in a parking lot, you can probably deduce that there’s a good chance they were ripped off. But the anonymity of the internet essentially launders stuff. Cindy M. Rosen, executive director of the Americas-focused branch of the Transported Asset Protection Association, told me that the job of tracking misappropriated goods across borders and territories and law-enforcement jurisdictions is often futile, particularly when merchandise is moved out of the country before being sold back into the United States online. Rosen would know: Her organization is made up of insurance companies, federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies, security firms, shippers, truckers, railroad companies and manufacturers. “You’re basically trying to catch a fly in a dark room,” she says. More freight is moved on trucks than on trains, and much more is stolen off trucks, too. Trucking is a chaotic industry, with hundreds of thousands of companies, some as small as a single driver and a truck. Rail, on the other hand, is essentially duopolistic: Just two companies, Union Pacific and BNSF Railway, serve the entire western United States. (CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway dominate the East.) Against trucks, thieves use various forms of digital forgery and cyberfraud, including something called a fictitious pickup, in which someone impersonates an authorized truck driver online and reroutes a truck’s load. This kind of theft increased almost 600 percent between 2021 and 2022, according to CargoNet data. And on the rails, some cargo — coal, grain, cement, fertilizer, petrochemicals, lumber — is just too cumbersome to appeal to thieves. It’s easier to run off with pallets of beer or the newest-issue Nikes. But railroads have increasingly been vying to move more containerized freight. They want to make the most of the e-commerce boom. The fastest-growing segment of rail traffic is what’s called intermodal, which refers to shipping containers and trailers that move on more than one mode of transit: ships, trains and trucks. These containers often carry merchandise bound for stores or packages bound for consumers. Amazon, for example, now has its own branded containers, in part to meet its net-zero carbon emission goal (hauling a ton of goods on rail produces about eight times less emission than on a truck). Such intermodal trains tend to be long, which can make them more vulnerable. Over the past decade, in a push for greater efficiency, and amid record-breaking profits, the country’s largest railroads have been stringing together longer trains. Some now stretch two or even three miles in length. At the same time, these companies cut the number of employees by nearly 30 percent, so fewer people now manage these longer trains. (Currently the Federal Railroad Administration does not place limits on freight-train length, despite safety concerns.) The tracks heading away from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are thick with long trains carrying intermodal containers teeming with imports from Asia — electronics, toys, clothing, shoes, food and beverages — just the sort of offerings thieves find most enticing. “See this?” One of the plainclothes L.A.P.D. Cargo Theft Unit detectives was directing my attention to a box of electronic bird feeders with a yellow sticker on it showing an image of batteries. “Thieves look for placards like this because they know there will be some kind of electronics inside,” he said. We were in a 7,500-square-foot windowless warehouse, surrounded by metal fencing and looped barbed wire, located under Interstate 10 in downtown Los Angeles. The warehouse, packed with $5 million worth of cargo stolen from BNSF Railway, belonged to the California Department of Transportation but had been leased or subleased by thieves the detectives were still trying to identify. They ran across the place almost accidentally a few days earlier, while tracking a truckload of boosted tires. Inside the cavernous room, the towering stacks included pallets of Nike shoes; more pallets piled high with Adidas shoes; Under Armour leggings; Crocs in countless colors and sizes tumbling from boxes onto the dusty floor; air purifiers; computer monitors; thousands of bottles of melatonin gummies; those knee scooters people roll around on after injuries; cordless robotic pool cleaners; tobaccoless cigarettes that smelled like lawn clippings; vape pens; REI outdoor gear; boxes of plastic trash-can liners; Bluetooth speakers; plastic shower curtains; car seats; stainless-steel cookware; and Disney backpacks featuring a heroine I didn’t recognize (an image search later revealed that she was Asha, from an animated film, “Wish,” that had not yet been released). One of the two detectives at the warehouse was previously on the Train Burglary Task Force with Chavez. (Because they work undercover, I’m not using their names.) The detectives studied the labels and purchase-order numbers on the boxes in order to determine the companies of origin and where their goods were being shipped to and from. Then they called asset-recovery specialists at the companies. Nike, Adidas and Under Armour had already sent trucks to recoup their missing goods. The detectives didn’t know yet where the items were stolen, or even if they were taken from an eastbound train or a westbound train or a truck in a rail yard. They suspected that the jumble had been accumulating in this warehouse for months. A BNSF special agent was present, too, creating an inventory of the pillaged property; in most states, the railroad police are certified law-enforcement officers with arrest powers on and off the tracks. He wouldn’t give me his name because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media, but we chatted for a while as two BNSF workers with a forklift loaded the pallets into waiting trucks to be taken to another warehouse. Unprompted, he said that he wanted to retire to an island with no trains, a place where he would never again hear a lonesome train whistle at night. “I hate that,” he told me. Some of the stockpile in the warehouse would most likely be reclaimed. Some would be sold to liquidators. Some would be tossed. The detectives told me that most ingestible things are destroyed — who wants the liability of putting recovered food, beverages or medicines back into the supply chain? One detective’s cellphone rang. “It’s Disney,” he said, tucking the receiver under his chin. It turned out the company had opened its own case into those missing backpacks, which were looted en route to Las Vegas, thereby prematurely letting this heroine out into the world. It is not unusual for stolen cargo to be hidden for a time in just such a warehouse before it can be resold. One night in the spring of 2022, Chavez and his crew of detectives sat in unmarked cars on a road beside the tracks where trains leave the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It was here, on what’s called the Alameda Corridor, where the detectives first spotted the enthusiastic Llamas, loading up a car with oversize boxes containing high-end electric bicycles fresh off the train. That night the detectives followed him to Francisco Guerra, who stashed cargo in a parking lot and in a warehouse packed with burglarized items, including brand-new coffins. The detectives were looking for people working together like this, in organized fencing rings (someone who buys and sells plundered goods is called a fence). But over the course of the task force’s existence, which lasted nearly a year, only 34 of the roughly 700 people arrested or cited for stealing from trains were part of these organized crews. Many more were just passers-by or unhoused people living near the tracks in R.V.s or makeshift structures who just happened to pick up fallen boxes. ‘Look, you’re not El Chapo. This isn’t the crime of the century. This is just some junk in an Amazon trailer.’ Chavez gave me a driving tour of the Alameda Corridor and the city’s other train-theft hot spots in his truck one bright day last October. The tracks were no longer littered with boxes; new fencing and barbed wire had been put up beside them. “Keep your eyes out,” Chavez told me. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see someone stealing stuff off the trains today.” We pulled up alongside a Union Pacific freight train waiting to enter a yard. “They hit that one,” he said. He had stopped his truck in the middle of busy Valley Boulevard to point out a container with its doors hanging wide open. Most of the train cars carried double-stacked containers; many of the top containers had been breached. In some we could see cardboard packages of various sizes. Others looked empty. “See, they hit that one too,” Chavez said. “That’s Walmart. You know they’re going to hit that one.” Earlier that morning, before he picked me up, Chavez took the psychological exam required to become a law-enforcement agent for BNSF Railway. (He retired from the police force early in 2023, just after the Train Burglary Task Force disbanded.) Soon he would be somewhere out along the company’s 32,500 miles of track, which had him thinking about Llamas. In late 2022, Llamas, Arizmendi and their fence, Guerra, were arrested and each charged with multiple felonies related to train heists. Arizmendi and Guerra are serving time in jail; Llamas, however, stopped showing up to his court dates and vanished, after pleading not guilty to eight felony charges and posting bail. “I have a feeling I’ll see him again,” Chavez told me, his eyes scanning the trains as if he might spot the man that very day, scaling the side of a train in motion, bolt cutters in hand. Climbing aboard a moving freight train isn’t as difficult as it might seem. I know; I’ve done it. My hometown in Northern California, like many Western towns, was tiny and sliced through by tracks. In ninth grade, my best friend and I started pulling ourselves up on freight trains as they crawled through town before beginning their ascent into the Sierras. We were bored and had recently discovered the Beat writers and were making a literary zine on my dad’s copy machine; teenage girls scrambling atop the machinery of capitalism was appealingly transgressive. If Jack Kerouac and blues musicians and the teenagers of the Great Depression could hop trains without being crushed, we could, too. I can relate, a little at least, to Llamas’s exuberance. Clinging on with one hand, we sometimes used rusty nails to scratch words on the brightly painted boxes before jumping back down into the sharp gravel and walking back toward home. We never went more than a mile and we never stole anything, although honestly, I wonder now if we might have tried to, had we known how easy it is to open those containers. While truckers are sometimes hijacked at gun- or knifepoint, train theft is almost exclusively nonviolent nowadays. Not so with old-timey train robbers, who were notedly homicidal, with a penchant for explosives. In one study published in the journal Criminal Justice Review, researchers analyzed information culled from newspaper accounts of 241 train heists that occurred between 1866 and 1930. Granted, reporters were most likely covering the more violent robberies, but still, more than 90 percent of them were committed at gunpoint, nearly 30 percent involved dynamite and, in roughly as many cases, at least one person was shot. Sometimes thieves would blow up the track, derailing the train and killing passengers. Newspapers breathlessly covered the thefts, as did Western dime novels and traveling Wild West shows. Notorious train thieves like Butch Cassidy and Jesse James became household names. In 1903, moviegoers flocked to theaters to see a short silent film, “The Great Train Robbery,” featuring four gunslinging bandits commandeering a train and stealing valuables from passengers before escaping on horseback, only to be chased down by a local posse and killed in a shootout. Westerns, with their themes of crime, pursuit and retribution, became part of how we think about criminal justice and the landscapes of the West. It wasn’t uncommon for some train robbers to enjoy a kind of folk hero status too. One thief, William L. Carlisle, who started sticking up trains in Wyoming in 1916, was known as the Robin Hood of the Rails, for his practice of never taking money from women, children or servicemen and for occasionally redistributing a snatched coin before fleeing. When the Library of Congress sent ethnomusicologists to travel the country in the late 1930s to record folk music, they returned to Washington with numerous ballads in both English and Spanish about train bandits. The rail companies didn’t enjoy the same populist affection. They were owned by rail barons who engaged in monopolistic practices and price-fixing schemes while exposing workers and passengers to the sort of danger that’s hard to imagine today. “The railroad was the largest single cause of violent death,” Mark Aldrich, an economic historian, writes in his 2006 book, “Death Rode the Rails,” which details dismemberments, derailments, bridge collapses and run-over pedestrians. In the early 20th century, nearly 12,000 people were killed annually by trains, vastly more than were killed by train thieves. The human geography of the West is so entangled with the railroad as to be indistinguishable from it: Entire cities and towns exist and persist because people organized themselves around the train. When Charles Hodgson, a researcher who is now an economics professor at Yale, studied the effect of railroad construction between 1868 and 1889 on the distribution of towns in the American West, he found that post offices (a stand-in for town health) nearest to train tracks were much likelier to still be extant in 2010 than those a bit farther afield. These latter towns eventually collapsed in what researchers call the “agglomeration shadow,” as people moved and clumped together along the tracks. By the late 19th century, the railroads had a growing army of private police; they didn’t exactly help the railroads bolster their appeal with many local communities. These private police forces were often supplied by the Pinkerton’s National Detective Agency, known for hunting down train burglars and violently breaking up union strikes. In his history of the Pinkertons, the historian S. Paul O’Hara describes the agency as “the apotheosis of industrial violence and corporate power in Gilded Age America.” The legacy of using private security to guard the movement of freight is alive and well in the modern day supply chain too. Insurance, shipping and retail companies hire private investigators, asset-recovery teams and loss-prevention personnel, many of them former police officers. Though the rail companies have their own police forces and interstate law-enforcement authority — Union Pacific police officers, for example, patrol 32,000 miles of track in 23 states — much of the work still falls to local law enforcement. Image The Los Angeles basin is the country’s undisputed capital of cargo theft. Credit... Michael Christopher Brown for The New York Times Last fall, I met Buddy Porch, a detective from the Fontana Police Department, at a monthly meeting of the Western States Cargo Theft Association. He is one of two detectives recently assigned to cargo theft in Fontana, a city of 200,000 or so, some 50 miles east of Los Angeles. “We’re just being hammered, completely overwhelmed,” he told me. The city has been transformed by speedily constructed, prefabricated tilt-up mega-warehouses. Loads from semi-trucks are being taken, train cars emptied out. The entire region has been altered by digital commerce; the inland empire now has in excess of 1.4 billion square feet of warehouse space, with plans for millions more. It’s a place run through by train tracks and traversed by nearly a million trucks daily, spewing carbon dioxide and pollutants and tempting all manner of thievery. It’s a lot for Buddy Porch. The technology exists to make containers less susceptible to theft. Companies sell container-locking devices with GPS and cellular connectivity that permit the containers to be tracked at all times. Sensors stuck on the freight itself can report locations and precise conditions inside containers, including temperature, humidity and the bumpiness of the ride. Containers can be outfitted with smart seals, motion-detection alarms, video surveillance and infrared imaging systems that can detect intruders’ body heat. And yet, the locks so often used to secure containers with hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise inside are easier to cut off than the lock I use to secure my old beater bicycle. I kept asking people, Why? The answers were varied, but as far as I can tell, the reason is that in the last several decades, the cost of shipping has fallen so much that cheap shipping has become part of the essential energy force pushing the tsunami of low-cost goods across the seas and onto our shores. A company with 20,000 containers might decide it isn’t worth an extra $10 per container for better locks or seals. In part because even if they did opt for the upgraded security, who or what would respond when the alarm goes off or when the smart seal sends notice that it’s been breached? What if the signal pings from a train in the middle of some empty stretch in West Texas? “Anything that adds to that transportation cost, including security, is typically thought of as extraneous or unnecessary,” Tony Pelli, director of security and resilience at the multinational business consultancy BSI Group, told me. After all, most cargo is insured anyway. But the insurance companies, for their part, would very much like to reduce the plundering. Travelers, one of the largest cargo insurers in the country, employs 12 full-time cargo theft investigators who travel the land, sometimes lending a “sting trailer” wired with surveillance equipment to law enforcement, to claw back some of those stolen goods. They’re also trying to educate warehousing, shipping, trucking and rail companies on how to deter thieves in the first place. Talk to anyone whose business is protecting or insuring freight, and they will tell you some iteration of “cargo at rest is cargo at risk.” They advise truckers, for example, to avoid stopping at all within the first 200 miles from their pickup point, in case they’re being followed. An opened box of Maker’s Mark whiskey bottles sat by a cubicle on the fifth floor of L.A.P.D.’s imposing downtown headquarters, evidence from a recently recovered stolen truckload. A cargo-theft detective’s cellphone rang; on the other end was an officer from a division to the south who had received a 911 call reporting that two men were rifling through an Amazon truck trailer. Fifteen minutes later, when the two detectives pulled up in their two separate cars to the blue container, with its telltale swooping logo, they could see that the truck’s cab was gone. The container’s back doors were ajar, and boxes had spilled out onto the sidewalk. Following a detective, I eagerly climbed up into the container, wondering if my anticipatory excitement was akin to what thieves feel when they steal a container but don’t yet know what their treasure hunt will yield. What I found inside were boxes and boxes of Arm & Hammer Forever Fresh cat litter. “It looks like a load of Amazon crap,” said the shorter detective still standing on the street, hands on hips, peering inside. A bit deeper in, I could see plastic anti-scratch cat protector couch covers, Cheerios, Christmas advent puzzles, more cat litter. Someone had been there before us and had helped themselves to the Funables Super Mario fruit-flavored snacks: The colorful candies and ravaged packaging were scattered across the floor. The detectives figured someone had probably stolen the truck, popped open the container, found it rich in cat litter and ditched it. The taller detective called someone in asset recovery at Amazon, who confirmed that the container should have arrived in another city two days earlier. The detective asked the Amazon rep if the company was planning to come claim the container. The two of them went back and forth for a while, until eventually the detective told the rep that he had 90 minutes to get someone there or the police would impound the container. “It doesn’t make sense for us to spend half the day babysitting this thing,” the detective said, exasperated, when he got off the phone. After a tow truck took the container away, the detectives returned to the neighborhood police station. Earlier that morning, L.A.P.D. officers patrolling the area near the abandoned container spotted a black S.U.V., with two men inside, that matched the description given by the 911 caller. They pulled the vehicle over and, seeing what looked like Amazon packages inside, took the men into custody. Now the taller detective interviewed them with the help of another Spanish-speaking officer. At first, the men in custody didn’t want to talk. Then the detective brought in snacks and water. The detective told me: “I said: ‘Look, you’re not El Chapo. This isn’t the crime of the century. This is just some junk in an Amazon trailer.”’ One of the men started talking. He told the detective that he was mostly living on the streets; the S.U.V. belonged to his brother; the container was already open when they found it; a person he didn’t know offered him $20 to help unload; he and his friend took the money, and when they were done, they grabbed some spoils for themselves too, which they had stashed in his brother’s tent down by the railroad tracks. The detectives put the man who talked, the one with the brother, in a police vehicle and had him direct a patrol officer to his brother’s tent. The two detectives followed behind, till they pulled up to a row of structures built from plywood and tarps along a section of seemingly abandoned tracks near the intersection of East Olympic Boulevard and Lemon Street. “All we want is the stuff,” the taller detective told the man identified as the brother. “We don’t care about anyone else. Or anything that’s going on.” The man by the tent looked at his brother in the back of the patrol car with one of the weariest expressions I have ever seen. And then he started lugging packages from his tent. A box containing a pet-grooming vacuum cleaner. Two new radio-controlled model airplanes. Doc Martens boots. Boxes overflowing with flip-flops. Printer cartridges. A cerulean blue spaghetti-strap dress in a plastic sleeve. The brother disappeared back behind the tarp door, and the shorter detective called to him, “Bring me the boxes, I know there’s more shit in there.” Once the detectives were satisfied that they had what they’d come for, they loaded it all into their unmarked cars and drove away. The man in the back of the patrol car was eventually driven to a police station, where he would spend the night in custody. Later, the detectives would look up all the recovered loot on Amazon and tally up its total value, which exceeded the $950 minimum required for a charge of felony grand theft in California. (The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declined to file a felony charge and referred the case to the city attorney’s office, which filed a misdemeanor instead.) I left the encampment discombobulated by the mismatch between the perpetrators (down-and-out men living in tents stealing goods someone else had already nabbed and discarded), and the victim (a multinational company valued at more than $1.5 trillion). The stuff had been taken unlawfully, yes, but part of the reason these companies manufacture items for so much less in Asia and then transport them thousands of miles in ships and trains and trucks is so they don’t have to pay the costs associated with adhering to environmental and labor laws here. Also, I was flummoxed trying to imagine how a man living in a tent would go about selling a stolen pet-grooming vacuum cleaner. What even is a pet-grooming vacuum cleaner? On my last day in Los Angeles, I drove south in my rented Chevy Spark to take in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which appeared on the horizon at sunrise as a single mega port enveloped in a particulate-laden, golden-colored haze. It was strangely beautiful. And a little scary. The closer I got, the more semi-trucks were rumbling past me in both directions. Numerous trains, side by side, waited to be loaded on half a dozen parallel tracks. Lines of trucks snaked around in no discernible pattern. Stacks of chassis towered in fenced-off yards. Everywhere containers were in motion; massive gantry cranes reached out over ships to grab at steel boxes like hungry horses. One human in a puny rental car can’t take in the scale of the global supply chain, but even this sliver of something so vast was enough to inspire awe. The four L.A.P.D.’s Cargo Theft Unit detectives had been scheduled that day to go undercover at a mall and wander around stores pretending to be shoppers. Southern California had had a recent uptick of what were being called flash-mob robberies. The Versace store in the Beverly Center was hit, as was the Nordstrom in a mall in Canoga Park and an Yves Saint Laurent in Glendale. Videos from Southern California and elsewhere were going viral that showed people in black ski masks swarming stores, grabbing merchandise, jamming it into large garbage bags and fleeing. The Police Department, along with other regional law enforcement agencies, now had a new Organized Retail Crimes Task Force. The detectives were setting up in anticipation of the next flash-mob robbery. I’d asked Alfonso Lopez, former commanding officer of the commercial crimes division at the L.A.P.D., who until recently oversaw the Cargo Theft Unit detectives (he is now assistant commander for the Operations South Bureau), how he thought the overall losses from these flash mobs compared with the scale of theft from trains and trucks. He said cargo theft was bigger. But that didn’t matter, the viral flash-mob videos had snagged in the city’s psyche, in the country’s psyche. I pulled over into a dusty lot to listen to the low roar of the port and watch the trucks and trains. Just one of these steel boxes contained more merchandise than a dozen flash mobbers could ever hold. But the supply chain is hard to grasp fully with its anonymous-looking containers rolling by, giving away so little about their contents or destinations. Our collective gaze was shifting toward the human drama we can see, focusing instead on videos of these young people dressed like ninjas running full tilt for the exit, stolen goods spilling from their arms.

More common than you think (nytimes.com)197 points by tysone 15 hours agohidepastfavorite288 comments 0cf8612b2e1e 14 hours agoThe most extreme type of modern train theft occurs when thieves cut the air-compression brake hoses that run between train cars, thereby triggering an emergency braking system. When that happens, the engineer stays in the cab and the conductor walks the length of the stopped train, trying to locate the source of the problem. (Thieves can also stop a train by decoupling some of its cars.) Of course, if a train is miles long, that walk takes a while. In the meantime, the pilferers unload. Way more brazen than I had imagined. I was foolishly just thinking these were people sneaking into train yards at night. reply atourgates 13 hours agoparentMost of it is much more opportunistic than that example. > \"But over the course of the task force’s existence, which lasted nearly a year, only 34 of the roughly 700 people arrested or cited for stealing from trains were part of these organized crews.

Most were essentially opportunistic thefts by individuals on the margins of society. reply spenczar5 13 hours agorootparentCareful, there: 5% of the people arrested or cited. That is not the same as 5% of the thefts (one would expect the professionals do more than their share of the thieving) or even 5% of the thieves (one might believe that pros are less likely to get caught). reply ysavir 11 hours agorootparentIt's also not representative of the quantity of stolen cargo. Even if it's 5% of thefts, that 5% could be responsible for 60% of stolen cargo. reply dotancohen 1 hour agorootparentThis is such a great example of lying with statistics. I know that it was not deliberate, which is why the lie is so effective. Even the teller believes it to be true. reply HenryBemis 1 hour agorootparent> I know that it was not deliberate Although I never underestimate human stupidity or laziness for misrepresentation of numbers/statistics/etc, it's usually some poor SME that writes the report, and then the Manager sees the \"60%\", freaks out, asks the SME to rewrite making it softer, and thus the truth is (given a serious effort to be hidden). I've been writing audit, security, and other reports a big part of my life. I tend to write numbers in the form of \"5 out of 100 X (5%) examined, regarding the Y process, failed due to..\". It freaks out anyone who reads my reports, but, hey, they pay me for accuracy and truth. Once I send it (and it's 'untouched' on my Sent Items), they can do whatever they want with it, as long as they put THEIR names & signatures in the bottom if they change a single word (sorry for the cynicism but there exists no corporate hill that I want to die on) - also you never know when a regulator will come back 6.5 years later and ask about THAT job scheduler that was transferring £€$5bn per day between X-system and Y-system. I cannot recount the AMOUNT of times my report has 'softer' writing in the end, and it's their prerogative. But \"it's not deliberate\"????? No way in hell!!! Manager --> Director --> C-suite --> Audit Committee --> Regulator.

It would certainly be a good way to catch one type of thief while entirely missing the biggest heists. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 10 hours agorootparentIf you pick up a box off the road, are you a thief? reply jdietrich 7 hours agorootparentIf that box is sealed, it has someone else's address on it and you make no effort to return it to them, then you are inarguably a thief. It's no different to taking a parcel from someone's porch. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft_by_finding reply sandworm101 10 hours agorootparentprevYes. The fact that property is unguarded doesn't render it free to any random person. You can legitimately safeguard something, such as moving it off the road, but once you open the box or take the box home, you are a thief. And if the box is sitting on railroad property, you are likely guilty of attempted theft as soon as you pick it up. Also trespassing. reply pi-e-sigma 10 hours agorootparentWhat you say is not true in the slightest. In a lot of the US jurisdictions you can keep what you found provided you report it to the authorities and nobody claims it in some time frame. In other cases you can take what you found if you found it on your land etc. Lots of various laws apply, depending where you live and what exactly you found. If it was likely to be intentionally left where you found it to be later picked up again, or if it was intentionally abandoned etc. You can even take legal ownership of land that you and the authorities know is not yours provided you use it long enough (adverse possession) and you think a random box left by the side of the road is somehow untouchable? reply solatic 3 hours agorootparent> nobody claims it in some time frame You have some nerve to equivocate between an anonymous object bearing no clues as to its ownership and a box with an address label on it signifying exactly to whom the parcel belongs. How do you blame an owner who likely lives hundreds if not thousands of miles away for not contacting every police precinct along the shipping path instead of expecting someone who finds the parcel to simply return it to the shipping company so that they can finish the job? reply Mordisquitos 1 hour agorootparentA more generous quote of GP comment provides the answer: > provided you report it to the authorities and nobody claims it in some time frame One would expect that \"report it to the authorities\" covers that problem. The authorities will take care of either contacting the shipping company and letting them know, instructing you on how to do it yourself, or even take possession of the package to return it themselves. reply neilkk 1 hour agorootparentprevThe package in transit belongs to Amazon not to the addressee. reply sandworm101 9 hours agorootparentprevNot for amazon boxes that fall off trucks. reply londons_explore 7 hours agorootparentAmazon isn't gonna go to the police station to claim their lost box... So actually, this would probably work to legally claim an amazon box. reply NoZebra120vClip 4 hours agorootparentHow would that work? If you find an object with no obvious owner, you either leave it where it lies, or you report it by turning it in somewhere. To the business where you found it, or the Lost & Found department of the transit authority, or the police if all else fails. I don't see anyone calling up the police to say, \"Hi, I foundand I'll keep it until someone comes over here to claim it!\" because the only people coming over will be the police themselves. Every place with a Lost & Found service, and the police, regularly liquidate the unclaimed property. You can find lists and auctions on your civic website if they're selling the stuff. They may also donate it to charity or destroy it. The police or anyone else are not going to stick a tag on a box with your name and number so you can come to claim it after the grace period elapses. That's not how claiming stuff works. reply londons_explore 10 hours agorootparentprevIn my moral view, yes you are if you do not make at least a minimal effort to locate the properties true owner. For example, calling the phone number written on the outside of the box. reply Terr_ 4 hours agorootparentIn the legal view too. (At least in the US.) reply pixl97 10 hours agorootparentprevThe difference in the road and a train track is one of public and private property. The train track is not public property and even walking down it can lead to an arrest for trespassing, much less picking up boxes and carrying them off. reply Terr_ 4 hours agorootparentThat particular distinction doesn't really matter: If I drop my wallet in the street and someone finds it and takes all my cash, that's theft regardless of whether it landed on the public road or a short distance away on a private driveway. (Also, I don't think anyone would consider it \"finders keepers\" if the thief started using the credit-cards!) So it's theft either way, but the private-ness of the zone may mean additional crimes are getting committed, such as trespassing and/or burglary. (Or worse variations of the same crime, depending on how the laws are written.) reply ttt11199907 4 hours agorootparentWould it still be theft if the money in your wallet was money that you found on the street the day before? reply Terr_ 2 hours agorootparentHuh? Thieving from a thief is still theft, the same way that raping a rapist is still rape. (Also even when a wily Sicilian complains that \"You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen\".) reply legitster 13 hours agoparentprevThe videos of people just standing on moving trains in broad daylight ripping open packages is... something else. Completely changed the way I understand society. reply xattt 11 hours agorootparentSomething happened between the Wild West when this was common and now which brought a stop to that behaviour for a century and a half. That something needs to happen again. reply elzbardico 10 hours agorootparentYeah. That something that happened during that period of time was: - Stable jobs with good salaries - Home Ownership - Salaries that increased as much as profits when productivity raised.

We sit there and put folks in jail or prison for an offense, where we might hold them in solitary for months - and if they aren't, they are in a system where people *assume' they are going to get raped by another inmate (it is a common joke, after all). And then we let them out, put them on probation with a bunch of fees that need paid, a record that makes it difficult to find legal work - especially the sort that will pay bills plus probation - and might exclude them from public housing. And when I say exclude, I mean they might not be able to stay with family for a week if their family lives in public housing. Harsh penalties do not protect the public. Harsh penalties are the result of a system meant to extract misery, sometimes for fairly minor expenses. If we (Americans) cared about protecting the public, we'd house people, feed them, make it so crimes of desperation are fewer.

Those people would be unlikely to steal Amazon packages even if the sentence was a fine and 30 days of social work because they are usually in a different place in society anyway. (Don't get hung up on exceptions) Those that decide to steal anyway are often those that think they won't get caught. It doesn't matter if they don't sit in prison for 2 years or for 25.

This feels like a lot for shoplifting. At the same time, as a law abiding citizen this coming down hard on crime sure makes my life easier. My TJ Maxx doesn’t have boards on the windows and they don’t have off duty cops posted at the door, unlike the Target I visited on my trip last year to the SF Bay Area.

The biggest problem is of course, societal. One anecdote from an anti-theft taskforce in the article showed that less than 5% of the thefts were prepretrated by organized groups, and the other 95% were from \"passers-by or unhoused people living near the tracks in R.V.s or makeshift structures\". People on the margins of society, who see an opportunity to make some money. Ideally, we'd fix the problem of unhoused people on the margins of society and we'd eliminate the vast majority of thefts like this. But of course, that's a much harder problem to solve. Much easier, then, to respond with bigger locks, and more security cameras, and GPS trackers and more security guards in vulnerable hotspots. While those measures might work (to an extent) to solve the immediate problem, they don't work to make the society that I'd like to live in. I'd much rather live in a more equitable society that works to eliminate homelessness, and the conditions that lead to this type of theft, then one that just prevents it with punatitive measures and thorough enforcement. reply Reubend 11 hours agoparent> Ideally, we'd fix the problem of unhoused people on the margins of society and we'd eliminate the vast majority of thefts like this. I don't see any evidence of this. The article did point out that only 5% of the arrests were organized criminals, but I would expect the organized ones to do more than their fair share of total thefts. I'd also expect them to get arrested less often than their amateur counterparts. But more importantly, your proposal assumes that eliminating poverty would eliminate crime. That makes intuitive sense, but I don't think it's true.

Prison in the US is pretty awful, so I wouldn't expect \"harsh treatment\" to be a reason that crime is low. Additionally, Japanese recidivism isn't particularly low (50%).

It's not about being \"awful\" (inflicting maximum misery) but about effectively correcting problem behaviours. This actually requires a high degree of discipline and order among prison staff, not unlike raising children. Life in Japanese prison is highly regimented, expectations of correct behaviour are high, and inmates are not allowed to freely interact and form a prison culture. This is in contrast to the US, where prison is effectively crime university. There are also effective post-correctional structures, eg. hiring discrimination against convicts isn't legal.

The actual issue here is train companies have cut staff down to almost nothing while simultaneously increasing train length to miles and miles. (And they are trying to cut staff even further). A train with 2 miles worth of cargo and 2 people to defend it ends up being SUPER easy for a thief to target and rob. It takes an hour just for someone to figure out what's happening to the train. What's the solution? How about the train companies employ more people, install more cameras, or shorten their trains? Or they can use their insurance to cover the cost of lost goods (as they are almost certainly already doing). Train companies are trying to operate like the dollar general and are putting on surprised pikachu faces when they get robbed like a dollar general store. Almost certainly what they want to happen is the offloading of their security problems onto the public.

So it's hard to understand what security investments are supposed to achieve. reply joe_the_user 13 hours agorootparentNah, another piece of this is that rail companies have eliminated rail yards and park those super-long trains on just random tracks (at least in the LA area). They then complain about the homeless who camp on the sides of the tracks and demand that LA county do something about the camps. The homeless may provide cover for the professional thieves but the homeless aren't the thieves (and the county should indeed eliminate the homeless camps by finding them housing but given a population of people can't legally or pleasantly sleep anywhere, that population is going gravitate to area least protected and that's railroad tracks and freeways, where problem things happen - notice recent freeway fire, etc). Rail companies go in, apprehend the homeless for trespassing and then complain that county won't prosecute them. And no, the county sensibly doesn't want to fill it's jails with vagrants just 'cause the rail companies don't park their trains where they're safe. All this is part of the \"supply chain problems\" of the last few years but the thing with those is the large carriers (shippers and railroads) actually made profits by a legal situation wound-up as \"our losses are your losses, our gains are ours\".

Trains run through very long multi jurisdictional route often with no meaningful police along the routes and no access due to lack of roads along the route. This was especially true historically but still remains true today. Train robberies have been a real thing for a long time with the robbers not being stupid and attacking the train far from police presence. Further rail facilities require 24x7 protection that local police can’t afford to offer. 2. They often have specific laws at a federal level and as I understand it wouldn’t depend on general local courts and prosecutors, particularly on interstate lines. For spur lines it’ll usually be state prosecutors. The crux of it is the rail companies probably don’t WANT to hire police if they absolutely can avoid it. That’s very expensive and I’m sure they would rather just eat losses, pay insurance premiums, and whine to local and state police for more coverage at the tax payers expense. reply Scoundreller 12 hours agorootparentSure they want their own police.

The importance of the railroads is why there is so much checkerboarded land in the western US, it was given away in grants to the railroads. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboarding_(land) The railroads using shorter trains would allow them to keep the trains in the railyards, where they have more physical control.

Also, the aggregate shoplifting for an individual is “allowed” until the dollar amount crosses the line for it to be considered a felony. At that point, the fat stack of evidence is handed to local DA/PD. The same tech used for tracking your browsing and purchase behaviors also works pretty well for identifying and tracking known shoplifters. I’d wager that going after every instance of misdemeanor theft would be an ineffective use of resources at their scale. With that said, it makes less than zero sense for Target to ask retail employees to risk their lives in order to stop someone stealing a cart full of Tide or pockets full of sonicare replacement heads.

Reading them you realise that Euler really did invent a huge swathe of mathematics in use today. In particular I read this one: http://eulerarchive.maa.org/hedi/HEDI-2009-02.pdf And I realised that Euler had found two formulae for Pi which can be used to calculate any hex digit of Pi. I wrote this up in a paper: \"In 1779 Euler discovered two formulas for π which can be used to calculate any binary digit of π without calculating the previous digits. Up until now it was believed that the first formula with the correct properties (known as a BBP-type formula) for this calculation was published by Bailey, Borwein and Plouffe in 1997.\" https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/euleriana/vol3/iss1/3/ reply jacobolus 14 hours agoparent> In particular I read this one: http://eulerarchive.maa.org/hedi/HEDI-2009-02.pdf [...] wrote this up in a paper https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/euleriana/vol3/iss1/3/ Neat! It's not clear that Euler ever realized anything about calculating an arbitrary binary digit, but it wouldn't have been too far a leap to get there. For what it's worth, the formula (13) your paper credits to Hutton was also known to Machin in 1706. As was the formula about which Sandifer says \"Without citing any particular formula, Euler proclaims that ...\". The famous \"Machin formula\" just happened to be the one that Jones published along with an accurate π approximation in Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos, but Machin had worked out several others. See Tweddle, Ian (1991). \"John Machin and Robert Simson on Inverse-tangent Series for π\". Archive for History of Exact Sciences. 42 (1): 1–14. doi:10.1007/BF00384331. JSTOR 41133896. The transformation of the series for arctan to a faster-converging version which Sandifer discusses in the middle of that paper was first described by Newton in an unpublished monograph from 1684. See: Roy, Ranjan (2021) [1st ed. 2011]. Series and Products in the Development of Mathematics. Vol. 1 (2 ed.). Cambridge University Press. pp. 215–216, 219–220. Newton, Isaac (1971). Whiteside, Derek Thomas (ed.). The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton. Vol. 4, 1674–1684. Cambridge University Press. pp. 526–653. reply Paul-Craft 13 hours agoparentprevI just skimmed through the MAA article and I'm reading your paper right now. I think it's supremely cool that people are still getting mileage out of papers published almost 250 years ago. One other cool thing about Euler and BBP-type pi series: Euler seems to have derived his results in a manner similar to how the famous BBP formula {\\displaystyle \\pi =\\sum _{k=0}^{\\infty }\\left[{\\frac {1}{16^{k}}}\\left({\\frac {4}{8k+1}}-{\\frac {2}{8k+4}}-{\\frac {1}{8k+5}}-{\\frac {1}{8k+6}}\\right)\\right]} is actually proven. A friend of mine gave the proof of the famous series result as an exercise in his honors calc 2 class one year. They had some fun with it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%9... reply seanhunter 17 hours agoparentprevPart of the problem is he wrote so much it has taken a while to go through it all. I believe the \"Opera Omnia\" project to publish all his works has been going for over a hundred years and is just about getting to the end now. So I would expect there's a huge amount that just hasn't been fully appreciated/digested. reply jacquesm 14 hours agorootparentA while indeed. Euler and Bach are similar in that sense: to properly ingest their life's output you need more than one life. reply m_mueller 14 hours agorootparentprevHow is this humanly possible? Was Euler even an order of magnitude faster at producing new math than, say, Gauss or von Neumann? reply chongli 12 hours agorootparentEuler had scribes do a lot of the grunt work for him. His vision was quite bad and worsened throughout his life, going blind in his right eye rather early on and later developing cataracts in his left.

Even the work of someone like Erdos seems very esoteric by comparison and also was largely done in collaboration. Was Euler just born at the right time and picking all the low hanging fruit? Or maybe his immense creative production was a unique consequence of wealth plus limited distractions? I'm inclined to believe there are similarly talented individuals today but wonder if it is even possible to fully recognize them in the moment. Perhaps we will only discover the Eulers (and Shakespeares and Bachs) of today in a few hundred years time. reply feoren 16 hours agoparentPart of it is low-hanging fruit, certainly. Euler lived at a time when it was still possible to \"know all math\". That breadth of knowledge is simply not possible for a single human anymore; the discipline of mathematics is orders of magnitude larger. Comparable mathematicians today like Erdős and Terence Tao collaborate because they really can't learn the intricate details of every corner of math, so they collaborate with people who work in those corners instead. I think these are all people that have a deep understanding of the interconnected structures within math, and that makes them incredibly productive. I'm not going to try to compare the \"level of genius\" between Euler, Erdős, and Tao (although I think the latter two would readily claim Euler wins), but once you have a gift like that, there's a big difference between having all of mathematics in your head and not. reply zyklu5 14 hours agorootparentI find the notion of 'low-hanging fruit' in such contexts profoundly ahistorical. If graph theory was low-hanging why did it take thousands of years since Sumer or ancient Egypt? Or consider something from number theory: every other batch of students in a math camp I'm familiar with has someone who has 'proved' quadratic reciprocity for themselves -- and how could they not ? -- since childhood they have been immersed in a culture which points at it; while it took Euler roughly 40 years to even formulate the idea and then Gauss to prove it. It's not that - to use an anachronistic term - class field theoretic phenomena was not known to other cultures thousands of years ago. (Btw there are many contemporary mathematicians at least at the level of Terence Tao but for some reason haven't been blessed by lay popularity -- mostly because Tao's math looks more school math like / familiar to non-math people than say Peter Scholze's) reply feoren 14 hours agorootparent> If graph theory was low-hanging why did it take thousands of years since Sumer or ancient Egypt? Because it wasn't low hanging thousands of years ago. It was only low hanging after an enormous body of foundational work was laid down over those thousands of years. And Euler knew all of it. It's no longer possible to know all of mathematics. > every other batch of students in a math camp I'm familiar with has someone who has 'proved' quadratic reciprocity for themselves This is exactly my point though: things get easier to understand over time as the more foundational mathematics gets laid out to prepare for them. Nowadays some of this stuff is considered basic. It's very \"low hanging fruit\" now, it's just that those summer-camp kids aren't making the discovery for the very first time. What point exactly are you defending here? > Btw there are many contemporary mathematicians at least at the level of Terence Tao but for some reason haven't been blessed by lay popularity I'm not sure why this needs to devolve into a contest. Terence Tao, Peter Scholze, whoever: they can't know all math anymore, like Euler did. That is ultimately why there are no more Eulers. reply chongli 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's low-hanging fruit because it depended on a bunch of mathematics and technology that Euler benefitted from: algebra, the printing press, and mass-produced paper. Sure, the Ancient Egyptians had papyrus but that is nothing compared to the volume of paper Euler had available to him. Euler lived nearly three centuries after the invention of the printing press. He had vast numbers of books available to him and essentially unlimited paper to write on. He also had been tutored in algebra which remains the most important development in the history of mathematics. The abstract manipulation of symbols made possible by algebra is such an enormous leap over the geometric methods of the ancient mathematicians. It allows one to solve countless problems trivially in seconds which would take days to solve geometrically. reply norir 15 hours agorootparentprevTo be clear, I am not saying that Erdos and Tao are less talented than Euler. That seems impossible to say. But the magic of Euler is that his fingerprints are all over so many of the fundamental things that can be understood by a bright high school student but were mostly unknown before him. The work of figures like Erdos and Tao seems far, far less accessible in its present form at least and thus more limited in its overall impact. reply feoren 14 hours agorootparentPart of that, too, is the \"founding father\" effect. Most humans alive today are related to Genghis Khan and/or Charlemagne. It just takes time for new ideas to dissipate and cross-breed. reply lp4vn 15 hours agorootparentprevThe low hanging fruit argument only takes you so far. How many other mathematicians in his epoch or before were able to pick as many low hanging fruits as him? reply feoren 14 hours agorootparentBy all means he was a crazy outlier generational genius. A few others in history, like Archimedes and Newton, have been accused of \"not leaving anything for anyone else to discover\" as well. The question was: why do we not seem to see these crazy outliers anymore? The answer is certainly not that truly exceptional people simply stopped being born after the year 1800. The nature of what it could mean to \"know everything\" about a field has completely changed. reply lupire 12 hours agorootparentAlso they lived in a time with far less education and communication. Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus simultaneously. If calculus were a hot new idea now, dozens or hundreds of people would be discovering it simultaneously. Look at NN/LLM AI for an example. reply chongli 15 hours agoparentprevVon Neumann is the closest comparison I can think of. A child prodigy who made a very large number of contributions to mathematics, computer science, physics, and engineering. reply FredPret 17 hours agoparentprevIt takes time for true quality to become apparent. Unfortunately the human who produced the work is long dead by then. If humans ever started living much longer, we'd probably see a different attitude towards work. reply testless 16 hours agoparentprevRamanujan died early. He is another one which comes to mind. reply vacuity 15 hours agorootparentRiemann died young, too. I only really know him for the Riemann sum formulation of integrals (I have yet to learn complex analysis), but I wouldn't be surprised if he has some popular reach through the Riemann hypothesis. reply jasomill 9 hours agorootparentAnother example: the notion of an n-dimensional geometric structure with intrinsic, variable curvature that serves as a mathematical foundation for the theory of general relativity originated with Riemann[1].

Einstein is way more well known than Euler, I'd guess. Even if you will ask most famous mathematician, it is unlikely that he is named. Probably Pythagoras. I have no data to back it up. reply lordnacho 14 hours agorootparentThis is purely an indictment of modern mathematics education. Anyone doing ordinary high school math should have had their ears full of Euler's contributions for at least a couple of years towards the end. Math teachers who don't mention Euler need to be put onto a mock Königsberg and forced to search for a solution. reply gregw134 15 hours agorootparentprevMost people can't name any mathematicians, but amongst those that can I think he's top 5, behind more famous names like Newton, Archimedes and Euclid reply Tainnor 15 hours agorootparentAnd Gauss. reply norir 14 hours agorootparentprevSure, I didn't really mean the general public but meant scientific/mathematically oriented public. When I studied math in college, I found Euler everywhere to the point that it was hard not to stop and wonder how the hell this guy had so many fundamental discoveries. By contrast, I have awareness of present day figures like Tao and Erdos, but I don't really understand their work and perceive it to be specialized enough that it is unlikely to be widely understood in the way that say e^(pi * i) + 1 = 0 is. reply testless 14 hours agoparentprevFor modern mathematics, I think Alexander Grothendieck was one of the most influencial talents in the last century. He unified large branches of mathematics in a very short period. He was more a bird than a frog [1], however.

Judging by the volume of work and the pleasure he takes in collaborations, Terence Tao seems to be having a positive impact. I am not a mathematician but I hear good things about the quality of his work. reply karmakurtisaani 13 hours agorootparent> I am not a mathematician but I hear good things about the quality of his work. Not to be rude, but saying this about a Fields medallist is somehow very funny. reply OldGuyInTheClub 13 hours agorootparentI can see that. But, there are often controversies about who gets what award, even up to the Nobels. Since there are very highly qualified people posting here, I just wanted to be clear that I have no ability to understand Tao's work and am going by acclaim. reply ufocia 17 hours agoparentprevMaybe today's emphasis on \"well rounded\" education is a distraction from specialized talents. reply jterrys 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely HARD disagree. Pythagoras, Aristotle, Pascal, Descartes, Newton, Franklin, DaVinci, (just to name a few) were all polymaths. They all left lasting impacts outside of a singular domain. It's because they were such well rounded individuals that they were so successful and capable of revolutionary discoveries and inventions. Our world is made up of models that are related with other models that are related based off of that relatedness. It's maddening. Being \"well rounded\" is vital. Today that concept is watered down. A \"well rounded\" education is just taking a few classes that people hate and will blow off because to graduate they need to check some boxes so they can focus on doing one thing moderately well and finding their place as a cog in a machine that will abuse their ignorance. It's all mass produced conveyor belt education that manufactures young adults with little conventional wisdom. The more you lean into behaving like a part, the more you will be treated that way. reply chongli 15 hours agorootparentprevEuler did his master’s dissertation on the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. He then joined the faculty at University of Basel in theology. I think this is ample evidence that he received a well-rounded education. reply jacobolus 13 hours agorootparentNot to mention his day job for a while as the chief cartographer in the Russian Empire. reply The_Colonel 16 hours agorootparentprevSpecializing is actually the \"easier\" path, and thus there isn't a lot of low hanging fruit anymore. There are more opportunities in the intersections of different fields (areas of mathematics). reply mhh__ 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's more that mathematics is solely consumed inside \"mathematics for engineering 101\" spread across N years. reply Duanemclemore 14 hours agorootparentprevEuler was nothing if not diverse. Having a \"liberal arts\" / \"great books\" education from high school I have (anecdotal) first hand evidence in the impressive successes of my classmates in a WIDE variety of fields. reply Duanemclemore 16 hours agoparentprevIf not \"low-hanging fruit\" at least \"first mover advantage.\" reply CamperBob2 15 hours agoparentprevStephen Wolfram's agent on line 2... reply jiggawatts 10 hours agoparentprevReminds me of the early days of computer science, the 60s and 70s. I once casually flipped through the CS journal papers archived in my university library, and those two decades were really fascinating. 1) All of the papers were simple, clear, and easy to follow. No greek symbols, no fancy maths, just straighforward pseudocode. 2) The algorithms being presented were new at the time, but were rather trivial, and could have been invented by any of us. They just hadn't been invented, formalised, and written down yet. It was basically a race starting from zero, and nobody had taken very many steps yet. 3) Every new algorithm was such a huge leap that it unlocked many new avenues of advancement for other algorithms. There was a period where it was a race of publishing these follow-up developments nearly as fast as people could type. For a modern example of this, look at the pace of progress of generative AI such as LLMs and Diffusion Models. The first papers were almost trivial, but that \"one clever trick\" unlocked many more ideas and the rate of publication over the last twelve months has been insane. A lot of low-hanging fruit, a lot of road-blocks suddenly removed, etc... reply arjun_krishna1 17 hours agoparentprevKarpathy! Carmack! reply bowsamic 17 hours agorootparentCarmack? I love him but that can’t be a serious suggestion reply croutons 16 hours agorootparentYeah Carmack is no doubt a 20x engineer, but I wouldn’t put him in the same category of prolific genius as Euler. As far as prolific engineers go, I’d say Fabrice Bellard would be closer (but still not even close) to an Euler. reply seanhunter 17 hours agoprevEuler's wikipedia page has one of the most casually jawdropping sentences I've ever read about a human being: \"Euler's work averages 800 pages a year from 1725 to 1783. He also wrote over 4500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts. It has been estimated that Leonard Euler was the author of a quarter of the combined output in mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18th century.\" A quarter of all the output in so many fields. For a whole century. When you think about everyone else who was contributing to science at that time. It's just completely staggering. reply rigid 17 hours agoparentI always stress how our public education is broken since it can't handle extreme talent very good. Important breakthroughs that advance one or more fields extremely or shifting paradigms completely, were done or prepared by whizzkids. In these times, we need every whizzkid we can get. reply kenjackson 16 hours agorootparentNo system will handle an Euler well. It’s best to recognize them and move them out of the system. reply marshray 3 hours agorootparentThat sounds like a good system. reply rigid 12 hours agorootparentprevYou're basically saying the system is obsolete when society reaches a point, where it needs no more mediocre generalists and only excellent specialists. I wouldn't be so pessimistic. reply pohl 11 hours agorootparentThat's the least charitable interpretation, I think. A more charitable read is that no system should be one-size-fits-all, so move outliers to specialized subsystems. reply rigid 44 minutes agorootparentNot sure. In Germany there's an ongoing debate for extending conprehensive schools [1] across all ages. It's a complex topic but the general gist of supporters is, that pupils profit from each other. (e.g. Bad ones get help from the good while those practice how to cooperate and explain etc.). I don't think it's that complex. My personal premises are * if the kid doesn't like to get up and go to school or is too tired over longer periods, the school is doing something wrong, not the kid. * if there are A LOT of kids like this, the school authority is doing something wrong (and so on, up to government) * an older kid needs support on every topic at any time when interest arises. It's the kids' choice not the schools'. * learning at school must be fun, at least 90% of the time. That way whizzkids are easily detected, will be less frustrated and thus perform better. I got some good example anecdotes but better won't \"textwall\" here :-) Just imagine a world, where Einstein would get optimum support from young age so he would start professional physics years earlier. Or one where he didn't go to the patent office but one where he worked in some factory or other place, not finding the spare time he needed to do physics. Way too much luck involved if you ask me. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school reply truckerbill 17 hours agorootparentprevEducation is a cog/mandarin factory in most countries. Whizzkids will educate themselves, what's needed is giving people idle time in order to pursue things. Most influential thinkers found themselves with this in some fashion. How much talent is wasted making people jump through hoops in academia/finance/ad-tech? A lot of pre-industrial thinkers were associated with the clergy because they received tax money from peasants. reply cyberax 15 hours agorootparentOne thing (in retrospect) that I love about the xUSSR school system, is its focus on competitive math and physics. There's a robust multi-level system of \"Olympiads\", starting from the neighborhood level, and going all the way up to the national level. Every student knows about them, and more importantly, \"magnet schools\" scoop up students who do well in competitions. This works really well for math, and so pretty much every Fields medal award ceremony has awardees from the xUSSR countries. I'm really surprised that this kind of system is not more widespread, especially in the US. After all, sports and competition is kinda a thing here? reply johngossman 17 hours agorootparentprevReading Leo Szilard biography right now. School was easy and he just read all the time on his own.

Can't go off reading about differential geometry when you need a guaranteed perfect SAT, a great entrance essay (i.e. a strong personal story), and easy-to-gauge extracurriculars (\"placed X in Y\", not \"read some smart books and had some interesting thoughts that don't impress the admissions officer\"). Same goes for the industry and academia as well. reply programjames 13 hours agorootparentI think top schools are much more likely to accept that kid with a 1550 on the SAT who spent his downtime studying differential geometry instead of the SAT. reply rigid 12 hours agorootparentprev> Whizzkids will educate themselves Only those you see becoming one. You never hear of all the \"Einsteins\" who never leave the patents office because they never got inspired for some passion or various other stupid reasons. reply testless 15 hours agorootparentprevLet's hope education indivualizes to the need and talents of the individual partially via software.

We need less of all that BS. People are thinking that are being \"tutored\" by AI, when in fact is just the output of a number crunching program.

While I'm skeptical about the potential of LLMs as AGI (whatever that means), being able to summarize subjects and even come up with test questions can be very valuable for learning. I am concerned about the confabulation aspect, though. I wonder if there could be a uncertainty metric for that. reply testless 14 hours agorootparentprevHappy to disagree here. I am hopeful that students get apps which provide them with - fast feedback loops - better adjustment to their learning speed - more patience - gamification - oppurtunity to ask endless questions Of course, only as an addition to the current mix. For math problems, this will be easier than for other contexts. I like text books for pop science or really hard things - like university level education. But I am surprised to see them as an option for basic education. reply CamperBob2 9 hours agorootparentprevYou're making a serious mistake.

But to be really scared of the man you can consider that during the later years of his life he lost eyesight, first in one eye, then went completely blind. All without slowing down.

Scribes would just sit and he would talk while they wrote.

He eventually became almost blind entirely, but with the aid of scribes, his productivity actually increased. It's remarkable how Euler didn't let being blind hinder him. A truly astounding mathematical career. reply agnosticmantis 14 hours agoprevWhat I really like and admire about Euler is how masterfully he handled infinities and infinitesimals to arrive at correct conclusions (the vast majority of times anyway) even though analysis hadn’t been made rigorous yet (by Cauchy and Weierstrass and friends), so some of what he did was pure magic and took a lot of good intuition. An example of this is when, in solving the then notorious Basel problem, he factors trig functions into infinite products of (x +- k*pi) terms just by analogy with root factorization in finite polynomials. reply pohl 11 hours agoprevMy favorite thing from Euler's body of work is the circle-of-fifths on steroids, the tonnetz. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nidHgLA2UB0 reply smokel 16 hours agoprevIs it possible that these prolific geniuses had smart people working for (or with) them, while taking most credit?

How would one go about disproving such an hypothesis? I've had similar doubts about Leonardo da Vinci, but I'm afraid Euler was actually just brilliant. reply oglop 11 hours agoparentThere's ample evidence from the time that rather than take credit, as _many_ unethical scientists have tried (*cough Newton), Euler was quite the opposite. I think one of his strengths was in his prolific collaborations actually, or taking up questions others sent to him which he did not need to work on, but would out of curiosity or decency.

I'm always a bit perplexed he doesn't get more credit for this given he wrote some of the first calculus books people could read, because Newton had not cared or tried to. So in many ways Euler was also just an incredible educator and largely lead the charge spreading many of these new ideas. Usually credit is given to Chatelet, but she didn't really write any textbooks, just a commentary to help spread Newton's mechanics. Euler actually wrote the first bona-fide textbook on the matter. Laplace was being literal when he said \"Read Euler, read Euler, read Euler\". I own a copy of his \"Elements of Algebra\" and it's interesting to read because he actually talks and uses the notion of infinitesimals in this basic algebra book. And it makes sense! He essentially just says \"think of the biggest number, make it even bigger!!!

    "originBody": "NEWS FEATURE 23 January 2024 Can autoimmune diseases be cured? Scientists see hope at last After decades of frustration and failed attempts, scientists might finally be on the cusp of developing therapies to restore immune ‘tolerance’ in conditions such as diabetes, lupus and multiple sclerosis. By Cassandra Willyard Twitter Facebook Email Antigen presenting cells (illustrated, right) can sometimes train T cells (left) not to attack. Credit: Juan Gaertner/Science Photo Library Back in 2001, immunologist Pere Santamaria was exploring a new way to study diabetes. Working in mice, he and his collaborators developed a method that uses iron oxide nanoparticles to track the key immune cells involved in the disorder. But then Santamaria, who is at the University of Calgary in Canada, came up with a bold idea. Maybe he could use these particles as a therapy to target and quiet, or even kill, the cells responsible for driving the disease — those that destroy insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. It seemed like a far-fetched idea, but he decided to try it. “I kept doing experiment after experiment,” he says. Now, more than two decades later, Santamaria’s therapy is on the cusp of being tested in people. It’s not alone. Researchers have been trying for more than 50 years to tame the cells that are responsible for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, lupus and multiple sclerosis. Most of the approved therapies for these conditions work by suppressing the entire immune response. This often alleviates symptoms but leaves people at elevated risk of infections and cancers. But for decades, immunologists have hoped to restore what’s known as tolerance — the immune system’s ability to ignore antigens that belong in the body while appropriately attacking those that don’t. In some cases, that means administering the very antigens that the rogue cells are trained to attack, a strategy that can deprogram the cells and dampen the autoimmune response. Other researchers are trying to selectively wipe out the problematic cells, or to introduce suppressive immune cells that have been engineered to target them. One approach that relies on engineered immune cells was used to treat 15 people with lupus or other immune disorders with surprising success1. One participant has been symptom-free for more than two and a half years. If more trials in people show positive results, it could change lives, says Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who specializes in autoimmune disorders. “The therapies that we have for these diseases are terrible,” he says. They don’t always work, and even when they do, the improvement is often modest. Talking about therapies that could provide a cure is “almost blasphemy”, Konig says. Now, with some of the results coming in, curative treatments seem possible. “The only question is, what is the best approach?” he asks. Self awareness The immune system is known for its role in attacking pathogens. But it has another, equally important job: knowing when to stand down. If immune cells see the body’s own tissues as a threat, they can cause harm. The arm of the immune system engaged in targeted attacks consists of cells called lymphocytes that differentiate to form T cells, which typically recognize and attack foreign or diseased cells, and B cells, which produce antibodies and support the immune system in other ways. Early in their development, these cells undergo a process to weed out those that target the body’s own tissues. But this process, known as central tolerance, is “leaky”, says Jeffrey Hubbell, a chemical engineer at the University of Chicago in Illinois. Some cells slip through. ‘It’s all gone’: CAR-T therapy forces autoimmune diseases into remission The body has a backup system, a mechanism known as peripheral tolerance. This eliminates or deactivates wayward cells, or turns them into what are known as regulatory T cells, which suppress the immune response by preventing other cells from attacking. In autoimmune diseases, both central and peripheral tolerance break down for reasons that are not entirely understood, and the immune system starts attacking antigens found on the body’s own cells and tissue. In multiple sclerosis, the body attacks the myelin sheath that insulates nerves. In coeliac disease, gluten triggers the immune system to attack the intestinal lining. If scientists could calm or eliminate the malfunctioning cells — restoring tolerance to specific antigens — they could treat the disease without hampering the immune system’s ability to respond to real threats. Early efforts focused on administering large quantities of the problematic antigen in an attempt to exhaust or deactivate the immune cells that recognize it. Many groups have tried this form of desensitization, with varying levels of success. The antigen must be introduced in just the right way, to boost tolerance rather than activate immunity, says Jeffrey Bluestone, an immunologist and chief executive and co-founder of Sonoma Biotherapeutics in South San Francisco, California. “That’s the whole field of antigen-specific therapy.” Flipping the switch Picking the right antigen is tricky. Some autoimmune diseases are caused by a reaction to just one. But for many conditions — multiple sclerosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few — the body develops an immune response against several antigens through a phenomenon called epitope spreading. Researchers could try to work out all the antigens involved, Bluestone says. But that’s a tall order, especially because the list might vary from person to person. Another possibility is to search for a master switch that, when flipped, turns off the autoimmune response while leaving the immune system intact. Santamaria thinks that he has found such a mechanism. His team’s nanoparticles — which he calls navacims — are decorated with proteins called major histocompatibility complex molecules that jut off the surface of the particle like spikes. These spikes are meant to mimic those found on immune regulatory cells known as antigen-presenting cells, which mop up antigens all over the body and then take them to T cells, telling the cells whether to attack or ignore them (see ‘Pathways to tolerance’). Santamaria likens them to T-cell bait. Sources: Liver: Ref. 4; Nanoparticles: Y. Yang & P. Santamaria Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 176, 113898 (2021); CAAR: Ref. 6 After Santamaria discovered how to use the navacims to track T cells, he began working out how to use them as a therapy. He suspected that the nanoparticles might cause the cells to die or go dormant. At the time, Santamaria was working with a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, a disease in which epitope spreading is known to occur. So, he developed a cocktail of particles carrying eight different antigen fragments, or epitopes. For a control, he used a nanoparticle carrying a single epitope, surmising that one wouldn’t have any effect because T cells recognize thousands of epitopes in diabetes. Surprisingly, however, both the control and the experimental nanoparticles reversed diabetes symptoms. “It totally didn’t make any sense,” Santamaria says. It took him years to work out what was going on, but now he thinks he understands2,3. The nanoparticles prompt T cells to multiply and morph into regulatory T cells, which travel to the site of inflammation. There, they bind and deactivate antigen-presenting cells that carry not only the antigen that these cells recognize, but thousands of other antigens that are important in diabetes. So these cells can no longer activate the immune cells that fuel the disease. In a sense, the nanoparticle-fused antigen works as a master switch. “It sounds too good to be true sometimes,” Santamaria says. And it might be. The strategy hasn’t been tested in the clinic yet. Santamaria has founded a company called Parvus Therapeutics in South San Francisco; it should begin its first trial in people this year, starting with an autoimmune disease that affects the liver. A key in the liver The liver is where all the blood carrying foreign antigens from the gut gets filtered. It is also the destination of all the cellular debris left behind when cells and tissues die. It, therefore, has an important role in establishing immune tolerance. Hubbell and his colleagues discovered that cellular debris carries a special sugar tag that directs it to the liver. By adding this sugar tag to other proteins, they realized, they could direct just about any molecule they wanted to the liver, including antigens such as the myelin proteins that activate the immune system in multiple sclerosis. In work published in 2023, they showed that this strategy works to reverse symptoms of a multiple-sclerosis-like disease in mice4. What was so exciting about this paper, Hubbell says, is that the animals had advanced disease, meaning that their immune systems were probably reacting against a variety of antigens. Yet, treatment with just one antigen worked to reverse paralysis. Your brain could be controlling how sick you get — and how you recover A company called Anokion in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which Hubbell co-founded, is working on a similar strategy. It has tested it in a phase I trial in people with multiple sclerosis to assess its safety, and is currently enrolling participants in a phase II trial, in which it will start to assess the efficacy. The firm’s chief executive, Deborah Geraghty, won’t say exactly how the therapy works after the antigen travels to the liver. “We haven’t disclosed a lot of that publicly,” she says, but she adds, “We believe we’re driving a strong T-regulatory component.” Bluestone has decided on a different approach. He and his colleagues at Sonoma Biotherapeutics take T cells from patients’ blood, extract the regulatory cells, and engineer them to express an antigen that will direct the regulatory T cells to the site of disease when they are re-injected. There, they should be able to calm all the angry T cells in the vicinity, not just those that recognize the specific antigen they carry. Sonoma has tested regulatory T cells in clinical trials, but not those cells engineered to express a specific antigen, yet. It plans to give the first dose to a person with rheumatoid arthritis in early 2024. Bluestone thinks that the approach is less risky than dosing people with antigens that might further exacerbate autoimmunity. And regulatory T cells produce tissue-repair factors, which might help to reverse some of the damage wrought by disease. But cellular therapies also come with challenges, including a high cost and potential side effects. “These are living drugs,” Bluestone says. How do you determine a dose for cells that, once infused, begin replicating in the body? “There’s a lot we still need to learn.” B cells in the spotlight While researchers such as Bluestone and Hubbell are working to prod the immune system towards tolerance, others are developing therapies to directly kill the immune cells that contribute to the disease. One team in Germany is trying an approach commonly used to treat blood cancers that equips T cells with what’s known as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Clinicians take T cells from the patient’s body and engineer them to express this specialized synthetic receptor on their surface. They can create a CAR that binds to CD-19, a protein found on all B cells. Clinicians then infuse the CAR T cells into the body, where they start attacking B cells. How a pioneering diabetes drug offers hope for preventing autoimmune disorders So far, the researchers have presented results for a total of 15 people: 8 with lupus; 4 with systemic sclerosis, which affects connective tissue; and 3 with idiopathic inflammatory myositis, which causes muscle inflammation and weakness. People’s symptoms improved dramatically. But what’s most surprising is that they have all stayed in remission, even after they began producing new B cells. It’s as if wiping out the B cells performed a reset on the immune system5. “The results are mind blowing, boggling, outstanding,” says Lawrence Steinman, a neuroimmunologist at Stanford University in California, who many call the father of antigen-specific therapy. The first participant in the study, who had lupus, passed the 1,000-day mark in December with no sign of disease. Konig agrees that the results are “incredible”:“Most people would not have predicted the degree of durability.” But, he adds, “I don’t think we can expect that the disease will stay gone forever in every patient.” The T cells that help to drive lupus are still there. CAR-T therapies target and kill all B cells, which might make it a stretch to consider the approach a way of restoring tolerance. But for most autoimmune diseases, only a small fraction of B cells are the trouble makers. Aimee Payne, a dermatologist at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, wanted to find a way to target just those cells. She studies a rare skin disease called mucosal pemphigus vulgaris. In people with this disease, the immune system makes antibodies against a protein in the skin called desmoglein 3. “It’s responsible essentially for holding your epithelial cells together,” she says. “The cells fall apart and you get blisters all throughout the mucosa [and] on the skin.” The standard therapy for pemphigus, a monoclonal antibody, works by destroying B cells. With the B cells gone, the antibodies against desmoglein 3 disappear, and people go into remission. “Our current therapies are really a blunt weapon,” Payne says. Payne realized that she might be able to develop a more focused weapon by tweaking the CAR-T approach. Rather than engineering a T-cell receptor that would bind to all B cells, she could engineer the T cells to express the desmoglein 3 protein, which would bind to the desmoglein 3 antibodies sticking off the surface of only the rogue B cells6. This therapy is known as CAAR (chimeric autoantibody receptor) T cell. “It’s like a laser,” she says, “targeting the autoreactive B cells that are causing disease, but leaving the healthy B cells alone.” The race to supercharge cancer-fighting T cells Payne founded a company called Cabaletta Bio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is currently testing these cells in people with pemphigus and another autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis that causes muscle weakness. B cells are emerging as a promising target in many autoimmune diseases, says Payne. In some of the most common disorders, B cells have complex roles. They don’t just produce antibodies but also churn out signals that trigger inflammation and present antigens to T cells, helping to fan the flames that keep autoimmune diseases burning. In immunology, “everybody focused on T cells because they were the smart ones and B cells were just like the poor cousin”, Payne says, but “maybe B cells really are like the key”. Steinman is careful not to be too optimistic. He has invested decades in approaches directed at immune tolerance. “Every time these are taken to the clinic, including some of my own efforts, they fall short of getting a drug approval,” he says. At this point, he adds, “I would want to hedge my bets.” Santamaria suggests that many past failures stem from a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. “I think they fail because they’re going to into clinical testing before we actually know what the hell we’re doing,” he says. Now, 18 years into his research on navacims, he thinks that his team has a good shot at success. Konig favours approaches that involve B-cell depletion. That’s the strategy that his team is working on, so he accepts that he might be biased. “The beauty is that eventually we’ll learn from the data what the right approach is.” Nature 625, 646-648 (2024) doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00169-7 References Mueller, F. et al.

I'm not some \"big pharma bad\" person, but something about those medications have never sat well with me. I suppose for many, the risk of the cure outweighs the risk of the disease.

However, I do have many of signs that have a high correlation with such outcomes. =( The cancer is not my concern. For my disease in particular, the research, from what I have read, seems to believe that biologics do not increase the rate of cancer more than what the AI disease already does. Some studies have shown that there might even be a decrease in cancer once inflammation is controlled. With that being said, it's the other potential side-effects like new incidents of Demyelinating diseases, Lupus-Like Reactions, seizures, liver damage, heart failure, etc..

Until this is lumped in with the other innovations that a mere carrots on a stick like a cure for cancer, material that can replace plastic without compromise, flying cars, ability to regrow enamel/reverse dental caries, etc.. reply voisin 12 hours agoprevWhat’s the best way to track research, RSS-style, rather than manually doing searches and hoping you see follow ups? reply fabian2k 12 hours agoparentPubmed is the database you'd typically want to look at for medical and natural sciences. You can configure email alerts for specific keywords there, though it's been ages that I've done that. reply wcarss 11 hours agorootparentThis is the specific kind of thing I want to use LLMs for. I want to describe \"what I'm looking for\" to an LLM and have it go out each week and digest the most recent 100 papers, and occasionally pop up to tell me when there's something potentially relevant to read. reply sydd 10 hours agorootparentprevWhile you could do that it would just give you false hope. Pubmed contains research from all areas of natural sciences, and you need to get used to the wording to know feasible the claims of an article are. Some examples: - Usually research goes in vitro (in a petri dish) -> in animals -> in humans. An article can claim that they've found the cure for cancer, if its just in vitro it doesnt mean much. The medicine needs to go to the right place, it should not have too bad side effects,...a very small percentage of medicine that works in vitro makes it to human testing. - even if it works in humans it might not be feasible to manufacture it. We have got medicine that costs over 3 million USD per dose, obviously there is a cost when the manufacturer just scraps the project even if it works perfectly. reply voisin 8 hours agorootparentprevThank you! I didn’t realize Pubmed had these options. I just found that it has “Create an RSS feed” of any search ter, which is fantastic. Thanks for the pointer! reply eaurouge 11 hours agoprev> But what’s most surprising is that they have all stayed in remission, even after they began producing new B cells. It’s as if wiping out the B cells performed a reset on the immune system. Apparently repeated cycles of prolonged fasts can also trigger apoptosis and reset the immune system. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474734/ reply jbm 13 hours agoprevMy first thought was whether this could help with allergies; this seems to be a much, much bigger group of people. Sadly it didn't seem to come up in the article. Oh and yay University of Calgary! reply kelnos 12 hours agoparentIt seems like one of the approaches they are looking into is very similar to an existing treatment for allergies, at least on the surface: > In some cases, that means administering the very antigens that the rogue cells are trained to attack, a strategy that can deprogram the cells and dampen the autoimmune response. I go to my allergist every month to get three shots under my skin, which are cocktails of concentrated versions of the various things I'm allergic to. It's been almost 3.5 years since I started, and while my allergies are certainly better than they used to be, they're far from \"cured\". I don't really expect further improvement; I'm supposed to do another year and a half in order to increase the chances of it \"sticking\" for longer. But even then, some patients report their allergies come back in full force in anywhere between 5 and 20 years. But they are also looking into: > Other researchers are trying to selectively wipe out the problematic cells, or to introduce suppressive immune cells that have been engineered to target them. ... which I personally think is much more promising, if possibly much more difficult to accomplish. reply ahstilde 12 hours agoprevTechnically, allergies are an autoimmune disease, and they're certainly effectively curable through a change in the immune response. We're increasing the availability of allergy immunotherapy with our company, Wyndly. https://www.wyndly.com/pages/immunotherapy I'd love to see this for more conditions. reply anonymouskimmer 11 hours agoparentIs it medically possible to make a combination sublingual drop for a variety of common allergies without side-effects? $250 for a test and then whatever payments to have a doctor prescribe it is out of reach for many. A single over-the-counter for the more common allergies, or even regional over-the-counters for regional allergens, would be reach a lot more people. For the serious allergic reactions I can see why a personalized plan would be required. But for the more mild reactions this seems hypothetically possible. Aside: If wondered for a bit whether something like honey blends of many regional honeys for young children older than 6 months would eliminate most of the seasonal pollen allergies that people develop from moving to other parts of the country/world. Edit to add: I believe you're wrong about the \"technically\" part. Allergies aren't attacking the body (therefore not \"auto\"), merely causing symptoms through the general immune response against the allergen. This is particularly aggravating to an individual because the immune response is long lasting, as it's impossible for the immune system to eliminate the foreign antigen when said antigen is prevalent in the environment. reply aitchnyu 4 hours agorootparentI doubt it can be OTC. My sublingual immunotherapy was started in doctors office to monitor adverse symptoms and there was a dose ramp up over 4 weeks. reply Metacelsus 11 hours agoparentprev>Technically, allergies are an autoimmune disease No, autoimmune means an immune reaction against a human protein (which allergens are not). reply rewgs 2 hours agoparentprevIs Wyndly targeting food allergies, or just environmental/etc? reply supertofu 6 hours agoprevGosh, I hope so. I have UC (ulcerative colitis), and my quality of life can vary wildly depending on flare-ups. It's a pretty brutal condition, and a horrible way to live if the disease isn't well-managed by meds or other therapies. reply mieubrisse 12 hours agoprevFascinating and informative article. I'm wrestling with an unknown something that looks like it might be autoimmune, and this reads like the difference between \"you're destined to a lifetime of palliative treatments\" vs \"there might be a something you can do to actually cure yourself\". And I don't even have anything confirmed; I can't imagine what folks who actually have a confirmed autoimmune disorder must be feeling. reply josefresco 12 hours agoparentI'm 6ish years into my RA diagnosis. The first 2 years were very rough both physically but more so mentally. I manage the mental aspect better now, and my symptoms have stabilized which certainly helps the former. However it's easy to dip into despair when you know what the long term prospects are for life quality and expectancy. reply notamy 11 hours agoprevThis would be lovely if it pans out. I’ve been grappling with a neurological issue for a while now that might be autoimmune (testing inconclusive so far); fortunately the neurological symptoms are reversible, but having an autoimmune variant of this issue would be life-altering with how treatment progresses. reply epgui 10 hours agoprevVery interesting, and indeed promising, but IMO over-optimistic in the way the approach is presented. reply nullserver 12 hours agoprevSjögrens. Which is similar to Lupus. Diet changes can make a huge difference. Earlier the better. On many support forums I see a pattern of people using the various meds with mixed results. Then people starting to experiment with which foods they seem to do better with. Then discovering the auto immune protocol diet. A lot of people don’t wanna go to the effort, so won’t try it and complain about it. People that try it and actually follow it often have amazing results, and all their symptoms calm down. A lot of people just cannot give up the pizza and chips though. reply supertofu 6 hours agoparentI have UC. I've been experimenting with diet for 2 years now. If this current diet fails, I'll just have to give up. Sure, lots of folks won't change how they eat. But some people really are making radical changes to their diet and still seeing flare-ups. reply hirvi74 11 hours agoparentprevMy issue with the dietary suggestions is that I have yet to see enough conclusive evidence that any of them work (especially long-term). I feel like much of the information is just a Survivorship Bias. Who blogs about the countless diets that failed to help them? My understanding is that even for those who receive positive results, such results are highly anecdotal and individually specific. One person goes vegan and is cured. Another goes on a strictly carnivore diet and is cured. Same can be said for Mediterranean Diet, Plant-based, keto, etc.. So, which one should be recommended? How many should one try before they give up? How long should they try before they give up? \"Nightshades cause inflammation.\" How? Why? At what dosage -- one slick of bell pepper can't be equal to five pounds of tomatoes, right? Why is this an issue only in some people? I am not trying to dismiss the premise because there could be validity to dietary factors impacting disease prognosis, but part of me also wants to believe that if the treatments were as simple as dietary interventions, then a majority of people with AI diseases would be cured already. I refuse to accept the conspiracy that diets hold the hidden cure for a majority of AI diseases, and that Big Pharma and doctors wouldn't profit as much if people made dietary interventions, so that's why they keep people sick with AI diseases by only treating the symptoms. Accepting such would be ignoring that there is also an entire \"Big Diet\" industry that stands to make a profit off the same desperate people. All I am gonna say is that, Dr. Jonas Salk invented the first effective Polio vaccine, did not patent his findings, an thus released it for free so the world could be a better place. Dr. John Pagano apparently discovered a diet that helps treat/cure AI diseases. You can learn more about it for $64.22 on Amazon. reply tigen 9 hours agorootparentSome of these books describe obvious (or at least uncontroversial) things. Like one book describes issues with Celiacs eating wheat in a way that implies it's a general risk for everyone. However diet can clearly affect the gut microbiome which is involved in development of various immune diseases (including allergies). Less clear how it might treat it after the fact, where evidence seems lacking. Diet can clearly affect symptoms/complications. If someone has gut inflammation then different foods (or fasts) can be dramatically more or less compatible, and could potentially improve quality of life or stave off surgery. In general though, expecting too much from diet is likely to cause disease worsening compared to getting on the best drugs. reply m3kw9 8 hours agoprev [–] Maybe we are on our way out of medival style medicine and actually get a cure and stead of attacking it with ball and chain style therapies reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
