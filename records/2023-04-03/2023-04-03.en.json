    "content": "Researchers have discovered that cognitive fatigue, a feeling of exhaustion in response to mental exertion, is caused by an accumulation of glutamate, a certain chemical in the brain underpinning control, when cognitive control is used. The study used magnetic-resonance spectroscopy to measure biochemical changes in the brain and found that when the concentration of glutamate is high, cognitive control weakens, which leads to a decline in performance. This suggests that glutamate is a mechanism for computing a cost-benefit analysis, with fatigue and increased glutamate adding to the cost of mental effort. Despite a lack of known ways to reduce glutamate levels, sleep was cited as the best way to boost brain power naturally.The author shares their struggle with burnout and inability to sustain coding after a failed startup. They express uncertainty about their future, given their lack of marketable skills and homeless status. The comments elaborate on similar experiences and offer support, with one person reflecting on the importance of mental and physical health. The article highlights the potential consequences of overworking and neglecting self-care, as well as the need for community support. The author's story serves as a reminder that everyone has limits and that it's okay to take breaks to prioritize well-being.",

A few moments ago, the death of Ryuichi Sakamoto was confirmed over his social channels. He was 71 years old.Ryuichi Sakamoto was first diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014. While that issue was treated effectively, he later revealed he was suffering from rectal cancer. He played his final show at the end of 2022, and kept fans informed as to his health.   pic.twitter.com/mYLMEN6HrZ\u2014 ryuichi sakamoto (@ryuichisakamoto) April 2, 2023 A classically trained musician, his interest in outsider sounds drew Ryuichi Sakamoto to emerging electronic instruments. Blending a gifted ear for melody with stunning technical abilities, he was drawn into the orbit of Yellow Magic Orchestra.The trio helped pioneer what would become known as City Pop, and laid down the groundwork for electronic pop music as a whole. Vastly influential, Ryuichi Sakamoto continued to build a solo catalogue, including the song \u2018Riot In Lagos\u2019 \u2013 beloved by hip-hop producers, it was a massive influence on electro.Invited to both appear in and score Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, the Japanese artist responded with some of his finest work. Entering a shadow career as a film composer, the narrative thrust and cinematic gleam of his projects \u2013 such as The Last Emperor or the Revenant \u2013 can scarcely be rivalled.    Alongside this, he nurtured creative relationships with a number of anime studios, and his work in this area represents yet another sterling facet to his imagination.An artist who challenged himself to the last, Ryuichi Sakamoto\u2019s most recent album \u201912\u2019 was released to great acclaim earlier this year.An incredible talent, he leaves a singular catalogue of music.\u2014           -           Join the Clash mailing list for up to the minute music, fashion and film news.

Several planks of wood - six I think in this case - are overlaid and pressed into shape by tremendous force for six months. Nature is molded into shape. Many tons of force and pressure are applied, making the strings what they are. Matter taken from nature is molded by human industry, by the sum strength of civilization. Nature is forced into shape. Interestingly, the piano requires re-tuning. We humans say, &#x27;It falls out of tune&#x27;, but that&#x27;s not exactly accurate - matter is struggling to return to a natural state. The tsunami, in one moment, became a force of restoration. The [tsunami-damaged] piano re-tuned by nature actually sounds good to me now. In short, the piano is tuned by force to please our ears or ideals; it&#x27;s a condition that feels natural to us humans. But from nature&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s very unnatural. I think deep inside me somewhere, I have a strong aversion to that.&quot;<p>- Ryuichi Sakamoto', 'My mom was the babysitter of his son (with Norika) for a few years in the 90s. I was around 6-7 years old. I remember Norika as being incredibly kind. She would let my mom bring me to their home often while babysitting their toddler. We had just immigrated from China, so I was decked out in very fobby clothing. Norika took me to The Gap one day and bought a whole new wardrobe for me. I&#x27;m still grateful for her kind gesture 30 years later. I never spoke with Ryuichi. To me, he was just this mysterious man who occasionally showed up at the apartment and would go straight to his studio.', '&quot;An artist&#x27;s initial broad stroke is always most impactful, and obsessively adding layer upon layer of paint to fill in details often diminishes the painting&#x27;s aura. When an aura is lost, it is impossible to get back.&quot; - Ryuichi Sakamoto', 'I had heard him here and there, but the first time I really started paying attention to him was the Zero Landmine[1] project. After that I watched him alongside David Bowie in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence[2] and realized he was the creator of that famous melody. After that I was hooked. Like others in this thread I really love his collaborations with Alva Noto, especially By This River[3]. I&#x27;m sad he&#x27;s gone, but I&#x27;m happy we will always have the great things he created.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_CQXI01usj0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_CQXI01usj0</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AALrrgEOlvU?t=119\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AALrrgEOlvU?t=119</a><p>3. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rTv8m8vjjTk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rTv8m8vjjTk</a>', 'Sad news.

Anyway, Beauty is a favorite album from my childhood so probably time for a re-listen.', 'Sakamoto must have died with a bitter taste in his mouth, watching the government try to restart the nuclear plants under the pretext of power shortage. He had always been a vocal opponent of nuclear power, a rare voice in a country that seemed to have forgotten the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He had a sharp wit and a playful style, but also a deep sense of justice and compassion. He would have hated to see his beloved country go down this path of self-destruction.']",

    "content": "Firefox has completely removed XUL layout from its codebase, meaning the browser UI now uses regular web technology to render. XUL had a lot of issues, including not supporting basic CSS features, interacting poorly with regular layout, being proprietary and poorly documented, and not being actively maintained. Using web technology instead means better performance and bugs that affect the web and Firefox UI affect each other. There were differences between XUL box model and CSS flexbox, but emulation helped to unify them to enable the switch. However, significant work was required to rewrite elements with special XUL behavior implemented as nsBoxFrame subclasses. XUL still has specialness in the DOM around popups and menus.Mozilla deprecated XULRunner, its platform for creating desktop applications with front-ends rendered in the same technology as Firefox\u2019s interface, in 2015. XULRunner was based on JavaScript, XUL, and XPCOM, and Mozilla hoped developers would use them for building cross-platform desktop applications. Unfortunately, few outside Mozilla adopted XULRunner. Some experts mourned its demise, noting that several of its features, such as native-looking interfaces, could be difficult to replicate in other cross-platform development frameworks. Mozilla chose to discontinue support for XULRunner to focus on Firefox's core functionality.",

    "content": "Inkjet printers are often region-locked, causing inconvenience to those who move or travel overseas, as well as those who purchase ink cartridges from other regions. HP, in particular, is notorious for region-locking its printers and cartridges, which has led to frustration and wasted money for its customers. DRM is just one of the many ways printer companies try to squeeze more money out of their customers, including blocking third-party ink cartridges, preventing cartridge refills, and remotely bricking printers if ink subscriptions are canceled. The author spent dozens of hours over five months trying to reset the region lock on his printer, culminating in him calling HP's phone support team.After experiencing issues with their HP printer, the author spends months trying to find a solution with HP support. The process involves multiple phone calls, the exchange of serial numbers, and attempts at different reset codes until finally succeeding to reset the printer region with a key generation utility. The author notes that monochrome laser printers may last forever and have fewer issues than printers with multiple features and ink cartridges. Other commenters share their frustrating experiences with printers and suggest using open-source software and free printers at libraries. Overall, the post highlights the arduous process of resolving printer issues and the dissatisfaction with current printing technology.Complex printer formats create proprietary competing printouts that are inscrutable. Simple bitmap-only printers like the original NeXT machine are better, where PostScript processing is done on the computer side. Region settings on devices are designed to prevent market segmentation, but it leads to frustration for users. Off-brand ink may bypass region locks. Consumer laws protect returning incompatible cartridges and refilling originals. HP printers have issues and are aggressive on pricing, although their market share is high. The EU should investigate manufacturers of consumables-based devices like printers, limiting consumers to forced-expiring, half-empty consumables with DRMs or other anti-consumer rules. Non-DRM ink in refillable reservoirs saves users money.",

That is, the government spends money on things, but this is a very inefficient or even counterproductive way to help. And a lot of the time it just means that the money is going to whoever is politically connected.<p>A much more efficient way to help people is just to give them money directly, and then people can spend it on whatever they think they need.', 'In 2012, the federal government spent $668 billion to fund 126 separate anti\u2010 poverty programs. State and local governments kicked in another $284 billion, bringing total anti\u2010 poverty spending to nearly $1 trillion.

CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared in Grist.\nLast year, U.S. renewable electricity generation surpassed coal for the first time, according to newly released federal data. The report marks a major milestone in the transition to clean energy, but experts say that much faster progress is needed to reach international climate targets.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical agency, combined wind and solar generation increased from 12 percent of national power production in 2021 to 14 percent in 2022. Hydropower, biomass, and geothermal added another 7 percent \u2014 for a total share of 21 percent renewables last year. The figure narrowly exceeded coal\u2019s 20 percent share of electricity generation, which fell from 23 percent in 2021.\u00a0\nThe growth in renewable electricity was largely driven by a surge in added wind and solar capacity, the agency said. Texas was the top wind-generating state last year, producing more than a quarter of all U.S. wind generation. It was also the leading state for natural gas and coal power. Iowa and Oklahoma landed at second and third in wind generation, accounting for 10 percent and 9 percent of national wind power respectively.\u00a0\nCalifornia took the lead in solar, clocking in with 26 percent of the nation\u2019s solar electricity. Texas came in second at 16 percent, followed by North Carolina at 8 percent. Renewable generation also exceeded nuclear for the second year in a row, after surging ahead for the first time in 2021.\u00a0\nBut the report found that fossil fuels still dominate the country\u2019s energy mix. Natural gas remained the top source of electricity in the U.S. \u2014 its share rose from 37 percent of electricity generation in 2021 to 39 percent in 2022.\u00a0\nFor 2023, the Energy Information Administration forecasts additional growth in renewables. The agency predicts wind power will increase from 11 percent to 12 percent of total power generation this year. Solar is projected to rise from 4 percent to 5 percent. Coal is expected to further decline from 20 percent to 17 percent. Meanwhile, natural gas generation is expected to remain unchanged.\nDespite the encouraging news, some energy experts say the uptick in renewables still isn\u2019t fast enough. On Tuesday, the International Renewable Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization, announced that global annual investments in renewables need to more than quadruple to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The assessment echoes the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s top climate science body, which called for a rapid scale-down of greenhouse gas emissions largely produced from fossil fuels.\u00a0\nMelissa Lott, director of research for the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, told the Associated Press that the $369 billion in clean energy spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act should have a \u201ctremendous\u201d impact on further accelerating domestic renewable energy growth. But to reach that potential, the U.S. may need new policies to remove hurdles that stand in the way of building new clean energy infrastructure.\u00a0\nIn the United States, rapid deployment of renewable energy has been hindered by practical barriers including delays in connecting projects to aging electric grids. At the end of 2021, thousands of wind, solar, and battery storage projects were waiting to connect to grids across the country. According to data from the Department of Energy, less than 20 percent of wind and solar projects waiting to be connected are successfully completed. And even when projects are approved, developers often discover they need to pay for new transmission lines to deliver power to residents and businesses. Those transmission lines often face further permitting delays.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how cheap the clean energy is,\u201d Spencer Nelson, the managing director of research at the nonprofit ClearPath Foundation, recently told the New York Times. \u201cIf developers can\u2019t get through the interconnection process quickly enough and get enough steel in the ground, we won\u2019t hit our climate change goals.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in Grist.

Energy is NOT power.  Reporting on energy (which is what the original publication does; and even they confuse it) is almost pointless.<p>We need power.  Not energy.<p>Let me explain.  There is no such thing as a useful measure of energy reliability.  Energy is the accumulation of power over time.  Here&#x27;s a super simplistic example to illustrate the point:<p>You spend all day walking through the desert.  Your water bottle is empty.  You drank it all.  You really need water, yet there&#x27;s none to be found.  You nearly die a few times, yet manage to make it out to a settlement by nightfall.<p>Someone there fills your bottle with water.<p>A reporter says your bottle, over that 24 hour period, was full.<p>That&#x27;s the way you compute energy.  You can have zero power for 12 hours and then have some for another 12.  Energy just adds-up all the bits of power you had over 24 hours and reports it as one number.<p>Energy comparisons are useless.<p>Here&#x27;s reality:<p>Solar is, nominally, about 50% reliable (if this term isn&#x27;t comfortable, think &quot;available&quot;).<p>No?<p>It turns off at night.<p>Roughly 50% of the time...it does not work.<p>Wind, on the other hand, does not suffer from this issue.  It is much more reliable.<p>With the addition of a nominal amount of storage wind can easily get up to 95% reliability.  Solar, with the same amount of storage, runs about 70% reliability.<p>This is about power delivery.  Consistent.  Water bottle in the desert, to use when you need water.<p>Ignoring all other factors (environmental, wildlife, NIMBY, noise, etc.), wind is a far better technology than solar.<p>Yet, again, to pull this back into the realm of what we should discussing:  We need to talk about power, not energy.  When you go to charge your electric car at the same time a million other people want to do the same thing, you need power.']",

So they will spend all their time engineering the perfect blog site from scratch or moving from platform to platform looking for an ideological fit while no one really cares about consuming any of their output.<p>My advice is always to forget about the details and just write. Set up a medium account, or substack, or blogspot, or get a VPS and install Wordpress or Ghost, or just tweet out your article line by line. If there is value in what you write then the readers will be there. And they will follow you if you decide to move your work elsewhere in the future.', 'The best solution is what the Indieweb folks called POSSE: Publish on your Own Site , Syndicate Elsewhere:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indieweb.org&#x2F;POSSE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indieweb.org&#x2F;POSSE</a><p>For instance, I might publish a clip on my own site first, then mirror it to places like YouTube, TikTok and Reddit so more people find it. Or post an article on my own site first, then repost it on Medium and Substack (with a canonical saying my own version is the original if possible).<p>That way you&#x27;re not tied to a specific platform, and can just find another place to share&#x2F;post your work if any of them go to hell.', 'List of reasons why this is very narrow minded:<p>1. You still own your work if you post it other places, just not the platform.<p>2. You own the platform if you host it on a VPS, but not the hardware.<p>3. You own the hardware if you host it at home, but still, only license the software which runs it.<p>4. Many more.<p>You want real advice? Ignore this guy, and just start. Most of you people concerned on where you should start blogging&#x2F;pocasting don&#x27;t even start because of all the choices and the fearmongering (like this guy).<p>Just write something and hit send. Not doing that is the only guarantee of failure. Everything else is fixable.', 'Counterpoint - this is a bit like saying &quot;sell the product from your own website, you&#x27;ll get 100% of the sales and own the customer!&quot;<p>Totally true, but good luck getting the customer to your site. Way easier to put your product on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, wherever people are already shopping AS WELL - and take a hit on profit (at least initially) and figure out how you build off that.<p>Leverage all the social media and blog sites and substacks and whatever that you can. Build a base and then figure it out from there.', 'And then you die, and you stop paying for your own web host, and it all goes away anyway, more easily than if you had posted on Medium or whatever (because if you&#x27;re still alive you could keep migrating&#x2F;syndicating your data to other services if they go under).<p>That basically happened with James Mathe. He was the owner of Minion Games, and he had an incredible tome of board game publishing on Kickstarter advice on his blog.<p>He died suddenly one day in 2019, and his self-hosted site went under. You can still read it to a certain extent thanks to archive.org[1], but as thankful as I am for archive.org, they don&#x27;t have the best user experience.<p>Meanwhile if he had posted it on blogspot or on BoardGameGeek (which supports user blogs), it&#x27;d still be fully available today.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to have a self-hosting solution, but I think you also need an alternative. The POSSE solution mentioned above would be better than only self-hosting.<p>Ideally these websites would have better data preservation and archiving processes, though, and too many just don&#x27;t have anything in place. Because you&#x27;re just not going to be able to convince everyone to host their own.<p>I&#x27;d settle for automatic conversion to text-only archives, that could be good enough while making the required space much more miniscule.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190617212658&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamesmathe.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190617212658&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamesm...</a>', 'What is old is new again<p>This was basically the only option in the early 90s before geocities etc...

That isn&#x27;t the case just yet. If we moved to a more API first world then it would be very much possible. With the advent of GPT related stuff it&#x27;s clear we&#x27;re going that direction and the interface for everything is changing too. So the concept of what is your website might fundamentally change too.', 'Instead of a Wordpress Blog or something I&#x27;d go for something static. There is a couple of software solutions out there from everything to blogs to website. This has the benefit that you can be a lot more independent. As long as you have some copy somewhere you are fine. You can back it up easily and so on. If you use WP (and MySQL) a lot more things can go wrong. If the MySQL server, your wordpress can get hacked for some silly plugin you thought you needed, the hoster of it or whatever are unavailable you might lose it, you might lose your domain which can break stuff, you might forget to pay, etc.<p>The idea here is something that allows you quick recreation and copying. You can just copy over static files. You can put it on your Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. and even on your external hard disk or whatever backup solution you use.<p>Usually the main dynamic thing for writers is actually creating posts. So if that is some offline software that just spits out static files it becomes incredibly resilient.<p>One might think static site generators, like Hugo, but there is also GUI applications that essentially equal what the admin of a blog or CMS see.', '&quot;You\u2019ll own everything, and it\u2019ll be yours forever.&quot;<p>This is overstating it.

Instead of the civil service being an assemblage of people with different skill-sets, it instead consists chiefly of administrators with no more skills than a high-school graduate (although they do have tertiary degrees). Jobs which require actual skill are then farmed out to contractors by these &#x27;generalists&#x27;.<p>The problem is baked into the pay structure, which tends to be based on seniority and how many people you manage rather than skill. You can&#x27;t just up salaries across the board because then you&#x27;d be paying all the unskilled &#x27;generalists&#x27; far too much.<p>They need to completely reorient the civil service away from the notion of generalists, because they&#x27;re not true generalists. If someone can&#x27;t code in this day and age they&#x27;re not a generalist. And if they have no other specialist skill-set besides (say law or accounting) then they shouldn&#x27;t even be considered professionals. What we have today is a civil service made of pseudo-professionals who in fact do exactly the same sort of work once done by much cheaper clerical staff.', 'I get a lot job offers in my LinkedIn inbox and newsletters from places like glass door as I like to keep my eye on the market. One thing I\u2019ve been seeing a lot recently is salaries for dev roles steadily dropping in the UK.<p>The concerning thing, in my opinion, is that the poster linked by OP seems disillusioned as to the standard of living in the UK. They specifically mention being paid \u00a355k as being equivalent to $100k in the US. It isn\u2019t.<p>\u00a355k in London is about enough to rent a place and live ok\u2019ish on your own, and relatively comfortably if you have a partner whom is also earning a salary in a similar bracket.<p>Rent on a 1 bedroom flat in zone 5 is costing \u00a31,500 as a minimum. You then have council tax which is about \u00a3200 a month (soon to be increased). If you travel to the city to go to the office that is gonna cost you at least \u00a350 a week, more if you need to go everyday. Your utilities will cost you at least \u00a3100 a month and food, without takeaways is also going to cost you about \u00a350 a week.<p>All the costs above are lowballing intentionally and do not factor in things like the inevitable lunch coffee and after work drinks, albeit non alcoholic. The reality is that the UK is becoming a much less livable  place and that the cost of living&#x2F;energy&#x2F;whatever comes next is always passed down to the average person.<p>I will not be surprised to see an exodus of skilled workers over the next decade. I personally have set a 5 year target for leaving the country personally, which is sad. My partner has noticed the change herself and is equally as sad that the reality is she will need to leave (after working to acquire citizenship) in order to have a proper chance at buying a home and living a happy life.', 'Outsiders miss the underlying class struggle here.  When an employer underpays a position the door opens to nepotism and class discrimination.  If the pay is below a reasonable wage for the associated costs, ie living in london, only those with outside income will apply.  They take the position for the prestige and power the office conveys rather than the money paid.  So it goes to the son-in-law of someone important, some upstart who needs a fancy stamp on the resume to justify his inevitable next appointment up the civil service hierarchy.  Several New York law firms do this.  Pay new lawyers nothing and you are free to hire only from a narrow group of legal and political families.  Also, every political party filling campaign positions with &quot;volunteers&quot; hoping to get a position of power if the condidate wins office.  They are all sons and daughters from political families.<p>Once upon a time many high positions did not pay.  Some even required regular payment from the office holder.  Want to be near the seat of power in london?  Want the ear of the king?  That will cost <i>you</i>.  Ever watch tales about <i>The Three Musketeers</i>?  In reality, the musketeers were drawn from elite families because they had to cover all of thier own costs.  It was a prestige position for sons of power wanting to work near the palace.', 'I think the job title is misleading, from the job listing:<p>&gt; We are looking for an experienced Head of Cyber Security to lead a team of two cyber analysts<p>&gt; We are a team of around 40, responsible for the Treasury\u2019s technology, security and knowledge and information management services.<p>So it&#x27;s not _the_ Head - but _a_ head, and that &#x27;head&#x27; has a relatively minor  &#x2F; junior manager role.', 'Could it simply be, that these types of jobs (high rank, low pay) are reserved to wealthy people? It might be so that the only ones that can apply are people for which the salary is a mere formality - it&#x27;s just listed because it might be mandatory for the paperwork.

There are multimillion pound &quot;opportunities&quot; to leak information about which bonds will be issued (because that&#x27;ll cause that curve sector temporarily to cheapen up). Paying the paltry sum of 55k for someone who can reasonably be expected to have access to this information, is a signal that they don&#x27;t take seriously the risk of being fleeced for 2 or more orders of magnitude more than that every month.', 'They\u2019ll get someone who wants it on their resume and wants the network so they can move to private sector and sell back to the same department.

People everywhere hunger to understand.</i><p><i>Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot</i>', 'This is a technology demonstrator so it makes sense to start with just a drop but looking at the size of the launch vehicle and the parameters tested here, seems like the progress is coming on slow as the article mentions this was first tested in 2016.<p>I am not very familiar with rockets, so this might be out of ignorance but wouldn&#x27;t the plane like characteristics of this TD make it hard to use for actual launch rockets as they travel quite a bit up and having the winged body might add extra overhead compared to a cylindrical stage.', 'Congratulations , and I am sure this is just a beginning . \\nWhat I find even more interesting is &quot;According to ISRO the configuration of RLV-TD is similar to that of an aircraft and combines the complexity of both launch vehicles and aircraft.&quot;. Are there any challenges in going ahead with aircraft like landing which is so much different from Space-X landing of reusable rockets', 'Congrats ISRO.  There will be naysayers.  Ignore them and keep going.', 'I can also highly recommend reading: Touching Lives: The Little Known Triumphs of the Indian Space Programme, by SK Das (2007).<p>Excerpt: \\nTouching Lives is not merely a chronicle of the community outreach of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is the story of journeys to far corners of India meeting people whose lives have been transformed by technology.<p>More books about ISRO:\\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=33814.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=33814.0</a>', '', 'Unrelated to ISRO&#x27;s honestly solid step in aerospace but to all the commentators on this thread<p>I&#x27;m Desi American and honestly, HN commentators from both India and the US need to stop being little bitches. It&#x27;s made HN go to shit.<p>Boomer American HN commentators - stop being so god damn racist about South Asians.

Y&#x27;all are basically acting like Wumao.<p>Bring on the downvotes. I&#x27;m so sick of all the bullshit on this site', '', 'As an Indian, I&#x27;m proud of what ISRO does. With the constraints given to them, (financial, political, social) it&#x27;s a marvel they&#x27;re still able to deliver results as often as they do.<p>As an Indian taxpayer I&#x27;m frustrated that I effectively cannot control how my money is used.<p>The central government spent $2 B on the Central Vista project, which is a wholly unnecessary construction project for our 550 MPs to feel better about themselves. Incidentally, this is the same as the entire annual budget allocated to ISRO, which benefits hundreds of millions of Indians and no doubt has an effect of all of us.<p>I would much rather they double ISROs budget and let MPs work in the perfectly adequate building they already had.']",
    "summary": "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully conducted the landing experiment of the Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstration (RLV-TD) programme at the Aeronautical Test Range in Chitradurga. ISRO released the RLV, which it had carried to an altitude of 4.5 km by helicopter and released for carrying an autonomous landing on a runway. With the goal of achieving low-cost access to space, one of the key objectives of mastering the RLV technology,\u00a0India looks to\u00a0become the first country to launch a reusable two-stage orbital launch vehicle.",

    "content": "A new study suggests that compostable fast-food containers designed to be more eco-friendly than plastic ones may release toxic chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into the air. The study analyzed samples including molded fiber bowls, popcorn bags, and burger wrappers for total fluorine content and up to 14 PFAS levels. Polymers with fluorinated side chains used to make the paper-based food packaging may break down over time into volatile fluorotelomer alcohols and fluorotelomer methacrylates. Total PFAS levels surprisingly drop by up to 85% after two years of storing the products due to volatilization of fluorotelomer alcohols and other PFAS. Researchers suggest regulators ban all PFAS, including polymeric PFAS, in food packaging.Compostable packaging may not be as environmentally friendly as marketed, leading to methane emissions when it ends up in a landfill. PFAS chemicals like those found in non-stick pans and food packaging have also been found in compostable packaging and dental floss, raising questions about their safety. However, some manufacturers are phasing out PFAS in compostable bowls, replacing them with plant-based coatings. Reusable packaging remains the best solution for going green. Food packaging toxicity is receiving increasing attention in the news, with recent reports of BPA-like chemicals seeping from labels to food. Using biodegradable packaging like paper and glass may be a safer and simpler alternative.",

and documentations.\n\nValeria Mongelli/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRome\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n      Italians who use English and other foreign words in official communications could face fines of up to \u20ac100,000 ($108,705) under new legislation introduced by  Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party. \n  \n\n      Fabio Rampelli, a member of the lower chamber of deputies, introduced the legislation, which is supported by the prime minister. \n  \n\n      While the legislation encompasses all foreign languages, it is particularly geared at \u201cAnglomania\u201d or use of English words, which the draft states \u201cdemeans and mortifies\u201d the Italian language, adding that it is even worse because the UK is no longer part of the EU. \n  \n\n      The bill, which has yet to go up for parliamentary debate, requires anyone who holds an office in public administration to have \u201cwritten and oral knowledge and mastery of the Italian language.\u201d It also prohibits use of English in official documentation, including \u201cacronyms and names\u201d of job roles in companies operating in the country.\n  \n\n      Foreign entities would have to have Italian language editions of all internal regulations and employment contracts, according to a draft of the legislation seen by CNN. \n  \n\n      \u201cIt is not just a matter of fashion, as fashions pass, but Anglomania has repercussions for society as a whole,\u201d the draft bill states. \n  \n\n      The first article of the legislation guarantees that even in offices that deal with non Italian-speaking foreigners, Italian must be the primary language used.\n  \n\n      Article 2 would make Italian \u201cmandatory for the promotion and use of public goods and services in the national territory.\u201d Not doing so could garner fines between \u20ac5,000 ($5,435) and \u20ac100,000 ($108,705).\n  \n\n    Don\u2019t say \u201cbru-shetta\u201d instead of \u201cbru-sketta\u201d\n\n\n      Under the proposed law, the Culture Ministry would establish a committee whose remit would include \u201ccorrect use of the Italian language and its pronunciation\u201d in schools, media, commerce and advertising. \n  \n\n      This would mean that saying \u201cbru-shetta\u201d instead of \u201cbru-sketta\u201d could be a punishable offense.\n

bid by the government to protect the country\u2019s cuisine. \n  \n\n      It has introduced legislation to ban so-called synthetic or cell-based cuisine due to the lack of scientific studies on the effects of synthetic food, as well as \u201cto safeguard our nation\u2019s heritage and our agriculture based on the Mediterranean diet,\u201d Meloni\u2019s Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said in a press conference.\n  \n\n      Last week, Italy\u2019s ministers of Culture and Agriculture officially entered Italian cuisine into candidacy for UNESCO World Heritage Site status, which will be decided in December 2025.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd

    "content": "A new study reveals that Canada has experienced a rise in remote work, which shows no signs of slowing down, despite pressure from employers to return to the office. The preference for working from home remains extremely popular, with several companies pivoting to a work-from-home model. While there are conversion issues around land use and zoning, this work model has provided certain benefits to those who can do it, but there are potential issues for those who work in industries where working remotely is not feasible. The pandemic has created a new class in society, breaking the link between where you live and where you work. Governments and businesses should accept the shift to remote work as the new norm.The National Post article discusses how work-from-home (WFH) has become the norm for many white-collar workers in Canada since the pandemic. Comments highlight how WFH poses challenges such as the disproportionate impact on lower-income workers, loss of revenue for public transit, and housing affordability. Others note the benefits of WFH in terms of flexibility, avoiding commutes, being closer to family, and finding cheaper housing outside big cities. The article's argument that productivity and innovation suffer due to WFH is challenged by some commenters. Additionally, the prevalence of contractors and socialized medicine in Canada and Europe may contribute to the popularity of WFH.",

Software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains \"sandboxed\" and runs separately from the host machine.\nA sandbox is temporary. When it's closed, all the software and files and the state are deleted. You get a brand-new instance of the sandbox every time you open the application. Note, however, that as of Windows 11 Build 22509, your data will persist through a restart initiated from inside the virtualized environment\u00e2\u0080\u0094useful for installing applications that require the OS to reboot.\nSoftware and applications installed on the host aren't directly available in the sandbox. If you need specific applications available inside the Windows Sandbox environment, they must be explicitly installed within the environment.\nWindows Sandbox has the following properties:\n\nPart of Windows: Everything required for this feature is included in Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise. There's no need to download a VHD.\nPristine: Every time Windows Sandbox runs, it's as clean as a brand-new installation of Windows.\nDisposable: Nothing persists on the device. Everything is discarded when the user closes the application.\nSecure: Uses hardware-based virtualization for kernel isolation. It relies on the Microsoft hypervisor to run a separate kernel that isolates Windows Sandbox from the host.\nEfficient: Uses the integrated kernel scheduler, smart memory management, and virtual GPU.\n\n\nImportant\nWindows Sandbox enables network connection by default. It can be disabled using the Windows Sandbox configuration file.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nWindows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education build 18305 or Windows 11 (Windows Sandbox is currently not supported on Windows Home edition)\nAMD64 or (as of Windows 11 Build 22483) ARM64 architecture\nVirtualization capabilities enabled in BIOS\nAt least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)\nAt least 1 GB of free disk space (SSD recommended)\nAt least two CPU cores (four cores with hyperthreading recommended)\n\nInstallation\n\nEnsure that your machine is using Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, build version 18305 or Windows 11.\n\nEnable virtualization on the machine.\n\nIf you're using a physical machine, make sure virtualization capabilities are enabled in the BIOS.\n\nIf you're using a virtual machine, run the following PowerShell command to enable nested virtualization:\nSet-VMProcessor -VMName <VMName> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true\n\n\n\n\nUse the search bar on the task bar and type Turn Windows Features on or off to access the Windows Optional Features tool. Select Windows Sandbox and then OK. Restart the computer if you're prompted.\nIf the Windows Sandbox option is unavailable, your computer doesn't meet the requirements to run Windows Sandbox. If you think this analysis is incorrect, review the prerequisite list and steps 1 and 2.\n\nNote\nTo enable Sandbox using PowerShell, open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command:\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName \"Containers-DisposableClientVM\" -All -Online\n\n\n\nLocate and select Windows Sandbox on the Start menu to run it for the first time.\n\nNote\nWindows Sandbox does not adhere to the mouse settings of the host system, so if the host system is set to use a right-handed mouse, you should apply these settings in Windows Sandbox manually.\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nCopy an executable file (and any other files needed to run the application) from the host and paste them into the Windows Sandbox window.\n\nRun the executable file or installer inside the sandbox.\n\nWhen you're finished experimenting, close the sandbox. A dialog box will state that all sandbox content will be discarded and permanently deleted. Select Ok.\n\nConfirm that your host machine doesn't exhibit any of the modifications that you made in Windows Sandbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nSubmit and view feedback for\n\n\nThis product\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView all page feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nLight\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDark\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nHigh contrast\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Versions\nBlog\nContribute\nPrivacy\nTerms of Use\nTrademarks\n\u00a9 Microsoft 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\n\n\n\nIn this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nLight\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDark\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nHigh contrast\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Versions\nBlog\nContribute\nPrivacy\nTerms of Use\nTrademarks\n\u00a9 Microsoft 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n['Would be cool if video games could be run inside containers or sandboxes where they ship with the dependencies they need.<p>Don&#x27;t know how many times Steam has reinstalled my C++ library or whatever else it does when it prepares a game for launch.<p>Not to mention games have unrestricted access to my filesystem, which isn&#x27;t ideal', 'One of my favorite uses for this is creating .wsb files that would launch a script and install zoom&#x2F;WebEx&#x2F;etc so I would not have to install them on my PC.

He also reflects on his own life and career, including his obsession with his patients and the importance of self-criticism and doubt in the medical profession. Marsh also discusses his work teaching doctors in Ukraine and the importance of empathy in healthcare. Marsh emphasizes the need to treat poor people better and improve the first years of life, and the importance of learning from mistakes in order to grow.According to neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, it is essential to give some independence to healthcare providers in order to be decisive in treating patients; autonomous doctors and nurses are crucial in the battle against disease. Marsh emphasizes that today there is a need for a balance between patient freedom and the medical organization to find ways to cure, especially due to high technology costs. Discussing false positives and over-diagnosis, he believes that private healthcare can overestimate the risk of not operating and underestimate the risk of operating. Marsh has started an organization to support palliative care in Ukraine and is currently writing a fairy tale for his granddaughters; he stresses the importance of living in the present.A father discussed death with his inconsolable son who was sad about his grandfather's death from COVID-19. They talked for an hour about confronting death little by little throughout life like a vaccine that helps handle the pain of losing our loved ones and eventual death. Seneca's quote about living enough emphasizes the importance of addressing end-of-life care. However, one commenter disagrees, stating that they know someone who is almost 100 and still has good health and mental acuity, suggesting that age can vary.",

Software prefetching of address(es) to be loaded and SIMD instructions for processing multiple values at once can significantly accelerate batches of hash table lookups. Overall, Robin Hood probing with backshift deletion is recommended as the default choice for hash tables.SIMD-accelerated lookups for hash tables can significantly improve performance, especially for two-way chaining, using AVX2 256-bit SIMD operations. The overhead of setting up an SIMD comparison is not worth it for linear probing tables. The Robin Hood probing greatly decreases the maximum probe length, making query performance more consistent. A fixed-size chaining hash table can be an efficient solution for fast hash tables. Google claims that absl::flat_map saves a lot of memory because it still works fairly well at 90%-95% occupancy.

(Bob Gathany/[email\u00a0protected] HVT/TNS)  March 07, 2023   Christopher Kirkman       A Pentagon study revealed that 77 percent of young Americans do not qualify for military service without a waiver due to being overweight, drug use, or mental or physical problems. \u201cWhen considering youth disqualified for one reason alone, the most prevalent disqualification rates are overweight (11 percent), drug and alcohol abuse (8 percent), and medical/physical health (7 percent),\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s 2020 Qualified Military Available Study of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 read.\u00a0  Several key findings were noted in the summary of the report. For example, most ineligible youth (44 percent) are disqualified for multiple reasons rather than in only one area. Among those ineligible for only one reason, being overweight was the highest disqualification, at 11 percent. Drug use (8 percent), medical/physical only (7 percent) and mental health only (4 percent) were the other leading categories found in the study.   The largest increases in disqualification estimates observed between 2013 and 2020 were for mental health and overweight conditions. Another key finding was that the proportion of youth both eligible and not currently enrolled in college was only 12 percent.  READ MORE: Ret.

Maj. Charlie Dietz, a Department of Defense spokesman, stated that the study confirmed the challenges of recruiting new military members.  \u201cThere are many factors that we are navigating through, such as the fact that youth are more disconnected and disinterested compared to previous generations,\u201d Dietz said, according to Military.com. \u201cThe declining veteran population and shrinking military footprint has contributed to a market that is unfamiliar with military service resulting in an overreliance of military stereotypes.\u201d In September, Pentagon leaders sounded the alarm on its recruiting challenges. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Department anticipates we will collectively miss our recruiting mission despite accessing more than 170,000 remarkable young men and women\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Stephanie Miller, deputy assistant secretary of defense for military personnel policy, told the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis constitutes an unprecedented mission gap and is reason for concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among the concerns expressed by lawmakers is the COVID-19 vaccine mandate that was only recently ended for the U.S. military. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R) pushed for the end of the mandate in her support of December\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur country must never fall behind in providing for a strong national defense, which is why I am proud to bring an end to the Biden Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authoritarian COVID vaccine mandate on our servicemen and women that has weakened our military recruitment and impaired our military ranks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a statement.

Basically any diagnosis of a mental health condition, like ADHD, will block military service.  This is true even if symptoms are well managed without medication.  The rise of diagnosis of these conditions combined with digital records means a lot of people are prohibited to join due to mental health that would have been overlooked in previous decades.<p>3. This serves as the official excuse for why recruitment numbers are down. IMO recruitment numbers are down because Iraq&#x2F;Afghanistan was such a shitshow.', 'It would be interesting to see how many of the remaining 23% are in the slice of society where a military career makes financial sense.  When I joined the Army I was going from having been fired from McD&#x27;s last month to making $1K a month with food and shelter taken care of.  That made sense at the time.  My kid is plenty skinny, mentally stable, and drug free, but he&#x27;s also a successful college student and budding entrepreneur, so he&#x27;s not going to be wearing a uniform unless we go full WW3 conscription.', 'Joining the military means giving up most of your civilian rights laid out in the Bill of Rights, in exchange for pay and training.  Historically, this has often been a pretty good deal for those without other economic options.<p>However, if you think the country&#x27;s leaders are going to send you off to get killed in poorly thought-out and reckless adventures for dubious reasons, then giving up those rights starts looking less and less attractive.  Given that&#x27;s what happened in Afghanistan (which was somewhat justifiable, but could have been a six-month operation, rather than a 20-year one) and Iraq (completely unjustifiable, an epic disaster), it&#x27;s not surprising that economic desperation is now the main motivator for military recruiting, nor is it surprising that applicants coming from that background aren&#x27;t in the best mental or physical health.<p>Step one in regaining trust would involve purging the government and military leadership of the architects of the debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan, although that seems unlikely at present - these are the same neocon ideologues who are vigorously opposing a negotiated settlement in eastern Ukraine while also pushing for military confrontation with China.', 'Not a big difference, but I note that this is without a waiver. There is a process for getting a waiver for each branch[1]. There aren&#x27;t a ton of waivers issued - only between 50,000 and 80,000 [2]. But the DoD is reviewing what can be removed as disqualifying (at least 38 disqualifying conditions) and multiple reports have been issued signaling out ADHD and marijuana as potential criteria to eliminate[3].<p>Personally I think it should come down to the role and risk. There&#x27;s plenty of jobs where you&#x27;re not seeing combat or dealing with inherently risky or critical tasks, and thus shouldn&#x27;t be held to the same standard as those doing critical tasks. Just as one obvious example, somebody with a desk job doesn&#x27;t need legs.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.operationmilitarykids.org&#x2F;military-medical-waiver-guide&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.operationmilitarykids.org&#x2F;military-medical-waive...</a> [2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serialpodcast.org&#x2F;maps&#x2F;number-of-waivers-given-to-us-army-recruits\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serialpodcast.org&#x2F;maps&#x2F;number-of-waivers-given-to-us...</a> [3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rand-review&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;army-enlistment-waivers-in-the-age-of-legal-marijuana.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rand-review&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;army-enlistmen...</a>', 'If someone is overweight, but otherwise healthy (which I suspect is the case for a lot of young people, as they haven&#x27;t been overweight long enough for it to take a big toll on the body) can they not go ahead and enrol them and then whip them into shape during training? If they are really aren&#x27;t able to meet their recruiting targets it seems like a missed opportunity.', 'Maybe military service could help some of these folks out of their unfortunate situation, given a longer training period and proper support.', 'If there\u2019s a proper war e.g an existential one like Ukraine is experiencing, all this goes out the window and it\u2019s any man aged 16-65 that can stand and hold a gun.', 'Standards to join the US Military are flexible. When I enlisted, my recruiter explained that I could get a waiver for just about anything short of murder. I did get a couple waivers. How willing they are to give waivers depends completely on their recruitment goals.', 'There&#x27;s a qualification of <i>some</i> importance missing here:<p>77% of young Americans <i>who applied</i> ... were rejected for various reasons.<p>ie: <i>Most</i> young people who want to join the forces don&#x27;t meet the minimum standards.<p>Perhaps the vast bulk of people that do meet those standards see no future for themselves in the US forces and don&#x27;t apply.<p>And there&#x27;s no easily teased out figure on the health of young Americans in general here w&#x2F;out additional info about application rates and demographics.', 'I wonder how much of this is due to outdated assessment criteria. If drone and remote control is the future of warfare there may not be too much need to do 20 push-ups on demand - the fat kid staring into the computer screen could quite feasibly the warrior of the next war.']",

After Twitter made the code for its algorithm open source at noon Pacific Time on March 31, users began to pick through it, and discovered that tweets judged to be about Ukraine were down-ranked \u2013 meaning users were less likely to see them in their feed.

Video of day    https://twitter.com/aakashg0/status/1641976925064245249?s=20Anecdotally, Twitter users who post frequently on Ukraine topics had noticed less engagement with their accounts since Musk took over the platform in October last year. Musk\u2019s own position on support for Ukraine is ambiguous.While Musk has aided Ukraine by providing it with Starlink satellite Internet terminals, which the country has used to keep communications up and running for both military and civilians during Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, some of his other public positions regarding the war have come in for criticism \u2013 even from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

It&#x27;s particularly awkward since the Ukrainian side seems to have a more effective disinformation program (eg. NAFO, Snake Island, the Ghost of Kiev, etc).

They&#x27;re instead programming your hardware to do their gaslighting&#x2F;censorship&#x2F;filtering for them.<p>Dumb pipe for them, but you&#x27;re left burning cycles on your phone&#x2F;client&#x2F;whatever to hide their material for them. Corollary being that with a sufficiently misbehaving client, one ought to be able to reconstitute an unfiltered stream to get a more accurate representation of the awfulness of those around you instead of only seeing what Twitter wants you to see.<p>It also means that server-side, there may actually be nothing preventing using a sufficiently misbehaving client from repurposing the Twitter backend as a Command &amp; Control layer. In fact, one may even be able to compose several account provisioning&#x2F;deprovisioning&#x2F;visibility primitives to ensure no normal client would see anything, while the message nevertheless gets through. It&#x27;s technically auditable, but if I put on my blacker hat; I miiiiight see a few ways to get up to some difficult to follow mischief if the system as posted is truly representative of what is there. May do dome net traffic analysis to see if I can figure out where the request is that would return the hypothetical ruleset to be consumed by the client. Not entirely convinced the engine is entirely client side, as that would have tipped their hand much longer ago I&#x27;d think. Not sure til I actually audit the full codebasr.<p>Yet another reason I&#x27;ve never quite been brave enough to pull the trigger on hosting a system like this for anyone but those I personally know and trust. After a certain point, probability goes to 1 that somepne is going to find a way to repurpose something nice no matter the level of good intention into something horrible. I like to think of it as a more abstract form of Rule34. If you build an information transfer system, someone will use it for something illegal somewhere.<p>Of course, even if I&#x27;m totally wrong, odds are that if I&#x27;m seeing the potential here, there is a smarter, less ethical version of me with a goatee that&#x27;s already picked it apart and os likely actively exploiting it.']",
    "summary": "Twitter algorithm code analysis reveals that tweets related to Ukraine were down-ranked after Elon Musk took over the platform, as discovered by users who inspected the recently open-sourced code. Musk's stance on Ukraine has been ambiguous, despite providing Starlink internet terminals to the country. The move towards transparency with the open-sourcing of the algorithm code has been welcomed by many users, but concerns were raised about the potential for gaming the algorithm or the possibility of botnets exploiting it. The down-ranking of Ukraine-related tweets by the algorithm has affected users who frequently post about Ukraine topics. There is speculation on whether the down-ranking is due to malice, incompetence, or low engagement levels. The Twitter code is for Twitter Spaces, rather than home timeline ranking, and a significant criticism is the ability to manipulate visibility for users by remotely throttling engagement to filter or censor content on the user's end.",
