    "originBody": "March 2024 (This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think they should tell students something about startups. This is what I think they should tell them.) Most of you probably think that when you're released into the so-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of job. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you can use to avoid ever having to get a job. The trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for avoiding work, because if you start your own company you'll work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including a boss telling you what to do. It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's. And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard way to get really rich. If you look at the lists of the richest people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of them did it by starting their own companies. Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber shop to starting Google. I'm here to talk about one extreme end of that continuum. I'm going to tell you how to start Google. The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups when they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000 startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup, because we've helped people do it for the last 19 years. You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell you how to start Google. You might be thinking \"How could we start Google?\" But that's effectively what the people who did start Google were thinking before they started it. If you'd told Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they were about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars, their heads would have exploded. All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it seems worth pursuing. You can't know whether it will turn into a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I say I'm going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I'm going to tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google. [1] How do you get from where you are now to the point where you can start a successful startup? You need three things. You need to be good at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you're going to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with. How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much harder on something you're interested in than something you're doing because you think you're supposed to. If you're not sure what technology to get good at, get good at programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next 10. Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing. If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're writing a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you don't know how. You're going to figure out how a lot faster than you'd learn anything in a class. You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them? That's the cutoff. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design. Don't feel like your projects have to be serious. They can be as frivolous as you like, so long as you're building things you're excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build the kind of things they and their friends want. And that's exactly what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one day. You don't have to do just one project. In fact it's good to learn about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn't just learn calligraphy. He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable. Whatever you're interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?) So that's the first of the three things you need, to get good at some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the time you start the company you'll have spent at least 7 years practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything after practicing it for 7 years. Let's suppose you're 22 and you've succeeded: You're now really good at some technology. How do you get startup ideas? It might seem like that's the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer, how do you get the idea to start Google? Actually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology. Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and each one of these is a potential startup. In the town near our house there's a shop with a sign warning that the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put up a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at this situation would think \"why don't you just plane off the part that sticks?\" Once you're good at programming, all the missing software in the world starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter. I'll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century, American universities used to publish printed directories with all the students' names and contact info. When I tell you what these directories were called, you'll know which startup I'm talking about. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture of each student next to their name. So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2003, and the university still hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has an online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university. The university administration has been diligently having meetings about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another decade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this situation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a program to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\" So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of users. Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project. There's that word again. Projects aren't just the best way to learn about technology. They're also the best source of startup ideas. Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also began as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company when Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this computer to other people.\" That's how Apple started. They weren't even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine how lame this company seemed? Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave you every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\" Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like Mark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this is stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let's figure out which those are and show them first.\" It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of projects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to start a company. You're just following your instincts about what's interesting. And if you're young and good at technology, then your unconscious instincts about what's interesting are better than your conscious ideas about what would be a good company. So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use — something your friends aren't just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down — then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way. What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once you're good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere. [2] Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders. The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going to say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is someone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and the only way to judge this is to work with them on things. At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them. The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the largest numbers of successful startups come from, it's pretty much the same as the list of the most selective universities. I don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's because the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage to get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart and determined people. [3] You don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university. The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders. So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university, because that's where the cofounders and the ideas are. That's it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school. Notes [1] The rhetorical trick in this sentence is that the \"Google\"s refer to different things. What I mean is: a company that has as much chance of growing as big as Google ultimately did as Larry and Sergey could have reasonably expected Google itself would at the time they started it. But I think the original version is zippier. [2] Making something for your friends isn't the only source of startup ideas. It's just the best source for young founders, who have the least knowledge of what other people want, and whose own wants are most predictive of future demand anyway. [3] Strangely enough this is particularly true in countries like the US where undergraduate admissions are done badly. US admissions departments make applicants jump through a lot of arbitrary hoops that have little to do with their intellectual ability. But the more arbitrary a test, the more it becomes a test of mere determination and resourcefulness. And those are the two most important qualities in startup founders. So US admissions departments are better at selecting founders than they would be if they were better at selecting students.

Trying to guess the next big thing is not a winning strategy. More so for teenagers who lack a lot of skills including good judgement. Even if their guess was guaranteed spot-on, and the universe was rooting for you, once the cat is out of the bag, what advantage would a 15 years old have? They don't have any war chest or connections to survive. If the goal is to optimize the individual's outcome, outside working towards a stable 9-5 career, their best bet is indeed building projects they're passionate about and utilizing the skills they gain in their next endeavour. One way to waste your life is being constantly distracted by which industry is more profitable or has more potential, doubting yourself and switching context. reply solatic 3 hours agoparentprevDepends on how you measure individual outcomes. Arguably, a life lived passionately is the best individual outcome, even if it doesn't result in you becoming rich. Maybe that's a privileged thing to say, and certainly if someone following their passions is staring down the barrel of poverty then they might want to rebalance in favor of their financial health, but in the absence of dire financial circumstances, passion is a good compass to follow. Certainly many people volunteer their time for causes they are passionate about, with no expectation of financial reward, and are happier for doing so. What PG is noting is that sometimes (even if rarely), what an individual is passionate about can also be good for investors. But the passion comes first. reply klabb3 4 hours agoparentprevI think he’s saying that at the time when you’re making the prediction you can’t know. If you're gonna learn som core technology that you can use 7 years later (where he suggests programming) then this makes sense. I think there’s a strong element of luck here: even if you have general purpose skills in eg programming or CS, once a novel opportunity presents itself, you likely won’t have a head start, especially today. But what can you do about it? Telling kids who are 14-15 that they should bet on some more niched tech like LLMs or even transformers would likely be terrible advice. reply bryanrasmussen 4 hours agoparentprevI upvoted because I thought it was a clever observation (meaning one that did not obviously present itself to me), although I did need https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39763016 to explain what you meant. reply sudhirj 2 hours agoparentprevBecoming among the best in the world at one or an intersection of things is an excellent individual outcome, and one way to do that is to work hard on what interests you. You can certainly become the best in the world at some combination of things that don’t interest you, but that seems less fun. reply imadj 5 hours agoparentprev> This optimizes for Paul's outcomes not for the individual outcomes. I don't get your comment. Are you saying PG is trying to deter and throw off teenagers so they don't compete in the space he invested in? reply killerdhmo 4 hours agorootparentNo, they're saying 1000 bets on random foundational technology means PG is more likely to have a startup to invest in that's a winner, then necessarily giving good advice to the individual founder who doesn't have 1000 turns at the wheel. reply resonious 3 hours agorootparentThis does make sense. I think it's also possible that most of the successes PG sees are people doing something interesting to them. So the argument would be more like: among success stories, true interest is more common than trend chasing. Of course YC funds tons of ChatGPT wrappers so dunno. reply muzani 2 hours agorootparentprevThe founder who tries to do something boring and profitable ends up doing things like making another CRM or some kind of SaaS pipeline from one thing to another. These tend to be things that get built anyway by the people with more funding. There's so many CRMs built on top of vtiger open source, and these may be better than vtiger for a while, but in the long run they fall behind. Paradoxically, avoiding risks makes people more likely to take the riskier options. reply satvikpendem 53 minutes agorootparentAnd yet, what makes most people on average the most amount of money is working on boring problems, not sexy, new technology problems. That is what is mainly implied by the top level parent. For every Elon making rockets, many more are more likely to make a significant amount of money just building another CRM. reply jamwil 4 hours agorootparentprevNo. Survivorship Bias. reply nickpp 1 hour agoparentprevI wonder: what better advice, that optimizes for individual outcomes, would you offer founders-to-be instead? reply android521 4 hours agoparentprevit seems like PG doesn't worry about AI replacing programmers reply walteweiss 4 hours agorootparentHe’s hiring them, so if there’s no programmers, but a program— well, okay reply codethatwerks 11 hours agoprevWhat is the parallel advice for a 40 year old? I guess the programming and tinkering stuff still applies. But university cannot be redone. Sure I can study but I wont have any connection to most young people. I’ll be the old guy. And this assumes I can afford the loss of income. I assume a lot of start ups are started by older people too. I think for older people an advantage is to solve older people problems. Like how sucky accessing all kinds of “adulting” things are from aged care to dealing with myriad systems with kids schools or any other problems that have inevitably been chucked at you. Some of these “startups” might actually be lobbying/political work for the good that doesn’t make money, some might be startups. Also being older I don’t care about making a unicorn. I see that as an odd goal for a founder of any age but a great goal for an investor. reply prisenco 10 hours agoparentLess startup, more starting a business. The older I get the less I want to build a startup and more I want to start a business. Something that takes a little bit of capital, lots of hard work, gets some customers and provides goods or services, without venture capital firms and 100x returns and everything that comes with that, just a standard business. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI1SLHEC98I reply bruce511 6 hours agorootparentAs you get older it becomes harder to start a business, simply because of financial concerns. As a just-graduated poor student I was used to living on practically nothing. By 40 I had a mortgage, kids, wife etc. The penalty-for-failure at that age is substantial. When I stopped getting a salary in my 20s my wife was earning so we just lived on her salary. That lasted a few years until the new business found its niche. So, how to start a business later in life? Slowly and carefully. First do it as a side hustle. Night's and weekends. (Which is good to see if you still gave the energy for that.) Price things \"as if its full time\". If you're selling ceramics on Saturdays figure out what your daily sales need to be and price accordingly. If you're teaching piano ditto. Side hustles also let you experiment with marketing. See if the market will bear more than just a Saturday here or there. When you can, take a paid vacation from your day job, and see how busy you are (and what income) from the eide hustle. Figure out if you enjoyed that more than the day job. Save every penny from the dide hustle. You'll want at least 6 months of cash before you make the leap. 3 months to get income back up, 3 to look for a new job if it fails. It's harder to start a new thing in your 40s. But it's also more likely to succeed, IF you plan and execute right. reply GeneralMayhem 3 hours agorootparentThis is true if you require the same amount of income to maintain your lifestyle, but if you've been working in tech for 20 years, you have savings. I'm not in my 40s yet, but it's much more viable for me to take a risk now than it was when I was just starting out because I can afford to fail for a couple years without, you know, becoming homeless. reply epolanski 2 hours agorootparentThis so much. I'm 36 and I can afford to not work for many years with my savings. It's definitely easier now for me. reply satvikpendem 49 minutes agorootparentUsing savings when younger can significantly increase your overall retirement age. There, however, is also a risk of not starting a company in time (or having enough time to complete and perhaps exit a business) by waiting until you are fully retired. How one wants to slice that risk to reward ratio is up to them. My option is the higher parent's one, starting side hustles until slowly they take over my main income, such that I feel no loss of quality of life and I'd still retire when I want to. It is akin to rolling green-blue deployments rather than shut-down-the-server deployments. reply ed_mercer 2 hours agorootparentprevWhile I also consider myself lucky, not everyone works as a software engineer earning high salaries. Being older also (usually) means more responsibilities and less tolerance for risk. reply epolanski 58 minutes agorootparentVery true, I think that while my savings are very good, I would have much less risk tolerance if I had kids. reply ehnto 5 hours agorootparentprevYou have a much better idea of what demand is tangible and grounded, which means you are in a great position to start a bootstrapped small business. Some people have been calling them boring businesses which is actually pretty exciting to me, since they are tangible machines you can put work into. All my attempts at starting a SaaS when I was younger were basically me building a cool thing and then yelling into the wind. I am looking for a more concrete market for my next venture, and it doesn't have to be cool or cutting edge. reply Solvency 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's a romantic idea until you realize you're now dealing and subservient to the dredges of society, the worst kinds of customers, the worst kind of people. Far worse than a niche market specialized technology sales prospect. Get ready to have a new contempt for humanity. Get ready to be raked over the coals by Yelp. reply boringg 7 hours agorootparentMan you gotta get outside more often. Most of the world doesn't work in tech and has for thousands of years and surprise doesn't suffer from a new level of contempt for their fellow human. reply gnicholas 6 hours agorootparentprevGP didn’t actually mention what kind of business (B2B or B2C, tech or another sector) — the description was broad enough to encompass my IP licensing business, which is about as tech-focused as it gets. reply sandspar 7 hours agorootparentprevLol hell yeah brother my local coffee shop regulars are well known for being the dredges of society. reply codethatwerks 1 hour agorootparentCoffee shop? Customers fine, but health inspectors and rent increases are your antihero. As well as too much competition. reply throwoutway 7 hours agoparentprevGive yourself a break. When I studied in uni I was stuck at tables with 'old guys' and 'old ladies' and I had a lot of respect for them. They paid attention, wanted to learn, were there to learn. When I didn't understand something, I asked them before I asked the teacher and they generally were happy to help. I have fond memories reply tomhoward 7 hours agoparentprevThere's a study that often gets shared around, purportedly \"Debunking the Myth of the Young Entrepreneur\", showing data that most successful startup founders start their companies in their mid-to-late 40s, including tech/social media companies. It depends a lot on how you qualify and categorise founders, companies and \"successful\", but of course you can understand why it can be somewhat truthful: people in their 40s have had 2-3 decades to build up experience, networks and a track record, making it much easier to build a team and attract investors and initial customers. I'm sure almost all of these founders in their 40s have had at least some partial success in their past. So it still affirms that it's best to start as young as possible, allowing time to experiment with ideas, markets, co-founders, etc. I've seen plenty of founders bounce from one-to-another-to-another startup from their 20s to their 40s, each one being vastly more successful than the last. But as you point out there are still all kinds of opportunities to build new products to address needs that are overlooked by younger founders, so you should absolutely go for it if you're inspired. I feel the same as you about being less interested in \"unicorn\"-scale success after 40; as you mature, have kids, experience illness in your family and become more observant of problems in different segments of society, you become much more focused on just providing well for your family and doing some good for the world than having to be some kind of all-conquering hero.

Looking at the state of open source software today a google is simply impossible because the ecosystem has rotted from the inside. Look at how much effort it took to write the cgi-bin scripts google started with vs whatever flavour of the week JS framework you have to use now. Not sure what the solution is but we need fewer sheep in development and less permissive licenses so developers doing unglamorous work can capture more of the value. There's a reason why every shop which supports massive open source projects is running away from legacy licenses as fast as they can and that reason is Amazon. If you don't care about developers from the user side of things it's just as bad. The GPL in the age of cloud services does as much to protect user freedom as the MIT license did in the 1990s. reply ramraj07 7 hours agorootparentCreating something from scratch is so much easier today than it ever was, and I’ve been creating crap for decades now. All the fancy JavaScript crap is purely optional. You can still write something in CGI if you want. My last prototype I wrote with Vue and JQuery and as pure html and .js files. It was an absolute blast! And the users loved it! Have you tested streamlit? FastAPI? Everything is so easy now. reply xisthesqrtof9 7 hours agorootparentI agree. I think the parent poster was referring to how much noise there is, and I'd agree. The moment you start learning, just the fanciest stuff is shoved down your throat. So you just assume its the best and roll with it. I find myself tinkering more with PHP now that I've been using js for the past 7 years. reply llm_trw 7 hours agorootparentprevToday if I were to write a cgi script it would have to send json payloads to the JS front end because round trip latency on phones is between 100 to 500ms to hit a dns server. I was getting lower latency on dialup in 1996. On my desktop it's 2ms on a bad day. You can't just use HTML because browsers have mutated to fat clients for a X like protocol which is a mishmash of html, css, js, and whatever else someone's decided to throw on top of it. We're using screwdrivers as axes and everyone is acting like this is some type of acceptable outcome. reply nicoburns 6 hours agorootparentYou absolutely can just use HTML. You're writing this on HN that just uses HTML and is one of the more responsive websites on mobile connections. You can't make as rich an interavtive experience as you can with JS, but you never could. reply llm_trw 5 hours agorootparentJust because a site is responsive doesn't mean it's HTML. The fact that a lot of people assume that you can't have a responsive site with JS is all the indictment of $current_year front end development you need. These are some of the JS functions HN runs in the background, on top of the CSS: function $ (id) { return document.getElementById(id); } function byClass (el, cl) { return el ? el.getElementsByClassName(cl) : [] } function byTag (el, tg) { return el ? el.getElementsByTagName(tg) : [] } function allof (cl) { return byClass(document, cl) } ... reply nicoburns 25 minutes agorootparentI didn't say you can't have a responsive site with JavaScript, I said that you can have one with plain HTML. HN may use JS for a few things (upvotes?), but it's mostly full page reloads including for loading threads and posting comments. reply satvikpendem 46 minutes agorootparentprevBut, no one is forcing you to use the latest JS framework, you can still write cgi-bin scripts if you wanted... There is no need to follow the trend du jour, it is some fallacy that you're describing that somehow it's easier then than today when the technology is largely backwards compatible. reply throwaway2562 50 minutes agorootparentprev> Not sure what the solution is but we need fewer sheep in development and less permissive licenses so developers doing unglamorous work can capture more of the value.

The Oxide route is one of the better approaches for backend. \"Apple\" of enterprise OSS, but I think their ambitions are too small. Prefab containers full of seamless and modular amounts of each food groups: CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, HDD, interconnect, and uplink all in and managed.

I would suggest using your network and consider a path of least resistance such as building a side-business while working that either solves niche enterprise problems or makes enterprise capabilities more manageable for small businesses. Starting a business is really easy. The bullshit that every business needs to do isn't particularly magical or mysterious. Don't get too invested in the bureaucratization process, but also be sure to implement what needs to happen just in time. Find cofounders from your friends and coworkers, and go to startup events. Find people who you respect and who respect you, have integrity, and are the most fun. It's important to find people who don't turn into arrogant SOBs or raging sociopaths when large sums of money become involved. Honesty, awareness, navigating/prioritizing ambiguity, and conflict resolution skills are damn important. Avoid external funding if at all possible unless it unblocks time-to-market that would otherwise miss market time or grow too slowly to survive. (Growing slower is often easier and more sustainable!)

It's pretty clear he is using it as a common point of reference for 14 and 15 year olds. \"You guys know about Google?, the giant company with the web site? Okay well let me tell you how companies like that are built.\" Building a successful company depends on many things. The point made here is that you are unlikely to be expert enough, and motivated enough to build a successful business in an area you are not interested in, and haven't played around in. So to increase the amount of domains that you could create a business in from 0 to a small positive integer you should build things that interest you. Of course if you have money, or know how to persuade people who have money, you can be something of an idiot and still develop a successful business. Usually you are not really developing the business in this case, more attaching yourself to a business that smart people are running for you. In a pool of high school freshmen, most probably have a better chance of success following the first path, than the second. reply cmrdporcupine 16 hours agoparentprevThis is what is fundamentally missing from most talk about \"tech\" startups by VC types these days. They're not actually interested in the nerdy stuff, just in the \"disruption\" stuff. L&S were, and they hired other people who were. They didn't start with a business idea, but with a technical one. They filled in the blanks on the business side after they survived the .com crash. I didn't get to Google until 2011, but it became clear to me after joining that in the past they had gone on a very nerdy mission to hire all the nerdy people and collect them into one place to do nerdy things. (Unfortunately that nerdy thing ended up being selling ads really efficient, but that's another story.) My fundamental point is that the Google story is very unlike the kind of stories that YCombinator or a16z like. It started, like you said, as a set of intellectual/technical interests. The other stuff, that VCs today like, came later. In a way they did the opposite of the usual advice. They started with the hammer (the tech) rather than the nail (the business problem.) They certainly didn't start with a \"Like X but for Y\" statement like seems to be desired by VC today. And they didn't look like the typical .com story at the time (which was usually: give us lots of VC $$ so we can sell something on the web that is currently not sold on the web, but we'll just use the $$ to buy customers and make no profit...) I would posit that if today's Google came to YCombinator today they'd be shown the \"no thanks\" door. reply int_19h 6 hours agorootparent> Unfortunately that nerdy thing ended up being selling ads really efficient, but that's another story. The irony is that both the thing and its side effects were anticipated very early on. \"Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising.

It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media, we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\" (The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, 1998) reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentprevI think there's a connection here to the old adage that \"small companies make it possible, big companies make it inexpensive\".

I wonder if we really shouldn't make a bit more out of the fact that there are different types of startups: those that pick off low-hanging fruit really well, those that combine novel technology with novel problems (for instance, the recent YC LLM meeting note-taking / transcription service), those that are scientific-discovery based (see, for example the NSF Small Business Innovation Research program), etc. I am not experienced enough to create an ontology of startup ideas, but I think it'd be an interesting exercise. reply theGnuMe 14 hours agorootparentThe nsf program basically exists to fill the gap between research and product market fit.

Usually the advice from VCs is to start from the problem and iterate on the tech until you solve it. What was very fortunate for Google is that the tech translated into a great business problem. Open up any CS textbook and 'Search' is always a major section.

But I think PG was mostly looking for barely-20 year-olds to drop out of college, rent an apartment in Harvard Square together, and sit around hacking in towels.

But as a founder, when I give advice, out of inflated ego generally, I also have vertigo from the height of everything that could go wrong about being mistaken about my advice. reply holmesworcester 11 hours agorootparentI feel that worry too, but I can validate his advice, somewhat. I'm 44 and spent most of my career working individually and with my closest friends on projects that felt interesting, and it went really well for us in all of the ways. I also met these friends at a selective school, though it was a state-funded high school (massacademy.org), not a university. Also, someone once came to my very conventional elementary school in 5th grade on career day to talk about a very unconventional career path (being a full-time peace activist) and this had a huge impact on me, both because it validated activism as a career and perhaps more importantly because it validated not having a normal job. Getting a very short lecture in school from an interesting non-teacher can be at least very memorable and perhaps life-changing. reply cmrdporcupine 15 hours agorootparentprevBut that's the thing. \"Search\" was not a great business problem. It still isn't. I used Google for years before their IPO and people were always like \"how is this thing going to make money\" and believe it or not there was a lot of skepticism even at IPO time that they even had a possible reasonable business model. (Same for Facebook at their IPO, too.) Search is not a good business. Ad sales over top of search turned out to be. AdWords is the thing that catapulted Google towards (insane) profitability. And for the first few years, Google didn't really sell ads, or market themselves as even aiming to sell ads. But AdWords could only be successful because they had already captured the market on search, and so had a captive audience to show ads to (and relevance information based on their searches). AdWords rolled out in 2000. Many of us had been using Google as a search engine since before the company had even been founded (1998). reply light_triad 15 hours agorootparentTotally agree. What I mean is many research topics can be very interesting from a technical perspective but don't translate into solving problems that are frequent and important enough to build a business around. In the case of Search many business gurus didn't understand at the time that you can make a fortune with a free product. What matters is who has the traffic and who they're selling it to = eyeball meets ad. Page and Brin initially \"expected that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers\" (foreshadowing). Also they tried to sell to Yahoo for $1M so it took time to see the full potential, as you describe. reply neilv 15 hours agorootparentprevWhen Google started, you didn't need a business model for a \"dotcom\" (as we called them, before \"tech stocks\" became the \"tech\" that we now call ourselves).

Funny thing is I recall using Google from the very day I first saw it come across Slashdot -- probably late 1997 -- before they were incorporated even... but I also recall that at some point around 1999 I actually switched back to using AltaVista or something similar for a bit. Because I preferred the search results I got. It was actually a more competitive situation than people might remember in hindsight.

But the fundamental R&D had already been done. When I was at Google I saw some of it from a distance before I ever heard of OpenAI. The VCs have come along at the tail end of the R&D cycle on this stuff in hopes of cashing in. Same as they did with crypto and N number of trends before. They're trailing, not innovating.

And that work built off the incredible investments into California infrastructure by the US military during WWII (https://steveblank.com/category/secret-history-of-silicon-va...), which followed some amazing investments in education, transport, and housing since the beginning of the gold rush. But, in all honesty, if you want to identify single factors that truly contributed to Google not just surviving but thriving, I'd point at Jeff Dean. When he joined, Google was unable to update its index due to the design of the indexer. Jeff (along with Sanjay, or as many of us know him, \"The Wise One\"), built seminal software that enabled google to grow rapidly - not just updating the index faster, but doing search quality on logs, early ad experiments, and more.

It has taken about a decade of switching back and forth between consulting and working on the SaaS until I run out of money. Some consulting stints took a few months, others a few years, depending on our needs. As I grew older, our needs and risk aversion in the family increased, so I just took on longer or more financially interesting consulting assignments, to grow a bigger buffer and allocate some extra assets. I'm quite sure that, if I had just been consulting the last 15 years, I would already have been able to retire (owning more real estate and other assets). However, my life would have been very different, and every single time I took on an ad interim assignment, I noticed the impact of my SaaS building experience was a big plus for my consulting assignments... I'm not saying it's all rainbows & unicorns - building a SaaS is romanticized a lot, but IME it's an infinite game that requires a lot of grit, and as you grow you move the goal posts, so you're always in \"hard\" mode -, but I beg to differ that it has led to a more interesting life for me personally, as I tend to get bored quickly.

Same could be true for social media and many other types of services, but we don't know because we're not really trying to figure that out. The only question we ask when we are starting a business is \"are people willing to pay for this enough to make a profit?\".

What’s toxic is the extreme rush of it all. You don't need to be successful business owner at 22. In fact, sounds like a good way to distort your perspective on life, and business. Incubators seem to like young people because they are gullible and investors can offer them less and get more control. If it was so important to be young in business, then how come they should listen to advice from those old farts? That’s the part that bugs me, it seems exploitative. Another reason to play it slower is you can work and save for financial security beforehand, and you can build your network without going to MIT or Stanford.

Exchange plans are fine enough, and like, they're not that cheap, but they're also not that expensive either. Depending on how much you make from investments on your never have to work again horde, you may be able to qualify for rate subsidies, and then it's even less expensive. In my county, if I were 64 years old, assigned male at birth, I'm looking at about $17,000/year for a Blue Cross Bronze plan (less costly options available), with $9,200 out of pocket max. Budgeting $26,000/year for healthcare means less than $1 M should cover you for life (assume 3% perpetual withdrawal rate). Rates are lower for younger people, but budgeting based on current costs for the oldest people should help the numbers work. Double the budget if you have a spouse; do some math if you have kids you need to cover until they become independent. Definitely make sure you work until you have earned Medicare eligibility, cause it'll be handy when you reach that age. Is $1-2 M crazy-high? Kind of, but depending on what your annual withdrawal rate target was, maybe you can just say if you've got enough to pull $100,000/year, you're good on healthcare too. Hopefully most years you won't hit the out of pocket max. reply vundercind 13 hours agorootparent> maybe you can just say if you've got enough to pull $100,000/year, you're good on healthcare too. You’ll be exposed to tens of thousands in risk per year on top of (low) tens of thousands in premiums per year for a family Exchange plan. You’ll be burning nearly half of that (and spending all your free time trying to keep hospitals and insurers taking even more) if one of you gets cancer—or, if it’s you who gets cancer, you better hope someone else can handle that. You also can’t withdraw at as high a “safe rate” as people planning for an ordinary retirement at ~65 do, because your fund needs to last a lot longer despite inflation and such. $2m isn’t “retire at 35” (… or 45) money. It might be “take a big gamble and maybe get lucky… for a while” money. Or semi-retire money. [edit] at constant 2% inflation (ha!) you need a very safe source of consistent (not average!) 6% returns to retire with 80,000/yr income on $2m, without eating into principal. Anything goes wrong (“whoops, ‘safe’ wasn’t as safe as I thought!” or “whoops, we had a year of 7% inflation and my investments didn’t benefit from that!”) and you can find yourself burning principal while your account value is already down. It won’t take a lot of that before $80k is no longer your safe-withdrawal amount. A couple such years and you may be back to work. 30+ years is a long time… [edit edit] also damn under $10k max out of pocket on a family plan at the bronze level for $17k?

That’s better than our Gold plans (also our plans tend not to cover like 2/3 of area providers, which may include 100% of area specialists for certain situations) reply toast0 13 hours agorootparentMy budget includes the premiums and the individual out of pocket max. If that's not good enough, what number am I supposed to be looking at? My with a spouse budget is just 2x the individual budget, family out of pockets are usually around 2x individual in my neck of the woods, so that doesn't make a big difference; if there's kids, then it would, but the modelling there gets tricky because you've got to figure out what age you're kicking them off the plan (assuming they don't have a debilitating condition that leaves them dependent on you for their whole life... that falls outside my plan). > You also can’t withdraw at as high a “safe rate” as people planning for an ordinary retirement at ~65 do, because your fund needs to last a lot longer despite inflation and such. $2m isn’t “retire at 35” (… or 45) money. It might be “take a big gamble and maybe get lucky… for a while” money. Or semi-retire money. The $2 M is the budged accumulation only to pay for premiums and out of pocket until you hit Medicare; and that's assuming a spouse. Budgeting that based on perpetual withdrawl rate gives yet another buffer, because it only has to last until Medicare eligibility age. Yeah, there's unknowns, but whatever. I'm not saying $2 M is enough to accumulate for early retirement. It could be, but a lot of people want to spend more money than that. $2 M doesn't generate that much income, so you'll likely qualify for health plan subsidies, which would help a bit too. Edit: I used zipcode 98110, birthday for illustration 01/01/1960. Going into the less expensive side of my state, zipcode 99336; there's no blue cross out there, but the most expensive bronze plan for that birthdate is $14,000 / year with the same $9200 out of pocket max. And yeah, limited networks suck ... I'm not going to shop for hypotheticals there --- I'm pretty sure if there's no reasonable in network doctors, you can fight your insurance to get covered at a reasonable doctor, regardless of the insurance and state, and if you're early retired, you'll have time for it. reply lupire 12 hours agorootparentSome people think that if you can't spend a million dollars a year on healthcare for 50 years, you are poor.

Even here in Canada where healthcare is not really a cost, retirement and nursing homes constitute a huge expense that could go on for years in your last phase. I'm sitting on the accumulated wealth of 25 rather up-and-downish years in this industry, 10 years at Google, an almost paid-off mortgage, and a decent lump sum I got from when Google bought my employer, I turn 50 this year, and there's no way I can retire. Not without selling my home and moving somewhere a lot cheaper (hard to find here). Maybe I've made some bad financial choices (not that many), but mostly it's that compensation packages in our industry are set just high enough to keep people on the upper side of comfortable middle class. If you don't own capital -- haven't invested in rental properties or starting your own business --getting out of the job market isn't really a thing before 65 for most people even in our very well compensated industry. If I were single or it were just me and my wife, sure. I've been through tldroptions, and looked at enough options agreement given out by startups in the last few years, to know that as an IC engineer... even if you are lucky enough to be part of the very few startups that have a liquidity event... you're likely gonna get $300k, $400k USD tops. Unless you're 25 and can shove that in the bank without touching it at all... that's not the life changing event some people think it is.

Decision inertia means that employees often don't sell vested stock, and end up being lucky. Similarly, external investors aren't willing to put 30-50% of their networth into one bet and therefore miss out on the kind of luck that can set them up for life. There is nothing that a lowly engineer at Tesla or Nvidia knows, that can't be found out by an external investor.

And sure, you can always point out exceptions. The real point is that it's misguided to try and compare percentages of tech company employees with percentages of founders; they're very different things. Of course, out of all the founders of all the companies, a relatively tiny percentage will be vastly rich. And out of all the employees of all the tech companies, most will be quite wealthy and comfortable, and a small percentage will be vastly rich. But that doesn't tell you anything about what is the most reliable path for any given individual to get vastly rich; it entirely depends on whether you're the kind of person you are how well you can learn how to build successful products and companies. reply candiodari 16 hours agorootparentprevTesla has a VERY bad reputation on that front, as does SpaceX. reply adrianN 15 hours agorootparentprevA SF engineer pulling something like 300k can definitely retire before the age of 60. reply ojbyrne 6 hours agorootparentMany of them might be on their second or third layoff by 50. reply cmrdporcupine 16 hours agorootparentprevEven very early these days won't get you much.

Many of my own investors just worked as engineers at Microsoft for the right decade and are worth tens of millions. They worked really hard and sacrificed a lot, but they got paid every step of the way. Predicting which big tech company will do well enough in future to give you that big stock reward over time is a big gamble, but certainly a smaller gamble than doing a startup. I know plenty of people who have joined half a dozen startups, none of which yielded any gain. And many entrepreneurs who worked super hard many times and have nothing to show for it but scar tissue.

If you save a third of that (which is not easy) for 10 years you get to approximately $1.3 million. Maybe your investments get you above $2 million, but it would really depend on what decade that was. If you had the Great Recession in the middle of that, not so great. If you think it is easy to save more than a third of your income, remember you’ll have a federal marginal tax rate of 35% or higher, will probably have to work onsite in a HCOL state, and unless you’re lucky enough to live in WA, a high state income tax. Yes you can shield some of your income via 401ks and Roths, but for the former you’re going to get taxed on withdrawal, and for the latter you get penalized if you touch it before you’re 59.5.

I think a massively underappreciated mechanism by which American culture distorts history is by its very lax and sometimes supportive norms about fudging the truth and sometimes even outright lying to children reply kelnos 16 hours agoparentThe biggest thing missing from this talk -- something that would have been easy to include, even for a younger audience -- is that the majority of startups fail, and even many startups that do well enough end up making their founders less money than if they went to work for another company. It feels irresponsible to tell kids how they can build the next Google, without also telling them how likely it is they won't succeed at it. Granted, most people in their early 20s have very little to lose, so a failed startup may not be much of a problem, outside of the stress and emotional effects. reply advael 16 hours agorootparentI mean, like most advice from my generation and prior ones, the notion that people in their 20s can't fuck up too badly because they have little to lose applies considerably less well to all but the fairly affluent people in their 20s today. For many, taking risks means being gated out of the financial system by bad credit, being behind in an unforgiving job market, and possibly even destitution if they don't have a safety net of some kind To be clear, this was always true to some degree, but inequality is higher, industries have more power and thus workers have less, and safety nets that don't come from your parents being well-off are weaker (and fewer people's parents are well-off) than when I was a kid, and this has actually been true for a few subsequent generations of kids reply seanhunter 16 hours agoparentprevThe best advice to give children is that they should be born to rich, influential and well-connected parents. That will give them a huge advantage in all walks of life including if they want to start a startup. Larry and Sergei had the benefit of rich, influential and well-connected parents, as did Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Paul Graham himself. reply advael 1 hour agorootparentI think the place where this is most apparent in the speech is the bit about selective universities. It's interesting the way people like Graham talk about how universities work, because they're actually kind of the primary place where a particular sleight of hand happens. Every very wealthy person I've ever met believes wealth and intelligence to be tightly coupled. Some will even talk about these things as though they're completely equivalent. Universities kind of double down on this equivalence in some ways, as they are the de facto credentialing system for the job market, although there's some evidence that this is for the first time in quite a while becoming less true in some sectors, it's still a huge part of the reality of how social mobility is gated. So when Graham frames the role of \"selective\" universities in the success of various famous startups, he's totally right that they're excellent places to network. But his conception of their selectivity is pretty strange. It's pretty well-understood by now that a lot of mechanisms can get people into great schools via the wealth and influence of their parents rather than \"smarts and determination\". I once read someone who pointed out that bringing in a few \"scholarship\" kids who are less well off makes it seem like anyone could get in with the right grades and test scores, and the incentive is to have just enough of these to ambiguate who is there for what reasons. To launder the \"wealthy, well-connected\" with some \"smart, determined\" cred. It's telling therefore that he leaves out one of the most important parts of the networking value of universities: They're a great place to meet funders, and the top tier universities also have significant resources to facilitate student projects that may turn into companies, compared to other institutions reply lupire 11 hours agoparentprevWhy do think this is an \"American\" thing?

His brother Carl was already a multimillionare in tech and taught him everything required to set up a future successful company. Larry made it clear to me that he always planned Google to be a large cash-generating cow to invest in long-term AGI and there were only a few times at the beginning when he truly feared that wouldn't happen. reply shubhamjain 17 hours agoparentDo you have any sources for this? If he knew it was going to be this huge, why were they looking for an acquisition for north of a million dollars? On AGI: are you referencing this clip? [1] To me, it seems like an ordinary vision when you stretch your imagination. He didn't have any realistic idea how Google might achieve AGI, just something that could happen in the future. And this was in 2000. Google, I imagine, was pretty successful by then. Larry Page's original ambition was to digitize books and knowledge in the world [2]. > Page had always wanted to digitize books. Way back in 1996, the student project that eventually became Google—a “crawler” that would ingest documents and rank them for relevance against a user’s query—was actually conceived as part of an effort “to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library.” [1]: https://twitter.com/jam3scampbell/status/1608270969763729415 [2]: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-t... reply nostrademons 15 hours agorootparentAlso worked at Google in the 00s, and have spoken personally with several people who worked on Google when it was still a Stanford grad project. To hear Larry tell it, his original idea for Google was to download the whole web and throw away everything but the links, and he was inspired by academic notions of citation indexes. It wasn’t specifically (or really at all, until Google books came out) about books - that sounds like a cover story to get grad student funding for his actual idea, because you can’t really go to a university and say “I want to download the whole web and throw away everything but the links” without telling them why or connecting it to some plausibly useful idea. The acquisition offer is often cited, but I don’t think Larry and Sergey were ever really serious about taking it. They didn’t, after all. But if you’re living on a grad student stipend (which was like $20k in the 90s), a million bucks is a lot of money. And they absolutely knew it would be big, they just didn’t know how it would be big. It was quite popular within the Stanford lab as well…it’s interesting, looking through the early CVS commits for Google, how much work was done by people who ended up not actually becoming employees of Google or having a major part in its story. I think the real genius of Google was treating the web as an object that could be studied and manipulated, and not as some amorphous thing you were part of. That was exciting even if people didn’t know how it would be. reply dekhn 17 hours agorootparentprevmy source is larry himself- I used to work there and volunteered at SciFoo, which he attended and I chatted with him about it. The digital library is basically building a corpus for training AGI. His dad was a computer scientist and larry read a lot of AGI sci fi as a kid, so it's not really that hard to extrapolate 1980s technology to 2040s outcomes. reply jimkoen 16 hours agorootparentHis dad wasn't \"just\" a computer scientist, he was a professor for computer science and artificial intelligence at Michigan State. Sergey Brin's father was equally a professor in mathematics at the University of Maryland. > It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn't obvious at the time. It may not have been obvious, but the decision was damn well near as engineered with data as it could be. They also were _insanely_ well connected through their and their parents academic career. Both Sergey and Larry had obtained their PhD prior to starting the company. I can also remember reading that they obtained significant amounts of funding through connections Larry's dad had into the industry. You can ignore the rest of my comment, what follows is just my take. Their success story is imo one of the most blatant examples on how privilege really does give you a boost in life. I am not arguing that anyone could have done it, but I do wonder how the world would look like if we were all kids of academics with a successful career, with a relatively safe, secure and stable childhood home and a family background that really incentivizes learning and academic success over succumbing to the pressure of, you know, having an income at some point. reply dekhn 16 hours agorootparentI don't think larry or sergey got their phd - larry got a masters and I think sergey left before he got any degree. Don't forget that Larry's older brother Carl went through the whole VC process with egroups and gained extreme experience with how to maximize his position in negotiation. But yes, I agree completely that kids of academics raised in an environment that incentivzes learning is a reliable way to transform the future. reply nostrademons 11 hours agorootparentThe timing is a little muddled here - Scott Hassan (who, interestingly enough, wrote most of the original code for Google) founded eGroups with Carl Page in 1997, after working on BackRub/Google. The two should be viewed as parallel projects - Google actually started first, but eGroups raised money first. It’s true that Larry got valuable experience through having his brother raise capital first, but much of that also came from having supportive angels like (Sun founder) Andy Bechtolsteim, (Stanford professor and Granite Systems founder) David Cheriton, (Junglee and Netscape exec) Ram Shriram, and (Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos. reply jimkoen 14 hours agorootparentprevSo to correct my original statement: Both have a masters degree and both were pursuing PhD's before they focused on Google. But I consider them more than halfway there, afaik both have published papers separate from the paper that eventually lead to Google. This is taken from their own testimonials from their paper [0] The rest of my statement is true.

I recently read something that played out a thought experiment about \"imagine the world could only hold 10,000 people\". It may have been a comment somewhere on HN honestly. The idea was that if the world could only hold 10,000 people, there never would have been enough division of basic duties for any one individual to dive so deep that they could invent semi-conductors (insert any modern tech really). I mean we likely wouldn't even have mastered locomotion by now if that was the case. Lets assume we're \"all kids of academics with a successful career, with a relatively safe, secure and stable childhood home and a family background that really incentivizes learning and academic success over succumbing to the pressure of, you know, having an income at some point.\" Most of us will still just be working on the basic societal problems of producing food and taking out the trash. reply kla-s 12 hours agorootparentIt was on HN, this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39746742 reply jimkoen 15 hours agorootparentprev> I recently read something that played out a thought experiment With all due respect, the world isn't a thought experiment and the dynamics of a system with 10.000 people is not comparable to that of 7 billion. My argument was pointing at the fact that it may be pointless to compare your own plans to success against someone elses success story, when they had completely different starting variables in life and people who refuse to at least consider this are either trapped in the Silicon Valley hustle culture or are, sorry, completely ignorant, bordering on idiotic. With that same logic ala \"Not everyone can be X\" I can justify almost all of human suffering in the world. I refuse to believe that you follow an ideology like this if you're on this site, because if you did, you were already rich by means of some criminal enterprise exploiting humans far beyond what tech startups are capable of.

(Still not obvious if you ask me.) reply dekhn 16 hours agorootparentI'm the same age as Larry and started working in machine learning in the early 90s, and to me, it seemed pretty obvious at the time that AGI would ultimately need a large corpus of text (and video) to be useful. What's kind of funny is the models I worked with at the time- hidden markov models of (biological) text anticipated the validity of this approach, although by design, they don't work with long contexts. reply inerte 12 hours agorootparentprevIn the “Measure What Matters” book the author talks about investing in Google in early 1999, and the founders were indeed projecting billions of dollars in revenue, using ads. reply lupire 12 hours agorootparentprevDigitizing all the books in he world was an is an essential component of modern AI, a full two decades later.

One thing I've noticed is that Larry and Carl both have some behaviors that are consistent with ... inflexible thinking ... that I recognize in myself and have worked to correct. Anyway ,we chatted about his latest company, which I can't find now. The idea was this: industrial facilities often return really noisy signals on the electrical supply lines, and the electrical company has to do a lot of work to clean it up (hey, I'm not an EE). Like, motors, etc, all severely distort the waveform. So his company made and I guess sold a product that you'd put at your electrical service panel that \"cleaned up\" the signal before it went back to the power company. In response, the company would give you cheaper power prices. I was reminded of this when Larry Page met with Donald Trump early in the Trump administration and brought up one of his favorite plans- to rebuild the US electrical grid around DC distribution. He's truly made for another world. reply bearjaws 16 hours agoprevPaul Graham sounds like a boomer telling their kids to go apply in person or go door to door for jobs. Especially talking about Software startups, which will increasingly have a lower and lower barrier to entry (aka lower profitability) Theres simply no way to get away with what Google, Facebook or Uber did today. You will not sneak your software into enterprise customers, you will not be able to skirt regulations. Hell the big money pot of getting acquired may be dead too, e.g. Figma. For most startups, you will fail. For the top 1% of companies you can hope to at best make a comfortable living at a multi-million dollar valuation.

    "originLink": "https://brickinsights.com/statistics/ppp",
    "originBody": "Brick Insights Sets Statistics FAQ Search Search Not comparing apples to oranges anymore Price Per Part Can we really compare Price Per Part (PPP) between sets? A couple of weeks ago I received this question by Jared Hinton: \"Just a quick question on the PPP data. Most years have a average PPP of 20c+ per part. This sounds very high, especially when most sets come way under that (which are then marked as good value). Do Duplo sets get included in the years average PPP figure? Because they tend to be alot higher than LEGO sets. This is the only thing I could think of why the year average is almost double what I'd expect it to be.\" This is a very good observation, and something I hadn't really thought about. I built the PPP comparison when Brick Insights first launched in 2018, almost as an afterthought. I wanted to see if a set was worth buying from a MOCing point of view, and threw it in to help guide me. It was definitely time to take another look at those calculations. All numbers in this article are adjusted according to inflation to make them comparable over the years. This isn't something we did before this investigation, so thank you for that too, Jared! Check the FAQ to learn the details about this. All categories referenced in this article are collected from Brickset, where we get most of our set data. That's also in the FAQ. 150 set categories with average PPP and example sets 4 Juniors ($0.48) Action Wheelers ($1.58) Advanced models ($0.09) Adventurers ($0.19) Agents ($0.12) Alpha Team ($0.21) Aqua Raiders ($0.10) Aquazone ($0.20) Architecture ($0.13) Art ($0.05) Assorted ($0.15) Atlantis ($0.14) Avatar ($0.12) Avatar The Last Airbender ($0.10) Baby ($2.47) Basic ($0.21) Batman ($0.12) Belville ($0.37) Ben 10: Alien Force ($0.95) Bionicle ($0.25) Boats ($0.34) Books ($2.67) Boost ($0.20) Brick Sketches ($0.11) BrickHeadz ($0.08) Bricklink ($0.09) Bricks and More ($0.09) Building Set with People ($0.52) Bulk Bricks ($0.23) Cars ($0.14) Castle ($0.21) City ($0.18) Classic ($0.07) Clikits ($0.23) Collectable Minifigures ($0.45) Creator ($0.09) Creator Expert ($0.09) Dacta ($2.62) DC Comics Super Heroes ($0.14) DC Super Hero Girls ($0.12) Dimensions ($0.31) Dino ($0.17) Dino Attack ($0.14) Dinosaurs ($0.17) Discovery ($0.12) Disney ($0.16) Dots ($0.09) Dreamzzz ($0.10) Duplo ($0.97) Education ($0.94) Elves ($0.11) Exo-Force ($0.10) Explore ($2.15) Fabuland ($0.86) Factory ($0.11) Freestyle ($0.11) Friends ($0.13) Fusion ($0.16) Gabby's Dollhouse ($0.21) Galidor ($2.37) Games ($0.14) Gear ($0.24) Ghostbusters ($0.11) Harry Potter ($0.12) HERO Factory ($0.26) Hidden Side ($0.10) Hobby Set ($0.08) Homemaker ($0.21) Icons ($0.08) Ideas ($0.09) Indiana Jones ($0.12) Island Xtreme Stunts ($0.30) Jack Stone ($0.64) Juniors ($0.19) Jurassic World ($0.16) Legends of Chima ($0.16) LEGOLAND ($1.09) Life of George ($0.24) Make and Create ($0.08) Marvel Super Heroes ($0.13) Master Builder Academy ($0.15) Mickey Mouse ($0.39) Mindstorms ($0.78) Minecraft ($0.12) Minions: The Rise of Gru ($0.17) Miscellaneous ($0.27) Mixels ($0.09) Model Team ($0.16) Monkie Kid ($0.10) Monster Fighters ($0.11) Nexo Knights ($0.15) Ninjago ($0.18) Overwatch ($0.10) Pharaoh's Quest ($0.21) Pirates ($0.20) Pirates of the Caribbean ($0.18) Power Functions ($2.57) Power Miners ($0.16) Powered Up ($2.00) Primo ($1.78) Prince of Persia ($0.15) Promotional ($0.08) Quatro ($0.76) Racers ($0.13) Rock Raiders ($0.35) Samsonite ($0.32) Scala ($1.34) Scooby-Doo ($0.13) Seasonal ($0.13) Serious Play ($2.52) Service Packs ($0.77) Sonic The Hedgehog ($0.12) Space ($0.14) Speed Champions ($0.08) Spider-Man ($0.16) SpongeBob SquarePants ($0.13) Sports ($0.23) Spybotics ($0.43) Star Wars ($0.14) Stranger Things ($0.09) Studios ($0.40) Super Mario ($0.22) System ($0.09) Technic ($0.12) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ($0.12) The Angry Birds Movie ($0.13) The Hobbit ($0.12) The LEGO Batman Movie ($0.13) The LEGO Movie ($0.10) The LEGO Movie 2 ($0.14) The LEGO Ninjago Movie ($0.09) The Lone Ranger ($0.14) The Lord of the Rings ($0.12) The Powerpuff Girls ($0.14) The Simpsons ($0.10) Time Cruisers ($0.21) Town ($0.20) Toy Story ($0.17) Trains ($3.11) Trolls World Tour ($0.13) Ultra Agents ($0.12) Unikitty ($0.13) Universal Building Set ($0.18) Vidiyo ($0.19) Vikings ($0.10) Western ($0.28) World City ($0.16) World Racers ($0.14) Xtra ($0.28) Znap ($0.19) Average PPP for each category If Jared's suspicion is correct we ought to see that some categories have a much higher PPP than others, which would skew the comparison. Since we've got the PPP for each set, it's a simple matter to calculate the PPP for each category by averaging all individual values. If we display the average category PPP in a bar chart, we can quickly see if some categories differ a lot. Finding comparable categories Alright, Jared's suspicion is definitely correct - some categories sway the PPP comparison. The best way to solve this is by grouping the categories into comparable chunks. We want to ensure we compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, so to speak. Here's the breakdown I came up with. It roughly groups categories together by part types. Now, armed with this data, we can compare a set with other sets that are similar. You can see the grouping below, along with the average PPP of all times. But stick around - we can also see how prices have changed over the years! Baby (Average PPP: $1.45) Larger blocks for toddlers. Action Wheelers ($1.58) Duplo ($0.97) Explore ($2.15) Primo ($1.78) Quatro ($0.76) Junior (Average PPP: $0.65) Sets with larger parts, usually aimed at a younger audience to introduce them to the other themes. 4 Juniors ($0.48) Belville ($0.37) Fabuland ($0.86) Jack Stone ($0.64) Juniors ($0.19) Scala ($1.34) System (Average PPP: $0.19) The sets we most often think of when we think of LEGO.

With this grouping done we can do a quick calculation to figure out what the true Price Per Part has been over the years. Many people quote that a set should be priced at around $0.10 per part to be worthwhile. Is this the average? Looking at the data, System and Technic sets have been pretty stable around $0.11 - $0.13 per part the last couple of years. Other categories are higher. We might need to revise that guideline a bit! Play around with the chart below to have a closer look. You can toggle a category by clicking on it in the legend. Fun stuff! How do I use it? Whew, that was a rabbit hole, to say the least. With all of this done, the following things have now been improved on Brick Insights: Inflation adjusted prices: In addition to showing set prices in USD when we have them, we also show these prices adjusted to inflation. That means you can see what Rey's Speeder from 2015 would cost if it was released today at the same price. This goes for set price, price per part, and price per minifig. More relevant PPP and PPM comparisons: PPP and PPM now compares to the set's comparable category. Duplo, Electronics and other weird categories no longer skew the comparison for system sets! I have to say, doing this deep dive was super fascinating. I hope it'll prove useful to you. As always, let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements. Hold on! I want to dig deeper into the data! Happy to oblige - here's a bonus page with details. It contains charts displaying PPP and PPM for each category and comparable category over the years. Have fun!

Besides finding out that the Bugatti Bolide Technic set is a pretty good deal as a parts bag, I found that there's only a weak correlation between set size and PPP. The Dots sets throw a wrench in things, of course, and large Technic sets often have expensive electronic and pneumatic parts that must be considered. My conclusion was that PPP is useful as a bargain-hunting tool, but not as a model for broad price analysis. Here's that for anyone interested: https://old.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1328f52/detailed_lego... reply sandreas 2 hours agoparentLEGO is indeed pretty expensive these times. Not every set is that bad, but the most cars are not only expensive, but not even the best sets on the market... There is a lot of comparisons, but the most convincing one maybe the LEGO Ferarri (42125) vs. CADA Italian Super Car (C61042W) video[1] of \"Held der Steine\" (german youtube channel). The LEGO is \"parts only\" - the CADA is remote controlled with led lights near double the parts of the lego one for the same price. Many of the newer manufacturers are 100% compatible and provide near double the part count for a similar set. Even if some of them are shameless rip-offs and illegal to have in some countries, most of them are smaller companies with great part quality, prints (no stickers) and innovative designs (see CaDA® C61503W AMG One).

The clutching of Lego bricks is finely weighed and consistent. The colouring is brighter. They don't have nasty toxic smells and paints. The set catalogues are more diverse with many more themes. Set designs are original and matching the age group. There is also historical significance and nostalgia for certain sets and themes, and they can be re-released as new sets with modern building techniques and new parts. reply beAbU 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't think you can compare LEGO with not-LEGO... Firstly it feels a little sacrilegious, but religion aside quality is often uncomparable and there was this common meme from my childhood that your parents did not love you if you got knockoff LEGOs. Part of the reason why we buy LEGO is because it's LEGO. Buying some other brand (regardless of quality) does not hit the same way. reply WilTimSon 45 minutes agorootparentBut that's a learned behaviour, and one learned specifically thanks to decades of marketing. Sure, LEGO is quality, but it's not some unbeatable gold standard. At some point it simply becomes one of those things where people ask for Coke instead of Pepsi, even if they can't tell them apart - brand loyalty trumping the desire to simply get the product. reply Freak_NL 35 minutes agorootparentprevA local toy store here has one set of shelves filled with Sluban (about ⅓ the size of their Lego offering), and it's just bleak to see. The shop focused their Sluban offering on military hardware for some reason (perhaps because Lego doesn't do any of that), so you end up with drab boxes of greens and browns, in addition to looking just off in terms of accuracy of the parts. There's also a bunch of the 'fake' stuff on AliExpress, where you can tell the quality of the bricks is crap just by looking at the low-res photos. Getting the fit of bricks right is apparently quite hard to do if you want to offer lower prices than Lego does. reply bombcar 11 hours agoparentprevJust like the article, you really have to correct for outliers to make PPP work. It's more of a \"rule of thumb\" that you can use to determine if something is, as you said, a bargain worth getting even if it is outside your main area.

I didnt see any of the lego store by-the-pound model. An interesting method for sus-ing up what parts they had would be looking into the shipments to-from lego entities in NL and USA - sea shipping bills of lading can be found on import yeti (now obviously unless someone has digitized historic bills of lading, etc (and we all know that ship hands (pirates) and long-shoremen (mob) have famously been the definition of corruption - so we can hardly ever trust any bill of lading...

AH Check this out: https://i.imgur.com/7CjqVBW.png So you can see that they are ~1,000 lbs per shipment... rounding up - then remove ~30% for weight of packaging and basically you have 750 pounds of plastic bricks - then apply part existance probability and you can see how much of each part is being imported and a costing idea...

This has been the average, and it's so \"perfect\" that it has to be that Lego has been aiming for it. They've accomplished this by having more and more detail (read: smaller pieces) in newer sets. They appear to have been forced (or trying) to jump to $0.20 per piece in some sets (e.g., https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/cinderella-and-prince-cha... ) reply bleepblop 13 hours agoparentI have a new metric when it comes to lego kits these days. How many stickers are in the kit? And honestly it's too damn high. I have been pretty vocal to lego about this in the past and current times. If they can mass produce an uncountable amount of minifigs with detailed paint schemes; they can do the same for bricks in the set. I have a hard time believing it's nothing more than a cost cutting measure. And to add insult to injury; I have noticed their quality control slipping over the years. For example: in the past 40 years or so, I might get a kit with a piece missing once a decade? Within the past 10 years I have had at least 7 kits missing pieces. And the frequency keeps growing. As a long time lego enthusiast; they have been slowly losing my trust. reply breuleux 13 hours agorootparentHow many sets do you buy per year, out of curiosity? I got into Lego during the pandemic and bought around 50 sets in the past three years. Over that sample, the number of missing pieces was precisely zero. reply jacurtis 12 hours agorootparentI've also always questioned this. I have purchased about 60 sets in the past 4 years. I have a friend who has purchased well over 100 (he runs a Lego YouTube channel - he spends > $6,000 a year on Lego by his estimation). I have never had a missing piece. There have been two times when I thought I was missing a piece and then found it stuck in a bag or hidden under another piece. I've never had to write to Lego to get a replacement (which I've heard they are really easy to work with if it does happen). Out of curiosity, I just texted my friend to get another sample from him and he said it happened to him one time, but also admitted his kids might have been to blame. So when people claim that every other set they buy has missing pieces, I always feel like I am either the luckiest person to ever live, or maybe the pieces are there and certain people are just more likely to misplace or lose them in the building process. reply robinson-wall 12 hours agorootparentPerhaps set size is a contributing factor? I've bought two sets over the last few years, and both of them have had a piece missing. One was 1969 pieces (no prizes for guessing which set that is!) and the other 1222 pieces. Both occasions the pieces weren't structurally important, and were small decorative elements. reply phil21 9 hours agorootparentI've put together probably 50 sets over the past 5-6 years. I pretty much only buy the largest sets they make, especially Technic. I doubt I have many sets under 1500 pieces. I've yet to find a single missing piece so far. Many times we thought a piece would be missing, only to find it trying to escape somewhere. The plastic bags carry a pretty heavy static charge in dry winter conditions, and the tiny pieces love to stick inside those in the corners where they somehow turn damn near invisible. To be honest the quality control is pretty unbelievable. If someone tells me they had 6 sets with missing pieces over the past 5 years my initial reaction would simply be to not believe them as it's so easy to misplace a piece during a 2,000+ piece week-long build. I've misplaced dozens to the point of having to order replacements from ebay or whatnot - only to find the pieces lurking around my house before the new parts even arrive. The joke of the household is you need to order a replacement part and then you'll find what you're missing a few hours later by complete accident. I've found pieces in the strangest places. If you accidentally sit on one they will basically become one with your flesh, and I've found random pieces floating in the tub completely unexpectedly.

In other words, I would not expect the distribution of Lego sets that are missing pieces to be evenly or randomly distributed. reply pcthrowaway 10 hours agorootparentYes I was thinking the same thing. Certain factories may have worse quality control, and those sets end up in different regions from sets that come from better production facilities reply TylerE 8 hours agorootparentprevOne thing they do on the big sets is give you extras of the small stuff. Like if you need 10 of a 1x1 tile of a certain color, maybe they give you 11, or even 12. reply bleepblop 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't have children and I do all sorts of kits besides lego; with even smaller pieces. Either I have bad luck or I am careless. But you'd think with multiple decades under my belt I'd eventually find the \"missing\" pieces. When it's like a 4x12 left wing, or a 2x1 it starts to get suss. reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentThe only time I ever had a large piece like that missing, it was pretty clear (on afterthought) that the box had been opened in the store before I bought it. And I've had to return a set or two to Amazon because they'd clearly been opened and returned (and usually all the minifigs stripped out). reply bleepblop 11 hours agorootparentUnderstandable. I am pretty selective when it comes to a kit. Dare I say autistic? Box condition is a consideration, along with down to how I open them. It's noticeable. reply Larrikin 12 hours agorootparentprevMy experience is in fact the opposite. I usually buy the larger sets, and have nearly always had left over smaller pieces. It made me worried the first time it happened and I spent the time tracing back through the model only to find I didn't miss anything. reply jacurtis 12 hours agorootparentThey do precise weighing of bags as a quality control measure. The tiny 1x1 type pieces are more likely to get missed by the weighing so they often add an extra of those pieces to offset a potential loss that might not get noticed when weighing them. That is why you always get two helmet visors for example when you buy a speed champion. The machine is actually just designed to give you two, because that way if it breaks and misses one, you still have one that you need and it costs them almost nothing to do that. But a missing helmet visor is easy to get missed by the quality control scale. So if you ever buy a speed champion and only get one helmet visor, it is because you lost one or the machine broke. But that's why there's an extra. They do that by design. That's just one example. You see it with magic wands in Harry Potter sets, you always get two, and a lot of sets with 1x1 pieces will always have 1-2 extras just because they are cheap to add in and more likely to get missed in their QA process which weighs the bags. reply andruby 12 hours agorootparentprevEvery tiny 1x1 piece always comes with an extra. That must be by design. I think that’s calculated in their cost of doing business. Add one extra of each 1x1 probably eliminated most of the missing parts issue at a fraction of the cost. reply robertlagrant 11 hours agorootparentprev> and have nearly always had left over smaller pieces Almost every Lego set I've ever owned (going back 30+ years to when I used to get Lego) and now my son's Lego recently have all had at least one leftover piece. reply bleepblop 12 hours agorootparentprevI wish I could say the same.

I know I'm going against the grain here, but I love stickers.

In the Lego idea books they always showed those same stickers in use, making the association and relevance clear. So how many is too many? I mean, I'd say the more the merrier if that gives the set another dimension of play. reply bleepblop 12 hours agorootparentprevI am fully aware of the customer service side of lego. That's why I still use their stuff. But I suppose that is where our agreement will lie. Knowing what they are capable of and where they are now is noticeable. reply the_mitsuhiko 12 hours agorootparentI don't know. It very much depends on what you are into. I feel like a lot of the stuff that Lego does got way better in recent years. For instance the manuals in the app are a step above and beyond of where they were, and the build together element means that my kids are playing together and rebuilding old sets. reply bleepblop 11 hours agorootparentI am totally on the same page with you. It definitely boils down to what are you doing. There are a ton of cool pieces these days that would've been a pipe dream when we were kids. And lego's MO has always been imagination and creativity. I feel like the addition of stickers in essence sort of rules out the variable, but forces the builder to use it if they are following the kit by the book. Where as with a printed brick the person gets to choose whether they use it or not. It's really splitting hairs at that point, but ascetically speaking it doesn't fit their ethos. reply samstave 10 hours agorootparentprevLEGO needs to pull a KIA. First, they need the LLM instructions AI thingy to look at your pieces and instantly come up with inspiration. Gamify that. But they need to pull a KIA in that they hired the young designers away from GM and gave them some room. There needs to be a revolution in LEGO with the following: A device which is communally owned - at a Library or an Elementary School. Throw in plastic bottles and plastic waste. It molds LEGO bricks. And you can program different sets. And kids can create sets and have the device spit out the bricks for that set they designed. reply CrazyStat 9 hours agorootparentStrongly disagree on your mold idea. LEGO’s stringent quality control is one of the things that makes it great. My childhood legos are all at my parents house, and my kids love to play with them when we visit. They still work perfectly 30 years later. That level of quality is impossible with your local library mold idea. It would inevitably churn out low quality bricks due to (1) bad inputs and (2) molds not being replaced regularly for wear and tear, which would be accelerated due to (1). You can’t just throw whatever plastic trash you have into a machine and expect it to produce good or even useable bricks. reply lathiat 5 hours agorootparentprev\"First, they need the LLM instructions AI thingy to look at your pieces and instantly come up with inspiration.

The basic design was plastic bottles stuffed with plastic bags acting as bricks, which are then cemented together with cob. Cleaning the bottles and bags was incredibly difficult, even at the scale needed for a single bench. Just a massive amount of effort... The difficulty was that any residual bacteria would multiply and off-gas, eventually causing structural problems. Likewise, I expect the biggest problem for a home-LEGO-recycler would be dealing with the many random impurities in the input stream. reply TylerE 8 hours agorootparentLEGO is mostly ABS so its mechanical properties are a LOT better than the cheap stuff used for bottles. reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentprevI just wish the stickers were high quality plastic ones, so you'd have a chance in hell of removing and replacing them immediately if you mess up.

I got plenty of extra pieces too. reply Swizec 12 hours agorootparentprev> I have a hard time believing it's nothing more than a cost cutting measure. It's a \"keep bricks interchangeable\" measure. Every LEGO set designer gets a budget of a few new piece suggestions per year. This includes color and paint schemes.

That costs designers a frame. A new piece? Spend some frames. Bring back an old out-of-print piece? That’s a frame, too. Every year, design leads like Scott are given a limited number of frames that they can spend on their entire portfolio for physical pieces that aren’t readily at hand. “If I have five products or 10 products coming out, I need to allocate where those frames go,” says Scott. reply doubleg72 8 hours agorootparentprevEvery set I have bought for my kids comes with extra pieces.

I never saw a piece that doesn't fit, and the difference was mostly color and durability, where the no-brand technic bricks would fail earlier than the Lego ones when (ab)used for mechanically straining purposes, like a coat hangers, cup holder etc. The more interesting part: this opens up access to more original and specialized parts that Lego doesn't want or cares about, like a go pro mount for instance. reply bombcar 11 hours agoparentprevHotter tip - if you live near a Goodwill auction site, you can pickup \"in store\" and so you can bid for their bulk Lego without shipping. reply prawn 10 hours agorootparentIn case you never read this at the time - he's talked about it on HN a few times: Sorting 2 Metric Tons of Lego https://jacquesmattheij.com/sorting-two-metric-tons-of-lego/ reply dtgriscom 8 hours agoparentprevI'd love Salvador Dali Lego, as long as the pieces still clicked together. reply JKCalhoun 8 hours agoparentprevThe Persistence of Playtime reply Biganon 3 hours agoparentprevI feel like low heat would be beneficial to bacteria, instead of killing them...? reply bowsamic 1 hour agorootparentDishwashing and clothes washing are not designed to kill bacteria, even at high temperatures.

These parts are extremely cheap to produce, so you may have data that looks like price per part is flat, but in reality that’s because more of your sets are now from cheaper detailing parts. reply jerrysievert 11 hours agorootparenthaving collected through the 90's, I can attest that there are a lot less specialty parts now, but in recent sets that number appears to be growing again. almost every fairly large set I've purchased in the last 2 years have had 10-12 new-to-me parts in it, and the other sets continue to include those same parts as well. mostly, they've been pieces to make some change for SNOT, but there seem to be so many of them now that it feels like we're going back to that 90's mentality. some of those sets: * batman shadow box (with my first ever missing piece!) * dune ornithopter (great build) * loop rollercoaster (not counting those loop tracks) * orient express (my least favorite build in the last few years) reply lupire 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's quite dishonest to advertise \"# of pieces\". They should advertise \"$ of studs\". reply gmueckl 12 hours agorootparentprevI'd say yes and no. I find very few parts that are custom shapes for a single set these days. Most part shapes are very generic, but there is an absolutely wild variety of them now. There is an enormous number of SNOT, tile and slope pieces, for example. These can make slick looking builds, but getting a decent and useful collection of those for MOCs is hard. Where Lego gets tricky is the combination of shape and color: the color palette has been growing over the years, too, but most of the weirder shapes are only available in specific colors and not always the colors you would intuitively expect them to have. I guess it happens because manufacturing/stockpiling the whole outer product of shape x color is just infeasible at this point. So the available colors are just whatever is used in the current sets, however weird it may seem. reply Jean-Philipe 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, yes and no. Look at the Ninjago City sets where the designers have used special parts in very creative ways! Otherwise, I too prefer sets without special parts. The Minecraft and Creator series are excellent for that. reply paulddraper 12 hours agorootparentprevSo buy Lego Classic. They're not like 80s-era simplicity, but they definitely reuse peices. They're not rare; they're on every shelf. (But they're not Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc.) reply reaperducer 11 hours agorootparentBut they're not Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc. Isn't the point of Lego that every set can be Harry Potter, or Star Wars, or whatever you want? /Haven't Legoed in 45 years, but have fond memories. reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparentI guess if stormtroopers are some yellow-headed guy with a red hat... reply dudul 10 hours agorootparentprevDo you have some example?

Yes there are more parts created all the time, but you can still use them in very creative ways. reply boplicity 12 hours agoprevLego is a plastics company; they're trying to become net-zero, but, unfortunately, being a plastics company, this is extremely hard: https://www.ft.com/content/6cad1883-f87a-471d-9688-c1a3c5a0b... reply GuB-42 9 hours agoparentLego may be the most \"eco-friendly\" plastics company in existence. Not because their factories and materials are special, but because they are among the most durable plastic items there are. Lego last essentially forever. 50 year old bricks are still in use today, I don't think I have ever seen people trashing Lego. They are actually quite valuable and very easy to sell. I think the only significant losses beside a few accidents are sets that end up, unused, in attics. But they are not really lost and may get a second life as they get rediscovered. This may be the ultimate sustainable toy. I mean, name another toy that is still usable and didn't get obsolete after nearly 100 years. The most surprising part to me is that they are still selling. Maybe that thanks to adults, I don't know how long it will last. As for their packaging, it is mostly cardboard, they use less plastic than almost everyone else. In fact, they are going towards no plastic packaging at all. reply Libcat99 7 hours agorootparentI also have a hard time imagining Lego didn't inspire Minecraft and similar games, at least a little. An even more sustainable resource. reply mtreis86 9 hours agorootparentprev> name another toy that is still usable and didn't get obsolete after nearly 100 years Lincoln Logs are just over 100 years old. An original set, if any exists, should still be usable. reply magnetowasright 11 hours agoparentprev> The world’s largest toymaker announced two years ago that it had tested a prototype brick made of recycled plastic bottles rather than oil-based ABS, currently used in about 80 per cent of the billions of pieces it makes each year. However, Niels Christiansen, chief executive of the family-owned Danish group, told the Financial Times that using recycled polyethylene terephthalate (RPET) would have led to higher carbon emissions over the product’s lifetime as it would have required new equipment. I just thought that particular issue around new equipment was interesting. reply elzbardico 12 hours agoparentprevWhy?

Most other sets were an awful value in comparison. As an adult, I realized buying new was idiotic when I could just buy used. I ended up buying a former lego employee's collection for $60, selling the monorail it contained for $1000, and keeping the massive washing-machine sized rest for myself.

I suspect (based on my feelings) that licensing is less per set than you might think, and that the price per pound has been trending up as piece size trends down. reply NickNameNick 12 hours agorootparentI'd expect 2 small pieces to weigh more than 1 big one. So I'd expect you to see the weight go up faster than the part count. Not sure if that would confound or exagerate the trend. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentThey’re not replacing a 1x4 with 2 1x2s, they’re just designing sets with more pieces per pound (by having smaller pieces for decoration). reply coin 4 hours agoprevThat is one slow chart reply kromem 10 hours agoprevWhat happened in 2010?

Thus, when he plugged in his 3d printer and was confronted with some driver or configuration problems he threw his hands up, said it was junk, and went back to roblox. Trying not to sound too much like a 'kids these days!' rant, but that is what happened (yes, in this one anecdotal case). I think we're doing everyone a disservice by abstracting away all the underlying layers to the point that people don't have to interact with the filesystem, but that's a whole different subject. reply oofbey 10 hours agoprevI'd love to see a chart of lego part prices over the years.

Thanks for checking out Godspeed, I'd love to hear your feedback! https://godspeedapp.com/ kareemm 16 hours agoLove it. I've been increasingly dissatisfied with Things. Specific things I'm looking for in a Todo manager: 1. iPhoneMac apps and syncing 2. Hotkeys + Speed 3. Shared lists (you don't even mention this until I get into Guides, but I love it) 4. Smart lists 5. Nesting 6. Pasting images 7. Projects + subtasks 8. An inbox 9. Snoozing to the future 10. Focus mode (gets rid of everything else EXCEPT for the current task... really nice as a reminder when I start a task, hop into a meeting, and flip back to the todo list to see what I'm meant to be working on and it's staring me in the face vs. seeing a long list of items). Don't think you support this - first saw it in Amazing Marvin. Concerns: 1. How painful will it be to import from Things? 2. What if the app goes away? I don't want to lose my stuff or switch again, it's a pain. How big is your company? Are you a going concern with real customers or is this a side project that will fall by the wayside? 3. I do love not paying a subscription for Things. I like the $150 one-off fee for 18m. Would consider that. Regardless, going to play with it today. Seems very promising! reply lelandfe 15 hours agoparent$150 is $90 more than getting Things for iOS and macOS. I'm a big Things user, will be curious to see if this is worth the price. Shame that it only nets you 18 months, and seemingly no support guarantee. I'm also curious how limitless bug fixes for older versions is going to work out. \"Godspeed will never stop working\" feels like a bold claim to make given enough time in \"never.\" I've been using Things for 6 years now. reply kareemm 15 hours agorootparentAgreed re: 18 months. Been using Things for 8-9 years now, tried Sunsama, Todoist, and Amazing Marvin but keep coming back to Things. Godspeed looks interesting enough vs Things to kick the tires b/c: 1. Speed of date picking and moving todos (choosing dates in Things is a mouse operation and I do it multiple times a day. It's 2024 guys, we don't need calendar pickers when we have command palettes) 2. Image support (super annoying I can't include files in Things. Again... 2024, come on) 3. Sharing lists (can't do in Things which doesn't respect that todos are often collaborative / shared) reply lelandfe 15 hours agorootparentCultured Code's rate of development is my greatest negative, lol.

I'm not sure if Things lets you export tasks, but if they do I'm more than happy to run a one-time custom import for you (or any other Things user). There's also the simpler way, which is copying a bunch of tasks to your clipboard and hitting ⌘+Shift+V in Godspeed to paste tasks from clipboard. It'll respect indentation and bullet characters. > 2. What if the app goes away? I don't want to lose my stuff or switch again, it's a pain. How big is your company? Are you a going concern with real customers or is this a side project that will fall by the wayside? Important question, thank you for asking it. First, if the app goes away, you're able to export your data from Godspeed. Currently it exports as JSON, but we're going to add other export formats in the future (as well as attachment exporting, which we don't currently support - though all your attachments are stored in a particular folder in ~/Library). We're small right now, just a few people. But this app is pretty cheap to run and we use it every day (I don't want to brag, but I'm currently at the top of the charts for # of todos with 22,000 :p). So for what its worth, we intend to be around for a long time. Thanks so much for the feedback and for checking it out!

I loved Things on my iPhone until I saw the Mac version is another CAD 70. Now I use vanilla Obsidian with checkboxes - super simple, and I own the file. There's no snoozing though - you have to cut-paste a task into a different todo list if you want to move it. I'm sure there's also a plugin that would make it more org-mode-ish. reply xianm 10 hours agorootparent> you have to cut-paste a task into a different todo list I wrote a template for my Daily Note which includes a Tasks section. Underneath the list of tasks for the day, I use a Dataview to create a collapsable \"Backlog\" section, which selects all uncompleted tasks from my Daily Notes folder with a created time before the current file. It ends up looking something like: ### Tasks - [ ] Task 1 - [ ] Task 2 >[!todo]- Backlog > #### 2024-03-18 (1) > - [ ] Uncompleted task from 2024-03-18 Daily Note > > #### 2024-03-17 (2) > - [ ] First uncompleted task from 2024-03-17 Daily Note > - [ ] Second uncompleted task from 2024-03-17 Daily Note The cool part about this, aside from being able to show/hide the Backlog, is you can mark a task as done from the Backlog section, and it will update the original Daily Note file, and remove it from the Backlog section. Here's the Dataview query I'm using: >[!todo]- Backlog > ```dataview > TASK WHERE startswith(file.folder, \"Daily Notes/\") AND !completed AND file.ctime``` reply kareemm 15 hours agorootparentprevI have both Things for Mac and iPhone.

I haven't been able to come to a happy medium between them all. Also Concern #3, is there a subscription for things? o.O reply al_borland 8 hours agorootparentI think the more tools you have, the harder it gets. I see some of these productivity guys, like Ali Abdaal, on YouTube and their systems look like a nightmare, with 8 different apps depending on the type of data. The easier I make it on myself the better. At work, after trying seemingly everything, I think I hit my stride with Obsidian. I have a plugin to show a calendar that works with the daily notes. I setup a template for that with a todo heading and a notes heading. I treat that kind of like a bullet journal. Each day I move over the stuff that wasn’t finished from the last day. The notes section is to give me a scratch pad for stuff that I only need that day. Other notes go to their own page to easily find later (with none of that zettlekasten nonsense). If I have a lot in my mind at the end of the day, especially on a Friday or before vacation, I’ll fill out the daily note for the day I plan to be back in the office, so I can remember where I left off. I can also open up a future daily note to add an item if I need to follow up on something on a certain day. For normal meetings I use Outlook, because I have to. At home, the above system doesn’t work so well, because I have a lot less going on. I don’t need something that requires daily interaction like that. I have been writing up some ideas for an app I plan to write that will hopefully solve this problem for me. Time will tell how that plays out. In the meantime I’m using Apple Reminders and Calendar in a pretty basic form. reply danielecook 5 hours agorootparentprevI use a notebook and pen. It's like having another screen, except it's my list of todo's and its always open and in front of me. I write a list of todos, check them off as I go, then rewrite that list once the page is full or after a few days - leaving off those that are done. I've found it works better than any app (and I have tried many). reply monooso 8 hours agoprevI'm curious how this is better than (or even significantly different to) Todoist [1], a well-established cross platform application which also supports natural language task creation [2] and a keyboard-driven workflow [3].

A reminder will stay on the Lock Screen as notification until marked as complete. Any other todo app can give me a one time notification. But if I don’t act on it, the notification is gone (or hidden below the fold at best) and unless I open the app, the todo item is again “dead” to me. This is definitely Apple allowing its own apps access to features closed off for others, but this unique capability is what will keep me on the stock Reminders app forever. reply sleight42 12 hours agoparentCouldn't reminder apps implement \"nagging\" such that dismissed notifications are re-notified until some action is taken?

E.g. how many days is \"1 month from today\" (March 20)? You mention medicine, so I assume there's something obvious I'm missing (then again, perhaps the constantly shifting dates for health care appointments where I live say otherwise ;D). reply syvl 8 hours agoparentprevOur date picker already supports similar queries: 60m, 1d, 2w, 12mon. You can even combine them, like `2w+3d`. (I skipped n-10 because it doesn't support picking dates in the past.) Thanks for sharing, it's interesting to learn about the medical shorthand regardless :) reply mrinterweb 15 hours agoprevThis looks great and I appreciate the demo period and the option to buy one-time. Do wish the buy one-time had a longer update length. The subscription looks like the better deal. The $149 / 18 months is $8.28/month.

There are entire suites of software that cost less than $150 to own. Microsoft Office Home, Windows 11, Photoshop Elements 2024, Premiere Elements 2024... I'm just saying I think the buy to own price is an order of magnitude too high relative to other significantly more complicated pieces of software. reply onion2k 2 hours agorootparentPrice is a function of value, not cost. In this case the value is in managing your tasks in a way that means they get done. The sheer number of To Do list apps and services should tell you that this is truly a hard problem to solve - managing a task list is trivial, but doing it in a way that drives someone to do their tasks is immensely difficult. If the app enables you to do that then $150 to actually keep on top of tasks you need to do is an amazing bargain. reply smukherjee19 6 hours agorootparentprevI have to agree. I don't mean to disrespect the existing app, it looks really good and well-polished, but... as someone new to the MacOS ecosystem, $150 feels highly pricey. It's as costly as a Windows / Office license! At the same time, there are apps like Mindkit [0], which seem to do similar things as this, but with more features, but which cost 3000 JPY(20 USD) lifetime. Personally, the only time I can justify 150 USD for a purchase of an app is when it has as many features or is as impactful as Word/Excel/Powerpoint combined.

I've tried multiple times to automate them, but the automation ends up with more costs than benefits. reply Fnoord 7 hours agoprevI'd love this for Nextcloud, having it sync to there, in an openly documented format. You see, I already got burned by Google Keep and their proprietary format once. So then it'd be worth it to buy an application like this with a good UI and decent keybindings. But not for this price... 150 USD for 1,5 years of software updates. Look at Sublime Text. Sublime Text 3 was released in 2013, and Sublime Text 4 in 2021. That is approx 8 years of software updates for a big piece of software, top of line. For what was it like 100 USD? If you bought it later in the dev cycle, you'd get a discount on next. And it is cross-platform and native (no Electron). So you really are looking at 1 USD per month. A bargain. I've been looking at Obsidian and Zettlr (not exactly same) but these too are just Electron apps. Although they seem to be cross-platform, and the document format is just MD. Zettlr is even FOSS. What Nextcloud doesn't have (for me at least) is that the MD files can be edited and viewed by me and my wife at the same time. So with regards to one use case (grocery store shopping list) that is a minus. On Google Keep it worked, sort of. Maybe if you have a high income this is peanuts to you, but for me, it just isn't.

Extensive Shortcuts support (ala Things) is a minimum. AppleScript or JavaScript is better. I won't use a to-do app without a start date. Don't remind me to renew my driver's license 3 years in advance. I don't even want to see that. Everything that's due far in the future that I couldn't be working on today even if I wanted to is just a distraction. I can't deep link directly to an item. That means I can't use it with things like Hookmark, or have a note in another app that links back to its related project. I can't legally use it without end-to-end encryption. That's a deal breaker for anyone in a regulated industry, and I don't want to have one to-do app for work and another for personal stuff. This looks really cool! Each one of the above items would keep it out of the running for me, though. reply DanielDe 14 hours agoparent> How do I script it? We don't have a story for this yet, but we will.

Music also doesn’t match the low, quiet LockpickingLawyer-esque voiceover. Which I thought was fine, seemed sincere, scrappy, matches the brand.

I don't like the non-native looking font. The sidebar isn't collapsible or resizable like a mac app, but I guess you could add an editor-style shortcut to toggle that.

The way this worked in OmniFocus was _infuriating_ to me. When you snooze a recurring task in Godspeed you use the same date picker as for setting a date, so you have full power and flexibility to choose whatever date/time you'd like. And it only snoozes _this instance_ of the task, without changing future recurring due dates. reply KingGeedorah 15 hours agoprev> However, 18 months after a one-time purchase, you'll no longer get access to new or updated features. Is this normal for SaaS? reply 1123581321 14 hours agoparentIt's increasingly common. This particular one is a bit of a headscratcher since typically pay-once-for-an-update period is presented as a de facto subscription, but this also has a subscription. In this case, you'd pay $150 for an 18-month window of updates, or $144 for two years of updates (or, if you like, $72*1.5 for the same 18-month window, assuming you're going to pay another $150 at month 19 for something interesting.) Contrast that with Agenda, which is $35 to buy with 12 month of updates, or about $100 for a life-time of updates. The tradeoff is more straightforward as you're just deciding whether to bet on more than three years of features. Or contrast with OmniFocus which is $150 for the major version, which typically is on a 4-5 year cicle, or $5/mo. In that case you're just betting that you'll use the current major version more than 2.5 years. (I'm ignoring cashflow discount; you get the idea.)

It is just one payment for 18 months of subscription to new features which makes it slightly more expensive than monthly subscription. Go figure. reply DanielDe 9 hours agoparentThe difference is that with the one-time payment you get to keep the version you have forever, including bug fixes, compatibility updates, and cloud sync, which are all ongoing costs for us. With the subscription, you lose access when you stop paying. So I think it is pretty comparable to an old school one-time payment, but with bug fixes and compatibility updates added on top. reply threetonesun 13 hours agoparentprevThe \"old skool\" was pay once, get (usually) 0 updates and then pay again for a new major version.

Most of them provide abstraction layers that handle low-level input events, including keyboard input, with a consistent API across platforms. They also adhere to established standards like ISO/IEC 9995 for keyboard layouts and XKB for X Window Systems. Additionally, platforms often provide dedicated input method libraries (e.g., IBus on Linux, TSF on Windows) that these frameworks can leverage to handle different keyboard layouts and input methods seamlessly. Not to mention the focus on localization and internationalization (L10n and I18n) in modern software development practices, which includes support for different locales, character encodings, and input methods out of the box. While there may be some edge cases or platform-specific quirks to consider, the challenges of handling different keyboard layouts are generally well-understood and addressed by the frameworks and their active communities. reply tunesmith 15 hours agoprevJust curious if it supports blockers and dependencies?

However, there are a couple options you could use: 1. Use nested tasks for this purpose. If task B is nested beneath task A, then B is a dependency of A. Godspeed supports infinite nesting (okay, okay - MAX_INT levels of nesting) 2. You could use labels and smart lists.

If you copy a list of tasks with some kind of leading bullet character, like a `-`, and then hit ⌘+Shift+V in Godspeed, Godspeed will create tasks from the text on your clipboard. It'll even respect indentation and strip off the bullet characters. I'm also happy to do a custom, one-off import if you can get me any kind of machine readable file. reply mulderc 14 hours agoparentprevI feel like Omnifocus has good keyboard support, particularly enjoy quick entry support.

Personally I pay less than 1/2 the sub rate they're charging for TickTick Premium, and love it. That's not to say I wouldn't pay double for what it gains me (I definitely would), but given that TickTick is a viable option - I don't need to. reply kareemm 15 hours agorootparentIf you organize your life using a todo app then $8/m is not even worth thinking about.

My main concern is risk of eventual bloat, but so far it hasn't been an issue. I feel like it does a good job of letting you pick and choose what you want to use, hiding the rest. Side note: although TickTick supports notes, I don't use them. I dig UpNote, another not-super-well-known but simple, cross-platform, and inexpensive tool.

(Including prior purchases of earlier versions, and similar price points.) With todo apps, I don't really expect the same sort of constant on-slaught of features like I do from other things. I expect it to continue to work and get out of the way. I expect the price to reflect the fact there was a lot of upfront work to get it \"done\" to a level where I can just use it. [0] https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/buy/ reply busterarm 15 hours agorootparentRight, but by choosing to go keyboard-focused it's competing in a space with very feature-rich Vim and Emacs plugins (and users who want to work out of those) that are free. Even the Sublime users have lots of options already. Sublime is ALSO a very capable text editor and $100. reply larrysalibra 15 hours agorootparentThe OP is likely trying to deliver something like Superhuman ($30/month) - speed and keyboard focused-email - but for todos. I would imagine there is very little overlap between that market and people who use vim or emacs + plugins. reply graypegg 15 hours agorootparentprevFair, though I do think there's value you might be discounting here that ISN'T keyboard shortcuts. The market isn't all vim/emacs users, it's complex Omnifocus-style todo app users, who are frustrated with the lack of keyboard support in those apps. These users are more comfortable with this price point than you may expect (IMO) but will need feature parity for things like OmniFocus perspectives/floating timezones/easy outlining. A CLI app is not something I would want to use for something I touch every 30minutes, every day, from many devices. But I do use vim for text editing. reply lycopodiopsida 12 hours agorootparentOF keyboard support is fine - and I say it as an ex-emacs and current neovim user who works in terminal.

Emacs users have Org Mode and MobileOrg and can store the sync data somewhere they have full control over. reply 1123581321 15 hours agorootparentprevExactly; this is aimed at current OmniFocus and Things users.

Pen and paper worked great for me when I did everything at a desk (or carried a notebook with me) and I was always doing deep focus work. I went digital when I started being more mobile in my work and I had a lot of contexts where I needed to jot quick TODOs as I thought of them. Also, it's difficult to collaborate with my wife using paper. The inbox mechanic for tasks works great, because I don't need to add all my task metadata right away. I can also annotate projects and contexts so I can say \"what are my TODOs when I'm at home\" or \"what are my TODOs related to a person on my team\". Now that I'm tracking over 20 things, it's necessary to stay organized reply bibliotekka 13 hours agorootparentThe Cortex Sidekick Notepad is pretty great for analog task management.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread Root cause of Alzheimer's may be fat buildup in brain cells, research suggests by Bob Yirka , Medical Xpress Representative immunofluorescence images of human frontal cortex adjacent to the tissue used in snRNA-seq experiments stained for microglia marker IBA1 (green), ACSL1 (red) and DAPI (blue) in an aged-matched healthy control subject (left), an AD-APOE3/3 subject (middle) and an AD-APOE4/4 subject. Credit: Nature (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41586-024-07185-7 A team of neurologists, stem cell specialists and molecular biologists affiliated with several institutions in the U.S. and led by a group at Stanford University School of Medicine has found evidence that the root cause of Alzheimer's disease may be fat buildup in brain cells. The study is published in the journal Nature. Prior research has suggested that Alzheimer's disease is caused by a buildup of beta-amyloid in plaques that grow between nerve cells. Other work has also implicated a protein called tau, which can build up in brain cells. Thus, most work involved in developing ways to prevent, slow or stop the disease is based on reducing or eliminating such buildups. But as the researchers with this new effort have found, there may be something else at the root of the development of the disease. Back when Alzheimer's disease was first identified by Alois Alzheimer, he noted that in addition to the plaques and tau buildup, there was also a buildup of fat droplets in brain cells. Since that time, little effort has been made to determine whether they might be the cause of the disease. The research team therefore focused on the function of the APOE gene—prior research has shown that it encodes for a protein involved in transporting fat droplets into nerve cells. Prior research has also shown that there are four APOE variants, numbered 1 through 4, and that one of them, APOE4, carries the most fat into brain cells, while APOE2 brings the least. The team wondered if the APOE variants carried different risks for developing Alzheimer's disease. To find out, they conducted a few experiments. In the first experiment, the researchers used single cell RNA sequencing to identify the proteins inside of a test nerve cell. They applied what they found to tissue samples collected from people who died of Alzheimer's disease who had dual copies of APOE4 or APOE3. They found that the brains of people with the APOE4 gene had more immune cells with a type of enzyme that boosted movement of fat droplets into brain cells. In another experiment, they found that applying amyloid to brain cells of people with the APOE4 or APOE3 variants made the cells accumulate more fat. According to the researchers, the results indicate that buildup of amyloid in the brain triggers the push of fat into brain cells, leading to Alzheimer's disease. More information: Michael S. Haney et al, APOE4/4 is linked to damaging lipid droplets in Alzheimer's disease microglia, Nature (2024).

Been studying folks with only one working CYP21A2 due to the resulting atypical adrenal function and I noticed that their dna also contains all the genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's (some are beneficial in this case). Inquiring about the family tree of the single CYP21A2 I have yet to have someone tell me of an ancestor that died of Alzheimer's. But the family members with two good CYP21A2 (and all of the other typical Alzheimer's genetics) are the ones that end up with Alzheimer's. And for good measure, when someone has 3 CYP21A2 nearly always they will get Alzheimer's. (they also end up with Hypercortisolism). Subclinical Hypercortisolism has a long association with Alzheimer's. A deficient CYP21A2 and the decreased incidences of Alzheimer's is not talked about other than the fact that it isn't associated with Subclinical Hypercortisolism, but Subclinical Hypocortisolism instead. All of the known indirect early preventative measures for Alzheimer's result in shifting from Subclinical Hypercortisolism towards Subclinical Hypocortisolism.

Your metabolism may cause states worse than other people, sure. But that pound of butter you ingested isn't directly causing rises in the bloodstream to infinity. It's long-term accumulated burden and excess over time. Cholesterol levels don't track intake directly.

The remainder, presumably, was used for new protein synthesis. The total amount of glucose entering the circulation from all sources was calculated to be 50 g over the 8-h period.

This gives very high visibility to very fringe ideas. Giving undue weight to fringe viewpoints is promoting those viewpoints. reply Dig1t 5 hours agorootparentPromotion: \"activity that supports or provides active encouragement for the furtherance of a cause\" Simply discussing an idea, even giving undue weight, is not promotion. Conflating the two is dangerous as it provides justification for censorship. The free exchange of ideas and information is the only way a democracy can survive. If the idea is bad or wrong, it will be debated and ultimately defeated in the marketplace of ideas. reply lpapez 2 hours agorootparent> If the idea is bad or wrong, it will be debated and ultimately defeated in the marketplace of ideas. This implies the existence of a marketplace of ideas where people can freely trade thoughts. It was not the case in the past (i.e. you go to jail or are excommunicated for dissent), and it is increasingly not the case in the modern world (i.e. the algorithm is telling you what they want you to hear). You cannot have a free marketplace of ideas in a world where the forums these ideas are being discussed have an incentive of causing conflict and keeping you engaged. This is not an attack on you or anything, I just think we should all be more aware that everything we hear today has an agenda hidden behind it, which is malicious more often than honest. reply Nursie 2 hours agorootparentprev> If the idea is bad or wrong, it will be debated and ultimately defeated in the marketplace of ideas. Sure, and I have a bridge to sell you. The marketplace of ideas is a myth predicated on the willingness of participants to promote and evaluate their ideas honestly, and due to that honesty to stop promoting such ideas when they are shown to be wrong or inadequate. It requires participants to even be interested in how good their ideas are and be open to discussing them and changing views if these ideas are found wanting. Observing real life, what we have is people flooding the zone with unmitigated faeces, either for profit or idealogical motives. They are uninterested in whether these ideas are true, good or even useful, whether there are 'better' ideas, and they often dominate through volume and repetition. Tribal cohesion ensures the spread of ideas as much or more than honest debate. The marketplace of ideas is dead, if it ever really existed. A fairytale for children. reply watwut 2 hours agorootparentprev> If the idea is bad or wrong, it will be debated and ultimately defeated in the marketplace of ideas.

What some people call type III diabetes. I ask because one of the hallmarks of insulin resistance is the presence of lipid droplets in close proximity to mitochondria [0]. [0] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10455923/ reply levocardia 9 hours agoparentThere's a really interesting paradox where, compared to healthy adults, intramuscular lipid droplet storage near mitochondria is increased in: 1) People with obesity 2) People with type 2 diabetes 3) People who do endurance exercise Even though #3 is highly protective against #1 and #2. The best explanation I've seen is that the important difference is why the lipid droplets are being deposited [1] [1] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-005-1509-0 reply teaearlgraycold 9 hours agorootparentIf I am rich enough to have a down payment for a Bay Area house I’ll be tremendously in debt. But that wouldn’t put me in the same boat as someone with oodles of credit card debt. I’m guessing in endurance athletes it’s there because it’s about to be used. In the obese it’s there because they’re running out of places to put fat. reply levocardia 8 hours agorootparentRight - but even then, if a super fit endurance athlete stops exercising, they don't immediately become diabetic. The upstream cause (what biochemical stimulus is driving the fat deposition?) is probably where the key insight lies. reply aulin 4 hours agorootparentIf I recall correctly there were some studies that actually showed endurance runners have higher type 2 diabetes risk. And the suspect cause was the diet, specifically the carb loading practice and the abuse of high sugar products during the activity. So the three categories may actually share the same baseline, insulin resistance. It was quite controversial when it emerged (see Tim Noakes story), not sure if it's more accepted these days. reply lelanthran 3 hours agorootparentThis is very interesting to a diabetic like myself, who is slightly underweight.

You’re measuring the output to a multi-variate function. There should be no expectation that this one output drives other occasionally correlated outputs to other functions. reply trhway 5 hours agorootparentprevDoesn’t diabetes mean that the cells has to extract more energy from those lipid droplets instead of from the glucose pathway impacted by the diabetes? Thus in the cases of 2 and 3 those droplets is an additional significant source of energy. I also think that in the case of 1 the cells may be starving on glucose pathways (pre-diabetes), similar to 3 during the exercise and to 2 in regular situation, and that causes the over-eating while all that food doesn’t feed the cells because of the original issue and thus goes into fat for storage and into the lipid droplets way of feeding the cells to workaround the original glucose pathway issue. reply m463 10 hours agoparentprevsleep problems (like sleep apnea) affect insulin resistance and weight gain.

We speculate that a similar programme can be triggered in human microglia exposed to Aβ, LPS and other innate immune activators and disrupt brain homeostasis. Protein aggregates found in other neurodegenerative diseases may trigger the LDAM state. For example, alpha-synuclein binding to TLR2 and TLR5 induces microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is a shared signature seen in LDAM36. Given that we recently identified that LDAM are abundant in the ageing mouse brain, LDAMs may also be triggered by hitherto unknown protein aggregates and innate immune activators which accumulate with age. Interestingly, the most enriched pathway in human LD-containing iMGs is ‘cellular senescence’, similar to lipid-laden ‘foamy macrophages’ in atherosclerosis which have a senescent phenotype and are drivers of pathology37. Perhaps in the natural ageing of various organs, LD-accumulating tissue-resident macrophages represent a general class of senescent myeloid cells which are drivers of tissue inflammation. It could be a lot of things, and there might be multiple pathways that lead to this state. [1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07185-7#Sec6 reply lhuser123 8 hours agoparentprevPlausible.

You need to test and treat each individual hole to make sure it's not leaking. reply armadsen 10 hours agorootparentThis is good advice. Be aware that while APOE variants are the most well known and common causes of a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s, there are several others, including some 100% penetrance, dominant gene mutations that cause it.

Generally it would be common enough in your family (roughly 50% of people getting it), that you’d have reason to suspect one of these gene mutations. reply WalterBright 2 hours agorootparentprevEven if Dr Bredesen is misdiagnosing the causes of Alzheimer's, his recommendations are still just the basics of healthy living.

    "commentBody": "Causal 2.0 – Modern Financial Planning for Startups (causal.app)232 points by refrigerator 19 hours agohidepastfavorite57 comments refrigerator 18 hours agoHi everyone, I'm one of the Causal founders — we actually launched a super barebones MVP here on HN in 2019[1], back when we were still tinkering around on nights and weekends, and the reception + signups from that gave us the confidence to quit our jobs and go full-time on this, so thanks for the early support! The product has come a long way since that first HN launch. The best way to think about it is as a 'multidimensional spreadsheet' — instead of writing formulas that operate on single cells, Causal formulas operate on \"variables\" that span lots of cells (e.g. multiple 'months', or multiple 'products', or multiple 'countries'), so you can express any kind of model with 100–1000x fewer formulas. Lot of other important functionality like live data integrations, dashboards, etc. but the multi-dimensional modelling system is really the secret sauce :) Sounds super abstract, but the main use-case today is financial planning/reporting for early-stage companies, although some of our users have actually replaced their BI tools with Causal as well. Anyway, thanks for the support and keen to hear feedback :) 1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19704418 reply sksk 17 hours agoparentI am curious about your comment on 100-1000x fewer formulas. Is there a simpler example you can show how your product will do it relative to Excel? When I read your comment, I was thinking, SUM in Excel operates over many cells. You can have Arrays, etc. in Excel. So I am not sure how formulas work in your product that is fundamentally different. Is this like a function that I can define and call that function so it is easier? reply Lukas1994 16 hours agorootparentGreat question! Quite often in financial models, you're dealing with \"dimensions\" (e.g. your revenue is broken down by product, geography, and time). To model this in Excel you have to write complex SUMIF/INDEX/MATCH formulas. Then you have to drag these formulas over 1000s of cells (if you make a mistake you're screwed, see https://eusprig.org/research-info/horror-stories/). Causal's building blocks are \"variables\" and \"dimensions\" which makes it much more powerful to work with dimensional data. This video explains this in a more visual way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WELP2A5IzF4&ab_channel=Causa... reply sksk 14 hours agorootparentThank you. That makes sense. I totally agree, Excel is a nightmare to debug. reply localhost 11 hours agoparentprevFor your use case, what if you could use Python in Excel with pandas, numpy and the Anaconda ecosystem readily available? How would that change things? Disclosure: I was a founding member of the Python in Excel team and am looking for new problems that Python in Excel could solve. reply Lukas1994 10 hours agorootparentIMO this still doesn't change the fact that Excel is a 2D grid. Dealing with multi-dimensional data will always be tricky in that paradigm. Also, you'll still have cell references, no version control, no access control, ... Excel is an amazing product and I'm sure people will still use it in 10 years. Our thesis is that for financial planning (and various other number-crunching use-cases) our building blocks make more sense. reply dark_ph0enix 18 hours agoprevWe've had a number of very interesting technical challenges along the way to this 2.0 release: - traffic tiering and balancing based on request's perceived amount of work - low latency data loading during our calc loop - implementing a selector framework to unify all the stores used by the application - redesigning the formula editor to make human friendly yet expressive enough for the most hardcore user (fun UX challenge) We really ought to start blogging more about these things :D. reply no_wizard 10 hours agoparent>redesigning the formula editor to make human friendly yet expressive enough for the most hardcore user (fun UX challenge) I work in this space. I don't envy this. Been through it more than once. Did you also have challenges with circular references? reply obeavs 6 hours agorootparentWe've had \"fun\" solving this for Phosphor which has similar parts to Causal, but is focused more on real assets and emphasizes connection with computable contracts. For circularity, we found that we could keep the UX dynamic by making a deep copy of the circular part of the DAG behind the scenes, asking the user to determine which variable in that path should be \"resolved\", hard coding that variable in the copy, then solving that variable to zero through a newton optimization. Once optimized (in parallel to main graph), it feeds back into the main DAG just like any other dependency. Would be a silly approach in Excel, but not so much here. reply swyx 12 hours agoparentprevplease do! spin up an engineering blog on hashnode. https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/ reply Lukas1994 10 hours agorootparentWe have released a few bits actually! https://causal.app/blog/scaling is one of my favourites (HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32000400) reply rossjudson 5 hours agorootparentMachines like arrays, sequential access, avoiding conditions, and not touching memory unless you need to (compression == performance). Looks like you've traveled the enlightenment path to array languages! The first time I read Whitney's K language description was a singular mind-expanding moment. reply djbusby 9 hours agorootparentprevMore of this please. reply bryanmgreen 15 hours agoprevOne thing I have to really congratulate you on is your product video. I honestly think it's one of the best I've seen for any software. It showcases the functionality, displays the actual UI, doesn't rely on narration, is visually interesting, and succinct. Was it made internally or with an agency? reply pedalpete 11 hours agoparentAlong with an excellent use of music and pacing. Though it doesn't answer the \"is this product for me\" question, it does build excitement to make me want to learn more. reply refrigerator 15 hours agoparentprevAhh thanks, glad you liked it! We made it internally with the help of a video editor. reply killion 13 hours agorootparentThis does look really good. Do you mind if I ask which one you used? Thanks! reply refrigerator 12 hours agorootparentFeel free to drop me an email (taimur [at] causal [dot] app) and I'd be happy to introduce you to him :) reply zuhayeer 14 hours agoparentprevThe soundtrack actually goes so hard. Love it. reply parkaboy 17 hours agoprevVery excited by this and congratulations. I've been an avid causal user on the free plan at the early-stage startup I work for, and used it at my startup before that. It's been so great to see how the product has evolved. I can't overstate what a pleasure it has been to work with even when it was in its earliest stages. I would absolutely convert to paying if the jump to the next tier weren't so expensive ($250/mo), which has been really tough to digest right now. reply refrigerator 17 hours agoparentTotally get it — we know the $250 is too big a jump and we're currently trying to figure out the mechanics of a starter plan at $99/mo. In the meantime, we're pretty chill about offering $99 plans to early stage companies if you're under 10 people, or have raised under $500k. You can find the form for that on our pricing page under \"Startup programme\": https://causal.app/pricing Hope that helps, and thanks for the kind words and loyal support! reply toomuchtodo 11 hours agorootparentSame pricing for a non profit by chance? reply refrigerator 10 hours agorootparentYup we’ve done that a bunch - please fill in the form and we’d love to consider :) reply toomuchtodo 10 hours agorootparentAppreciate it! reply lharries 10 hours agoprevCongrats on the 2.0! If I remember right you started as a more general purpose excel competitor, how did you think about doubling down on the financial planning use case? reply loremchecksum 17 hours agoprevLooks great! I work in enterprise planning and wonder what is keeping you from targeting larger firms. Is the startup-target temporary or do you expect to let your clients \"scale out\" of the product? reply refrigerator 17 hours agoparentWe do actually have a bunch of bigger companies using Causal (incl. public companies) so it definitely works for bigger companies depending on exactly what they need. If they're looking for a great modelling tool with nice dashboards then I think we're perfect, if they're looking for something with more \"workflows\" type of stuff with lots of stakeholders who need to contribute to things, then we're less good. Because of this, we're focusing on smaller companies as a self-serve product for a while, and then gradually plan to build out that kind of enterprise stuff for bigger companies. There's also a lot more competition in the mid-market/enterprise in this space, and 0 competition for SMBs/self-serve, so we thought it would be good to lean in there :) reply ig1 15 hours agoparentprevIf you're looking for something more enterprise focused then https://www.pigment.com/ might be a good fit reply jgorn 6 hours agoprevUnderstand this is targetted at financial planning for startups/SMBs, but I'm curious as to if it could be adapted to work for personal financial planning (retirement wealth projections, modelling market downturns)? Curious if that's a use case you considered or a path the product may go down in the future reply durmanhoth 12 hours agoprevThere seem to be some synergies that you can leverage with spend management and expense management platforms (such as Brex, Ramp, etc.). Is this a fair assumption, and if so, have you considered exploring any opportunities in this area? Interesting stuff! reply refrigerator 10 hours agoparentWe’ve done some marketing partnerships with Ramp before, would be great to eventually get that data live in Causal! reply djbusby 9 hours agorootparentOr plug in a feed from SimpleFin? reply slinkypinky 16 hours agoprevCouple questions: 1. Where does the name come from? 2. I’ve seen a lot of startups with the business model of serving other startups. These remind me a lot of derivatives in the stock market in terms of the “risk” of their business model, and there have been instances of companies having to pivot when the economy goes down (i.e. Brex)… Do you have a contingency plan for this? reply refrigerator 16 hours agoparent1. It comes from the concept of 'causal inference' in statistics[1] — when we started out, we though the product would go in a much technical/statistical direction, but we were very wrong about that But 'causal' as a word is still relevant to modelling, etc. 2. Fair question haha. While a majority of our customers are startups/tech cos, a bunch of our customers are also non-tech small businesses (e.g. small agencies/consulting firms in various niches). Interestingly, we found that after the economy went down 18 months ago there seemed to be more demand for Causal from smaller companies (startups + regular SMBs) — our guess is that staying on top of finances is important when things are tough, and less important when there's tonnes of cash flying around! [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference reply slinkypinky 16 hours agorootparentInteresting, thanks. I’m pretty familiar with causal inference, so I’m curious — what direction did you think the product would head in? reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentThey're gonna make causal diagrams à la Judea Pearl, haha. reply seels 16 hours agoprevCongrats, Causal! I'm a fan and excited to see the 2.0 launch. A big part of our financial planning comes from manual syncing data from the tools we use for billing, expenses, and so on into our excel model — definitely going to try this out. reply refrigerator 16 hours agoparentAh nice, definitely sounds like something Causal can handle for you :) reply jtwaleson 14 hours agoprevFirst thing I noticed is that the UI looks exactly like Linear. Have seen more companies copy the same UI but not sure if it was actually Linear that started it. reply refrigerator 13 hours agoparentHaha, I think the evolution was something like this: 1. Slack introduces \"sidebar\" concept 2. Notion takes it a step further 3. Everyone starts doing sidebars, including Linear We took inspiration from Linear's 'search button in sidebar' and 'profile pic in sidebar', which I think were maybe their unique contributions to the tradition :) reply deathanatos 12 hours agorootparentReally, it's just a tab strip, no? (But with fixed heterogeneous tabs, as opposed to a set of homogeneous ones the user adds/removes from as they open/close docs.) Reminds me of the vertical tab strips in FF w/ TreeStyleTabs. Which reminds me of OS/2, where tab strips were on the side, with some nice skeuomorphism: https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/os2/history/os221/vxr... reply habitue 14 hours agoprevDo you offer monte carlo simulations for forecasting? reply refrigerator 14 hours agoparentYes! Causal natively supports Monte Carlo simulation. E.g. instead of writing \"7.5%\" in a cell, you can write \"5% to 10%\" and it will turn that into a distribution, and automatically run a few thousand samples with different values every time it re-calculates. Docs: https://docs.causal.app/formulas/values-with-uncertainty reply ttul 12 hours agorootparentThis alone makes me want to try Causal. I run my business with a gargantuan Google Sheet. It works - we nail our numbers. But scenario testing is very hard. reply refrigerator 12 hours agorootparentNice — definitely try Causal out! We have a 'scenarios' feature that lets you easily spin up \"discrete\" scenarios, and then you can use the Monte Carlo stuff to see continuous ranges of outcomes. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentThis reminds me a lot of calculators I use for FIRE, ie the ones shown here [0]. Perhaps I should try Causal for personal use as well as for business use. I've also seen Maybe [1] for personal finances, which looks good too.

Overall, it's cool to see lots of startups creating the next generation of spreadsheets: - Causal.app - Rows.com - Equals.com - Rowzero.io - and at least 50 others I've found reply refrigerator 18 hours agoparentThanks man! Messaging has been a long journey and I still think we're very far from cracking it haha reply 1oooqooq 13 hours agoprev [–] WOW! congrats! it's been ages I didn't see anyone actually manage to make a website that doesn't work with the non-dominant browser!

To quit use Ctrl+C Dump address 0100 (hex): D0100 Emulator running Wordstar under CP/M. What is an 8080? It is simply the little brother of the Zilog Z80, it has no extended registers (AF', BC', DE', HL', IX or IY), no relative jumps, and every instruction beginning with CB, DD, ED or FD doesn't exist. The flags are only S (Sign, bit 7), Z (Zero, bit 6), P (Parity, bit 2) and C (Carry, bit 0). The 8080 processor was created by Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima in 1974, afterwards both would design the Zilog Z80 in 1976, these two processors were pretty important and influential for the rise of microcomputers. Porting it It is easy if your platform has getch/kbhit and ANSI terminal read --> Z=kbhit()?getch():0 write --> putchar(7[o]) system --> nothing Also add the following to trap Ctrl-C: #includesignal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN); On PC/DOS you will need to add ANSI.SYS to CONFIG.SYS In *NIX the min 0 for stty is required, circa 2001 it was not required. How it works (SPOILER) The l array contains the 64K memory, it is initialized with a boot image loaded from the 'C' file, the program counter is the c pointer, and registers are on o[]. The main loops reads every op-code and separates it in one of three common forms, a lot of trinary operators selects the instruction. Execution starts at 0000, you can write your own boot or monitor program, or even your own operating system playing with the 'C' file. o[0] = B register o[1] = C register o[2] = D register o[3] = E register o[4] = H register o[5] = L register o[6] = Flags o[7] = A or accumulator The following instructions do peripheral operation: 76 Quits emulator DB 00 Reads key pressed status DB 01 Reads key DB 02 Reads byte from file (Carry=EOF) D3 xx Writes byte from acc. to console ED ED 02 Reads sector (128 bytes) ED ED 03 Writes sector (128 bytes) Memory addresses: FBFA = Low source/target address FBFB - High source/target address FBFC - Sector (0-127) FBFD - Cylinder (low byte) FBFE - Cylinder (high byte) FBFF - Drive (1/2) The BIOS is tailor made for this emulator and helps to simplify it. Though the size of each virtual hard disk drive can reach 1 GB, CP/M only handles up to 8 MB. Other notes: The 8080 runs at your computer speed divided between a number that I have not calculated. This obfuscated processor was created using obfuscated code produced by an obfuscated mind, no brains were harmed during its production, except those that tried to read the code. The original version of this code was eaten by my C++ dog. I intended to make it simple to understand, it uses only four C keywords. Also I discovered that braces are very useful for commenting. Why to bother with prototypes?, every good C programmer can develop its C programs using only one function. And now it is 2024 This emulator was developed eighteen years ago when the computers had 32-bit processors and it used a hole in the C language syntax where you could pass a pointer on an integer. In fact, this is the IOCCC objective: make C compilers to do things these shouldn't be supposed to do. However, the C compilers for 64-bit processors don't allow it anymore as pointers are 64-bit and the int types are 32-bit, so compilers stop with an error (in especial in macOS because clang). The source code in this webpage is already updated to use FILE * instead of int, and this way we brought CP/M to year 2024, hehe. If you are curious about it, the previous version of the emulator can be downloaded here or in the IOCCC website. In 2020, Mark Abene sent me a workaround for x86-64 computers: gcc -static toledo2.c -o toledo2 But this doesn't work in macOS. Useful links: Palo Alto Tiny BASIC source code, this is a modified version of the original. CP/M source code, the foundation of an operating system: monotask, no memory manager, only console and file services provided. Someone received an 8080 computer as a gift, dumped the ROM, and someone else found a way to test them with my 8080 emulator. :) Last modified: Feb/06/2024 Programming Games for Atari 2600!

    "commentBody": "Intel 8080 emulator. 19th IOCCC. Best of Show (nanochess.org)218 points by hggh 15 hours agohidepastfavorite48 comments billforsternz 6 hours agoOne of my best hacks back in the day was an 8080 emulator, for the 8088/8086 back in the time when what you were really trying to do was run the 8080 code as fast as possible (because the first PCs were slow, and emulating 8080 code was much slower than running 8080 code on a native machine). Invariably at the time the 8080 emulators would have a dispatch loop, fetching the next opcode and dispatching through a jump table to some code to emulate each of the 256 opcodes. One problem with this was that you couldn't dispatch this way without altering the CPU flags, so you'd also have to save and restore those with LAHF/SAHF (fast) or PUSHF/POPF (slow). In general you'd need about 10 8086 instructions to emulate 1 8080 instruction, and in the early 1980s this meant your emulated CP/M program would run much slower than on your old CP/M computer. My emulator would emulate 1 8080 opcode with 4 8086 opcodes as follows; An 8080 instruction, say 0x94 = sub h would be emulated with code loaded at address 0x9494. That code would be; sub bh,dl ;bh = bh-dl, emulate h with bh, a with dl lodsb ;al = *si++, get next opcode, increment emulated pc mov ah,al ;eg 0x94 -> 0x9494 jmp ax ;jump to next instruction This is a classic example of trading space for time, your emulator is sparsely distributed through 64K of RAM. So you needed 128K to emulate your 64K 8080. reply djmips 1 hour agoparentHow would full translation work? The opcodes are close? Could you do a just in time version? reply billforsternz 6 minutes agorootparentYes, pretty close so full translation is easy if you have the source code. If not, emulation is the normal way. My emulator was faster than native 8080 code on everything but vanilla 8088 PCs, so it's more than sufficient. I address translation in depth in my Retro Sargon project, an exercise in getting a vintage Z80 (8080 superset) assembly language program working on modern PCs. https://github.com/billforsternz/retro-sargon See the \"Yet More Details\" section in the README. reply aap_ 39 minutes agorootparentprevI think the 8086 was designed such that 8080 assembly code could be assembled as 8086 machine code. So I'd guess the instruction emulation would probably be reasonably efficient. reply tromp 14 hours agoprevSadly, the International Obfuscated C Code Contest has not been held in the past 3 years, the last one being the 27th IOCCC from 2020 [1].

The hints mention this, but the accepted secondary size for `cable3.c` was 1,977 tokens. (Later versions of `iocccsize` don't compute secondary sizes at all.)

To do this, we trained one of the best LLMs in the world, and created our first personal AI, Pi, which couples extraordinary EQ with industry leading IQ, and is now used by millions of people a week. As an AI studio we have long planned to make our technology available to developers and enterprises. And over the last year, we’ve heard countless times that people haven’t been able to replicate the unique conversational style of Pi with publicly available models, and would love to get access to our model and fine tuning infrastructure. There is a huge opportunity for Inflection here. Our plan going forward is to lean into our AI studio business, where custom generative AI models are crafted, tested and fine tuned for commercial customers. Our success at training, tailoring and improving the performance of large AI models makes us uniquely well placed to be the AI platform for businesses around the world. As part of this, we’re thrilled to announce that we will now host Inflection-2.5 on Microsoft Azure helping us get it into the hands of creators everywhere. We’ll also be ensuring it comes to other cloud hosting platforms in the near future. The API itself isn’t available today, but will be up and running very soon. To sign up for early access and help us test it, please register your interest here. Between API access and select high-level partnerships with great customers, our AIs can now spread to even larger new user bases while helping put cutting-edge AI capabilities in the hands of thousands of developers. This renewed emphasis on our API also comes with some important changes in the company. Today we are also announcing that two of our three co-founders, Mustafa and Karén, will be leaving Inflection to start Microsoft AI, a new division at Microsoft that will bring together their consumer AI efforts, as well as Copilot, Bing and Edge. We’re grateful for all their amazing work in getting Inflection to this stage, and wish them luck for this new chapter. We are delighted to welcome a new CEO, Sean White, who has decades of experience working at the cutting edge of technology, research and business. He is a visionary leader poised to take Inflection into this new era. Our third co-founder, Reid Hoffman will continue on our board and remains excited to take these next steps in building personal intelligence for everyone. We are hugely proud of what we’ve achieved with Pi. There will be no immediate changes to the service and we’re committed to ensuring that users get ongoing access to great AI experiences in the future.

They say their Inflection-2.5 model is the world's best personal AI[0] which is a dumb claim to make considering it is done off of automated benchmarks which we know are flawed and even if you assume automated benchmarks are good enough to claim that title, it would be held by dozens of other open weight models on HF, not Inflection-2.5. They said their Inflection-2 model was the second best in the world[1] while comparing it to Palm-2 which no one considers close to the best in the world. They again, based their claim on automated benchmarks which anyone knowledgeable in the space would know can be gamed and is not representative of actual conversational performance. (take a look at the Lmsys Arena Leaderboard for a better metric) They list other models they consider good while failing to mention or compare to Mixtral 8x7b, the best open model that exists.

You can safely guess that the vast majority of them are innocent ordinary people, but just not important enough to pause over on the path to grand prophetic dreams. Basically, from when he takes power again, he becomes a genocidal monster in charge of an army of murderous fanatics, and then he spreads this right across the empire, well beyond Arrakis itself where he already caused all kinds of chaos.

I went through my own story at Google, and seeing them say it was vaguely bad before promoting him to VP mirrors exactly the \"intervention\" I saw. The deck is completely stacked against you based on hierarchy. Behavior that a fast food manager would proactively solve in 30 seconds gets ignored in white collar tech. No one above you will even mention it - they know you can't win and they just hope you'll quietly give up. If someone above you in the informal hierarchy is messing with you, there's massive confirmation bias if you complain. They'll spin it to whoever you complain to make you the bad guy. HR never helps - their job is to investigate, and then give the results to someone 2-3 steps above you to do something with. The higher ups control the outcome, and they designed the power structure in the first place, their confirmation bias is accept the spin. If you want to survive, avoid conflict 100% of the time. Let people blame you, fail reviews undeservedly. My Google career ended from just doing exactly what I was supposed to do in order to get a 3 year delayed project done, that 4 separate VPs had been asking for all those years. I spent 6 months warning my manager fuckery was afoot. Didn't matter. TPM witnessed and defended me, didn't matter. Guy who led it hired his unqualified childhood buddy to replace me. Didn't matter. All on me. Everyone wanted to do it, and gee whillakers, refulgentis went mad and dropped the ball completely for some reason. Of course, 6 months later they delayed the project a 4th year because they could, documenting the only downside being a strained relationship with a less influential partner team. (my orgs managers didn't realize their...unvarnished...takes were in a doc shared with all of Google) At the end of the day, HR will funnel you into taking mental health leave -- 6 months worth, exactly long enough that an EEOC complaint can no longer be filed. (took me 6 years to realize why \"disgruntled Google employee\" news articles always included a bit referencing leave/6 months off as if it was a bad thing. go/mh-leave if you're at Google. You don't actually need to talk to HR, and I don't recommend going to them ever. I didn't for this, but they wouldn't have helped.)

Managers aren't allowed to just hire rando person. Did your director or VP not like you or something? I'm curious if there's more to this story. reply refulgentis 12 hours agorootparentThere always is, things that mattered here: Why didn't higher ups care? I didn't bother going up higher than skip. My core interlocutor was my skip's peer's report's report, I didn't expect my skip to go to war over slow-drip white collar bullying. Honestly, I was done and planning my exit once year 3.5 of \"not this year\" hit, going crying to VPs you see once a month / once a quarter felt insane & would have just devolved to he said/she said. To your point re: seems like a lot. I worked with a couple counselors at same level as my skip over my last year there. (highly recommend G2G if anyone reading is at Google, kept me sane.) #1 said they dealt with less after kissing their VP's wife at an off-site - which is why I got #2, wasn't sure if that one was too skeezy at first. What would I have done differently? I was honest the whole time, which didn't help because the fact I wasn't happy and it was escalating was clear. ex. with the hiring friend thing, told my manager that I was shocked and didn't expect that kind of thing at a startup. How do you hire a friend without domain experience as a manager? There's a core principle that once you've made it through Google interviews, domain doesn't matter, all Google SWEs will excel. Having loose rules with kind intent is awesome, but they're double-edged. That gives you rationale, and combined with moving recruiters into individual orgs., lets you put your thumb on the scale and bring in who you want.

What a lot of posts like this never mention is one of the primary uses of AI: to make more efficient the system of trying to get us to buy even more things we don't need. I mean, who are we kidding? In a well-balanced life, we shouldn't need or even interact with personal AIs. We should slow down and appreciate what we have and seek for simplicity. If there's too much data to be handled in business, it means business is not going in the right direction, not that we need new tools to handle it. If we are pressured to write more, then we are creating things not of true value but merely to amuse.

At least personally, I've found that giving up a fair amount of technology in many cases has actually improved life in ways that I didn't think possible.

My actual argument against LLMs is that: 1. They will replace so many jobs en masse that they will cause a large loss of meaning in many lives, that they will concentrate wealth in the hands of the tech companies, that they will enable even more efficient propaganda, and that they will be used as a drug to distract the populace from increasingly destructive practices enacted by global capitalism 2. LLMs will isolate us by providing more and more services that once were provided by humans. AI therapists, girlfriends/boyfriends, solvers of problems that we once turned to our fellow human being to solve. This vast increase in individual autonomy, pushed by psychological manipuluation to THINK that we need such autonomy, will destroy more local communities and connections that people have with each other. In conclusion we will become isolated and miserable, relying completely on the machine to keep our lives balanced without any autonomy to seek out our own way of doing things.

I'm not saying Satya isn't doing a great job, he really is, and I have many criticisms of Google's approach, but I do think Google is at least equally well positioned, and possibly better positioned. reply CuriouslyC 14 hours agorootparentI agree that TPUs are a huge competitive edge. That and huggingface integration is going to let google do very well serving open models until other competitive hardware comes online. The problem is that I think the window to capitalize on TPUs isn't going to be long enough to cement any sort of dominance, and they're fumbling so badly now that I don't have faith in the leadership. reply feyman_r 10 hours agorootparentprevOutlook is a part of Office. Also, I’m not sure ‘vertical integration’ is the only way to succeed at business. Google is trying to do that here - with a fast-changing landscape, one would want to use the best downstream provider. reply Aerbil313 9 hours agorootparentprevSurely the others have ties with Pentagon too.

No. Is it the absolute worse it can be? Also no. Internship or apprenticeship instead of tech interviews are just take home tests that last multiple months, and that is a huge waste of time. Yes, broken interview system currently rewards people who interview more, but when you combine it with other signals like resume, project presentations and other things, the chances of hiring bad candidates are low. Yes, you miss out on a lot of great candidates, but that is not a problem that big tech companies need to solve. Besides, not knowing the status of your employment 3-6 months down the line is not a great thing for candidates. reply Analog24 16 hours agoparent [–] Internships are definitely not a waste of time. First of all, they pay well in and of themselves (at least in tech). Second of all, most internships are filled by students on their summer break. What better use of that time than getting an inside view of a company they might want to work for? From the companies perspective it gives them a much better idea of how well the candidate performs and how they fit in at the company, giving much higher confidence in a hiring decision that could lead to significant future impact. reply darth_avocado 16 hours agorootparent [–] I think you misunderstood. Internships for students during the summer definitely makes sense. However, i was talking about internships/probation as a way to evaluate candidates instead of interviews. Meaning if you are a staff engineer with 10+ years of experience, you’re still going to be hired conditionally for 3-6 months to see if you’re good enough for the team. I personally find that very prone to abuse. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The programming style was “data munged by imperatives with loops” (sound familiar?). An interesting wrinkle was that the machines we used at that time (and most computers) did not have what would be called an “operating system” — but there were yearnings, and also interesting subsets of code that helped “operators” run “jobs”. In just a few years, as the result of many different forces, a number of different operating systems started to appear, and most of them had as one of their main goals to be able to run multiple processes, including processes written by different people for different reasons. Big shifts in outlook started to happen, and many of them were ultimately about “trust” and “security” in “evermore complex systems of processes”. The history of this is really interesting — including that some of the best solutions were done very early in the game (some of these never got generally recognized by the run of the mill programming establishments). In order to get to the answer of the question, I’ll only urge readers to look into this “epistemological revolution that was generally missed by the field”. Let me use *trust* as the central theme for this question and answer. *Trust* was certainly part of the criteria for a program before the days of multiprogramming, but it was basically whether a running single program could be trusted to do what it was supposed to do. Bugs were there, but only affected the program that had them — in rare cases, bugs could be propagated via “wrong data” written on tapes, etc., but in practice, almost all bugs were local, so the integrity of a program was quite a bit easier to ascertain and improve. When the desire for multiprogramming happened, it was attempted on hardware that could not confine the different processes (sometimes an entire core memory image (usually less than 150KB) was rolled in and out for each job to and from a drum or even tape memory). This led to some hardware assists of various kinds, and attempts to have the cake and also eat it. The bottom line today is that most computations are not as secure and trustworthy as they need to be (in part because some of the best solutions wound up being perceived as being “too expensive” and then abandoned). Note that *Trust* becomes front and center as Moore’s Law advances, especially with advanced networking. Note that *Trust* becomes IMO the *dominant issue* when all that has gone before is added to “NCANIP”s (non cognitive artificial non-intelligent processes* are allowed to run wild in forms that as Harari has pointed out “hack the language communications systems of our species”. Note that “Trust” is one of the deepest issues — much larger than “just computing” — when not just communication, but actual education is one of the main needs and goals. We want to be able to know the degree of trust we can allow for what our own minds come up with, what we hear from others, what we read, our teachers, etc. A big deal with science is that it was partially invented by humans — after hundreds of thousands of years — by learning better methods than trusting one’s senses, or mere beliefs of one’s cultures. A simple principle is that for most things that are automated and scaled, the *trust requirements* have to be vastly expanded and made vastly more strict. Finally, to try to answer the question … (Summary: I don’t think it would be a good idea at all) First, I don’t think the way programming is generally taught (as I’ve seen it in a number of major universities) is a good approach (and hasn’t been for about 60 years now). Qualitative changes of many kinds have obsoleted the general approaches, the languages, the operating systems, the infrastructures, *and* the ability to *trust* what can be found online — Etc etc. Second, the genii has been out of the bottle for much of the Moore’s Law expansions, and this creates critical questions — as with most infrastructure issues — of how much effort should be expended to keep patching the problems vs actually addressing them with better more secure, more trusted, and *more system* approaches. (Putting typical businesses in charge of these tradeoffs has been an unmitigated disaster — but we can see that savvy and wisdom in government is not up to the task either — still, something like government will be required.) (Note, it used to be part of the job of universities to not just teach/help-learn ideas, but to be both “keepers of the flame” and the vanguard for “reinventing better fire”. (Claim/guess: most so-called “computer science” departments in universities today do neither — they seem to now be trade-schools for what existing businesses/organizations have gotten themselves into trouble with.)) Third, I like to praise the (actual) Internet design because (a) it was really done well, and (b) I was not involved enough in it to claim any credit (thus, my praise should be more “trustworthy”!). A key part of their design was to *not allow direct sending of commands* — only bits could be sent. This means that (other) software inside each physical computer has the responsibility to *interpret* the bits, and the power to *do* (or not do) *some action* (note that this and other ideas of the Internet suggest ways to organize software processes, etc.). Fourth, I do think that an expert system could be made to *help* teach programming much better than a book can, and better than most teachers of programming do now, so that most learners can *actually learn* much better than they do now. By “learn” I mean that important processes and relationships are created between the learner’s ears by their own brain. By “help” I mean that — especially when *changes in epistemological points of view from one’s own common sense are required* , it can make a huge difference to be near a “special human” whose personality is strong enough to make us rethink what we think we know. Our “trust” in this person is not necessarily that they are “right” all the time, but that “they are consistently interesting, and thus worth listening to”. Occasionally, we can have that kind of trust in an author, but it is often all too easy to be lazy about rethinking … Fifth, I think ML and LLMs, etc., do have a part in “actual machine intelligence” in the future, but not nearly the most important parts. I don’t think the systems exhibited today are to be trusted at all (and note that using such a system to provide explanations for what another such system has concluded, is just piling BS on BS). That humans also do this all the time is “interesting”, “dangerous” etc., but it is also why trying to move from *superstition* (this is actually what “reasoning by correlation” amounts to) to more scientific methods is critical for anything like civilization to be created. Finally, I think the big deal here is vastly larger than the vast disasters in computing systems at all levels. If we look at human anthropology, we see a species that treats solitary confinement and banishment from society as punishments — we are a society because we can cooperate and trust a little — but when are safely back in society, we start competing like mad (and cheating like mad) as though the society is there to be strip-mined. Scaling and technique has made this a “Spaceship Earth” issue that can no longer be put off and ignored and violated.

P.S. by accident, and thanks to Richard Strachan, I found the below from Kurt Vonnegut right after writing the above (to me this is priceless!): In 2006 a high school English teacher asked students to write a famous author and ask for advice. Kurt Vonnegut was the only one to respond - and his response is magnificent: “Dear Xavier High School, and Ms. Lockwood, and Messrs Perin, McFeely, Batten, Maurer and Congiusta: I thank you for your friendly letters. You sure know how to cheer up a really old geezer (84) in his sunset years. I don’t make public appearances any more because I now resemble nothing so much as an iguana. What I had to say to you, moreover, would not take long, to wit: Practice any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry, fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience becoming, to find out what’s inside you, to make your soul grow. Seriously! I mean starting right now, do art and do it for the rest of your lives. Draw a funny or nice picture of Ms. Lockwood, and give it to her. Dance home after school, and sing in the shower and on and on. Make a face in your mashed potatoes. Pretend you’re Count Dracula. Here’s an assignment for tonight, and I hope Ms. Lockwood will flunk you if you don’t do it: Write a six line poem, about anything, but rhymed. No fair tennis without a net. Make it as good as you possibly can. But don’t tell anybody what you’re doing. Don’t show it or recite it to anybody, not even your girlfriend or parents or whatever, or Ms. Lockwood. OK? Tear it up into teeny-weeny pieces, and discard them into widely separated trash receptacles. You will find that you have already been gloriously rewarded for your poem. You have experienced becoming, learned a lot more about what’s inside you, and you have made your soul grow.

Sometimes this would be just classical piano for many days and even months. I mostly did this by getting up really early in the morning to have the freshness, time, and solitude needed for the 2–3 hours a day I spent. (It was quite difficult.) The basic idea of fluency is to put enough time and focus into the learning process to have the new things “become you” as “you become them”. Part of the result is a different and fleshed out “intuition” about what you are trying to do to go along with the many skills needed. I was helped by having learned other instruments (jazz guitar) fluently when I was a teenager. This did not help with the mechanics at all, but did help with having a feeling for music, how it is written, what it means to play it, etc. There was no question that many parts of this learning were much more difficult to internalize than when I was a kid. Another perspective is that I’ve worked with many intelligent busy adults over the years, both in corporate and educational type settings, and have found that most of them, even with considerable desire, have not been able to put enough sustained will together to fit a really new big thing into their adult learning curve (I in fact was quite desperate about this for many years before I just did it). However, in an earlier period of my life I also taught guitar to a wide range of students, including adults. The adults had a real advantage over the kids by having much more perspective about themselves and their processes — they could decide to practice, and would practice. They were generally much more limited than the kids via how long it took to learn physical things, and their biggest barrier was often having a much stronger idea of a goal (which was almost always to be able to play a favorite song or two like one of their musical heroes). So it was hard for them to be happy with stuff that wasn’t their target. I spent quite a bit of time making simpler versions of their target so they could feel they “were on their goal”. The kids on the other hand learned more easily but usually had real problems with practicing. The ones that didn’t have these problems just soared. A lot of the consulting and advisory boards etc. I’ve done and been on over the years have been for corporations, and two of the main problems are that (a) the higher-level executives don’t understand computing, and (b) the employees who “do computing” don’t understand computing. Both are really difficult to teach for the reasons above, and the additional difficulties of “(b)” of having gotten fluent in a weak version of the pursuit. Since humans are terrible at forgetting, new learning has to go over what is already there, and there can be deep conflicts and frustrations. And given this, it should be obvious that the “(a)” people have also learned things that will make learning some of the new things more difficult than they would be for a child. Still, a big plus — and the military has this also — is that if the corporation is interested in having its employees — especially the higher-level ones — learn about computing, then by fiat it can make the time available during the day as part of the jobs (and salary) of the learners. Quite a bit of time will still be required, but under these conditions quite a bit can be done, and perhaps rather analogous to what it would mean to have the goal to get fluent in a foreign language. And, in fact, there are examples of this in corporate history. My favorite, and I got to watch the process firsthand while being on the corporate advisory board, was the computer/systems-design training regime of the 32,000 employees of Andersen Consulting in the mid-80s. They were extremely serious about how they went about things, so they had bought a 4000 bed university (formerly a Catholic institution) in St. Charles, Illinois and used it to train their “Arthurs” in many things, and most especially in “Method/1” which was the strategy and tactics of design and implementation for their engagements as consultants with their clients. Pretty much every “Arthur” spent at least two weeks each year at St Charles, and in their earlier years, spent much longer. All of this plus exploratory research was done by the Technical Services Organization (run while I was there by the amazing Mel Bergstein). This was essentially “plug compatible commando training” and was tremendously successful. It missed much of what was really powerful about computing, but it was very compatible with their clients, and thus made a large and successful business. If it were music, it was about marching, playing marches, and composing marches. The TSO people were much more adventurous about the larger scopes and powers of computing, and part of the process I was involved with was to see what could be done about the larger issues of computing, especially give the resource of St Charles. (This also eventually involved getting the inimitable Roger Schank to bring his whole sub-department at Yale to Northwestern to help shape the new experiences (a different story for a different time)). One of the most interesting groups within TSO was the “object-oriented design” team that was based in New York. I think there were 30 or perhaps 40 of them, and this group had gotten very good at understanding *real* object-oriented design and implementation. This took them about 3 years, and they were supported and sheltered by Bergstein. (Another great story for another time was how all of this paid off with the still amazing Brooklyn Union Gas design and implementation during the late 80s.) I think it is much easier for a group of people to learn good versions of “real computing” together, and they can if they are given the time and the support by their company. The most critical parts of the process are how to introduce the really important things that need to be learned that will seem to be “off task” by both the company and the learners (this is because most “normal” corporate computing could hardly have a worse process or ideas about making systems). So, as usual, learning something new and important is almost always going against “normal” (which if you think about it in regular society, means “doing something crazy”). This is the biggest hurdle for improving computing in corporate organizations. 999 121 9 7 9 2 Mark Miller Academic wanderer, writer, aspiring computer scientist · Author has 3.4K answers and 5.9M answer views · 6y Related How can I learn Alan Kay's ideas?

Some of it gets repetitive, because usually when he’s gone out to speak, he’s toured with a theme for a while, but most of the time he reveals something a little different about his thinking in each one. It’s hardly ever quite the same presentation twice. I think the most important thing to get (it’s the essential thing he’s tried to spread interest in) is what he calls “outlooks,” and secondly, an interest in gaining knowledge that is created out of those outlooks. This is really something where you have to do the legwork yourself to gain. He’s pointed people like myself in some directions, but we have to do the work of understanding the material. The Viewpoints material requires some background knowledge to understand, which I think could likely be gained by following a trail that starts with the footnotes in their annual progress reports, and otherwise, in their papers. Kay published a reading list (resources : books : reading list ) some years ago. He’s since said that he came up with it because Accenture requested it, and it is by no means meant to be a “complete canon” of any sort. He’s said he knows of many more books that are worth reading that he hasn’t mentioned (though he’s talked about a few more here on Quora). There’s also a bibliography of stuff he’s written (Alan Kay Media Center ). I’ve felt for many years that Kay’s ideas need a “bridge” from the perspective that many people in IT and CS have, because my own experience is that since he comes from such a different perspective, his message is often misunderstood, or seen as a bridge too far. What he would say is that those who are unfamiliar with his perspective look at things from a weaker outlook, whereas he looks at things from more powerful ones. One of my goals has been to help people who are interested to make that transition from the weaker outlooks to the stronger ones. My own experience is that once you start understanding that, then you start understanding his ideas much more clearly. I’ve been on this journey myself, which I’ve written about on my blog (Tekkie ). I started into it in 2006, coming out of working in IT services for several years. I’ve left behind what I’ve called “Bread crumbs ” on my blog, which has been my thought process on trying to reach this perspective. I’ve thought it might be valuable to others, because I reached it in stages. They may be necessary for others as well. 99 16 9 1 Promoted by Betterbuck Anthony Madden Writer for Betterbuck · Updated Mar 1 What are a few of the dumbest mistakes people make on the internet right now?

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more). They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice. Here’s a link to Total Adblock , if you’re interested. 2. Overspending when online shopping. You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere. Big stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices. I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have Capital One Shopping installed yet, do yourself a favor and grab it . When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will: Auto-apply coupon codes for you to save you money Compare prices from other sellers to make sure you’re not missing out on a better deal It’s saved me a ton of money more than once.

Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping , if you're interested. 3. Overspending on auto insurance. Believe it or not, the average American family still overspends by $417/year on car insurance. Here’s how to quickly see how much you’re being overcharged (takes maybe 30 seconds): Pull up Coverage – it’s a free site that will compare prices for you Answer the questions on the page It’ll spit out a bunch of insurance quotes for you. That’s literally it. You’ll likely save yourself a bunch of money. Here’s a link to Coverage. 4. Not dealing with credit card debt. Debt can make you feel hopeless—even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt. But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (Accredited Debt Relief , for example) are willing to help you pay off your debt. Here’s how it typically works: You typically need $20k+ in overall debt. A company like Accredited Debt Relief (there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks etc. to try and reduce your debt. If possible, they’ll consolidate all of your different sources of debt so you only have to make one monthly payment to one place. A lot of times you’ll end up paying significantly less than you owe. Here’s an example from Accredited’s site: E.g. he was $80k in debt, but only ended up paying $50kish. If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so. Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate , if you’re interested. 5. Not getting a financial advisor. 99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake. Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time. People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year (according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time. But more important: a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of. If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like WiserAdvisor ) and find somebody near you that has good reviews. Or if you want something easier, here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs. 6. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20). It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some). Times have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (Ark7 is one of our favorites). They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account. It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate). If you’re interested, take a look at Ark7’s properties here . 7. Giving away your opinions for free. As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well). I usually use Survey Junkie (link here ). You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc. Perfect for when you're watching TV. Here's the form I used to sign up - I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops. So there you have it, the dumbest mistakes people make online. Don't be one of those people!

(quora.com)175 points by agomez314 16 hours agohidepastfavorite136 comments ozten 14 hours ago> That humans also do this all the time is “interesting”, “dangerous” etc., but it is also why trying to move from superstition (this is actually what “reasoning by correlation” amounts to) to more scientific methods is critical for anything like civilization to be created. \"reasoning by correlation\" as superstition is a brutal insight. reply kergonath 13 hours agoparent> \"reasoning by correlation\" as superstition is a brutal insight. I don’t think he is right on that one, though. Reasoning by correlation is a kind of empiricism, and it can be tested. “These things happen together” or “if I do this, then that happens” can be disproven with statistical analysis even without any understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play their causes. Superstition is beyond that; it is a belief that cannot be proven and that is not based on logic. The problem with superstition is not that there is no causal link between the supposed cause and the effect, it’s that there is not even a correlation. reply atoav 12 hours agorootparentThe problem here is that correlation is not a hard term for the people doing drawing the lines. People who take homeopathics for example will assure you they always get healthy when they took the sugar pills. What they fail to see is that they would have gotten healthy without it as well. If you always rub your lucky penny before playing a sports game a superstitious person would account wins for the penny and excuse losses by not having rubbed the penny enough, the right way, not concentrated enough. This also feeds into correlation. We are not talking about things actually being correlated, we are talking about people believing they are. Those are two wildly different things one is physical reality and doesn't change when you ignore it, the other is bound to individuals and tbeir world view and can take on absolutely ridiculous forms. reply Phiwise_ 12 hours agorootparentprevA road trip by random walk is also a kind of empiricism that can be tested. This does not imply it is worth the energy to actually do. reply sfpotter 11 hours agorootparentA road trip by random walk is a valuable experience, the kind most people on HN lack. reply Phiwise_ 11 hours agorootparentCall me crazy, but I don't think the goal of AI should be to give the rock with electricity in it \"a valuable experience\". reply sfpotter 10 hours agorootparentWhat are you even talking about? reply Phiwise_ 9 hours agorootparentThe right way to build AI. You know, the topic of this thread. I've been wondering what you're talking about, though. reply halayli 13 hours agorootparentprevSuperstition is assuming a causation when you identify a correlation. reply brookst 12 hours agorootparentOften followed by applying confirmation bias to see correlations when there are none. reply bsaul 10 hours agorootparenti think this is the part of superstition. Reproductive, effective, correlation is the start of a scientific path to true discoveries. Superstition only begins when the correlation has never truly never been observed, but only repeated from generations to generations without any other kind of justification other than \"that's what i heard\". reply n4r9 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are plenty of superstitions that are perfectly falsifiable. People continue to believe in them for comfort. For example, wearing odd socks to a sports match helps your team win. Or, leaving a fan on overnight might kill you. reply alexvoda 12 hours agorootparentprevI think the author and you are using different meanings for \"reasoning\". We do know that many people even in professional fields confuse correlation with causation. And even when that doesn't happen, when only doing measurments, correlation is often considered good enough without giving any thought to the underlying mechanism. This may be the root of Goodhart's law stating that when a measure becomes a target it stops being a good measure. The measure was only correlated with the behaviour the person doing the measuring thought was measuring. Superstition is similar, but drops any shred of statistical rigour, relying on mere anecdotal evidence. reply ein0p 12 hours agoparentprevIt’s great that he recognizes that most people aren’t to be trusted either. Most people outside the field are talking about “safety” as though humans never lie or make up bullshit, whereas in reality I trust GPT4 much more than I’d trust an average human, just not 100%. Literally people keep hyperventilating about “fake news” generation even though their entire news consumption already consists solely of pre approved narratives, many of which are fake, by omission or otherwise. I can’t wait for the day when ultra long context LLMs are able to point out omissions and factual contradictions in human produced fake news for any given event reply ribosometronome 11 hours agorootparentAre context windows not long enough to do this for most news articles and forum posts nowadays? I'd've thought the issue would be finding the relevant and reliable sources of truth for comparison would be the difficult part. reply ein0p 11 hours agorootparentThat is difficult, yes. The way the game is played is a handful of large outlets promote themselves as “trusted” and then drown out everything else as “untrustworthy”. But the fly in the ointment for them is that even these large/sophisticated opinion manipulators (they shouldn’t be called news sources at this point) are inconsistent both over time and sometimes also in the moment. Today’s public short attention span prevents it from seeing such inconsistencies or from paying attention to the broader picture. But guess what today’s models easily outperform humans on? The ability to pay attention to more than a small handful of things for longer than a few minutes. reply kurthr 13 hours agoparentprevIt seems like the other part of this is the ability of LLMs to rationalize even answers that are not rational (he says piling BS on BS). That has previously been a very human (and quite distracting/confusing) activity and it's very effective on most people most of the time. reply discreteevent 11 hours agoparentprevHere's an excellent recent comment along the same lines (in response to whether our intelligence is statistically based like LLMs): > mjburgess 9 days ago Suppose you touch a fireplace once, do you touch it again? No. OK, here's something much stranger. Suppose you see your friend touch the fireplace, he recoils in pain. Do you touch it? No. Hmm... whence statistics? There is no frequency association here, in either case. And in the second, even no experience of the fireplace. The entire history of science is supposed to be about the failure of statistics to produce explanations. It is a great sin that we have allowed pseudosciences to flourish in which this lesson isnt even understood; and worse, to allow statistical showmen with their magic lanterns to preach on the scientific method. To a point where it seems, almost, science as an ideal has been completely lost. The entire point was to throw away entirely our reliance on frequency and association -- this is ancient superstition. And instead, to explain the world by necessary mechanisms born of causal properties which interact in complex ways that can never uniquely reveal themselves by direct measurement. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39661963 reply codethatwerks 12 hours agoparentprevCausation is just correlation, and a good story. :-) reply skadamat 15 hours agoprevThis answer is amazing and classically Alan Kay! There's so much here to unpack because of all the different areas Alan draws from in his work (he's like a computing philosopher). All I will say is that for people who want to understand his perspective, there's a large epistemological load to overcome. Sampling his talks is a good starting point though: https://tinlizzie.org/IA/index.php/Talks_by_Alan_Kay reply layer8 15 hours agoparentHe always criticizes how everyone got computing wrong (fair enough), but never offers anything but the most vague suggestions of how to do things differently. reply Osmose 13 hours agorootparentHe has generally great insights about principles to aim for, which is part of the answer, but no, he does not have the entire answer. His insights are inspiration for others who contribute their own parts to potential answers—that's how open collaboration works. reply joshmarinacci 14 hours agorootparentprevHis entire 60 year career is a suggestion of how to do things differently. ;) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay reply sebastianconcpt 15 hours agorootparentprevHe did tho. He mentioned more than once that OOP was more about message passing than behavior + state. reply layer8 14 hours agorootparentYes, that’s what I mean by vague suggestions. How do you actually build and maintain a system of any complexity with that? How do you ensure it will do what it is supposed to do? And Smalltalk wasn’t that, it is mostly just regular method calls and not “message passing”. reply chongli 14 hours agorootparentHe’s not just a proponent of message passing, he’s a proponent of late binding [1]. The idea there is to have a running image of the environment and interact with it in real time, updating code while it’s running (no recompiling or anything like that). The idea is a high level of interactivity with very tight feedback loops. A whole operating system like this would allow you to hack on the user interface and change things on the fly. All of your software would also work like this, promoting open extensibility by the user. You ought to be able to click on any window or other user interface element and be able to view and modify the running code live, without even restarting the computation it’s running (never mind the whole program or even rebooting the computer). This sort of ability to do live hacking on the internals of what you’re working with is how computers used to work in those early days. It’s also how machinery has always worked in the past. A mechanic could lock in the timing of an engine by rotating the distributor cap and listening to how smoothly it fires. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentThe closest I’ve seen to this is programming in Excel - each step is visible to you and you can tweak it in the cell itself and see what it does. reply satellite2 14 hours agorootparentprevA browser kind of fit the requirements. reply Phiwise_ 10 hours agorootparentKay himself does regularly describe the Arpanet as one of the inspurations for OO, and the modern interbet browser as an incomplete implementation of the same ideas: https://youtu.be/1e8VZlPBx_0 reply yourapostasy 13 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if all of that was in an operating system as described but backed by Nix so we accomplish the NixOS-style reproducibility and configuration time travel, what the developer experience and user experience would be like. Instead of binary blob images, we'd have Nix declaratives and flakes we dissect at will, without fear of wedging the system with the live modifications we make. Our hardware is sufficiently capable enough these days that I'm curious if we can do this to conventional Smalltalk and Common Lisp system/machine designs to re-imagine them, and bring back a level of tight feedback looped developer experience that has gone underground in the mainstream. reply yourapostasy 14 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if all of that was in an operating system as described but backed by Nix so we accomplish the NixOS-style reproducibility and configuration time travel, what the developer experience and user experience would be like. Instead of binary blob images, we'd have Nix declaratives and flakes we dissect at will, without fear of wedging the system with the live modifications we make. reply projektfu 13 hours agorootparentprevI disagree, not because methods do not get called, but because the Smalltalk sender is not calling a method, it is sending a message. It says to the runtime, here is an object and I want to send \"#collect:\" to it using this other object obj as a parameter. The runtime looks in the object's class for a method called \"collect:\" and, if found, calls the method with the receiver and obj. If not found, it will look in the superclasses until it cannot find it, then it will send \"#doesNotUnderstand:\" with the context, and go up the class hierarchy again. Because of the message-passing paradigm, the receiver can make behaviors that are unusual, such as proxying and delegation, in a more or less transparent fashion. If the sender is calling a method, then that is a static arrangement and the result is not different from a function call. reply vanviegen 12 hours agorootparentHow does what you're describing differ from polymorphism, or from doing OOP in loosely typed languages like javascript? reply fzzzy 10 hours agorootparentEvery single object in smalltalk is free to have its own implementation of handling a message. In javascript, the runtime decides for the object how to locate the code and how to call it. reply Phiwise_ 12 hours agorootparentprevDoes a full free operating system, all the way down to the metal, and hypermedia publishing suite in 936kB count as \"a system of any complexity\" that \"will do what it is supposed to do\" to you? If not, what specifically is your standard? https://youtu.be/BUud1gcbS9k reply joshmarinacci 14 hours agorootparentprevSmalltalk is definitely message passing. There are many ways to intercept the messages and implement different responses. This one mechanism enables: network aware code, object proxies, sub-classing, on-the-fly code generation, and lots of other behavior. Traditional methods were invented later as less robust version of Smalltalk's message passing. reply Xelynega 14 hours agorootparentprevErlang(and more modernly elixir/Gleam) are an example of this in practice, and were created to make it easier to ensure the working and manage the complexity of large systems. reply layer8 14 hours agorootparentFair enough. But Alan Kay doesn’t say “use Erlang”, nor does he go into any depths about what the desirable feature set is and what would make it work or would fail to make it work. He’s always just waxing around nebulous desiderata and complaining about the status quo. reply Phiwise_ 13 hours agorootparent>But Alan Kay doesn’t say “use Erlang”, nor does he go into any depths about what the desirable feature set is and what would make it work or would fail to make it work. Oh yeah? Then how do you explain this lecture where he says explicitly that Erlang should be the modern programmer's assembly? https://youtu.be/fhOHn9TClXY In my experience, people who criticize Kay for being too vague or kvetching too pointlessly or lacking practical experience in computer science today almost always have not bothered to familiarize themselves with the vast majority of his work before deciding their opinion on it. It's hard to disagree with him that this makes us more like a pop culture than a profession after seeing it. reply alexvoda 12 hours agorootparentYou hit the nail head on. The field of IT is a pop culture and consequently just as prone to fads and periodic fashions. reply Phiwise_ 12 hours agorootparentIf only. Unix would be dead and buried many years ago if it was just a fad. It's far more like the old repeating fertility rituals of many paganistic societies, where your neighbors burn your pagus down to cleanse the village of the spite of the undead grain god if you plowed your heath in a different direction from everyone else. reply sebastianconcpt 11 hours agorootparentprevJust adding here that the understanding of the forces at play in a cultural war makes what you just said even more clear and for a vast spectrum of fields way beyond IT. reply jhbadger 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's somewhat of a backhanded compliment though -- calling Erlang a \"modern assembly\" is like the quip that C is a \"portable assembler\" -- that is, a tool useful for low-level stuff but which you should mostly use to implement higher level languages on top of. reply Phiwise_ 9 hours agorootparentI don't agree with this in the context of the full video. I'd encourage you to watch it; it's quite good. It's clear Armstrong and Kay have a great deal of respect for each other. reply pests 13 hours agorootparentprev> He’s always just waxing around nebulous desiderata and complaining about the status quo. How is inventing Smalltalk and putting his ideas into reality just \"waxing around\" or \"complaining\"? reply asdajksah2123 14 hours agorootparentprevIf he said \"use Erlang\" then that eliminates the actual message he's trying to convey, which is message passing is good. I bet if he simply said \"use Erlang\", 99% of headlines and discussion would be \"Alan Kay said Erlang is the greatest language evah!\" I do appreciate that he respects his audience, ie me, enough that he thinks we can read \"message passing is good\" and go from there to choosing a message passing language that is suitable for our needs, or even using a non message passing language due to other factors, but recognizing that OOP is about message passing and not state encapsulation, which would impact how I code even in Java. reply MisterTea 14 hours agorootparentprevMaybe because there is no one/right/simple answer. You really have to think for yourself and seek out answers instead of expecting them. You're doing that now but with the mistaken impression you were to be handed them. reply hintymad 14 hours agorootparentprevSmallTalk? Even though the language is mainstream, its many ideas, including implementation and design style using message passing, are embedded in many languages and software packages. reply the_af 13 hours agorootparentprev> Yes, that’s what I mean by vague suggestions. How do you actually build and maintain a system of any complexity with that? Reminds me of the RESTful guy, Roy Fielding (though I respect and like Alan Kay way more). If you've read any of his online interactions, apparently nobody does REST like he envisioned. It simply doesn't exist in the wild. When asked about some REST API, he'll claim it's not RESTful, it's wrong, that's not what he meant, etc. \"But what would be right?\", you ask, and he'll reply \"Read my paper! HATEOAS! (Hypermedia as the engine of application state)\". \"Ok, but what does it mean in practice, how do I go about building an API with HATEOAS?\"... ...and there's no answer for that besides \"read my dissertation\". He can only tell you what you're doing wrong, but nobody has been able to build a \"true\" RESTful API to Roy Fielding's satisfaction. reply cxr 12 hours agorootparent> the RESTful guy, Roy Fielding I think you're confused about who Fielding is and what REST is about. His writing isn't about building \"true\" RESTful APIs. It isn't really about APIs per se at all, RESTful or not. (Further, Fielding to my knowledge isn't even known for his use of the word \"RESTful\".) It sounds like you've probably been misled by a bunch of people who aren't Fielding about what's in his dissertation. Not unreasonable in those circumstances that one be told to actually read the thing instead of guessing at the gestalt of it based on ambient chatter which is by and large very misinformed. Having said that, Fielding's writing is not something I would exalt for its clarity. I'm partial to jcrites's explanatory powers: \"REST describes how the Web works\"reply fzzzy 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's incredibly easy to build hypermedia as the engine of application state sites. You generate html pages with state in them, and hyperlinks and forms that filter and change the state. Hateoas didn't invent anything. He literally just described how web 1.0 worked. reply fmap 13 hours agorootparentprevOthers have already mentioned this, but Alan Kay spent his entire career experimenting with approaches to radically simplify computing. The progress reports from vpri give a good overview of a recent project that has since wrapped up, e.g.: https://tinlizzie.org/VPRIPapers/tr2012001_steps.pdf reply YeGoblynQueenne 13 hours agorootparent>> Others have already mentioned this, but Alan Kay spent his entire career experimenting with approaches to radically simplify computing. Yes. And yet, he created OOP [1]. Strange. ________________ [1] Not on his own. reply jdlshore 12 hours agorootparentYou’re saying this like it’s a “gotcha,” which makes me believe you’re confusing OOP-as-practiced-in-enterprise with OOP-as-invented-by-Kay. The sad truth is that most great ideas are doomed to drown in a sea of mediocrity and misinterpretation. reply YeGoblynQueenne 10 hours agorootparentI'm not confusing anything. OOP is a horribly OOT over-engineering of a problem looking for a solution, from the get go. That it morphed and twisted into a bloated mess when it was taken up by people who didn't get it to begin with is just the inevitable result of starting with a big pile of no need to do all that in the first place. reply detourdog 15 hours agorootparentprevI think trustability is pretty specific and without a foundation of trust the rest of the effort”s value is unknowable. reply layer8 14 hours agorootparentThat’s “what we would like to have” (so mostly just a criticism that we don’t have it), but without much of a suggestion of how to actually achieve it in practice. reply detourdog 12 hours agorootparentThe current industry leaders of the effort want to proclaim that it is impossible to know where the answers come from. If that is the industry norm then I understand how achieving trustability could be mysterious. My line of thinking is that without an audit trail of thoughts there won't be any trustability. I'm unable to describe in detail what any one specific thing leads to trustability. I can say that being able to demonstrate where answers come from would work for me. reply agumonkey 14 hours agorootparentprevone real experiment he contributed to was VPRI ometa and the os built on top of that (every part of the OS built on top of an eDSL) reply theGnuMe 15 hours agorootparentprevTrue message passing is one of the key ideas behind smalltalk which would improve computer security considerably. This is analogous to the design of the internet that he references. The internet scales well. So imagine building entire computing systems this way. reply vajrabum 15 hours agorootparentIf smalltalk is late binding and message passing, I think it's interesting that modern large scale webapps (say Netflix or Google) do just that just not inside process and server boundaries. I'd guess that Alan Kay would think that's a bastardization, and there are loads of complications but it's a definite improvement over the large php ball of mud monolith you might have seen at say Box or Facebook 10-15 years ago. Because the 'object' boundaries are so coarse you can also better leverage the few people inside an org who know how to design, scale, improve robustness and secure systems. If architecture is the metaphor, it's still pretty much piling mud bricks but at least there are corbeled arches, streets, city walls, public buildings and a rudimentary notion of style. As for LLMs I think that long form typeahead is the right way to think about it. reply fzzzy 10 hours agorootparentI don't think he would think it is a bastardization. HTTP is 100% message passing. You have an object reference (url) and you pass a message to it with POST. State and behavior is encapsulated. In fact, one of the desireable properties of message passing is that it is easy to distribute across process and machine boundaries. reply layer8 14 hours agorootparentprevHow would it improve it, though? Dynamically-typed languages tend to introduce gradual typing after a while to increase reliability and predictability, and the end game of that (static typing) is the antithesis of late binding. Message passing only improves security by adding a validation layer, but managed languages (JVM, CLR, etc.) effectively do the same. > The internet scales well. So imagine building entire computing systems this way. That’s very similar to microservices, and look how messy these tend to get. The internet scales well because it’s a network with flexible capacity and attached processing power, and because its clients are either human users who can deal with failure modes, or software with stable and well-specified point-to-point protocols. reply theGnuMe 12 hours agorootparentIt’d be a big improvement. Rather than call a linked library function you’d send a message to whatever it was you needed the library function for.. this reduces the buffer overflow exploit potential and what not. That alone is a huge win. reply carapace 14 hours agorootparentprevYou are impressively wrong.

The papers and demos are the output. They were a research outfit, not a startup. OP claimed that Kay \"never offers anything but the most vague suggestions\" when he (et. al.) provided several very concrete working demos. It's hardly his fault if no one took him up on them, is it? (FWIW I suspect some of their work had an effect on MS Word & Excel UI but I don't know for sure.) > I haven't seen any significant new insights or advances. Where have you looked?

His writing style is something I am unable to comprehend. reply agomez314 15 hours agoparentprevwow this list is super useful, thanks for sharing! reply devjab 14 hours agoprevI use LLMs quite a lot to help me in my work, but they are wrong so often that it’s ridiculous. This isn’t a major issue when you’re an expert using the tools to be more efficient, because you’ll spot and laugh at the errors it makes. Sometimes it’ll be things that anyone would notice, like how a LLM will simply “invent” a library function that has never existed. Even if you’re not an expert, you’re not going to get that PNP-whatever function to work in Powershell if it never existed in the module to begin with. Where it becomes more dangerous, at least in my opinion, is when the LLM only gets it sort of wrong. Maybe the answer it gives you is old, maybe it’s inefficient, maybe it’s insecure or a range of other things, and if you’re new to programming, you’re probably not going to notice. Hell, I’ve reviewed code from senior programmers that pulled in deprecated things with massive security vulnerabilities and never noticed because they were too focused on fast delivery and “it worked”. I can’t imagine how that would work out for people trying to actually learn things. I’m not sure what we can really do about it though. I work a side gig as an external examiner for CS students. A lot of the curriculum being taught (at least here in Denmark) are things I’ve seen the industry move “beyond” in the previous 20 years. Some of it is so dated that it really makes no sense at all. Which isn’t exactly a great alternative to the LLMs, and it’s only natural that a lot of people simply turn to these powerful tools. I tend to tell people to ask their favorite LLM to help them solve a crossword. When you ask it to give you words ending on “ing” it’ll give you words that don’t end on “ing” because of how the tokens used work. This tends to be an eye opener for people in regards to how much they trust their LLM. At least until they get refined enough that they can also do these things. Anyway, it’s a good answer. reply sumtechguy 14 hours agoparentYesterday I asked it the date. Then asked it if it was possible to give me the date. It gave a very different answer that contradicted what it just did. It is kind of hard to trust when it can not even make itself consistent between 2 prompts. For creative prompts this thing is very cool. For logical prompts it is frustrating to no end how much detail it gets wrong. reply bongodongobob 14 hours agoparentprevI'm sorry, but it sounds like you're using ChatGPT3.5.

I tried something with GNU APL ... and the answers were purely ridiculous. It fabulated some totally wrong stuff based on Dyalog APL with invented libraries and more. Okay, I didn't expect usable results here but everyone should be aware... when even non-mainstream technologies are being discriminated, what about the human spectrum? reply slaymaker1907 11 hours agoprev> If we look at human anthropology, we see a species that treats solitary confinement and banishment from society as punishments — we are a society because we can cooperate and trust a little — but when are safely back in society, we start competing like mad (and cheating like mad) as though the society is there to be strip-mined. I really like this quote. We simultaneously value trust and community, yet so many people also treat it as just another resource to turn into money and power. Alan Kay is a real gem. reply ianbicking 13 hours agoprevThis feels like a limited and perhaps naive perspective on LLMs. If you looked at computers as adding machines in the 60s/70s then you'd be missing most of what was interesting about computers. And if you look at LLMs as a question answering service now, you are also missing a lot. It's hard to compare trust of LLMs to other computing, because many of the things that LLMs get wrong and right were previously intractable. You could ask a search engine, but it's certainly no more trustworthy than an LLM, gameable in its own way. The closest might be a knowledge graph or database, which can formally represent some portion of what an LLM represents. To be fair the relational systems can and will give \"no answer\" when an LLM (like a search engine) always gives some answer. Certainly an issue! But this is all in the realm of coming up with answers in a closed system, hardly the only way LLMs can be used. LLMs can also come up with questions, for instance creating queries for a database. Are these trustworthy? Not entirely, but the closest alternative supportive tool is perhaps some query builder...? I have seen expert humans come up with untrustworthy queries as well... misinterpretation of data is easy and common. That's just one example of how an LLM can be used. If you use an LLM for something that you can directly compare to a non-LLM system, such as speech recognition or intent parsing, it's clear that the LLM is more trustworthy. It can and does do real error correction! That is, you can get higher quality data out of an LLM than you put in. This is not unheard of in computing, but it is uncommon. Internet networking, which Kay refers to, might be an analog... creating reliable connections on top of unreliable connections. What we don't have right now is systematic approaches to computing with LLMs. reply alexvoda 12 hours agoparentThere was a time when a search engine would return no results if it didn't find anything instead of returning increasingly irrelevant results. It was a conscious decision by corporations to implement the dropping of constraints and search terms when too few results would have been returned. Today the search operators are a joke. reply pixl97 13 hours agoparentprev“All models are wrong, some are useful.” What's kind of funny is almost all the people that complain about accuracy of LLMs would gladly answer the question of \"What's the chance for rain today\" without giving giving you a 5 minute lecture on what forecasts actually mean. reply soperj 12 hours agorootparent\"I'm unable to provide real-time weather updates as my data is not current.

According to historical data, March typically sees an average of 17 rainy days in Seattle. Given that we're in the middle of March, there's a fairly high likelihood of rain on any given day.

It is true that with an LLM it can return something that is sensible but invented, where other systems typically return less inventive wrong answers. With any of these systems you want to balance the probability of an incorrect interpretation against the impact of the action being taken, and get confirmation based on that.

What else? reply altruios 15 hours agoparentwhat would be required for trusting an LLM? 1: 100% transparency. Open Source code, fully (and correctly) attributed training data. 2: A predictable model of what these models are actually encoding (so that hypothetical new models (or modifications) can be reasoned about). reply falsaberN1 15 hours agorootparentTransparency won't help a lot from a technical standpoint (seems more like a solution to a legal issue than a technical one). I can't trust LLMs because they just...recombine text by probabilities and aren't deterministic. I get incorrect information every time I ask them a thing, and it's incorrect in different ways every time. The only things they seem to get consistently correct are very widespread facts that are much faster and trivial to google. I still find it funny we managed to get image generation working so much better than text. reply chongli 13 hours agorootparentI still find it funny we managed to get image generation working so much better than text. If you care about veracity then image generation works about as well as text. Frequently you can find details of the image that are just bizarrely wrong, such as hands or food or other basic things. It's the same basic problem: there's no intelligence behind what it's doing, it just regurgitates mostly realistic-seeming pixels that are pretty good at fooling the casual viewer. Really, it's like those moths with eyespots on them: good at fooling the brain's heuristics but obviously not real. reply falsaberN1 9 hours agorootparentTry looking at things from my angle: A few errors in an image can be not much of a big deal (with modern tools, the mistakes are within human margin of error on average), but errors in delivery of textual data such as facts, dates or code can be far more severe and subtle. There are ways to work around or reduce the shortcomings of image generation, and the quirks you mention have drop-in solutions for local installs, but you can't quite fix wrong facts in text automatically, or the context going off-rails. It can be much harder to catch than a hand missing a finger, too. It's also worth mentioning you can run a heavily customized Stable Diffusion setup at home with fairly modest hardware with satisfactory results if you know what you are doing, but anything you can run at home for LLMs in the same hardware is dog slow and actually kind of terrible. reply ToucanLoucan 14 hours agorootparentprevSo much of the odd almost cultish community around LLMs seems to just be people who really want to be at the ground floor of the Next Big Thing who are so wildly biased into this being that next big thing that they will spend all their time, all their energy, not just on other people but on themselves, convincing themselves over and over that their LLM girlfriend really does love them, that their LLM assistant is going to be the next DaVinci, that their generated art is so much better than anything else. More than anything it makes me sad. ANY amount of critical thinking would tell you all of this is not true, which isn't to say there's NO USE AT ALL for this technology, it certainly exists and has it's applications, and I also do more or less believe someday we'll create digital intelligence, but at the same time... ChatGPT is not that. DALL-E is not that. These systems are interesting and they have uses but they are not emergent intelligence, they don't know anything, they just assemble words from massive probability matrices and then the people who read those words ascribe meaning to them that is far, far beyond what originated them. In this way it's not so dissimilar from any garden variety religion, it's just religion for people who think they're too smart to fall into the trap of motivated reasoning and magical thinking. reply RodgerTheGreat 14 hours agorootparentI think it's under-appreciated how much LLMs harvest the natural, human tendency to generously ascribe meaning, subtext, and intent to text they read, glossing over flaws and small mistakes so long as the overall \"thrust\" seems reasonable enough. In a sense, LLMs have reinvented cold-reading from first-principles and created the cleverest Hans of them all. reply adamrezich 13 hours agorootparentWe really should have figured out anthropomorphization and how to overcome it before we got to the \"AI age\". reply RodgerTheGreat 12 hours agorootparentOne of the worst-case scenarios I can presently imagine for LLMs is a world so drowned in semi-plausible nonsense that new generations teach themselves to simply ignore the printed word, subconsciously categorizing it as noise, and in so doing essentially un-invent literacy. reply fzzzy 9 hours agorootparentLiteracy isn't required if a computer can read any text.

(https://xkcd.com/1909/) reply pixl97 12 hours agorootparentprevHeh, I don't think you've had enough philosophy under your belt to realize how incredibly far we are from figuring that out... Or to say, \"It's Plato's cave all the way down\" reply Me1000 12 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be making a point in good faith so I would like to give you a slightly different perspective. I'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"cultish community\", from my perspective there are a few distinct communities around LLMs, all focusing on different aspects, all excited about different things. One common theme across all the groups though is that they used an LLM for the first time and their mind ran wild with the possibilities. That first moment when the LLM does something better than you expected, or even completely unexpected. I think most people understand that their imagination might be overactive in that moment. But it's a rare feeling to be surprised by a new technology (at least for me) these days. On the other end, we have social media platforms where being a pessimistic curmudgeon ends up getting the likes and shares. And it's just easier to be a pessimistic curmudgeon; the vast majority of ideas never work as well in the real world as they do in your head. I'm just as guilty of this as anyone else. But the real problem is that it puts us into tribes. As someone who is very excited about what LLMs are going to bring to our futures, when I see someone post on Mastodon or HN, or wherever, I become defensive and my monkey brain feels the urge to push back. In particular because I think the criticisms generally voiced are not well reasoned or thought out. Your own post has a tone of dismissal, painting a lot of people, all of whom excited about different things, as a cult who is obsessed with their LLM girlfriend. I would agree that anyone today trying to draw some deeper meaning from the outputs of these systems are probably worthy of dismissal, but I don't think that's the vast vast majority of people who are excited about LLMs. And it makes _me_ sad that the extremists are the ones that get to suck all the oxygen out of the conversation. We're in the beginning days of this new technology. LLMs are good at doing things traditional software isn't, and bad at doing a lot of things computers are traditionally good at. Natural language answer engines and sex bots might have been some of the first obvious applications of LLMs, but I'm willing to bet there are a lot more undiscovered use cases out there. Simon Willison has some great advice, which is for newcomers to try to break the LLM as quickly as they can, get it to lie to you, or do something wrong. Test its limits. That's part of the process! We're going to need some time to figure it all out and make these systems work well for us. I'm a technologist, and exploring this technology is exciting. reply ToucanLoucan 12 hours agorootparentI mean I think the biggest problem with the LLM community is that a sizable portion of not a majority of it consists of the exact same opportunistic \"ground floor\" people as just jumped off of cryptocurrency as the \"thing they refuse to shut up about\" which is all well and good when it's an exciting new thing that might change the world, but gets notably more insufferable when it's obviously just the newest route that person sees to getting greater amounts of money and/or social media clout, and they clearly do not know anything about it beyond it's potential to do those things. The colloquial term for that, I think, being \"grifter.\" And to be clear, LLMs are not unique in their ability to draw in those types of insufferable people: see the aforementioned comment about crypto, it was the last big one, and before that probably dropshipping. But I digress. And I bring all that up to say: no, the vast majority of people, I don't think expect the computer to come to life and tell them it loves them. I think the vast majority, in fact, don't know a fucking thing about LLMs beyond maybe the rote copy/pasted code it takes to bring one into existence, or if we're being honest, more likely, the websites to put their credit card information into to gain access to one for their use, and that shift in base assumptions I think explains why they speak so incoherently: they do not understand it in any depth, and thereofre, they might think the computer will come to life, because they don't know much about computers in general and to a layman, what an LLM does can indeed look like a vague imitation of life. Like, I mean this in the nicest way possible though just by virtue of what I'm going to say, it is going to sound mean, but: tons of the really big pro-AI hype people just, clearly, bluntly, full disclosure, do not know shit about LLM. Quite a large slice of that pie also don't know shit about technology in general, or seemingly, much of anything beyond a business degree? But irrespective of that, to the wider world who aren't in this and don't participate in the groups at hand... those are your representatives, by default.

For example, the proof of the absence of solution in SAT should be accompanied with the easily verifiable chain of reasoning. This shows the absence of incorrect deductions and missing assignments. Another example is autovectorization in contemporary compilers, they can show you why parts of your loops are not eligible for vectoriztion. All LM's can do is to show me that these parts of those inputs are important for that output, but nothing else. Thus, they cannot be trusted even for minimally critical tasks. reply pixl97 12 hours agorootparentEven you can't do that yourself.

It's the extreme of wealth accumulation, and there's always some people wanting to do that. Microsoft uses the idea of personal computers to get a monopoly on OSes, and get as much rent with that. Google and Amazon use the internet. Apple the iPhone with the walled garden. OPEC uses oil to extract as much wealth as possible. Toyota and VW would also get a monopoly and then raise prices it if they could. Why do you think VW bought so many other car makers? Boeing now that it is too big to fail, focuses on making more money, and less safety and excellence in engineering. Everyone does it. Well, every big business. It's a bad thing for sure, but doesn't seem specific to LLMs, and a solution would not be specific either. reply mempko 14 hours agorootparentIt's not specific to LLMs, but the point is LLMs will make things more efficient and therefore make 'a bigger straw' to drink the milkshake. reply lucianbr 51 minutes agorootparentIs that something that didn't apply to the internet when it was invented?

Again, this is orthogonal to the \"strip mine society\" concern. reply semi-extrinsic 11 hours agorootparentprevWhy will LLMs make things more efficient? As I see it, LLMs have the potential to either reduce the amount of \"bullshit jobs/tasks\", reduce the amount of time programmers spend on boilerplate, etc. But those inefficiencies are 95% human made, on purpose. Bullshit tasks are made up because middle managers want more underlings. Languages/frameworks with lots of boilerplate exist because companies would rather hire fifty average programmers rather than ten brilliant ones. Even if LLMs have the potential to make these things more efficient, the people holding the money bags don't want the inefficiencies removed. Consider influencers. What they post on social media could 100% be replaced by the outputs of LLMs and diffusion models. It would be vastly more efficient for companies to advertise their products by creating text and images about a pretty person using their products in an exotic location, than to pay for airplane tickets and hotels and salary for an influencer. Yet we don't see even a hint of the \"influencer revenue crisis\" that this would cause. reply fzzzy 9 hours agorootparentThe people holding the money bags who don't want the inefficiencies removed, will have their money bags removed by people who do.

No, we will not \"soon have ungodly powerful generative AIs\". At least, it's not likely. When we landed on the moon, people thought we would soon have Mars bases or even colonize other solar systems, yet here we are, 60 years later. It's naive to think every technology goes strictly on an exponential upward curve. Reality isn't that simple or repetitive, really. And, no, it's not \"different this time\".

One might find ambiguity in his criticism though, that LLM alone are insufficient... but, that's what Ximm's Law is saying. It's not very interesting to (as I would say, he does here) take on straw, rather than steel. (A steely defense of LLM is to say that no one is particularly interested in scaling LLM without other improvements, though scaling alone provides improvements; multi-modal, multi-language, long-context, and most of all augmented systems which integrate LLM into systems rather than making them \"systems on a chop\", are where things look and IMO will be interesting.) reply better_sh 13 hours agoprev [–] but what does Ja Rule think? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "pobody's nerfect — USB hubs, printers, Java, and more seemingly broken by macOS 14.4 update Issues seem to be related to security fixes made in Apple's latest OS. Andrew Cunningham - 3/18/2024, 8:06 PM Enlarge reader comments 109 A couple of weeks ago, Apple released macOS Sonoma 14.4 with the usual list of bug fixes, security patches, and a couple of minor new features. Since then, users and companies have been complaining of a long list of incompatibilities, mostly concerning broken external accessories like USB hubs and printers but also extending to software like Java. MacRumors has a good rundown of the list of issues, which has been steadily getting longer as people have run into more problems. It started with reports of malfunctioning USB hubs, sourced from users on Reddit, the Apple Support Communities forums, and elsewhere—USB hubs built into various displays stopped functioning for Mac users after the 14.4 update. Further Reading visionOS 1.1 tries to make Personas less unsettling, plus other Apple OS updates Other issues surfaced in the days after people started reporting problems with their USB hubs, including some instances of broken printer drivers, unexpected app crashes for some Java users, and problems launching apps that rely on the PACE anti-piracy software (and iLok hardware dongles) to authenticate. At least some of the problems seem localized to Apple Silicon Macs. In fact, iLok recommends running digital audio software in Rosetta mode as a temporary stopgap while Apple works on a fix. According to iLok, Apple has acknowledged this particular bug and is working on an update, but \"[has] not indicated a timeline.\" Advertisement The USB hub issue may be related to the USB security prompts that Apple introduced in macOS 13 Ventura, asking users to confirm whether they wanted to connect to USB-C accessories that they were connecting to their Mac for the first time. Some users have been able to get their USB hubs working again after the 14.4 update by making macOS request permission to connect to the accessory every time the accessory is plugged in; the default behavior is supposed to recognize USB devices that you've already connected to once. Scanning Apple's release notes or security update disclosures for the update doesn't reveal any smoking guns, but many of the security bugs were addressed with \"improved checks\" and \"improved access permissions,\" and it's certainly possible that some legitimate accessories and software were broken by one or more of these changes. The Oracle blog post about the Java problems refers to memory access issues that seem to be causing the crashes, though that may or may not explain the problems people are having with external accessories. The blog post also indicates that these bugs weren't present in the public developer betas of macOS 14.4. My desktop M2 Mac Studio setup, which is connected to a 4K Gigabyte M28U with a built-in USB hub, hasn't exhibited any unusual behavior since the update, so it's also possible that these issues aren't affecting every user of every Mac. If you haven't updated yet, it may be worth waiting until Apple releases fixes for some or all of these issues, even if you don't think you'll be affected. reader comments 109 Andrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

I never look at my Desktop and so never noticed it. I deleted the original, moved backup today, and there is nothing on my Desktop about Relocated Items. That could be because I removed it, like an Apple smart link thing, or maybe it was never there - dunno. IMO, if they're going to do something this drastic, they should at least have a one-time large pop-up box after the upgrade explaining that they moved things that were formerly in root, and wait for a user to confirm that they read the notice. reply nebula8804 18 hours agoparentprevSounds like Canon is really bad in supporting driver changes in subsequent OS releases. I recall diagnosing the same issue with a colleagues Mac over 10 years ago. She updated the OS and the printer she bought with the computer 3 OS'es ago stopped working. Turns out something with how Printers were handled changed and Canon refused to release updated drivers for a discontinued machine. I recall that some third party hobbyist had developed a method to make the printer work but it took hours to try and get it working until we just gave up....also her dog accidentally yanked on the printer cord and it went flying off the table. That was also motivation to stop trying. I am more inclined to blame Canon than Apple here. reply Rinzler89 18 hours agorootparentWhy? Windows has been the one updating itself making sure to not break backwards printer support, not the other way around. You can still use printers from the 90's on modern Windows, meanwhile MacOS seems to break support for recent printers between minor updates. It's not like they're a cash-strapped start-up, if Microsoft can afford to invest in maintaining backwards compatibility, so can Apple.

After all, not all companies are tech companies, who can afford large teams of expensive devs to keep updating their SW. For non-tech companies, the less dev work they have to invest in SW, the better, as that frees up resources for their main business activity. I for one if I'm the customer and the one spending the money I definitely want to be in charge, not be at the mercy of the manufacturer of product I spend money on to dictate how I should run my business, that I should invest more effort in keeping up with them.

Require that software be released at the end of the support lifecycle for all licensed customers to continue their use-case, and watch support lifecycles magically telescope outwards. It would require modification to copyright law in certain aspects (requiring “pass-through licensing” so to speak) and there’s utterly no will to tackle this in the US. But those sorts of issues are already problematic for, eg, music licensing for games/shows/etc. Some of these types of hyper-limited, time-gated, non-product-ownership-following licensing agreements need to just be outlawed as unconscionable when they’re gating hardware that ends up in landfills or cutting off the public’s access to cultural touchstones. Or just shorten copyright significantly in general. reply Rinzler89 14 hours agorootparentprevCanon doesn't develop MacOS. They advertise support for the version of MAcOS that existed when they launched the printer. If MacOS decides to break compatibility over time, it's not their fault. If they're not selling the printer today, they can't also provide up to date support for the OS of today. It's up to the OS developer to ensure a stable API for printers. reply acdha 13 hours agorootparent“Break compatibility” can cover a wide range of things, however, and that’s not always so clear cut. For example, if they were relying on lax permissions or a private interface then it’s a question of how much effort the OS vendor should spend on something they never promised would work. reply paulmd 12 hours agorootparentprevImagine the IP camera vendors saying this :skull: “What can you possibly be complaining about!? It was secure when we released it! Maybe you should just buy a new one with less vulnerabilities!” EU isn’t wrong that people have an intuitive sense that appliances like printers should have a worthwhile lifecycle and for some classes of devices this lifecycle should be quite long. 10 years really isn’t unreasonable. Also, just like everyone has to support usb-c charging regardless of whatever other proprietary alternative they design… vendors should have to support a couple generic standards (postscript/Ghostscript and CUPS) that relieve a lot of the ongoing maintenance.

The comment thread we're in was talking about the Canon D530 which was released in 2012, which supposedly broke in MacOS Monterey released in 2021. It's a stretch to call 9 years \"moving fast and breaking things\". reply Rinzler89 14 hours agorootparentHold on there buckaroo. Having a 9 year old printer at home is no big deal as consumers don't usually upgrade their printers if they still work and compatible ink cartridges are still available. My parents are still running a 20+ year old Canon, because it's easy to refill cheaply. And things don't exist in a vacuum but in comparison to others. To wit, does that Canon printer from 2012 work in present day versions of Windows and Linux? If yes, then why is MacOS the odd one out here? So what's stopping Apple from providing the same level of reliable printer support as Microsoft and Linux? It sure as hell aint lack of money. reply nozzlegear 13 hours agorootparentI don't work at Apple nor do I have much more insight into their philosophy than you, so I can only refer you to my previous speculation: > It seems like Apple just prefers that companies release software that they will actually maintain reply callalex 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat has changed since 2012 in the document printing space that would make that perfectly good machine obsolete?

It's not like printers are devices we need all too much anymore. It's perfectly reasonable to assume that users will have discontinued printers at home. Kinda similar to Rosetta 1 and 32 bit binaries on x86. I get their motivation but killing Rosetta 1 basically meant that all old games that came out in the PPC era couldn't be played anymore and killing of 32 bit binaries made the Apple logo in Steam useless. It's not like people expect that this works like how early win32 application still work on Windows. They could totally make the user jump through a bunch of hoops to get support for their old applications. But they didn't. reply turquoisevar 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd at a significant cost at that. Windows has become a hodgepodge of code bases from a variety of time periods and philosophies, some of which leans on some ancient stuff that can’t be touched. Hell, they had to skip Windows 9, just to prevent breaking 95/98 software from braking. The average SW engineer here in HN wouldn’t know how fast they’d get to a keyboard to complain if they were to find a codebase like that at their job. That’s not to say it’s necessarily bad, even if it can be cumbersome, it’s just to highlight the cost of maintaining that compatibility and a difference in philosophy. reply boolemancer 17 hours agorootparentprevHow on earth is it Canon's fault when Apple releases a breaking change? reply EricE 16 hours agorootparentWell for starters Canon installers do strict version checks. And they often stop updating their drivers, especially for older printers. I got very good about editing the installer files to either add newer versions of macOS or to just remove the version checks. The drivers always worked after I did so.

Apparently the Java issue only affects Apple silicon for some reason reply shagie 19 hours agorootparentFrom 2020 https://www.securemac.com/news/arm-macs-faq > Write XOR execute (W^X) > Apple Silicon Macs will enforce a restriction called “write XOR execute” (W^X). This means that chunks of memory will be designated as writable, or as executable, but never as both at the same time. Many macOS apps contain performance optimization programs that require memory to be both writable and executable, but this can lead to serious security issues. By enforcing W^X, Apple will harden Mac security at the memory level. App developers, however, won’t be left out in the cold — if they still need those optimization programs for their apps, they can use a new macOS API that provides a way to switch between write and execute permissions quickly and safely. And the nature of W^X - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX > W^X (\"write xor execute\", pronounced W xor X) is a security feature in operating systems and virtual machines. It is a memory protection policy whereby every page in a process's or kernel's address space may be either writable or executable, but not both. Without such protection, a program can write (as data \"W\") CPU instructions in an area of memory intended for data and then run (as executable \"X\"; or read-execute \"RX\") those instructions. This can be dangerous if the writer of the memory is malicious. W^X is the Unix-like terminology for a strict use of the general concept of executable space protection, controlled via the mprotect system call. --- See also Porting just-in-time compilers to Apple silicon - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/port...

So the weeks/months before the release, probably most of the focus of the OS (and infrastructure) teams was on the March 6 deadline. I imagine that they had all security updates rolled into the macOS 14.4 and iOS 17.4 branches already. Then when March 6 came around, they released iOS 17.4 and they had to rush out macOS 14.4 as well (macOS 14.4 was already a day later than iOS 17.4, which is untypical for Apple), to avoid that bad actors find macOS vulnerabilities by looking at iOS changes. reply speak_plainly 19 hours agoprevAdd this to the list of issues: “macOS Sonoma 14.4 Bug 'Destroys Saved Versions in iCloud Drive'” https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/sonoma-bug-destroys-sav... reply dalke 19 hours agoprevI got this from my bank's id authentication app: > BankID on card and macOS > A change was introduced by Apple in macOS 14 where one consequence is that BankID on card stops working for some users.

What I am is skeptical that subjective pulse checks of social media threads are a good way to measure software quality. They're a decent way to measure public sentiment, not actual error rates. reply hylaride 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I haven't seen an apple \"fanboy\" in the classic sense of the word in over a decade. I mean, the daring fireball guy always gives apple the benefit of the doubt, but I've ran into far more people with a borderline irrational hatred of apple to the point where they can't not complain. I was a total apple advocate between 2004-2014. Now it's become just preferable to windows (although the trackpad on laptops is miles ahead of anything in PC land I've come across). I'm getting more and more annoyed at the iphone, but the alternative is a phone run by an advertising company... reply freedomben 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, I think you have nailed it. I have seen this same phenomenon happen in nearly every niche that I pay attention to. Only thing I would add is that a lot of articles are based on tweets, often from random users where the article author did nothing to verify and just included the tweet as the source reply alt227 18 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, the media has been doing this for at least 10 years. reply wasyl 18 hours agoparentprevI'd guess not the latter — anecdotally, my intel mac has been increasingly sluggish after each macos upgrade, even after a clean install. I finally decided to revert to the oldest macos version possible (and then update by just one major version since unfortunately some apps I need don't support Catalina anymore) and the difference is night and day — my memory was right and my laptop _was_ faster before. And it's not hardware getting old or battery problems, it's the OS. So I don't know if older macs are intentionally crippled or they're just ignored during QA, but I don't believe they're actually intentionally supported reply danieldk 18 hours agorootparentI don't know if older macs are intentionally crippled or they're just ignored during QA, More likely neither. Software just becomes larger and more complex and thus slower on older hardware. (My 2021 MacBook Pro 14\" is still lightning-fast though, I never wait for anything.) reply wasyl 18 hours agorootparent> Software just becomes larger and more complex and thus slower on older hardware. So every major OS update is larger and more complex, so it's to be expected that after ~4 of those my machine lags when doing literally everything? It's not that I'm running tons of background apps, it's a powerful machine lagging on a clean install of a recent macOS version when doing basic operations like opening a webpage. > My 2021 MacBook Pro 14\" is still lightning-fast though, I never wait for anything. I suppose it's Apple Silicon? Because that would still be in line with Intel-based macs becoming less performant over time reply switch007 18 hours agorootparentprevMy intel MacBook lags in such a predictable and constant way, as if a process is running constantly at 99% CPU. Makes me a bit suspicious How much have they /really/ added to the OS (which is enabled on my hardware) and consuming extra resources? reply wasyl 18 hours agorootparentA while ago I went into a rabbit hole looking for something to support my hunch (which I now confirmed by installing old macos) and found some discussions about graphics/OpenGL APIs being deprecated and removed over time. I have a very uneducated guess that new-macos-on-old-hardware runs some translation for all graphics operations/APIs, which causes perceptible lag when doing _anything_, because everything draws on the screen. It does feel as if the OS is constantly struggling with some background tasks reply jsmith99 19 hours agoparentprevThis macOS version only supports models since 2017-19 (depending on product line). Apple don’t really have an excuse compared to Microsoft since they only have a few hardware options. It’s amusing to compare the comments here to the comments on windows update threads. As nobody else has, let me add the reminder for everyone to switch to . reply cqqxo4zV46cp 18 hours agorootparentLet’s be clear. 2017 is SEVEN years ago.

You expect more from them than any other computer company. reply TonyTrapp 19 hours agoparentprevI have doubts it's the latter - just a day or two ago there was an article trending on HN that building Hackintoshes is becoming harder and harder because Apple is removing drivers for old hardware only found in Macs that are not supported anymore. reply joshspankit 19 hours agorootparentAlso doubt it’s the latter: Compatibility with old hardware has never been high on Apple’s priority list. reply RedShift1 18 hours agoparentprevWindows updates before MS fired their QA department were uneventful, after they fired their QA department, serious issues started popping up every single month. Including server systems not booting anymore. reply Karellen 17 hours agorootparentThat doesn't track for me. One of the reasons MS introduced \"patch Tuesday\" in 2003 was because Windows updates until then had been notorious for years for causing issues randomly, which their corporate users hated firefighting without warning. By rolling out their updates on a predictable schedule, corporate IT depts could set their calendar to keep a day (or two) per month clear to do post-update firefighting, or (if they were really on the ball) to make time for their own QA before releasing the update to the rest of the org. So unless the QA firing you're talking about was more than a quarter-century ago, Windows updates have always been issue-laden shitshows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday reply RedShift1 16 hours agorootparentAny issues were really minor. I worked for an MSP for most of the Windows XP through Windows 8 era and update problems were anomalies, not par for the course. If there were problems, they were newsworthy events. reply FireBeyond 18 hours agoparentprevThere's also cases where (shockingly to some) Apple just doesn't care. I'm still more than bitter, after buying some nice 27\" 4K HDR 144Hz monitors that Apple actively broke (and may still be broken) Display Stream Compression 1.4 for the Pro Display XDR. When it was released, there were questions about how Apple was managing to drive that display. Well, the answer is because they absolutely nerfed/bastardized DSC 1.4 from Big Sur to make it happen with some proprietary magic: those same screens could now only be driven at 60Hz in HDR10 or 95Hz in SDR. Proof in the pudding was that my monitors (LG27GN950-B) actually allowed you to change the advertised/supported DSC version, and when I \"downgraded\" the monitors to DSC 1.2, performance actually improved, and allowed 120Hz SDR and 95Hz HDR. This happened with many many users, across many screen types. And if you downgraded to Catalina? Boom, back to 144 Hz. Apple studiously ignored it, and may still be. They simply don't care if you're not using an Apple display. reply radicality 16 hours agorootparentBtw, do you mean you downgraded DP to 1.2? I think there isn’t a DSC 1.4 (only DP 1.4 which has DSC 1.2, and DP1.4a with DSC 1.2a). Do you have any more info/links about this? I’m curious, since I do have a Pro Display XDR, and I’ve been trying to understand for some time how exactly it’s able to reach its bandwidth, which is definitely a rabbit hole. reply FireBeyond 15 hours agorootparentApologies, you're right. DP 1.4 - just looked at the manual (for the LG 27GN750-B, though I know that many other monitors were affected). Has been a couple of years now. Ironically, I too, moved to the XDR. Downgrading to DP 1.2 improved the display options from DP 1.4. reply hedora 19 hours agoprevThey keep breaking and + unbreaking my old Samsung Laser Printer (PCL compliant) I think 14.4 fixed it, for what it's worth. Since Linux CUPS and Apple use the same underlying open source drivers, Arch is bug-for-bug compatible. I wish they performed some sort of automatic regression testing on stuff like this. reply tgv 18 hours agoparentI have an old Samsung laser printer, and the only machine that can print to it is a macbook. I've got a Windows PC, and it won't install the driver that is supposedly recommended (weirdly enough by HP?), while another version of that driver can't connect to the printer. It's quite bizarre. reply Neikius 14 hours agoprevI moved from m1 MacBook pro to m2 recently. Just like that my monitor's built in KVM stopped working in a reasonable manner. Can use it to drive the web camera which sometimes works normally and sometimes with shitty frame rate. Microphone now appears and then gets evicted (rode USB mic), my headphone preamp will crackle like mad so it is useless... I got this monitor specifically to be able to work with the stupid m1 limitation of 1 external screen and to be able to switch seamlessly to my secondary rig. And it could be connected using one cable as it does power delivery. Now I have an expensive montor that is useless for the purpose I got it for. Not sure whether to blame dell or apple but do not remember many instances of issues like this in my life. Being a PC guy forever and now got forced to use apple for work. Really don't understand why it's being pushed so much in corporate env. lately? Maybe I am just weird. reply Centigonal 20 hours agoprevEver since updating last week, one of my two monitors (connected through a CalDigit USB-C dock) won't turn back on after inactivity. I have to open up System Settings, change the resolution for the monitor, and change it back every time I leave my macbook and come back. reply mleo 18 hours agoparentIf a resolution change fixes the issue, consider a short term fix of using displayplacer. It's a cli tool for updating resolution or placement of displays. I use it in combination with Stream Deck/Keyboard Maestro to toggle the resolution of second monitor during Teams screen sharing to provide a lower resolution for display challenged colleagues. reply acdha 18 hours agoparentprevHave you checked for firmware updates on the dock? I had a problem like that years ago where it basically turned out that the dock was doing something dodgy and an updated macOS stopped tolerating it, but fortunately they had a firmware update available which brought it into compliance. reply ethbr1 19 hours agoparentprevHave you tried a KVM switch? I have one in my setup and toggling it off and then back (via button) is a quicker way to solve freak-outs. reply Centigonal 19 hours agorootparentI have a USB switch for my peripherals, but I haven't needed a KVM until now.

I have a script in my dotfiles to recognize when an apple update overwrites `/etc/zshrc` to run, among other things, a utility that rewrites your path in a nonstandard way (I don't remember the details, I think it was something related to config file load order?)

I prefer to set my path in ~/.zshenv so I don't have to worry about anything misbehaving in non-login shells, but this rabbithole led me to a good option to cover both: https://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2003/msg00600.html reply turquoisevar 14 hours agoparentprevIs there a particular reason you’re not putting .zshrc in the user’s home folder ~/.zshrc? In any case, / root and /etc (to an extend) are part of the system volume (or rather the system volume snapshot if we want to be pedantic). With some exceptions Apple considers that fair game. There’s a bunch of symlinking and firmlinking done to make it look like one coherent whole but only the stuff on the data volume is safe. That said, if for whatever reason you need to put something in root you can create your own synthetic firmlink[0] with /etc/synthetic.conf. I believe some also reported success by simply making a subdirectory under /etc and use that instead but YMMV. hoakly goes into extensive detail with what changed with volumes on macOS (back in 2019 I believe): https://eclecticlight.co/2021/01/13/big-sur-boot-volume-layo... 0: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/creating-root-l... reply spurgu 19 hours agoprevThe application window switching has been glitching ever since I was forced to upgrade recently[0]. Instead of switching between windows of the same app it (using the keyboard shortcut) sometimes includes windows of all apps. Rebooting helps. Sometimes it starts working again for some unexplained reason after a while. Super annoying. To be clear I'm talking about Keyboard shortcuts -> Keyboard -> Move focus to next window. [0] I was running Big Sur because none of the recent MacOS updates really offered anything of interest to me, since I don't use most Apple software. But Homebrew and Element stopped working so I had to upgrade. I should've just upgraded to a newer, not to the newest version (which I tend to avoid due to issues like these that might come up). Lesson learned. reply freedomben 19 hours agoparentI know this isn't helpful, but it's genuinely very surprising to me that this is the case with a company like apple that controls tightly the entire stack in part because they want to tightly control the experience, that you would not be comfortable upgrading to the latest version immediately. Particularly given how much of a premium you pay to get into that system. On Fedora Linux, upgrading has gotten remarkably safe, especially if you take advantage of some of the options that use a/b partitions to allow rollbacks. reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentI’ve been comfortable upgrading on day one for a couple decades, and have never had a problem. The difference in most cases is the areas where Apple doesn’t control – I don’t use a lot of third-party extensions but a lot of apps, even popular ones like Dropbox, used to do pretty invasive things which were prone to breaking. People in industries like audio production where much of the software has DRM systems have decades of scar tissue from that kind of stuff, so I totally understand why they hesitate. reply warvair 17 hours agoprevStrangely enough, at about the time this macOS update came out, the virtual USB hub in my Win7 VM (Fusion 11.5.7), which I run on a Catalina (10.15.7) Mac broke.

As a result I won't be buying more Apple hardware and have moved back to Linux as the primary machine - super fast and stable, with a slight setup tax and occasional annoyances. reply freedomben 18 hours agoparentWhat brand and model of laptop hardware do you buy now?

But otherwise, my experience with Fedora on framework hardware has been remarkable reply pdimitar 18 hours agorootparentNot your parent poster. I know libre everything is an important cause to fight for but I didn't want to beta-test new products so I bought a refurbished HP 15s about two years ago. Full AMD configuration (I was specifically looking for that) and the CPU (5500U) is surprisingly fast. I have put 32GB RAM and 2TB SSD with high durability value and just recently provisioned the machine with Manjaro + XFCE. Works amazingly quickly and everything was fine out of the box (used my Airpods Max as well).

One of the fixes this release is untrainable SIGKILLs programs for illegal memory accesses, which is a perfectly boring and sensible security practice — and also is causing much of the drama everyone’s seeing. Presumably there’s also a new Celebrite attack over USB-C / PCIe / Thunderbolt, and fixing it urgently has uncovered either a USB/TB spec bug, an implementation bug in the OS, or an implementation bug in the devices. It’s usually the devices, but sometimes it’s not. reply Aloisius 14 hours agorootparent> One of the fixes this release is untrainable SIGKILLs programs for illegal memory accesses, which is a perfectly boring and sensible security practice Why is preventing trapping on an illegal memory access a sensible security practice? Preventing the access, sure, but I'm not seeing what force killing a process does for security, especially given there are perfectly reasonable reasons why one might want to trap the signal. reply grodriguez100 18 hours agorootparentprev> One of the fixes this release is untrainable SIGKILLs programs for illegal memory accesses, which is a perfectly boring and sensible security practice The signal raised for page faults should be (and actually was, before 14.4) SIGSEGV, and not SIGKILL. This behaviour is even defined by POSIX. There is no reason why this should change, specially not in the final release instead of in the public betas and early access releases (where the change was not present). reply altairprime 18 hours agorootparentTo clarify so that I’m not responding incompletely, are we seeing all page faults, i.e. process swapped to disk, now raise SIGKILL — or is this behavior reserved only for certain page faults, i.e. out-of-bounds and permission-denied (R^X) accesses? The former would be a catastrophic defect and probably result in the release being pulled from distribution. The latter would be a new classification of certain kinds of page faults as “safe” and “unsafe”, and only the safe ones are allowed to comply with POSIX signal handling. Perhaps they’ll propose an update to POSIX now that the zero day response has shipped. reply beeboobaa 20 hours agoprev [17 more] [flagged] corytheboyd 19 hours agoparentStill massively prefer it to Windows when those are the only two choices (picking a work computer).

    "originBody": "News Health & Medicine Long COVID brain fog may be due to damaged blood vessels in the brain The result suggests there is a biological basis for this symptom Brain fog is a debilitating symptom commonly reported by people with long COVID. Now, scientists have linked the symptom to leaky boundaries in the brain. baona/iStock/Getty Images Plus Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pocket Reddit Print By Meghan Rosen March 15, 2024 at 8:30 am Leakiness in the brain could explain the memory and concentration problems linked to long COVID. In patients with brain fog, MRI scans revealed signs of damaged blood vessels in their brains, researchers reported February 22 in Nature Neuroscience. In these people, dye injected into the bloodstream leaked into their brains and pooled in regions that play roles in language, memory, mood and vision. It’s the first time anyone’s shown that long COVID patients can have leaky blood brain barriers, says study coauthor Matthew Campbell, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. That barrier, tightly knit cells lining blood vessels, typically keeps riffraff out of the brain, like bouncers guarding a nightclub. The best of Science News - direct to your inbox Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your email inbox every Thursday. Continue If the barrier breaks down, bloodborne viruses, cells and other interlopers can sneak into the brain’s tissues and wreak havoc, says Avindra Nath, a neurologist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. It’s too early to say definitively whether that’s happening in people with long COVID, but the new study provides evidence that “brain fog has a biological basis,” says Nath, who wasn’t involved with the work. That alone is important for patients, he says, because their symptoms may be otherwise discounted by physicians. For some people, brain fog can feel like a slowdown in thinking or difficulty recalling short-term memories, Campbell says. For example, “patients will go for a drive, and forget where they’re driving to.” That might sound trivial, he says, but it actually pushes people into panic mode. Campbell’s team studies repetitive head trauma. They knew that traumatic brain injuries can disrupt the blood brain barrier — and that people with these injuries sometimes report having brain fog. That mental muddling reminded the team of what people with long COVID can experience. Maybe the blood brain barrier disruption seen in some concussion patients applies to long COVID brain fog, too, the researchers surmised. Evidence for SARS-CoV-2’s damaging effects on the brain has been mounting for years. Studies in cells and animals suggest the virus can crumble components of the blood brain barrier. And autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 reveal barrier breakdowns, Nath and others have shown. In long COVID patients with brain fog (brain scan at right), dye injected into the bloodstream tends to leak into the brain (see colored speckles) more so than in people without brain fog (left). C. Greene et al./Nature Neuroscience 2024 But until now, no one knew if this kind of damage persisted long after the initial infection subsided. The team scanned the brains of 32 people, 10 of whom had recovered from COVID-19, and 22 with long COVID. Of those with long COVID, half reported having brain fog. An injected dye lit up all the participants’ brains during MRI brain scans. In people recovered from COVID, the dye had trouble crossing the blood brain barrier. Likewise, in long COVID patients without brain fog, the dye mostly stayed put, confined within blood vessels. But in eight of 11 participants with brain fog, the dye tended to escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue. “It was just so clear,” Campbell says. He remembers one of the first people scanned, someone with severe brain fog. Their temporal lobes, brain regions that sit behind the eyes, were “just flooded with this dye,” he says. The researchers’ work suggests that “brain fog wasn’t just a figment of [patients’] imagination,” Campbell says. “It was a very, very real thing that they were reporting.” The new findings offer an opportunity to think about potential therapies, Nath says. Perhaps researchers can find a way to slow down the blood brain barrier’s breakdown — or reverse it. Questions or comments on this article?

    "commentBody": "Long Covid brain fog may be due to damaged blood vessels in the brain (sciencenews.org)170 points by wahnfrieden 5 hours agohidepastfavorite67 comments EMM_386 12 minutes agoI was affected by this \"brain fog\" after getting Covid, but I didn't put two and two together. I called my doctor's office to schedule an appointment and when the receptionist asked what the appointment was for, I simply said \"brain fog\". I had no other way to describe it. It was intense and disturbing. I often couldn't put cohererent thoughts together, I was constantly forgetting what I was doing, forgetting where I had just put something. Over the coming weeks is slowly receded, but there's no doubt it is real. I've had people dismiss it as \"it's all in your mind\". They're right on some level ... it was in my mind. But it was very real, and I have no doubt it was SARS-CoV-2 related due to the timing and sheer intensity of it. reply swagatkonchada 0 minutes agoparentDo you still feel like this? Is there anything that helped you? reply SOLAR_FIELDS 4 hours agoprevI’ll share an abridged long COVID story about myself since it dearly affected me. Just so other people can kind of know what the experience was like. I got sick in October 2020 before vaccines were available. After the initial 10 days which I would describe as moderate, borderline severe (6/10, where 7/10 is hospital and 9/10 is ICU) I had all manner of absolutely weird things happen to my body. I won’t go into the details about the actual illness since the symptoms are well documented but suffice to say I had breathing issues and there was a lot of monitoring with the pulse oximeter First, heart pain. Stabbing in the chest. I got on colchicine and saw a cardiologist. That lasted probably 2-3 months before it finally went away. I had ekg and echocardiogram, both came up clean. Second, Reynauds. I live in Texas and it gets a little cold but not Nordic cold. For the first time in my life I had Reynauds symptoms during the winter and I lost feeling in my toes entirely unless they were submerged in hot water for multiple minutes. This happened many times that winter. Next, weird food allergies. Eating anything with gluten caused me to, I kid you not, have me in bed gasping for air for hours at a time. I ate a pizza in this time period and instantly regretted it and that continued for hours. More extremely strange circulatory issues: I wore a pair of running shoes for years and years before I got sick. I wore that same pair of shoes and it created lines and pain around my feet such that I went to the ER thinking it was a blood clot. No, it’s just that my tight shoes literally just bruised my feet for no explainable reason when they had never done that before. POTS. Standing up made my heart rate spike for no reason. This is a measurable phenomena for people who have autoimmune disorders called the tilt table test. Had this for months Everything luckily for me mostly went away within around 6 months. I had a lingering chest pain in breath that is now mostly gone that I genuinely thought I would deal with for the rest of my life. I think it’s basically gone now after almost 4 years. I’m a scientific dude. My conclusion after all this is that it’s autoimmune and that no one actually understands the mechanism which is why people who complain about this get dismissed. It’s easier for a doctor to say “it’s all in your head” than to admit that the current body of knowledge of medicine simply does not understand what is happening to people’s bodies. I wish and hope that so many people suffering from this stuff like I did changes that perspective a bit. reply borkt 1 hour agoparentPrecisely what happened to me. Doctor botched the disgnosis, my department in local government did everything in their power to push me out immediately upon sharing an honest assesment of how I was feeling, asserting that I was voluntarily resigning rather than genuinely ill - which came across as retaliation for some of them having to return to the office in my stead, as prior to catching covid-19 and suffering the above effects I had been the sole volunteer to work from the office and liase with the public on everyone elses behalf. There wasn’t much if any info about ling covid at the time, and HR ignored emails sent over the next year as I tried to apologize for my illness and communicate what it clearly turned out to be. Completely healthy now, but passed over after every first interview no matter what I do or do not share about what lead me to leave the previous role. If you had to leave work, do you have any suggestions as to how I may come accross as employable again? reply A_D_E_P_T 48 minutes agorootparentI didn't write the parent comment, but I'd note that being unemployable is a great reason to start your own business, and if you do it right you'll never need to answer to anybody again. (Besides customers, that is, but customers are usually a lot friendlier than HR departments.) Another option would be to pick up freelance work. This can often lead to fulltime employment, particularly when a company hires you for a short gig and you impress them. reply johnnyanmac 29 minutes agorootparentPeople generally see work because they need money, and meanwhile a business is one of the biggest money sinks when starting out. I don't really understand why people suggest this as general advice. If you're not already extremely experienced and established in your field, or if you don't have years of savings to live off, I can't imagine starting a business impromptu going well. You need a plan. reply npunt 1 hour agoparentprevI strongly urge anyone dealing with these issues to look into the gut biome as a source of clues and experimentation. A lot is not known about the gut biome but we're discovering many autoimmune and autoimmune-like conditions are related to it. Some things to do: get biome tests regularly, go on an elimination diet, find the right supplements, join various LC/mecfs communities doing this work. The short answer is the medical system really doesn't know what to do here and if you're dealing w this stuff you have to take it into your own hands and familiarize yourself with the areas the medical system doesn't focus on. reply ljf 2 hours agoparentprevSo sorry to hear the way this affected you. My wife had/has long covid - as I listened to people she met online with LC and a couple of people we knew already, what fascinated me was the 'menu' of symptoms that people got and just how different they could be, though overlapping. She too had the POTS and range of aches and issues. While she's largely recovered now, she still has to pace herself. Really hoping this is better understood in the future, and that we are better able to treat people with it. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 2 hours agorootparentI’m basically 100% fine now, but thanks. I just wish I could have told the me that existed right when I started having this happen that it would eventually get better. At the time it was very scary thinking that I might have to deal with POTS or shortness of breath for the rest of my life or that my organs were permanently damaged in some way. I find myself more fortunate than most in that I never really had the fatigue and brain fog issues that plagued and possibly still plague many others. I could definitely see those things being quite detrimental to my mental health in the long term if I had them. reply ljf 56 minutes agorootparentTotally this - am many times as I said 'you will get better from this' - we both knew that was just a hope. She's so much better now, and getting rid of POTS symptoms was a massive turning point for her, esp as we kept being told that no one recovers from POTS. And yes, a friend of mine (male model in his 30s) who also had LC, could cycle for hours (no physical fatigue), but mental tasks totally wiped him out. reply gnicholas 4 hours agoparentprevSeveral of these (Reynauds, food/digestion issues) sound like things that my family member dealt with after long-something-else. He was bedridden for nearly 2 years, diagnosed with CFS, and then (many years later) Lupus. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 4 hours agorootparentThis comment just reinforces my belief that it’s autoimmune related. I have never had Reynauds (or ANY of these symptoms) before or after this. It was the first and only time I have ever seen any of the things I mentioned happen to my body. They just… went away and I was normal again eventually, luckily for me. Many aren’t so lucky reply throwitaway222 3 hours agorootparentMy wife got POTS for the first time in 2022, but we tested and tested and tested, we both never got Covid - but I have been suspecting that the tests were just junk. No other time in our life did her autoimmune issues that basically went away 8 years ago, came back 10x harder. Same thing with almost all of your symptoms. She's finally slowly getting better, but she still can't eat gluten right now. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 3 hours agorootparentSorry to hear about your wife. As grandparent comment implies, it’s likely not just COVID that causes these autoimmune problems, but COVID is the thing that most people in recent times got that caused this, so it gets the most press. From my research I discovered that ME/CFS/Lupus and a lot of other autoimmune related illnesses have been documented in medicine for decades but until COVID the medical field largely considered these illnesses as mostly just a fringe medical phenomena for interested researchers that was blown off by modern medical practitioners because the science to understand it is incomplete. Now that enough people like myself and you on behalf of your wife are out talking about it, the hope is that science will eventually catch up and figure out why this kind of thing happens reply ZoomerCretin 2 hours agorootparentprevLast year I caught COVID twice. Both times I felt sick, I tested myself daily, and I was negative every time I swabbed my nostrils and nasopharynx. Both times, I started swabbing any yellow mucus that I expelled, and received the positive result that I expected. reply mentos 1 hour agoparentprevI too believe my long covid symptoms were an autoimmune issue. Read my HN post from 2021 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26350951#26355878 reply bouncycastle 2 hours agoparentprevWould it be possible that something else caused it, leading you to also have a more severe episode of COVID? Perhaps you had a preexisting undiagnosed immune disorder, which expressed itself during the COVID episode? reply ratg13 1 hour agorootparentOne of the main theories is that the Covid is hiding in areas of the body, and this of course will mess with your other immune responses. I experienced something similar to OP. Took me around 12-18 months before I felt like the symptoms were abating. reply insaider 1 hour agoparentprevI've had similar symptoms for 7+ years now so it's most likely for life. Have seen many infectious disease specialists and CFS/ME is the diagnosis (same as long-covid). Mine seems to have been triggered by Glandular Fever (Epstein Barr Virus). Exertion is the biggest trigger for me, but also the prescribed cure (Gradual Exercise Therapy). Alcohol is a weird one, I often feel better with a hangover than I do on a bad fatigue day (immuno-suppressant?) but then way worse the days after. I also have recurring Mononucleosis symptoms and have tried anti-virals to no avail... It's so obviously immuno-related, really hope the science progresses soon.

There probably is no such specific thing as \"long covid\", its just this syndrome that was always a thing. reply nso 4 hours agoprevBetween MS and having had COVID 4+ times, first one giving me long for 6 months, it's a miracle my brain keeps ticking.

Eliminating it would be akin to removing the name \"stomach cancer\" because other cells can also become cancerous. You need a name for things.

The study is observational, based on reported symptoms with no physiological or detailed functional follow-up data. Without laboratory pathophysiological assessment of individual patients, it is impossible to say that this is indistinguishable from flu-related or any other post-viral syndrome. Of course, every 'puchy-headline' paper deserves to be considered on its own merits, but perhaps read the paper not an article about the paper if you want to take it as 'The Truth'. \"Long covid is not a thing\" plays into the \"Covid is not a thing\" conspiracy theory; it's probably a harmful trope, rather than meaningfully helpful for the people suffering symptoms.

That something plays into a harmful trope doesn’t speak to its veracity though, and diminishing smaller inconvenient truths so as to not lead people astray in my opinion exacerbates rather than diminishes conspiracy theories. Could probably have prevented a lot of wasted time, money, and endless internet arguments by saying something early on like “ivermectin, which humans are regularly prescribed, does look promising for treating Covid, but only at dosages that are very toxic to humans, or in populations that might have parasites, as a result of curing those parasites”, instead of the “lol it’s only for horses!” stuff, or by clearly stating “lab leak is possible, and not the same thing as an intentionally man-made bioweapon unleashed by Chinese people”. reply npunt 33 minutes agorootparentIf the potential effect of a message is rather harmful, it's reasonable to hold the veracity of that message to a higher standard of scrutiny than if a message is benign. This wasn't a good study, scientifically. Scrutiny was not applied before reporting on it, and now we have a harm on our hands. The fact that we're discussing it attests to that, since its a sideshow leeching attention away from the main topic of long covid's effects. Agree that public messaging could have and should be a lot better on the topics you mentioned, but disagree that harm should not be at least a part of the calculus. reply jonReadingNews 4 hours agoprevSARS-CoV-2 not only infects the brain it continues to replicate inside neurons.

Sweatshop work isn't a great option, but I would say it's objectively a better option than starving to death. Just because something doesn't meet the baseline definition for a good lifestyle doesn't mean it's not an improvement upon the reality they live in (and thus good). > and as for the increased harm I think I'm misunderstanding you, but are you suggesting a kid working in the worst sweatshop is being harmed more than if they were to starve to death? Even if you find this to be true, it's self-evident the families sending their children to work in that sweatshop believe the sweatshop is an improvement on their life. reply thecrash 19 hours agorootparentYou're reasoning about an economics thought experiment, not real situations. An exploitative industry in an underdeveloped region is not an idealized free market where individuals voluntarily choose based on enlightened self-interest between working or starving. As a starting point for understanding the nuance, consider what the owner might do with its profits. reply toolz 18 hours agorootparentThe owner very well may use the profits to attempt to keep the workers in a situation where they need to work in sweatshops (thus benefiting the party owning the sweatshop) That is still objectively better than starving to death and as such is still a net good for the poor family. Again, the answer to helping these people is to give them better opportunities. It should never even be a consideration for a good person to think about removing the voluntary sweatshop. A good person should think only about providing better opportunities such that the family can choose to not work at the sweatshop. If you think only about whether the sweatshop should be a decision for the family, then you're effectively saying you know better than the family about how to take care of them by limiting their choices. I trust self-interest of survival to make more meaningful decisions than benevolent parties completely disconnected from the outcomes using only their good intentions to make changes. reply JohnMakin 13 hours agorootparent> That is still objectively better than starving to death and as such is still a net good for the poor family.

No, the opposite. Once the sweatshop shuts down, the kid is forced into an even dire situation (starvation possibly, though more likely working an even worse/more deadly job than sweatshop work).

If they wished to not work at the sweatshop - they would stop working at the sweatshop. Whose opinion is more relevant here?

It’s not a choice if the alternative is literally starving to death. “Hi, give me your wallet or I’ll shoot you with this gun” isn’t considered a choice because we understand that the amount of pressure being applied removes agency. Since when do people complaining about sweatshop labor not want to empower sweatshop workers? Why else would they complain in your estimation? reply scotty79 19 hours agorootparentprevWhen poor people do idiotic job for you they don't develop their society, economy and environment. You are stealing their time, paying them scraps insufficient for them to purchase anything developmentally significant abroad. This is of no benefit to them. It's roughly equivalent of telling them to do nothing and paying them just enough that it's not worth doing anything else. It's a way of keeping them poor by not letting them explore opportunities for development. It's like paying the employee so low that they have to keep working for you because they can't afford the risk associated with attempting to switch jobs and long hours rob them of opportunities and motivation. reply toolz 15 hours agorootparent> When poor people do idiotic job for you they don't develop their society, economy and environment. Yes, they do. South Korea is a prime examples of this, e.g. Seoul peace market where the people got enough income to start focusing on unionizing. That market went from sweatshops to an internationally recognized quality market in just a few decades. Did the sweatshops suck? Of course they did, but the income took a people from trying to survive to realizing their worth and demanding better conditions while catapulting their economy into one of the most modern countries in the world in a matter of a few decades. reply Satam 20 hours agorootparentprevExploit?

(https://xkcd.com/2048/ panel 'House of Cards' comes to mind.) To distinguish between humans and LLMs, we don't even have to take advantage of that: we just have to take the context into the region where a naïve extrapolation of written human output diverges strongly from how humans actually respond.

I find the latter's challenge questions/images to be super annoying. 1. https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/ reply brucethemoose2 19 hours agoprevMy \"oh no\" moment was a vision model reading this perfectly: https://abadguide.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jh66.jpg?w=640 Not an OCR program or anything specialized, just some generic (vision) llm that can run on my desktop with a dumb prompt... reply barfbagginus 18 hours agoprevInteresting to note that a site like this could implement a rather dark and exploitive business model: 1. Service A lets a user pose a captcha to a target 2. Service B sells captcha solving service to bots, using service A as the solver backend 3. A service A user may become a victim of a bot that uses service B An interesting feature is that it can sell a single captcha solution to multiple bots. Let's call that the captcha multiplier (CM). Here the CM is 3, since the challenge is reused 3 times: 1. Bot X encounters challenge 1 2. Bot X poses challenge 1 to service B 3. Service A poses challenge 1 to bot Y 4. Bot Y poses challenge 1 to service B 5. Service A poses challenge 1 to person Z 6. Person Z solves challenge 1 7. Bots X, Y get solution 1, pay service B Here is what CM=10 looks like: 1. 100 humans use service A 2. 90 bots use service B 3. Only 10 actual humans solve captchas This woylr a captcha multiplier rate of 10. reply twodave 20 hours agoprevThis needs a hardware component as well as an independent authority of some kind before I’d trust it. Don’t just tell me, “We asked, and they told us they were human ;)” I want independent verification from an entity that knows _who_ the person is and can verify it, not just whether they passed a software-only test. reply Tabular-Iceberg 18 hours agoprevA simpler solution would be to just have them write a racial slur into a text field. reply brrrrrm 18 hours agoprevI predict knowing or caring about talking to a human via online anonymous chat is going to be a dated idea within five years. Might seem crazy today, but I think it’ll boil down to the conceptual equivalent of “is this text spell checked?” reply butlike 18 hours agoparentIf the online chat can look up my info, cross-ref databases, and get me going on my way in 10 minutes, I think it's a win. That being said, I would hope whomever is tasked with the job enjoys it, and that the human is freed up to do what they're passionate about, instead of taking my customer service request. reply digging 17 hours agoparentprevAs soon as chat bots are helpful, nobody will care. Most customer service right now is low quality and chat bots are currently making it worse so people are justifiably angry/worried. But that's a phenomenon of the present. reply justusthane 21 hours agoprevNeat idea! I like how you're repackaging an existing solution (hCaptcha) in an easy-to-use way for a specific use-case. I'd be curious to know if you (or if you know of others who) have used this in a real-world scenario, or if so far it's hypothetical. reply xaellison 21 hours agoparentIf anyone successfully uses this in a dating app context please leave a note reply geraldhh 20 hours agorootparentanecdotes about dating apps being overtaken by ai \"assistants\"? pls share! reply k7sune 20 hours agoprevAre we at a point where a computer can administer a Turing test better than a human? reply techietorontos 15 hours agoprevLove the concept and the execution. The landing page is crisp and clean. You know exactly what's happening, are provided clear instructions and it isn't hidden behind unnecessary authentication. Great work on the user flow. I wonder how one would incentivize the other side of this system -- the human to be checked -- to actually complete a check. Great work! reply Nifty3929 20 hours agoprevI think captchas have been mostly worthless for a while now, so human-detectors rely on other behavior signals instead, and are transparent to the end user. reply tim333 12 hours agoprevI thought the point when computers pass the Turing test would be some grand event but I guess maybe it'll just be when you can't tell if it's a human in customer service. reply jslakro 15 hours agoprevWe'd need to build a network of anonymous human checks. You verify that someone you know in person exists, but protected by an anonymous layer. The way you know some internet actor is human is connecting trust networks until the unknown person. reply techietorontos 15 hours agoparenta network... verified worked... anonymous validators... maybe we can call it squarelink technology? reply jslakro 14 hours agorootparentA descentralized would help for sure reply archsurface 19 hours agoprevI experienced this for the first time a couple of weeks ago - the uncanny valley of conversation. Some customer service bots do so little they're nothing more than a serial form, one textbox at a time. But My most recent encounter - I still can't decide whether it was human or trained software - a weird experience - very uncanny. reply rossdavidh 19 hours agoparentWhich means, if it was a human, they were probably acting robotic because they're just going through a script on their side. reply archsurface 19 hours agorootparentExactly - robotic human, or human robot. reply soared 19 hours agoprevCombined with private state tokens this could have some interesting uses https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/protections/pr... reply ramses0 19 hours agoprevNeeds a \"Put Shoe on Head\" and \"Banana for Scale\" options.

Why is that, Leon?” reply radarsat1 21 hours agoprevWhy does it ask for a name? reply justusthane 21 hours agoparentBecause you can send the same verification link to multiple people (e.g. a group), and then you can see each result on the admin page. reply jmor9751 21 hours agoparentprevThat way you can create a single link and know who has filled it out rather than have to create several. reply etothepii 21 hours agoprevI am definitely a human, and I think that only a human would have deliberately got so many of the answers wrong.

That sounds more like Google's captcha system. I've never seen Cloudflare Turnstile do this on any of my systems/browsers. reply nend 19 hours agoparentprevI pay for a vpn service and whenever I'm on it google makes me go through a ton of captchas before I can search. The first time it happened I assumed I must've kept getting one wrong, it made me go through 10 or so. The next time I just quit after 5 and started using bing. I suppose it's been the policy of a lot of big tech companies for a while, but it's just cheaper for them to lose x percent of users than it is to allow y percent of bots. reply lobito14 2 hours agorootparentUse the audio solution instead. reply bonton89 16 hours agorootparentprevSome of them just detect your IP and dump you in an endless loop. Sort of like a captcha shadow ban. I suppose they might let you through after 30 loops or something, but only a bot would last that long. reply archsurface 19 hours agoparentprev [–] Sometimes I suspect I'm caught in a loop, and just abandon. reply mikequinlan 18 hours agorootparentIf you can't pass the captcha, you need to ask yourself if you are really a human being or if you have just been programmed to believe that you are. reply throwanem 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a loop, it's just seeing how much free labeling it can shake out of you. reply _djo_ 19 hours agorootparentprevDepending on the implementation, that's intentional if you fail the check for whatever reason. It doesn't return an error status or page to allow what it thinks is the automated attacker from trying another approach, it just loops you through the process indefinitely. reply tomwheeler 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] I abandon as soon as I see Cloudflare, since my experience has shown that it seldom works correctly and ends up wasting my time anyway. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
