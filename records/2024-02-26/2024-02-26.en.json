TheJoeMan 18 hours agoI don’t have any direct experience to suggest, but for your funding model you seem to be mostly concerned that you wouldn’t make much money after releasing the work due to piracy. Perhaps you could consider the crowdfunding model instead, collect the money first! It also has the benefit of implicit voting for most-wanted projects. This model would be similar to the notorious Denuvo DRM cracker Empress, who is essentially the only person who can break this gaming anticheat. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_(cracker) . I will warn they have quite some drama about them, but the financials seem to be working. I would also consider what your work could be useful for / value proposition for others. The trimmed-down Wii consoles come to mind. Perhaps a small group of people would heavily value a netlist of their favorite circuit that they could recreate even smaller with more layers/modern techniques. reply chx 16 hours agoparentI strongly suspect a lot of people who could crack Denuvo simply do not want to. We've grown up. We got solid, well paying developer jobs. I do not want to even risk violating some law. It's been a hoot 1987-2004 but I have not opened IDA in two decades. That book is closed.

The way to use tools like this without ever written assembly is way harder than the way we had 10 years ago. They found other things to hack, things where we don't know anything about. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentIt might seem that way but a few observations. The number of people in total hacking away is much much larger now. So the absolute numbers are probably similar or more, while in relative terms you’re probably right. But my observation with a young hacker in the house is there’s a lot of appreciation for how the machine really works amongst many kids. The high level glossy stuff doesn’t appeal as much as ripping the cover off and poking memory locations. I think this shows up in the amazing prevalence of electronics hacking these days, low power computing, etc. This is the best time to be a hacker, the tools at all levels are amazing. But real nerds like you and I are just as rare as ever, and can’t resist ripping the lids off. reply HeWhoLurksLate 6 hours agorootparentprevI used Ghidra while I was in school to crack a copy of a CAD program- took forever but was totally worth it reply rasz 10 hours agorootparentprevThere has never been a time in history of this planet with more people possessing those capabilities. reply david_allison 6 hours agorootparentprevhttps://discord.gg/hKx3FJJgrV reply nikanj 2 hours agorootparentprevThe team that won Disobey’s CTF this year was very young. I don’t have a perfect eye for age, but I’d say the average age for the large group was around 20-25 reply metalcrow 9 hours agorootparentprevEven ignoring the legal stuff (which a lot of hackers don't care about), Denuvo is an unbelievably pain in the ass to crack. It's kinda unique per game, so you have to redo a lot of work every time, and your reward for like 6 months of your life is the newest Madden. Most games get Denuvo removed anyway in future patches since it costs money annually to license it, so why bother. reply chx 8 hours agorootparent> which a lot of hackers don't care about Well, yeah, there was a time for that. But, I can guess I can openly say this twenty years later, I was helping out one of the admins of the one of the largest warez sites in Central Europe and when that was raided (Operation Fastlink) -- police only found the proxies and couldn't find the owner so no one ever got indicted over this site -- I had a little chat with myself and, as I said above, closed that chapter of my life. That server was really something else: imagine a normal mid tower chassis PC of the era but stuffed with IDE cards and next to it several piles of hard drives separated by little pieces of wood so they didn't overheat from touching. By the end, if memory serves, it was multiple terabytes. reply troad 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is the correct answer. Denuvo isn't hard to crack in any exciting engineering sense, it's just incredibly tedious. With the amount of time required, anyone with those skills would be better off just getting a white hat security gig for a stable paycheck, and buying the game. reply rescbr 16 hours agorootparentprevYou’re not alone. A couple weeks ago I played around with a piece of software for my personal usage, and I certainly won’t release anything at all.

Ah, the simpler times at the University when I had the time and energy. reply Retr0id 13 hours agorootparentprevThese are the words of someone who has not tried to crack Denuvo. reply KennyBlanken 36 minutes agorootparentprevThe people who source pirated material (ie not the distribution groups, but the ones doing the actual cracking) are state-sponsored, not individuals doing it for fun. It's economic warfare; the purpose is to hurt profits while also giving economic benefit to the country doing the hacking, since its citizens won't have to pay for the software. Or did you think that it was some sort of wild coincidence that the vast majority of software piracy groups are Russian? reply billforsternz 12 hours agorootparentprevCD was CALL, 3E was LD A,imm but yes, I've forgotten most of them too. reply ckocagil 15 hours agorootparentprevAlso games became very affordable compared to the time period you mentioned. The number of games worth playing were much, much fewer. Not to mention the F2P or even open source games we have now. reply chx 15 hours agorootparentWell yes Diablo 2 was $50 when released http://web.archive.org/web/20000815052708/http://www.gamesto... which would be like $90 today adjusted for inflation. Diablo IV is $70 and people were raging how expensive that is. And Last Epoch is $35 and it seems like more fun than D IV. And of course Path Of Exile is free to play but you need to consider the price of a math degree totes required for that thing :D https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/wydq91/my_frie... And before someone posts the obligatory \"Still sane, Exile?\" I would like point out two things: a) I do have a math degree b) my Last Epoch Falconer is called TrappedInWraeclast. Sanity left the building, long ago :D reply hakfoo 5 hours agoparentprevI second the \"crowdfund a particular circuit\" process. There are plenty of projects where a new PCB for an old device would be desirable: * The vintage computers prone to capacitor/battery damage. There are a few Mac replacements, for example, but these are obviously hand-done labours of love. * Classic Hi-Fi involves a lot of 40 year old boards with failing materials (for example, early two-sided PCBs where the second layer was literally painted on) An accurate netlist might also help improve quality of schematic info that's sometimes ancient service manual scans that are nearly illegible. reply uSoldering 16 hours agoparentprevA bounty hunter-like crowdfunding system would probably be ideal. I could probably hack together some forum software with each thread being a different crowdfunding campaign. Thanks for the suggestion. reply punnerud 13 hours agoprevQuick creation of a Openseadragon viewer of the PCB from the article: https://ha-norge.no/images/pcb_highres/highres_pcb.html Full resolution on mobile phone without the need for downloadning 124MB JPG.

I would like to do this for boardscans going forward, but I don't have the hosting infrastructure. I know OSD can do overlays, it would be awesome to have the functionality of OpenBoardView as a webapp. reply andersa 9 hours agorootparentThrow the file on Cloudflare R2, no egress cost then. reply punnerud 12 hours agorootparentprevOnly the part that you zoom into is loaded in gradually higher resolution, that save bandwidth and less data to download. Send me an email (on my profile) and I can describe how to run the Python processing etc yourself. That way I believe you can host it. Had to make some adjustments because of the size of the original image. reply rasz 10 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.amigapcb.org reply tubetime 18 hours agoprevgreat project! i ran into it the other day and was impressed with the number of wires. i've been reverse engineering PCBs (mostly 2-4 layers) for a few years now and this is a part of the problem that i've been thinking about how to solve. best i can think of is a flying probe station cobbled together from 3d printers. basically you'd 1) scan the top and bottom of the board 2) generate a list of test points and pads 3) feed the coordinates into the flying probe system to generate the netlist the other way to handle multilayer boards (and the most accurate, imo, because it captures exact ground plane designs, guard traces, and structures like that) is the scan-sand-scan approach. you'll get exact artwork--unfortunately the dust it generates is pretty nasty stuff. reply uSoldering 18 hours agoparentI think with the Image->CAD data you could hack together something resembling a die-bond machine to automate the process. A flying probe would need two heads on both sides for full coverage of continuity, and some algorithms to probe multiple times with micro-offsets to deal with near-hits and bad connection hits. You could also monitor the probe heads for changes in capacitance to infer the quality of the probe hit. reply archi42 17 hours agorootparentI was also surprised not to see a flying probe system - I would expect this to be viable with modern 3D printer motion & control systems, but obviously this is highly non-trivial and has lots of mean details in the mechanical, electronics and software domains to solve. I did not think of a die-bond machine (I suppose it bonds a wire to each pad instead of you doing it by hand?), but of course that also makes sense. And at least the motion system is much simpler. A first step/experiment could be to automate creation of the gnd net. For that you only need a single tool head, meaning you can repurpose mostly any 3D printer motion system; for small increments, this could (later) happen during the die-bond process or become a precursor to a flying probe tool head. Of course I can not judge if that's a worthy investment of your time, or if you would enjoy building something like this ;) Anyway, the effort, skill and dexterity are amazing! Spending 3 weeks soldering 1917 tiny leads seems to be just the icing on the cake :) reply cinntaile 4 hours agoparentprevWhy do you reverse-engineer PCBs? What resources did you use to get started? reply MuffinFlavored 14 hours agoparentprevWhat can be done with the reverse-engineered data about the PCB? You have a working one, you reverse-engineer it, and then ultimately you can make your own? reply nyanpasu64 13 hours agorootparentPCB information is useful for, among other things, doing board-level diagnostics and repairs of broken electronics to avoid turning it into e-waste. reply MegaDeKay 5 hours agorootparentprevIt can be used to find connection points to signals that would otherwise be inaccessible or at least hard to get to. This has come in pretty handy for the latest wave of Nintendo Switch hacks like Picofly. The scan-sand-scan approach [0] has the advantage over this hack where you can do something like the \"kamikaze mod\" [1] on the OLED Switch since you know where stuff is, not just what is connected to what.

Nothing I can quickly find that is FOSS. It doesn't seem like this problem requires anything crazy, just traditional computer vision, but of course the devil is in the details. reply uSoldering 18 hours agorootparentThe issue I was concerned about was dealing with high-density interconnect microvias. This PCB is 10-layers with a core of 4 layers of normal vias, and 3 layers of lasered microvias on each side. Someone has actually done the sand and scan method on this board you can view here: https://balika011.hu/switch/lite/ PCBs can warp to various amounts post reflow, which can cause all sorts of problems with parallelism between your PCB and sanding surface. You would also be able to mitigate this type of attack by filling vias with conductive epoxy and plating over them, which is a well established process option in PCB fabrication. reply alright2565 17 hours agorootparentI expected scan-and-sand to be somewhat automated, but they're doing it by hand? Incredible! Might another way to resolve issues with the PCB dishing be to photograph the layers at a fraction of a layer height? So that in that way you have a lot more slices to work with, and you can digitally \"flatten\" the PCB? reply uSoldering 17 hours agorootparentMaking a machine to automagically remove a tiny bit of material and image the result over and over would be easy for me. The image processing to take the stack of 3D sequential images and automagically process them into a netlist is well beyond my programming capabilities. If anyone thinks they could do this, contact me. reply Keyframe 16 hours agorootparentNot gonna pretend I have the solution, but it sounds like most of the groundwork for that has been laid out in medical imagery already. CT scans, combined into volumes, identifying structures.. reply alright2565 12 hours agorootparentThat's what I was thinking, but now I'm pretty sure it doesn't even need crazy algorithms like that. 1. align the image stack. not trivial, but a common task. 2. take several cross-sections, in both dimensions, and have a human draw a line along a specific layer line 3. linearly interpolate these lines into a surface. 4. for each pixel in each output layer, set the value to layers[l + offset][x][y], where the offset was calculated in step 3. reply kayson 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are automated tools for generating a netlist from scanned IC layers (nm thick). They're proprietary trade secrets of course, but it's done all the time. reply nxobject 11 hours agoprevYour brute-force approach to finding hidden connections is simple but brilliant. I know a lot of current hobbyist reverse-engineering efforts have to go a lot further, are destructive and involve sanding things off layer-by-layer (resulting in 1:1 reconstructions, rather than just board views), but I'm sure that gets harder and harder the more PCB layers are involved, especially with cutting-edge consumer tech. reply kayson 18 hours agoprevWow I would've loved to have something like this. In the last few months I tried reverse engineering a Dell server motherboard (just the power supply interface) and a Lenovo ThinkCentre motherboard (PCI-E riser) and its such a pain to do by hand I mostly gave up after figuring out some basic connectivity. It's not really clear to me what your goal is here. It seems like this would make for a great open source project. Even if you want to make money from it, I think you can generate a lot of value from the process rather than the tools (which only you can really use anyway). You mentioned in a comment below automating the process further like a bonding machine. There's been a ton of work in this general space in a mechanical sense for 3D printers. I bet you could fairly easily adapt it for probing. reply uSoldering 17 hours agoparentThe original goal was to just turn an idea I thought was possible and figure out exactly how to execute it. The current goal is something like improve and iterate, while seeing what the market interest for something like this actually is. I think most of the value is in the imaging technology, and could easily be offered as a mail-in service. I can also bulk manufacture the extractor PCBs and sell them at a small markup, while open sourcing the rest. reply nativeit 13 hours agorootparentPeople like Ken Shirriff (who routinely posts here on HN, and collaborates with @CuriousMarc on YouTube) and Eric Schlaepfer (aka @TubeTime, published Open Circuits: The Inner Beauty of Electronic Components) would probably have some unique insights for this endeavor. reply mNovak 15 hours agoprevI'm wondering if a 'bed of nails' approach could be used to eliminate the mechanical difficulty of the flying probes? Basically a grid of (many thousands) probes at some resolution, connecting to essentially the same switch matrix backend you already have. In particular something like [1] might just have enough resolution. The 'probes' now are just pads on the sensing PCB. This converts it from a mechanical problem to a crazy high density PCB layout problem, which sounds like it'd be up your alley! Heat cure for the anisotropic layer is annoying, and might make it a single-use solution (but that's not bad if you're selling the boards!) Another 'just dumb enough to work' concept would be to take the board scans, and print a custom PCB of the same pad layout mirrored, and you can directly mount the two boards face-to-face. Basically a board level breakout, either to make the wire soldering easier, or better, again directly incorporate the netlisting hardware. [1] https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b5005076018/ reply ooterness 12 hours agoparentThis approach doesn't scale. Modern portable devices often have BGA packages with 0.5mm spacing. At this resolution, a relatively small 5x5 cm board would require at least 100x100 = 10k probes per side. Count increases quadratically with board size. Far easier is a \"flying probe\" machine [1] with a handful of probes that can be moved quickly. This option is mentioned in the article, but dismissed due to up-front cost. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_probe reply ginko 21 minutes agorootparentYou could multiplex the probe grid along rows and columns like pixels on an LCD screen. Would make the probing take a bit longer but you'd still save time since you don't need to manually hook stuff up. reply eternauta3k 15 hours agoparentprevI like the last one, but how do you connect the boards to each other? Solder balls? Just pressure? reply mNovak 10 hours agorootparentI'd just solder paste and reflow, like a large surface mount device. Challenging to get consistent no doubt, and the alignment would have to be very accurate (or have a few separate boards), but I think doable. Seems like you could largely automate a workflow for identifying pads in the scan and generating the mirror layout, with simple routing to some kind of standardized interface for the probe lines. reply flutas 13 hours agorootparentprevMight be able to find pogo pins that small. That would be my best idea (if they're available). reply dclowd9901 13 hours agoparentprevHad this same idea as I was reading the article. You could really automate a lot of the probing. reply eichin 11 hours agoprevThis is amazing (particular the hand soldering - I love the genre of \"this is impossible, you'd need to do this thing thousands of times\" \"so I did the thing thousands of times\" persistence) but I wonder, now that homebrew pick-and-place is starting to become a thing, is there any practical way to take advantage of that? I pick-and-place tip that was vaguely like a wire-wrap tool seems almost plausible. Or is this more like bond-wires on chips and needs an order of magnitude more precision? reply uSoldering 10 hours agoparentFor this PCB, the smallest targets are about 0.2mm in diameter. In terms of precision robotics, this is very manageable. A robotic soldering iron, or even a laser soldering system, with a wire feeder and cutter could be used to make something like a rudimentary die-bonder, that simply solders the wires to the correct pads. My background in process engineering made me lean towards a figuring out very manual process that could be automated, instead of figuring out a highly automated process. reply xt00 11 hours agoprevIf you / somebody is doing the sand and scan or xray/CT method (which you could pay somebody to do rather than buying a CT machine), then you can create a gerber -- then manually clean it up. Then you have a dangling set of nets that are only separated by layers. You can then infer connectivity from the gerbers on layer to layer manually again to create a reduced set of nets by the shape / visual cues of what the vias look like. That would be far easier than soldering wires to every ball on both sides of a board -- and a netlist doesn't automatically generate a schematic for you, you need to still do a chunk of work to actually create the schematic. To be honest, a netlist is not actually all that useful unless your goal is to attempt to create a full schematic out of the board. For reverse engineering efforts, you would likely focus on one chip and just manually follow each trace for the thing you care about and draw up a schematic manually for that. In most cases you would likely spend like 1 day after you got the scans back building up a schematic for the key chips of interest. For anything that is a bit questionable about if a via actually connects or not, then you would just manually ohm that out. Anyway, I guess if you like soldering and are just doing something for fun, then sure do this method. Otherwise, there are way better approaches than this. reply newsclues 16 hours agoprevI feel like contacting Louis rossman from YouTube for an interview on right to repair etc would be great! reply indrora 14 hours agoparentNot OP, but the less I encounter of Lous \"I should be allowed to beat my kids\" Rossmann, the better I've become. Rossmann is the RMS of the right to repair movement. A lot of ideas that align with the overall goal but a terrible figurehead because he has a fairly myopic view of right-to-repair scene at this point, coupled with some Yikes opinions outside of it. He has actively held back some RtR folks simply because of his crass comments about women & minorities, but also because he doesn't think the issue extends to some things (like dishwashers, which he's said a few times on stream are \"simple shit nobody needs boardview for\"). Similarly like RMS, he's made comments (like the one I alluded to before) where he has explained (while very drunk on a live stream) that he has some beliefs that don't... always align well with the status quo in terms of basic human decency. reply atlas_hugged 13 hours agorootparentYou’re the first comment I’ve seen that has the same view as me. I don’t know why so many people worship that guy. Same with RMS. Both of those dudes give me the creeps even though I often hold the same or similar views on their areas of specialization.

People looking for character flaws and projecting them onto the entire person. There is a guy on \"my side\" who acts as if people like me are extreme radicals from the \"other side\" and you sound like you want to ride this slope downhill as hard as possible. At some point you will only focus on the bad things these people have done, after all you're not watching his videos, just hearing it from biased third parties and you no longer care if it has any semblance of truth to it or not. I do not worship this guy. I don't even watch his videos. I probably don't even remember what he looks like. reply newsclues 13 hours agorootparentprevDunno about that but I do know that RMS made a huge contribution to open source and Rossman seems to be doing the same for right to repair. I’m happy that people are doing good work even if they have shitty opinions or are even shitty humans.

I’m not defending shitty behaviour, I’m not throwing out the baby with the bath water. reply imtringued 58 minutes agorootparentprevDo you really think this is an honest characterization? If Louis Rossman commits a crime you can just send him to prison. The fact that he isn't in prison indicates that you are trying to push this in a specific direction by thinking of the worst possible crime and pretending the situations are remotely similar. reply snvzz 8 hours agorootparentprev>He's made comments where he has explained (while very drunk on a live stream) that he has some beliefs that don't... always align well with the status quo in terms of basic human decency. Others will definitely have views on topics which aren't always going to agree with your own. The more you know somebody, the more likely you'll find a difference of opinions that annoys you somewhat. This is highly likely to happen with views on politics or religion. The average person, however, can live with having differences just fine. Only those with severe mental issues such as narcissism will make it an actual problem, for themselves and others. reply blubbity 16 hours agoprevThis is completely brilliant! If the painful part is the soldering, and the novel part is the imaging, there is definitely opportunity here. Seems like an opportunity to create a dirt cheap flying probe based off an ender3 3D printer. This is possibly a perfect situation where smart software can make up for the shortcomings of cheap hardware. reply userbinator 9 hours agoprevPCB RE services are pretty cheap in China and the far East, and they use a lot of automation to do the work of creating the netlist from the pad locations --- the recognition and probing is automated. reply mkoryak 17 hours agoprevDo you have a full time job?

But to do that, you'd need a CT scan of the boards in the CT scanner... reply bsder 12 hours agorootparentNot really.

The problem is that for a lot of chips there aren't any datasheets available. Sure, something like a memory bus is trivial to trace, but how are you going to reason about Unknown Pin #464 coming from Unlabeled IC #4 which seems to randomly have a 500ms pulse on bootup and every few minutes afterwards? reply crote 16 hours agoprevIt's definitely a really cool project, but this doesn't really look like something that would scale. While a boardview is nice to have, investing what looks like hundreds of hours per board simply isn't viable for the vast majority of projects - especially the hobbyist market you seem to be targeting. You can get something similar-ish done quite cheaply in China: a digital copy of a 2-layer board is only $150[0], and turning that into a netlist shouldn't be too difficult. I expect multi-layer boards to be quite a bit more expensive, but still nothing like this process. Heck, even for a plain netlist it'd probably be orders of magnitude easier to DIY your own flying-probe machine. All the hardware for 3D printers is widely available, after all.

It had been a successful year: a new plant had opened, and the company had doubled the amount of squid that it exported to the United States. The party, according to videos posted on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, featured singers, instrumentalists, dancers, fireworks, and strobe lights. One aspect of the company’s success seems to have been its use of North Korean workers, who are sent by their government to work in Chinese factories, in conditions of captivity, to earn money for the state. A seafood trader who does business with Jinhui recently estimated that it employed between fifty and seventy North Koreans. Videos posted by a company representative show machines labelled in Korean, and workers with North Korean accents explaining how to clean squid. At the party, the company played songs that are popular in Pyongyang, including “People Bring Glory to Our Party” (written by North Korea’s 1989 poet laureate) and “We Will Go to Mt. Paektu” (a reference to the widely mythologized birthplace of Kim Jong Il). Performers wore North Korean colors, and the country’s flag billowed behind them; in the audience, dozens of workers held miniature flags. A party held by Donggang Jinhui Foodstuff, a seafood-processing company in Dandong, China, last year, included what appeared to be North Korean workers.Source: Douyin Drone footage played at the event showed off Jinhui’s twenty-one-acre, fenced-in compound, which has processing and cold-storage facilities and what appears to be a seven-floor dormitory for workers. The company touted a wide array of Western certifications from organizations that claim to check workplaces for labor violations, including the use of North Korean workers. When videos of the party were posted online, a commenter—presumably befuddled, because using these workers violates U.N. sanctions—asked, “Aren’t you prohibited from filming this?” Like Jinhui, many companies in China rely on a vast program of forced labor from North Korea. (Jinhui did not respond to requests for comment.) The program is run by various entities in the North Korean government, including a secretive agency called Room 39, which oversees activities such as money laundering and cyberattacks, and which funds the country’s nuclear- and ballistic-missile programs. (The agency is so named, according to some defectors, because it is based in the ninth room on the third floor of the Korean Workers’ Party headquarters.) Such labor transfers are not new. In 2012, North Korea sent some forty thousand workers to China. A portion of their salaries was taken by the state, providing a vital source of foreign currency for Party officials: at the time, a Seoul-based think tank estimated that the country made as much as $2.3 billion a year through the program. Since then, North Koreans have been sent to Russia, Poland, Qatar, Uruguay, and Mali. This piece was published in collaboration with the Outlaw Ocean Project. In 2017, after North Korea tested a series of nuclear and ballistic weapons, the United Nations imposed sanctions that prohibit foreign companies from using North Korean workers. The U.S. passed a law that established a “rebuttable presumption” categorizing work by North Koreans as forced labor unless proven otherwise, and levying fines on companies that import goods tied to these workers. China is supposed to enforce the sanctions in a similar manner. Nevertheless, according to State Department estimates, there are currently as many as a hundred thousand North Koreans working in the country. Many work at construction companies, textile factories, and software firms. Some also process seafood. In 2022, according to Chinese officials running pandemic quarantines, there were some eighty thousand North Koreans just in Dandong, a hub of the seafood industry. Last year, I set out with a team of researchers to document this phenomenon. We reviewed leaked government documents, promotional materials, satellite imagery, online forums, and local news reports. We watched hundreds of cell-phone videos published on social-media sites. In some, the presence of North Koreans was explicit. Others were examined by experts to detect North Korean accents, language usage, and other cultural markers. Reporting in China is tightly restricted for Western reporters. But we hired Chinese investigators to visit factories and record footage of production lines. I also secretly sent interview questions, through another group of investigators and their contacts, to two dozen North Koreans—twenty workers and four managers—who had recently spent time in Chinese factories. Their anonymous responses were transcribed and sent back to me. The workers, all of whom are women, described conditions of confinement and violence at the plants. Workers are held in compounds, sometimes behind barbed wire, under the watch of security agents. Many work gruelling shifts and get at most one day off a month. Several described being beaten by the managers sent by North Korea to watch them. “It was like prison for me,” one woman said. “At first, I almost vomited at how bad it was, and, just when I got used to it, the supervisors would tell us to shut up, and curse if we talked.” Many described enduring sexual assault at the hands of their managers. “They would say I’m fuckable and then suddenly grab my body and grope my breasts and put their dirty mouth on mine and be disgusting,” a woman who did product transport at a plant in the city of Dalian said. Another, who worked at Jinhui, said, “The worst and saddest moment was when I was forced to have sexual relations when we were brought to a party with alcohol.” The workers described being kept at the factories against their will, and being threatened with severe punishment if they tried to escape. A woman who was at a factory called Dalian Haiqing Food for more than four years said, “It’s often emphasized that, if you are caught running away, you will be killed without a trace.” In all, I identified fifteen seafood-processing plants that together seem to have used more than a thousand North Korean workers since 2017. China officially denies that North Korean laborers are in the country. But their presence is an open secret. “They are easy to distinguish,” a Dandong native wrote in a comment on Bilibili, a video-sharing site. “They all wear uniform clothes, have a leader, and follow orders.” Often, footage of the workers ends up online. In a video from a plant called Dandong Yuanyi Refined Seafoods, a dozen women perform a synchronized dance in front of a mural commemorating Youth Day, a North Korean holiday. The video features a North Korean flag emoji and the caption “Beautiful little women from North Korea in Donggang’s cold-storage facility.” (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Remco Breuker, a North Korea specialist at Leiden University, in the Netherlands, told me, “Hundreds of thousands of North Korean workers have for decades slaved away in China and elsewhere, enriching their leader and his party while facing unconscionable abuse.” An investigator visited a plant called Donggang Haimeng Foodstuff, last year, and found a North Korean manager sitting at a wooden desk with two miniature flags, one Chinese and one North Korean. The walls around the desk were mostly bare except for two portraits of the past North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Portions of this image have been blurred to protect sources.Photograph from The Outlaw Ocean Project In late 2023, an investigator hired by my team visited a Chinese plant called Donggang Xinxin Foodstuff. He found hundreds of North Korean women working under a red banner that read, in Korean, “Let’s carry out the resolution of the 8th Congress of the Workers’ Party.” (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Soon afterward, the investigator visited a nearby plant called Donggang Haimeng Foodstuff, and found a North Korean manager sitting at a wooden desk with two miniature flags, one Chinese and one North Korean. The walls around the desk were mostly bare except for two portraits of the past North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The manager took our investigator to the workers’ cafeteria to eat a North Korean cold-noodle dish called naengmyeon, and then gave him a tour of the processing floor. Several hundred North Korean women dressed in red uniforms, plastic aprons, and white rubber boots stood shoulder to shoulder at long metal tables under harsh lights, hunched over plastic baskets of seafood, slicing and sorting products by hand. “They work hard,” the manager said. The factory has exported thousands of tons of fish to companies that supply major U.S. retailers, including Walmart and ShopRite. (A spokesperson for Donggang Haimeng said that it does not hire North Korean workers.) At times, China aggressively conceals the existence of the program. Alexander Dukalskis, a political-science professor at University College Dublin, said that workers have a hard time making their conditions known. “They’re in a country where they may not speak the language, are under surveillance, usually living collectively, and have no experience in contacting journalists,” he said. In late November, after my team’s investigators visited several plants, authorities distributed pamphlets on the country’s anti-espionage laws. Local officials announced that people who try “to contact North Korean workers, or to approach the workplaces of North Korean workers, will be treated as engaging in espionage activities that endanger national security, and will be punished severely.” They also warned that people who were found to be working in connection with foreign media outlets would face consequences under the Anti-Espionage Act. The border between China and North Korea. DANDONG, A CITY OF MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE, sits on the Yalu River, just over the border from North Korea. The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge links Dandong to the North Korean city of Sinuiju. A second bridge, bombed during the Korean War, still extends partway across the river, and serves as a platform from which Chinese residents can view the North Koreans living six hundred yards away. The Friendship Bridge is one of the Hermit Kingdom’s few gateways to the world. Some trade with North Korea is allowed under U.N. sanctions, and nearly seventy per cent of the goods exchanged between that country and China travel across this bridge. At least one department store in Dandong keeps a list of products preferred by North Korean customers. Shops sell North Korean ginseng, beer, and “7.27” cigarettes, named for the date on which the armistice ending the Korean War was signed. The city is home to a museum about the conflict, officially called the Memorial Hall of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. On boat tours, Chinese tourists purchase bags of biscuits to toss to children on the North Korean side of the river. Government officials carefully select workers to send to China, screening them for their political loyalties to reduce the risk of defections. To qualify, a person must generally have a job at a North Korean company and a positive evaluation from a local Party official. “These checks start at the neighborhood,” Breuker said. Candidates who have family in China, or a relative who has already defected, can be disqualified. For some positions, applicants under twenty-seven years of age who are unmarried must have living parents, who can be punished if they try to defect, according to a report from the South Korean government; applicants over twenty-seven must be married. North Korean authorities even select for height: the country’s population is chronically malnourished, and the state prefers candidates who are taller than five feet one, to avoid the official embarrassment of being represented abroad by short people. Once selected, applicants go through pre-departure training, which can last a year and often includes government-run classes covering everything from Chinese customs and etiquette to “enemy operations” and the activities of other countries’ intelligence agencies. (The North Korean government did not respond to requests for comment.) The governments of both countries coördinate to place workers, most of whom are women, with seafood companies. The logistics are often handled by local Chinese recruitment agencies, and advertisements can be found online. A video posted on Douyin this past September announced the availability of twenty-five hundred North Koreans, and a commenter asked if they could be sent to seafood factories. A post on a forum advertised five thousand workers; a commenter asked if any spoke Mandarin, and the poster replied, “There is a team leader, management, and an interpreter.” A company called Jinuo Human Resources posted, “I am a human-resources company coöperating with the embassy, and currently have a large number of regular North Korean workers.” Several people expressed interest. (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Jobs in China are coveted in North Korea, because they often come with contracts promising salaries of around two hundred and seventy dollars a month. (Similar work in North Korea pays just three dollars a month.) But the jobs come with hidden costs. Workers usually sign two- or three-year contracts. When they arrive in China, managers confiscate their passports. Inside the factories, North Korean workers wear different uniforms than Chinese workers. “Without this, we couldn’t tell if one disappeared,” a manager said. Shifts run as long as sixteen hours. If workers attempt to escape, or complain to people outside the plants, their families at home can face reprisals. One seafood worker described how managers cursed at her and flicked cigarette butts. “I felt bad, and I wanted to fight them, but I had to endure,” she said. “That was when I was sad.” The Daily Sign up to receive the best of The New Yorker, every day, in your in-box, plus occasional news alerts.

At seafood plants, the women sleep in bunk beds in locked dormitories, sometimes thirty to a room. One worker, who spent four years processing clams in Dandong, estimated that more than sixty per cent of her co-workers suffered from depression. “We regretted coming to China but couldn’t go back empty-handed,” she said. Workers are forbidden to tune in to local TV or radio. They are sometimes allowed to leave factory grounds—say, to go shopping—but generally in groups of no more than three, and accompanied by a minder. Mail is scrutinized by North Korean security agents who also “surveil the daily life and report back with official reports,” one manager said. Sometimes the women are allowed to socialize. In a video titled “North Korean beauties working in China play volleyball,” posted in 2022, women in blue-and-white uniforms exercise on the grounds of the Dandong Omeca Food seafood plant. (The company that owns the plant did not respond to requests for comment.) A commenter wrote, “The joy of poverty. That’s just how it is.” Factories typically give the women’s money to their managers, who take cuts for themselves and the government, and hold on to the rest until the workers’ terms in China end. Kim Jieun, a North Korean defector who now works for Radio Free Asia, said that companies tell workers their money is safer this way, because it could be stolen in the dormitories. But, in the end, workers often see less than ten per cent of their promised salary. One contract that I reviewed stipulated that around forty dollars would be deducted each month by the state to pay for food. More is sometimes deducted for electricity, housing, heat, water, insurance, and “loyalty” payments to the state. Managers also hold on to wages to discourage defections. The women have been warned, Kim added, that if they try to defect “they will be immediately caught by Chinese CCTV cameras installed everywhere.” This past October, Chinese authorities repatriated around six hundred North Korean defectors. “China does not recognize North Korean defectors as refugees,” Edward Howell, who teaches politics at Oxford University, told me. “If they are caught by Chinese authorities, they will be forcibly returned to the D.P.R.K., where they face harsh punishment in labor camps.” Chinese companies have significant incentives to use North Korean workers. They’re typically paid only a quarter of what local employees earn. And they are generally excluded from mandatory social-welfare programs (regarding retirement, medical treatment, work-related injury, and maternity), which further reduces costs. In 2017, Dandong’s Commerce Bureau announced a plan to create a cluster of garment factories that would use North Korean labor. The bureau’s Web site noted that all such workers undergo political screenings to make sure they are “rooted, red, and upright.” “The discipline among the workers is extremely strong,” it added. “There are no instances of absenteeism or insubordination toward leadership, and there are no occurrences of feigning illness or delaying work.” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions for this piece, but last year the Chinese Ambassador to the U.N. wrote that China has abided by sanctions even though it has sustained “great losses” as a result. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently said that China and North Korea have “enjoyed long-standing friendly ties,” adding, “The United States needs to draw lessons, correct course, step up to its responsibility, stop heightening the pressure and sanctions, stop military deterrence, and take effective steps to resume meaningful dialogue.” North Koreans face difficult circumstances across industries. In January of this year, more than two thousand workers rioted in Jilin Province, breaking sewing machines and kitchen utensils, when they learned that their wages would be withheld. Many North Koreans—perhaps thousands—work in Russian logging, in brutal winter weather without proper clothing. Hundreds have been found working in the Russian construction industry; some lived in shipping containers or in the basements of buildings under construction, because better accommodations were not provided. One recounted working shifts that lasted from 7:30 a.m. to 3 a.m. In preparation for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, held in Russia and Qatar, thousands of North Koreans were sent to build stadiums and luxury apartments. A subcontractor who worked alongside the North Koreans in Russia told the Guardian that they lived in cramped spaces, with as many as eight people packed into a trailer, in an atmosphere of fear and abuse like “prisoners of war.” At Donggang Haimeng, last year, several hundred workers, many of whom were North Korean, stood shoulder to shoulder at long metal tables under harsh lights. Dressed in head-to-toe red uniforms, plastic aprons, and white rain boots, they hunched over baskets of seafood, slicing and sorting products by hand.Source: The Outlaw Ocean Project ALTHOUGH IT’S ILLEGAL in the U.S. to import goods made with North Korean labor, the law can be difficult to enforce. Some eighty per cent of seafood consumed in America, for example, is imported, and much of it comes from China through opaque supply chains. To trace the importation of seafood from factories that appear to be using North Korean labor, my team reviewed trade data, shipping contracts, and the codes that are stamped on seafood packages to monitor food safety. We found that, since 2017, ten of these plants have together shipped more than a hundred and twenty thousand tons of seafood to more than seventy American importers, which supplied grocery stores including Walmart, Giant, ShopRite, and the online grocer Weee! The seafood from these importers also ended up at major restaurant chains, like McDonald’s, and with Sysco, the largest food distributor in the world, which supplies almost half a million restaurants, as well as the cafeterias on American military bases, in public schools, and for the U.S. Congress. (Walmart, Weee!, and McDonald’s did not respond to requests for comment. Giant’s parent company, Ahold Delhaize, and ShopRite’s parent company, Wakefern, said their suppliers claimed that they currently do not source from the Chinese plant in question, and added that audit reports showed no evidence of forced labor.) Two of the plants that investigators from my team visited—Dandong Galicia Seafood and Dalian Haiqing Food—had an estimated fifty to seventy North Korean workers apiece. One worker who has been employed at Galicia said that the managers are “so stingy with money that they don’t allow us to get proper medical treatment even when we are sick.” Galicia and Haiqing have shipped roughly a hundred thousand tons of seafood to American importers since 2017, and Haiqing also shipped to an importer that supplies the cafeterias of the European Parliament. (Dalian Haiqing Food said that it “does not employ overseas North Korean workers.” Dandong Galicia Seafood did not respond to requests for comment. One of the U.S. importers tied to Haiqing, Trident Seafoods, said that audits “found no evidence or even suspicion” of North Korean labor at the plant. Several companies, including Trident, High Liner, and Sysco, said that they would sever ties with the plant while they conducted their own investigations. A spokesperson for the European Parliament said that its food contractor did not supply seafood from the plant.) Breuker, from Leiden University, told me that American customers quietly benefit from this arrangement. “This labor-transfer system is for North Korea and China as economically successful as it is morally reprehensible,” he said. “It’s also a boon for the West because of the cheap goods we get as a result.” North Korea doesn’t just export seafood workers; it also exports fish—another means by which the government secures foreign currency. Importing North Korean seafood is forbidden by U.N. sanctions, but it also tends to be inexpensive, which encourages companies to skirt the rules. Sometimes Chinese fishing companies pay the North Korean government for illegal licenses to fish in North Korea’s waters. Sometimes they buy fish from other boats at sea: a letter from a North Korean, leaked in 2022, proposed selling ten thousand tons of squid to a Chinese company in return for more than eighteen million dollars and five hundred tons of diesel fuel. Sometimes the seafood is trucked over the border. This trade is poorly hidden. In October, a Chinese man who said his last name was Cui posted a video on Douyin advertising crabs from North Korea. When someone commented, “The goods can’t be shipped,” Cui responded with laughing emojis. In other videos, he explained that he operated a processing plant in North Korea, and gave information on the timing of shipments that he planned to send across the border. When I contacted Cui, he said that he had stopped importing North Korean seafood in 2016 (though the videos were actually from last year), and added, “It’s none of your business, and I don’t care who you are.” My team found that seafood from North Korea was imported by several American distributors, including HF Foods, which supplies more than fifteen thousand Asian restaurants in the U.S. (HF Foods did not respond to requests for comment.) Chinese companies often claim that they are in compliance with labor laws because they have passed “social audits,” which are conducted by firms that inspect worksites for abuses. But half the Chinese plants that we found using North Korean workers have certifications from the Marine Stewardship Council, which is based in the U.K. and sets standards for granting sustainability certifications, but only to companies that have also passed social audits or other labor assessments. (Jackie Marks, an M.S.C. spokesperson, told me that these social audits are conducted by a third party, and that “We make no claims about setting standards on labor.”) Last year, one of my team’s investigators visited a seafood-processing plant in northeastern China called Dandong Taifeng Foodstuff. The company has been designated a “national brand,” a status reserved for the country’s most successful companies, and supplies thousands of tons of seafood to grocery stores in the U.S. and elsewhere. At the plant, our investigator was given a tour by a North Korean manager. On the factory floor, which was lit by bright fluorescent bulbs, more than a hundred and fifty North Korean women, most of them under thirty-five years old, wore head-to-toe white protective clothing, plastic aprons, white rubber boots, and red gloves that went up to their elbows. They stood with their heads down, moving red, yellow, and blue plastic bins of seafood. Water puddled at their feet. “Quick, quick,” one woman said to the other members of her small group. (Taifeng did not respond to requests for comment.) Just weeks after that visit, the plant was recertified by the Marine Stewardship Council. Marcus Noland, who works at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, of social audits within the seafood industry, “The basic stance appears to be ‘See no evil.’ ” Skepticism of such audits is growing. In 2021, the U.S. State Department said that social audits in China are generally inadequate for identifying forced labor, in part because auditors rely on government translators and rarely speak directly to workers. Auditors can be reluctant to anger the companies that have hired them, and workers face reprisals for reporting abuses. This past November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection advised American companies that a credible assessment would require an “unannounced independent, third-party audit” and “interviews completed in native language.” Liana Foxvog, who works at a nonprofit called the Worker Rights Consortium, argues that assessments should involve other checks too, including off-site worker interviews. But she noted that most audits in China fall short even of C.B.P.’s standards. Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington, D.C., who helped draft the American law that banned goods produced with North Korean labor, argues that the government is not doing enough to enforce it. “The U.S. government will need to put more pressure on American companies, and those companies need to be more diligent about their suppliers and their supply chains, or face stricter sanctions,” he said. Chris Smith, a Republican congressman from New Jersey and a specialist on China, noted that social audits “create a Potemkin village.” He added, “The consequence is that millions of dollars, even federal dollars, are going to Chinese plants using North Korean workers, and that money then goes right into the hands of Kim Jong Un’s regime, which uses the money to arm our adversaries and repress its own people.” LATE LAST YEAR, when I set out to contact North Koreans who had been sent to China, I ran into significant obstacles. Western journalists are barred from entering North Korea, and citizens of the country are strictly prohibited from talking freely to reporters. I hired a team of investigators in South Korea who employ contacts in North Korea to get information out of the country for local and Western news outlets—for example, about food shortages, power outages, or the rise of anti-government graffiti. The investigators compiled a list of two dozen North Koreans who had been dispatched to a half-dozen different Chinese factories, most of whom had since returned home. The investigators’ contacts then met with these workers in secret, one-on-one, so that the workers wouldn’t know one another’s identity. The meetings usually occurred in open fields, or on the street, where it’s harder for security agents to conduct surveillance. The workers were told that their responses would be shared publicly by an American journalism outlet. They faced considerable risk speaking out; experts told me that, if they were caught, they could be executed, and their families put in prison camps. But they agreed to talk because they believe that it is important for the rest of the world to know what happens to workers who are sent to China. The North Korean contacts transcribed their answers by hand, and then took photos of the completed questionnaires and sent them, using encrypted phones, to the investigators, who sent them to me. North Koreans who are still in China were interviewed in a similar fashion. Because of these layers of protection, it is, of course, impossible to fully verify the content of the interviews. But the responses were reviewed by experts to make sure that they are consistent with what is broadly known about the work-transfer program, and in line with interviews given by North Korean defectors. (Recently, the investigators checked in on the interviewers and interviewees, and everyone was safe.) Transcribed interviews with North Korean workers. Portions have been blurred to protect sources. “At first, I almost vomited at how bad it was, and, just when I got used to it, the supervisors would tell us to shut up, and curse if we talked. ” “They called me in as if something happened in the room, and then coerced me into sex. They threatened me that, if I don’t comply, then they will send me back, or they will take out money from my living expenses. ” “Earning money was good, but I kept thinking about the sexual assault and it was driving me crazy. ” “They would say I’m fuckable and then suddenly grab my body and grope my breasts and put their dirty mouth on mine and be disgusting. ” “Sixty to seventy per cent are depressed. We regretted coming to China but couldn’t go back empty-handed. ” In their answers, the workers described crushing loneliness. The work was arduous, the factories smelled, and violence was common. “They kicked us and treated us as subhuman,” the worker who processed clams in Dandong said. Asked if they could recount any happy moments, most said that there had been none. A few said that they felt relieved when they returned home and got some of their pay. “I was happy when the money wasn’t all taken out,” the woman who did product transport in Dalian said. One woman said that her experience at a Chinese plant made her feel like she “wanted to die.” Another said that she often felt tired and upset while she was working, but kept those thoughts to herself to avoid reprisals. “It was lonely,” she said. “I hated the military-like communal life.” The most striking pattern was the women’s description of sexual abuse. Of twenty workers, seventeen said that they had been sexually assaulted by their North Korean managers. They described a range of tactics used to coerce them into having sex. Some managers pretended to wipe something from their uniforms, only to grope them. Some called them into their offices as if there were an emergency, then demanded sex. Others asked them to serve alcohol at a weekend party, then assaulted them there. “When they drank, they touched my body everywhere like playing with toys,” a woman said. The woman who did product transport in Dalian said, “When they suddenly put their mouths to mine, I wanted to throw up.” If the women didn’t comply, the managers could become violent. The worker who was at Haiqing for more than four years said, of her manager, “When he doesn’t get his way sexually, he gets angry and kicks me. . . . He calls me a ‘fucking bitch.’ ” Three of the women said that their managers had forced workers into prostitution. “Whenever they can, they flirt with us to the point of nausea and force us to have sex for money, and it’s even worse if you’re pretty,” another worker at Haiqing said. The worker from Jinhui noted, “Even when there was no work during the pandemic, the state demanded foreign-currency funds out of loyalty, so managers forced workers to sell their bodies.” The worker who spent more than four years at Haiqing said, of the managers, “They forced virgin workers into prostitution, claiming that they had to meet state-set quotas.” The pandemic made life more difficult for many of the women. When China closed its borders, some found themselves trapped far from home. Often, their workplaces shut down, and they lost their incomes. North Korean workers sometimes pay bribes to government officials to secure posts in China, and, during the pandemic, many borrowed these funds from loan sharks. The loans, typically between two and three thousand dollars, came with high interest rates. Because of work stoppages in China, North Korean workers were unable to pay back their loans, and loan sharks sent thugs to their relatives’ homes to intimidate them. Some of their families had to sell their houses to settle the debts. In 2023, according to Radio Free Asia, two North Korean women at textile plants killed themselves. The worker who told me that she wanted to die said that such deaths are often kept hidden. “If someone dies from suicide, then the manager is responsible, so they keep it under wraps to keep it from being leaked to other workers or Chinese people,” she said. This past year, pandemic restrictions were lifted, and the border between China and North Korea reopened. In August, some three hundred North Korean workers boarded ten buses in Dandong to go back home. Police officers lined up around the buses to prevent defections. In photos and a video of the event, some of the women can be seen hurriedly preparing to load large suitcases onto a neon-green bus, then riding away across the Friendship Bridge. In September, another three hundred boarded a passenger train to Sinuiju, and two hundred were repatriated by plane. Workers who return face intense questioning by officials. “They asked about every single thing that happened every day from morning to evening in China, about other workers, supervisors, and agents,” the worker who processed clams in Dandong explained. As 2023 ended, the North Korean government began planning to dispatch its next wave of workers. In the past couple of years, according to reporting by Hyemin Son, a North Korean defector who works for Radio Free Asia, labor brokers have requested that Chinese companies pay a large advance; they were being asked to pay ahead of time, one broker told her, because “Chinese companies cannot operate without North Korean manpower.” Some North Korean workers have yet to go home. One woman said that she has spent the past several years gutting fish at a processing plant in Dalian. She described working late into the night and getting sores in her mouth from stress and exhaustion. In the questionnaire, I had asked about the worst part of her job, and she said, “When I am forced to have sex.” She also described a sense of imprisonment that felt suffocating. “If you show even the slightest attitude, they will treat you like an insect,” she said. “Living a life where we can’t see the outside world as we please is so difficult that it’s killing us.” ♦ This piece was produced with contributions from Joe Galvin, Maya Martin, Susan Ryan, Jake Conley, Austin Brush, and Daniel Murphy.

Whether nations want to redirect people's attention away from problems at home, or people want/let their attention redirected, they'll focus more on the crap happening in another country. An enemy or an issue are always created somewhere far away, something as contrasting as possible with the apparent situation at home. Take the example of prisons and prison labor in the US. People know millions are imprisoned at home, many forced to work, with inhumane conditions. But that's a bitter taste when they know it's at home, that it's a democratic country, that this could be changed but isn't. So it's made better by looking at how much worse it could be. It's an easy mental and moral release and people need one especially when there's a discrepancy between the image they have of their country and the reality. The bigger the discrepancy, the easier and more attractive it is to look at the speck/plank in someone else's eye.

She went on to tell me that her brother-in-law's factory was not unique.

I heard that there is political repression there, but despite the sanctions, not starvation or even economic hardship. The other two countries, Cuba and North Korea, are still communist. North Korea is not doing well. And Cuba is hanging from a thread; citizens survive thanks to direct support from their expats to the families at home, but the country’s infrastructure is ruined.

Socialism is not evil, it's even benevolent: but it's flawed because it ignore 50% of human nature. Better let people deal with their greed in a monitored sandbox that averages out excesses. And that is never called socialism, since it derives too much from accepted socialist dogma. I live in Hong Kong, so I know how hard the balance is to strike. But socialism worked so little here that most people are 3rd generation immigrants who fled collectivisation, loss of property right and only desire to be left alone by the evangelists of a better world. It's hard to hear people who leave in free capitalist sandboxes lecture us about how socialism could maybe work. Try and weep, as we did. reply kurthr 2 hours agorootparentWait, Hong Kong was socialist before the National Security Law was passed? I've spent some months in HK-Kowloon (2002-2016) and it was one of the most capitalist places I've ever visited from the entrepreneurs running food stalls and working night markets, to the media (granted my Cantonese is minimal, but there were english language newspapers), to the massive banking business. There was a desperation, hustle, and exploitation along with the positives I expect from capitalism. There seemed to be basic social support, housing, and medical care... but that's true in the US, which I think is not socialist. It seems to me that most of Europe is more socialist, but I'm not here to judge what people want or what's best for them. Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and even Germany, France or England are more socialist than I've experienced in HK, TW, or Singapore. They have pretty well established democracies and rule of law, but basic needs like food/health/housing/child care are pretty well comfortably provided by their governments. More so than past the New Territories. I really wish you the best in HK now. It's a beautiful place full of great people who've worked really hard. Financial leverage provided a lot of jobs and made the rich wealthy, but if that investment fails to turn a profit, everyone will have to pay for it. reply prmoustache 34 minutes agorootparentprevSocialism / communism is nice in theory but not applicable country wide. I would argue that it could be applicable in a voluntary mode in more smaller states (city sized) where people not agreeing would have the freedom to leave. reply chaostheory 4 hours agorootparentprevThe main problem with socialism is the centralization of power which means dictatorships aren’t mutually exclusive from communist systems. moreover unlike most of the world, North Korea still does not have a market economy. It is still a socialist system. It’s similar to the former nation of Yugoslavia when it was ruled by Tito. reply jojobas 9 hours agoparentprev>all that's broken at the moment in our end-stage capitalist societies That's a weird way to spell \"the most prosperous time/space ever, where borderline poor people live like kings 200 years ago, and there are fewer and fewer poor people as time goes on and poverty threshold goes up\". reply dcan 7 hours agorootparentWe're regressing back to fiefdom in Canada thanks to the unaffordability of housing and people in the United States have a similar situation with employer provided medical coverage combined with at-will employment. True, many more people are out of poverty, but few are truly prosperous anymore compared to the \"American Dream\" in the latter half of the 20th century. reply gsk22 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, poor people are better off in absolute terms than 200 years ago. No one is denying this. The question is more that, given how prosperous we are, and how much capital we have at our disposal, why do we still have so many poor people? Why is income inequality so bad? reply api 8 hours agorootparentMultiply 30000 a year (a lower end US wage) by the number of people living in what the UN defines as poverty. That’s about two billion. You get 60 trillion dollars a year. That’s close to world GDP. If you gave that out and those two billion people tried to spend it, you’d just get hyperinflation because there isn’t enough supply to match that demand. We have a lot of abundance but not that much. Still fewer people as a percentage live in poverty by far than at any time in human history. It’s mostly going in the right direction. We’ve lifted a billion out of poverty in the last 20 years. reply hx8 8 hours agorootparentLiving on 30kUSD/yr is a lot different in London than it is in Buenos Aires. To set a universal safety net ensuring everyone had adequate food, shelter, education, medical care, transportation etc would be a lot cheaper than 60tUSD/yr. reply jojobas 6 hours agorootparentFirst, this means, as compared to today, that the results of some people's labor, and a lot of that, are sent to these undeveloped countries, rather than letting them sell it at a price of their choice. Why would they agree to that? Or buying that with tax money, which nobody would agree to either. Second, as the last few decades have shown, just sending food, medicine and other supplies to these regions just makes more miserable people. reply huytersd 7 hours agorootparentprevAt India’s PPP of 3.5 vs the dollar, that would be equivalent to 100k a year for all 1.4 billion people. reply jojobas 9 hours agorootparentprev>Yes, poor people are better off in absolute terms than 200 years ago Not than poor people 200 years ago, than kings 200 years ago.

Does a burger taste any worse if you know someone's having caviar? Also, how would you compare today's wealth inequality with that of 200 years ago, when peasants, being some 90% of the population, didn't own nearly anything at all? reply woodruffw 8 hours agorootparent> Does a burger taste any worse if you know someone's having caviar? Human beings have a fine-tuned sense of inequality and injustice; it's one of the things that makes us self-legislating agents, rather than beasts scrabbling for the top. The burger absolutely does taste worse if you know that it isn't a fair representation of the value of your labor. To make this more salient: your argument would apply to people living under repressive regimes as much as it does to content Westerners sitting at home. Or do you think that North Koreans in China have no right to object, given that their equivalent domestic forced labor would be even worse? reply fervor 8 hours agorootparentIndeed, what is the value of your labor? reply jojobas 6 hours agorootparentprevWell we (and they) know a society can do better than North Korea and it's reasonable to strive for that, but it's not obvious you can do better than the West.

Saying today's poor are better off than before is a distraction from the questions we should be asking: 1) Why are there so many poor? 2) Why are their ranks increasing? To say something is better than before is not the same as saying it is as good as it could be. And yet no one is trumpeting the latter. reply mrkstu 3 hours agorootparentThe main issue is the ones having a problem with the improved state of affairs reliably call on the use of other systems that have always worsened the affairs of countries that adopt them. reply jojobas 6 hours agorootparentprev> Why are their ranks increasing?

Both absolute number and percentage in both \"extreme poverty\" and just \"poverty\" have been steadily decreasing since the 70s. reply nemo44x 7 hours agorootparentprevPoverty is the default state. We shouldn’t ask why we have poor people but rather how can more wealth be generated to have fewer poor people. Our system has redefined what it means to be poor. So much that we’ve forgotten that abject poverty is the default state. We dont need less capitalism but rather more and faster. reply gsk22 6 hours agorootparentThere's plenty of wealth. The issue is the concentration of wealth at the top. Since the current system is deeply unfair, I'm not sure why adding additional wealth to the system would make it any more fair.

There is no clean spectrum. We need more good capitalism (free trade, free movement of labor, entrepreneurship) and less bad capitalism (negative externalities, money in politics). Just like we need more good regulations and less bad regulations. We shouldn't force heterogeneous things into a single conceptual basket (called \"capitalism\") and then conclude more is better, or less is better.

I wish I could report you and downvote you. Most of the people in Gaza are under 18, meaning even if they wanted to they could not vote Hamas out: also a lot of them weren't even born when Hamas took power; Hamas has also never held elections, so unless you're advocating for them to violently overthrow Hamas, something even the IDF cannot accomplish with the backing of the \"strongest\" country on Earth, you're talking nonsense. The IDF indiscriminately kills and targets people in the West Bank where Hamas has no power. Additionally they are threatening to invade Rafah, the place they told Palestinians civilians to flee to and are currently bombing/attacking. And even if that were not the case, occupying forces DO NOT HAVE the right of self defense, which therefore means that the armored struggle against Zionism and settler colonialism is not only JUST, but NECESSARY.

To qualify, a person must generally have a job at a North Korean company and a positive evaluation from a local Party official. “These checks start at the neighborhood,” Breuker said. Candidates who have family in China, or a relative who has already defected, can be disqualified. For some positions, applicants under twenty-seven years of age who are unmarried must have living parents, who can be punished if they try to defect, according to a report from the South Korean government; applicants over twenty-seven must be married. North Korean authorities even select for height: the country’s population is chronically malnourished, and the state prefers candidates who are taller than five feet one, to avoid the official embarrassment of being represented abroad by short people. Once selected, applicants go through pre-departure training, which can last a year and often includes government-run classes covering everything from Chinese customs and etiquette to “enemy operations” and the activities of other countries’ intelligence agencies. (The North Korean government did not respond to requests for comment.) I don't think I\"m ever gonna complain about my job in America again. reply xanthor 8 hours agoparentThat would generally be the goal of pieces like this. reply zaptrem 7 hours agorootparentI think the goal of this piece is closer to reducing the importation of seafood that is the result of forced labor. reply xanthor 7 hours agorootparentThat doesn’t surprise me, but the purpose of New Yorker articles like this is primarily geopolitical in nature, not humanitarian. You can reference what they published in the lead up to the Iraq War as proof. reply vlovich123 7 hours agorootparentprevGiven what’s outlined in the description above, forced labor doesn’t sound like it would meet the criteria as the chance for defection would be higher (+ glowing reviews from your boss). It sounds more like a description for a highly competitive jobs program. reply doctorpangloss 7 hours agorootparentprevI’m not sure why you are being downvoted. I mean in an intellectually honest way, we are fairly powerless, like deglobalization will not solve this and violence by Americans cannot solve this. There’s a whole country of people who are literal close relatives of the victims of this atrocity, and they and their government have determined violence cannot solve this. You don’t need a degree in hottakeology to know this. It brings to mind Last Train Home, maybe the best piece of Chinese propaganda I’ve ever seen. Of course there’s no chance that the New Yorker writers are “allied” with some kind of repressive interest, but if the down voters think the authors are aligned with the US commoner, they’re nuts. reply syndicatedjelly 7 hours agorootparentprevCould your comment be any more indicative of how self-centered American tech workers are? Bad things happen in other parts of world, regardless of what anyone in America thinks about \"RTO\". reply xanthor 7 hours agorootparentI don’t really care about the conditions of tech workers since the lion’s share of the industry is just a speculative outlet for finance which produces no ‘technology’ whatsoever.

HN and Nekoweb are both proprietary services, that's fine, but they run on HTTP and the only thing you need to interact with it is a web browser of some sort, whereas nekoweb's discord “server” relies on a third party (Discord) and uses a nonstandard closed protocol. reply busk07 1 hour agorootparentBy your reasoning, any backend that’s not accessible directly by the user is proprietary. HN would then also be proprietary, because it relies on a third party (HN) and uses a nonstandard closed protocol (this comment section). Any website that stores data and exposes it via their own UI is proprietary (I leave this vague on purpose, as it is up to interpretation). Discord can be run in the browser and is accessible via APIs. I think it’s as open as any other web app by a company that has a commercial interest. Services like Discord have lowered the entry barrier for non-technical conversation and community-building online. It certainly seems to be polarizing. I’ve noticed a lot of my friends and colleagues either embrace it or despise it. I wouldn’t mind an open-source alternative to it, but with the extensive features that it offers that’s hard to achieve. reply littlestymaar 49 minutes agorootparent> By your reasoning, any backend that’s not accessible directly by the user is proprietary I've never said such thing.

I think it’s as open as any other web app by a company that has a commercial interest You need an account to browse Discord, which they can take away from you anytime. If you lose your account you lose your membership to any invite-only communities you belong to, which can be a big deal if you don't have other means to communicate with them to get invited back. Also, Discord isn't indexable by search engines. So, no there's a big difference between Discord and most web forums. Also, I don't have anything in particular against Discord (it's miles ahead of Slack in UX for instance, which I hate with a passion), but when people advertise themselves as fans of the old web, and link to their Discord, one can only smirk from the irony. reply jerbear4328 1 hour agorootparentprevDiscord runs in the browser, same as HN. And the HTTP APIs they use aren't officially documented (except HN's read-only ones via Firebase and Algolia) (though both are easily reverse engineered and OSS frontends exist). There's not much difference. reply anthk 35 minutes agorootparentDiscord it's a cage. HN can be accesed by JS-less browsers and the content will be indexable by any web search engine. There's a huge difference. reply littlestymaar 54 minutes agorootparentprevThe big difference is that Discord is a third party here. Nekoweb, like HN, could implement their own first party forum, but instead rely on a centralized third party from which they cannot migrate. It's very far from the “passionate for the old web and personal websites” stance they are marketing in their pitch. Also AFAIK you cannot be banned from HN for using the API, whereas Discord will ban you for any “misuse”. You also don't need to be logged-in to access HN, which is also indexable by search engines, whereas Discord isn't. reply fantasyui-com 8 hours agoprevHas anybody made a retro page yet?

It has a great deal of technical debt, including performance and security debts that don't receive adequate attention. It also has a huge user community around it, but only a handful of active recurring contributors and companies actually funding development on it (and, even then, the bulk of the development is feature work rather than debt burndown).

In my head I feel like I say \"ess-cue-lite\" pretty much every time. reply chrisweekly 17 hours agorootparenthuh, I get the \"ess-cue-lite\" but not (at all) the \"see-cue-lite\" -- for me, the \"see\" sound only makes sense in the context of \"sequel\" (see-kwell-ite), which is how I instinctively tend to pronounce it. reply smaudet 13 hours agorootparentI think the former pronunciation is more correct, but... I see the point of the later if you are prone to verbalize acronyms: SQL => Verbalized Acronym: \"See-Quell\" vs Structured Query Language: \"Ess-Queue-Ell\" So then See-Cue-lite is a concatenation of the verbalization with the \"lite\". Whereas Ess-Cue-Lite is a concatenation of the acronym pronunciation with the \"lite\". This probably solve the former question of why some people say both and don't understand why. If the conversation/person is saying \"SeeQuel\" and \"Sass\" or \"less\" etc. then \"See-Cue-Lite\" fits that dialect. In a dialog with a lot of acronyms e.g. SQS, VPN, AWS, etc. you are probably more likely to go the acronym route i.e. \"Ess-Cue-Lite\". The term itself is a bastardization of an acronym and the \"lite\" term, I'd argue there's no correct pronunciation. reply samatman 15 hours agorootparentprev\"like a mineral\" reply euroderf 12 hours agoparentprevCan't it just be pronounced \"sclite\", rhyming with (e.g.) \"sprite\" ?

For them, it's not entirely wrong. reply usrusr 9 hours agorootparentprevWouldn't that make SQL a sequel to Sequel? Sorry, I feel like I'm annoying on purpose, I shouldn't do this. Reading up on the history parts in the Wikipedia article, the German language version presents it as if SQL was the Oracle (Relational Software Inc) implementation of IBM's Sequel, the English page says the name was shortened due to trademark issues, before mentioning any implementation outside IBM. That would make Sequel and SQL the same thing, just rebranded early on. It also lists a clever (b)acronym and two other reasons for why they called it sequel before shortening, so it seems like there's a decent amount of mystery around the name. Almost as if it happened before the invention of writing. reply dotancohen 23 minutes agorootparentInteresting that is the case with an Oracle product. Even the name of the company is shrouded in myth. Apparently Larry worked on some government project called Oracle before founding the company, and liked the personalised acronym he could make of the word.

Case in point, a simple \"select * from processes\" takes a solid 3 seconds of kernel time on my laptop. Now you might say, \"well that's clearly a dumb idea because osquery certainly relies on vtab's colUsed field to avoid querying all sorts of expensive stuff when it doesn't have to so you really should only query what you need\" and that's of course 100% true. But it's also a senior developer thought. Easy to see how an inexperienced person might make mistakes like this with any one of the dozens or hundreds of tables offered by osquery and cause performance issues. In terms of security, well it is clearly a kitchen sink project (there's a prometheus client in there, for example: https://osquery.io/schema/5.11.0/#prometheus_metrics), so there's a huge breadth of interfaces it talks to and files controlled by all sorts of people it parses, and the default does seem to be privileged usage, which is the general ballpark where AV engines and their highly dubious track record live. reply mikermcneil 10 hours agorootparentSome example queries: https://fleetdm.com/queries The formula osquery uses to report performance: https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/16123 reply iJohnDoe 17 hours agorootparentprevOr they are a righteous developer who likes to trash people outside of development.

Airwatch the Endpoint management system was working to incorporate this. It was pretty good. Unfortunately they were acquired by VMware which tried to maneuver the product into pretty unrelated VDI tech (Horizon). And of course VMware is completely in the shitcan now with everything being discontinued. We moved to Intune in the end. Which was not better by the way (nobody buys Microsoft because they're great, just because of the network effect). But it does have better long term outlook (no pun intended). But it was a good product while it lasted. The osquery integration was really useful for custom scripts. AirWatch had linux support 4 years ago even though Intune is only starting with that (and it hardly works). reply w0de0 17 hours agoparentDeploy your own, stand-alone osquery instance - it’s open source.

It had its issues but every product does. The problem was that when we had to move to Intune some features we used in airwatch weren't even supported yet! It really made me laugh when Gartner put Intune in their magical Quadrant but not airwatch as Intune wasn't even feature complete at that point for basic mobile uses. I'm sure those Gartner guys just talk to the sales suits but don't actually try the products.

Is there even an established, reliable alternative to intune for Windows? I don’t know. reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentYeah the Mac side was the worst. Many features didn't work reliably or were not updated quickly enough to keep up with OS updates. It was all very beta unfortunately. For Mac JAMF is pretty much the gold standard and I tried to get it but the leadership preferred a \"single pane of glass\" sadly.

    "originBody": "Coroutines in C by Simon Tatham [Coroutines trilogy: C preprocessorC++20 nativegeneral philosophy ] Introduction Structuring a large program is always a difficult job. One of the particular problems that often comes up is this: if you have a piece of code producing data, and another piece of code consuming it, which should be the caller and which should be the callee? Here is a very simple piece of run-length decompression code, and an equally simple piece of parser code: /* Decompression code */ while (1) { c = getchar(); if (c == EOF) break; if (c == 0xFF) { len = getchar(); c = getchar(); while (len--) emit(c); } else emit(c); } emit(EOF); /* Parser code */ while (1) { c = getchar(); if (c == EOF) break; if (isalpha(c)) { do { add_to_token(c); c = getchar(); } while (isalpha(c)); got_token(WORD); } add_to_token(c); got_token(PUNCT); } Each of these code fragments is very simple, and easy to read and understand. One produces a character at a time by calling emit(); the other consumes a character at a time by calling getchar(). If only the calls to emit() and the calls to getchar() could be made to feed data to each other, it would be simple to connect the two fragments together so that the output from the decompressor went straight to the parser. In many modern operating systems, you could do this using pipes between two processes or two threads. emit() in the decompressor writes to a pipe, and getchar() in the parser reads from the other end of the same pipe. Simple and robust, but also heavyweight and not portable. Typically you don't want to have to divide your program into threads for a task this simple. In this article I offer a creative solution to this sort of structure problem. Rewriting The conventional answer is to rewrite one of the ends of the communication channel so that it's a function that can be called. Here's an example of what that might mean for each of the example fragments. int decompressor(void) { static int repchar; static int replen; if (replen > 0) { replen--; return repchar; } c = getchar(); if (c == EOF) return EOF; if (c == 0xFF) { replen = getchar(); repchar = getchar(); replen--; return repchar; } else return c; } void parser(int c) { static enum { START, IN_WORD } state; switch (state) { case IN_WORD: if (isalpha(c)) { add_to_token(c); return; } got_token(WORD); state = START; /* fall through */ case START: add_to_token(c); if (isalpha(c)) state = IN_WORD; else got_token(PUNCT); break; } } Of course you don't have to rewrite both of them; just one will do. If you rewrite the decompressor in the form shown, so that it returns one character every time it's called, then the original parser code can replace calls to getchar() with calls to decompressor(), and the program will be happy. Conversely, if you rewrite the parser in the form shown, so that it is called once for every input character, then the original decompression code can call parser() instead of emit() with no problems. You would only want to rewrite both functions as callees if you were a glutton for punishment. And that's the point, really. Both these rewritten functions are thoroughly ugly compared to their originals. Both of the processes taking place here are easier to read when written as a caller, not as a callee. Try to deduce the grammar recognised by the parser, or the compressed data format understood by the decompressor, just by reading the code, and you will find that both the originals are clear and both the rewritten forms are less clear. It would be much nicer if we didn't have to turn either piece of code inside out. Knuth's coroutines In The Art of Computer Programming, Donald Knuth presents a solution to this sort of problem. His answer is to throw away the stack concept completely. Stop thinking of one process as the caller and the other as the callee, and start thinking of them as cooperating equals. In practical terms: replace the traditional \"call\" primitive with a slightly different one. The new \"call\" will save the return value somewhere other than on the stack, and will then jump to a location specified in another saved return value. So each time the decompressor emits another character, it saves its program counter and jumps to the last known location within the parser - and each time the parser needs another character, it saves its own program counter and jumps to the location saved by the decompressor. Control shuttles back and forth between the two routines exactly as often as necessary. This is very nice in theory, but in practice you can only do it in assembly language, because no commonly used high level language supports the coroutine call primitive. Languages like C depend utterly on their stack-based structure, so whenever control passes from any function to any other, one must be the caller and the other must be the callee. So if you want to write portable code, this technique is at least as impractical as the Unix pipe solution. Stack-based coroutines So what we would really like is the ability to mimic Knuth's coroutine call primitive in C. We must accept that in reality, at the C level, one function will be caller and the other will be callee. In the caller, we have no problem; we code the original algorithm, pretty much exactly as written, and whenever it has (or needs) a character it calls the other function. The callee has all the problems. For our callee, we want a function which has a \"return and continue\" operation: return from the function, and next time it is called, resume control from just after the return statement. For example, we would like to be able to write a function that says int function(void) { int i; for (i = 0; i0); } We can put it to a slightly different use in the coroutine trick. Instead of using a switch statement to decide which goto statement to execute, we can use the switch statement to perform the jump itself: int function(void) { static int i, state = 0; switch (state) { case 0: /* start of function */ for (i = 0; i i as a loop counter where you would previously just have used i; virtually all your serious variables become elements of the coroutine context structure. But it removes the problems with re-entrancy, and still hasn't impacted the structure of the routine. (Of course, if C only had Pascal's with statement, we could arrange for the macros to make this layer of indirection truly transparent as well. A pity. Still, at least C++ users can manage this by having their coroutine be a class member, and keeping all its local variables in the class so that the scoping is implicit.) Included here is a C header file that implements this coroutine trick as a set of pre-defined macros. There are two sets of macros defined in the file, prefixed scr and ccr. The scr macros are the simple form of the technique, for when you can get away with using static variables; the ccr macros provide the advanced re-entrant form. Full documentation is given in a comment in the header file itself. Note that Visual C++ version 6 doesn't like this coroutine trick, because its default debug state (Program Database for Edit and Continue) does something strange to the __LINE__ macro. To compile a coroutine-using program with VC++ 6, you must turn off Edit and Continue. (In the project settings, go to the \"C/C++\" tab, category \"General\", setting \"Debug info\". Select any option other than \"Program Database for Edit and Continue\".) (The header file is MIT-licensed, so you can use it in anything you like without restriction. If you do find something the MIT licence doesn't permit you to do, mail me, and I'll probably give you explicit permission to do it anyway.) Follow this link for coroutine.h. Thanks for reading.

I think it does a lovely job explaining control flow and it has helped me to think more explicitly about storage of state on and off the stack as well as the readability consequences of different approaches. My conclusion for now is that the choice to use C coroutines is best left to the library user. For example: Mongoose (https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose) uses event callbacks to deal with asynchronousness. It is much more pleasant to wrap a library like this in whatever thread/task primitives your system has rather than try to port the mythical cross-platform C couroutine or worse, std::thread. reply chongli 15 hours agoparentIt’s Simon Tatham’s website.

It's a joy to watch all the CppCon videos about C++ coroutines, primarily by Microsoft folks. \"Negative-cost abstraction\" is such a nice hook phrase. Friends at Meta mentioned to me a couple years ago that they started using c++ coroutines, which ended up being a big mistake because they had to face compiler implementation bugs, which must have been nasty to track down. At Google, we are eagerly waiting for the brilliant folks that are working on properly integrating them in google3/ to tell us when the time has come to use them. This article uses Duff's device [1] to motivate structured gotos via macros as an implementation strategy for C coroutines. Duff wanted to loop-unroll this: do { *to = *from++; } while (--count > 0); which he did in this way (shortened for brevity) : int n = (count + 3) / 4; switch (count % 4) { case 0: do { *to = *from++; case 3: *to = *from++; case 2: *to = *from++; case 1: *to = *from++; } while (--n > 0); } That is to say, he realized that he could use `case` statements (almost) anywhere in a `switch` block. The connection with coroutines is simple: One can wrap the whole function body with a switch statement, use a static variable for holding the location of the latest coroutine return, and label all co-returns with a `case` statement: #define coBegin static int state = 0; switch (state) { case 0: #define coReturn(x) do { state = __LINE_; return x; case __LINE:; } while (0) #define coFinish } int function(void) { static int i; // function state can't be local anymore. coBegin; for (i = 0; ifbcode in the last few years, I think there are weird upsides AND downsides to having async code littered through your C++ (aka co_yield, co_return, co_await, etc). The advantage, compared to the internal stuff google3 was using, was that as you read code, the async nature of various parts was obvious. Some programmers at G would spend entire quarters+ not knowing what the threading model was, and cause serious bugs in retrospect. The disadvantage is actually much dumber - a lot of code \"could\" be async, and over time becomes entirely async because that's the mode the programmer is in when writing the program. The choice to use a spinlock vs. a mutex w/yields should be one based on the size of the critical section and the threading going on at the time. Unfortunately to make code more readable/uniform/etc you end up with entire projects doing one or the other. I'd love to learn more about language implementations of threading that do not default either way, but instead could take a profile of the previous run, and make the next run more optimal, without having to change the code or causing bugs. reply dividuum 15 hours agoparentprevThe alternative is to use the „labels as values“ feature of GCC. You can take the address of a label and later jump to it. I contributed the code that’s now in lc-addrlabels.h back in 2005 :-) I also used the GCC local labels feature to completely avoid using __LINE__ anywhere, so you could have multiple coReturns in a single code line: #define LC_SET(s) do { ({ __label__ resume; resume: (s) = &&resume; }); }while(0) reply bxparks 13 hours agorootparentDefinitely, \"labels as values\" (aka \"computed gotos\", https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html) is so much better than Duff's device. Unfortunately, computed-gotos is not a C language standard. I don't understand why. I think FORTRAN had it in the 60s. It is so useful in some situations, like a coroutine, or a byte-code interpreter. Is it because some obscure DSP chip with a sizeof(char)==32 using 1's complement arithmetic can't support it? Then maybe make it implementation-defined and allow the rest of the world get nice things. reply weinzierl 54 minutes agorootparentSteve Wozniak's Integer BASIC (aka Apple BASIC) had computed-gotos too. Not sure about Microsoft BASIC, but Commodore BASIC had definitely lost this feature. reply mananaysiempre 7 hours agorootparentprev(For ease of reference—Fortran calls this an assigned GOTO: jump to label stored in a variable—as an integer number, as is Fortran’s way, not an address. A computed GOTO in Fortran is more like a switch statement in C: jump to the first label listed in the statement if the specified variable is one, to the second if it is two, ..., fall through to the next statement otherwise.) reply mananaysiempre 8 hours agoparentprev> [Duff] realized that he could use `case` statements (almost) anywhere in a `switch` block. That’s likely true, in that it probably was a moment for realization for Duff (and many others reading him, including me); yet it’s almost certainly a completely intentional feature. (As mentioned at the bottom of TFA, Duff also realized you could build coroutines on top of it but thought the idea “revolting”.) There’s a temptation to think of C’s `switch` as a very inexpressive pattern match, and then the “fallthrough” seems like a bug and so on. It’s not. It’s a computed GOTO, in the vein of the one in Fortran but more convenient in that the values don’t have to be sequential, and also in that you don’t have to list all the labels at the top. (In fact, now that I’m writing this out, it’s more of a computed COMEFROM, then, isn’t it? However insane that sounds.) reply Scubabear68 13 hours agoparentprevAh the C pre-processor, the gift that keeps on giving after all these years :-( reply agumonkey 8 hours agorootparentI don't mind macro heavy C code, but this one made me freeze reply benlivengood 13 hours agoparentprevOh come on, just rewrite it all in Go!

Also, the refinement at the end of the article: \"We arrange an extra function parameter, which is a pointer to a context structure; we declare all our local state, and our coroutine state variable, as elements of that structure.\" sounds like implementing a closure to me.

Modern processors have many cores, but coroutines will (often) only use a single core. Edit to add: This is a real world problem too. Until recently qemu, which extensively uses coroutines, would put a lot of its block device I/O through a single thread. This caused some performance issues. Kevin Wolf and others have spent years of effort fixing this so modern qemu will use many threads for I/O (this work will appear in RHEL 9.4). reply samatman 12 hours agoparentThe only connection between threads and coroutines is that some single-threaded language runtimes only have coroutines, so you might occasionally use them where threads would be a better choice. Coroutines are a way of structuring single-threaded execution, and a useful one. The example in the Fine Article of a producer-consumer pattern is a good one, attaching a stream to a parser isn't a parallel algorithm so threads are useless for writing it. Naturally, using a single-threaded paradigm for work which could be performed in parallel is inefficient, but coroutines aren't a poor man's parallelism, they're a control structure which functions on its own terms. They can be combined productively with threads, such as using an event loop in a web server to thread (as in needle) coroutines through various blocking events with a dispatcher, and the runtime can spin up a thread per core to parallelize this, which reduces per-thread coordination to checking the depth of each thread's work queue and farming the request to the least congested one. reply mananaysiempre 8 hours agorootparentBob Nystrom makes this argument best, I think, in his two-parter on loops and iteration[1,2]. Looping over data structures is of course only one example of how one can apply coroutines, but a very established one. The canonical problem requiring coroutines[3] is also essentially about doing that. Or for those who want something different there’s the elevator (and elevator-userbase) simulation from TAoCP volume 1, also an essentially concurrent problem with little to no parallelism or I/O to it.

Concurrency is useful for abstraction and expressiveness. Parallelism is useful for making your code run faster by running parts of it in parallel on multiple cores.

If you have decoupled, parallel workloads they're going to naturally be working on disjoint data. The idea behind coroutines is that you have some kind of local workload with synchronous data that, for whatever reason, is easiest to express \"inside out\" with a function that gets to loop over something and \"push\" the results to its abstracted consumer whose code lives somewhere else, vs. the natural functional paradigm where the inner loop is a conceptual \"pull\" controlled by the caller. reply repelsteeltje 15 hours agorootparentThank you for eloquently expressing an observation I probably should have learned years ago. reply pengaru 15 hours agoparentprevThere's often a sweet spot to be had in mixing threads and coroutines, where you have a coroutine scheduler instance per thread, and a thread created per core. Then rarely, if ever, migrate coroutines across schedulers, and rarely, if ever, share data between coroutines on different schedulers. Coroutines can enable an ergonomic concurrent programming style while avoiding the need for any locking at all via cooperative scheduling. You generally end up with higher scheduling latencies, but potentially quite high throughput by removing any need for atomics/locking overheads, and no timer constantly interrupting execution for preemptive scheduling. reply rwmj 13 hours agorootparentRight, that's what qemu has ended up with. reply Quekid5 16 hours agoparentprevNot just that, but the scaling problems with threads are usually massively overstated.

Also the incredible quantity software today, and how dang cheap it is. reply jonhohle 8 hours agoprevI’ve used libaco in the past for coroutines in C. I found zlib a pain to use when using curl scheduled with libuv to fetch data. zlib expects a read loop to extract data, but libuv provides an evented push model. Saving all of the zlib state and building a state machine seemed tedious, but a coroutine made the zlib code look like the standard, blocking loop. This was just code for my own amusement, and maybe used by a few people, for non-production work. I’d do it again, however, if I needed to. reply DenisM 16 hours agoprevSetjmp/longjump are the built-in coroutines in C, no? reply fweimer 16 hours agoparentSome longjmp implementations unwind the stack, so they can't be used for coroutine switching. Even if it works (it's technically undefined), you need to get a suitable stack from somewhere. The next issue is that usually, applications want to resume coroutines on a thread different from the one it on which it was suspended. That runs into trouble because on some systems, compilers cache the address of thread-local variables in the local stack frame, assuming that the thread does not switch in a function mid-execution. reply DenisM 15 hours agorootparentThe only platform I’ve seen stack unwind was VAX/VMS :) But yes, you do need to allocate the stack which could take up a lot of ram. It’s odd not to mention it in the article though. reply fweimer 14 hours agorootparentCurrent glibc unwinds the shadow stack if it is active: https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86... It makes longjmp useless for coroutine switching, although it does not result in other effects of stack unwinding (such as invoking C++ destructors). On Windows, longjmp really unwinds the stack (and maybe this is something influenced by VMS): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/refe... “In Microsoft C++ code on Windows, longjmp uses the same stack-unwinding semantics as exception-handling code. It's safe to use in the same places that C++ exceptions can be raised.” reply DenisM 14 hours agorootparentWell, things have changed since I looked last. Thanks for explaining. FWIW, back in the nineties we just wrote our own setjmp/longjmp for VMS to avoid stack unwind - save registers / restore registers. We used it to implement coroutines in Modula 2, iirc. reply josephcsible 13 hours agoparentprevNo. The C standard says this about longjmp: \"if the function containing the invocation of the setjmp macro has terminated execution in the interim [...] the behavior is undefined\". So while you can longjmp out of functions, you can't longjmp back into them. reply dkjaudyeqooe 16 hours agoparentprevThese are stackless coroutines, if you use longjump you have to create a stack for the coroutine. There are pros and cons for each style. reply trealira 7 hours agorootparentIn theory (but only possible in assembly right now), there could be coroutines that shared the stack of their caller. As long as the caller (who's calling from a normal function) finishes calling the coroutine and doesn't expect to be able to call it after they return, then you could use it to implement iterators, e.g. over a binary tree or a hash table, like generators in Python. It could work as long as the caller used the stack frame base pointer to refer to their saved local variables, since the stack pointer could be changed between yields to the coroutine. I'm genuinely surprised there hasn't been a compiled programming language to do that other than Sather and CLU[0] (both of which are long dead by now). Graydon Hoare originally wanted them in Rust [1], but LLVM didn't support it, so it was scrapped. [0]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800127.804079 (the third PDF page, page 125) [1]: https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html (search \"non-escaping coroutine\") reply ajross 16 hours agoparentprevYou can absolutely build coroutines out of a generalized context switch. So yes, in some sense. But note that the linked article doesn't use setjmp/longjmp, which is what makes it so clever. FWIW: would I personally actually use this trick? Almost certainly not. C APIs aren't well suited to that level of abstraction IMHO, if you have an app that needs it leave the C stuff to the stuff C is good at and wrap a C++ or Rust or whatever layer on top for the subtleties. reply crabmusket 7 hours agoprevI was so sure this was about protothreads til I remembered its name. https://dunkels.com/adam/pt/ reply rurban 13 hours agoprevAlso related, the C++ lambda fuckup: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33084431 reply vinay_ys 15 hours agoprevAh, this page again! it's been more than two decades? since I saw this page last?

But in the conclusion, the author talks about actually making this work by providing a context object to hold all of the intermediate state and providing this context object to the callee. Once this is required, how does this approach compare to simply using an external iterator? Seems to me like an iterator solves the lion's share of the problem here. It moves the state into the caller's stack (or above them), it's easy to understand, simple to implement and doesn't involve unenclosed and context-dependent macros. reply btilly 15 hours agoparentWhy would you assume that this is a joke? C (particularly back when this was written) was a low level language. You could not simply use an external iterator - they didn't exist. And if you try to roll your own, you'll wind up dealing with a lot of complications around resource management in a language which lacks basic memory management. But the proof is in the pudding. Back then it was common to want to telnet into a Unix machine from Windows. And the only two solutions that worked well enough to consider were installing Cygwin, or installing PuTTY. Cygwin was better if you needed a Unix environment on your Windows machine. Otherwise PuTTY was your answer. As the article comments, PuTTY was written with this technique. When you've solved a problem that a lot of people had, and your solution is widely acknowledged as the best one out there, people get interested in how you think it should be solved. Which is why this article interested me when I first saw in many years ago on Slashdot. So absolutely not a joke. reply syncurrent 16 hours agoparentprevProto-Activities have this context to store the state in the caller. https://github.com/frameworklabs/proto_activities reply ajross 16 hours agoparentprev [–] > Seems to me like an iterator solves the lion's share of the problem here. Iterator APIs are indeed aimed at the same kind of problem, but they're not the same solution. And often they're harder to write. If you have a component with a big list of stuff, it's generally easier to write and understand the idea of \"iterate over my big list of stuff and emit one item at a time to my consumer\" than it is \"what state do I need to remember such that when I get called again I can emit the correct next item given the one I just emitted?\". Coroutines are a way of expressing the former. Iterators are the latter. If all you do is write the outer loop, iterators are absolutely just as good. If you need to write the iterator itself, it's more of a discussion. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_101_marginalia-3-years/",
    "originBody": "Posted: 2024-02-25 Tags: search-engine nlnet It’s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone, now my full time job. While there’s always things that can be improved, it’s fair to say the search engine has never worked as well as it does right now. A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps biggest of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and into a proper enterprise server. An overarching theme for the year has been cleaning up the code base and streamlining the application, not only to keep the operational workload manageable, but to make the application and codebase more accessible to other people, both operators and developers. It’s been a lot of work, but it’s beginning to pay off. It feels distant, but the search engine used to require days-long outages when switching indexes. This is gone. Since recently, it’s also capable of zero downtime upgrades. So much of the operational side used to be weeks-long manual processes, now you press a button in a GUI instead. Something which had an outsized impact was adding support for anchor text keywords. It’s made an incredible difference in the search engine’s ability to find relevant results. It wasn’t immediately apparant when the change was made, beacuse it initially wasn’t very well integrated, but as this new relevance signal settled in, that was a real wow moment. It’s also been something like eight months since this became my full time occupation, thanks to the generous people at nlnet. This has been a bit of a trip in its own regard. The hardest part about this has probably been not working too much, I’ve been trying to take at least one day off per week, and sometimes succeeding! I know I’m leaps and bounds smarter when I’m well rested, so actually resting sometimes should theoretically be in line with getting stuff done. It’s just so fun though… The quest to reach 1B indexed documents is slowly ongoing. It’s proving a bit harder than anticipated, not because the software can’t handle it, but because the signal to noise ratio of the web isn’t very good; a huge reason why the search engine works relatively well is because of what it doesn’t index. That said, the index has gone from 50-100M a year ago, to 220M last crawl, and likely 290-300M when the next crawl round is finished based on the growth of the two partitions that have already finished. Next on the chopping block is query parsing and execution. There’s a great deal of room for improvement in this area. I’m currently engaged in a bit of mise en place to clean up the affected code before the real work begins. That said, the grand leaps forward in this project has always been experimental, so even though things are planned, I think it’s fairly certain it’s the un-planned things that will be the ones to really make a dent. Like those anchor texts. Finally! Thanks NLnet, thanks FUTO, thanks Patreons, thanks advocates, and users. This wouldn’t be possible without you. Previous: Best SEO spam 2024 reddit 2024-02-07",

But If I compare apples to apples the first ten results are just so much better I'd say 8/10 in Marginalia for this example are great to good, while the first 10 (things I could click on) are by companies that don't teach me anything or have articles full of ads. reply bluish29 13 hours agorootparentkagi will give me scilab as the result #13 and this probably because I raise arxiv and stackoverflow results which will get high. reply dewey 18 hours agorootparentprevI don‘t think your examples are very good, these are very generic search terms and if the results are good or bad very much depends on the person searching and what they are looking for. reply marginalia_nu 18 hours agorootparentUnderspecified queries (\"generic search terms\") is actually one of the tricky problems in search.

The search engine has no ambitions to provide a knowledge graph at this point. It's for finding documents on the internet, rather than answering questions. Answering questions is a definitely something one might want, but it often comes at the expense of finding documents. > raid calculator > The results are OK but you still have random noise like a Pokemon save/cheat editor page? The pokemon result was discussing an application called \"raidcalc\". Seems like a good match, given the search engine does not profile you at all and has no clue about what your interests are. > all quiet on the western front movie book differences Hmm, I think there's an upper bound on the query length you hit. Could probably remove this, it's a pretty old, an artifact from when the query execution didn't deal with long queries well. --edit-- Hmm, I increased the limit but they're still kinda not very good. Although this is definitely squarely within the realm of what I'm working on next, which is query understanding and execution. Right now the search engine doesn't really know how group the terms. Like a human being can see that you'd want |all quiet on the western front| in a sequence, preferrably in the title or appearing a few times, and 'movie', 'book', and 'differences' should be important to the document, but not necessarily appear in that exact order. The search engine currently looks for either documents where they all appear in proximity, or all individual words have high tf-idf relevance markers. Not great for this query. reply mdaniel 15 hours agorootparentI hope this tone comes across correctly as just a suggestion: I get a lot of mileage out of the \"Send Feedback\" option in DDG, which they claim actual humans do read.

    "originBody": "Mamba Explained Feb 11, 2024 The State Space Model taking on Transformers Right now, AI is eating the world. And by AI, I mean Transformers. Practically all the big breakthroughs in AI over the last few years are due to Transformers. Mamba, however, is one of an alternative class of models called State Space Models (SSMs). Importantly, for the first time, Mamba promises similar performance (and crucially similar scaling laws) as the Transformer whilst being feasible at long sequence lengths (say 1 million tokens). We achieve this long context by removing the “quadratic bottleneck” in the Attention Mechanism. Mamba also runs fast - like “up to 5x faster than Transformer fast”1. Mamba performs similarly (or slightly better than) other Language Models on The Pile Gu and Dao, the Mamba authors write: Mamba enjoys fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation. Here we’ll discuss: The advantages (and disadvantages) of Mamba (🐍) vs Transformers (🤖), Analogies and intuitions for thinking about Mamba, and What Mamba means for Interpretability, AI Safety and Applications. Problems with Transformers - Maybe Attention Isn’t All You Need We’re very much in the Transformer-era of history. ML used to be about detecting cats and dogs. Now, with Transformers, we’re generating human-like poetry, coding better than the median competitive programmer, and solving the protein folding problem. But Transformers have one core problem. In a transformer, every token can look back at every previous token when making predictions. For this lookback, we cache detailed information about each token in the so-called KV cache. When using the Attention Mechanism, information from all previous tokens can be passed to the current token This pairwise communication means a forward pass is O(n²) time complexity in training (the dreaded quadratic bottleneck) and each new token generated autoregressively takes O(n) time. That is to say, as the context gets larger, the model gets slower. To add insult to injury, storing this KV cache requires O(n) space. The fateful CUDA OOM error looms large as the memory footprint balloons. If space were the only issue, we might just add more GPUs but with latency growing quadratically… perhaps not. On the margin, we can mitigate the quadratic bottleneck with techniques like Sliding Window Attention or clever CUDA optimisations like FlashAttention. But ultimately, for super long context windows (like a chatbot which remembers every conversation you’ve shared), we need a different approach. Foundation Model Backbones Fundamentally, all good ML architecture backbones have components for two important operations: Communication between tokens Computation within a token The Transformer Block In transformers, this is Attention (communication) and MLPs (computation). We improve transformers by optimising these two operations2. We would like to replace the Attention component 3 with some other method for communicating between tokens. Mamba uses the Control Theory inspired SSM for Communication and keeps MLP-style projections for Computation. The Mamba Block Like a Transformer made up of stacked transformer blocks, Mamba is made up of stacked Mamba blocks as above. We would like to understand and motivate the choice of the SSM for sequence transformations. Motivating Mamba - A Throwback to Temple Run Imagine we’re building a Temple Run agent 4. It chooses if the runner should move left or right at any time. To successfully pick the correct direction, we need information about our surroundings. Let’s call the collection of relevant information the state. Here the state likely includes your current position and velocity, the position of the nearest obstacle, weather conditions, etc. Claim 1: if you know the current state of the world and how the world is evolving, then you can use this to determine the direction to move. Note that you don’t need to look at the whole screen all the time. You can figure out what will happen to most of the screen by noting that as you run, the obstacles move down the screen. You only need to look at the top of the screen to understand the new information and then simulate the rest. This lends itself to a natural formulation. Let h be the hidden state, relevant knowledge about the world. Also let x be the input, the observation that you get each time. h’ then represents the derivative of the hidden state, i.e. how the state is evolving. We’re trying to predict y, the optimal next move (right or left). Now, Claim 1 states that from the hidden state h, h’, and the new observation x, you can figure out y. More concretely, h, the state, can be represented as a differential equation (Eq 1a): \\[h’(t) = \\mathbf{A}h(t) + \\mathbf{B}x(t)\\] Knowing h allows you to determine your next move y (Eq 1b): \\[y(t) = \\mathbf{C}h(t) + \\mathbf{D}x(t)\\] The system evolves as a function of the current state and new observations. A small new observation is enough because we can determine most of the state by applying known state dynamics to the previous state. That is, most of the screen isn’t new, it’s just the natural downward movement of the previous state. Fully knowing the state would allow us to pick the best next move, y. You can learn a lot about the system dynamics by observing the top of the screen - if it’s moving faster, we can infer the whole screen is and the game is speeding up5. In this way, even if we start off knowing nothing about the game except our limited observation, pretty soon we could understand the whole screen. What’s the State? Here, state refers to the variables that, when combined with the input variables, fully determine the future system behaviour. In theory, once we have the state, there’s nothing else we need to know about the past to predict the future. With this choice of state, the system is converted to a Markov Decision Process. Ideally, the state is a fairly small amount of information which captures the essential properties of the system. That is, the state is a compression of the past 6 Discretisation - How To Deal With Living in a Quantised World Okay, great! So, given some state and input observation, we have an autoregressive-style system to determine the next action. Amazing! In practice though, there’s a little snag here. We’re modelling time as continuous. But in real life, we get new inputs and take new actions at discrete time steps 7. We would like to convert this continuous-time differential equation into a discrete-time difference equation. This conversion process is known as discretisation. Discretisation is a well-studied problem in the literature. Mamba uses the Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) discretisation8. To give an idea of what’s happening morally, consider a naive first-order approximation9. From Equation 1a, we have \\[h’(t) = \\mathbf{A}h(t) + \\mathbf{B}x(t)\\] And for small ∆, \\[h’(t) \\approx \\frac{h(t+\\Delta) - h(t)}{\\Delta}\\] by the definition of the derivative. We let: \\[h_t = h(t)\\] and \\[h_{t+1} = h(t + \\Delta)\\] and substitute into Equation 1a giving: \\[h_{t+1} - h_t \\approx \\Delta (\\mathbf{A}h_t + \\mathbf{B}x_t)\\] \\[\\Rightarrow h_{t+1} \\approx (I + \\Delta \\mathbf{A})h_t + (\\Delta \\mathbf{B})x_t\\] Hence, after renaming the coefficients and relabelling indices, we have the discrete representations: The Discretised Version of the SSM Equation If you’ve ever looked at an RNN before 10 and this feels familiar - trust your instincts: We have some input x, which is combined with the previous hidden state by some transform to give the new hidden state. Then we use the hidden state to calculate the output at each time step. Understanding the SSM Matrices Now, we can interpret the A, B, C, D matrices more intuitively: A is the transition state matrix. It shows how you transition the current state into the next state. It asks “How should I forget the less relevant parts of the state over time?” B is mapping the new input into the state, asking “What part of my new input should I remember?”. 11 C is mapping the state to the output of the SSM. It asks, “How can I use the state to make a good next prediction?”. 12 D is how the new input passes through to the output. It’s a kind of modified skip connection that asks “How can I use the new input in my prediction?” Visual Representation of The SSM Equations Additionally, ∆ has a nice interpretation - it’s the step size, or what we might call the linger time or the dwell time. For large ∆, you focus more on that token; for small ∆, you skip past the token immediately and don’t include it much in the next state. And that’s it! That’s the SSM, our ~drop-in replacement for Attention (Communication) in the Mamba block. The Computation in the Mamba architecture comes from regular linear projections, non-linearities, and local convolutions - the regular ML building blocks we know and love! Okay great, that’s the theory - but does this work? Well… Effectiveness vs Efficiency: Attention is Focus, Selectivity is Prioritisation At WWDC ‘97, Steve Jobs famously noted that “focusing is about saying no”. Focus is ruthless prioritisation. It’s common to think about Attention positively as choosing what to notice. In the Steve Jobs sense, we might instead frame Attention negatively as choosing what to discard. There’s a classic intuition pump in Machine Learning known as the Cocktail Party Problem 13. Imagine a party with dozens of simultaneous loud conversations: Question: How do we recognise what one person is saying when others are talking at the same time? 14 Answer: The brain solves this problem by focusing your “attention” on a particular stimulus and hence drowning out all other sounds as much as possible. Transformers use Dot-Product Attention to focus in on the most relevant tokens. A big reason Attention is so great is that you have the potential to look back at everything that ever happened in its context. This is like photographic memory when done right. 15 Transformers (🤖) are extremely effective. But they aren’t very efficient. They store everything from the past so that they can look back at tokens with theoretically perfect recall. Traditional RNNs (🔁) are the opposite - they forget a lot, only recalling a small amount in their hidden state and discarding the rest. They are very efficient - their state is small. Yet they are less effective as discarded information cannot be recovered. We’d like something closer to the Pareto frontier of the effectiveness/efficiency tradeoff. Something that’s more effective than traditional RNNs and more efficient than transformers. The Mamba Architecture seems to offer a solution which pushes out the Pareto frontier of effectiveness/efficiency. SSMs are as efficient as RNNs, but we might wonder how effective they are. After all, it seems like they would have a hard time discarding only unnecessary information and keeping everything relevant. If each token is being processed the same way, applying the same A and B matrices as if in a factory assembly line for tokens, there is no context-dependence. We would like the forgetting and remembering matrices (A and B respectively) to vary and dynamically adapt to inputs. The Selection Mechanism Selectivity allows each token to be transformed into the state in a way that is unique to its own needs. Selectivity is what takes us from vanilla SSM models (applying the same A (forgetting) and B (remembering) matrices to every input) to Mamba, the Selective State Space Model. In regular SSMs, A, B, C and D are learned matrices - that is \\(\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}_{\\theta}\\) etc. (where θ represents the learned parameters) With the Selection Mechanism in Mamba, A, B, C and D are also functions of x. That is \\(\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}_{\\theta(x)}\\) etc; the matrices are context dependent rather than static. Mamba (right) differs from traditional SSMs by allowing A,B,C matrices to be selective i.e. context dependent Making A and B functions of x allows us to get the best of both worlds: We’re selective about what we include in the state, which improves effectiveness vs traditional SSMs. Yet, since the state size is bounded, we improve on efficiency relative to the Transformer. We have O(1), not O(n) space and O(n) not O(n²) time requirements. The Mamba paper authors write: The efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension. Humans (mostly) don’t have photographic memory for everything they experience within a lifetime - or even within a day! There’s just way too much information to retain it all. Subconsciously, we select what to remember by choosing to forget, throwing away most information as we encounter it. Transformers (🤖) decide what to focus on at recall time. Humans (🧑) also decide what to throw away at memory-making time. Humans filter out information early and often. If we had infinite capacity for memorisation, it’s clear the transformer approach is better than the human approach - it truly is more effective. But it’s less efficient - transformers have to store so much information about the past that might not be relevant. Transformers (🤖) only decide what’s relevant at recall time. The innovation of Mamba (🐍) is allowing the model better ways of forgetting earlier - it’s focusing by choosing what to discard using Selectivity, throwing away less relevant information at memory-making time16. The Problems of Selectivity Applying the Selection Mechanism does have its gotchas though. Non-selective SSMs (i.e. A,B not dependent on x) are fast to compute in training. This is because the component of \\(y_t\\) which depends on \\(x_i\\) can be expressed as a linear map, i.e. a single matrix that can be precomputed! For example (ignoring the D component, the skip connection): \\[y_2 = \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}x_2 + \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}x_1 + \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}x_0\\] If we’re paying attention, we might spot something even better here - this expression can be written as a convolution. Hence we can apply the Fast Fourier Transform and the Convolution Theorem to compute this very efficiently on hardware as in Equation 3 below. We can calculate Equation 2, the SSM equations, efficiently in the Convolutional Form, Equation 3. Unfortunately, with the Selection Mechanism, we lose the convolutional form. Much attention is given to making Mamba efficient on modern GPU hardware using similar hardware optimisation tricks to Tri Dao’s Flash Attention 17. With the hardware optimisations, Mamba is able to run faster than comparably sized Transformers. Machine Learning for Political Economists - How Large Should The State Be? The Mamba authors write, “the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterised by how well they compress their state”. In other words, like in political economy18, the fundamental problem is how to manage the state. 🔁 Traditional RNNs are anarchic They have a small, minimal state. The size of the state is bounded. The compression of state is poor. 🤖 Transformers are communist They have a maximally large state. The “state” is just a cache of the entire history with no compression. Every context token is treated equally until recall time. 🐍Mamba has a compressed state …but it’s selective about what goes in. Mamba says we can get away with a small state if the state is well focused and effective 19. Language Models and State Size The upshot is state representation is critical. A smaller state is more efficient; a larger state is more effective. The key is to selectively and dynamically compress data into the state. Mamba’s Selection Mechanism allows for context-dependent reasoning, focusing and ignoring. For both performance and interpretability, understanding the state seems to be very useful. Information Flow in Transformer vs Mamba How do Transformers know anything? At initialisation, a transformer isn’t very smart. It learns in two ways: Training data (Pretraining, SFT, RLHF etc) In context-data Training Data Models learn from their training data. This is a kind of lossy compression of input data into the weights. We can think of the effect of pretraining data on the transformer kinda like the effect of your ancestor’s experiences on your genetics - you can’t recall their experiences, you just have vague instincts about them 20. In Context-Data Transformers use their context as short-term memory, which they can recall with ~perfect fidelity. So we get In-Context Learning, e.g. using induction heads to solve the Indirect Object Identification task, or computing Linear Regression. Retrieval Note that Transformers don’t filter their context at all until recall time. So if we have a bunch of information we think might be useful to the Transformer, we filter it outside the Transformer (using Information Retrieval strategies) and then stuff the results into the prompt. This process is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG determines relevant information for the context window of a transformer. A human with the internet is kinda like a RAG system - you still have to know what to search but whatever you retrieve is as salient as short-term memory to you. Information Flow for Mamba Training Data acts similarly for Mamba. However, the lines are slightly blurred for in-context data and retrieval. In-context data for Mamba is compressed/filtered similar to retrieval data for transformers. This in-context data is also accessible for look-up like for transformers (although with somewhat lower fidelity). Transformer context is to Mamba states what short-term is to long-term memory. Mamba doesn’t just have “RAM”, it has a hard drive21 22. Swapping States as a New Prompting Paradigm Currently, we often use RAG to give a transformer contextual information. With Mamba-like models, you could instead imagine having a library of states created by running the model over specialised data. States could be shared kinda like LoRAs for image models. For example, I could do inference on 20 physics textbooks and, say, 100 physics questions and answers. Then I have a state which I can give to you. Now you don’t need to add any few-shot examples; you just simply ask your question. The in-context learning is in the state. In other words, you can drag and drop downloaded states into your model, like literal plug-in cartridges. And note that “training” a state doesn’t require any backprop. It’s more like a highly specialised one-pass fixed-size compression algorithm. This is unlimited in-context learning applied at inference time for zero-compute or latency. 23 The structure of an effective LLM call goes from… System Prompt Preamble Few shot-examples Question …for Transformers, to simply… Inputted state (with problem context, initial instructions, textbooks, and few-shot examples) Short question …for Mamba. This is cheaper and faster than few-shot prompting (as the state is infinitely reusable without inference cost). It’s also MUCH cheaper than finetuning and doesn’t require any gradient updates. We could imagine retrieving states in addition to context. Mamba & Mechanistic Interpretability Transformer interpretability typically involves: understanding token relationships via attention, understanding circuits, and using Dictionary Learning for unfolding MLPs. Most of the ablations that we would like to do for Mamba are still valid, but understanding token communication (1) is now more nuanced. All information moves between tokens via hidden states instead of the Attention Mechanism which can “teleport” information from one sequence position to another. For understanding in-context learning (ICL) tasks with Mamba, we will look to intervene on the SSM state. A classic task in-context learning task is Indirect Object Identification in which a model has to finish a paragraph like: Then, Shelby and Emma had a lot of fun at the school. [Shelby/Emma] gave an apple to [BLANK] The model is expected to fill in the blank with the name that is not repeated in the paragraph. In the chart below we can see that information is passed from the [Shelby/Emma] position to the final position via the hidden state (see the two blue lines in the top chart). Since it’s hypothesised that much of In-Context Learning in Transformers is downstream of more primitive sequence position operations (like Induction Heads), Mamba being able to complete this task suggests a more general In-Context Learning ability. What’s Next for Mamba & SSMs? Mamba-like models are likely to excel in scenarios requiring extremely long context and long-term memory. Examples include: Processing DNA Generating (or reasoning over) video Writing novels An illustrative example is agents with long-term goals. Suppose you have an agent interacting with the world. Eventually, its experiences become too much for the context window of a transformer. The agent then has to compress or summarise its experiences into some more compact representation. But how do you decide what information is the most useful as a summary? If the task is language, LLMs are actually fairly good at summaries - okay, yeah, you’ll lose some information, but the most important stuff can be retained. However, for other disciplines, it might not be clear how to summarise. For example, what’s the best way to summarise a 2 hour movie? 24. Could the model itself learn to do this naturally rather than a hacky workaround like trying to describe the aesthetics of the movie in text? This is what Mamba allows. Actual long-term memory. A real state where the model learns to keep what’s important. Prediction is compression - learning what’s useful to predict what’s coming next inevitably leads to building a useful compression of the previous tokens. The implications for Assistants are clear: Your chatbot co-evolves with you. It remembers. The film HER is looking better and better as time goes on 😳 Agents & AI Safety One reason for positive updates in existential risk from AGI is Language Models. Previously, Deep-RL agents trained via self-play looked set to be the first AGIs. Language models are inherently much safer since they aren’t trained with long-term goals. 25 The potential for long-term sequence reasoning here brings back the importance of agent-based AI safety. Few agent worries are relevant to Transformers with an 8k context window. Many are relevant to systems with impressive long-term memories and possible instrumental goals. The Best Collab Since Taco Bell & KFC: 🤖 x 🐍 The Mamba authors show that there’s value in combining Mamba’s long context with the Transformer’s high fidelity over short sequences. For example, if you’re making long videos, you likely can’t fit a whole movie into a Transformer’s context for attention 26. You could imagine having Attention look at the most recent frames for short-term fluidity and an SSM for long-term narrative consistency 27. This isn’t the end for Transformers. Their high effectiveness is exactly what’s needed for many tasks. But now Transformers aren’t the only option. Other architectures are genuinely feasible. So we’re not in the post-Transformer era. But for the first time, we’re living in the post-only-Transformers era 28. And this blows the possibilities wide open for sequence modelling with extreme context lengths and native long-term memory. Two ML researchers, Sasha Rush (HuggingFace, Annotated Transformer, Cornell Professor) and Jonathan Frankle (Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, MosaicML, Harvard Professor), currently have a bet here. Currently Transformers are far and away in the lead. With 3 years left, there’s now a research direction with a fighting chance. All that remains to ask is: Is Attention All We Need? Thanks to Gonçalo for reading an early draft, Jaden for the nnsight library used for the Interpretability analysis and Tessa for Mamba patching visualisations.

    "commentBody": "Mamba Explained: The State Space Model Taking On Transformers (kolaayonrinde.com)239 points by koayon 17 hours agohidepastfavorite85 comments Straw 13 hours agoThe SSMs papers and blogs always have unnecessarily complicated explanations. At this point I almost wonder if its to hide how simple the underlying algorithms are, or to make them seem fancy. SSMs are doing exponentially weighted moving averages (EMA). That's it- to summarize the past, you take an EMA of a variable output at each time step. Mamba changes one key thing- instead of decaying the past by a fixed amount each step as in a constant-time EMA, we have another output which decides how much to forget, or equivalently, how much 'time' has passed since the last observation in our EMA. All of the matrix equations, continuous time, discretization, etc, will end up with a dynamic-forgetting EMA as I describe above. This also makes the benefits and limitations clear- finite state size, has to decide at a given layer what to forget before it sees the past at that layer. reply torginus 50 minutes agoparentIs this analogous to digital filters, where Transformers are the FIR filters that operate on the history of input, and IIR filters, which take past inputs into account with an exponentially decaying importance? reply binarymax 13 hours agoparentprevI hadn’t heard of Mamba before reading this article, and I was wondering if anyone has tried setting importance of a token as a TF-IDF or BM25 lookup. Requires a first pass to construct the token index but otherwise it seems like it would address the big issue that all these architectures have - they don’t know how “important” a token is. Interestingly this seems to be the crux of Mamba - deciding what tokens to forget! EMA other treats all tokens equally at sequence time. What if the tokens were weighted beforehand and the weights were passed as an attention mechanism? I wonder if anyone has tried something like this. reply halflings 12 hours agorootparentThe importance (e.g. attention) needs to be dynamic, e.g. one token will be important to some other tokens but not others. tf-idf and similar heuristics are what we were using before attention came along, e.g. tf-idf weighted bag-of-words representation of word2vec embeddings. That approaches fails in so many cases. reply binarymax 11 hours agorootparentAttention in transformers works because over time the model learns token importance based on frequency and context. If you don’t have attention and need a fast substitute for “forgetting” non important tokens, then BM25 is an intuitive hypothesis. reply curious_cat_163 10 hours agorootparentTo use your metaphor, TF-IDF will result in ‘fixed’ weights. Attention makes it so that the weights of each token can be different in each sequence of tokens. Same token gets different weights depending on who its ‘neighbors’ in the sequence end up being. This property allows the models to solve a variety of natural language problems and gets ‘used’ by the model to express context-aware dependencies. reply littlestymaar 3 hours agorootparentGiven that GP explicitly said “if you don't have attention”, and we're in a thread about a language model whose main characteristics is not to use attention, I don't understand why you insist in talking about attention … reply curious_cat_163 2 hours agorootparentI mean, if we are going to get past attention (very much on board with the idea!), then it might help to know what it is really contributing to a model. My response was trying to clarify some confusion. I am all for alternatives to attention. I don’t think BM25 cuts it. I don’t think anything that samples tokens based on BM25 weights (the idea in this subthread) would cut it. reply nelsondev 5 hours agorootparentprevNot exactly related, but in the same vein - Deep Impact - deep learning to find term impacts in the context of their document. https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12016 reply logicchains 13 hours agoparentprevAre there any fundamental differences between Mamba, Retnet and RWKV, or are they all variants of this same architecture? reply Straw 5 hours agorootparentNo, all of these use the same fundamental architecture with minor tweaks, such as the dynamic gate for mamba or an outer product paramterization of the values for RWKV-v5 reply pama 3 hours agorootparentA dynamic gate is a pretty distinct feature from previous SSM architectures in my opinion. In a sense, the overall fundamental architecture of mamba is still that of the transformer but with attention replaced by an SSM with dynamic gating. All of deep learning uses closely related ideas, but the SSM class of models took advantage of stability guarantees from integrators in control theory and created a class of RNN that don’t have to worry about exploding gradients. Mamba is one of the ways to make these SSM models much more expressive. reply ogogmad 13 hours agoparentprevThat might explain the motivation for why the Δ variable is used and varied; but not the \"Selectivity\", which the article says is expressed by how the matrices B and C vary while consuming input. Something I've noticed is that B, C and Δ depend only on the current token. See this: https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/images/mamba/ssm_algorith... -- Another thing is that I've noticed that the definition of \"SSM\" in the image I've linked to is apparently recursive.

But I prefer to think of the entire LLM space as a new scientific field that started when OpenAI released ChatGPT. In that context, all new research directions are valuable simply for the fact that they're expanding the foundation of the field. 5 years from now, who knows what the most effective models will use under the hood, but the more we can learn about them in general, the better. reply CityOfThrowaway 16 hours agorootparentThe field of research here is far older than ChatGPT's release. Neural network research has been going on for at least 50 years. Most of the research that enabled ChatGPT was also already known. \"Attention is all you need\" was a 2017 paper. It still is a fast evolving field, but not one that just kicked off. reply lettergram 15 hours agorootparentprevlol I think in general, LLM research traces its origins back to all the standard deep learning techniques: NNs, CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, etc. In 2018, with the release of transformers (via google) it enabled much more rapid training of models and more generalization with less data. 100% of the LLMs (as you’d probably thing of them)trace their origins to BERT. That said, my team was working with hundred million to low billions of parameter LSTMs & CNNs back in 2016-2017 that were comparable to some lighter weight LLMs today. In my opinion, the greatest strides in the space has less to do with the underlying architecture, and more to do with improved data formatting, accessibility and compute improvements. reply sigmoid10 16 hours agoparentprevTrue, but bear in mind the Mamba preprint is less than three months old. A lot of people are probably experimenting with these ideas right now and training a completely new, large foundation model with a different architecture will take a significant amount of time. reply imjonse 15 hours agoparentprevMost (all?) open-ish 7B+ models today are finetunes of proprietary/semi-closed/bigbudget LLMs. There is no such foundation model for Mamba yet. reply behnamoh 15 hours agoprevCan the low adoption of Mamba be attributed to what is being discussed today on HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39491863)? Basically, Nvidia et al. don't want the AI research to move in a direction that requires less GPU compute, less training data, and less inference compute. Someone on HN (I don't remember the name) mentioned that the idea of deep learning is backed by big tech because it benefits them the most as they are the only players in town with huge amounts of data. If the AI community would find entirely different approaches to AGI (maybe not even learning), who do you think would suffer the most from the implications? reply p1esk 15 hours agoparentThis doesn’t make sense - there are literally thousands of academic AI research labs who are severely limited by compute resources. If anything could work better than transformers and require less compute they would be all over that. reply behnamoh 15 hours agorootparentI guess the argument is that most AI research is supported by the big tech, and they have heavily invested in the deep learning approach.

Given the amount of VC capital deployed for this (on the order of 100s of millions), I don't believe this is a reasonable take. Sure, NVIDIA et al may not want that (although, again I don't see why... they too can't produce chips fast enough so being able to provide models for customers now ought to be good), but there's so much money out there that does... reply landryraccoon 15 hours agorootparentprevWhy would Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google want Nvidia to remain dominant in hardware?

If you can drop the compute cost of a model by 10x it means you can increase model integrity/intelligence/speed etc beyond what your compute bound competitors have.

Mamba has been out long enough that you'd already see tons of papers at arxiv showing mamba dominating transformers in all sorts of applications. But that's not happening, despite the ton of hype.

Publishing is an extremely noisy process in ML and is getting increasingly difficult for smaller non big tech collaborating labs. Reviewers' go to are: more datasets, scale, not novel. The easiest way to approach this is to work off of pretrained models. This is probably more obvious in the NLP world. I agree that Mamba doesn't solve everything and it still needs work.

This is incredibly naive with absolutely no scientific basis. There is no evidence that this is in scale of data nor scale of architecture. There are a number of animals with larger brains in terms of both mass and total number of neurons. An African Elephant has roughly 3x the number of neurons humans have.

Neanderthals might have been smarter than us, but went extinct for reasons not related to intelligence.

Scale. Your argument is inconsistent. Very clearly everything isn't scale or we'd use other things besides transformers. Different architectures scale in different ways and everything has different inductive biases. No one doubts scale is important, but there's a lot more. reply p1esk 12 hours agorootparentScale is all we need for transformers (so far). It might also be all we need for ape brains. It’s not all we need for whatever elephant or dolphin brains evolved from. When this stops being the case for transformers, we will need something else. I’m just pointing out it’s not the case yet. reply godelski 12 hours agorootparentI see no evidence of this in biology nor in ML. I've read those scale papers. I've worked on scale myself. I'll bet the farm that scale isn't all you need. But I won't be surprised if people say that it is all scale. If you really think it is all scale, train a 7T ResNet MLP based model for NLP. If scale is all you need, make a LLM without DPO or RLHF. If scale is all you need, make SD3 with a GAN. Or what about a VAE, Normalizing Flow, HMM? Do it with different optimizers. Do it with gradient free methods. Do it with different loss functions. The bitter lesson wasn't \"scale is all you need.\" That's just a misinterpretation. Edit: It's fine to disagree. We can compete on the ideas and methods. That's good for our community. So continue down yours, and I'll continue down mine. All I ask is that since your camp is more popular, you don't block those on my side. If you're right, we'll get to AGI soon. If we're right, we still might. But if we're right and you all block us, we'll get another AI winter in between. If we're right and you all don't block us, we can progress without skipping a beat. Just don't put all your eggs in one basket. It isn't good for anyone. reply p1esk 12 hours agorootparentI said “scale is all you need for transformers”. That has been true since GPT1.

The quadratic bottleneck is due to the lower bounds of exhaustive search. The papers on this only ever seem to reference perplexity.

There is no free lunch, and this project hasn't shown that the costs are acceptable. \"I'm going to the beach\" + house Doesn't help if what you needed was \"I'm going to the beach\" + tomorrow I do hope that there is more information on the costs, or that they have disproven SETH soon. reply soVeryTired 14 hours agorootparentWhat's SETH in this context?

I'm seeing the Mamba paper as the `Attention Is All You Need` of Mamba - it might take a little while before we get everything optimised to the point of a GPT-4 (it took 6 years for transformers but should be faster than that now with all the attention on ML) reply koayon 14 hours agorootparentprevAnother interesting one is that the hardware isn't really optimised for Mamba yet either - ideally we'd want more of the fast SRAM so that we can store more larger hidden states efficiently reply godelski 15 hours agoparentprevYes and no. The thing is that Mamba is not perfect. There's no neural architecture to rule them all, if you will. I think the bigger issue is that we more act like there is and get on bandwagons. Let me give a clearer example from the past so we can see. The predecessor to DDPM (the work that kicked off the diffusion model era) was published in 2015[0], only a year after GANs[1]. Diffusion then showed promise but why did DDPM come out in 2020[2]? Because everyone was working on GANs. GANs produced far better images and diffusion (still is) was a lot more computationally intensive. Plus, all the people working on these diffusion models were in the same camp as those working on Normalizing Flows and other density based models, and fewer people are interested in understanding density estimation. So the entire problem is that the community hopped on a singular railroad for research direction. There was still working going on in that direction but it wasn't nearly getting the attention that GANs got. It's hard to know if things were blocked from publication because they weren't as good as GANs. I can say from personal experience I had a Flow publication blocked because reviewers were concerned with its quality compared to GANs (this was 2019/2020, this paper will never be published because now it is even hard to publish a GAN work). So yes and no because there is certainly railroading happening but there are also real critiques to Mamba. But what people often forget is that it is incredibly naive to compare new methods to existing methods on a direct one-to-one comparison. You're comparing something that has hundreds of hours to thousands of hours from a handful to a few dozen eyes against works with millions of hours and millions of eyes. Evaluation is just a really fucking hard thing to do but it is easy to just look at some benchmarks, even if they don't mean much. This is a fairly generalization notion though, so take the lesson to heart. But Mamba seems a bit different than our diffusion/GAN story, in that it is getting more attention than diffusion did in the 2016-2019.

    "originBody": "Home Screen Advantage Decoding Apple's Desperate Ploy To Scuttle PWAs February 25, 2024 This is part nine of the nine-part series \"Browser Choice Must Matter\" After weeks of confusion and intentional chaos, Apple's plan to kneecap the web has crept into view, menacing a PWApocalypse as the March 6th compliance deadline approaches for the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The view from Cupertino. The DMA requires Apple to open the iPhone to competing app stores, and and its lopsided proposal for \"enabling\" them is getting most of the press. But Apple knows it has native stores right where it wants them. Cupertino's noxious requirements will take years to litigate. Meanwhile, potential competitors are only that. But Cupertino can't delay the DMA's other mandate: real browsers, downloaded from Apple's own app store. Since it can't keep them from emerging, it's trying to raise costs on competitors and lower their potential to disrupt Apple's cozy monopoly. How? By geofencing browser choice and kneecapping web apps, all while gaslighting users about who is breaking their web apps. The immediate impact of iOS 17.4 in the EU will be broken apps and lost data, affecting schools, governments, startups, gamers, and anyone else with the temerity to look outside the one true app store for even a second. None of this is required by the DMA, as demonstrated by the persistence of both PWAs and important features they enable on Windows and Android, both of which are in the same regulatory boat. The data loss will be catastrophic for many, as will the removal of foundational features. Here's what it looks like today, and what Apple's proposing to do: PWA Capability Windows Android iOS 17.3 iOS 17.4 App-like UI ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Settings Integration ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Reliable Storage ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Push Notifications ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Icon Badging ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Share-to PWA ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ App Shortcuts ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ Device APIs ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ Apple's support for powerful web apps wasn't stellar, but this step in the wrong direction will just so happen to render PWAs useless to worldwide businesses looking to reach EU users. Apple's interpretation of the DMA appears to be that features not available on March 6th don't need to be shared with competitors, and it doesn't want to share web apps. The solution almost writes itself: sabotage PWAs ahead of the deadline and give affected users, businesses, and competitors minimal time to react. Cupertino's not just trying to vandalise PWAs and critical re-engagement features for Safari; it's working to prevent any browser from ever offering them on iOS. If Apple succeeds in the next two weeks, it will cement a future in which the mobile web will never be permitted to grow beyond marketing pages for native apps. By hook or by crook, Apple's going to maintain its home screen advantage. The business goal is obvious: force firms back into the app store Apple taxes and out of the only ecosystem it can't — at least not directly. Apple's justifications range from unfalsifiable smokescreens to blatant lies, but to know it you have to have a background in browser engineering and the DMA's legalese. The rest of this post will provide that context. Apologies in advance for the length. If you'd like to stop reading here, take with you the knowledge that Cupertino's attempt to scuttle PWAs under cover of chaos is exactly what it appears to be: a shocking attempt to keep the web from ever emerging as a true threat to the App Store and blame regulators for Apple's own malicious choices. And they just might get away with it if we don't all get involved ASAP. Chaos Monkey Business But Wait! There's More! What's At Risk? Not With A Bang, But With A Beta Lies, Damned Lies, and \"Still, we regret...\" The Point The Mask Is Off Chaos Monkey Business # Two weeks ago, Apple sprung its EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plans on the world as a fait accomplis.

This tactic tries to set Apple's proposal as a negotiating baseline, forcing competitors to burn time and money arguing down plainly unacceptable terms before they can enter the market. For native app store hopefuls, this means years of expensive disputes before they can begin to access an already geofenced market. This was all wrapped in a peevish, belligerant presentation, which the good folks over at The Platform Law Blog have covered in depth. Much of the analysis has focused on the raw deal Apple is offering native app store competitors, missing the forest for the trees: the threat Apple can't delay by years comes from within. Deep in the sub-basement of Apple's tower of tomfoolery are APIs and policies that purport to enable browser engine choice. If you haven't been working on browsers for 15 years, the terms might seem reasonable, but to these eyes they're anything but. OWA has a lengthy dissection of the tricks Apple's trying to pull. Apple's message of hope and optimism for a better web. The proposals are maximally onerous, but you don't have to take my word for it; here's Mozilla: We are ... extremely disappointed with Apple’s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps. The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear. Apple’s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari. This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS. — Mozilla spokesperson The obvious strategy is to raise costs and lower the value of porting browsers to iOS. Other browser vendors have cited exactly these concerns when asked about plans to bring their best products to iOS. Apple's play is to engineer an unusable alternative then cite the lack of adoption to other regulators as proof that mandating real engine choice is unwise. Instead of facilitating worldwide browser choice in good faith, Apple's working to geofence progress; classic \"divide and conquer\" stuff, justified with serially falsified security excuses. Odious, brazen, and likely in violation of the DMA, but to the extent that it will now turn into a legal dispute, that's a feature (not a bug) from Apple's perspective. When you're the monopolist, delay is winning. But Wait! There's More! # All of this would be stock FruitCo doing anti-competitive FruitCo things, but they went further, attempting to silently shiv PWAs and blame regulators for it. And they did it in the dead of the night, silently disabling important features as close to the DMA compliance deadline as possible. It's challenging, verging on impossible, to read this as anything but extrordinary bad faith, but Apple's tactics require context to understand. The DMA came into force in 2022, putting everyone (including Apple) on notice that their biggest platforms and products would probably be \"designated\", and after designation, they would have six months to \"comply\". The first set of designation decisions went out last Sept, obligating Android, Windows, iOS, Chrome, and Safari to comply no later than March 6th, 2024. Apple tried everything to shrink the scope of enforcement and delay compliance, but in the end had the same two-years of notice and six-months warning from designation as everyone else. A maximally aggressive legal interpretation might try to exploit ambiguity in what it means to comply and when responsibilities actually attach. Does compliance mean providing open and fair access starting from when iOS and Safari were designated, or does compliance obligation only attach six months later? The DMA's text is not ironclad here: 10: The gatekeeper shall comply with the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 within 6 months after a core platform service has been listed in the designation decision pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article. DMA Article 3, Clause 10 Firms looking to comply maliciously might try to remove troublesome features just before a compliance deadline, then argue they don't need to share them with competitors becuse they weren't available before the deadline set in. Apple looks set to argue, contra everyone else subject to the DMA, that the moment from which features must be made interoperable is the end of the fair-warning period, not the date of designation. This appears to be Apple's play, and it stinks to high heavens. What's At Risk? # Apple's change isn't merely cosmetic. In addition to immediate data loss, FruitCo's change will destroy: App-like UI: Web apps are no longer going to look or work like apps in the task manager, systems settings, or any other surface. Homescreen web apps will be demoted to tabs in the default browser. Reliable storage: PWAs were the only exemption to Apple's (frankly silly) seven day storage eviction policy, meaning the last safe harbour for anyone trying to build a serious, offline-first experience just had the rug pulled out from under them. Push Notifications: Remember how Apple gaslit web developers over Web Push for the best part of a decade? And remember how, when they finally got around to it, they did a comically inept job of it? And recall all the fretting and worry about how shite your Push Notifications look and work for iOS users as a result? Well, rest easy, because they're going away and you won't have to worry your pretty little head any more. App Icon Badging: A kissing cousin of Push, Icon Badging allows PWAs to ambiently notify users of new messages, something iOS native apps have been able to do for nearly 15 years. Removal of one would be a crisis. Together? Apple's engineering the PWApocalypse. You can't build credible mobile experiences without these features. A social network without notifications? A notetaking app that randomly loses data? Businesses will get the message worldwide: if you want to be on the homescreen and deliver services that aren't foundationally compromised, the only game in town is Apple's app store. Apple understands even the most aggressive legal theories about DMA timing wouldn't support kneecapping PWAs after March 6th. Even if you believe (as I do) their obligations attached back in September, there's at least an argument to be tested. Cupertino's white-shoe litigators would be laughed out of court and Apple would get fined ridiculous amounts for non-compliance after trying to deny these features to other browsers after the end of the fair-warning period. To preserve the argument for litigation, it was necessary to do the dirty deed ahead of the last plausible deadline. Not With A Bang, But With A Beta # The first indication something was amiss was a conspicuous lack of APIs for PWA support in the documentation for obviously long-baking BrowserEngineKit, released on Feb 1st alongside Apple's peevish, deeply misleading note that attempted to whitewash malicious compliance in a thin coat of security theatre. Two days later, after developers inside the EU got their hands on the iOS 17.4 Beta, word started to leak out that PWAs were broken. Nothing about the change was documented in iOS Beta or Safari release notes. Developers filed plaintive bugs and some directly pinged Apple employees, but Cupertino remained shtum. This created panic and confustion as the window for DMA compliance and the inevitable iOS 17.4 final release closed. Two more betas followed, but no documentation or acknowledgement of the \"bug.\" Changes to the broken PWA behavior were introduced, but Apple failed to acknowledge the issue or confirm that it was intentional (and therefore likely to persist). After two weeks of growing panic from web developers, Apple finally copped to intentionally crippling the only open, tax-free competitor to the app store. Apple's Feb 15th statement is a masterclass in deflection and deceit. To understand why requires a deep understanding of browsers internals and how Apple's closed PWA — sorry, \"home screen web app\" — system for iOS works. TL;DR? Apple's cover story is horseshit, stem to stern. Cupertino oughta be ashamed and we web developers are excused for glowing with incandescent rage over being used as pawns; first ignored, then gaslit, and finally betrayed. Lies, Damned Lies, and \"Still, we regret...\" # I really, really hate to do this, but Brandolini's Law dictates that to refute Apple's bullshit, I'm going to need to go through their gibberish excuses line-by-line to explain and translate. This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you. Q: Why don’t users in the EU have access to Home Screen web apps? Translation: \"Why did you break functionality that has been a foundational part of iOS since 2007?\" To comply with the Digital Markets Act, Apple has done an enormous amount of engineering work to add new functionality and capabilities for developers and users in the European Union — including more than 600 new APIs and a wide range of developer tools. Translation: \"We're so very tired, you see. All of this litigating to avoid compliance tuckered us right out. Plus, those big meanies at the EU made us do work. It's all very unfair.\" It goes without saying, but Apple's burden to add APIs it should have long ago provided for competing native app stores has no bearing whatsoever on its obligation to provide fair access to APIs that browser competitors need. Apple also had the same two years warning as everyone else. It knew this was coming, and special pleading at the 11th hour has big \"the dog ate my homework\" energy. The iOS system has traditionally provided support for Home Screen web apps by building directly on WebKit and its security architecture. That integration means Home Screen web apps are managed to align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS, including isolation of storage and enforcement of system prompts to access privacy impacting capabilities on a per-site basis. Finally! A recitation of facts. Yes, iOS has historically forced a pretty busted model on PWAs, but iOS is not unique in providing system settings integration for PWAs. Indeed, many OSes have created the sort of integration infrastructure that Apple describes. These systems leave the question of how PWAs are actually run (and where their storage lives) to the browser that installs them, and the sky has yet to fall. Apple is trying to gussy up their mere preferences as hard requirements without any reasonable justification. Here we see the outline of a strawman; Apple is insinuating that it can't provide API surface areas to allow the sorts of integrations that others already have. Why? Because it might involve writing a lot of code. Bless their hearts. Without this type of isolation and enforcement, malicious web apps could read data from other web apps and recapture their permissions to gain access to a user’s camera, microphone or location without a user’s consent. Keeping one website from abusing permissions or improperly accessing data from another website is what browsers do. It's a browser's one job. Correctly separating princpals is the very defintion of a \"secure\" browser. Every single browser vendor (save Apple) treats subversion of the Same Origin Policy as a showstopping bug to be fixed ASAP. Unbelieveable amounts of engineering go to ensuring browsers overlay stronger sandboxing and more restrictive permissions on top of the universally weaker OS security primitives — iOS very much included. Browser makers have become masters of origin separation because they run totally untrusted code from all over the internet. Security is paramount because browsers have to be paranoid. They can't just posture about how store reviews will keep users safe; they have to do the work. Good browsers separate web apps better than bad ones, which makes it particularly rich that Apple of all vendors is directly misleading this way. Apple's decade+ of under-investment in Safari ensured it was much less prepared for Spectre and Meltdown and Solar Winds that alternaties on other OSes. Competing engines had invested hundreds of engineer years into more advanced Site Isolation technology than Apple had, and the iOS browser engine monoculture has put users at risk over and over again as a result. With that as background, we can start to unpack Apple's garbled claim. What Cupertino is alluding to here is that it does not want to create APIs for syncing permission state that would enable the thin shim apps every PWA-supporting OS uses to make website \"first class\" in the OS — including iOS today. Further, it doesn't want to add APIs for attributing storage use, or clearing state, or other common management tasks. If those APIs existed, Apple would still have a management question, which it's misdirections also allude to. But these aren't a problem in practice either. Every browser that would offer PWA support would happily sign up to security terms that required accurate synchronization of permission state between OS surfaces and web origins, in exactly the same way they'd dutifully treat cross-origin subversion as a fatal bug to be hot-fixed. Apple's excusemaking is a mirror of Cupertino's years of scaremongering about alternate browser engine security, only to take up my proposal more-or-less wholesale when the rubber hit the road. Nothing about this is monumental to build or challenging to manage; FruitCo's just hoping you don't know better. And why would you? The set of people who understand these details generously number in the low dozens. Browsers also could install web apps on the system without a user’s awareness and consent. Apple know this is a lie. They retain full control over the system APIs that are called to add icons to the homescreen, install apps, and much else. They can shim in interstitial UI if they feel like doing so. If iOS left this to Safari and did not include these sorts precautions, those are choices Apple has made and has been given two years notice to fix. Cuptertino seems to be saying \"bad things might happen if we continued to do a shit job\" and one can't help but agree. However, that's no way out of the DMA's obligations. Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps. [CITATION NEEDED] Once again, Apple is counting on the opacity of it's own suppression of the web to keep commenters from understanding the game that's afoot. Through an enervating combination of strategic underinvestment and coerced monoculture, Apple created (and still maintains) a huge gap in discoverability and friction for installing web apps vs. their native competition. Stacking the deck for native has taken many forms: Preventing web apps from gaining distribution in the app store by explicit policy. \"Smart Banners\" that let sites easily offer installation of their native counterparts. Steadfast refusal to implement analagous features for PWAs or provide competing browsers the OS and DOM APIs they need to do so. Burying Web App installation behind a \"Share Sheet\" UI that users and developers complain is incredibly hard to discover, forcing site owners to build clunky intersitials. Denying competitors the necessary API access to offer better install UI and only providing the underwhelming \"Share Sheet\" option last year, a full 15 years after Safari could. This campaign of suppression has been widly effective. If users don't know they can install PWAs, it's because Safari never tells them, and until this time last year, neither could any other browser. Developers also struggled to justify building them because Apple's repression extended to neglect of critical features, opening and maininting a substantial capability gap. If PWAs use on iOS is low, that's a consequence of Apple's own actions. On every other OS where I've seen the data, not only are PWAs a success, they are growing rapidly. Perhaps that's why Apple feels a need to mislead by omission and fail to provide data to back their claim. And so, to comply with the DMA’s requirements, we had to remove the Home Screen web apps feature in the EU. Bullshit. Apple's embedded argument expands to: We don't want to comply with the plain-letter language of the law. To avoid that, we've come up with a legal theory of compliance that's favourable to us. To comply with that (dubious) theory, and to avoid doing any of the work we don't want to do, we've been forced to bump off the one competitor we can't tax. Neat, tidy, and comprised entirely of bovine excrement. EU users will be able to continue accessing websites directly from their Home Screen through a bookmark with minimal impact to their functionality. We expect this change to affect a small number of users. Still, we regret any impact this change — that was made as part of the work to comply with the DMA — may have on developers of Home Screen web apps and our users. Translation: \"Because fuck you, that's why\" Apple is under no obligation by the DMA's terms to nuke PWAs. Windows and Android will continue supporting PWAs just fine. Apple apparently hopes it can convince you to blame regulators for its own choices. Cupertino's counting the element of surprise plus the press's poorly developed understanding of the situation to keep blowback from snowballing into effective oppostion. The Point # There's no possible way to justify a \"Core Technology Fee\" tax on an open, interoperable, standardsized platform that competitors would provide secure implementations of for free. What Apple's attempting isn't just some hand-wavey removal of a \"low use\" feature ([CITATION NEEDED]), it's sabotage of the only credible alternative to its app store monopoly. A slide from Apple's presentation in Apple v. Epic, attempting to make the claim Epic could have just made a PWA if they didn't like the App Store terms because circa '20 Safari was so capable. LOL. Businesses will get the message: from now on, the only reliable way to get your service under the thumb, or in the notification tray, of the most valuable users in the world is to capitulate to Apple's extortionate App Store taxes. If the last 15 years are anything to judge by, developers will take longer to understand what's going on, but this is an attempt to pull a \"Thoughts on Flash\" for the web. Apple's suppression of the web has taken many forms over the past decade, but the common thread has been inaction and anti-competitive scuppering of more capable engines. With one of those pillars crumbling, the knives glint a bit more brightly. This is Apple once and for all trying to relegate web development skills to the dustbin of the desktop. Not only will Apple render web apps unreliable for Safari users, FruitCo is setting up an argument to prevent competitors from ever delivering features that challenge the app store in future. And it doesn't care who it hurts along the way. The Mask Is Off # This is exactly what it looks like: a single-fingered salute to the web and web developers. The removal of features that allowed the iPhone to exist at all. The end of Steve Jobs' promise that you'd be able to make great apps out of HTML, CSS, and JS. For the past few years Apple has gamely sent $1,600/hr lawyers and astroturf lobbyists to argue it didn't need to be regulated. That Apple was really on the developer's side. That even if it overstepped occasionally, it was all in the best interest of users. Tell that to the millions of EU PWA users about to lose data. Tell that to the public services built on open technology. Tell it to the businesses that will fold, having sweated to deliver compelling experiences using the shite tools Apple web developers. Apple's rug pull is anti-user, anti-developer, and anti-competition. Now we see the whole effort in harsh relief. A web Apple can't sandbag and degrade is one it can't abide. FruitCo's fear and loathing of an open platform it can't tax is palpable. The lies told to cover for avarice are ridiculous — literally, \"worthy of ridicule\". It's ok to withhold the benefit of the doubt from Safari and Apple. It's ok to be livid. These lies aren't little or white; they're directly aimed at our future. They're designed to influence the way software will be developed and delivered for decades to come. If you're as peeved about this as I am, go join OWA in the fight and help them create the sort of pressure in the next 10 days that might actually stop a monopolist with money on their mind.

I'm amazed, given how well informed this crowd typically is. As for the topic being discussed - Apple have gone out of their way for the last _decade_ to avoid implementing things like ServiceWorkers properly. I remember having this same conversation back in 2015. It is a real shame, as things like the proposed w3c sensors api would totally eliminate the pain of deploying private/internal/enterprise apps to a fleet of employees, for example. There is so much that this enables for private apps. I won't be surprised if their decade+ old viewport meta tag reference documentation for home screen icons and status bar styling in full screen mode stops working at some point too - it's been neglected for years. It'll be a weird, heartbreaking example of corporate revisionism, especially considering Steve Jobs' original vision for apps on the iphone. I'm not a huge fan of the big G either, but I honestly hope they take advantage of this with some clever (non-developer) product-centric marketing. PWAs are a very well thought out approach to 90% of what modern apps are. We absolutely should be sandboxing private browser instances per PWA, not shipping entire separate webkit wrappers for every app every time an app is updated. It's almost literally the same difference as shipping layered container images as updates instead of giant VM blobs. Such a huge loss. reply zmmmmm 29 minutes agoprevI hope the EU calls them on this and mandates that they offer equivalent OS API support for 3rd party browsers to implement PWAs to what Safari had at the time their initial ruling was made. Let's then watch how fast Apple restores PWA capabilities to Safari when web sites are actively encouraging users to install third party browsers so that PWA's keep working. reply phartenfeller 1 hour agoprevI think removing persistent storage and the ability to add websites to the home screen makes it obvious what their strategy is. The EU shows that they want interoperability for big players like they do with messenger interoperability in the DMA. The web is such a fundamental standard and its interoperability is so important I guess the EU will fine Apple for such behavior. The question is how soon this will happen. reply JimDabell 1 hour agoparent> Removing persistent storage They aren’t making any policy changes relating to storage. Apple have been progressively locking down methods websites use to persistently track people for privacy reasons. All forms of permanent storage (e.g. cookies, local storage) are limited to a seven day lifetime unless the user interacts with that website / web app. If the user keeps visiting the website / web app at least once a week, the storage remains. Another thing Apple have been doing is using the act of installing a PWA as a signal that it should be trusted more than anything you happen to come across in a browser. So the seven day lifecycle doesn’t apply to PWAs that you install to the home screen. What is happening now is that because PWAs installed to the home screen are no longer available in the EU, people use those PWAs through a web browser. And due to this, the seven days lifetime without user interaction starts to apply. It’s a problem, but this specific thing isn’t a recent policy change from Apple regarding storage, it’s fallout from PWAs not having the elevated privileges from being installed to the home screen. reply lo0dot0 27 minutes agorootparentThey could just make cookies a user choice, but it's Apple we are talking about here, it's all about hard coding and hand holding. reply the_gipsy 58 minutes agorootparentprevSo - effectively, apple is crippling PWAs exactly as being said.

If an origin has no user interaction, such as click or tap, in the last seven days of browser use, its data created from script will be deleted. Cookies set by server are exempt from this eviction. It doesn't matter what the data actually is or whether it is used to track users. Safari deletes it. reply veeti 15 minutes agorootparentprevIt really makes me wonder what makes people engage in such pointless semantic handwringing like this. Your comment even acknowledges the end result: support for PWA's and as a result persistent storage has been removed.

Yes, they're both shitty in a number of ways. And while is is easier to root Android devices than it is to root iOS ones, last I checked you were still dependent on the vendor kernel and parts of the vendor display server on Android because not all of the necessary drivers and related config are upstreamed (and the lack of TIVO clauses in GPLv2 makes this possible) - meaning replacing 95% of userspace doesn't actually get you very far if your issue is not being able to trust the vendor. I choose Apple because: 1. Apple is primarily a hardware company. When I buy their hardware, I am their customer. When they make noises about protecting my privacy, I am reasonably confident that very few parts of the business are working to undermine that. OTOH, Google is an advertising company. When I buy their hardware, my eyeballs become their product, which they rent out to their real customers, the advertisers. When they make noises about protecting my privacy, I see that as mostly marketing BS (or, \"puffery\") which large parts of their business are working to undermine. 2. My phone is not my primary computing device. I have a laptop running GNU/Linux that I use for most of my computing needs, including web browsing, email, and software development. I am fine with my mobile phone being an \"appliance\" that I use mostly for instant messaging, and occasionally checking the news and weather, taking photos, or making short temporary notes that I will (manually) transfer to my laptop later. And sometimes, even, making phone calls. But I generally stay away from \"apps\". No, I don't want to install your fucking app, no matter which device it would be on. Just make sure your website works. Given those factors, I have an Apple phone. That's not to say Apple is for everyone. My priorities are not everyone else's, and that's fine.

Why would anyone think side loading is supported when you can't open the app anymore after 7 days? More likely to be iOS apologists looking for a narrative, they try it out and proclaim that it works, but have no intention to actually use their side loaded test app, so they don't even realize it only looked like it worked. reply boxed 1 hour agoparentprevCreating your own app is actually pretty easy on iOS. I run an app on my phone right now that I built myself and that is not on the app store. reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentIt's not easy, you need a multithousand dollar apple machine, and you can't share this app with anybody else. reply JimDabell 1 hour agorootparentNo, you don’t. You need a Mac, but you don’t need to buy one. You can use a free tier on a build service like Bitrise if you don’t have a Mac. reply the_gipsy 53 minutes agorootparentPerhaps technically possible, but in practice it's against apple development directives. I doubt you do this yourself, or know anyone that actually develops iOS apps from a non-mac in the real world. And you still can't share that app. reply JimDabell 49 minutes agorootparent> in practice it's against apple development directives. Most professional iOS developers use these kinds of services. They are totally commonplace and not against Apple’s terms in the slightest. reply the_gipsy 27 minutes agorootparentI feel you're being disingenuous. Close to zero professional iOS developers develop on a non-mac. reply JimDabell 13 minutes agorootparentThere isn’t a part of Apple’s terms where they say you are only allowed to use build servers if you are a professional iOS developer.

However there is a fairly short time line (I think a week?), after which you have to reinstall it. It’s designed for running apps on your device as you are developing them, not as a long-term deployment method. reply shrx 2 hours agoparentprevIt's not that easy on Android either. Rooting usually requires a factory reset and several apps (e.g. banking) will not work if they detect the system is rooted. edit: Also, in some cases you lose warranty. reply rezonant 3 minutes agorootparentThere is no need to root to install software on Android. Rooting is only required for permissions that no app (save pre installed apps), whether installed via Play store or not, can be given. reply xorcist 1 hour agorootparentprevInstalling F-Droid is not hard. No need for root. In fact, the usual criticism is that it's too easy. There are a number of scary warnings to click through but that's it. Not great for security but the official distribution is good enough that it's not a problem outside a few select countries where doing business is hard. reply pooper 1 hour agorootparentprevThe fact that you can't install apps from your own xcode and run locally (used to be at all now I guess seven day limit) is silly. On Android, with Android 12, we can now have apps on neostore (fdroid frontend) auto update. There is no good reason to defend apple here. You as a user are always free to not install third party app stores. reply BHSPitMonkey 1 hour agorootparentThe official F-Droid client has auto updates, too, for what it's worth. reply pooper 1 hour agorootparentThis is good to know.

Having a concept of a super user which can do whatever they want is bad for security and doesn't follow the principle of least privilege. There are better ways for an OS to offer functionality than requiring such a dangerous concept to exist. The fact that desktop and server Linux distros still have a root account, have sudo, or said binaries is evidence of how far behind they are in terms of security. reply rezonant 1 minute agorootparentMacOS also has sudo. reply aragilar 1 hour agoprevNot an IPhone user: but honesty I'd rather have things open an actual browser tab, as then I can interact with it via all my standard extensions (e.g. adblockers), rather than be opened in a webview. Also, given how often you need to change phones (given build quality), if I have important data and you're a web app, I rather the server be the source of truth, and the phone a cache (so I don't loose data when the phone breaks). reply fuzzy2 20 minutes agoparentI’d like to quickly address the second paragraph. From my experience, iPhones last until their software support runs out, barring any accidents. Furthermore, PWAs need not be offline applications (so TFA overblows the data loss potential ever so slightly) but often work exactly like you want them to. I use the Outlook PWA. It’s great because I don’t have to let my company manage (part of) my phone. reply beardyw 1 hour agoparentprevWeb apps are mostly optional and otherwise work as a normal web site. Differences are that some functions are exclusive to web apps, so you wouldn't get them on a web site anyway. A feature I do find annoying is the ability to save a page onto my (Android) phone screen is taken away and replaced by \"install app\". I work around that by going into airplane mode, fetching the page unsuccessfully, and saving that! reply aragilar 1 hour agorootparentThat doesn't mean they don't have ads, or other things I want to work around. reply kilburn 48 minutes agorootparentThe point is that with EU mandating alt-browsers on iOS, it should have been a possibility to have \"Installed\" (home-)PWAs where the engine is the alt-browser, not safari/webview. Those browsers could have implemented the Home-PWA functionality while maintaining your ability to install plugins such as adblockers within that PWA's context. Apple has made this impossible by removing the OS APIs that allowed \"Installed\" (home-)PWAs entirely. This is just so they aren't forced to allow these under a different browser engine. Of course, this is all done because \"think of the children\" (i.e.: think of the poor people ticked into using a non-privacy-respecting browser to run their PWAs). reply sspiff 1 hour agoparentprevThis should be an option for the user then, like \"Install\" (as a PWA) or \"Add bookmark to home screen\" (as a browser tap). There's reasons to want either, but as a heavy user of PWAs for a few online services / communities, I much prefer the former in most cases. reply sebstefan 45 minutes agoparentprevWith Firefox Mobile on Android, you can confiure webviews to open as Firefox webviews as well, and my extensions seem to be running because I don't see ads there. They're still webviews of course, you don't get the tabs, bookmarks etc. Just webviews with extension support. reply rambambram 18 minutes agoprevAlthough I agree with the article and the obvious sh!t move Apple is making, one needs to keep making a distinction between PWAs and web apps in general. Not every 'web app' needs local storage or push notifications. Besides, I heard the 'simple' web apps still can have a place on the homescreen. Can anybody with an iPhone tell me if that works like the video from the article? Is it just with an address bar? reply fuzzy2 0 minutes agoparentThe video in the article (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AST12aDGf0Q) shows that PWAs are completely gone. They are degraded to pinned bookmarks that open in your default browser. Yes, you can still pin bookmarks, as you always(?) could, but those are not PWAs. Only PWAs can offer a true app-like experience. reply timwaagh 42 minutes agoprevThere's fortunately no need to use any apple products. The ones most hurt by this will probably be Apple.

Now that option is going away, so I can understand if people who previously relied on it are ticked off. reply makeitdouble 2 hours agorootparentYes, it is the \"Minimum Functionality\" requirement , still in the books: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#min... > 4.2 Minimum Functionality > Your app should include features, content, and UI that elevate it beyond a repackaged website.

I was under the impression that as long as they removed PWAs before the final deadline, they'd be able to claim they were complying in good faith. But I suppose that might not be true, and it could actually be as-of the warning period? reply jeroenhd 1 hour agoparentLike with the GDPR, the DMA had a long lead-in time in which the law has gone into effect but the EU wasn't prosecuting anyone for incompliance yet. The designation took place half a year ago but you can't expect companies to act on a rough draft and unmade commission decisions, so while the right EU people got started, nobody needed to comply yet. Of course Apple could've acted earlier out of the goodness of their hearts and to serve customer interests (lol), but like with the GDPR, companies tend to prepare longer and only launch their changes right when they're about to see any real risk. The end of the fair warning period is the final deadline. Microsoft and Google are doing the same thing, I think it's to be expected with regulation like this, and the regulation was designed for this. reply reactordev 2 hours agoprevThere’s a whole lot of “what ifs” and conjecture on a possible future that hasn’t happened yet.

    "title": "Aldous Huxley Warns of Modern Pleasure Dangers",
    "originLink": "https://hackneybooks.co.uk/books/364/686/Pleasures.html",
    "originBody": "Pleasures by Aldous Huxley We have heard a great deal, since 1914, about the things which are a menace to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism; then the Germans at large; then the prolongation of the war; then the shortening of the same; then, after a time, the Treaty of Versailles; then French militarism - with, all the while, a running accompaniment of such minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe, Mr. Bryan, Comstockery.... Civilization, however, has resisted the combined attacks of these enemies wonderfully well. For still, in 1923, it stands not so very far from where it stood in that \"giant age before the flood\" of nine years since. Where, in relation to Neanderthal on the one hand and Athens on the other, where precisely it stood then is a question which each may answer according to his taste. The important fact is that these menaces to our civilization, such as it is - menaces including the largest war and the stupidest peace known to history - have confined themselves in most places and up till now to mere threats, barking more furiously than they bite. No, the dangers which confront our civilization are not so much the external dangers - wild men, wars and the bankruptcy that wars bring after them. The most alarming dangers are those which menace it from within, that threaten the mind rather than the body and estate of contemporary man. Of all the various poisons which modern civilization, by a process of auto-intoxication, brews quietly up within its own bowels, few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while none appears more harmless) than that curious and appalling thing that is technically known as \"pleasure.\" \"Pleasure\" (I place the word between inverted commas to show that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized activities officially known by the same name) \"pleasure\" - what nightmare visions the word evokes! Like every man of sense and good feeling, I abominate work. But I would rather put in eight hours a day at a Government office than be condemned to lead a life of \"pleasure\"; I would even, I believe, prefer to write a million words of journalism a year. The horrors of modern \"pleasure\" arise from the fact that every kind of organized distraction tends to become progressively more and more imbecile. There was a time when people indulged themselves with distractions requiring the expense of a certain intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century, for example, royal personages and their courtiers took a real delight in listening to erudite sermons (Dr. Donne's, for example) and academical disputes on points of theology or metaphysics. Part of the entertainment offered to the Prince Palatine, on the occasion of his marriage with James 1.'s daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on I forget what philosophical theme, between the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a troop of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine the feelings of a contemporary prince, if a loyal University were to offer him a similar entertainment! Royal personages were not the only people who enjoyed intelligent pleasures. In Elizabethan times every lady and gentleman of ordinary culture could be relied upon, at demand, to take his or her part in a madrigal or a motet. Those who know the enormous complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century music will realize what this means. To indulge in their favourite pastime our ancestors had to exert their minds to an uncommon degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted in pleasures requiring the exercise of a certain intelligence, individuality and personal initiative. They listened, for example, to Othello, King Lear, and Hamlet - apparently with enjoyment and comprehension. They sang and made much music. And far away, in the remote country, the peasants, year by year, went through the traditional rites - the dances of spring and summer, the winter mummings, the ceremonies of harvest home - appropriate to each successive season. Their pleasures were intelligent and alive, and it was they who, by their own efforts, entertained themselves. We have changed all that. In place of the old pleasures demanding intelligence and personal initiative, we have vast organizations that provide us with ready-made distractions - distractions which demand from pleasure-seekers no personal participation and no intellectual effort of any sort. To the interminable democracies of the world a million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash. There have always been fourth-rate writers and dramatists; but their works, in the past, quickly died without getting beyond the boundaries of the city or the country in which they appeared. To-day, the inventions of the scenario-writer go out from Los Angeles across the whole world. Countless audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of them, no participation; they need only sit and keep their eyes open. Do the democracies want music? In the old days they would have made it themselves. Now, they merely turn on the gramophone. Or if they are a little more up-to-date they adjust their wireless telephone to the right wave-length and listen-in to the fruity contralto at Marconi House, singing \"The Gleaner's Slumber Song.\" And if they want literature, there is the Press. Nominally, it is true, the Press exists to impart information. But its real function is to provide, like the cinema, a distraction which shall occupy the mind without demanding of it the slightest effort or the fatigue of a single thought. This function, it must be admitted, it fulfils with an extraordinary success. It is possible to go on for years and years, reading two papers every working day and one on Sundays without ever once being called upon to think or to make any other effort than to move the eyes, not very attentively, down the printed column. Certain sections of the community still practise athletic sports in which individual participation is demanded. Great numbers of the middle and upper classes play golf and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently rich, shoot birds and pursue the fox and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass of the community has now come even to sport vicariously, preferring the watching of football to the fatigues and dangers of the actual game. All classes, it is true, still dance; but dance, all the world over, the same steps to the same tunes. The dance has been scrupulously sterilized of any local or personal individuality. These effortless pleasures, these ready-made distractions that are the same for every one over the face of the whole Western world, are surely a worse menace to our civilization than ever the Germans were. The working hours of the day are already, for the great majority of human beings, occupied in the performance of purely mechanical tasks in which no mental effort, no individuality, no initiative are required. And now, in the hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as mechanically stereotyped and demanding as little intelligence and initiative as does our work. Add such leisure to such work and the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed relief to come to the end of. Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization looks as though it might easily decline into a kind of premature senility. With a mind almost atrophied by lack of use, unable to entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested in the ready-made distractions offered from without that nothing but the grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence and crudity can move it, the democracy of the future will sicken of a chronic and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps, the way the Romans went: the Romans who came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing now, the capacity to distract themselves; the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made entertainments in which they had no participation. Their deadly ennui demanded ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking elephants, more rare and far-fetched animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand no less; but owing to the existence of a few idealists, doesn't get all it asks for. The most violent forms of entertainment can only be obtained illicitly. Let us not despair, however; we may still live to see blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome. The force of a boredom clamouring to be alleviated may yet prove too much for the idealists.

PSSD[1] is a thing, reports of long-term anhedonia and/or emotional numbness after quitting SSRIs are widespread. The parent poser never said anything about \"evil big pharama mind control\", however \"pharma companies trying to make money disregarding long-term health of patients\" is not a particularly narrow-minded view, anti-depressants are used to put people back to work disregarding their long-term health, and widespread over-prescription of SSRIs by physicians (not even psychiatrists), even to children, is a thing as well.

People now soak up ready-made distractions like movies, radio, and newspapers without thinking. - Huxley criticizes the sterility and sameness of modern distractions. The same movies and dances are consumed everywhere without local variation. - He sees the proliferation of effortless distractions as promoting boredom, atrophy of the mind, and decline of civilization. - The essay ends with a warning that the bored populace may eventually demand ever more violent entertainments, as happened in decadent Rome. Huxley fears we may \"live to see blood flowing across the stage.\" reply echtroipolemos 1 hour agoparent\"Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization looks as though it might easily decline into a kind of premature senility.\" This is the Cartesian distinction between understanding and imagination.

While there was an intellectual element it was imbued into the physical aspect of the work. Today, work is more intellectual. It makes complete sense that pleasures are not so much so. It's a great abstract discussion. Increases in technology have made it possible to use human intellect to move society forward, but also make pleasure that much easier to attain. I don't really have a point here but I find the topic very amusing to think about. I feel guilty watching hours of TV during the week to unwind. At the same time, it helps me to relax.

The victors failed to do this and the result was another war. Honestly, I'm not sure what they were thinking.

    "originBody": "Why you almost never see a clock at the mall Mark Dent Published: February 23, 2024 Retailers, casinos, and grocery stores use a trick called temporal distortion to make you forget about the real world. The week before Christmas last year, I went to a mall in my hometown. I wanted to buy a gift for my brother and browse through Barnes & Noble. Instead I purchased a smoothie from a vendor by the escalator and an overpriced cookie from the food court. I didn’t find any Christmas presents — I found a Korn T-shirt at Hot Topic that would’ve been a solid gag gift, but it was too large. Or did I see it at Spencer’s? The stores all blended together. When I returned to my car in the parking lot, after a journey through a walkway brightened by artificial lighting, I wasn’t sure if I’d been shopping for 30 minutes or an hour. I’d lost track of my surroundings and bought something I didn’t need. In other words, I was an ideal customer. This experience is shared by millions of shoppers every year — and it’s by design. Malls, department stores, grocery stores, and even casinos enlist tactics that cause “temporal distortion,” making us lose track of time and spend more money. A time-free fantasy zone When designing their layouts, malls took a cue from an industry that has perfected the art of separating people from their money: casinos. Bill Friedman probably knows more about casinos than anybody else on the planet. He’s a former gambling addict, the only person to manage two casinos on the Strip at the same time, the author of two seminal books about the casino industry, and a researcher who performed empirical studies on dozens of Nevada casinos and interviewed some of the earliest casino operators in the state. Friedman confirms an oft-cited detail about casinos: There are typically no clocks. Back when Nevada first legalized gambling, in 1931, the casinos did have clocks. Over the next few years, however, the owners heard complaints from the biggest gamblers: Remove the clocks, or they’d stop coming. The reason why? “[The gamblers] don’t want time,” Friedman told The Hustle. “They are in a fantasy and an escape world.” Roulette at Nevada’s New Meadows Club in 1931. (Bettmann/Getty Images) Friedman says he and other casino operators never unlocked an innovation that caused people to gamble more (not even free alcohol, he says). But they did what they could to eliminate distractions that interfered with the gamblers’ fantasy states. In the mid-1970s, for instance, when Friedman started managing Castaways and The Glass Slipper, he identified a major obstacle: natural light. One side of the Castaways casino was covered in glass. Every morning when the sun peeked over the buildings on the Strip, the slot machines and tables emptied. Some 85%-90% of customers left the gambling floor. “They realized it was daytime and they had a world they had to go back to,” Friedman says. Friedman bought a dark plastic covering for the glass. His security team raised it over the glass about five minutes before sunrise every morning, blocking out most of the light. The daylight exodus ceased. Under Friedman’s management, Castaways and The Glass Slipper became two of Vegas’ most profitable casinos in the 1970s and 1980s. He trained his staff not to interrupt gamblers who were in the zone — if somebody earned a comp, a staffer was to quickly tell them they’d like to buy them a free meal and let the customer claim it when their “fantasy” ended. “You don’t disrupt,” Friedman says. Castaways thrived in the 1970s and 1980s. It was imploded in 2006. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Friedman shared many of his techniques in his books and as a casino consultant. Some of his top design principles included: Intricate spacing: Low ceilings, maze-like designs, and intimate nooks for slot machines allow customers to slow down and feel a busy energy as they pass through a casino — yet still have room to carve out their own private domains by the machines. Mundane and medium sound levels: Sensual overload and environments in which sounds bounce off interior surfaces confuse customers. Most casinos use bland, low-volume music or ambient noise — researchers have found that songs provide gamblers a cue of how much time has passed, a big no-no. Monotonous design: Friedman believed that the machines and tables should be the focal point of any casino. Decor shouldn’t be so elaborate that it draws attention away from them. With the atmosphere just right, gamblers become engrossed in the game in front of them, causing their “field of consciousness to break down,” according to sociologist Gerda Reith. “In the arena of chance, as though under the sway of a magnetic field, the passage of time freezes into repetition, space contracts, and the value that accrues to money is obliterated,” she wrote in a thesis on gambling in western society. Raymond Lavoie, a New Mexico State University marketing professor, studied gamblers and flow, a state of mind where a person is so attentive to a task they lose track of everything else, including time. He found that gamblers who entered a flow state — caused by a distraction-free environment and a focus on a stimulating task — spent more time and money gambling than those who didn’t. They kept going because it felt good, so much so that despite losing more money overall they enjoyed the experience more. “You’re not thinking about the future,” Lavoie says, “you’re just enjoying this moment.” The longer you stay, the more you spend Casinos are unique in their aim. No other industry builds a world designed to maintain a customer’s fantasy so that they continue to partake in an activity that, in the long run, advantages the house. But retailers share at least one common goal with casinos: They want to keep people inside. “The goal of the retailer is to make sure that they find ways to increase the time we spend in the store, the number of items we see at the store, and end up buying not just what we came in for but ideally a few additional things,” says Vassilis Dalakas, a business professor at California State University San Marcos who has researched consumer psychology. Shoppers at London’s Westfield Shopping Centre. (Oli Scarff/Getty Images) Extra time in the store, in fact, can be nearly as dangerous to one’s wallet as extra time in the casino. When we shop, we have about 20 minutes before our brains lose the power to keep us from making questionable financial decisions, according to researchers from Bangor University in the United Kingdom. Using MRIs to gauge “the neural basis of decision making,” they found that after 23 minutes supermarket shoppers began using the emotional part of their brain rather than the cognitive part. That switch made it harder for people to consider costs and made them more susceptible to marketing bargains. After 40 minutes, their brains effectively shut down. They struggled to make any logical decisions. The Hustle But grocery stores face an uphill battle in persuading customers to stick around. Most people go to the grocery store knowing the items they want and trying to get out quickly. To keep shoppers around longer, grocers and other retail stores employ several tactics and design elements similar to the casino industry: Removing distractions: There are few clocks and windows, so customers won’t be reminded of the outside world. Boring designs draw attention to the products, especially at grocery stores and discount department stores. Building a maze: These layouts, most prominently deployed at Ikea, force customers to move through the store slowly and see as many products as possible. Retail stores also use sound and music to manipulate the environment. A study from the early 1980s showed that slow-tempo music led to shoppers moving more slowly through the store and spending more money than if fast-tempo music played. (There wasn’t a huge difference in results between slow-tempo music and no music at all.) “It’s almost mood maintenance,” says Theodore Noseworthy, a York University business professor who has studied the impacts of sound. “They’re trying to keep you in this positive state and almost in flow [so] that if you’re shopping, [you] just stay shopping.” The Hustle Whether it’s inside a department store or a casino, it’s now harder than ever to minimize distractions and foster a sense of lost time and place. Blame smartphones. A ping from a text or email can draw a person’s eyes to a screen, giving them an instant reminder of the time and something else they could be doing. “When you pull that thing out, it breaks you from that immersive environment,” Noseworthy says. The good news for retailers and casinos, though, is they may soon be able to use technology to create an environment more immersive than anything we’ve seen. No time in the future When I asked Lavoie, the academic who studies flow state, for another area ideal for creating flow besides casinos, he offered an immediate answer: virtual reality. People who don VR headsets don’t see or hear anything other than the virtual world in front of them. If VR takes off, retailers, marketers, and casino operators will use it to their advantage, building mesmerizing simulations for people to shop, buy, and gamble in. There would be no human distractions, such as friends or family members telling someone it’s time to stop gambling or shopping. And there would certainly be no clocks. “You don’t have to worry about any of that,” Lavoie says. “This is infinitely better than that. It narrows your attention fully.” It also sounds dystopian. But if learning about this worrisome consumer future makes you queasy, at least take comfort in knowing that it’s natural to lose track of time and space. As you get older, Noseworthy reminded me, it feels like time moves faster. In reality, it’s just that most of our days are mundane and monotonous, blending together and helping us lose track of time. Casinos and malls may be time warps. But so is life. Topics: Ecommerce And Retail Shopping Follow us on social media",

Could you provide a bit more context? reply Strilanc 12 hours agorootparent\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" was written before the replication crisis was found. I wouldn't call it \"debunked\", but some of the research it used didn't replicate. For example, see https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-pe... : > It is likely that Kahneman’s book, or at least some of his chapters, would be very different from the actual book, if it had been written just a few years later. However, in 2011 most psychologists believed that most published results in their journals can be trusted. [...] > Kahneman also started to wonder whether some of the results that he used in his book were real. A major concern was that implicit priming results might not be replicable. [...] Anyways, just google \"thinking fast and slow replication crisis\" to get a bunch of information about this topic. reply bsdpufferfish 11 hours agorootparentprevI don't have links handy but the gist of it is that regular people do not automatically interpret questions asked of them in a technical manner (carefully parsing AND and OR logically), but instead try to intuit the asker's intent based on context. So many of the studies concluded that the general population is unable to reason about trivial problems involving likelihood. However, when given more context about what's being asked, they absolutely can. reply selectodude 17 hours agorootparentprevI assure you behavioral economics has not run its course. reply bsdpufferfish 11 hours agorootparentThat's pretty broad.

I can see the clock from across the room. I have a clock in my bedroom, too. It has a cute rainbow light frame that serves as a nice little ambient night light.

I don't think they're all that uncommon. reply DonHopkins 14 hours agoprev>Retail stores also use sound and music to manipulate the environment. A study from the early 1980s showed that slow-tempo music led to shoppers moving more slowly through the store and spending more money than if fast-tempo music played. (There wasn’t a huge difference in results between slow-tempo music and no music at all.) >“It’s almost mood maintenance,” says Theodore Noseworthy, a York University business professor who has studied the impacts of sound. “They’re trying to keep you in this positive state and almost in flow [so] that if you’re shopping, [you] just stay shopping.” Dawn Of The Dead - Mall Music Collection / George A.

Finding the best quality for these tracks let alone their full versions wasn't easy. After a lot of research and editing, I give you the best I could put together. This cliché Muzak really makes the film what it is and captures a sense of slapstick comedy very much present in the movie.

But a decade+ later I wear them again, because the process of checking the current time on the wrist watches is one of the easiest[0] and less obstructive things. So if I need to track the time then I just need to have a vague idea of it in my mind and therefore I would just occasionally look it up and have at least some understanding of how much time I spent doing something. Well, most of the time. Doesn't work good in a bar, but still does work. And for the shops/mall and whatever - just write a goddamn list of the items beforehand! Be it a paper list[1] or an app in your mobile clock you always have on you, you would check out the items in no time and (if you are living not in the US) you would even know how much you would spend on it even before you enter the shop. [0] well, partially, because I wear black Axiom, heh [1] I recently bought a thin pocket sized notebook (not moleskin! soft cover) and an automatic pencil. Yes, a decade+ later. The most amusing situation was recently when I needed to do some explanations, the notebook (14\", an electronic one) was on the last breath, phone was on the charger quite far away and I just casually pull out that paper notebook and a pencil - my visavi just burst out laughing.

Not having clocks is one thing. Unlike a mall, the casino had zero natural light inside.

Is it just about clocks and hanging or not hanging them? Can the same effect occur without a clock involved? Does it describe something related to time perception and psychology, more general than Malls and their clocks? Is this Mall case just one specific example of that type of thing?

    "title": "Harnessing Console.log() for Visual Delights",
    "originLink": "https://frontendmasters.com/blog/console-delight/",
    "originBody": "console.delight January 11, 2024 Everyone knows you can use console.log() to log text and variables to the console. Did you know you could also render (limited) CSS, SVGs, and even HTML in it?!? I didn’t! It’s a neat technique that can delight the curious and further your brand for curious users. If you’re in a browser other than Safari, open up the DevTools console to see some examples of what we can create! How to use CSS, SVGs, and HTML in a console message Here’s the magic: %c. It lets us render a console message (like console.log or console.info) using a bit of CSS! Should I use console.log or console.info? Console logs are generally used for debugging purposes while console infos are used for information that is more relevant to end users. The only difference in terms of how they’re handled by browsers are some styling differences. For the purpose of an effect like the ones discussed in this article, I think console.info makes more sense. Let’s see how it works. Here’s the console.info from the online version of Adobe Photoshop (partially unminified): console.info( '%c %cAdobe %cPhotoshop Web%c %c2023.23.0.1%c %c037a8af9746', 'padding-left: 36px; line-height: 36px; background-image: url(\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhIAAgAPEBAAAAAP///wAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAgACAAAAKkhC+py3zfopxGvIsztsCGD4La2FVAGBoBuZnox45WcqLsum5KDWdvf1nwTo+fLbgDqo7LFCJJbOY0oidt6ozVKrtib0qaCnlYcJh7rf5iK6HZaM64VeS6L+pWf89WT+6vRAUBBVQ1gpOTJ4IYdxCnOBSJ8ZhkZNekk5ZSxpTpt6Y1eEVm00j3VALDmBXVyPEJB2r2ShoLh2ASqvU60dsr5yuBUQAAOw==\"); background-size: 32px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: 2px 2px', 'background: #666; border-radius:0.5em 0 0 0.5em; padding:0.2em 0em 0.1em 0.5em; color: white; font-weight: bold', 'background: #666; border-radius:0 0.5em 0.5em 0; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.1em 0em; color: white;', '', 'background: #c3a650; border-radius:0.5em; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.1em 0.5em; color: white;', '', 'background: #15889f; border-radius:0.5em; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.1em 0.5em; color: white;' ); Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Here’s what it looks like in Chrome and Edge (I use dark mode): You can probably already guess, the %cs correspond to the strings that follow. Each one starts a new element that has display: inline. The SVG is rendered as a data:image. Any data image works here! For example… Interestingly, a character (like the space I included to the right of the %c above) is required for the image to show up. Exploring the capabilities of non-text in the console SVG capabilities Note: It’s important that the SVG has xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" as an attribute! If it doesn’t, it won’t render, even in browsers that support SVGs as background images in the console. Capability Supported? Any “regular” SVG element (e.g. , , etc) ✅ Gradients ✅ Clip paths ✅ Masks ✅ Filters ✅ Transforms ✅1tag ❌ External images ❌ SMIL animation ✅ foreignObject ✅2 Patterns ✅ Relevant to SVG gradient, clip paths, masks, filters, and patterns I noticed that there’s a limit of one url() inside of SVGs used as background images in the console. That means that we cannot do something like this, applying separate gradients to different SVG elements, and have it work in the console:Code language: HTML, XML (xml) Using the same attribute via attributes directly on the SVG elements also does not work:Code language: HTML, XML (xml) However, if you’re able to apply the url() via CSS property, you can use the same gradient or other property. For example, this should work:rect { fill: url(#gradient1); }Code language: HTML, XML (xml) CSS capabilities Capability Supported? CSS animations ✅ :hover ❌ CSS variables ✅3 @media queries ✅4 Viewport units ✅5 background-image: linear-gradient() ✅ background-image: url() ❌ @import ❌ background-clip ❌ JavaScript capabilities Capability Supported? Console commands ❌ DOM references within the SVG ✅ DOM reference to the SVG itself ✅ DOM reference outside of the SVG ❌ .appendChild ❌ Changing the SVG’s DOM (attributes, text, etc.) ✅ setTimeout ❌6 requestAnimationFrame ❌6 WAAPI ❌ “Global” variables via multiple tags ✅ Setting CSS variables ✅ Importing external JS ❌ prompt ❌ .addEventListener ❌ Rendering HTML inside of the SVG You can also render HTML inside of the SVG that’s a background image inside of the console message 🤯. However, note that the HTML content has the same sort of restrictions that the SVG itself has, like notags, no event listeners, and such. Using HTML in the SVG might be particularly helpful if you’re wanting to include something like lists or use relative positioning. One other thing that this enables is 3D transforms! SVG content itself can’t have 3D transforms applied to it, but HTML inside of a foreignObject in the SVG can! Note that inside of the console the built-in depth sorting doesn’t seem to work in Chrome so I had to apply z-index to the appropriate sides to make this cube visualization work (another alternative would be to only use borders so you can’t tell the depth sorting is off): console.info( '%c ', `line-height:200px;padding-block:100px;padding-left:200px;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 200 200'%3E%3Cstyle%3E .wrapper %7B font-family: sans-serif; perspective: 500px; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 100%25; height: 100%25; %7D .cube %7B position: absolute; top: 20%25; left: 30%25; transform-style: preserve-3d; transform: rotateY(40deg) rotateX(-40deg); animation: wiggle_wiggle_wiggle_wiggle_wiggle_yeah 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate; %7D .side %7B width: 8rem; height: 8rem; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); display: inline-block; position: absolute; line-height: 8rem; color: %23fff; text-align: center; box-sizing: border-box; border: 3px solid %23f00; font-size: 4rem; %7D .front %7B transform: translateZ(4rem); z-index: 1; %7D .back %7B transform: rotateY(180deg) translateZ(4rem); %7D .left %7B transform: rotateY(-90deg) translateZ(4rem); z-index: 1; %7D .right %7B transform: rotateY(90deg) translateZ(4rem); %7D .top %7B transform: rotateX(90deg) translateZ(4rem); %7D .bottom %7B transform: rotateX(-90deg) translateZ(4rem); %7D @keyframes wiggle_wiggle_wiggle_wiggle_wiggle_yeah %7B 0%25 %7B transform: rotateY(15deg) rotateX(-15deg); %7D 100%25 %7B transform: rotateY(60deg) rotateX(-45deg); %7D %7D %3C/style%3E%3CforeignObject width='100%25' height='100%25'%3E%3Cdiv xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' class='wrapper'%3E%3Cdiv class='cube'%3E%3Cdiv class='side front'%3E1%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv class='side back'%3E6%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv class='side left'%3E3%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv class='side right'%3E4%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv class='side top'%3E2%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv class='side bottom'%3E5%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3C/foreignObject%3E%3C/svg%3E\")` );Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Example effects to inspire you So, what are some things that we can make given these capabilities and limitations?

The one below is pulled from Amelia Carlie’s pen but you could do more decorative elements, draw outlines of shapes, or create an ongoing visualization if you’d like. console.info( '%c ', `padding-left:840.42px;padding-top:80.75px;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg class='container' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 840.42 80.75'%3E%3Cstyle%3E .container %7B background: linear-gradient(to left, %23112, %23223); %7D @keyframes draw %7B 40%25, 80%25 %7B opacity: 1; stroke-dashoffset: 0; stroke: %23ec0062; %7D 95%25, 100%25 %7B stroke-dashoffset: 0; opacity: 0; %7D %7D .line %7B fill: none; stroke: %23334; stroke-width: 4.75; stroke-linecap: round; stroke-miterlimit: 10; stroke-dasharray: 200; animation: draw 7s infinite ease-in-out; %7D .line-reverse %7B stroke-dashoffset: -200; %7D .line-forwards %7B stroke-dashoffset: 200; %7D %3C/style%3E%3C!-- A --%3E%3Cpolyline class='line line-forwards' points='2.38,77.83 33.4,6.55 64.42,77.83'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='17.96' y1='42.19' x2='38.47' y2='42.19'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- M --%3E%3Cpolyline class='line line-forwards' points='81.87,78.01 81.87,6.37 113.21,42.55 143.91,6.37'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3Cpath class='line line-forwards' d='M113.21,42.55'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cpath class='line line-forwards' d='M113.21,42.55'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='143.91' y1='16.66' x2='143.91' y2='78.01'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- E --%3E%3Cpolyline class='line line-forwards' points='223,6.73 160.96,6.73 160.96,78.01 222.95,78.01'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='171.25' y1='42.37' x2='213.59' y2='42.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- L --%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='240.14' y1='6.73' x2='240.14' y2='78.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3Cpath class='line line-forwards' d='M240.14,6.73'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='250.43' y1='78.37' x2='302.18' y2='78.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- I --%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='319.21' y1='6.73' x2='319.21' y2='78.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- Reverse A --%3E%3Cpolyline class='line line-reverse' points='398.4,77.83 367.38,6.55 336.36,77.83'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3Cline class='line line-reverse' x1='382.81' y1='42.19' x2='362.31' y2='42.19'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- C --%3E%3Cpath class='line line-reverse' d='M504.32,78.37h-9.41H478.1c-19.78,0-35.82-16.04-35.82-35.82c0-19.78,16.04-35.82,35.82-35.82h26.22'%3E%3C/path%3E%3C!-- A --%3E%3Cpolyline class='line line-forwards' points='521.62,77.83 552.64,6.55 583.66,77.83'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='537.21' y1='42.19' x2='557.71' y2='42.19'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- R --%3E%3Cpath class='line line-reverse' d='M610.94,42.19h19.4c9.89,0,17.91-8.02,17.91-17.91s-8.02-17.91-17.91-17.91h-29.65v71.64'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='630.34' y1='42.19' x2='662.73' y2='78.01'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- L --%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='679.89' y1='6.73' x2='679.89' y2='78.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='690.18' y1='78.37' x2='741.93' y2='78.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- I --%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='758.96' y1='6.73' x2='758.96' y2='78.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C!-- E --%3E%3Cpolyline class='line line-forwards' points='838.04,6.73 776,6.73 776,78.01 837.99,78.01'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3Cline class='line line-forwards' x1='786.29' y1='42.37' x2='828.63' y2='42.37'%3E%3C/line%3E%3C/svg%3E\")` );Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Heck, you can even create basic particle effects!

animation? This one is from Cyril Levallois (doesn’t work in Firefox due to the character limit): This one is enormous! Here’s an example to show that you can use JavaScript to switch out the text of the SVG (using .textContent, not .innerText since it’s an SVG element). With that being said, you can’t do something like a scramble text effect due to the limitation around using setInterval and requestAnimationFrame6. console.info( '%c ', `line-height:100px;padding-block:50px;padding-left:400px;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 400 100'%3E%3Cstyle%3E text %7B font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 100; fill: %23d8eaff; %7D %3C/style%3E%3Crect width='400' height='100'%3E%3C/rect%3E%3Ctext text-anchor='middle' font-size='15' x='200' y='50'%3ESaturday, December 16, 2023 at 6:28 PM%3C/text%3E%3Cscript%3E const text_element = document.querySelector('text'); text_element.textContent = new Date().toLocaleString(true, %7B weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric', hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric' %7D); %3C/script%3E%3C/svg%3E\")` );Code language: JavaScript (javascript) However, we can swap out the text (or any elements) after the start if we use an SVG along with CSS animations! To do so you have to include the content in the original SVG and use CSS keyframes. console.info( '%c ', `line-height:100px;padding-block:50px;padding-left:400px;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 400 100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cstyle%3E @keyframes swapText %7B 0%25, 49.999%25 %7B opacity: 0; %7D 50%25, 100%25 %7B opacity: 1; %7D %7D text %7B animation: swapText 2s linear infinite; %7D text:nth-child(2) %7B animation-delay: 1s; %7D @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) %7B text %7B fill: white; %7D %7D %3C/style%3E%3Ctext text-anchor='middle' font-size='15' x='200' y='50'%3E Hello %3C/text%3E%3Ctext text-anchor='middle' font-size='15' x='200' y='50'%3E there %3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\")` );Code language: JavaScript (javascript) The above technique can be used to create a stop motion effect or make words and/or elements appear “randomly” around the console (you might want to use JavaScript or a pre-processor to help you generate this sort of thing). For example, here’s a some random circles that disappear and appear: console.info( '%c ', `line-height:400px;padding-block:200px;padding-left:400px;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 400 400' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cstyle%3E%0Acircle %7B animation: swapText 20s linear infinite;%0A%7D @keyframes swapText %7B 0%25, 3.3333333333%25 %7B opacity: 1; %7D 3.33333333330001%25, 100%25 %7B opacity: 0; %7D%0A%7D %3C/style%3E%3Ccircle cx='188.14' cy='207.93' r='186.27' fill='rgb(115.4, 46.31, 186.22)' style='animation-delay: 0s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='208.55' cy='300.58' r='81.02' fill='rgb(60.85, 183.01, 62.49)' style='animation-delay: -0.666667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='235.74' cy='369.64' r='93.29' fill='rgb(10.65, 167.53, 177.52)' style='animation-delay: -1.33333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='125.52' cy='188.99' r='172.44' fill='rgb(232.94, 75.08, 191.74)' style='animation-delay: -2s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='354.54' cy='196.67' r='195.4' fill='rgb(137.93, 57.6, 128.53)' style='animation-delay: -2.66667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='90.95' cy='96.81' r='174.46' fill='rgb(106.74, 31.22, 195)' style='animation-delay: -3.33333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='309.85' cy='12.27' r='18.34' fill='rgb(189.97, 49.11, 49.68)' style='animation-delay: -4s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='263.33' cy='392.19' r='58.1' fill='rgb(72.32, 215.33, 61.88)' style='animation-delay: -4.66667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='335.22' cy='97.45' r='127.62' fill='rgb(249.17, 162.85, 49.06)' style='animation-delay: -5.33333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='293.03' cy='82.52' r='129.85' fill='rgb(159.97, 1.79, 70.68)' style='animation-delay: -6s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='332.17' cy='399.66' r='45.81' fill='rgb(125.03, 23.01, 116.03)' style='animation-delay: -6.66667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='244.8' cy='218.9' r='16.62' fill='rgb(106.53, 210.25, 160.91)' style='animation-delay: -7.33333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='161.25' cy='72.33' r='77.1' fill='rgb(42.7, 63.89, 62.5)' style='animation-delay: -8s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='120.48' cy='211.7' r='96.26' fill='rgb(45.85, 88.66, 125.79)' style='animation-delay: -8.66667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='79.6' cy='195.93' r='181.76' fill='rgb(186.39, 73.52, 213.41)' style='animation-delay: -9.33333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='26.78' cy='133.29' r='169.22' fill='rgb(132.18, 143.88, 243.06)' style='animation-delay: -10s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='250.25' cy='16.06' r='157.62' fill='rgb(181.3, 222.83, 41.63)' style='animation-delay: -10.6667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='217.1' cy='230.67' r='176.79' fill='rgb(25.67, 124.93, 206.89)' style='animation-delay: -11.3333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='76.33' cy='192.31' r='95.13' fill='rgb(249.72, 59.98, 233.37)' style='animation-delay: -12s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='51.43' cy='146.38' r='45.94' fill='rgb(178.89, 28.13, 79.03)' style='animation-delay: -12.6667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='119.16' cy='280.71' r='57.92' fill='rgb(218.66, 139.32, 192.7)' style='animation-delay: -13.3333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='315.62' cy='272.65' r='133.31' fill='rgb(200.25, 161.12, 172.04)' style='animation-delay: -14s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='23.75' cy='20.3' r='93.59' fill='rgb(133.26, 3.74, 246.73)' style='animation-delay: -14.6667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='202.55' cy='251.22' r='181.33' fill='rgb(238.6, 80.06, 100.32)' style='animation-delay: -15.3333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='279.03' cy='129.2' r='109.52' fill='rgb(92.32, 128.44, 80.39)' style='animation-delay: -16s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='170.57' cy='65.82' r='149.48' fill='rgb(31.27, 122.5, 20.26)' style='animation-delay: -16.6667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='166.27' cy='188.27' r='113.96' fill='rgb(208.93, 241.97, 247.86)' style='animation-delay: -17.3333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='320.95' cy='308.88' r='17.71' fill='rgb(131.17, 189.11, 212.93)' style='animation-delay: -18s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='42.53' cy='61.09' r='86.35' fill='rgb(3.28, 56.87, 58.35)' style='animation-delay: -18.6667s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3Ccircle cx='29.74' cy='333.41' r='128.8' fill='rgb(39.54, 206.65, 222.78)' style='animation-delay: -19.3333s;'%3E%3C/circle%3E%3C/svg%3E\")` );Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Including a link inside of the design It’s impossible to add click events or links inside of the SVG that’s used as a background image. However, if you’re fine showing the full URL, you can fake it by using carefully chosen padding values to place the URL from the console message where you want it to be relative to the background image. It might also be worth changing the font-family being used to more closely match the SVG that you use. Keep in mind that the URL itself will affect the width of the element, so you may need to adjust your SVG. Also, make sure to test thoroughly between browsers because there are more cross-browser inconsistencies with this technique. console.info( '%chttps://zachsaucier.com/',

only shows the link and not the background image. Responsive sizing Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to make the message span 100% of the width of the console. I believe that this is because we can’t change the display of elements in the console, so things like width: 100% don’t work here. The element must have an explicit width and height in pixels (or other non-relative unit), or else its size will be based on the text. I did notice that console.table(['foo']) spans the whole width, but we’re unable to use CSS styling on console tables as far as I know. In the future, I hope browsers will add a responsive width element in the console. Detecting whether or not the console is open Reveal animations (like the first half of the line-drawing animation above) are one way of animating using this technique. However, these animations may finish before someone actually opens up the console. As such, I wanted to see if we can detect when the console is open so that we can wait to fire the animation until then. To my knowledge, there’s no way to detect if the console itself is open (if you know of a way, please let me know!). However, there are some ways to detect if the DevTools in general are open, though the method seems to change every so often. I got the lightweight package devtools-detect working in a project using this sort of setup. However, the package has many known issues, which the author notes in the README. But for the purpose of something superfluous like this it is probably okay. If you’re really wanting to do this, I might recommend detect-devtools-via-debugger-heartstop instead because it seems more reliable but I didn’t test it myself. With that being said, you may want to use a looping or ambient (constantly running) animation so you make sure that your user sees the hard work you’ve invested. Performance impact I tried getting a sense of the performance impact by running the most intense animation that I provided as an example, the horse animation from the example section above, and looking at my Activity Monitor. When the console was open and the animation was running, the “Google Chrome Helper (GPU)” went up to around 80% on my 2018 Macbook Pro. With any other devtools tab open instead or with the dev tools closed, I could not see any measurable impact on any process. This indicates that this sort of effect should not have much of an impact on your page unless someone has their devtools console open. With that being said, always do your own testing, including on a wider range of devices, to make sure it’s not a detriment to any user’s experience. Browser support Note: Using consoles in this way is very experimental and these results are likely to be inaccurate at some point in the future. As far as I can tell, styles in the console using %c like this is mentioned in a spec but not fleshed out. Here’s what Adobe’s console.info command looks like in various browsers: Chrome & Edge This is what you saw earlier in the article, reposted here again: Firefox Firefox fails to set the proper height of the background image and cuts off the SVG a bit: I got it to appear the same using some guess and check: console.info( '%c %cAdobe %cPhotoshop Web%c %c2023.23.0.1%c %c037a8af9746', \"vertical-align: middle; padding-left:36px; padding-top: 11px; padding-bottom: 9px; line-height: 36px; background-image: url('data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhIAAgAPEBAAAAAP///wAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAgACAAAAKkhC+py3zfopxGvIsztsCGD4La2FVAGBoBuZnox45WcqLsum5KDWdvf1nwTo+fLbgDqo7LFCJJbOY0oidt6ozVKrtib0qaCnlYcJh7rf5iK6HZaM64VeS6L+pWf89WT+6vRAUBBVQ1gpOTJ4IYdxCnOBSJ8ZhkZNekk5ZSxpTpt6Y1eEVm00j3VALDmBXVyPEJB2r2ShoLh2ASqvU60dsr5yuBUQAAOw=='); background-size: 32px 32px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: 0px 0px; overflow: visible\", 'vertical-align: middle; background: #666; border-radius:0.5em 0 0 0.5em; padding:0.2em 0em 0.1em 0.5em; color: white; font-weight: bold', 'vertical-align: middle; background: #666; border-radius:0 0.5em 0.5em 0; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.1em 0em; color: white;', '', 'vertical-align: middle; background: #c3a650; border-radius:0.5em; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.1em 0.5em; color: white;', '', 'vertical-align: middle; background: #15889f; border-radius:0.5em; padding:0.2em 0.5em 0.1em 0.5em; color: white;' ); Code language: JavaScript (javascript) However, this throws off the position of the SVG in Chrome and Edge: It seems like for Firefox you have to basically double the height: use the height for the line-height then use half the height for the padding-block. The downside of doing this is that it adds a bit of extra white space at the bottom of the SVGs in Chrome and Edge. In order to have this effect look significantly better in Firefox, I think this is worth the tradeoff but I also hope that Firefox can address this issue. If you have figured out a way to get around this issue, please let me know! Additionally, Firefox has a significantly shorter character limit for console messages, so ones like the horse animation above don’t render anything in Firefox. So long as you’re not trying to align other text with an SVG, you can drop the vertical-align: middle which makes the Chrome & Edge version a bit better. Safari Safari is the only major browser that doesn’t support this sort of thing (per usual). It just prints the raw text and ignores the CSS: It does have some limited CSS support for console messages though, just not enough for the more complex CSS and background images. Hopefully this article can encourage them to improve their support! All in all, since this technique acts like progressive enhancement and is basically an easter egg, I would be happy to ship something like this in production code at any company. I think you should too! Tooling that makes this easier My console testing CodePen: I made a CodePen that automatically generates these console.infos for you! Paste an SVG into the HTML section of the pen, run it, then open the console. The console will show you how the message renders as well as the code used to generate it. Your favorite vector editor – Using the CodePen above, you can paste in almost any SVG and get a working console command. That means you can use Inkscape, Adobe Illustator, or whatever other tool you want to use to generate the SVG! css-doodle is a tool / web-component which is prime for creating SVGs to use in the console, detailed in the section below. SVGOMG – Trim down your SVG to reduce the file size. This can also help you try to fit in Firefox’s character limit. EZGIF for converting regular images into data URIs. Notable mention: css-doodle css-doodle is a library similar to P5.js and the like. It specializes in HTML + CSS + SVG creations (though recently it’s gotten support for GLSL shaders). This makes it a perfect for creating effects for the console! It’s created by Chuan (@yuanchuan). Note that it’s still fairly early on in its development and not everything about it is documented! I could write several articles on css-doodle, but for the purpose of this article I will keep it short: You can use the css-doodle web editor to see examples and edit them to create your own (there’s also a starter CodePen if you’d like to work or save your work there). For what commands you can use, the usage section of the website is helpful. It is pretty important to use the @svg command so that it uses SVG, which can then be used as a background image in console commands, though some other commands do work outside of the SVG ones. You can set ease for SVG animations in keySpines. The CodePen collection is another great place to see examples and learn more by breaking down how effects are made. When you’re happy with your result, the easiest way to copy the raw SVG is to use the element inspector of your dev tools: right click theand click Copy then Copy outerHTML. If your SVG element is empty, that means you didn’t use the @svg command to create your work. Here’s an example, based on this demo: console.info( '%c ', `line-height:100px;padding-block:50px;padding-left:100px;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='-50 -50 100 100' stroke='%231B2D37' fill='none'%3E%3Crect stroke-width='2' width='98' height='98' x='-49' y='-49' fill='%23d5f1ff'%3E%3C/rect%3E%3Cpolyline stroke-dasharray='10' pathLength='10' points='0.00001 0,-0.991793 -1.8173446,-2.2402741 3.4823486,6.1949453 0.4474444,-3.4331809 -7.5362848,-6.2133014 8.2797801,12.2932314 1.7851273,-5.0423611 -13.5870507,-10.8698086 12.4970611,18.1990361 3.9991341,-5.7863618 -19.8785691,-16.1450444 16.0621084,23.818206 7.0663947,-5.6410665 -26.3168978,-21.9675334 18.9092802,29.059075 10.9548628,-4.591445 -32.806032,-28.2596767 20.9799619,33.8332657 15.6237668,-2.6317133 -39.248728,-34.9384013 22.223098,38.056466 21.0239282,0.2345778 -45.5473393,-41.915853 22.5956673,41.6491767 27.0981467,3.9945268 -51.6046566,-49.1001299 22.0630962,44.5374235 33.7816489,8.6259382 -57.3247487,-56.3960484 20.5996079,46.653429 41.0025973,14.0974514 -62.6137955,-63.7059392 18.188505,47.9362389 48.6826567,20.368742 -67.3809088,-70.9304643 14.8223821,48.3322984 56.7376131,27.3907928 -71.5389343,-77.9694531 10.5032683,47.7959744 65.0780416,35.1062339 -75.0052279,-84.7227478 5.2426967,46.2900186 73.6100184,43.4497494 -77.7024033,-91.0910542 -0.9382987,43.7859697 82.2358716,52.3485481 -79.559042,-96.9767918 -8.0092596,40.2644891 90.8549658,61.7228942 -80.5103629,-102.2849352 -15.9304529,35.7156303 99.3645155,71.4866962 -80.4988455,-106.9238436 -24.6530929,30.1390368 107.66042,81.5481482 -79.474802,-110.8060694 -34.1196343,23.5440691 115.6381161,91.8104205 -77.396894,-113.8491417 -44.264135,15.9498573 123.1934404'%3E%3Canimate attributeName='stroke-dashoffset' from='10' to='0' dur='10s'%3E%3C/animate%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E\")` );Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Notable mention: CSS text effects You can create some nice-looking console messages without using SVGs or anything like that.

For example, the fairly well-known Reddit console.log art / ad: console.log( `%c ,d\"=≥,.,qOp, ,7' ''²$( ) ,7' '?q$7' ..,$$,. ,. .,,--***²\"\"²***--,,. ., ² ,p²'' ''²q, ² : ,7' '7, : ' $ ,db, ,db, $ ' '$ ²$$² ²$$² $' Using Reddit at work?

If you’re looking for some tools to generate ASCII art, ASCII Art Archive has a bunch of tools to generate ASCII art, including image to ASCII and text to ASCII. Notable mention: Emojis Emojis work well in the console. Sometimes, that may be all you need! Go forth and delight! I’m hoping that this article inspires developers and companies to implement delightful console surprises. I think it should become a normal addition to a website! Note that 3D transforms don’t apply to SVGs in any context, including the as a background image in the console. ↩︎ foreignObject works!! But only if xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" is set on the outermost element. There are also restrictions, which is further discussed in the examples section. ↩︎ Note that CSS variable usage cannot be inherited from the scope outside of the SVG (i.e. from your webpage). ↩︎ @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) is particularly useful if you don’t want to set a background color but want text to be readable since the console’s background color depends on the user’s setting. ↩︎ Viewport units for elements inside of the SVG. I was surprised to! They seem to use the SVG’s size as the viewport upon initial inspection. ↩︎ Note that setTimeout and requestAnimationFrame can only run before the console message is posted and not afterwards. ↩︎",

Of course you may argue it was users' fault who should have vetted every single line of their dependency, but let's be real. Unfortunately there are a lot of unprofessional people in open source, and while I hate to stereotype, they are especially prevalent in the JavaScript community where it's typical to have hundreds to thousands of unknown dependencies in every project.

    "originBody": "Home Downloads Sections Android Linux MacOS Networking Windows Youtube Microsoft Is Driving Users AwayFeb 17, 2023| Windows What will be the end of Windows? Microsoft. I’ve been a lifelong Windows user since the 90s and even MS-DOS back in the 80s, but things are changing. I’ve been using other operating systems more and more. MacOS and Linux are getting mixed into my workflow more and Windows less. Why? Microsoft is actively angering it power users by removing features. By trying to simplify Windows they are actively making administering it worse. The Problem Microsoft is in a panic from the continued loss of it’s user base. They are making some improvements like the GUI and cleaning up other elements that give a more cohesive look. No more mixing Metro UI and Legacy panels like Windows 10. While this is good on the surface, they aren’t fixing anything. In fact, things are about to get much worse with the removal of these panels. On Tuesday, I had a printer issue at a client site and I was going to pull up the “Devices and Printers” panel to manage the drives and printing default settings. In the most recent 22H2 Windows 11 update, they hid it! Using old Control Panel (Start->Run->control) Clicking on this will redirect you to the new settings printer that gives NO options to do any advanced troubleshooting and removes the ability to FIX the issue! What about the old control printers shortcut? remapped to the new crap. The Solution With any Windows problem, Microsoft never really removes ANYTHING! Remember, this company is still using legacy code from the 90s in spots and just slapping in new coat of paint on top of it every 5 years when they need to extract more money from its users. To Access the old devices and printer use the run prompt and type the following: shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A} Alternatively, you can create a new shortcut and assign the key combination to it. Create a new shortcut on your desktop Set the location to: explorer.exe shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A} Set the name to Devices and Printers Choose the shortcut icon Add the key combination shortcut (CTRL + ALT + D is default for this window) This provides you an easy to access link as well as overwriting the keyboard shortcut to open the old version. Success for now… The Future MacOS and Linux will keep gaining market share. Microsoft needs to stop actively sabotaging it’s users. MacOS is bland and hasn’t changed in years, while Linux has a technical barrier of entry with little support. Yet, both of these options are better than modern Windows unless you need Gaming. However, Steam with it’s steamdeck might be changing the game… Walkthrough Video #Microsoft See Also Is Windows Bad Table of Contents The Problem The Solution The Future Walkthrough Video Privacy Terms & Conditions",

    "commentBody": "Microsoft is driving users away (christitus.com)171 points by leotravis10 13 hours agohidepastfavorite285 comments masfoobar 2 minutes agoMicrosoft has been driving me away since the Windows XP days. Before that (and being young and not exposed to anything else) viewed Microsoft's OS as the best thing since slice bread. I was able to code and do things with Visual Studio 5.0/6.0. In my eyes nothing could compare. One day, my mouse pointer would slowly move down the screen without touching it. Thinking it was a virus or something, did a reinstall of XP. A few months later, the pointer was playing up, again. There were other things but it was the start to my journey to GNU/Linux. I was barely exposed to GNU/Linux a year or two before but due to lack of internet at that time, could not grasp the change being a Windows user. This time I purchased a book on Ubuntu and realised how cool this really is. It also made me appreciate programming. I no longer was 'clicking the play button' on Visual Studio. Now I was understanding how to compile with gcc. Since then I would choose GNU/Linux over Windows most days of the week. The only exception is my job. For example, I have one job that still uses legacy software. We are talking programs originally written in the late 90s in Visual Basic 6. I have to use Windows. Some program before I joined moved over to .NET and SQL Server. My goal is to move away from Microsofts tools. No more Windows Servers. Using (perhaps) Go, Postgres, etc. The Company would save a lot more money as well. Baby Steps. I don't hate Windows, but I still have to install it on one laptop and the amount of stuff I don't want gets annoying! Most of the time I am using Debian, both on my (other) laptop and as a Server machine. I could say more but that will do. reply zeroCalories 12 hours agoprevIt's amazing to me that Microsoft messed up Windows. All they had to do was not not change things, but they continued to force junk on me that I don't need, take power away from me, and spy on me. Honestly MacOS isn't much better. Linux is still crap software, but we've reached the point where most things can be done on Linux, so good riddance. I hope that more people switch and Linux continues to improve. There's actually interesting improvements being made in the Linux world too, like NixOS. reply Animats 12 hours agoparent> It's amazing to me that Microsoft messed up Windows. It is. At Windows 7, they pretty much had desktops right. Everything mostly worked. They'd finally fixed the crashing problems. (How? The Static Driver Verifier validated that third-party kernel drivers would not crash the rest of the system, and a classifier applied to crash dumps routed similar crash dumps to the same maintainer.) The UI was reasonable for a desktop, and wasn't a clone of the mobile UI. No ads. Didn't phone home too much, and you could turn off auto-update. No issues with installing your own software. Then Microsoft tried to make desktop look like mobile and tablet. Desktop began to look like a big phone, optimized for content consumption and fat finger selection. The result was something that was neither a good desktop nor a good content consumption device. reply quantified 11 hours agorootparentWhen you have things about as good as they'll reasonably get, having a group as large as that dev organization going full throttle is more likely to make things worse.

While I wouldn't want to go back to 8 due to subsequent quality of life improvements for developers like WSL and winget, I still miss the UI every day. It looked clean and simple and worked great with a touchscreen and keyboard alike. Trying to navigate a Surface on Windows 11 with the utterly useless widgets hijacking the left swipe, the microscopic start menu, the on screen keyboard which can no longer be undocked and resized and the now-missing notification toggles is an exercise in frustration. The backlash against Windows 8 from purists who hated anything mobile is exactly what led to the current enshittified version of the Windows user interface imo. Microsoft overcorrected and have now ended up in a worse place than they were when they started. reply whiplash451 12 hours agorootparentprev> you could turn off auto-update I would not mess with that bit these days reply pierat 10 hours agorootparentThere is a difference between: 1. Updates have been applied (in the middle of your crucial thing). Reboot in 60 seconds. Fuck you if you think you can cancel haha. 2. Updates for the following packages are available.

I've been using Linux for work for years and tried to switch from Windows to Linux for games. NVIDIA drivers and game support on Linux is not an experience I'd recommend to anyone without experience. On laptop it's awesome, unless you have both an iGPU and dedicated GPU, then switching properly is a pain. WiFi drivers are a hit or miss: some cards are great, some others are not well supported. Knowing which is which before buying requires reading extensive documentation. Even Dell on their XPS 9310 fucked up Linux support so bad they dediced to quietly remove the option to buy Ubuntu laptop and communication about supporting Linux. My personal laptop recovers all screen when waking up from sleep, my work laptop doesn't and I need to unplug and plug them again. One thing that works awesomely well for me is Printer supports (scanners are another pair of hands though). Anywhere I tried, discovery works great out of the box, even for USB printers it works without having to download a driver from a strange website.

However, recently Windows started to take more than 15 minutes for booting (except for sometimes, when it takes only 3 seconds as if to mock me), and none of the 30 suggestions or so I've tried could fix this big. Since the advice in such cases is always to re-install everything (nevermind 100+ audio plugins with proprietary DRM I'd need to re-install), I'm thinking more than twice before booting into Windows these days. I don't have much time for gaming anyway, and will probably just give up my audio plugins at some point. reply tux1968 10 hours agorootparentprevI think most people eventually figure out hardware that works fine under Linux.

It's not like they're going to switch to Linux; if they were really going to do that, they would have done it already in the last 20 years. Microsoft has gotten smart, and realized that all those people swearing \"if they do this, I'm finally switching to Linux!\" weren't really serious, because they've been saying exactly that for a couple of decades now, and still haven't, so almost nothing they do at this point will actually get them to leave Windows as long as it actually lets them do their work, however poorly and annoyingly. reply hakfoo 6 hours agorootparentprevThey may not consciously confirm it, but I suspect someone figured out \"learned helplessness is good for business.\" New users can be steered through every dark-pattern install process, and upsold into every service since they don't have existing preferences.

I started using Linux (Gentoo) as student 20 years ago to learn LKMs programming, and with my main Desktop being Windows currently, I give a new try to linux distros every year. I see Linux distros improve year after year, but they are still light years away from providing a good user experience. And even if I don't agree with many Windows 11 updates (like the cumulating number of services required to run user interfaces, the taskbar which can't be moved anymore, the bloatware by default and so on...), Windows still provides a better & smoother user experience overall. Even Desktop multitasking experience feels better engineered in Windows, probably because of a better Desktop processes timing. reply MattPalmer1086 10 hours agorootparentIt's interesting hearing such diametrically opposed experiences. I've been using Linux as my main desktop for over 20 years. I find Windows to be an unholy confusing mess these days. Want to set the microphone sound level; go to sound settings - nope, not there. Probably in some other legacy control panel I guess. By contrast, most things I need to configure in Linux are in a single place. File copying is much faster than Windows. Updates don't prevent me from working and require multiple reboots. It crashes less often. Anyway, a lot is probably just what you're used to. I'm sure I excuse many Linux failings because it doesn't bother me and I know how to work around it. reply earlone 10 hours agorootparentI understand your perspective and appreciate the flexibility of Linux, however achieving my desired setup on Linux does involve more effort and is sometimes impossible, as I explain in my post below. reply slooonz 11 hours agorootparentprev> they are still light years away from providing a good user experience I really don’t get this.

But they don't feel the same. When we talk about UI/UX we talk about look and feel. I've installed Ubuntu & MX Linux to reply to your question, here are random issues I get with the default setup: why do I get no sound when I play a youtube video (it works on one distro, broken on the other one) ? why do I have no option to change the refresh rate of my monitor to more than 60Hz ? Therefore where is the 120hz smooth scrolling ? Why is my keyboard layout set to english by default while I am located in Europe ? How am I supposed to configure my WIFI password if my keyboard layout is incorrect by default ? Why does my CPU fan runs at full speed while I am just writing this text currently with no other user task in background ? If I use a laptop with a second keyboard (bluetooth), why aren't my keystrokes taken into account when the system asks me to confirm the reboot by pressing \"enter\" (I need to reach the laptop keyboard since the bluetooth one is not taken into account) ? Why does my browser need to reload its cache & configuration from my drive each time I boot my computer; why isn't it loaded in RAM by default ? Why do I still have the first mouse wheel scrolling event ignored in the Chrome/Chromium web browsers in most distros I try, while this bug has been driving users nuts for years while the solution is already known ? I use a dual monitor setup, why does the system displays some glitches at first boot ? Why doesn't it doesn't remember my primary screen when I log off the session, and shows the login prompt on the other screen ? Why does the system hangs when I run a game like counter strike 2 and I try to switch back to the desktop ? Why does the system get super slow while it tries to recompile shaders, making it impossible to open a web browser ? and I'm not even mentioning the issues installing/uninstalling proprietary video drivers which is still a huge mess.

Either give in to iCloud keychain or use a different secrets manager. If you're using a Mac with a T1 or T2 security coprocessor or Apple Silicon, your local keychain can only be decrypted with a key stored in those chips. Your backups are useless. I figured this out the hard way when an Apple depot repair for a failed display flex somehow ended up with my logic board getting replaced as well.

A typical example would be the printing dialog used by various apps. It used to work all right from the mouse. Now you can't tell which widget has focus, and can't tell how to activate a given UI element from the keyboard. Worse yet, you selected your print job parameters, press Enter, and nothing happens. You have to click the OK button with the mouse. And don't get me started on the ribbon UI which was inflicted upon the world in Office 2007 onwards and then shoved upon everyone's throats in subsequent editions of Windows. Why did they have to change such things? It worked as it was. There's no improvement and, on the contrary, a quite noticeable involution. reply nickelpro 12 hours agoprevThis is basically an article by a guy angry that the UI for printers changed and predicting the end of the Windows empire based on that. reply naasking 12 hours agoparentHe's not angry that it changed, he's angry that the new settings interface doesn't let him fix the issue at all, and while he used to be able to easily access the old interface so he could fix it the old way, MS has now hidden that ability too. If not for some user-hostile magical incantation, printing would have been permanently broken. Who wouldn't be seriously annoyed with this situation? How many non-technical users would have chucked a perfectly good printer because of a poorly executed software change? The Windows control panel UI transition has been a serious boondoggle from the start. reply nickelpro 12 hours agorootparentThe article doesn't specify what the issue was, neither you or I can say what the best way to fix the problem would be, if it required something specific of the old panel unable to be accessed via more appropriate or modern tooling. I suspect this is on purpose. reply magicalhippo 12 hours agorootparentWell I still need to access the good old control panel each time I long on to a new machine, since the new settings app thing still doesn't have all the regional settings.

(I use plural because they've been trying to replace the actual good control panel basically every version of Windows since 7 and it's an incredible mess). Enterprise users put up with Windows because it's better to administrate than anything else, so taking away that stuff really is murdering windows. reply makeitdouble 11 hours agorootparentTBF I don't think there's any control panels people are in love with. Apart from the issue of needing control panels mostly to solve problems, they're just not great. Windows legendarily keeps multiple versions of them, while for ios/macos it's a game of finding which image is actually a clickable button or understanding that wi-fi hotspot is under sharing and not networks. The FA was about command line incantation to fix printers and of course at every new macos version there will be a set of new defaults to get back behaviors. I think that's just the way of life at this point. reply overgard 11 hours agorootparentSure, but here's the thing, all they really have to do is... nothing. Just leave the old control panel alone and stop making new ones. Make small evolutions, not redesigns. It might not have been brilliant, but once people learned where things were there's very little upside to changing it and all sorts of downside. reply makeitdouble 10 hours agorootparentI think we're underestimating the amount of stuff going on in Windows and the amount of settings that are globaly needed after decades of trial and error. Right now, we have machines that basically do what macs do (traditional \"computing\", a mouse, a keyboard a screen, office or image related work). Then you have tablets (the whole Surface Pro line + 2 in 1 convertibles) and their touch options, including the impact on existing settings (you now have two or more sets of keyboards that might be in different mappings with different interlocked behaviors. Same for screens. and so much more) Then thin clients, mirroring and remoting. For mac it's remote desktop or screen mirroring at most. Windoes gets a flurry of inbetweens. Then all the hardware that only works on Windows and need some way to be managed relative to the system. All in all, mac made the choice to only cater to the proverbial 20 of the 20/80 power law. Windows fundamentally can't just pile on the existing chaos, even if it means bringing new layers of chaos. I don't even think a full rewrite in a new layer would be humanly possible at this point. reply Nition 8 hours agorootparentprev> I don't think there's any control panels people are in love with.

I could not care less what the settings UIs for home installs of Windows are. And that's the real truth, power users and these small fry IT install bases are not major markets. The most prominent markets are OEM installs for non-technical home users (who hate complex panels and love the push-button UIs), and large 3/4/5 digit enterprise installs that do not give a damn about this stuff because they're using MDT (or whatever) to deploy images to all their stations and not playing with this per-station configuration stuff. reply overgard 12 hours agorootparentI dunno man, with Steam on linux and most of the major game engines making porting easy (or at least moving in that direction) I have very few reasons to stick with Windows anymore. At this point it's basically Photoshop and Fusion 360, otherwise I'd abandon it completely. If they lose gamers, I think they'll have a real issue. reply nickelpro 12 hours agorootparentYou're a power user unable to understand the needs of non-power users. We all go through that stage, it's natural. I once installed Linux on all my siblings' desktops because I had convinced my parents it would lead to \"less viruses\" (Fedora 13, I think, GNOME 2, those were the days). The nightmare of providing support for that over the rest of my high school years provided me with a powerful and important lesson. You have few reasons to stick with Windows, you are a very, very tiny droplet in an ocean of users with different needs than you. Judging what such markets will do based on your personal needs is unwise. reply overgard 11 hours agorootparentHere's the thing though, the desktop now really is about power users or corporate users, because everyone else just uses cell phones or tablets. So ok, sure, your sales people and your secretaries probably aren't going to care about the control panel, but people that use computers outside of work are mostly going to be power users and they're starting to have options. (I can use all the software I need on macOS, and linux is rapidly getting there too) And honestly, breaking Printers is a thing that everyone is going to care about, especially people in a workplace. reply nickelpro 11 hours agorootparentAs explained above this is irrelevant to enterprise users, corpo installs don't play with per-station configuration like this or care about consumer-facing UIs, the needs of that market revolve around things like image management, deployment, and active directory administration. You're right that the home market is shrinking though, the OEM install market is down billions in revenue and has been dropping by double digit percentages each fiscal year, but you're wrong in your assumption that the power user market is worth anything. Power users, represented by direct license installs, are a rounding error of Windows revenue. There's nothing worth fighting for there. Convincing Mom that she should buy a Windows laptop instead of an Apple laptop is still worth ~$750M/Q, and Mom doesn't ever want to see the old Windows panels, she loves the \"Add Printer\" button. Convincing Timmy Q Hacker that he should buy a Windows license key instead of installing Arch Linux is worth squat. reply overgard 11 hours agorootparentI think you're overestimating the importance of the revenue generated and underestimating the importance of mindshare and people caring about their system. If the next generation of creators (IE, coders, designers, etc.) grow up on macOS and linux then Microsoft has a real problem down the line. The Windows monopoly has been VERY good to them, they would be foolish to lose it by angering their most passionate users even if in the short term they don't see an effect on their bottom line. reply nickelpro 11 hours agorootparent> I think you're overestimating the importance of the revenue generated It is literally impossible to do this. Revenue is the only thing that matters when measuring markets. If it doesn't affect the bottom line, it does not matter. Passion does not sell OEM installs or license keys. Creators and hackers didn't buy MS products in appreciable numbers to begin with (compared to consumer and enterprise markets), so to the degree MS can be said to be losing them, MS does not care. If moms and humanities majors stopped buying laptops entirely and that $750M/Q dropped to the ~$1M/Q the power users drive, MS would probably pull out of the OEM license market. This is a very different mindset about how businesses operate than you seem to share, which is fine, I'm explaining it not trying to convert you to it. reply Propelloni 10 hours agorootparentYou are certainly right about revenue. You say you are in enterprise IT, I used to be there. I actually built and was responsible for the IT of one of the few larger \"Linux only\" enterprises in the mid-2010s in Germany (like you said, Fedora and Gnome2. Ubuntu and Gnome2 for us). When I left we were talking about a 1000 seats. Needless to say, it worked mostly flawless. Yet we always had the same \"battle\" with new joiners, unfamiliar work environments. We had to move accounting (20 seats) to MS Windows so that accountants would come to work for us. No matter that the 20 seats caused three times the support compared to the Linux seats, no accounting is still worse ;) Anyhow, that's what Microsoft is abandoning. Familiarity. If young people do not learn MS Windows and MS Office during school or at home, the grip on the enterprise will vanish. We already see it in tech-oriented departments, where Macbooks reign supreme. I for one wouldn't like to use a Macbook, but I sincerely hope that MS grip on enterprises is broken sooner rather than later. reply hackerlight 11 hours agorootparentprevHow was the old school control panel not better for non power users?

The only thing you can do is make the \"Add Printer\" button as good as possible. The least common denominator is so much lower than you think it is. It's why Jobs and Timmy Apple worked so hard to eliminate the concept of the \"file system\" and make everything built around the concept of the \"app\".

Look at the feedback on Windows Me, Windows 8, The IE monopoly, breaking web standards, etc etc. reply trealira 12 hours agorootparentprevMainly because - There's so much existing software for Windows on x86 computers that it may not be feasible to migrate to MacOS or Linux. - Windows does improve sometimes, and security updates are important. There's nothing forcing anyone to stop using Windows, like if it were abandoned. But just because it hasn't happened so far doesn't mean it won't. MacOS market share has risen. Windows used to have 85% market share, but now it's 53%, and MacOS accounts for 31% of US desktop systems.[0] Perhaps that's just because the desktop market shrank, though. Maybe in the future, 64-bit ARM Macs will be the standard workstation like Windows PCs, with a minority running Linux on their Macs instead. I don't like that future, though; as much as Windows sucks, at least they don't try to limit user freedom to the extent Apple does. If Windows stopped being profitable to continue for Microsoft, I'd hope another company would rise up and sell their own operating system. [0]: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3695172/statcounter-da... edit: It was 53% when the article was written. The statistics they link say it's now 64%. reply overgard 12 hours agorootparentprevWell in 2013 Windows had a 90% market share for desktop PC's, and now it's evidently down to 69%... so yeah, I'd say they have a problem. (Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-sha... ) reply FirmwareBurner 12 hours agorootparentWhat problem? In 2013 Microsoft only had 2-3 big products, Windows, Office and X-Box. Now it's significantly more divested and the company's growth no longer depends on Windows' success or failure, and the stock pricing reflects that. reply overgard 12 hours agorootparentSo, you're saying that losing 21% of their OS market share by actively pissing off their customers shouldn't be seen as a problem? OS stagnation would be an improvement compared to what they're currently doing. reply FirmwareBurner 12 hours agorootparentWhy is having even bigger market share so important? Android has bigger market share than iOS too yet iOS is the more profitable one. Microsoft cares about profit first, not unprofitable market share. Not saying they're right or wrong, just saying it seems to be working for their bottom line as Windows is less relevante towards that as the PC market has been in a continuous decline anyway in the last decade. Fighting to capture more % of a declining market seems like a fool's errand, when they have bigger fish to fry now. reply dijit 12 hours agorootparentwhy is being unable to maintain market share not an issue? Because of revenue? a large seller of windows is genuinely just it’s market cap, it doesn’t really have a lot of killer utility compared to contemporaries. If it loses market cap then it’s a precipitous issue for them as there’s no point choosing the OS for other reasons, it simply lacks the value. It’s market cap comes from people thinking it has a huge audience and so tailoring software for that audience and putting significant resources into that. Without that third-party effort: windows is toast. reply FirmwareBurner 11 hours agorootparent>why is being unable to maintain market share not an issue? Because unless you're from the 90's, the market for desktop operating systems is not one that generates a lot of revenue anymore. That's like laughing at Netflix for loosing DVD rental market share to Blockbuster. >Because of revenue? See my comment above. Microsoft makes a fuck tonne of revenue from services no matter if your company doesn't buy Windows PCs. If they buy Macs, they'll still pay Microsoft subscription fees for Office 365, Outlook, OneDrive, Azure, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. and soon Copilot AI stuff. All these are platform agnostic and way more profitable for them than selling more Windows licenses. reply dijit 11 hours agorootparentoffice365 will die without windows, it’s genuinely terrible on every non-windows platform and onedrive is objectively worse than alternatives too.

Worse, sometimes its hard to get Linux native software to run on your choice of distro due to it not being available in your distro repositories yet (flatpaks are changing that but still not a perfect solution) or it being some proprietary software that was really only tested on some old version of Readhat meant for high end workstations which requires you to run some arcane scripts on the command line to install and therefore tainting your whole installation, kinda defeating the purpose of running away from messy Windows installations. reply bee_rider 11 hours agorootparentI understand that there are closed source software tools used in science out there, but it seems pretty wrong-headed to me.

You can't suddenly change things and expect app developers to accept it like they do in OSX. This means they can't change Windows too much. Any new change creates lots of compromises and just slapping a new UI doesn't fix the underlying issue. This has been the case since forever, that's why Apple could survive and that's why we have Linux. It isn't worth for Microsoft for example, to change how program becomes initialized at system startup. What happens is that every program then will want to be initialized at Startup. The average windows user is used to have to close lots of garbage at system startup. Also dealing with pseudo-ads all around the OS and also edge.

    "title": "Decoding the DNS Hierarchical Structure",
    "originLink": "https://computer.rip/2024-02-11-the-top-of-the-DNS-hierarchy.html",
    "originBody": ">>> 2024-02-11 the top of the DNS hierarchy (PDF) In the past (in fact two years ago, proof I have been doing this for a while now!) I wrote about the \"inconvenient truth\" that structural aspects of the Internet make truly decentralized systems infeasible, due to the lack of a means to perform broadcast discovery. As a result, most distributed systems rely on a set of central, semi-static nodes to perform initial introductions. For example, Bitcoin relies on a small list of volunteer-operated domain names that resolve to known-good full nodes. Tor similarly uses a small set of central \"directory servers\" that provide initial node lists. Both systems have these lists hardcoded into their clients; coincidentally, both have nine trusted, central hostnames. This sort of problem exists in basically all distributed systems that operate in environments where it is not possible to shout into the void and hope for a response. The internet, for good historic reasons, does not permit this kind of behavior. Here we should differentiate between distributed and decentralized, two terms I do not tend to select very carefully. Not all distributed systems are decentralized, indeed, many are not. One of the easiest and most practical ways to organize a distributed system is according to a hierarchy. This is a useful technique, so there are many examples, but a prominent and old one happens to also be part of the drivetrain mechanics of the internet: DNS, the domain name system. My reader base is expanding and so I will provide a very brief bit of background. Many know that DNS is responsible for translating human-readable names like \"computer.rip\" into the actual numerical addresses used by the internet protocol. Perhaps a bit fewer know that DNS, as a system, is fundamentally organized around the hierarchy of these names. To examine the process of resolving a DNS name, it is sometimes more intuitive to reverse the name, and instead of \"computer.rip\", discuss \"rip.computer\" [1]. This name is hierarchical, it indicates that the record \"computer\" is within the zone \"rip\". \"computer\" is itself a zone and can contain yet more records, we tend to call these subdomains. But the term \"subdomain\" can be confusing as everything is a subdomain of something, even \"rip\" itself, which in a certain sense is a subdomain of the DNS root \".\" (which is why, of course, a stricter writing of the domain name computer.rip would be computer.rip., but as a culture we have rejected the trailing root dot). Many of us probably know that each level of the DNS hierarchy has authoritative nameservers, operated typically by whoever controls the name (or their third-party DNS vendor). \"rip\" has authoritative DNS servers provided by a company called Rightside Group, a subsidiary of the operator of websites like eHow that went headfirst into the great DNS land grab and snapped up \"rip\" as a bit of land speculation, alongside such attractive properties as \"lawyer\" and \"navy\" and \"republican\" and \"democrat\", all of which I would like to own the \"computer\" subdomain of, but alas such dictionary words are usually already taken. \"computer.rip\", of course, has authoritative nameservers operated by myself or my delegate. Unlike some people I know, I do not have any nostalgia for BIND, and so I pay a modest fee to a commercial DNS operator to do it for me. Some would be surprised that I pay for this; DNS is actually rather inexpensive to operate and authoritative name servers are almost universally available as a free perk from domain registrars and others. I just like to pay for this on the general feeling that companies that charge for a given service are probably more committed to its quality, and it really costs very little and changing it would take work. To the observant reader, this might leave an interesting question. If even the top-level domains are subdomains of a secret, seldom-seen root domain \".\", who operates the authoritative name servers for that zone? And here we return to the matter of even distributed systems requiring central nodes. Bitcoin uses nine harcoded domain names for initial discovery of decentralized peers. DNS uses thirteen harcoded root servers to establish the top level of the hierarchy. These root servers are commonly referred to as a.root-servers.net through m.root-servers.net, and indeed those are their domain names, but remember that when we need to use those root servers we have no entrypoint into the DNS hierarchy and so are not capable of resolving names. The root servers are much more meaningfully identified by their IP addresses, which are \"semi-harcoded\" into recursive resolves in the form of what's often called a root hints file. You can download a copy, it's a simple file in BIND zone format that BIND basically uses to bootstrap its cache. And yes, there are other DNS implementations too, a surprising number of them, even in wide use. But when talking about DNS history we can mostly stick to BIND. BIND used to stand for Berkeley Internet Name Domain, and it is an apt rule of thumb in computer history that anything with a reference to UC Berkeley in the name is probably structurally important to the modern technology industry. One of the things I wanted to get at, when I originally talked about central nodes in distributed systems, is the impact it has on trust and reliability. The TOR project is aware that the nine directory servers are an appealing target for attack or compromise, and technical measures have been taken to mitigate the possibility of malicious behavior. The Bitcoin project seems to mostly ignore that the DNS seeds exist, but of course the design of the Bitcoin system limits their compromise to certain types of attacks. In the case of DNS, much like most decentralized systems, there is a layer of long-lived caching for top-level domains that mitigates the impact of unavailability of the root servers, but still, in every one of these systems, there is the possibility of compromise or unavailability if the central nodes are attacked. And so there is always a layer of policy. A trusted operator can never guarantee the trustworthiness of a central node (the node could be compromised, or the trusted operator could turn out to be the FBI), but it sure does help. Tor's directory servers are operated by the Tor project. Bitcoin's DNS seeds are operated by individuals with a long history of involvement in the project. DNS's root nodes are operated by a hodgepodge of companies and institutions that were important to the early internet. Verisign operates two, of course. A California university operates one, of course, but amusingly not Berkeley. Three are operated by various arms of US defense. Some internet industry associations, an NCC, another university, ICANN runs one of them themselves. It's pretty random, though, and just reflects a set of organizations prominently involved in the early internet. Some people, even some journalists I've come across, hear that there are 13 name servers and picture 13 4U boxes with a lot of blinking lights in heavily fortified data centers. Admittedly this description was more or less accurate in the early days, and a couple of the smaller root server operators did have single machines until surprisingly recently. But today, all thirteen root server IP addresses are anycast groups. Anycast is not a concept you run into every day, because it's not really useful on local networks where multicast can be used. But it's very important to the modern internet. The idea is this: an IP address (really a subnetwork) is advertised by multiple BGP nodes. Other BGP nodes can select the advertisement they like the best, typically based on lowest hop count. As a user, you connect to a single IP address, but based on the BGP-informed routing tables of internet service providers your traffic could be directed to any number of sites. You can think of it as a form of load balancing at the IP layer, but it also has the performance benefit of users mostly connecting to nearby nodes, so it's widely used by CDNs for multiple reasons. For DNS, though, where we often have a bootstrapping problem to solve, anycast is extremely useful as a way to handle \"special\" IP addresses that are used directly. For authoritative DNS servers like 192.5.5.241 [2001:500:2f::f] [2] (root server F) or recursive resolvers like 8.8.8.8 [2001:4860:4860::8888] (Google public DNS), anycast is the secret that allows a \"single\" address to correspond to a distributed system of nodes. So there are thirteen DNS root servers in the sense that there are thirteen independently administered clusters of root servers (with the partial exception of A and J, both operated by Verisign, due to their acquisition of former A operator Network Solutions). Each of the thirteen root servers is, in practice, a fairly large number of anycast sites, sometimes over 100. The root server operators don't share much information about their internal implementation, but one can assume that in most cases the anycast sites consist of multiple servers as well, fronted by some sort of redundant network appliance. There may only be thirteen of them, but each of the thirteen is quite robust. For example, the root servers typically place their anycast sites in major internet exchanges distributed across both geography and provider networks. This makes it unlikely that any small number of failures would seriously affect the number of available sites. Even if a root server were to experience a major failure due to some sort of administration problem, there are twelve more. Why thirteen, you might ask? No good reason. The number of root servers basically grew until the answer to an NS request for \".\" hit the 512 byte limit on UDP DNS responses. Optimizations over time allowed this number to grow (actually using single letters to identify the servers was one of these optimizations, allowing the basic compression used in DNS responses to collapse the matching root-servers.net part). Of course IPv6 blew DNS response sizes completely out of the water, leading to the development of the EDNS extension that allows for much larger responses. 13 is no longer the practical limit, but with how large some of the 13 are, no one sees a pressing need to add more. Besides, can you imagine the political considerations in our modern internet environment? The proposed operator would probably be Cloudflare or Google or Amazon or something and their motives would never be trusted. Incidentally, many of the anycast sites for root server F (operated by ISC) are Cloudflare data centers used under agreement. We are, of course, currently trusting the motives of Verisign. You should never do this! But it's been that way for a long time, we're already committed. At least it isn't Network Solutions any more. I kind of miss when SRI was running DNS and military remote viewing. But still, there's something a little uncomfortable about the situation. Billions of internet hosts depend on thirteen \"servers\" to have any functional access to the internet. What if someone attacked them? Could they take the internet down? Wouldn't this cause a global crisis of a type seldom before seen? Should I be stockpiling DNS records alongside my canned water and iodine pills? Wikipedia contains a great piece of comedic encyclopedia writing. In its article on the history of attacks on DNS root servers, it mentions the time, in 2012, that some-pastebin-user-claiming-to-be-Anonymous (one of the great internet security threats of that era) threatened to \"shut the Internet down\". \"It may only last one hour, maybe more, maybe even a few days,\" the statement continues. \"No matter what, it will be global. It will be known.\" That's the end of the section. Some Wikipedia editor, no doubt familiar with the activities of Anonymous in 2012, apparently considered it self-evident that the attack never happened. Anonymous may not have put in the effort, but others have. There have been several apparent DDoS attacks on the root DNS servers. One, in 2007, was significant enough that four of the root servers suffered---but there were nine more, and no serious impact was felt by internet users. This attack, like most meaningful DDoS, originated with a botnet. It had its footprint primarily in Korea, but C2 in the United States. The motivation for the attack, and who launched it, remains unknown. There is a surprisingly large industry of \"booters,\" commercial services that, for a fee, will DDoS a target of your choice. These tend to be operated by criminal groups with access to large botnets; the botnets are sometimes bought and sold and get their tasking from a network of resellers. It's a competitive industry. In the past, booters and botnet operators have sometimes been observed announcing a somewhat random target and taking it offline as, essentially, a sales demonstration. Since these demonstrations are a known behavior, any time a botnet targets something important for no discernible reason, analysts have a tendency to attribute it to a \"show of force.\" I have little doubt that this is sometimes true, but as with the tendency to attribute monumental architecture to deity worship, it might be an overgeneralization of the motivations of botnet operators. Sometimes I wonder if they made a mistake, or maybe they were just a little drunk and a lot bored, who is to say? The problem with this kind of attribution is evident in the case of the other significant attack on the DNS root servers, in 2015. Once again, some root servers were impacted badly enough that they became unreliable, but other root servers held on and there was little or even no impact to the public. This attack, though, had some interesting properties. In the 2007 incident, the abnormal traffic to the root servers consisted of large, mostly-random DNS requests. This is basically the expected behavior of a DNS attack; using randomly generated hostnames in requests ensures that the responses won't be cached, making the DNS server exert more effort. Several major botnet clients have this \"random subdomain request\" functionality built in, normally used for attacks on specific authoritative DNS servers as a way to take the operator's website offline. Chinese security firm Qihoo 360, based on a large botnet honeypot they operate, reports that this type of DNS attack was very popular at the time. The 2015 attack was different, though! Wikipedia, like many other websites, describes the attack as \"valid queries for a single undisclosed domain name and then a different domain the next day.\" In fact, the domain names were disclosed, by at least 2016. The attack happened on two days. On the first day, all requests were for 336901.com. The second day, all requests were for 916yy.com. Contemporaneous reporting is remarkably confused on the topic of these domain names, perhaps because they were not widely known, perhaps because few reporters bothered to check up on them thoroughly. Many sources make it sound like they were random domain names perhaps operated by the attacker, one goes so far as to say that they were registered with fake identities. Well, my Mandarin isn't great, and I think the language barrier is a big part of the confusion. No doubt another part is a Western lack of familiarity with Chinese internet culture. To an American in the security industry, 336901.com would probably look at first like the result of a DGA or domain generation algorithm. A randomly-generated domain used specifically to be evasive. In China, though, numeric names like this are quite popular. Qihoo 360 is, after all, domestically branded as just 360---360.cn. As far as I can tell, both domains were pretty normal Chinese websites related to mobile games. It's difficult or maybe impossible to tell now, but it seems reasonable to speculate that they were operated by the same company. I would assume they were something of a gray market operation, as there's a huge intersection between \"mobile games,\" \"gambling,\" and \"target of DDoS attacks.\" For a long time, perhaps still today in the right corners of the industry, it was pretty routine for gray-market gambling websites to pay booters to DDoS each other. In a 2016 presentation, security researchers from Verisign (Weinberg and Wessels) reported on their analysis of the attack based on traffic observed at Verisign root servers. They conclude that the traffic likely originated from multiple botnets or at least botnet clients with different configurations, since the attack traffic can be categorized into several apparently different types [3]. Based on command and control traffic from a source they don't disclose (perhaps from a Verisign honeynet?), they link the attack to the common \"BillGates\" [4] botnet. Most interestingly, they conclude that it was probably not intended as an attack on the DNS root: the choice of fixed domain names just doesn't make sense, and the traffic wasn't targeted at all root servers. Instead, they suspect it was just what it looks like: an attack on the two websites the packets queried for, that for some reason was directed at the root servers instead of the authoritative servers for that second-level domain. This isn't a good strategy; the root servers are a far harder target than your average web hosting company's authoritative servers. But perhaps it was a mistake? An experiment to see if the root server operators might mitigate the DDoS by dropping requests for those two domains, incidentally taking the websites offline? Remember that Qihoo 360 operates a large honeynet and was kind enough to publish a presentation on their analysis of root server attacks. Matching Verisign's conclusions, they link the attack to the BillGates botnet, and also note that they often observe multiple separate botnet C2 servers send tasks targeting the same domain names. This probably reflects the commercialized nature of modern botnets, with booters \"subcontracting\" operations to multiple botnet operators. It also handily explains Verisign's observation that the 2015 attack traffic seems to have come from more than one implementation a DNS DDoS. 360 reports that, on the first day, five different C2 servers tasked bots with attacking 336901.com. On the second day, three C2 servers tasked for 916yy.com. But they also have a much bigger revelation: throughout the time period of the attacks, they observed multiple tasks to attack 916yy.com using several different methods. 360 concludes that the 2015 DNS attack was most likely the result of a commodity DDoS operation that decided to experiment, directing traffic at the DNS roots instead of the authoritative server for the target to see what would happen. I doubt they thought they'd take down the root servers, but it seems totally reasonable that they might have wondered if the root server operators would filter DDoS traffic based on the domain name appearing in the requests. Intriguingly, they note that some of the traffic originated with a DNS attack tool that had significant similarities to BillGates but didn't produce quite the same packets. Likely we will never know, but a likely explanation is that some group modified the BillGates DNS attack module or implemented a new one based on the method used by BillGates. Tracking botnets gets very confusing very fast, there are just so many different variants of any major botnet client! BillGates originated, for example, as a Linux botnet. It was distributed to servers, not only through SSH but through vulnerabilities in MySQL and ElasticSearch. It was unusual, for a time, in being a major botnet that skipped over the most common desktop operating system. But ports of BillGates to Windows were later observed, distributed through an Internet Explorer vulnerability---classic Windows. Why someone chose to port a Linux botnet to Windows instead of using one of the several popular Windows botnets (Conficker, for example) is a mystery. Perhaps they had spent a lot of time building out BillGates C2 infrastructure and, like any good IT operation, wanted to simplify their cloud footprint. High in the wizard's tower of the internet, thirteen elders are responsible for starting every recursive resolver on its own path to truth. There's a whole Neal Stephenson for Wired article there. But in practice it's a large and robust system. The extent of anycast routing used for the root DNS servers, to say nothing of CDNs, is one of those things that challenges are typical stacked view of the internet. Geographic load balancing is something we think of at high layers of the system, it's surprising to encounter it as a core part of a very low level process. That's why we need to keep our thinking flexible: computers are towers of abstraction, and complexity can be added at nearly any level, as needed or convenient. Seldom is this more apparent than it is in any process called \"bootstrapping.\" Some seemingly simpler parts of the internet, like DNS, rely on a great deal of complexity within other parts of the system, like BGP. Now I'm just complaining about pedagogical use of the OSI model again. [1] The fact that the DNS hierarchy is written from right-to-left while it's routinely used in URIs that are otherwise read left-to-right is one of those quirks of computer history. Basically an endianness inconsistency. Like American date order, to strictly interpret a URI you have to stop and reverse your analysis part way through. There's no particular reason that DNS is like that, there was just less consistency over most significant first/least significant first hierarchical ordering at the time and contemporaneous network protocols (consider the OSI stack) actually had a tendency towards least significant first. [2] The IPv4 addresses of the root servers are ages old and mostly just a matter of chance, but the IPv6 addresses were assigned more recently and allowed an opportunity for something more meaningful. Reflecting the long tradition of identifying the root servers by their letter, many root server operators use IPv6 addresses where the host part can be written as the single letter of the server (i.e. root server C at [2001:500:2::c]). Others chose a host part of \"53,\" a gesture at the port number used for DNS (i.e. root server J, [2001:7fe::53]). Others seem more random, Verisign uses 2:30 for both of their root servers (i.e. root server A, [2001:503:ba3e::2:30]), so maybe that means something to them, or maybe it was just convenient. Amusingly, the only operator that went for what I would call an address pun is the Defense Information Systems Agency, which put root server G at [2001:500:12::d0d]. [3] It really dates this story that there was some controversy around the source IPs of the attack, originating with none other than deceased security industry personality John McAfee. He angrily insisted that it was not plausible that the source IPs were spoofed. Of course botnets conducting DDoS attacks via DNS virtually always spoof the source IP, as there are few protections in place (at the time almost none at all) to prevent it. But John McAfee has always had a way of ginning up controversy where none was needed. [4] Botnets are often bought, modified, and sold. They tend to go by various names from different security researchers and different variants. I'm calling this one \"BillGates\" because that's the funniest of the several names used for it.",

This usually does not help in case of DNS. Let's say a resolver queries a root that does not reply. The resolver will time out after n seconds and then try another root server, but will not send any replies to the querying client. Therefore, the querying client has no way to know if it's the resolver that is broken or the upstream authoritative server and the querying client itself will timeout after m seconds and switch to another resolver, ignoring any possible later response from the first initialized query. If m is larger or equal to n, the problem is aparent -- client will never know if the root is broken or the resolver, usually treating the resolver as such. reply mike_d 14 hours agoparentMaybe for a query or two, but the problem sorts itself out. Auth servers are very rarely running from a completely cold cache. Additionally most resolver software uses a system called scoreboarding where response times for each IP are recorded and it will prefer the fastest known nameserver for a query (some number of queries are still periodically sent to \"slower\" or unknown servers to gather metrics for them). Clients never treat a system resolver as \"broken.\" Most operating systems will round-robin the list of available recursive servers when there is a timeout before returning failure to the software. In the case of web browsers and such, they'll retry with a resolver operated by the browser vendor before admitting defeat. reply hardaker 5 hours agorootparentMinor note: authoritative servers don't have caches. I think you meant recursive resolver (or better \"caching resolver\" which covers other types of resolvers that may also be caching, such as some stub-resolvers). reply fanf2 15 hours agoparentprevTraditionally (in the Berkeley code) the timeouts in the stub resolver in libc are 3x longer than the timeouts in the iterative resolver in the recursive server.

Which wouldn't have worked even if it worked. When a recursive nameserver asks the root servers for the address of \"916yy.com\", the root servers are just going to direct it to the .com servers. Which the recursive nameserver already knows when it has the address of the .com servers cached, as would be the case >99% of the time, and would ask them directly instead of bothering the root servers to begin with. Even in the rare case when the recursive nameserver doesn't have the address of the .com servers cached yet, that condition would last for approximately zero seconds before someone tries to resolve some other .com domain name and it gets cached, typically for at least a day. reply paulddraper 6 hours agoparentSurely there are a number of resolvers who have a cold cache. But yes, even taking down every root server (temporarily) has a limited effect. reply zrm 2 hours agorootparentWe're not talking about taking down the root servers, we're talking about the root servers mitigating the attack by dropping requests for that specific .com domain name. That would have no effect on any recursive resolver that had the .com nameservers cached, which is substantially all of them because it happens as soon as they resolve any other .com domain name. That happens immediately and continuously even for small nameservers. You would have a window of under a second once every TTL (currently 48 hours for gtld-servers.net, the nameservers for .com) between when the cached entry expires and when the next request for some other .com domain name comes in and refreshes it with a request to the root servers that they'd actually answer. reply calvinmorrison 17 hours agoprevOne thing that surprises me is that there isn't more competition in this space.

If OpenNIC is registering names under .pirate and ICANN is aware of this then it can simply refrain from using .pirate as a TLD and you still have a unified namespace. It just happens by consensus rather than central authority. If they would get along a little better then you might even have the ICANN root servers direct queries for those TLDs to the OpenNIC servers. It's not obvious what benefit is achieved by not doing this. reply hardaker 5 hours agorootparentYou may wish to read [RFC9476], which provides a solution for anchoring alternate name spaces in a way that provides both a signalling point for establishing that you've left the DNS and a way to prevent collisions with the DNS itself. [RFC9476]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9476.html reply zrm 2 hours agorootparentThis doesn't help much to prevent collisions though, does it? An alternate namespace is obviously not going to use a TLD that already exists in the DNS, but it's much more likely to use one that exists in a different alternate namespace they've never heard of, since those will be more obscure and more likely to be missed. Putting them both under .alt does nothing to prevent this. What you're really doing is reserving all of the as yet unallocated namespace to the DNS, privileging it over any alternatives which then have to use longer names. What you need is a mechanism for alternate namespaces to register their use of a particular subset of the global namespace against both other alternate namespaces and the DNS, at which point you wouldn't need to put them all under .alt. They also immediately damaged that subset of the namespace: > DNS stub and recursive resolvers do not need to look them up in the DNS context. Now some DNS stub resolver implementers or administrators will read this and reject any queries under .alt, making it unsuitable for any namespace you would like intermediary resolvers to look up in an upstream server that supports them. reply zokier 13 hours agoparentprevAfaik Russia has its own DNS roots under their \"sovereign internet\" program, see for example \"3.

All we need to do is write a browser extension with an input text box which connects to a blockchain and uses it to map custom names to IP addresses (with the mappings stored on-chain) and redirects the user to the IP address directly. The only centralized component is the initial peer discovery phase which requires some hard-coded seed IPs but you could have a large list and rotate the seed list frequently. Anyway, once set up, it would be fully decentralized... You could already do this by using any generic blockchain like Bitcoin. Just use transaction messages to store name-to-IP mappings. The seed peer discovery issue is not a big problem once the network is above a certain size. Beyond a certain point, you could just ask someone from your local community for the IP address of a node. You just need one good node to be able to connect to the network. reply miniBill 2 hours agoparentHow do you avoid squatting? reply teddyh 17 hours agoprev> BIND used to stand for Berkeley Internet Name Domain Surely “Berkeley Internet Name Daemon”? reply rascul 16 hours agoparent> Surely “Berkeley Internet Name Daemon”?

In a small suburban neighborhood where the grass was always greener on the other side, one resident took \"keeping up with the Joneses\" to a whole new level. Meet Harold Grimsby, a man with a vision—or rather, a nuclear one. Tired of paying exorbitant electricity bills and wanting to make a statement, Harold decided to power his entire home with a mini nuclear reactor. Neighbors initially scoffed at Harold's eccentricity, but their laughter turned to envy when they learned of his genius plan. With the surplus energy produced by his reactor, Harold began feeding back into the grid, raking in a whopping $200k per month.

Very few customers are willing to pay for two separate connections, and routing overlapping electrical transmission networks is expensive in space and likely unsightly. There's a few options for natural monopolies. Regulated standards and practices, and tarrifs can be effective. Public ownership can be effective. Mandating divestiture can be effective. A market works pretty ok for generation. Although, a system operator that coordinates to provide stability seems like a requirement. I think there's potential for a market approach in long distance transmission; the operator could identify unmet transmission needs (sector A often has excess/curtailed generation, sector B often has excess/curtailed loads; maybe we should increase transmission capacity through those links), and run a bid process to solve those needs. I think the high price to build long distance transmission means you do want to have coordinated planning though: you don't want to massively overbuild transmission capacity on one path. reply onthecanposting 3 hours agorootparentprevSometimes they can.

(1) In standard economics the way to exploit a monopoly is by supplying less to customers than what a competitive market would provide. That enables you to charge more. There are at least two ways to get around that: you can try extensive regulation, or you can auction off the right to run the 'natural monopoly'. A competitive auction open to all comers will naturally capture whatever extra revenue exploitation of the monopoly could bring. (You can also mix and match.) (2) The second concern is about who should own the entity that provides the service in question. You claim that it should not be the private sector, but don't bring any arguments for it.

The \"Power, Profit, and Control\" section outlines that: 1) The competitors who would profit from the interconnects don't think they are profitable to build. 2) The money is better spent building more power plants. 3) Smaller interconnects are less risky. And the plan to combat this in \"Help on the Hill\" is to try and force companies to do things that they don't want to do. It'd be much more sensible to deregulate and let the people who profit build the interconnects. I note that the people sponsoring the bills are US democrats.

Or is it just general policy manoeuvring? reply bruce511 7 hours agoparent>> It'd be much more sensible to deregulate and let the people who profit build the interconnects. Firstly, it's worth saying that in markets with high barrier-to-entry costs, it's not easy for the \"market\" to protect against profiteering. Or put another way, if the local utility decides to charge more, its not like you can just build a power station, and connect to the grid, to undercut and take a profit. Equally, given the cost of starting up, concessions are made to protect monopolies (or semi monopolies) to avoid unnecessary duplication of infrastructure. Regulations though can be good, or bad, depending on your point of view. They either work for the business (keeping out competition) or for the consumer (preventing price gouging.) And it's not just today's profits that matter but tomorrow's as well. If I'm allowed to charge more during periods of high demand, that encourages me to increase scarcity. I'm incentived to provide less power, and get more profit. So deregulation likely ends badly for the consumer. It likely leads to scarcity since that improves profits. On the other hand deregulation has allowed me to have residential solar, dropping my energy bill by 80%. And high prices make that financially attractive. So some deregulation good? My point is that the balance between regulator, provider and consumer is a very fine one, and messing with that balance can have consequences. reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparentDeregulation in high-capital, long-lead-time, must-serve markets like energy, telecom, and emergency medicine has generally ended badly. Because eventually someone realizes profit can be maximized by (minimizing investment) + (maximizing risk) + (increasing prices) + (appealing for government bailouts whenever catastrophe strikes). A utility commission that looks skeptically at rate increases, but in return provides a more stable rate that industry can use to plan long-term expansions against, works better.

Technically it is pretty easy. Buy some solar panels or a diesel generator. Grid access is a harder but as far as I've seen the limiting factor is going to be government policy. You won't be cost competitive with state of the art .... but that implies that the grid prices are fair so you won't be able to drive prices down with any amount of capital. People don't build new plants often, but that is because high prices are going to be caused by (1) that is the best anyone can do or (2) the government is enforcing regulation that makes competition impossible and in rare cases (3) someone else is already building new power plants faster and better than they can, so it is a waste of effort.

It isn't a concern (the grid is cooked, but not because of peak prices). The market is signalling that it is worth having capacity available just for the peak - the cost of that type of redundancy is high, so the prices need to be high to make it happen.

Electricity in Texas is about twice as high than California. The 180x spike last only a few hours in a few spots. The consumer's total costs over the course of a year are lower in Texas than a California, by a large magnitude. I realize some people just had a perfect storm of a large monthly bill, but seems like that could be solved by more regulation on the pricing cap side while still leaving the production to be a more open system. I believe Texas has already moved in that direction. reply danans 3 hours agorootparent> I realize some people just had a perfect storm of a large monthly bill, but seems like that could be solved by more regulation on the pricing cap side while still leaving the production to be a more open system. Adding price cap regulation will necessarily raise the average prices to pay for the occasions that the price goes 180x, or even 30x. There's no free lunch. reply beaeglebeached 7 hours agorootparentprevDecentralized generators and propane heaters are far most robust and economical vs reworking an entire grid for rare events like that. The dead mostly have themselves to blame for their stupidity and lack of self reliance. Id vote to keep it as is. Let natural selection work it out. reply nixgeek 7 hours agorootparentNot everyone should need a generator and a fuel store. Not everyone lives in housing which can even accommodate storing these safely, or operating them safely. These are exactly the issues I'd expect a well functioning government to actually solve, not \"let natural selection work it out\". What a horrible take, please can we not make light of 246 people prematurely dying across 77 counties in Texas, or imply somehow those 246 people were at fault? reply beaeglebeached 6 hours agorootparentFar more than 246 lives would be lost reworking the grid once you account for the fact it would take 246+ life years of manpower to rework the grid for the feds blood sacrifice they require before declaring Texan grid kosher. reply spdustin 8 hours agorootparentprev [–] Texas runs their own grid, precisely to avoid federal government regulation. reply 7thaccount 7 hours agorootparent [–] They're still regulated by NERC and have nearly all the same institutions. For example, ERCOT does the same fundamental job as CAISO. The only difference is they aren't under FERC, and that does matter...just not as much as folks think. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
