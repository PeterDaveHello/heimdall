    "content": "I am dying of squamous cell carcinoma, and the treatments that might save me are just out of reachJuly 22, 2023By Jake Seligerin Books40 CommentsAlex Tabarrok writes about how \u201cwhen the FDA fails to approve a good drug, people die but the bodies are buried in an invisible graveyard.\u201d I\u2019d like to make that graveyard a little bit more visible because I\u2019m going to be buried in it, in a few weeks or months. A squamous cell carcinoma tumor appeared on my tongue last September; the surgery for it occurred in October, followed by radiation in December \u2013 January, but the tumor reappeared at the base of my tongue in April. A massive surgery on May 25 appeared to produce \u201cclean margins\u201d (that is, no tumor cells remained where the surgeon operated), albeit at huge cost: I have no tongue any more, just a \u201cflap\u201d of muscle where it used to be, and no ability to swallow solid foods ever again. Monday I\u2019m starting chemotherapy, but that\u2019s almost certainly going to fail, because a CT scan shows four to six new gross tumors, four in my neck and two, possibly, in my lungs.So what might help me? MRNA tumor vaccines. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are notoriously treatment resistant, and mRNA vaccines have shown huge promise. Why aren\u2019t they happening faster? Because the FDA is slow. There are some trials underway (here is one from Moderna; here is another), and, although I\u2019m trying to enroll, I may be too late, since my cancer moves so aggressively. The FDA was loathe to approve initial mRNA human trials, even when those trials would have been full of people like me: those who are facing death sentences anyway.Here is one story, from \u201cWhy the FDA Has an Incentive to Delay the Introduction of New Drugs:\u201dIn the early 1980s, when I headed the team at the FDA that was reviewing the NDA for recombinant human insulin, . . . we were ready to recommend approval a mere four months after the application was submitted (at a time when the average time for NDA review was more than two and a half years). With quintessential bureaucratic reasoning, my supervisor refused to sign off on the approval\u2014even though he agreed that the data provided compelling evidence of the drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness. \u201cIf anything goes wrong,\u201d he argued, \u201cthink how bad it will look that we approved the drug so quickly.\u201d (41)The problem is that delaying mRNA cancer vaccines kills people like me.We need to have a much stronger \u201cright to try\u201d presumption: \u201cWhen Dying Patients Want Unproven Drugs,\u201d we should let those patients try. I have weeks to months left; let\u2019s try whatever there is to try, and advance medicine along the way. The \u201cright to try\u201d is part of fundamental freedom\u2014and this is particularly true for palliative-stage patients without a route to a cure anyway. They are risking essentially nothing.When I am dead and buried at least those who I love and who love me will know the FDA protected me and millions of others like me from ourselves. Thanks, FDA. But the dead do not vote and do not agitate for change, so the system is likely to grind on.In computer science there is a convention in which one\u2019s first program prints \u201cHello, world.\u201d Now it is my turn to write \u201cGoodbye, world.\u201d I\u2019m crying as I write this and am sorry to have to go so soon. I have to give back the gift, though with great sadness.Here is more about the FDA being slow and bureaucratic.EDIT: Thank you for all the comments and emails. Many of you have asked what you can do to help, and the simple answer is: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m being treated at the Mayo Clinic Phoenix, and they have a system set up for donations to support clinical trials, so maybe that is one answer. Maybe in the future others won\u2019t have to go through what I\u2019m going through.The author on July 22, 2023, when he is, or was, still alive.Share this:ShareRelatedMy novel, Asking Anna, is out todayJanuary 17, 2014In \"Books\"Facebook and cellphones might be really bad for relationshipsSeptember 14, 2012In \"Culture\"Links: Buried treasure, buried writers, buried education, surface hazards, and more!November 17, 2020In \"Links\"",

How would you celebrate the day ahead?\u201cWork,\u201d quipped Caltech chemistry professor Rudy Marcus at a lunch in honor of his centenary Friday.But the university where he\u2019s been on the faculty for 45 years had other plans, so the Nobel laureate good-naturedly agreed to a symposium in his honor.ADVERTISEMENTGenerations of Marcus\u2019 colleagues and former students gathered at the Athenaeum, Caltech\u2019s faculty club, to celebrate a scientist who still reports to the book-lined office he has occupied on the Pasadena campus since 1978, and whose inquisitiveness and generous spirit remains undimmed.Nobel laureate Rudy Marcus in his Caltech office, where he\u2019s a chemistry professor. (Corinne Purtill / Los Angeles Times)\u201cHe\u2019s an excellent example of what it is to be a scientist: the curiosity, the energy, the enthusiasm and the excitement for figuring things out,\u201d said Stephen Klippenstein, a former doctoral student of Marcus\u2019 who is now a theoretical chemist at Argonne National Laboratory.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him say a harsh word to anyone,\u201d Klippenstein added, echoing others who described Marcus as a role model both in and out of the lab. \u201cHe leads by example: Work hard and solve hard problems.\u201dAs a theoretical chemist, Marcus works with concepts rather than laboratory apparatus. He received his Nobel Prize in 1992 for work on electron transfer reactions, a deceptively simple theory describing how electrons move between molecules in chemical reactions without breaking chemical bonds.While experimental chemists produce compelling new results in the lab, Marcus seeks the elegant architecture that undergirds their findings.ADVERTISEMENTJack Y. Zhang, CEO and president of a pharmaceutical company, chats with Rudy Marcus, left, his former academic advisor, during the Nobel laureate\u2019s 100th birthday celebration at Caltech. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)It\u2019s an intellectual challenge that keeps him eager to return to his desk as his 11th decade begins. If anything, he said, his workload feels even more pressing as the sheer amount of intriguing experiments grows.\u201cThere are all sorts of developments in the laboratory and all sorts of new techniques that have been produced,\u201d he said Friday as well-wishers milled around his table at a pre-symposium lunch. \u201cI have plenty of work to do, more than I can comfortably handle.\u201dMarcus still publishes several research papers per year. The Office of Naval Research just renewed a grant he\u2019s had since the 1950s.Age has demanded some concessions. He walked to work each day from his house near the Pasadena campus until the age of 97, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced him to stop.He hung up his skis at the age of 90, not because he couldn\u2019t physically continue, but because it seemed unwise to do so.\u201cI\u2019d love to ski, but I\u2019d love not to break any bones,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce people get hospitalized, for some that\u2019s the beginning of the end, and there\u2019s too much to do yet.\u201dSCIENCE & MEDICINECaltech Scientist Wins the Nobel Chemistry PrizeOct. 15, 1992Marcus\u2019s work ethic is legendary, colleagues and family members said.When his eldest son Alan Marcus, a cultural historian and professor at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, decided to shift to part-time work as his 65th birthday approached, \u201cDad said, \u2018You\u2019re such a slacker,\u2019 \u201d the younger Marcus recalled with a laugh.Marcus was married to Laura Hearne from 1949 until her death from multiple myeloma in 2003. Their sons Alan, Kenneth and Raymond all obtained doctoral degrees in history.Marcus continued to teach until the age of 95, when he decided \u201cenough is enough.\u201d\u201cThey should really have somebody who really knows something,\u201d he said.Nobel laureate Rudy Marcus celebrated his 100th birthday with a day of festivities at Caltech, where he has worked since 1978.

At a hastily called news conference at the Toronto hotel where he was staying, the professor demurred when asked about the newfound fame that comes with being a Nobel laureate.\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to attract more attention to my work,\u201d a bemused Marcus told reporters. \u201cI just want more time to get it done.\u201dHe got his wish. His colleagues couldn\u2019t have foreseen the sheer longevity of his tenure when he arrived at Caltech during the Carter administration, \u201cbut the Nobel Prize quality, yes,\u201d said John D. Baldeschwieler, a retired professor emeritus of chemistry who was chair of the department at the time of Marcus\u2019 hiring.Marcus was born in 1923 in Montreal, the much-loved only child of Esther and Myer Marcus. His mother in particular instilled a love of learning, in part motivated by the fact that her own family lacked the money to continue her education beyond grade school.\u201cShe told me that when I was a baby and she used to wheel me in a carriage around McGill, she told me that I would go there,\u201d he said in an oral history collected by Caltech in 1993. (She was right: he earned both his bachelor\u2019s degree and doctorate at the prestigious Montreal university.)He was drawn to puzzles as a child, and has often described his approach to science as a decades-long continuation of the childlike pleasure of teasing a solution from once-scattered parts.\u201cThe main thing is finding something that you enjoy doing, that preferably doesn\u2019t harm others, and that tests whatever aptitude one has, that tests one\u2019s ingenuity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a kind of a game. You against nature.\u201d",

I always saw money as a means to an end, just another tool in the toolbox. I don't need more of it so that part of the drive is gone and I'd much rather spend a day playing piano or fixing something than that I'd want to be worried about metrics, investors, customer acquisition, payroll and the bi-annual whack over the head from the fourth dimension that throws all your carefully laid plans into disarray.But I do very much wish for you to succeed at whatever endeavor you've got lined up and I'm curious to hear about it. Much, much good luck with your plans.replyChuckMcM 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This situation/attitude is exactly the thing that great people end up in. As I've mentioned previously I have known a lot of people that developed enough wealth over time to \"retire.\"[1] And by retire I mean choose to work on what they wanted to work on, and not work if they didn't want to. I once explained as \"being a consultant with infinite days of paid vacation.\" Some folks like Jacques and the GP author are \"old\" (as in > 50 yrs old, (me too)), some I know are \"young\" in that they are under 40.In very general terms I see three \"types\" as most common, the first type are what I think of as \"score keepers\" who equate bank balances with their \"score\" in life and a bigger score than their peers mean they \"win\" life. This is not a point of view that I really understand, but I generally think that is because in my younger years I lived in Las Vegas and knew other kids whose parents were professional gamblers. Their life was really random in terms of how much money was available that year/month/week/day. Money came and went based most on luck, and less on skill. As a result these folks understood money wasn't the definition of how \"good\" they were, just how lucky. That is how I translated equity earnings from stock options / grants. If you happened to get lucky then you got some wealth, if not well it didn't change the quality of your work or your abilities.I see this a lot in the second type of person which is they are happy to not have to worry about money, but they don't \"need\" to generate any more. So they follow their passions which can be very different. One friend of mine became a patent attorney because they really liked the law and how that system worked.The third type is the person that \"fails\" at retirement (I put it in quotes because I don't think of it as failing, just a different path) and they miss the technical/intellectual challenge and the camaraderie of being in a group working on tough problems. If you get to be senior enough you come to realize that you can get more done as a group of blended skills than you can as individuals. Recreating that in a non-company way is hard.[2] As a result people often \"go back to work\". My favorite example of this is Guido Van-Rossum, who \"retired\", got bored, and then went to work for Microsoft.Tenured professorships are excellent for this third type as well. There isn't an industrial equivalent (there used to be, tech companies would have the title of \"Fellow\" but the grind of MBAs on margin over innovation has pretty much killed those in most places).[1] Not a flex, I just happened to be part of a number of companies that were generous with stock options and grew into larger companies. These are not founders, they are regular employees whose stock options ended up being worth enough that they could diversify them into something they could live off of.[2] I proposed a member-benefit type company arrangement that would address this need but have so far not pushed the idea into existence.replylifeisstillgood 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Are: your member-benefit idea - we live in an extreme mono-culture of company structures and I think any innovation there might help.

Things you don't worry about are 0. During normal life you worry about some things, and stuff surrounding work may even approach 1. Normal, because your family's well-being may depend on it. Then you retire or become unemployed and the 0 to 1 spectrum starts to drop in scope, the spectrum starts to cover a much narrower reality. Soon you worry and get annoyed by your neighbor not taking good care of his lawn or kids skating through the park... I've seen it happen to people retiring, I was once unemployed for 10 months and I felt it happen to me too.I then thought: Perhaps for me the working life, life filled with intellectual challenges, may never loose its appeal?!

The first impression is good. Here's some criticism:The first thing I look for in a issue tracker is the screen estate to write the task. I understand that some people write a list of issues in the form of short blurbs and iterate on them afterwards, but it always feels frustrating to me to having to write the title in a modal window, save and then open the issue again to be able to see a larger textarea for the description. I also see it as discouraging for people to write better descriptions for the issues they open.The keyboard navigation is probably not complete (press P to create a project, you would still need the mouse to focus the textbox and to save the project)On my computer it started in Dark Mode, and the experience overall was quite a bit disorientating.

A license can't force people to do work for free in the future.replyjillesvangurp 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It has that in common with essentially all other open source license. And it only extends to the version given to you under the license. The copyright holder(s) retain the right to change their mind. Which is a reason AGPL v3 is popular with companies that are looking to sell commercial licenses for their software. There are quite a few startups out there that attempted to keep control whose primary business model is providing a way out from the many restrictions the AGPL v3 imposes on users by offering a commercial license.In this case, it looks like Plane is not requiring copyright transfers. So that cuts off the practicality of them ever re-licensing their software (commercially or otherwise). That's a good thing as it means it is indeed not likely the license will ever change. The bad thing is that it would be hard to build a company around this project. The AGPLv3 is just very strict about having to open source any and all bundled features and imposes a lot of restrictions and requirements.replyrapnie 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What if a project has a plugin architecture and plugins are compiled files that can be dropped in at runtime? Those plugins can be any license then, is it not?replymaxloh 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]No. Those plugins call functions from AGPL's codebase and they are designed only to be combined with AGPL's work into a larger work, so they are derivative works.But there is a chance that CSS and svg icons are not required to be GPL.See WordPress clarification on themes' licensing: https://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/replyvoakbasda 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Plug-ins are generally considered a derived work, if directly written to use a specific API. You would need to build a module that works for many different systems and only uses the Plane APIs as a shim.Even then, the shim might be argued to be infected, and thus the rest of the module too.

This in itself also becomes an invaluable knowledge base over time, not to mention all the other benefits you get from support and engineering tracking their work in the same application.But of course, like all good things it didn't last, because the company was bought by some other company that thought it was absolutely insane to publicly admit that your software had bugs.replyanthonyskipper 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]^ You nailed it.

You can't easily have conversations about issues in Git and even if you could do you really want to have a commit for each message?I'm aware of some systems that try to tack issue tracking onto Git in a similar way to Fossil, but they just aren't as good as a proper issue tracker.That said, Jira is a terrible issue tracker. I do not understand how it is so bad given that it is literally its only job.I used Phabricator for issue tracking in my previous company and it was so far ahead of Jira... It makes no sense.Something as basic as parent/child issues is barely implemented in Jira. You can only have 2 levels of hierarchy.You can't put a task in your sprint unless it matches the task filter for that sprint, which means you can't easily track the work of people that work on multiple projects.You can't even put tasks from multiple projects into one sprint. Realistically you should have a single project for everything.They haven't even got basic stuff like \"refresh the page when information on it changes\" working.And that's before you even get to the core flaw of Jira which is that it encourages product managers to overcomplicate it.But just because Jira is awful doesn't mean issue trackers in general are. Phabricator's is great. GitHub and Gitlab are basic but decent. I haven't got experience with any others but I'm sure there are great ones.replysanitycheck 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As you touched on, the major problem with Jira is actually that it does so much nobody (roughly) knows how to use it.You get 3 levels if you include Epic (Epic > Task > Subtask).You can set up a sprint/kanban board filter to cover multiple projects, so this does actualy gives you multiple projects per sprint.I do agree that it's slow and doesn't update itself to reflect changes.The two groups of people who hate Jira the most are (1) those who can't get it to work how they want it to and (2) those who have to deal with someone else's mad/broken custom workflow.replyandrewaylett 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If you're Enterprise enough, you can have a lot more levels than that!We appear to have four levels of grouping above \"Epic\", albeit none of them are even visible in our sprints.replyIshKebab 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> You get 3 levels if you include Epic (Epic > Task > Subtask).Indeed but that's still an artificial limitation, and subtasks are not really fully featured tasks.replyRiverbank3929 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]this is very true.my team just merged with another, larger team.before this merge we operated off only github issues and never had problems with itnow we have length jira planning sessions, new meetings every 2-3 weeks on updated jira expectations, and a whole group of people whose job it is to track our jira usage and let us know if we aren't using it correctly / meeting standardsunder one system we always finished work ahead of time and could actively pursue more projectsunder one we are constantly behind the \"estimate\" for our assigned workcare to guess which is which?replygorgoiler 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Most of my \u201ctasks\u201d are buggy, poorly written, feature incomplete, draft requests for code review which come with an implied contract that early feedback is welcome, but that I\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s actually ready, and I promise to either make good on that or cancel the request and say why before the end of the quarter.Planning schmanning!replyvegarab 22 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Aside from being open-source, what\u2019s the main differences from https://linear.app/ ?replycolordrops 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]\"aside from being open-source\"...

It is not required to be shared with the upstream project or the world as a whole.

    "content": "Latest Technology Shopify Employee Breaks NDA To Reveal Firm Quietly Replacing Laid Off Workers With AIJuly 20, 2023 10:30 AM ER Velasco 0 Comments artificial intelligence, ShopifyIn a Twitter thread, a Shopify (TSX: SHOP) employee has broken their non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to shed light on the company\u2019s controversial actions and strategic direction. The thread exposed a series of events starting from the first quarter of 2022 when Shopify promised job security to its staff, only to carry out massive layoffs in July of the same year.These job cuts, according to the employee, were driven not merely by a CEO\u2019s misguided \u201cbet,\u201d but rather a shift towards replacing full-time employees with cheaper contract labor and an increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) support.WOW: A @shopify employee is violating their NDA to tell us that @tobi:-has been quietly firing their global customer service team across US, Canada and Ireland-is about to replace them with AI chatbotsGood luck to all Shopify shop owners out there \u2014 shit\u2019s about to SUCK. https://t.co/TwizyV0waP\u2014 Nandini Jammi (@nandoodles) July 19, 2023Last week, Shopify announced its upcoming launch of an artificial intelligence assistant called \u201cSidekick\u201d for merchants using its platform, joining the ranks of other tech companies introducing similar features. In a video shared on Twitter, Lutke demonstrated how the \u201cSidekick\u201d assistant, accessible through a button on Shopify, will be capable of responding to merchant inquiries, providing information on sales trends, and more.The tweet series further detailed how Shopify has been aggressively embracing AI technology, using it for various purposes, from generating product descriptions to creating virtual sidekicks and developing a new help center AI agent still in beta testing. CEO Tobi Lutke\u2019s public statements on Twitter illustrated his belief that companies can achieve higher revenues with fewer employees, signaling a desire to cut costs and please shareholders.However, the consequences of this cost-cutting strategy have negatively impacted customer satisfaction. The reduction in staff and the rise of outsourced, cheap contract labor have led to significant delays in customer support, leaving frustrated merchants waiting for hours or even struggling to receive clear answers. Additionally, teams responsible for monitoring fraudulent stores have been overwhelmed, leading to a potential increase in the number of scam businesses on the platform.5. Tobi has hardly been discreet about his plans, sharing a graph on Twitter that illustrated how, over the years, companies required fewer workers to make $1 million in revenue: https://t.co/WHc8tu3ufx\u2014 Joe Momma (@sh0p1fyj03) July 19, 2023The employee\u2019s Twitter thread also raised concerns about the well-being of Shopify\u2019s workforce. Since the layoffs, remaining staff members have reportedly faced increased workloads without proportional compensation or benefits, leading to burnout, anxiety, and stress leave. Despite these issues being brought to leadership\u2019s attention, they were dismissed as \u201csystem\u201d problems, and the company\u2019s focus on AI-based solutions appeared to supersede the value once placed on human-driven customer service.Furthermore, the thread highlighted Shopify\u2019s apparent shift in target market focus. Previously known for supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, Shopify now seems to prioritize larger players, as its revenue model relies heavily on payment transactions rather than subscription software.The drastic changes in Shopify\u2019s approach have led both employees and customers to question the company\u2019s integrity and commitment to its original mission of empowering small businesses. Many see the company as straying from its roots, becoming more akin to the corporate giants it once aimed to oppose.16. \u201cOnce we know how to fix the system, we will invest heavily in tooling, including tooling to help Support folks do their jobs better and tooling to help our merchants get answers to questions more quickly without having to talk to a human being\u201d.\u2014 Joe Momma (@sh0p1fyj03) July 19, 2023Shopify\u2019s leadership, including President Harley Finkelstein, has assured employees there will be no further layoffs. However, the company\u2019s actions and secretive handling of layoffs under the veil of NDAs have caused employees to doubt these promises.Despite multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year, management compensation at Shopify appears to have been largely unaffected.In a regulatory filing made in May, Shopify revealed that Lutke collected just over $20.0 million in total compensation in 2022, on par with the $20.0 million he collected in 2021, and an increase over the $15.1 million he made in 2020.With public scrutiny growing and concerns over its corporate values and business model mounting, Shopify faces a significant challenge in restoring trust and addressing the impact of its decisions on both employees and customers.Shopify last traded at $89.91 on the TSX.Information for this briefing was found via Twitter and the sources mentioned.

    "content": "ADMINISTRATIONFBI improperly used 702 surveillance powers on US senatorBY REBECCA BEITSCH - 07/21/23 5:25 PM ETSHARETWEETThe FBI improperly used surveillance powers to conduct searches for information on a U.S. senator, a state lawmaker and a state judge, according to court records released Friday as part of a public records request. The FBI\u2019s improper use of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was documented in an opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and is sure to pose challenges for an intelligence community lobbying for the reauthorization for what it sees as one of its most vital tools.The tool \u2013 which allowed for warrantless spying on foreigners located abroad \u2013 has long been criticized as a backdoor tool for gaining information on Americans who may be communicating with those being surveilled.And critics complain the information gathered by the agency through 702 is too easily tapped for investigations with no foreign nexus.The surveillance court outlined three examples of instances where FBI personnel conducted searches of \u201csensitive query terms,\u201d like those of U.S. public officials or candidates, without first seeking approval from the FBI\u2019s deputy director.\u201cIn June 2022, an analyst conducted four queries of Section 702 information using the last names of a U.S. Senator and a state senator, without further limitation,\u201d the opinion states. While the two were believed to be targets of \u201ca specific foreign intelligence service,\u201d the National Security Division at the Department of Justice determined the FBI did not meet the needed standard for running such a query. And in October of that year, \u201ca Staff Operations Specialist ran a query using the Social Security number of a state judge who \u201chad complained to [the] FBI about alleged civil right violations perpetrated by a municipal chief of police.\u201dThe opinion does not make clear the identity of those searched.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), whose efforts prompted the release of the court opinion, highlighted other alarming patterns.\u201cThese disturbing new revelations show how Section 702 surveillance, a spy program the government claims is focused on foreign adversaries, is routinely used against Americans, immigrants, and people who are not accused of any wrongdoing,\u201d Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s National Security Project, said in a statement.\u201cThe FBI continues to break the rules put in place to protect Americans, running illegal searches on public officials including a U.S. senator, and it\u2019s long past time for Congress to step in. As Congress debates reauthorizing Section 702, these opinions make clear why fundamental reforms are urgently needed.\u201dThe FBI and Justice Department in recent weeks have noted the roll out of some FISA reforms \u2013 pointing to a drop in overall queries that involved U.S. citizens.The opinion, originally filed in April, does comment on improvements from the bureau.\u201cDespite the reported errors, there is reason to believe that the FBI has been doing a better job in applying the querying standard,\u201d Judge Rudolph Contreras writes in the opinion.\u201cIn some cases, F.B.I. personnel apparently misapplied the querying standard to a group of similarly situated persons, but those violations do not approach the scale of a number of prior ones.\u201dThe FBI stressed that detail in its response to the opinion\u2019s release.\u201cThe 2023 FISC Opinion confirms the significant improvement in the FBI\u2019s Section 702 querying compliance since the implementation of our substantial reforms,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. \u201cSection 702 is critical in our fight against foreign adversaries.\u202fWe take seriously our role in protecting national security and we take just as seriously our responsibility to be good stewards of our Section 702 authorities. Compliance is an ongoing endeavor, and we\u202frecently announced new additional accountability measures. We will continue to focus on using our Section 702 authorities to protect American lives and keeping our Homeland safe, while safeguarding civil rights and liberties.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time a lawmaker has been improperly searched via FISA 702, with Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) saying in March that his name was searched using the tool.Section 702 is set to expire at the end of the year, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said they will refuse to back its reauthorization without significant reforms.The FBI on Friday sent a letter to House and Senate leaders noting that several different reviews found agents have complied with FISA guidelines at least 98 percent of the time.But in a call with reporters Friday, a senior FBI official said the agency is working on building trust with lawmakers who may feel personally impacted by the issue.\u201cWe are communicating as much as we can to build that level of confidence so that they understand how we are using the tool and how we are holding people accountable for when they are not using the tool correctly. But also to make sure they understand when we do and do not do such things as query members of Congress,\u201d the official said in response to a question from The Hill.\u201cThere was an unacceptably high level of non compliance and various non compliance queering behavior that was going on,\u201d the official added. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very open about [how] we accepted the fact that that was unacceptable. That\u2019s not what we expect from ourselves as an organization.\u201d AMC\u2019s plan to charge more for \u2018preferred\u2019 seats no longer coming to a theater near youTony Bennett: New Yorkers remember singer\u2019s passion for the arts, frequent order at Italian restaurantSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), however, said lawmakers are not assured that intelligence agencies are being fully forthcoming about how they use FISA.\u201cFor years, as government officials have provided misleadingly narrow testimony about who is targeted under Section 702, I have pushed to get the government to come clean. The revelation that 702 is used against \u2018foreign governments and related entities\u2019 directly impacts Americans\u2019 privacy, as American journalists, businesspeople, students and others all have legitimate reason to communicate with foreign governments,\u201d Wyden said in a statement.\u201cThe fact they can be swept up in 702 collection further highlights the need for reforms to protect their privacy.\u201dTAGS DARIN LAHOOD FBI FISCCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

I'm the person who made this thing!Thanks for reading and thanks for all the corrections, in glorious Hacker News fashion. It's definitely a pleasant surprise to see my project here. Putting the \"You\" in CPU is still very much a work in progress \u2014 I was hoping to polish it a lot more and even add some more content before posting on HN later next week :)Some backstory on me: I'm 17 and left high school a year ago to work full-time at Hack Club (https://hackclub.com/). I've been programming for as long as I can remember, and started homeschooling about 6 years ago to focus more on that (and my other interests).Since I'm entirely self-taught, I haven't taken any college systems classes \u2014 and while I had picked up a lot, I wasn't happy with my answer to \"what happens when you run a thing.\" So I let myself spend a shit ton of time actually learning as much as possible. What I found was that:1. Operating systems and hardware are really fun to learn about!2. Wow, online resources on this stuff are terrible.A decent portion of my research ended up at PDFs of lecture slides from 2014, or StackOverflow answers that were, in fact, incorrect or vastly oversimplified.So, I wrote Putting the \"You\" in CPU to hopefully provide a better resource to people who wanted to start teaching themselves all this stuff! While I don't provide perfect coverage (still need to write a couple paragraphs on SMP), it's a lot better than most of what I've seen. I also had fun drawing and making diagrams for the first time, I think I definitely got progressively better and I'm really proud of some of the drawings in the latter few chapters.P.S. The whole thing is open source on GitHub if you want to look under the hood: https://github.com/hackclub/putting-the-you-in-cpureplygary_0 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> Wow, online resources on this stuff are terrible.I've been thinking this a lot lately, searching for things like: a detailed block diagram of the Linux kernel, how page tables work, a comparison of function call ABIs on different platforms, details about low-level network protocols, reserved Linux PID numbers, etc.Occasionally I would find a Reddit thread with an answer, but it was mixed in with the usual Reddit dross, and I doubt that Reddit is a reliable place to store knowledge. StackOverflow was particularly unhelpful, as the questions are mostly oriented around accomplishing particular tasks, and the answers are necessarily brief.Nowadays, for general knowledge, I skip Google's enshittified search and go straight to Wikipedia, but Wikipedia has limits on how much detail it will go into about technical topics.I wonder if there's a need for a comprehensive wiki for all the details of computer guts? There are lots of scattered resources, but having them all compiled in one place would be awesome.replycpach 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]A wiki for operating system internals.

All the way down to the bits living in the CPU registers and going out the PCIe/USB/Ethernet ports.Another thought: a focus on staying up to date would be important. A lot of information about system internals I find is actually historical, and while that's useful sometimes, it's still a pretty big gap. Modern systems are quite poorly documented.replyarchmaster 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Three things -https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page is quite good or at least a starting place. It's very x86-centric, though, and doesn't have a lot of coverage. Also, a decent portion is out of date. I used it a decent amount as at least a component of my research for You in CPU.Agree that modern systems are even more terribly documented than systems in general. So many of the resources I found, even recent ones, were referring to stuff from the original x86 that had long changed. Almost everything I found about ELF or memory layout assumed the memory space was 4 GiB.Finally, I hope Putting the \"You\" in CPU gets well-SEOed if only so people like me Googling for modern answers to these questions will find at least something. I tried to make everything as relevant to modern day tech as possible, and to link to up-to-date resources.replycpach 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]\u201cModern systems are quite poorly documented\u201dHate to say it, but you\u2019re probably very right.replyccrush 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I had the same questions when I was about your age and found a lot of intersting answers in the Linux source code. of course it was a lot simpler back then. what really got me going was the osdev community (much smaller back then) and Intels system architecture documentation. iirc part 3a or 3b was where the good stuff is. it tells you a lot less about how things are and a lot more about how things could be. you also get to learn plenty of fun things in OSDEV too like how 32bit processors did 36bit addressing with PAE or how 64bit processors did 52bit addressing to squeeze money out of people. how computers start in 16bit mode and you have to learn systems level assembly code gymnastics to make it to long mode, why there's an 8bit mode around, and more. if you liked learning about loading binaries, you'll love how many surprises still exist. like 64bit mode still including memory segmentation but forcing it to flat mapping for lonh modereplyBossingAround 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Amazingly impressive!

I suggest slightly revising the end of note #2 for chapter 2 to reflect that some async paradigms in programming languages are cooperatively multitasked. Within a process, it's generally considered safe to utilize cooperative multitasking (desirability is a different question), although I believe Erlang sticks with preemption for robustness.replyWaffleIronMaker 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Heyo, as another teenager who has really enjoyed participating in Hack Club, it's great seeing this work!

However, one thing left me with a question about the kernel:From [0]:> Since shebangs are handled by the kernel, and pull from buf instead of loading the whole file, they\u2019re always truncated to the length of buf. Apparently, 4 years ago, someone got annoyed by the kernel truncating their >128-character paths, and their solution was to double the truncation point by doubling the buffer size! Today, on your very own Linux machine, if you have a shebang line more than 256 characters long, everything past 256 characters will be completely lost.What is the reason for silently truncating someone's filepath? The kernel, of all places, should not be doing such things. Granted, 256-byte long file paths don't make sense, but 256-byte long path+argument strings will almost certainly happen sometimes. To just silently break someone's script is wrong.[0]: https://cpu.land/how-to-run-a-programreplyknome 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]you shouldn't be putting complex arguments in a shebang.it's there to tell where the interpreter for the current file is.shebang can't even handle more than a single argument on its own. if you have `#!/bin/program -args somescript`, it will divide it into ['/bin/program','-args somescript'], which is almost never what you actually wanted. ( this is linux specific, shebangs aren't necessarily universally portable between all unices )if you want to do something complex, make it `#!/bin/sh` and then `exec` from the current file with whatever arguments you need.one thing that link doesn't mention is that you can use env to lookup an interpreter via the current path.`#!/usr/bin/env python3` for example, will find whatever `python3` the users is using, without having to know where it is.this can be useful for scripts that you will be running from virtual environments, for example, which work by overriding the PATH to the python interpreter.you wouldn't want to do this with anything installed, however, since you wouldn't want installed programs to let the user control what interpreter to use. instead, you should just use an absolute path.there is an option in env, -S, that can be used to parse a command line from a single string specifically to handle this limitation.after years of avoiding much trickery in shebang lines, it seems like a questionable practice at best.replyfbdab103 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I have always thought that shebangs are absolute paths to be weird. Everything else in my Linux day to day operates by traversing the PATH, why do shebangs get to be different?replyknome 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]the PATH search is done in userspace by the exec'ing process. the kernel doesn't have or care what the processes' environment PATH says. it just gets the final location.shebang processing is the kernel peeking at the first couple hundred bytes of a file to see if it should execute it using some other file instead of running it directly. there isn't a userspace yet because it's still setting the process up. even if there was a userspace, PATH searching should be done for the `exec`ing process' path, not the PATH given to the new process. so you'd have to squirrel away the calling processes path somewhere on top of everything else.so, it would be a pain. and also incompatible with all of the previous exec system calls, since if you \"fixed\" it to follow the path, anything not expecting that could break.replyarchmaster 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013](Author here:) I strongly agree! It should not require an understanding of the kernel's execution logic to be able to understand the limitations of shebangs. I think this is stupid design and I perhaps should've highlighted it even more as such.A couple years ago someone attempted a patch to the kernel that would at least fail loudly in the case of oversized shebangs. This ended up causing problems for NixOS which, being Nix, already was using oversized shebangs with lots of long nix-store paths. They were previously being silently truncated but still working, and suddenly all those scripts failing caused a lapse in backwards compatibility! So the patch had to be undone and we haven't gotten anything similar since.See https://lwn.net/Articles/779997/ for more info.replyvacuity 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]https://xkcd.com/1172/replyNikkiA 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm more surprised it isn't set to be whatever the disk block size is (which is often, but not always, 512 bytes).replytromp 22 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> For example, add eax, 512 translates to 05 00 02 00 00.> The first byte (05) is an opcode specifically representing adding the EAX register to a 16-bit number.

While I've been working on this project on and off for 3 years it is still in its infancy. I have so many things I want to rewrite, so many features missing even for the most basic game loop. So many 3D models I have to make.And so little time! Working on this as a side project with a full time job has been hard at times. I do not recommend making city builders :DI wish I anticipated the attention so I would have given the README bit more love.Anyway, I will try to answer any questions in the comments.replyjimmySixDOF 3 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Nice !!

I have always liked simulations so I thought: Why not try to simulate what I see? Watching the simulation from above of people going to supermarkets, going to work, trains delivering goods and such. Creating your own city and watching patterns emerge would certainly feels great.A lot like watching little ants going around doing their business. This idea is also explored in one of the books of the Ants trilogy from Bernard Werber (I think?) where a society simulation is used to try out advertising campaigns.replyculopatin 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]What knowledge would you want your partners to have to help you accelerate the project?replyUriopass 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]All aspects of the game need more work, I think anyone that ever worked near the video-game space could help.- 3D assets- Audio assets- UI/UX design- Low-level graphics shenanigans (platform support, debugging tools, dos-and-donts, optimizations)- Simulation depth (logistic chain, economics, city services..)- Mod supportAny help with these would be greatly appreciatedreplydosshell 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What are your thoughts about AI generated 3D assets that many, now startups, promise to sell to indie developers?For me, it sounds like city models such as cars and buildings will be one of the easiest models to generate (from what I have seen in papers).As an indie dev myself I'm counting on that I will be able to buy most 3D content for a fraction of time/cost in a couple of years.

Every successor game and other games seem to either focus on details/individuals or 3D effects with far less scale.We have far more capable hardware to run large cities and more growable lots and better traffic pattern.

I like cities skylines but I prefer the simulation aspect to the gamified aspect.replyretrac 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]You may like Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic. [1] Fair warning: it has a rather brutal learning curve. It's somewhere between Factorio, Simcity and OpenTTD.To build an apartment building, you need prefab panels. To get panels, you need to build a panel factory, which needs gravel. To get gravel, you need a quarry. And then you need vehicles to haul the gravel to the panel factory. And then the panels to the construction site. And buses to bring workers from another housing block to the construction site. And you need to import or produce fuel, and electricity, to run all of it. (Or you can just spend some currency you've earned from exports to build it or import it instantly. Necessary at the start to get your nucleus of industry going.)It's almost ready for official 1.0 release later this year, and has excellent mod support for custom buildings/industries.[1] https://store.steampowered.com/app/784150/Workers__Resources...replybillfruit 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What about construction times? Is it something resembling real world time lines?replyretrac 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Construction cost is materials + labour hours. If you put a building in a built-up populated area, stocked with construction vehicles and materials, it'll go up in a matter of days or weeks, simulated time. If you place it way out in the boondocks with one mud road there, it might take years of simulated time. In that regard it feels very \"realistic\".replyPannoniae 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah. Cities: Skylines just feels so soulless to me. It's like me looking at a model railway - it might look cute but it's just dead. The game is effectively a traffic simulator, with citizens not really having agency (beyond the Chirper which most people are annoyed by), and next to zero economic management. No mixed zoning or organic growth, you effectively run a completely planned economy. There's not much external trade or a real economy which needs all sorts of skills to function. It feels really eery and creepy to me.replyripperdoc 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Upcoming Citities Skylines 2 seems to have improved a lot on the simulation parts. Removing \"pocket cars\", giving more agency to agents, more types of zoning, hopefully more challenging economy, trading of resources with external cities, etc. So at least I'm hyped about it!replydalmo3 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You perfectly describe my sentiment every time I try playing CS. No matter how gorgeous it looks at some point it just strikes as hollow and disengaging.replyorost 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The simulation is just so fake, almost everything that goes on is just decorative.There is a budget, but after the first 30 minutes you'll always be running an enormous surplus without trying.Citizen commute to work, but if they can't get there, the workplaces will continue to work, with some trivial penalty to efficiency.There is traffic simulation, but if a jam forms, vehicles will start vanishing to unblock the road.You can build public transport, but it doesn't matter if it's efficient, because the city's entire population can be standing at bus stops waiting forever with seemingly no ill effect.Citizens will use parking spots if they're available, but if they aren't, they'll just disappear their car and reappear it later.Zoned buildings get built and upgraded autonomously, but what gets built doesn't depend on economic factors, just on how many upgrade points are accrued from nearby services and attractions.There is a large number of special buildings of various types that can be unlocked and built, but they all count as a tourist attraction and don't perform their actual function, they're effectively statues.Cities Skylines is a bizarre un-game that has all the UX and presentation of a city simulator without any actual simulation.replyPannoniae 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]<3 I feel this way with many other simulators.... They try so hard to have many things but there's zero element of \"is this fun\" and plain quirkiness. Good old Sid Meier's Pirates has more fun than playing these soulless games:(The most recent example is KSP2 - they unironically have degraded the physics engine on purpose because the lead designer thought that wobbly rockets were fun. I think that person has never played KSP1, KSP2 is simply another soulless game with small injections of carefully controlled-dosage \"fun\".replybombcar 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The train simulators that have city building as an afterthought often feel much more like a game than the city builders; probably because you have external forces acting on you and driving your decisionsreplyitsmartapuntocm 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The goofy aspects of Simcity like the animated advisors and the music really made it feel alive. It\u2019s why I still prefer the old ones to CS.replybobthepanda 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The sequel, from what it seems like, is focused on zoning and growth via land values, and does feature some kind of trading mechanic, though I guess the real proof is when it comes out.The question that is hard to balance in sims like this is how do you make something like this a fun game. it's a pretty tricky balance.replykaffeeringe 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I wish, it was possible to build a city that is not car-centric.replyaylmao 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The simulation is probably not as accurate as modern city-builders, but this is one of the reasons SimCity 4000 Rush Hour is still my favourite game in the genre.Roads and cars still form a core part of the game, it doesn't support pedestrian-only streets or bikes, but density is so much easier to achieve. That + the grid means cities don't end up looking \"suburban\" and \"car-centric\".replyUriopass 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It is definitely my ambition to implement public transportation but it is much harder to implement than cars. I live in Paris so I know what a non-car-centric city looks like and all the complexities around it (not to say I don't like it!).With cars, anyone can go anywhere without thinking much, although it is a bit of an overstatement considering the time I have spent fighting gridlocks.replyAlecSchueler 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]We need City Builder Netherlands.replyGenerocUsername 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Try Banished.It's like 10 years old, but kind of scratches that simple old lifestyle itch without any war or fighting elementsreplyAlecSchueler 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm looking for something post-auto, not pre-auto.

A lot of the underlying simulation is also 2D as I didn't port everything when doing the migration.From the player perspective, 3D is the norm these days. It looks better, it's usually more intuitive and 2D is usually a bunch of tricks to fake 3D anyway.From a developer perspective, 3D fits my brain better as I can translate real concepts better. To me, it feels easier modelling in blender and apply physically based rendering rather than learning lots of 2D techniques to have a consistent good looking art style.replythelazyone 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Aesthetically I can totally see how a 2D visualization could look great.

It\u2019s actually when a disc, usually near the base of the spine, develops a bulge which sticks out and presses against the spinal nerve. It\u2019s as painful as it sounds (and then some!), and also causes tingling and pain in the legs too. At times it\u2019s made me unable to move and unable to sleep. Recovery takes weeks or months, although surgery is also an option.It could happen to any of us if we develop unhealthy habits when programming, with the strain on our backs building up over time. And so, fellow keyboard warrior, here are some steps I encourage you to take to avoid this pain.Daily stretchesAccording to my osteopath*, sitting for long periods of time had led to my stomach and thigh muscles being relatively unused, and therefore unable to assist my back in supporting my body, putting it under extra strain. Although strength-building exercises would be best, just doing daily central and lower body stretches would have a positive effect. The muscles would be more supple and more able to help support the body.You don\u2019t have to suddenly become a yoga fanatic (although you can if you want!). Just regular stretches in the morning or after a hot bath in the evening, when the body is relaxed, should make a big difference.Take regular breaksThis is so simple but so important \u2013 at least once an hour get up and take a short walk or some other non-screen activity. Not only is this an easy way to look after your body, I\u2019ve often found that it helps with coding too. So many times I\u2019ve been stuck on a problem, done something completely different, and then come back to the problem with an idea of something new to try.I feel like this is something we all know we should do, but often hard to put into practice. Time to make it a habit!Don\u2019t code late at nightI think we\u2019re all guilty of this, sometimes even turning it into a boast \u2013 \u201cI pulled an all-nighter!\u201d Surely it\u2019s time we change this attitude. Our code is worse, even harmful, when we\u2019re really tired, and we naturally concentrate less on our posture leading to being hunched over the keyboard for hours. Please set a time past which you will switch off, mentally and physically, and be strict with it.Improve your coding environmentI have a laptop stand and ergonomic chair, both of which make sitting at my desk much more comfortable, but even with those I still ending up suffering with back pain. I\u2019ve heard so many recommendations for a standing desk that at last, I\u2019m making the switch.Currently I just have a temporary setup of a small table on top of my desk, but already I can feel I move around more than when I sit, without really feeling more tired. It also naturally leads to taking more breaks so it\u2019s a 2-in-1 habit!I don\u2019t know why it took me so long to realise the importance of this and all the other habits, and I wish I\u2019d fixed my ways earlier. Now I\u2019ve paid the price but hopefully it\u2019s not too late for you, especially if you\u2019re in the early stages of your career.Please learn from my mistakes and enjoy many happy years of healthy coding!* I previously wrote \u201cchiropractor\u201d here but have changed it to \u201costeopath\u201d. I live in Japan so I didn\u2019t know the English name but the place I go to is a \u63a5\u9aa8\u9662, which I think is probably an osteopath but I\u2019m not 100% sure.** There\u2019s an interesting discussion of this post on Hacker News, with more tips and suggestions by commenters.Share this:TwitterFacebookLoading\u2026Generaladvice, health, programming, tipsPosted by:daniemon\u00ab Previous Post5 responses to \u201cThe Most Important Coding Habits\u201d\u6700\u3082\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u7fd2\u6163 \u2013 \u4e16\u754c\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u3092\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3067\u30b6\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\u78ba\u8a8d\uff01July 23, 2023 at 3:10 am[\u2026] \u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u306fHackerNews\u306b\u63b2\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4e0b\u8a18\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u304a\u3088\u3073\u305d\u308c\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308bHackerNews\u4e0a\u306e\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5143\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002The Most Important Coding Habits [\u2026]LikeReplyThe Most Important Coding Habits \u2013 Veritas ReportersJuly 23, 2023 at 3:10 am[\u2026] Read More [\u2026]LikeReplyThe Most Essential Coding Habits \u2013 TOP HACKER\u2122July 23, 2023 at 4:46 am[\u2026] Read More [\u2026]LikeReplyCrucial Coding Habits \u2013 TOP HACKER\u2122July 23, 2023 at 6:36 am[\u2026] Read More [\u2026]LikeReplyImportant Coding Habits by tagawa \u2013 HackTechJuly 23, 2023 at 11:37 am[\u2026] Read More [\u2026]LikeReplyLeave a ReplySearchSEARCHRECENT POSTSThe Most Important Coding HabitsHow to print ChatGPT API response as a streamHow to Get a JSON Object From ChatGPT Using Function CallingHow to Hide API Keys When Deploying CodeThe Simplest Way to Use ChatGPT with Pythonadvice AI API books ChatGPT deploy example free GitHub health Heroku howto JSON OpenAI programming Python safety server tipsNEWSLETTERSUBSCRIBERECENT POSTSThe Most Important Coding HabitsHow to print ChatGPT API response as a streamHow to Get a JSON Object From ChatGPT Using Function CallingFOLLOW METwitterYouTubeNEWSLETTERSUBSCRIBE\u00a9PuppyCoding2023, All Rights Reserved.Blog at WordPress.com.Follow",

Learning this stuff isn't technical knowledge, it's product knowledge.I read the TCP/IP illustrated series cover to cover and learned that stuff cold, and this was useful knowledge to me for decades.However I always find myself resisting learning this AWS stuff, which is just as complex in its own way too. This diagram makes me feel that if the goal was to simplify things, then I'm not sure how successful they were at that.replyalex-mohr 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> if the goal was to simplify things, then I'm not sure how successful they were at that.Maybe if they have other goals that are tradeoffs vs. simplicity, then it's more understandable?What if another goal is allowing enterprise customers to recreate a virtual enterprise network? Or a virtual data center network? Those are much more complex than a client TCP stack.The defaults are simple for simple uses. And yes, for those complex cases, you'd need AWS specific product knowledge, but most of the underlying concepts are shared in common with other clouds and on prem networks. Like learning your Nth programming language.replysaurik 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]AWS used to be not only sane but elegant: every instance had an entirely-arbitrary internal/private IP address, some could optionally have a second public address, and which instances (including external IP addresses) could talk to which other instances was entirely and solely defined by security groups (as well as, of course, any OS-level firewalls that you'd generally disable), which were pretty much just flexible and reusable firewall rules where the concept of a \"security group\" replaced entirely the concept of a \"subnet\", which became an obsolete legacy concept.They needed to support multiple adapters per instance, which they later added (maybe with a separate security group per adapter, which they might support now but I don't know off-hand); and they also needed hierarchical security group inheritance (the same way traditional subnets can nest into each other), which they didn't add but I guess you can now simulate them (though this sucks and I think is part of the downfall of the elegant stack) using multiple non-hierarchical security groups (which was not supported originally: security groups were permanently fixed in a one-to-one relationship with an instance).This original elegant cloud-first model of instances and groups made network engineering pleasant for once... even fun! I remember thinking how great it was that all of my arcane physical networking and routing knowledge might soon be obsolete: that I could now think in terms of the abstractions of instances and how they talk to each other, drawing abstract circles around them without having to think about limited address spaces, and that they would assuredly fix the only two shortcomings of the original model......but then the network engineers showed up in force and ruined it all. There is simply no good reason for all of this VPC IP-address subnet focused insanity once you go cloud: they are just re-instating all of the frustrating limitations that come up when doing real world network engineering, presumably because they weren't willing to throw away their knowledge and realize all of that stuff is obsolete.Like, seriously: we want to be able to replicate some enterprise network? That's madness, and it makes it all worse for everyone that this is even a supported goal. This is all virtualized networking: we don't need to be thinking in terms of subnets and gateways, we don't need to be manually configuring our egress... if you have a ton of hubs and routers and have to run cable all over the place, it makes sense, but this is the cloud!And so now we all actually had to brush off all of that networking knowledge I was happy to give up as Amazon deprecated and fully removed \"EC2 Classic\" and have forced us all into this VPC insanity; and maybe if you never really tried to grok how AWS worked 15 years ago when it wasn't pretending to be a pile of legacy networking equipment you just shrug and accept that this somehow is all necessary, but it really isn't.replymarcus0x62 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]>...but then the network engineers showed up in force and ruined it all.I've never met a single network engineer who had anything good to say about any of the cloud networking environments. I have met a bunch of network engineers who were told by management \"go recreate our data center network in the 'cloud'. We're moving everything there over the next 18 months. No, we aren't going to re-factor any of our apps in the process.\"That's why all these kludges exist in AWS and other public cloud environments.replyecshafer 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]On the flip side, the unnecessary AWS complexity is a great make work program for developers. You now need an army of developers (and AWS \"architects\") to make a truly complex behemoth that fully replicates the insanity of a 50 year old enterprise system. A system of such complexity no single person can understand it all, all changes take days to weeks to make, and its behind black boxes everywhere. That's progress.replyirrational 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I thought the other goal was to make it easy to get in but very difficult to leave so you are practically forced to keep using their services. Customer capture.replydeathanatos 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Learning this stuff isn't technical knowledge, it's product knowledge.Not really, and mostly I think you're looking at it through the lens of a different field. TCP/IP is going to be the knowledge useful to your network programmer. One of my college courses was networking: we covered networks, subnets, route tables, routing protocols (such as RIP, OSPF, BGP), NAT, etc. We did all this on actual hardware, and the course was heavily sponsored by Cisco (so much that by the end of the semester, you were CCNA certified). In that vein, yes, I picked up a lot of \"product knowledge\" on how Cisco products behave, 95% of which I've probably forgotten. But that was to give us hands on experience, and the underlying concepts translate well into Azure, AWS, or GCP. These cloud VPCs are mostly virtual analogs to the real deal, much like how VMs are analogs to a real machine. If you understand a real machine, a VM (and associated resources like cloud disks or NICs) aren't going to be that mysterious.In particular, NAT confuses the living daylights out of people. But, that's almost to be expected. More down to earth, many eng struggle with CIDR notation, or even \u2014 but this gets back to your stuff \u2014 TCP (e.g., they think that a send() will send the passed buffer as a unit, or that a recv() will always receive a full \"message\" of some sort; most eng struggle to understand the difference between connection timeouts and peer resets, and when one can happen and the other cannot).The dark side of this coin is that I really wish I didn't need a lot of this knowledge; it is a lot of junk. IPv6 makes networks so big that a lot of network planning and subnet sizing and \"will it have enough room to grow but also not exhaust the range?\" just goes away. NAT can die in a cold icy hell. If I could never see another VPN in my life, that'd be cool. (Just use TLS, for the love of everything dear.) I could also do away with cloud firewalls using IP addresses as a form of auth, and delivering misleading errors when triggered. (Azure is horrid at this.)(I do hope that most products are technically simple enough to not need much of this knowledge. If you do TLS, you shouldn't need to be doing VPCs, non-default route tables, network peering, etc. I'm in a field where we integrate with a lot of people who have no desire for technical simplicity.)replyoaiey 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I share this perspective. Most boxes in this diagram are AWS names for a thing existing in normal datacenter or TCP/IP networking. I am an old schooler who personally never worked a lot with AWS, but I think this is pretty clean.replydasil003 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think it's a boiling frog scenario. AWS's goal is marketshare, not simplicity. Like many professional software products, it started simple by necessity and then grew more complex over time. In AWS's case it ballooned pretty quickly due to the compelling nature of fully-managed on-demand infra services and the huge amount of resources Amazon poured into it.The value add for not having to directly interact with hardware is still pretty high, but you definitely pay a price (in addition to the sticker price) for it in terms non-transferable vendor-specific knowledge.replyicedchai 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yep, it would be nice if they had used standard terminology. Example: a \"virtual router\" that you could configure (with internet, NAT, connections to other VPCs, firewall rules, etc.) Instead, you have all sorts of one offs: \"internet gateways\", \"NAT gateways\", \"egress only internet gateways\", \"transit gateways.\" We're going to wind up with a whole generation of engineers that only understand \"cloud\" and not how things actually work.replysmcleod 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yep, welcome to the cloud (and SaaS in general).The big 3 work very hard to make sure you\u2019re learning their product so you can advocate for it (because it\u2019s what you now live and breathe) and sell it to others.Who needs a marketing team when you\u2019re making everyone a \u201ctech evangelist\u201d for your product.replyqwertyuiop_ 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Undifferentiated heavy lifting. Companies don't have to train their engineers and find talent that requires deep knowledge of tcp/ip and hardware routers and clean up the mess when they leave and maintain them. Offload all of the \"undifferentiated\" components to AWS and you focus on what you are good at, your business.replynprateem 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Why is debugging IAM policies and auth issues such complete dogshit on AWS? Seriously, if you want to be a competitor, focus on this.I've wasted hours trying to work out why I get an unauthorised error, and the official docs say to manually pick your way through the 8 or so different policies that might apply (SCPs, IAM, resource policies, etc). Yeah right.When you eventually find the page showing how to use Athena with Cloudtrail, you discover half the requests are inexplicably missing. And even though error messages include a request ID, you can't easily query for them, if it's even possible. Maybe it is and I just haven't discovered the right athena incantation. They should make it easy to just query by request ID and get clear messages telling you what policy denied the request.It's a total train wreck from start to finish. I guess by keeping such a shitshow they sell more support contracts though.replybenterix 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]A cynic in me is happy about this state of affairs - the companies who happily joined the AWS bandwagon have to pay the price (including my salary). For my projects I almost always choose something else that offers better value, except in very rare cases when it makes sense.A decade ago or so AWS was marketed as - to simplify - \"fire all your sysadmins because we manage the systems for you\" to the current state where good AWS DevOps engineers are expensive and not so easy to find and you pay through the nose if you really follow AWS recommendations, especially for larger setups.replynprateem 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Pretty tedious work though. I'd far rather feel I was actually doing useful work instead of dealing with this stupid crap.replysteveBK123 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah this has been my observation.CTOs bought the \"fire all your sysadmins\" literally, and now we have a 20% overhead on all app devs who are supposed to learn all this stuff.It's crazy to me. It's literally the opposite of every management training / book about focussing on highest value work / where you add value / where you provide expertise.replyrenegade-otter 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]20%? Seems like at least half of all the work has to do with infrastructure plumbing, now that people who are supposed to write product code are expected to be Cloud prodigies.replyecshafer 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]When I was at a company that went all in on AWS. I went from 100% of time working on product, to easy 75% of time working on AWS. Even though we had teams who just set up infra on aws for us to use and it was supposed to be \"so easy\". There was far more time setting up AWS infra than writing code.replysteveBK123 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, and management discounts that .. if you make me, a product expert, working on application software.. deal with this stuff, I am going to do the worst, most rapid, half-assed, security and everything else be damned job.I have clients, product, scrum masters, tech leads, and others breathing down my neck on feature delivery, and you're asking me to figure this alphabet soup out, lol.. don't expect happy results dudes.I've been a domain expert in a field for 20 years, what value do I bring to the client in dealing with this alphabet soup of AWS networking/security? Either it works and client gets what they want, or it doesn't and they don't.This stuff is a full time job and should be respected as such. If you think you can push it all down on app dev, you are going to have unhappy results.replyhooverd 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I hate CloudFormation I hate CloudFormation.Unless you're using AWS as yet another VPS provider, creating a \"cloudy\" product requires way too much knowledge about AWS services as a developer.replyanyoneamous 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I never saw it marketed that way - but even so, anyone stupid enough to fall for it deserves every NAT gateway charge they've had since.reply2-718-281-828 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]would you mind elaborating on the nat gateway part? are you insinuating that nat gateway as mean to provide oneway internet access for instances in private subnets are misguided or suboptimal?replyhooverd 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Managed NAT Gateways are one of the more expensive services in the known universe.reply2-718-281-828 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]what would you use instead?replybenterix 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]AWS NAT Gateway pricing is so outrageous that smart people came up with a peculiar hybrid:https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/an-alternat-future-we-now...I wouldn't use it in production (some companies do, for internal things) but the very fact it exists speaks volumes.replyberkle4455 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]a tiny ec2 box that provides NAT for about $3/mo.replybob1029 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Why is debugging IAM policies and auth issues such complete dogshit on AWS? Seriously, if you want to be a competitor, focus on this.System managed identities + AAD is an absolute joy in my experience on Azure. I can grant a function app access to a SQL database by simply using the literal name of the function app (qualified by the object's identifier if aliased). No passwords, certificates, etc. involved anymore. It literally just works.Combine their auth package with things like application insights, and you are not really ever stuck thinking \"WTF happened\", assuming you have enough awareness to look at those logs.> I guess by keeping such a shitshow they sell more support contracts though.This is also a problem with Azure. You really have to know where all of the mines are located before you start walking through their field or you will wind up in a similar state of contorted frustration. I'd argue that Microsoft leaves substantially better hints regarding where mines might be, but they still conveniently leave out enough hints such that only a wizard with 2 decades of experience can pierce the final veil of bullshit and avoid a 5-10x multiple on cost & complexity.replyjiggawatts 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It literally just worksIn only a few toy scenarios!For example:Azure SQL Database, Managed Instance, and SQL 2022 in a VM all support AAD authentication.Okay.SQL 2022 supports only user accounts and not managed identities.SQL Managed Instance requires an additional global AAD permission button to be pressed post-deployment or it won\u2019t work. This can\u2019t be templated.The first two have AAD permissions controlled via their template (ARM API) \u2014 but only exactly one full admin group. All other permissions must be assigned via T-SQL. Again, can\u2019t be templated via ARM. (Microsoft has better data plane RBAC for random open source products than their own flagship database!)User access audit logs are easily collected for Azure SQL Database, needs manual T-SQL for SQL MI and is missing in action for SQL Server.This is just SQL, which now at least supports user-assigned managed identities\u2026 if you include the latest SQL client which has a breaking namespace change and hence won\u2019t work with third-party code. It also drags in 500 MB of dependencies.Lightweight functions, you were saying? Hmmm\u2026Anyway, I got fed up with the whole thing when I tried hooking up a Storage Account in the same way and discovered that it didn\u2019t support UMSI in connection strings \u2014 you need two code paths for dev-time and runtime!Up until recently the whole thing was an unstable mess. Authentication would take 5 seconds in some scenarios and then wouldn\u2019t cache the tickets properly.It turns out that every Azure team is implementing the whole thing separately! It\u2019s not at all like traditional AD where the platform provides the authentication functions in a uniform way and apps can just pick up the ambient tokens.No, in this shiny new world every service does RBAC differently, connection strings differently, auditing differently, caching, config, and on and on.All of this within 100% Microsoft products and services.It\u2019s a poorly thought out mess.replybob1029 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> In only a few toy scenarios!I am not sure I understand. The \"toys\" you describe are all we need to get the job done. Azure SQL Hyperscale, Azure Functions C#/v4, AAD, another region for DR (SQL geo replica + Function App x2) and that's about it... Why do we want to make this hard?If you want to try to force the square peg through the round hole, I get it. It's going to be a clusterfuck as you describe. But, I decided we were going to get completely trashed on the Microsoft kool-aid so we don't have to worry about 3rd party clients and other non-happy-path integrations. I click 1 big dumb button in my Visual Studio client and some time later my app is running on a live URL completely managed by Microsoft. This is a pretty good life.

Just turn on the firewall... and oh boy...You can whitelist only subnets. Individual subnets. One. At. A. Time. Not virtual networks. Definitely not \"all\" of your virtual networks, which works elsewhere perfectly fine.Okay, fine, there's a Private Endpoint feature as well. Sure, it kills performance and costs extra, but there's nothing wrong with having this cost money, right? After all, flipping the address in some config of a software-defined-network (SDN) from \"public\" to \"private\" is hard work and the gremlins in the cloud need to be compensated.Then, err... uh-oh. It doesn't actually work! You need to override DNS to make your clients discover it. So you plug it into your AD domain. Now your PaaS services can't access it.Okay fine, you create a private DNS zone (which costs more money), link it to a hub network, link a DNS Resolver service to it (which costs more money), then set up a bazillion rules so that your AD domain still works, and then...... where was I again? I started this a week ago.Oh yeah, I just wanted to make sure Russian hackers can't access our backups if a storage key leaks.Maybe next week I can update the subscription templates to re-deploy all the virtual networks with the updated DNS settings.Not idempotent, you say?

It\u2019s just that now developers are more exposed to the insane mess that is enterprise networking where before it was strictly an ops thing. It\u2019s still mainly an ops thing, which is why I called the DNS setup magic because that\u2019s the part of it I don\u2019t ever touch.

Then when you need to do something on the internet, you\u2019d need to open up. You\u2019re likely going to need to set up a bunch of things like load balancer a and what not anyway, so the process of putting something on the internet is complicated to begin with, but everything should just be off the internet by default. At least as some Enterprise setting or whatever.But I guess part of it is that Microsoft sells Azure certifications and need it to be hard.

Want to trust a foreign tenant? Add their single /48 prefix and done! No NAT!Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints are required only because IPv6 RFC1918 private ranges are too small, and hence overlap between customers. Remove the overlap and you remove the need for any kind of tunnelling or SDN magic.No more split DNS either: the AAAA records are always the same for every name, whether \"inside\" or \"outside\" the network. At most, you might need \"private records\" that resolve only if the request query comes from the customer's /48 prefix.And on and on...IPv4 ought to have been an optional compatibility add-on, a side show to secure-by-default IPv6.[1] Sadly, there's still software being written today that doesn't work with IPv6.replyjorams 23 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is very cool.

    "content": "Microsoft and CISA recently disclosed a security incident impacting multiple customers of Exchange Online and Outlook.com. According to Microsoft, this incident stemmed from a threat actor attributed to China, Storm-0558, acquiring a private encryption key (MSA key) and using it to forge access tokens for Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com. Additionally, the threat actor reportedly exploited two security issues in Microsoft\u2019s token verification process.Microsoft have said that Outlook.com and Exchange Online were the only applications known to have been affected via the token forging technique, but Wiz Research has found that the compromised signing key was more powerful than it may have seemed, and was not limited to just those two services. Our researchers concluded that the compromised MSA key could have allowed the threat actor to forge access tokens for multiple types of Azure Active Directory applications, including every application that supports personal account authentication, such as SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, customers\u2019 applications that support the \u201clogin with Microsoft\u201d functionality, and multi-tenant applications in certain conditions.In addition, while Microsoft mitigated this risk by revoking the impacted encryption key and publishing attacker IOCs, we discovered that it may be difficult for customers to detect the use of forged tokens against their applications due to lack of logs on crucial fields related to the token verification process.Why is it so impactful? Identity provider\u2019s signing keys are probably the most powerful secrets in the modern world. For example, they are much more powerful than TLS keys. Even if an attacker got access to the google.com TLS key, they would still need to somehow impersonate a google.com server to gain significant impact. With identity provider keys, one can gain immediate single hop access to everything, any email box, file service or cloud account. This isn\u2019t a Microsoft specific issue, if a signing key for Google, Facebook, Okta or any other major identity provider leaks, the implications are hard to comprehend. Our industry \u2013 and especially cloud service providers \u2013 must commit to a greater level of security and transparency concerning how they protect critical keys such as this one, to prevent future incidents and limit their potential impact. In this post, we will share how we were able to confirm which private key was acquired by the threat actor and how we determined its permissions. We will also unpack some of the technical aspects of this incident and help detect potential use of this compromised key within your environments.Compromised consumer signing key \u2013 who are you? On July 11th, 2023, Microsoft revealed that a malicious actor had obtained an MSA consumer signing key, allowing them to forge access tokens for Exchange Online and Outlook.com accounts.Determined to learn more about the incident, we launched an investigation.First, we checked which keys could sign OpenID tokens for Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory applications. We therefore examined Microsoft\u2019s official documentation for OpenID token verification. Interestingly, we discovered that all Azure personal account v2.0 applications depend on a list of 8 public keys, and all Azure multi-tenant v2.0 applications with Microsoft account enabled depend on a list of 7 public keys (at the time of writing).Using the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, we noticed that one of the listed public keys that had been present since at least 2016 was replaced sometime between June 27th and July 5th, 2023, matching the time frame in which Microsoft replaced the acquired key according to their blog post.{  \"kty\":\"RSA\",  \"use\":\"sig\",  \"kid\":\"1LTMzakihiRla_8z2BEJVXeWMqo\",  \"x5t\":\"1LTMzakihiRla_8z2BEJVXeWMqo\",  \"n\":\"3sKcJSD4cHwTY5jYm5lNEzqk3wON1CaARO5EoWIQt5u-X-\u2026\",  \"e\":\"AQAB\",  \"x5c\":[ \"MIIDYDCCAkigAwIBAgIJAIB4jVVJ3BeuMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUA\u2026\"  ],  \"issuer\":\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad/v2.0\" } Metadata of the public key replaced between June 27th and July 5th The old public key\u2019s certificate revealed it was issued on April 5th, 2016, and expired on April 4th, 2021, and its thumbprint matched the thumbprint of the key Microsoft listed in their latest blog post, named \u201cThumbprint of acquired signing key\u201d:The decoded certificate of the old key (1LTMzakihiRla_8z2BEJVXeWMqo). Obtained from the list intended June 27th, 2023 version of the certificate list for Azure common (mixed audience) applications.This led us to believe that although the compromised key acquired by Storm-0558 was a private key designed for Microsoft's MSA tenant in Azure, it was also able to sign OpenID v2.0 tokens for multiple types of Azure Active Directory applications.What is the significance of a compromised OpenID signing key? The Azure identity platform publishes multiple lists of trusted keys scoped to different application types. These serve to validate the integrity of tokens which are issued by Azure Active Directory (AAD). During the authentication process for an AAD application, the application must confirm the token's authenticity by verifying its signature against the correct trusted public key list. This verification determines whether the token should be trusted.# Azure Active Directory multi-tenant applications: https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/discovery/v2.0/keys # Azure Active Directory Multi-Tenant & Personal Account Applications (mixed audience): https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keyshttps://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys # Azure Active Directory Personal Account (MSA) Applications: https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/discovery/v2.0/keyshttps://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/discovery/v2.0/keyshttps://login.microsoftonline.com/9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad/discovery/v2.0/keyshttps://login.microsoftonline.com/9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad/discovery/v2.0/keys# Azure Active Directory Single-Tenant Applications: https://login.microsoftonline.com/${tenantId}/discovery/v2.0/keys https://login.microsoftonline.com/${tenantId}/discovery/v2.0/keys?appid=${AppId} Azure Active Directory public certificates\u2019 lists If any of the keys from one of these lists are compromised, there is a significant risk for applications using that list for validation. Such a compromise could enable unauthorized parties to forge valid access tokens for consumption by any application that depends on the Azure identity platform under certain conditions (see below).The risks of compromised OpenID signing keyBased on what we can deduce from Microsoft\u2019s blog post, Storm-0558 seemingly managed to obtain access to one of several keys that were intended for signing and verifying AAD access tokens. The compromised key was trusted to sign any OpenID v2.0 access token for personal accounts and mixed-audience (multi-tenant or personal account) AAD applications.The types of applications that could trust the key acquired by Storm-0558In other words, Storm-0558 could have theoretically used the private key it acquired to forge tokens to authenticate as any user to any affected application that trusts Microsoft OpenID v2.0 mixed audience and personal-accounts certificates.Which applications are affected? Based on our analysis, only Azure Active Directory applications that work with Microsoft\u2019s OpenID v2.0 were affected. Version 1.0 applications were not using the compromised key for token validation and therefore were not affected.Applications supporting Personal Microsoft accounts onlyAny Azure Active Directory application that supports \u201cPersonal Microsoft accounts only\u201d and works against Microsoft\u2019s v2.0 protocol was affected. This includes managed Microsoft applications, such as Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams, as well as customers\u2019 applications that support Microsoft Account authentication, including those who allow the \u201cLogin with Microsoft\u201d functionality.Applications supporting accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory \u2013 Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)Any Azure Active Directory application that supported \u201cmixed audience\u201d and works against Microsoft\u2019s v2.0 protocol was affected as well. The threat actor could forge valid access tokens and impersonate application users who signed in with their Personal Microsoft account.To restrict the power of MSA keys in impersonating organizational accounts, Microsoft introduced an extension to the OpenID protocol. This extension advises developers to validate the issuer claim by comparing it with the issuer field in the list of the OpenID public keys. By doing this, it aims to prevent an MSA key from signing access tokens with an issuer different than the MSA tenant (9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad). This extension is specific to Microsoft and the responsibility of its implementation rests with the application owner. Therefore, there is a concern that many applications lack this procedure and as a result, the threat actor could potentially impersonate organizational accounts as well (according to Microsoft\u2019s blogpost, OWA was affected by a similar issue).To assist Azure developers with adopting this validation functionality, Microsoft added it to their official Azure SDK on July 12.Applications supporting accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory \u2013 Multi-tenant)IIf the multi-tenant application is configured to rely on the \u201ccommon\u201d v2.0 keys endpoint (instead of \u201cOrganizations\u201d), then it is affected but also should be considered misconfigured. The official Microsoft documentation is not clear on when the \u201ccommon\u201d endpoint should be used, and therefore, some multi-tenant applications could be affected as well.Applications supporting accounts in this organizational directory only (Singletenant)Single tenant applications were not affected. How different types of users may have been affected depending on the application type and whether it was properly validating access tokensHow does key forging work? OpenID keys are fundamentally JWTs signed by an authorized private key. As part of the Azure Active Directory token validation procedure, the app developer must confirm that the key is indeed signed by the relevant authority for the intended scope, and that the token's aud field matches the targeted application\u2019s scope.To confirm whether the token was truly signed by a trusted Azure authority, the application developer queries a metadata endpoint (named jwks_uri) to pull the permitted certificates for signature verification and verify the token against it.To forge a valid access token, the threat actor could have crafted a JWT token, populated it with a victim\u2019s data (e.g. email address), and finally signed it with the trusted compromised key that is listed under the Azure Active Directory public certificates\u2019 endpoint. By submitting the signed token to a targeted application, the malicious actor could have then impersonated the victim.Here is a fictitious example of such a forged OpenID token signed by the compromised encryption key, 1LTMzakihiRla_8z2BEJVXeWMqo:According to Microsoft's guidelines, in order for the token to be considered valid, the issuer claim (iss) must be set to https: //sts.windows.net/9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad/v2.0 since it was specified in the issuer field within the jwks_uri endpoint. As for the tenant ID claim (tid), it must accordingly be set to 9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad, the MSA tenant\u2019s ID.For AAD mixed-audience applications (multi-tenant and personal-account), any token signed by the MSA tenant for an Azure AD account could be deemed valid, as long as it impersonates a personal account.For additional details, check out Microsoft's official guidelines on how to verify ID Tokens.Are Azure customers still at risk? Due to Microsoft's revocation of the compromised key, Azure Active Directory applications will no longer accept forged tokens as valid tokens. Tokens with extended expiration dates will also be rejected by these applications.However, during previously established sessions with customer applications prior to the revocation, the malicious actor could have leveraged its access to establish persistence. This could have occurred by leveraging the obtained application permissions to issue application-specific access keys or setting up application-specific backdoors. A notable example of this is how, prior to Microsoft\u2019s mitigation, Storm-0558 issued valid Exchange Online access tokens by forging access tokens for Outlook Web Access (OWA).There is another potential risk to applications that retained copies of the AAD public keys prior to Microsoft's certificate revocation. Applications that rely on local certificate stores or cached keys and still trust the compromised key remain susceptible to token forgery. It is imperative for these applications to immediately refresh the list of trusted certificates. Microsoft advises refreshing the cache of local stores and certificates at least once a day.Recommendations for Azure users To identify whether a compromised key was used in your environment, identify all potentially affected applications in your environment, search for forged tokens usage (as explained in the next section) and leverage the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) published by Microsoft on their blog to look for any activity that originates from the IP addresses provided by Microsoft.In addition, make sure that none of the applications use a cached version of the Microsoft OpenID public certificates, and if so, refresh the cache.Microsoft has added additional verifications to the official Azure SDK, which are designed to prevent the use of MSA keys to authenticate to organization accounts. Users of the package are advised to update it to the latest version.How to detect the compromised key in your environment Since the threat actor can forge access tokens offline, there is no trail in the Azure portal for token issuance. The only way for cloud customers to identify whether the key was used to target their apps or users is by reviewing application-specific logs for potentially affected AAD apps. Therefore, application owners who want to protect their systems will have to check whether a forged token has been used against their applications.To the best of our knowledge, the only affected applications were those that utilized Microsoft v2.0 access token verification using the endpoints \u201dhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keyscommon\u201c and \u201chttps://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/discovery/v2.0/keys\u201c. These parameters make it feasible to filter out applications that were not exposed to this issue. First, to identify which AAD applications in your environment might be affected, you can run the following Azure CLI command: az ad app list --filter \"(signinaudience eq 'AzureADMultipleOrgs' or signinaudience eq 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' or signinaudience eq 'PersonalMicrosoftAccount')\" --query \"[?id].{AppName:displayName, AppID:appId, ObjID:id, HomePageURL:web.homePageUrl}\" Additionally, your AAD applications might also be associated with Azure WebApps. To identify which AAD apps are redirecting to any of your WebApps, you can run the following CLI command: az ad app list --filter \"(signinaudience eq 'AzureADMultipleOrgs' or signinaudience eq 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' or signinaudience eq 'PersonalMicrosoftAccount')\" --query \"[?web && web.homePageUrl && contains(web.homePageUrl, 'azurewebsites.net')].{AppName:displayName, AppID:appId, ObjID:id, HomePageURL:web.homePageUrl}\" Next, to identify potentially malicious activities in applications, it is necessary to examine suspicious authentication attempts via OpenID tokens signed by the compromised key. This can be done by unpacking the access tokens used against the application and searching for the string 1LTMzakihiRla_8z2BEJVXeWMqo within the kid field of the JOSE Header. According to Microsoft, the compromised key was inactive and therefore any access token signed by this key must be considered suspicious.Unfortunately, there is a lack of standardized practices when it comes to application-specific logging. Therefore, in most cases, application owners do not have detailed logs containing the raw access token or its signing key. As a result, identifying and investigating such events can prove exceedingly challenging for app owners.When examining an AAD application configured solely for multi-tenant authentication (without support for Microsoft personal accounts), it is possible to detect forged tokens by filtering for `iss` and `tid` claims within the access token. Applications commonly use these fields and they are more likely to be present in application logs. Moreover, any attempt to connect with an access token signed by the MSA tenant ID 9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad may indicate the use of a compromised key.Finally, if you\u2019ve enabled\u202fHTTP Logs\u202fin your WebApp, you might be able to see which IP addresses have accessed your application. Based on\u202fMicrosoft\u2019s blogpost, the following IP addresses are associated with the threat actor, so you should validate if your WebApp might have been impacted by running the following query in Log Analytics for each of your potentially affected Web Apps: AppServiceHTTPLogs | where Result == \"Success\" and CIp in (\"195.26.87.219\",\"185.236.228.183\",\"85.239.63.160\",\"193.105.134.58\",    \"146.0.74.16\",\"91.231.186.226\",\"91.222.174.41\",\"185.38.142.249\",    \"51.89.156.153\",\"176.31.90.129\",\"137.74.181.100\",\"193.36.119.45\",    \"185.158.248.159\",\"131.153.78.188\",\"37.143.130.146\",\"146.70.157.45\",    \"185.195.200.39\",\"185.38.142.229\",\"146.70.121.44\",\"31.42.177.181\",    \"185.51.134.52\",\"173.44.226.70\",\"45.14.227.233\",\"185.236.231.109\",    \"178.73.220.149\",\"45.14.227.212\",\"91.222.173.225\",\"146.70.35.168\",    \"146.70.157.213\",\"31.42.177.201\",\"5.252.176.8\",\"80.85.158.215\",    \"193.149.129.88\",\"5.252.178.68\",\"116.202.251.8\") For additional guidance on searching for signs of persistence in your environment, see our \u201cCircleCI Incident Sign of Persistence\u201d blog. Key Takeaways The full impact of this incident is much larger than we Initially understood it to be. We believe this event will have long lasting implications on our trust of the cloud and the core components that support it, above all, the identity layer which is the basic fabric of everything we do in cloud. We must learn from it and improve.At this stage, it is hard to determine the full extent of the incident as there were millions of applications that were potentially vulnerable, both Microsoft apps and customer apps, and the majority of them lack the sufficient logs to determine if they were compromised or not. However there are some critical actions items that application owners should perform. The first and foremost is to update their Azure SDK to the latest version and ensure their application cache is updated, otherwise their apps may still be vulnerable to a threat actor using the compromised key.We will continue to closely monitor this incident and provide updates; this is still an ongoing investigation and there are many unanswered questions (how did the threat actor acquire the key? When exactly did it happen? Were other keys compromised as well?). Finally, we want to thank the Microsoft team for working closely with us on this blog and helping us ensure it is technically accurate.See for yourself...Learn what makes Wiz the platform to enable your cloud security operationWatch a recorded demoOr schedule a live demo with usReferences https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/microsoft-mitigates-china-based-threat-actor-storm-0558-targeting-of-customer-email/ https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-193a https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/11/mitigation-china-based-threat-actor/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/ https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/pull/2136/files https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/commit/f17445bb9202a89964ea7311c4374806adfcb28c Tags:#Research#News",

After all, the public part is exposed at an URL you can retrieve whenever you're verifying the token.I've seen service provider implementations where the access token is exchanged for a cookie or other similar token, in which case you can't really do anything about it anymore for the lifetime of the cookie.But if you're always verifying the access token with a reasonably short cached key list, the service provider should be able to refuse the token reasonably quickly once the key is no longer advertised.replyThomasRooney 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Anecdotally, I ran an experiment with Envoy to see how far the number of signing keys could scale. This was for a B2B \u201cAPI Key\u201d auth solution; we wanted user keys to be self revocable, but just be a relatively standard JWT format for maintainability. The hypothesis was that, rather than running a whitelist or blacklist, we could improve the security signature by have 1 signing key for each JWT.When we ran some stress tests, turned out Envoy could happily run with ~300K signing keys in its JWK Set before noticeable service degradation occurred. Even then, by bumping up the memory on the validation servers, there was a small sacrifice of a few ms per extra 100K keys.This makes me fully agree that, for many applications, there\u2019s probably an opportunity to vastly improve the security surface by bumping up the number of signing keys dramatically.As long as both Keys and Signing keys define a KID, key verification is prefaced only by a hash table lookup or a tight loop through a keyset to find the appropriate Signing Key, before the slower verification procedure.replyvladvasiliu 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I guess 640K keys ought to be enough for anybody (TM)(r) (c)More seriously, though, I wonder how AzureAD is implemented and how hard it would be to scope keys per tenant, if not per application.

People just don't learn. For example currently there is a huge number of companies here in Poland that are migrating all of their cloud apps to GCP (Google cloud) from AWS. Why? Because Google has opened a region in Poland.AWS has live customer support you can ring (if you pay for it) and frequently as a client you get an account manager you can call in case of trouble and that person has direct access to support teams. These support peoole can actually fix stuff for you. Back in the day I've handled lots of support cases like this.Google on their website claims they also offer live support, but I read enough stories with headlines like \"Google deleted my business overnight and there's no one to talk to\" to question it's usefulness. I haven't had a chance to deal with Google's GCP support yet so I don't know how good or bad it might be, but I had a couple of support cases raised for other products (play store, book publishing etc) and it was obvious people that work there can't really do anything if stuff breaks. They're there just for Google to be able to say \"we too have live support\" and to tell you how to do stuff in lieu of documentation. When stuff breaks... You get an email \"we're escalating it _to_developers_\" to never hear from them again (or you get an email every month asking you if the issue is still ongoing)So I think it is the biggest case of \"putting all your eggs in one basket\" I saw in a while.

SDK's are well documented and generally have nice APIs as well.We've had very little reason to need support, operating a bunch of GKE clusters, VPNs to various partners plenty of databases, buckets, message queues, etc (non trivial setup)I do have some minor gripes that come to mind:- Cloud SQL not having a richer API, I'd love to be able to manage postgres permissions by IAM group membership, and grant/revoke postgres roles using the rest API instead of connecting as a postgres user (it'd make secure automation via terraform etc easier if I could lean on IAM)- VPC peering only allowing \"one hop\", which necessitates proxies even when using private service connect with two GCP products in some instances (eg: cloud SQL to datastream - why can't we just peer the two Google managed VPCs together? That would also avoid the proxy in our VPC)- On datastream, why can't I grant a Google managed service account IAM access to postgres instead of configuring a user/pass based user?- Why can't I configure a longer token expiration for artefact registry?

The rest of them are checked against the time at which they signed the next downstream certificate.I understand why code signing works like that.

They should never touch a developer or devops workstation.That's the point of KeyMux: keys never leave a secure enclave. In fact, KeyMux has no logic to load private keys or to perform key operations in-memory, except in the context of ephemeral TLS. The TLS layer does support using HSM keys for mTLS authentication, so you can use a security token for peer mTLS authentication to a network attached HSM.That's the whole point--you can use all the tools built and commonly used with in-memory keys, but using enclaved keys, instead.A follow-on idea I'd like to spend time on, if I have the chance, is to write modules for Vault and/or some KMIP implementation that integrate with the app so that authorization for key operations on a networked-attached key store require the consent of multiple parties (with that consent using local secure enclave-based authentication, of course). So, for example, if you're going to roll a release, one developer or an automated pipeline submits the request but the signing awaits confirmation from other team members.replywithinboredom 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I was pretty excited but then saw it was apple-only. I don't see support for TPM 2.0 coming soon, but instead things like smart cards.replywahern 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I had to draw a line so I could actually release something. But Windows and Linux support is definitely a target. In fact, the core software was originally developed on both macOS and Linux with PC/SC smart cards (both PIV and OpenPGP) and Vault as key stores, but without any GUI components--everything compiled into a set of PKCS#11 (for OpenSSH, OpenSSL ENGINE, etc) and PC/SC modules (for GnuPG). And I stayed away from macOS and Linux APIs as much as possible to ease a Windows port.But friends and coworkers I explained and showed the idea to didn't get it conceptually (e.g. people have the idea of key rotation drilled into their head as if that's the alternative to HSMs, instead of it being a mitigation for a fundamentally broken key management ecosystem), plus most people just wanted something they could point SSH_AUTH_SOCK at, so there needed to be a daemon/menubar/taskbar service. Ultimately the hard part was modeling and building a GUI around the concept, so it would be easier to understand and use. To get something out the door I targeted my daily desktop environment, macOS. It's using Yue as the GUI toolkit, which supports Linux/Gtk, macOS, and Windows.I took a year off of work to finally get the idea out of my head, which I had been mulling over for many years. But now I find myself in the middle of a downturn in the software engineering job market (anybody hiring or interested in investing?), so while I have work in progress to round out the macOS app features, Linux and Windows (which is really where the commercial viability exists, I think), will need to wait until I have some cashflow.I'd like to eventually release the Linux work as open source. But FWIW if someone has a specific use case in mind and is willing to fund development, I could very quickly build and release a [non-GUI] Linux package. PKCS#11 and PC/SC Linux modules still build in the tree, and adding a TPM key store adapter along side the other internal adapters would be relatively simple. In fact, a Linux PKCS#11 module for accessing Vault Transit Engine keys with TPM 2.0 mTLS authentication would be maybe 1-2 weeks of effort; slightly less if just straight TPM 2.0 support. Most of the implementation is already there, but polishing and testing something which can be supported long-term takes some effort.replywithinboredom 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Oh yeah.
