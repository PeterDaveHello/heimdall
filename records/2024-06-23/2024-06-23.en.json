    "originBody": "dropofahat.zone Me (Twitter) I am using AI to automatically drop hats outside my window onto New Yorkers Book the midtown DropofaHat Zone now! I am a simple midwesterner living in the middle of New York City. I put my shoes on one at a time, I apologize when I bump into people on the street, and I use AI inference (https://universe.roboflow.com/test-y7opj/drop-of-a-a-ha) to drop hats on heads when they stand outside my apartment. Like anybody else. I use it myself. I have extremely high foot traffic outside my window. I see a sea of uncovered heads in the sun. I believe DropofaHat.zone will become the first of many window based stores. Here a busy New Yorker can book a 5 minute time slot, pay for a hat, stand in a spot under my window for 3 seconds, have a hat put on their head, and get on with their extremely important, extemely busy day all within a single New York minute. How to use AI to do Dropshipping: My dream is for all the city windows to be constantly dropping things on us all the time. You will need a Raspberry Pi, an Adafruit stepper for the mechanism, some yarn, Roboflow for the AI, and a very low weight but very cool product (like Propeller Hats) Just Opening the Window The Hat The Dropping Mechanism The AI The Grand Vision Just Opening the Window This was a challenge. My window only opens about 4 inches. If I couldn't figure this out, my entire business had no chance. There must have been some kind of key or screw I had to take off to let it open, but I saw no sign of anything other than some very tiny slots on the bottom. If I could just look up what kind of window I had, I figured I could find out what kind of lock goes with it. This turned out to be pretty confusing. I think I have a double pane awning? Maybe? Every type of window can look like many other types. I finally resorted to just googling \"window keys\" and going through all the images of ones that looked like they could somehow fit my window. Most looked like they needed a lock until I came across this weird shape. I was fully expecting to buy a dozen other keys but this one actually worked! The Hat Next was deciding what hats I am going to drop and sell. My window is pretty high. It needed to be a hat that wouldn't hurt someone or fly into traffic. I decided I needed something to signify the future. Something that would look beautiful as it gracefully fell out of a window onto your head. Propeller Hats! And this one has a stylish Eagle to represent the flying it is about to do. The Dropping Mechanism This was the simplest thing to get working. I had a Raspberry Pi and an stepper motor lying around so I decided to put them to work. After imagining some extra sharp blades on tiny motor somehow cutting yarn, I realized I could just wrap the yarn around the stepper motor and have it move slightly. I had a giant camera gimbal to test on and was fully prepared to stick it out the window when I realized the string could just hang over the window with this method. I literally copied this out of the Adafruit tutorial for the stepper motor. This is a single python file on the Raspberry Pi that the computer will run when the AI determines someone is standing in the right spot and ready to receive their hat. On the Raspberry Pi as \"dropHat.py\" The AI I figured the AI would be the hardest part but it was surprisingly quick. I put a webcam out over the window and wanted to have inference run live on the video. I wanted the AI to literally show me what it was seeing. This would allow me to potentially live stream the feed later. And also it just seemed really cool to watch. This is what the full webcam stream looks like. I selected object detection for the initial model and then recorded a couple minutes of pedestrians walking under my window with their hatless heads. Then it was time to annotate images. I only wanted the model to tell me when someone was on the exact sidewalk square directly under my window. I put the class and prompt \"person\" and a lot of annotating was done for me automatically. The rest I dragged a box around the person if they were on the right part of the sidewalk or marked as null if not. You can view the annotated images here: https://universe.roboflow.com/test-y7opj/drop-of-a-a-hat/browse Obviously, your window view will look different from mine so you will have to record a few minutes and upload your own. The model seemed to work well with only 133 images annotated. I made sure there was a mix of positive and null ones. Since I only cared about a really small section the sidewalk, I added a pre-processor step of cropping the image. While this worked, I realized I would bump the webcam every now and then so I wanted a more generalized model. I removed the cropping and it worked oddly well. It only \"detected\" the image when it was in the spot I wanted. Even though I only tried it with one person in the annotating, it already worked on whoever walked by. Finally, I had a working model. You can view mine here: https://universe.roboflow.com/test-y7opj/drop-of-a-a-hat/model/2 Now we have to run a python program on the computer running your webcam. I want this code to do 2 things: Confirm someone is standing in the correct spot for 3 seconds straight Call the Raspberry Pi after the 3 seconds have passed. On your computer with the webcam, pip install the inference library and the SSH libraries I used This is the entire python file. You will have to put in your own API key. I want mine to stay in the free tier. It works by calling the model every second and if it confirms someone is in that spot 3 seconds in a row, it will SSH into my Raspberry Pi and run the function dropHat.py. The Grand Vision There is a bigger dream here. Picture a world where you can walk around New York City and everything you need is falling out of windows onto you. At a moments notice, at the drop of a hat. That's a world I want to live in. That's why I'm teaching you how to do yourself.

The author overcame many challenges and wrote about them in a style as if he solved the hardest parts with only a little fiddling. Maybe he's already seasoned in the ML and robotics domains? So much fun to read. Regarding the Video Object Detection: Why does inference need to be done via Roboflow SaaS? ...(api_url=\"https://detect.roboflow.com\", api_key=\"API_KEY\") Is it because the Pi is too underpowered to run a fully on-device solution such as Frigate [0] or DOODS [1]? And presumably a Coral TPU wasn't considered because the author mostly used stuff he happened to have laying around. Can anyone comment contrasting experience with Roboflow? Does it perform better than Frigate and DOODS? Asking for a friend. I totally don't have announcement speakers throughout my house that I want to say \"Mom approaching the property\", \"Package delivered\", \"Dog spotted on a walk\", \"Dog owner spotted not picking up after their beast\", and so on. That last one will be tricky to pull off. Ah well :) [0] https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/pkgs/container/fr... [1] https://github.com/snowzach/doods2 reply yeldarb 18 minutes agoparentFWIW you can use roboflow models on-device as well. detect.roboflow.com is just a hosted version of our inference server (if you run the docker somewhere you can swap out that URL for localhost or wherever your self-hosted one is running). Behind the scenes it’s an http interface for our inference[1] Python package which you can run natively if your app is in Python as well. Pi inference is pretty slow (probably ~1 fps without an accelerator). Usually folks are using CUDA acceleration with a Jetson for these types of projects if they want to run faster locally. Some benefits are that there are over 100k pre-trained models others have already published to Roboflow Universe[2] you can start from, supports many of the latest SOTA models (with an extensive library[3] of custom training notebooks), tight integration with the dataset/annotation tools that are at the core of Roboflow for creating custom models, and good support for common downstream tasks via supervision[4].

Don’t forget that canonically in Mighty Ducks D2 Goldberg and Russ switched jerseys so that Russ could get his infamous “Knuckle Puck” shot off undisputed because everyone thought the puck was passed to Goldberg until the mask came off. So the ML training on jerseys would have missed this critical moment and potentially assigned the score to Goldberg, when really it was Russ (wearing Goldberg’s jersey) who should have gotten the credit. One might argue that this sort of thing rarely happens so it’s not worth doing more complex facial recognition vis a vis Jersey numbering. But I say that while it may be rare, when it does happen it’s a major event, so no complexity should be spared to ensure we capture it accurately. reply oaththrowaway 2 hours agorootparentTypically beer league players wear full face cages so facial recognition is harder to do reply blorenz 1 hour agorootparentprevI would have multiple camera footage.

Dropping things shouldn’t be illegal. Negligence that causes harm should be. Someone lowering a hat down on a string seems perfectly fine. Throwing a chair out a window seems bad.

For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting a kaggle account, learning by doing computer vision projects, and then using opencv to build the vision parts of the system. From Windows or Mac, you could build using a cloud system such as Amazon Bedrock. 2. It doesn't actually replace having a hat for the period from your own front door to OP's apartment. Most people I know own hats themselves or borrow from friends to be able to attend specific events, but they still carry a hat in case there are weather problems. This does not solve the availability issue. 3. It does not seem very \"viral\" or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this? [1] Actually I don't.

    "originLink": "https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2024-06-17-ruby-shellscript/",
    "originBody": "Ruby: a great language for shell scripts! 4 minute read IntroPermalink Ruby is so associated with its most famous framework, Rails, that many people forget how amazing this language is. I mean, I know a lot of people who says “I don’t like Ruby” and when I ask why, they say something about Rails. Personally, I consider Ruby one of my favorite programming languages, and the last time I touched any Rails code was 7 years ago… So, if I don’t use Rails anymore, what I do with Ruby? Well, Ruby is a very rich and complete language, perhaps even more than its more famous relative, Python (sadly, I can’t say the same about its ecosystem…). And one of the things that I think that Ruby is better than Python is using it for writing shell scripts. That is, most of the cases Bash for me is enough, but if the script starts to become complex, I switch to Ruby. Here I show the main features that might be interesting for this case of use. GoalsPermalink Show features of Ruby that are useful for writing shell scripts; Compare Ruby to Bash and Python; Non-goalsPermalink Replace entirely Bash scripts by Ruby scripts. Feature 1: calling external commandsPermalink The first thing that you expect of language for writing shell scripts is to call external commands. In Ruby, you do that using backticks (`): `ls` That’s it! You don’t need system, popen or something like that, or import a library. And if you set that to a variable, you’ll have the output of the command: my_date=`date` Note: if you want to use system (e.g. if you want the output to be redirected to stdout instead of a string) or popen (if you want to read or write data from or to a subprocess), those are also available in Ruby! Feature 2: status codePermalink This is real quick: in Ruby, the variable $? contains the status code of the last executed command. So, it’s really close to Bash: `true` puts $? # 0 `false` puts $? # 1 Feature 3: it’s a typed languagePermalink Ruby is not a statically typed language, but it has types. In fact, it is a object-oriented language, and it follow strictly the OOP paradigm (more than Python, in some aspects even more than Java!). Bash, on the other hand, everything is a string, and that leads to several safety issues… total_lines = `wc -l my_file`.to_i # an int containing the number of lines of a file half = total_lines.div 2 # integer division puts `head -n #{half} my_file` # print half of the file Feature 4: functional constructionsPermalink Ruby implements map, select (filter), reduce, flat_map and other functional operations as methods. So, you can, for example, apply a map over a command output: puts `ls`.lines.map { |name| name.strip.length } # prints the lengths of the filenames Note for Git lovers: I know that I could do that only using git branch --show-current, but that was the first example that came in my mind to demonstrate the use of regex… Feature 5: regex matchingPermalink Regex is a type in Ruby, and operations using regex are built-in in the language. Look at this example, where we get the current git branch name calling git branch: current_branch_regex = /^\\* (\\S+)/ output_lines = `git branch`.lines output_lines.each do |line| if line =~ current_branch_regex # match the string with the regex puts $1 # prints the match of the first group end end Feature 6: easy threadsPermalink If want to work with multiple threads, Ruby is perhaps the one of the easiest language to do it. Look: thread = Thread.new do puts \"I'm in a thread!\" end puts \"I'm outside a thread!\" thread.join So, it can be useful for, for example, downloading several files at the same time: (1..10).map do |i| # iterates from i=1 to i=10, inclusive Thread.new do `wget http://my_site.com/file_#{i}` # you can use variables inside commands! end end.each { |thread| thread.join } # do/end and curly braces have the same purpose! Feature 7: builtin file and dir operationsPermalink In Ruby, all the file operations are methods of the File class and all the directory operations are methods of the Dir class, as it should be. In Python, for example, if you want to read a file you use open, but if you want to delete it you need to use os.remove, and os does a lot of other things that are not related to files. So, in Ruby: exists = File.exists? 'My File' # methods that return booleans end in ? file_content = File.open('My File').read File.delete 'My File' # parentheses are optional if it's not ambiguous ConclusionPermalink I hope that after reading this short text you consider using Ruby as a replacement for complex shell scripts. I mean, I don’t expect that you drop Bash entirely, but consider using Ruby when things get complex. Of course, you can do that in Python, Perl, even JS, but, as my personal choice I think that Ruby is the most complete and easier Bash replacement for that! If you find something wrong, or if you have any suggestion, please let me know here. Updated: June 17, 2024",

    "commentBody": "Ruby: A great language for shell scripts (lucasoshiro.github.io)396 points by lucasoshiro 18 hours agohidepastfavorite278 comments codesnik 17 hours agoI sometimes wonder why we don't see ruby used for shell stuff more often. It inherited most of the good stuff for shell scripting from Perl, and Perl took a lot of it's syntax from sh and sed and awk, so almost anything you can do in shell script you can do in ruby, but with an option of making it gradually less terse and more readable, while having sane variables and data handling from the start. Also ruby is great in allowing complexity to grow smoothly, no sudden hiccups. You start with just one line (everything goes into module main implicitly), extend it to a single-file script, require some built-in libraries, then add a module or helper class in the same file, and only then maybe extract those files to required files, add gems, whatever. No boilerplate whatsoever, no jumps, no big rewrites. meanwhile, a lot of tooling nowadays is written in Go, and I have no idea why, it's not friendly for os manipulation at all, and number crunching power is not needed in many, many tasks of that sort. reply NullInvictus 16 hours agoparentI think the quality of a language for shell scripting is often secondary. What’s of greater significance is where it is at. I.e., does it have it already installed? The answer with Linux and Bash is almost always “yes”. Not so with ruby. The moment you start asking the user to install things, you’ve opened up the possibility for writing a program rather than a shell script. The lifecycle of a piece of software is almost always one of growing responsibility. This cycle is devastating when it happens to shell scripts. What was once a simple script slowly becomes creaking mass of untestable, poorly understood code playing in the traffic of swimming environments (which grep you got, buddy?). I guess I’m saying that once you open up the possibility of writing a program, you generally take that option and are usually happier for it. In the “write a program” world, ruby is still good, but it becomes a far harder question to answer whether ruby is still the right choice. There are a lot of languages with a lot of features engineers like. reply kqr 13 hours agorootparentThis is indeed why I use Perl over Ruby. As long as it's not for a Window machine, a Perl script is deployed by copying it over and that's it. reply brightball 6 hours agorootparentPerl is deeply underappreciated and needs a lot more love. One of the keynotes at the polyglot conference that I run is going to be Perl talk and I'm really looking forward to it. reply pdimitar 4 hours agorootparentDoes it still require global library / module installations for your script's dependencies? If so, hard pass. reply kqr 2 hours agorootparentIt does not, and has not for at least a decade! reply pdimitar 2 hours agorootparentSo any guides on how to make a self-contained Perl script that needs dependencies? reply shawn_w 1 hour agorootparentSee https://metacpan.org/pod/pp for one tool to do that. reply pmontra 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's true of Python and Perl as long as you keep using only the features built in in the core language (standard lib or whatever they call it.) The same applies to Ruby. My scripting language is bash in at least 99% of cases. I used to program in Perl when I need some complex logic. I stopped using it some 10 or 15 years ago when I switched to Ruby for two reasons: I became more familiar with it than with Perl and it's easier to manage data structures whenever I need something complex or classes. That doesn't happen often in scripts but as I wrote, I use bash for all the normal stuff. I use Python for the scripts that start an HTTP server because it has the http.server module in the standard lib and it's very simple to write handlers for GET, POST and all the other HTTP verbs. The last example was a script to test callbacks from an API. I just implemented two POST and PUT methods that print the request data and return 200 and a {} JSON. I think that to do the same in Ruby I would need to install the webrick gem. reply kqr 2 hours agorootparent> The same applies to Ruby. With a big difference -- Perl and Python will always be installed on these machines, whereas Ruby might need two deployment steps: (1) copy file, (2) install Ruby! reply BiteCode_dev 8 hours agorootparentprevIn fact, that's true for Python if you use a zipapp and no c extension: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html You can happily copy the zip of your scripts and all deps in the server. You still do have to mind your versions, as always with python. reply MaxBarraclough 7 hours agorootparentprevEven on Windows there's a good chance. The Git for Windows project bundles Perl, but not Ruby. reply noisy_boy 13 hours agorootparentprevThat was the reason Perl was what I switched too from bash when I was working on Solaris boxes; it was miles ahead of what was possible with bash AND it was already present. If I remember an older version of Python was also installed but by then Perl had already got me reeled in and I felt Python to be too \"verbose\" compared to Perl (I eventually changed my opinion when I got a bit more experience under my belt). reply kqr 12 hours agorootparentInteresting! I still find Python too verbose to stand in for shell scripts when Perl is available, with what I think is a decent chunk of experience. reply petre 12 hours agorootparentprevOne usually needs modules to easily do something more advanced, but yes, Perl is almost always installed. Although I find Ruby much more ergonomic, I still reach for Perl as well because I know it better and don’t have to open the documentation so often. reply pdimitar 4 hours agorootparentprev> I.e., does it have it already installed? The answer with Linux and Bash is almost always “yes”. Not so with ruby. True, not true for Ruby, but with Golang and Rust you have an almost-no-dependencies final binary so the argument there does not apply. > which grep you got, buddy? For dev machines it's not such a tall order to require `rg` be installed these days. reply oopsallmagic 10 hours agorootparentprevNot once have I worked anywhere where the people writing shell scripts didn't also control all of the boxen those scripts ran on. reply vault 9 hours agorootparentI'm glad you never worked at a bank or an insurance company! reply vsuperpower2020 8 hours agorootparentWhy do you choose to write in a snarky way? Why does that make you glad? Why does this make you energetic? reply throwaway7ahgb 5 hours agorootparentIt's tongue in cheek, and he's right. I am a old man Sunos/VMS/Linux admin. Having root used to be my god given right. However I haven't worked at a company in years that gives anyone access to root anywhere except your own local machine or maybe in rare cases a dev box that is destroyed and rebuilt at will. reply shlant 6 hours agorootparentprevyea as soon as I read through the post, I ssh'd into one of my many Ubuntu servers, ran `ruby -v` and then noped out. From past experience I want nothing to do with trying to wrangle RVM or rbenv and then making sure the paths work properly. reply asa400 14 hours agoparentprev> I sometimes wonder why we don't see ruby used for shell stuff more often. The reason we don't see Ruby used more for shell stuff is because Python won this particular war. It's already installed on basically every Linux distribution out there, and this simple fact outweighs all other language considerations for probably >95% of people who are writing shell scripts in something that isn't Bash. Personally, I don't much like Python, and even though Ruby is not my favorite language either, I find it much better than Python for this kind of work. But I don't get to decide how Debian builds their infrastructure, so in the end, I tend to use Python. reply lwrtac 7 hours agorootparentYes, Python won the war, which is a pity. Linux distributions started getting bloated at the same time they switched to Python for everything. Yum hanging inexplicably and such things never occurred before. The BSDs do not have this problem (yet!). I hope they stay sane and keep using Perl/sh. reply curt15 29 minutes agorootparentYum hangs not because of Python but because Fedora's RPM metadata is bloated compared to other distros so yum has to load and process much more data. reply nevdka 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is also the reason perl was used before python began to dominate. It was installed everywhere before python was installed everywhere. reply mu53 14 hours agorootparentprevthis whole argument is silly. In my time on this site, I have seen someone suggest that every language is good for shell scripting including C. Python and bash are used in the real world most often because convincing your sysadmin/infra/boss guy to install ruby for one script is a hard sell when you already have good-enough tools built into the system that don't add risk/complexity. reply shmerl 14 hours agorootparentprevHow hard is to install it though? That doesn't sound like a reason not to use it. reply theshrike79 12 hours agorootparentIf a client has certified a specific Linux distro as an approved platform, that's what we use. We can either deliver a single executable (Go) or a Python script, as python is preinstalled on their distro. If we'd want to use Ruby, it'd be a huge hassle of re-certifying crap and bureauracy and approvals and in that time we'd have the Python solution already running. reply throwaway7ahgb 5 hours agorootparentprevHow hard is it to install anything? That really isn't the point. reply shmerl 3 hours agorootparentSeems like a lot below and around bring this as the main point for not using it. Which doesn't make sense to me. reply oopsallmagic 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's not. This is a non-issue. Every web shop is writing bash to twiddle a build script on servers they also manage, which includes the ability to install any package they want. reply asa400 14 hours agorootparentprevDepends on you, your team, your target hardware/os, your project, and many other factors. Considering all of those things, the hurdle of installation might just be too large for it to be worth it. reply throwaway55533 14 hours agorootparentprevMitigating the risk of downloading a script from the internet and executing it -- even from a \"trusted\" website or package manager -- is absolutely a good reason not to use it. reply shmerl 14 hours agorootparentAny decent distro has it. So you don't need to execute any random scripts, just install it or prepare the image with it for your OS install. That's it. I don't really get this whole defaults being a blocker for tools choice. reply paulddraper 14 hours agorootparentprevSignificantly harder than doing nothing reply tayo42 14 hours agorootparentprev> It's already installed on basically every Linux distribution out there, PEP 668 pretty much negates this though. To do anything you need a python environment set up per script/project w/e reply kristjansson 13 hours agorootparentIff you’re going beyond stdlib. Which lots of useful python programs don’t need to do. reply sgarland 6 hours agorootparentprevPython ships with venv support. It’s not that difficult to bootstrap a venv before running your script, and that’s only if you actually need tooling other than stdlib, which you probably don’t. reply tayo42 4 hours agorootparentIt's definitely clunky and tedious to switch between every projects or scripts environment. Idk why people are pretending there aren't tons of useful libraries out there. Like if you want to script anything with aws, use yaml reply sgarland 2 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of ways to have the venv automatically activate (and de-activate) when you enter/leave the directory for the project. direnv [0], mise [1], or various shell hooks. There are useful libraries, I’m not saying there aren’t. I just dislike it when people include one as a dependency when they really didn’t need it. [0]: https://github.com/direnv/direnv [1]: https://github.com/jdx/mise reply BiteCode_dev 8 hours agorootparentprevEven if you don't want to limit yourself to the stdlib, you can still use a zipapp : https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html reply tayo42 4 hours agorootparentYou need to introduce a build and release process then to do this then which still detracts from it being simple or the selling point being it's already installed. reply oopsallmagic 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd of course, it is impossible to install additional interpreters on the computer. reply carstenhag 4 hours agorootparentI never started using python, ruby or node because all of them were a pain to use for me - this was 7-8 years ago, so maybe it has changed a lot. But even 2-3 years ago I had lots of issues just running one python project. Module, not module, pip or not... Way too confusing, compared to go for example. Or hell, even Java/Kotlin when you use an IDE and it autoconfigures most things. reply shagie 15 hours agoparentprev> ... maybe extract those files to required files, add gems, whatever. CPAN is the killer feature of Perl. It just works. First off, most of the time I don't need a CPAN module for doing shell scripting in perl. Perl itself is rich enough with the file manipulations that are needed for any script of less than 100 lines. My experiences with Ruby and installing gems have been less pleasant. Different implementations of Ruby. Gems that don't compile / work on certain architectures. Breaking changes going forward where a script that was written 2 years ago doesn't work anymore. Sometimes it's someone was doing something clever in the language that doesn't work anymore. Other times its some gem got updated and can't be used that way anymore. ... which brings us to ... I believe that Go's advantages come into play when the program gets more complex that that 100 line size and it becomes a \"program\" rather than a \"script\" that has complexity to deal with. Furthermore, executables built in Go are most often statically linked which means that someone upgrading the libraries doesn't break what is already working. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentDoes anyone under age 50 or so even know Perl? reply pcwalton 13 hours agorootparentI'm not even 40 and I remember it well enough. reply mekster 14 hours agorootparentprevMake it 30 and it's actually a question. reply kfrzcode 14 hours agorootparentprevYes. reply newalexandria 14 hours agorootparentDo you all order the same thing when you get together at the cafe? reply seabrookmx 17 hours agoparentprevI think golang is used because you can easily create a single static binary, which is incredibly easy to distribute. I often find non-trivial CLI tools written in Python cumbersome because of the dependency wrangling necessary. reply noisy_boy 16 hours agorootparentI think one of the advantages of a script is that you can quickly check what it is doing by simply opening it - an executable won't afford that. reply m00x 13 hours agorootparentPlus it can be run on any machine, while golang needs to be compiled for the specific architecture you'll be running it on. No messing about trying to get the right build. reply type0 3 hours agorootparentI actually think its a less of a problem than many imagine. If you have different architectures it actually is better and more predictable because it's compiled, also it's incredibly easy to compile even for noobs reply MikeTheGreat 15 hours agorootparentprev> I often find non-trivial CLI tools written in Python cumbersome because of the dependency wrangling necessary. I'm thinking of trying out Mojo in large part because they say they're aiming for Python compatibility, and they produce single-file executables. Previous to that I was using PyInstaller but it was always a little fragile (I had to run the build script a couple of times before it would successfully complete). Currently I'm using pipx and Poetry, which seems pretty good (100% success rate on builds, and when my 5-line build script fails it's because of an actual error on my part). Which is a round-about way of asking everyone: Does anyone have any other good way(s) to build single-file executables with Python? reply qznc 7 hours agorootparentScriptisto is an underrated tool: https://github.com/igor-petruk/scriptisto It can do the Python venv stuff behind the scenes for you and it just looks like a single Python file. reply teleforce 14 hours agorootparentprevFun fact, you can use D language as compiled scripting using rdmd with powerful and modern programming features although it has much faster compilation than comparable C++ and Rust [1]. The default GC make it intuitive and Pythonic for quick scripting more than Go. Its recent native support for OS lingua franca C is the icing on the cake [2]. From the website, \"D's blazingly fast compilation allows it to be used as a high level, productive scripting language, but with the advantages of static type checking\" [3].

[1]: https://nuitka.net/ reply theshrike79 12 hours agorootparentprevI spent a weekend going through all my old python scripts with Gemini and ChatGPT, rewriting them to Go just because of this. Most of them were so old that I would have had to skip like 3 generations of package managers to get to the one that's used this year (dunno about next year) if I wanted to upgrade or add dependencies. With Go I can just develop on my own computer, (cross)compile and scp to the destination and it'll keep working. reply aae42 17 hours agorootparentprevI've been waiting for a single executable interpreter for Ruby for a while now like deno or bun, but for Ruby artichoke ruby is the closest we've got reply schneems 15 hours agorootparentprevBootstrapping and different behavior for different versions and not being able to use the dependency ecosystem really make it a lot more difficult than people realize if you’re trying to “script” at scale. I’ve used rust for this task but people get mad that I’m calling it a “script”. “That’s not a script that’s a program” which…sure. But so maybe we need another term for it? “Production-scripts” or something. My experience is rewriting Ruby and bash buildpacks for the open spec CNCF Cloud Native Buildpack project (CNB) https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks I agree that Ruby is easier to start and grow complexity, that would be a good place to start. reply derefr 17 hours agorootparentprevThis complaint comes up enough that I'm surprised nobody's created the Ruby equivalent of GraalVM, to compile a Ruby script, all its deps, and a WPOed subset of the Ruby runtime, into a native executable. reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparentIt's not quite what you're describing, but TruffleRuby is Ruby on GraalVM: https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby Unlike GraalVM Java, as far as I can tell TruffleRuby doesn't provide a bundler that can create a single executable out of everything, but in principle I don't see why it couldn't. reply mike_hearn 46 minutes agorootparentWorth noting that the GraalPython implementation does support creating a single binary. https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/python/stand... I'm not sure I'd try replacing shell scripts with natively compiled Python binaries. That said, I use a Kotlin Scripting based bash replacement in my own work that has many useful features for shell scripting and is generally much more pleasant. You have to \"install\" it in the sense of having it extracted somewhere, but it runs on Win/Mac/Linux and can be used without root etc. reply kaba0 10 hours agorootparentprevGraal can create an executable from a ruby program as well with TruffleRuby and native image (both part of the general graal project). reply pansa2 17 hours agorootparentprevWPO? reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentWhile Program Optimization, in this case mostly meaning dead-code elimination for any runtime code not called by the Ruby code. reply bongobingo1 14 hours agorootparentI think you mean Whole Program Optimization. reply shitlord 13 hours agorootparentprevThe ability to type check and unit test your code is also valuable. This is possible with many languages but with Go it requires basically zero configuration. reply danmur 16 hours agorootparentprevBundle it into a pex and distribute that. Its still way large but its easy to distribute. reply mikepurvis 15 hours agorootparentPex was also the solution I landed on after evaluating several non-container options for distributing a Python project to arbitrary Linux hosts. It works well but with one huge caveat: although you bring the stuff required to reconstitute the venv with you, you’re actually still using the system’s python executable and stdlib!! So for example if you want to make a project targeting all supported Ubuntu LTS versions, you have to include the wheels for every possible python version you might hit. Ultimately this boils down to there not really being a story for statically compiled python, so in most normal cases you end up wanting a chroot and at that point you’re in a container anyway. reply networked 8 hours agorootparentI wish an easy cross-platform PEX or shiv [1] were a thing. Binary dependencies are the biggest reason I prefer the new inline script metadata spec (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline...) and `pipx run`. Luckily, they're pretty great. They have changed how I write Python scripts. The way inline script metadata works is that your script declares arbitrary dependencies in a structured top comment, and a compliant script runner must provide them. Here is an example from a real script: #! /usr/bin/env -S pipx run # /// script # dependencies = [ # \"click==8.*\", # \"Jinja2==3.*\", # \"tomli==2.*\", # ] # requires-python = \">=3.8\" # /// pipx implements the spec with cached per-script virtual environments. It will download the dependencies, create a venv for your script, and install the dependencies in the venv the first time you invoke the script. The idea isn't new: you could do more or less the same with https://github.com/PyAr/fades (2014) and https://github.com/jaraco/pip-run (2015). However, I only adopted it after I saw https://peps.python.org/pep-0722/, which PEP 723 replaced and became the current standard. It is nice to have it standardized and part of pipx. For really arbitrary hosts with no guarantee of recent pipx, there is https://pip.wtf and my venv version https://github.com/dbohdan/pip-wtenv. Personally, I'd go with `pipx run` instead whenever possible. [1] I recommend shiv over PEX for pure-Python dependencies because shiv builds faster. Have a look at https://shiv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history.html. reply mikepurvis 2 hours agorootparentAll else being equal I’d probably prefer poetry for the broader project structure, but that would definitely be compelling single script use cases. reply networked 2 hours agorootparentYou can also combine the two.

Ruby has not been the same language for very long. Migrating to 1.9 was a huge hassle for many firms. This may seem like a long time ago in tech years; but then there was Ruby 2.0; and shell scripts, meanwhile, have stayed the same the whole time. A secondary reason is that Ruby has been very slow for much of its life, which means that for situations where you need to run a huge stack of scripts -- init systems, for example -- it would be punishing. Ruby does have a terse and intuitive syntax that would make for a good system shell. Although it has some magic, it is less magical and confusing than shell itself. Ruby provides many basic data types that experience has proven are useful for shell scripting -- like arrays and dictionaries -- and they are integrated in a much cleaner and clearer way than they are integrated into widely used shells like Bash. System tools that are written in Go may still make sense to write in Go, though. Go, it is true, does not have a nice terse syntax for short scripts and one liners; and it doesn't have a default execution model where everything is in main and so on; but that is because it is not a scripting language. Other languages used to write system tools and system services -- like C, C++, Java and Rust -- don't have those things either. reply cortesoft 16 hours agorootparent> Migrating to 1.9 was a huge hassle for many firms.

As an outside observer of the Ruby world, I have an impression that it was Ruby MRI that was slow. CPU-bound synthetic benchmarks like the much-criticized Benchmarks Game showed Ruby ≤ 1.8 a good deal slower than CPython 2. Here is an illustrative comment from that time: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=253310. People also complained about early Rails, and the perception of Ruby's performance got mixed up with that of Rails. Then YARV came out, and Ruby became several times faster than its MRI former self on different benchmarks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YARV#Performance). With YARV, Ruby gradually caught up to \"fast\" interpreted languages. Now interpreted Ruby seems as fast as CPython 3 or faster in synthetic benchmarks (for example, https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks/blob/7bf440499e2b1e81fb...), though still behind the fastest mainstream interpreters like Lua's.

They shouldn't have everything installed on them as that broadens the attack footprint. They should be doing one thing, and one thing only.

Installing python and other general purpose tools gives any attacker that gets into a docker container many more tools to work with for getting out. For docker, the trend isn't \"build a general purpose machine\" but rather \"what can we slim this down to that only has the bare minimum in it?\" This can be taken all the way to the distroless images ( https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless ) and means that the security team won't be asking you to fix that CVE that's in Python that you don't use.

Other tricks I rely on: a) put a `binding.irb` (or `binding.pry`) in any rescue block you may have in your script - it'll allow you to jump in and see what went wrong in an interactive way. (You'll need a `require 'irb'` in your script too, ofc) b) I always use `Pathname` instead of `File` - it's part of the standard library, is a drop in replacement for `File` (and `Dir`) and generally has a much more natural API. c) Often backticks are all you need, but when you need something a little stronger (e.g. when handling filenames with spaces in them, or potentially hostile user input, etc), Ruby has a plethora of tools in its stdlib to handle any scenario. First step would be `system` which escapes inputs for you (but doesn't return stdout). d) Threads in Ruby are super easy, but using `Parallel` (not part of the stdlib) can make it even easier! A contrived example: `Parallel.map(url_list) { |url| Benchmark.measure { system('wget', url) }.real }.sum` to download a bunch of files in parallel and get the total time.

Rich Python support in VSCode is seamless and simple. Coming back to Ruby after that caught me off guard - it feels like I'm writing syntax-highlighted plain text. There's an LSP extension from Shopify, but it's temperamental and I have trouble getting it working.

Constantly turned off inline errors and warnings because they were almost always wrong - packages I installed “could not be found” by the LSP, it constantly worried about type issues that were no longer incorrect, it didn’t pick up function changes across files, etc etc. Then you think “maybe I just have the wrong lsp” only to realize there are half a dozen that all behave differently and nobody can agree on. I tried them all, they all turned even my simplest of scripts between 10-50% red.

Make it difficult to ignore that a function can return an error. This is the golang approach. Errors are part of the return values and unused return values are compiler errors. 2. Make it impossible to use parts of the return value having an error state. Rust does this with the Result sum type and pattern matching. 3. Tailor for the happy-path and throw exceptions in case there are any errors. With optional means to catch them if recovering errors is desired. This is how most other languages function. Hiding the error status in another variable, that is super easy to overlook and that the programmer might not even know exists, then continuing despite this variable not being checked will inevitably introduce bugs allowing faulty data in your system. reply kouteiheika 8 hours agoparentprev> You really want to read the directory and map over the stat function (or equivalent) to get the length.

So for me, \"is it installed in the base distribution\" is the difference between being able to start immediately no matter which box I'm concerned with, and spending months trying to upstream a new program to be installed with our OS image team. I took a look around a vanilla Debian 12 box, and didn't see Ruby in there [1].

For me, when Bash ain't enough I upgrade to the Project language (PHP, Python, JS, etc). For compiled project I reach for LSB language (Perl, Python) before introducing a new dependency. reply cortesoft 17 hours agoparentRuby is fantastic for the main project language, too! And is also standard on many Linux distros. reply simoncion 17 hours agorootparentRuby's fine for small to medium-sized projects. It's pretty great for small DSLs. In my professional experience on medium to large-sized projects, its lack of explicit typing, the habit of Rubyists to use its fairly-substantial metaprogramming capabilities at the drop of a hat, and (for projects that include pieces or all of Rails) the system's implicit library loading make such projects a nightmare to reason about and maintain. I'm sure these aspects are manageable with a small group, or a very, very disciplined group, but when you have large-sized projects that have been continually worked on for ten, fifteen, more years, you're just not going to be able to guarantee that everyone involved will have the combination of knowledge and discipline require to ensure the thing remains easy to understand, extend, and maintain. reply cortesoft 16 hours agorootparentI work on a 12 year old Ruby project at my job, and while some of what you say is true, I still love working on it more than anything else. reply amarshall 16 hours agorootparentprevImplicit library loading isn’t even the real problem, it’s the global namespace. I think it, more than anything else, makes large projects difficult to manage due to the inability to grok the dependency graph. reply IshKebab 12 hours agorootparentprevThis has been my experience too reading the Gitlab code. It's absolutely impossible to follow - you can't use static typing to follow flow because there isn't any, and you can't even grep for identifiers because half of them are dynamically generated. Every time I've wanted to understand something I've been unable to even find the relevant code. Contrast that with gitlab-runner (Go) or VSCode (Typescript) both of which I have been able to not only read easily but contribute features to. VSCode is at least as big a codebase as Gitlab.

You mention using threads and regex match global variables in the same write up.

It even lets you access named capture groups in the match response using the already familiar Hash access API. Example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18825787 In general, just don’t use global variables in Ruby. It’s already SO easy to move “but it has to be global” functionality to static class methods or constants that I’ve encountered exactly zero cases where I have NEEDED global variables. Even if you need a “stateful constant” Ruby had a very convenient Singleton mixin that provides for a quick and easy solution. Besides, if you actually WERE to take advantage of them being global VARIABLES (reassigning the value) I would confidently bet that your downstream code would break, because I’m guessing said downstream code assumes the global value is constant. Just avoid them, there’s no point, use constants.

One tweak that allows for easier lazy iteration over the file (while keeping temporary disk Io reasonable) is to pipe it through zcat, jq in stream mode to convert to ndjson, gzip again - for a temp file that ruby zlib can wrap for a stream convenient for lazy iteration per read_line...).

But for example, let's say I wanted to make a hash (dict) of files, keyed by their size (for some unknown reason), in Ruby it would look like: Pathname.glob('*').filter { |f| f.file? }.each_with_object({}) { |f, h| h[f.size] = f } Whereas the equivalent Python would be: result = {} for file_path in glob.glob('*'): if os.path.isfile(file_path): result[os.path.getsize(file_path)] = file_path Or capitalizing a string in Ruby: string.split(' ').map(&:capitalize).join(' ') And in Python: words = string.split(' ') capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words] result = ' '.join(capitalized_words) Python seems to be more convoluted and verbose to me, and requires more explicit variable declarations too. With the Ruby you can literally read left to right and know what it does, but with the Python, I find I have to jump about a bit to grok what's going on. But maybe that's just my lack of Python experience showing. reply ndand 6 hours agorootparentYou can capitalize a string in Python using functional style ' '.join(map(str.capitalize, string.split(' '))) which is similar to the example in Ruby, except the operations are written in reverse order. reply pseudalopex 6 hours agorootparentprevresult = {os.path.getsize(f): f for f in os.listdir() if os.path.isfile(f)} result = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in string.split(' ')) result = ' '.join(map(str.capitalize, string.split(' '))) result = string.title() reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentprevfrom string import capwords result = capwords(string) This does the split/capitalize/join dance, all in one.

Box plots don't make anything bell shaped (they don't change the distribution), they assume that your data follows a bell/gaussian shape. This is correct in cases where the central limit theorem can be applied (which is almost everywhere) - but when that is not the case, the assumption is wrong and you shouldn't use a box plot anyways, because the values it shows have no real use. There are very real use cases for box plots, but people need to understand the basics of statistics before they can use them. reply rcxdude 10 hours agoparentNah, there's nothing in a box plot which assumes a bell-shape. It does, however just visualise the parameters which reasonably well characterize a smooth single-mode distribution regardless of the underlying distribution. So it's a valid criticism of using box plots, especially when the alternatives can just as well visualise a bell-shaped distribution, as well as showing when it is not. reply quietbritishjim 9 hours agorootparent> smooth single-mode distribution That IS a bell curve. While it's true that the Guassian distribution is often called a bell curve or even \"the\" bell curve, a non-Guassian single mode distribution is still absolutely bell shaped in a general sense. So, although you started your comment with \"nah\", you're actually in agreement with the content you replied to. reply conformist 8 hours agorootparentIn the mathematical sense this is clearly not true - it’s easy to come up with a smooth single mode distribution that doesn’t look like a bell. reply thaumasiotes 8 hours agorootparentIs it? How? You could include a lot of little bells far from the single mode, but that's reading a little too much into the literal meaning of \"single mode\" - a \"bimodal\" distribution isn't one where the two most common values are both modes. It's one where there are two distinct local maxima. The tails to the left and right must asymptotically approach zero (or you don't have a smooth distribution, because you have discontinuities somewhere), and if there's just one local maximum, your curve will look like a bell. reply commathingy 7 hours agorootparentThe exponential distribution (modal value 0) is not bell shaped.

The central limit theorem describe the distribution of the sample means from a population. It describes the distribution of the mean, not the distribution of the population itself. The shape of the distribution of the sample mean isn’t super interesting when you’re interested in the distribution of the samples themselves as a proxy for a population. So I’m not sure I understand your assertion. Could you explain more your reasoning? Maybe I’m missing something, but the estimation of the sample mean distribution isn’t the only metric that’s useful, and almost nothing in nature is normally distributed otherwise. Normal distributions are generally a useful assumption mostly because of the analytic form of the Gaussian and our understanding of how to work with it. But that estimation isn’t useful as it might seem. A Poisson distribution is much more common for instance. reply IanCal 10 hours agoparentprev> they assume that your data follows a bell/gaussian shape No they don't.

A lot of people here are commenting that no, technically box plots don't assume any distribution. And I mean, technically you can ride from NYC to SF in a lawnmower. But I completely agree that box plots shouldn't ever be used for anything but unimodal distributions similar enough to a bell/gaussian distribution. All of the criticism of the article seems to be that they're misleading when the distribution is not bell/gaussian, e.g. bimodal. To which my reply is, of course. Box plots shouldn't be used then. But if your distribution is bell/gaussian, they seem fine and I see no particular issue with them. reply treflop 10 hours agoparentprevI agree. The author simply used the wrong chart. The author's example has a bimodal distribution (TWO peaks) and chooses a type of chart that has ONE peak (a box plot). A little baffling tbh. reply rcxdude 10 hours agorootparentWell, to start with, how would you determine that about your distribution in the first place? And if that works well enough, why use a box plot afterwards? reply treflop 9 hours agorootparentWell usually when you are analyzing some data, you toss it into the most basic chart like a histogram. And a histogram for the author's example is perfectly acceptable to show that single data series. But imagine if you have 10 different normal data series and you want to compare their medians and distributions between each other... well are you going to put 10 histograms side by side and expect the reader to compare them? No -- that's where the box and whisker plot shines. reply cjk2 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause it's very hard to rationally compare multimodal batches without single test statistics. And they present five summary figures for each batch, each of which are reasonable metrics to compare batches with. reply smcin 8 hours agorootparentprevSimple, use a histogram. The author's first histogram clearly shows most of the distribution lies in [20,100), then the [10,20) bin is empty but the [0,10) bin is quite full. Hence, that's not a single-mode distribution. It has two modes, one around [50,60) and the other in [0,10). reply thaumasiotes 8 hours agorootparentprev> and chooses a type of chart that has ONE peak (a box plot) Huh? A box plot doesn't have any peaks. A box plot is a histogram subject to the constraint that every bar in the histogram is equally tall. There can never be more than zero peaks. reply Beldin 10 hours agoparentprev> Box plots [...] assume that your data follows a bell/gaussian shape. Not sure how to square that with this statement on Wikipedia's page on box plots: Box plots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution[3] reply sigmoid10 10 hours agorootparentIf you want to see why that is not fully correct you should read the article. For a box plot you need to calculate mean, variance and certain percentiles. These values don't make sense if your distribution does not follow a certain shape (because these values unambiguously define such a shape).

This thread is the first time i heard people do the \"split dataset into 4 quarters\" and using that for box plots. reply pocketsand 56 minutes agorootparentAs I'm sure you know, there are a lot of variations on how quantiles are calculated in various software. The 25th percentile, e.g., doesn't always line up with a value in the dataset, so sometimes nearest rank methods are used, otherwise a linearly interpolated data point, where interpolation is done in various ways. In any event, none of these methods assume normality, or rely on CDFs of a normal curve. If they did, every box plot would be symmetric. The fact some people think that boxplots are constructed in such a way is a pretty good reason to take the author's article seriously as for how boxplots are confusing. reply thaumasiotes 8 hours agorootparentprevArguing that nobody who might be professionally expected to look at a box plot can be reasonably expected to understand how box plots are defined doesn't make a compelling case that using them is a good idea. reply blueflow 7 hours agorootparentIf the method how the plot boxes are calculated is not clear (this thread references at least two different methods), you'll need to explicitly write it down which methods you did use. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 5 hours agorootparentprevIt is actually a fascinating argument that shows how little of what is being decided is based on actual data ( or at least our understanding of it ), but rather that data visualization is being used to push already pre-approved decisions with data being used merely as a 'for' argument.

On the other hand, the moment such lusted after summaries mislead in some way they regret the data compression. What's really going on is that people want a simplicity (often in the form of definite conclusions) which may just not exist. This is really a common malaise of the human condition. Similarly, the distribution represented by a box plot itself is often the distribution of \"just one sample\". When viewed as such, a distro has its own uncertainty[1] and that uncertainty is not represented in a violin plot, for example.

They want to see the median, the low/high percentiles, the max/min or outliers, and they don't want to see all the data points jittered in between. It's just overwhelming extraneous information. They in fact like tables with those numbers written down, but they want to compare ten different (time series of historical prices for different markets) and see it on one Powerpoint slide. The box plot allows a fast visual comparison of medians and other key percentiles (label the plot with the percentiles if you're doing something non-standard!). With jitter or violin they get hung up on weird random stuff and it derails meetings. Important caveats: the generating processes for all these quantities are the same in a physical sense, so they are comparable. All the distributions are roughly lognormal-ish, so they are single-peaked distributions, as folks are discussing here. The point of the visualization in theses cases is not to understand the properties of the distribution per se, it's to show the important percentiles because they have business implications. reply lkdfjlkdfjlg 6 hours agoparentprev> What I don't see is anyone saying \"box plots are useful because they're the best kind of chart for [specific use case]\".

These are ok but it’s hard to differentiate the density of points when they’re randomly offset. Try a swarm plot (seaborn) / bee swarm plot (R). It’s the same concept but the points are strategically placed across the x axis to show the width of the distribution at each point. It generally looks much cleaner. reply karmakaze 8 hours agoprev> There are other distribution chart types that can be useful in specific situations, such as frequency polygons, violin plots, cumulative distribution plots, and bee swarm plots, but the three types that I described above are the easiest ones to grasp, and are able to communicate most of the insights that are needed for day-to-day decision-making in most organizations. (I’m not mentioning histograms here because they’re generally only useful for visualizing a single set of values, whereas box plots and their alternatives are for visualizing multiple sets of values, which is a different use case.) There's generalizations and 'specific situations' which the author considers worthy of some plots, and other specific situations that the author doesn't consider worthy of other plots.

I.e. if the boxes are close together I will ignore a change I've made, only committing changes that provide a significant jump in performance. The box plot is a useful way of visualizing that. They can help with seeing highly variable performance (long box) from consistent performance (narrow box). I can see this in the data (mean, standard deviation) but having it represented visually can help -- especially looking at the data over several iterations, or when looking for patterns from changing a variable (like the number of items in the data being processed). I've also used linear regression calculations when data has looked linear or quadratic to check/confirm that assumption. -- You can overlay that on top of the data by computing the values for each value of n along side the actual data average and then including the average and calculated values in a line chart. reply klysm 3 hours agoprevI think there is an aversion to just showing the damn distribution as a histogram or KDE.

For example, though the final example in the reference there is graphically \"only\" shading the \"outer band\" darker than the inner alpha-blended region, this seems important statistically/visualization-wise since the unknown true parent distribution/ensemble samples are, well, sampled from need only be any monotonic curve within the whole region..

Just plotting points will lead to saturation in high density areas that depends on point size and opacity. Making bin color proportional to point density will require normalization to make the plot readable in many cases.

I think it’s the easiest, most straight forward, and not confusing to the reviewer.

I do not care much about charts in general, while I do care much about the availability of the data used to produce a chart... In way too much cases I see plots and no data, sometimes data are there but not easy to use, and another thing I do care is the ability to tweak a graph. The above are between the reasons I prefer remote meeting where data are to be shown instead of in person: anyone attending should have a computer ready to use and IF data are shared and ready usable I can live tweaks a plot ad reason on it while I listen end eventually pose relevant questions shown at my own turn something. Surely not all presentations are meant to be interactive session, but being able to interact even in async form reading a journal article, playing with the data and eventually drop a mail to the author is a nice thing, typically uselessly hard today where in tech term it can be extremely simple. That's another reason I have presentation software/office automation one instead of plain org-mode, Jupyter, R Studio etc because change things it's hard while it should be easy. Org-mode is excellent to present but not really interactive, I have to regenerate plots to see changes or push data to external software, Jupyter is not really meant to present, R Studio offer nice LaTeX integration and tabular view but do not offer nice means to present, though they are still FAR better then presentation software and even if have some safety aspects to be taken into account I prefer countless of time receiving an active document (org-mode, jupyter notebook etc) instead of a pdf or even worse some office formats. reply bdjsiqoocwk 11 hours agoprevThe author just has a bad intuition.

Can we please just move past that though? The vast vast vast majority of box plots are for “general consumption”. The vast vast majority of box plots are used in place of a more suitable chart type. You seem to be arguing that, because a box plot is hypothetically suitable for some (in the grand scheme of things) corner case, that the author’s point is faulty. I think that you are completely overstating the importance of the hypothetical ‘correct case’. You’re getting stuck on a point that nobody, least of all the author, is making. reply munch117 6 hours agoparentprev> So the diagram should not be used because of an education problem with some audiences? A problem like this one that he mentions, \"People associate longer shapes with greater quantity\", is not something you can fix by teaching. Even if you know intellectually that the association is, in this case, wrong, you can't free yourself from the association. It's hardwired into the brain. People who work with this sort of diagram a lot will eventually build up context-specific associations that work better, overriding that instinct, to the point where it feels seamless. But even if it feels seamless and easy, the dissonance is still there, and may lower your comprehension speed and slightly impair your judgment. As a statistics expert, you are never going to notice that, because your baseline comprehension speed and judgment on the subject is so good, that this very minor impairment is lost in the noise. So you may not be a good judge of the usability qualities of the diagram type. reply sloowm 7 hours agoparentprevWhy would you even use plots at all. You could just show the numbers for the 4 points represented in the box plot and people with proper education would understand. If people need diagrams it's just an education problem with some audiences. But the real education deficit shown here is psychology education. Humans are bad at doing some calculations inherently. They are not able to properly asses pie charts and easily confused by numbers with a lot of digits. Even before these studies were done people were able to come up with visualizations that were better suited for human understanding. People chose to use box plots because the visualization was better to understand by people than the numerical representation of the same information. Luckily there are now even better tools to represent the same numerical data in a way that is even better to understand. So, if you are truly educated properly you don't use visualization. reply mkl 10 hours agoparentprevWhen there are alternatives that are clearer and also don't have this education problem, why use box plots?

Sometimes you may want to highlight some core representation of data without the distraction of outliers (yes that does mean some people will use it for deliberate misrepresentation). But in this regard it's useful, as is on bar graphs not starting the vertical at 0 (because you want to illustrate relate difference not absolute amounts). reply Angostura 10 hours agorootparentThe article doesn’t really argue that they are “faulty” just that there are better alternatives in the large majority of cases.

You dismiss the problem of education as if that is free - but information is physical and spreading it takes significant amounts of time and energy, brains are what they are and hard to change, so this is so obviously a very significant problem that I don't see a basis for discussion given the context here. A forum such as this is a bad place to talk about very basic assumptions, to be able to have a useful discussion about topics such as this some minimum common understanding needs to be there. Accepting the reality of how people think and behave is rational. To answer your rhetorical question: Yes! That reason is valid. We usually only have less than a hundred comments that are useful, many more and most won't ever even see them. If we had to discuss such basics, it would be a huge waste of time, and it would be detrimental to the overall value of the discussion. That includes explaining it to the commenter. I think it is okay to make such comments less visible. In my view it's less about \"punishment\" or about annoying the writer, but about letting the other people concentrate on other comments that don't force one into side-tracked discussions about very basic things. I would suggest that you don't take it personal, we all occasionally are in that same boat. reply SillyUsername 9 hours agorootparentFair enough, it is irritating, especially as although I am not the expert the author is, I am advance qualified in this field and passionate about the \"best tool for the job\" depending on what you want to convey Vs data clarity for a general audience (which from what I now believe, is the author's point of view) reply ohmyiv 10 hours agorootparentprevPlease don't comment about the voting on comments.

    "originBody": "llama.ttf llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model. Ehm, what? llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model. Why? How? The font shaping engine Harfbuzz, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome, comes with a Wasm shaper allowing arbitrary code to be used to \"shape\" text. In particular, this \"arbitrary\" code could in principle be an entire LLM inference engine with trained parameters bundled inside, relying on treating text containing magic symbols for fake \"ligatures\" to initialize the LLM and use it to generate text. It could also in principle be an entire LLM inference engine (Llama in our case, hence the name) except instead of only being in principle it's what this is. At the end of the day, what this means is that you can just use the font to run the LLM and e.g. get text generation in any Harfbuzz-based application; your favorite text editor/email client/whatever without having to wait for the vendor to include the \"Copilot\"-like features that everyone is rushing to implement these days. And everything runs completely locally. So perhaps this silly hack is in fact a billion dollar idea!? This also means that you can use your font to chat with your font. Okay show me So in case that doesn't make sense (after all, does it?), here's an attempt to make it make more sense: Skip to 6:09 if you just want to see the font in action. Usage Just download llama.ttf (60 MB download, since it's based on the 15M parameter TinyStories-based model demoed above) and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where Harfbuzz is used and built with Wasm support. The simplest way to experiment with this is probably to build Harfbuzz with -Dwasm=enabled and build wasm-micro-runtime, then add the resulting shared libraries, libharfbuzz.so.0.60811.0 and libiwasm.so to the LD_PRELOAD environment variable before running a Harfbuzz-based application such as gedit or GIMP; no recompilation of the applications is required.

Years ago I wrangled a (modified) bug in the font rendering of Firefox [1, 2016] into an exploit (for a research paper). Short version: the Graphite2 font rendering engine in FF had/has? a stack machine that can be used to execute simple programs during font rendering. It sounded insane to me back then, but I dug into it a bit. Turns out while rendering Roman based scripts is relatively straightforward [2], there are scripts that need heavy use of ligatures etc. to reproduce correctly [3]. Using a basic scripting (heh) engine for that does make some sense. Whether this is good or bad, I have no opinion on. It is \"just\" another layer of complexity and attack surface at this point. We have programmable shaders, rowhammer, speculative execution bugs, data timing side channels, kernel level BPF scripting, prompt injection and much more. Throwing WASM based font rendering into the mix is just balancing more on top of the pile. After some years in the IT security area, I think there are so many easier ways to compromise systems than these arcane approaches. Grab the data you need from a public AWS bucket or social engineer your access, far easier and cheaper. For what it's worth, I think embedded WASM is a better idea than rolling your own eco systems for scripting capabilities. [1] https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1248876 [2] I know, there are so many edge cases. I put this in the same do not touch bucket as time and names.

Last I checked there were about 4-10 TTF bugs discovered and actively exploited per year. I think I heard those stats in 2018 or so.

Even for browsers, it took 20+ years to arrive at a combination of ugly hacks and standard practices where developers who make no mistakes in following a million arcane rules can mostly avoid the massive day-one security problems caused by JavaScript (and its interaction with other misfeatures like cookies and various cross-site nonsense). During all of which time the \"Web platform\" types were beavering away giving it more access to more things. The Worldwide Web technology stack is a pile of ill-thought-out disasters (or, for early, core architectural decisions, not-thought-out-at-all disasters), all vaguely contained with horrendous hackery. This adds to the pile. > The only output from the WASM is to draw to screen.

Assuming there are no bugs in the giant mass of code that a font can now exercise. I used to write software security standards for a living. Finding out that you could embed WASM in fonts would have created maybe two weeks of work for me, figuring out the implications and deciding what, if anything, could be done about them. Based on, I don't know, a hundred similar cases, I believe I probably would have found some practical issues. I might or might not have been able to come up with any protections that the people writing code downstream of me could (a) understand and (b) feasibly implement. Assuming I'd found any requirements-worthy response, it probably would have meant much, much more work than that for the people who at least theoretically had to implement it, and for the people who had to check their compliance. At one company. So somebody can make their kerning pretty in some obscure corner case. reply turnsout 4 hours agorootparentprevThe risk is that you could have the text content say one thing while the visual display says another. There are social engineering and phishing risks. reply xg15 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's still horrible, not in a (direct) security but in an interop sense: Now you have to embed an entire WASM engine, including proper sandboxing, just to render the font correctly. That's a huge increase of complexity and attack surface. reply simonw 3 hours agorootparentI'm hoping that in a few years time WASM sandboxes will be an expected part of how most things in general purpose computing devices work. There's very little code in the world that I wouldn't want to run in a robust sandbox. Low level OS components that manage that sandbox is about it. reply xg15 3 hours agorootparentNormalizing the complexity doesn't make it go away. Ideally, I'd like not to execute any kind of arbitrary code when doing something mundane as rendering a font. If that's not possible, then the code could be restricted to someting less than turing complete, e.g. formula evaluation (i.e. lambda calculus) without arbitrary recursion. The problem is that even sandboxed code is unpredictable in terms of memory and runtime cost and can only be statically analyzed to a limited extent (halting problem and all). Additionally, once it's there, people will bring in libraries, frameworks and sprawling dependency trees, which will further increase the computing cost and unpredictability of it. reply simonw 2 hours agorootparentThat's why I care so much about WebAssembly (and other sandbox) features that can set a strict limit on the amount of memory and CPU that the executing code can access. reply rft 2 hours agorootparentprevYour comment reminded me of this great talk [1] (humor ofc).

    "originBody": "Recently, the world’s first fully high-temperature superconducting Tokamak device, developed and constructed by Energy Singularity, known as “HH70,” has successfully achieved first plasma. HH70 has conducted discharge experiments based on two types of pre-ionization methods: localized helical magnetic flux injection (electron gun) and ion cyclotron heating (ICRF), and has successfully obtained the first plasma. The toroidal magnetic field (B0) of HH70 is 0.6 Tesla, with a plasma major radius of 0.75 meters. Its magnet system consists of 26 high-temperature superconducting magnets. Designed, developed, and constructed by Energy Singularity, HH70 has independent intellectual property rights, with a localization rate exceeding 96%. The completion and operation of HH70 have taken the lead in the world in completing the engineering feasibility verification of high-temperature superconducting Tokamak, marking that China has gained a first-mover advantage in the key field of high-temperature superconducting magnetic confinement fusion. At the same time, the research and construction of HH70 have also achieved a number of innovative results: The world’s first high-temperature superconducting magnetic confinement fusion device. The world’s first high-temperature superconducting Tokamak. The world’s first superconducting Tokamak built by a commercial company. One of the four superconducting Tokamaks in operation worldwide. The successful discharge of HH70 signifies that Energy Singularity has become the first and currently the only team in the world to build and operate a fully high-temperature superconducting Tokamak, as well as the first and currently the only commercial company to build and operate a fully superconducting Tokamak. Starting from the completion and operation of HH70, and taking HH70 as a key experimental platform, we will invest in the development of the next generation of high-field high-temperature superconducting Tokamak devices—HH170, which aims to achieve a deuterium-tritium equivalent energy gain (Q) greater than 10. Controlled nuclear fusion is expected to provide humanity with an almost infinite, clean, and cheap source of energy, and is considered the ultimate energy solution. As the only magnetic confinement fusion technology route that has completed scientific feasibility verification, the Tokamak has always been the focus of global controlled nuclear fusion research and development. High-temperature superconducting Tokamak combines robust physics with engineering innovation, which is expected to greatly improve the cost-effectiveness of the device and accelerate the commercialization of fusion energy, and has become the direction of fusion energy research and development that attracts the most market-oriented funding worldwide. As a domestic institution that took the lead in focusing on the research and development of high-temperature superconducting Tokamak, since its establishment in 2021, Energy Singularity has taken “accelerating the realization of human energy freedom” as its mission, adhering to the values of “extreme efficiency and seeking truth from facts”, and has established an integrated high-temperature superconducting magnet design, processing, and testing platform, and built the capabilities for research and development, design, construction, and operation of high-temperature superconducting Tokamak devices.",

Better to bet on Shakespeare and Aristotle, than e.e.cummings and T.S. Eliot A word coined in the 1970s won’t be nearly as entrenched in its meaning with the public as an older word.

Shutting down a particle accelerator (either temporarily or permanently) is way easier than shutting down a fission pile, because a particle accelerator or fusion reactor would just dump the plasma into a graphite bed and dump the stored magnetic field energy into a bunch of large copper bars acting as big resistors. EDIT: If you shot a hole in a fusion reactor, the cold air would immediately quench the plasma down to room temperature. https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/nrc-decision-separ...

However, because the tech was '50 years away', it never made sense for private sector investors, so most investment was from governments. However, with solar and wind now far cheaper than nuclear due to no need for massive capital investments in concrete and steel upfront many years before production starts, does it even make sense for governments to go down this route? reply ufmace 21 hours agoparentAFAIK it's not at all clear that solar and wind are really cheaper when making up a substantial part of a large-scale power grid that meets our current expectations of 100% consistent and reliable power everywhere, no matter what. The unreliability of solar and wind requires either hot (constantly running and spinning) non-renewable backups or grid-scale power storage (has never been done so ? on cost to build and upkeep) to guarantee reliable voltage and AC frequency. The cost of that should be factored into determine the true cost of these power sources. The stability of the grid is dependent on the collective physical inertia of the many tens of thousands of huge and heavy spinning turbine-generator sets that make up the majority of the current generating capacity. Most current solar power sources rely on grid-following inverters, which are not stable without a grid stabilized by a preponderance of large spinning turbines. There has been some work on grid-forming inverters that are less impacted by this, but AFAIK there aren't currently any that can replicate the grid stability provided by that physical inertia. I'm less certain about wind turbines, but I think they have this problem too. I don't think they're controllable enough to be mechanically synced to the grid frequency. I'd love to be wrong about this, please prove me so if you can! But I don't often hear these points addressed, and we're not helping anything by ignoring the complexity of the real world. reply epistasis 20 hours agorootparentInverters can easily replace physical inertia, it just requires technology developed within the past 30 years, and most grid folks haven't thought about new technology for far longer than that. As more and more intermittent renewables get pushed onto grids, they become more reliable. Most outages are from single points of failure from large generators or transmission. Dealing with highly distributed renewables means that grid ops get used to acting fast, and there's greater redundancy instead of so many SPOF. Kind of how cloud services got reliable by expecting there to be failure and designing it into the system. Storage is advancing super quickly, is super fast to deploy, and can replace a lot of more expensive things like transmission upgrades. We have all the tech to replace fossil fuels on the grid with the above. The only question is the final cost. It's likely to be far far lower than using existing \"hard\" energy, because by the time we can deploy 50 TWhs of storage, it will have gotten so cheap. We don't know when costs will stabilize, but they have a loooong distance to fall. And we have all sorts of other technologies that will make all this far cheaper: enhanced geothermal, enhanced geothermal with temporal storage based on injection pressure and release, iron air batteries, flow batteries, thermal storage for industrial process heat, etc. etc. etc. For every area of the energy economy, there are two to three solutions that look promising. Fusion and fission look promising for none. That's not to say that they can't have some serious innovation and start dropping their costs, but nobody currently operating in the field has demonstrated a path. Yet. reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparent> As more and more intermittent renewables get pushed onto grids, they become more reliable This is called grid firming, and it’s massively expensive. reply epistasis 17 hours agorootparentI don't think that's the same thing, but what expenses are you thinking of specifically? The German grid for example got much more reliable with additional solar. reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparentGrids were designed to operate in tight tolerances. Cycling power levels up and down a lot, while handling the frequency variation lots of renewables inputs bring, wears down the grid without protective measures. Those measures are called firming [1]. Not sure what Germany did (or plans to do—you can run an unfirmed grid until stuff starts failing for several years). [1] https://www.gevernova.com/gas-power/applications/grid-firmin... reply epistasis 12 hours agorootparent\"Capacity firming\" will be carried out by legacy gas turbines as they run less and less, and eventually by batteries. Batteries are also much better than gas at frequency regulation, and even at the prices a decade ago, completely took over the market for frequency regulation in the PJM market in the US. But frequency regulation is very very tiny in terms of power needs, it only takes a very small number of grid batteries to completely solve that problem. The amount of batteries waiting in the interconnection queue completely dwarfs gas. There will be no \"firming\" coming from new gas turbines, unless old-school corrupt utilities are able to sneak it by PUCs by creating some sort of crisis and tricking them. reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agorootparent> \"Capacity firming\" will be carried out by legacy gas turbines as they run less and less, and eventually by batteries At least among the American TSOs, there are zero I know of that plan to do this. Do you have a source for one that does? Trillions have already been spent on gas. That infrastructure will need to earn its return through the 2040s at the very least, and that precludes running them exclusively for firming. To the extent retrofits are being discussed, it’s as an add-on amidst full peaked functionality. > Batteries are also much better than gas at frequency regulation Limiting solar and wind by utility-scale battery capacity means scaling back EV adoption or solar and wind deployment.

The current grid is built on early 20th century principles, before we had real-time digital communications. As a though experiment - imagine a 19th century world suddenly getting all of our current digital tech and wind farms and solar power - there would be no point in trying to create a \"static\" grid where producers and consumers weren't communicating with each other.

Even better, Australian government was super against the change, but now most places are positive on them because of the obvious success. reply deff 19 hours agorootparentprevRegarding stability, this physical inertia is also present in rotating wind turbines. But I guess exploiting this at a meaningful scale would recquire a level of interconnectivity which boils down to the same issue of cost. I am however optimistic about grid-scale storage. There is a long term trend of rapidly dropping battery prices, and with recent developments in sodium ion batteries there is no fundamental reason this won´t continue. Another enabler could be advancements in lifespan. This could allow storage being installed inside or near wind and PV, cutting down on space and installation costs. Even then however, grid improvements would be needed. Some problems still need to be solved indeed, but in my (mostly uneducated) opinion, they seem easier than achieving economically viable fusion.

Solar or wind + utility-scale storage come in at 46 to 102 and 42 to 114 $/MWh, respectively, in terms of LCOE [1]. That does not include grid firming costs [2], which could raise the upper end of those figures to $120 or more, and is based on current storage prices; if everyone tries to build at once, it rises. (On the other hand, there are further economies of scale to be realised.) Fission clocks in around 141 to 221 $/MWh, which is why we aren’t building it, but $31 at the margin, which is why closing working plants is stupid. SMR focus on lowering capital costs through economies of scale. Fusion by reducing compliance costs. In all likelihood, the solution is fusion SMRs baseloading solar, wind and geothermal energy with peaker industrial processes running during the day. (Hydro can come too.)

Tokamaks are well understood, they supposedly have the same plasma physics as ITER which has been heavily scrutinized and supported by work at JET, and their concept is simple - Tokamak but with very high field superconducting magnets using technology that wasn’t available when ITER was conceived, and apparently higher field strengths mean a smaller reactor for the same power gains. As a lay person the story is simple and that’s good! Then they demonstrated their magnets and got $2B in funding and now they’re deep in the construction phase for SPARC. I encourage anyone curious to look up videos on SPARC on YouTube. It’s very encouraging! It seems honestly very reasonable that they will see sustained net energy gain for their entire power plant before 2030 (tho SPARC is still a demonstrator not designed for continuous service, so “sustained” means like one minute).

Liquid methane is essentially the same as LNG, which is rapidly becoming the most popular fuel for newbuild ships today. But it's about as environmentally friendly as building natural gas powerplant to replace coal - a temporary solution at best. Future solutions need a carbon-free fuel, period. reply cyberax 1 hour agorootparentThere's nothing wrong with CO2 emissions, as long as they remain carbon-neutral. So if you capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and then use it to synthesize methanol or methane, then there are no problems with that. Methanol is slightly preferred because methane can leak, and it's a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. However, even most of the CH4 leaks happen near the drilling wells, and in pipelines.

It's useless. It can only produce low-grade industrial heat. If you have spare electricity (from any source), it's easy.

Ammonia was used to power buses during the WWII, diesels can burn pretty much anything that burns (within reason). It's not a problem of technical feasibility. Ammonia fueling infrastructure does not exist, and its failure scenarios are just not going to be acceptable. Meanwhile, LNG fueling infrastructure is rapidly getting built out. What's worse, ammonia is also produced from natural gas, it's used for process heat and as a hydrogen source. There's pretty much no \"green ammonia\". So instead of round-tripping through ammonia production, it's easier to just burn the LNG directly. In future, we can switch to green ammonia, but then we also can use power-to-gas or power-to-methanol instead. Both are more efficient than ammonia synthesis. Methanol production, in particular, can potentially scale down to very small facilities. In theory, large utility-scale solar or wind farms can have a methanol synthesizer unit, that will produce it when there's more electricity when needed. It can then be transported by regular tanker trucks. reply credit_guy 21 hours agorootparentprevExactly. Proliferation will always be a risk with nuclear reactors. We will never have nuclear powered civilian ships, as long as there exist pirates out there.

As for hydrogen, I think ships are the killer app. High pressure tanks or cryogenic tanks benefit from the square-cube law. If you want them to be economical, they need to be really large.

Edit: finger slipped and hit post too early, so a bit was added, apologies! reply vbezhenar 21 hours agorootparentprevWhy is it impossible to use wind and solar for ships? I mean, most of our history, ships used wind. reply wongarsu 19 hours agorootparentSails are great, but they are incompatible with the way we load and unload ships now. Ports are designed around unobstructed access from the top. Maybe you could make it work with tankers, but people are risk averse with those. Also sail ships need a lot of crew to handle the sails. Some shipping companies are experimenting with other ways to use wind. You can deploy kites to pull the ship, but that brings some operational challenges. The more promising idea are probably flettner rotors [1]. Those look like big spinning columns and work on the Magnus effect (how wind puts a 90 degree force on spinning objects). Their limited footprint makes them easy to integrate into existing designs, and since all they do is spin they are easy to use with the small crews of todays ships. All of those modern ideas are mostly for reducing fuel consumption though, not replacing the engine entirely. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_ship reply londons_explore 21 hours agorootparentprevI suspect we're quite close to ships switching to wind simply because it's cheaper. Huge kilometer square kites would be pretty cheap compared to the fuel budget of a ship, and clever routing and control systems can probably mean they reduce fuel consumption 80% for the same travel speed. reply vlovich123 21 hours agorootparent> The kite in question has been named Seawing, and may help ships reduce their fuel emissions by between 10 and 40 percent Not KM but 822m seems pretty close. I think you’re grossly overestimating the benefit from the kite. Seating’s current website says: > A 1000m² sail surface to harness the power of the wind and tow ships. Based on modelling and preliminary land-based tests, Airseas estimates that the Seawing system can reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 20%. I don’t think better routing will increase that to 80% even if you combine it with next gen tech that knows wave patterns and when a slot will be available to minimize speed and energy loss.

Besides producing plutonium for nuclear bombs, it is also easy to use a fusion reactor to produce any kind of dangerous radioactive isotopes that could be used in terrorist activities.

That's what the UK does. Their cost is pretty much proportional to their utilisation so it makes sense to switch them on and off. You also have hydro but it's a fairly limited (there are only so many valleys you can flood and so much water you can capture - plus historically it's the source of energy that killed the most people). But if you truly decarbonise, and in absence of an economical way to store vast amounts of energy for a long time (wind can be down to pretty much zero for weeks on a typical year), and I don't see any such facility being built at scale, I am not sure what else than nuclear you can use to compensate for the volatility of wind. And because nuclear costs the same whether you use it or not, you then might as well save yourself the construction of a wind farm. That's why I don't understand why we are spending billions building those gigantic wind farms. They only make sense if the intention is to keep using carbon.

Also, very dumb question but the plasma means that fusion is actually occuring, right? And does anyone know how this one collects the heat and converts it into electricity or whatever? Or any other fusion device, how does it actually collect or output energy from the fusion. And how much do they make, and how far off is that from matching the input power? Maybe it was some protons escaping from the plasma and hearing something external or something. reply __MatrixMan__ 22 hours agoparent1. Yes, sorta, but it's more than just the magnetic field. You're also heating the fuel, so you have to offset that too. Plus there are pumps which circulate coolant to carry heat away from the plasma and towards a turbine, so you have to offset their power. Probably a few other things as well. 2. I don't think plasma == fusion. You can get plasma just by heating a gas beyond a certain point. Plasma cutters, for instance, operate on super heated air, no fusion anywhere nearby. 3. I think the wall of the reaction chamber heats up because they're being bombarded by radiation. Most of the radiation incident on the reaction chamber walls is infrared, radiated from the hot plasma, but there are also more exotic things like stray neutrons also crash into the sides of the thing. These cause the metal to deteriorate over time (and become somewhat hazardous), but they also they impart additional heat energy. So you have to have two cooling systems, one to keep the magnets actually cold so they they remain superconducting, and another to keep the housing below the point where it melts. It's this second one that let's you pull heat away from the hot metal donut that is a tokomak and use it to make electricity. Between the magnet coolant and the chamber coolant and the reacting plasma you have some of the steepest thermal gradients anywhere in the known universe. reply ilaksh 22 hours agorootparentThanks..right I know about plasma in general, I just assumed in this case it was caused by the fusion. Maybe not. But they have fusion right? Just not recovering any/enough energy to make up for power requirements. reply SeanAnderson 22 hours agorootparentThe article is light on details. It doesn't mention an operating temperature or Q factor. I would hazard to guess that no - they did not achieve fusion. They achieved plasma which is a precursor to fusion. Controlled plasma, at a high enough temperature, is an environment in which fusion can occur. All this article says is they created controlled plasma. Crucially, they did so with high temperature magnets which is fairly novel. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_energy_gain_factor You might also be interested in reading this. Q factor is what's used to discuss whether a fusion device is generating net positive energy. reply pfdietz 22 hours agorootparentNo tokamak, even one intended to achieve fusion, would first be operated on D or DT. They'd first extensively test it with ordinary hydrogen. reply johnbcoughlin 21 hours agorootparentprevI doubt they have achieved any fusion reactions. They don't state any numbers on density or temperature so it's impossible to know. But in general plasma is never \"caused by\" fusion. Creating a plasma is quite easy compared to getting it hot and dense enough to fuse. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentI'm musing about the phrase: > plasma is never \"caused by\" fusion Which do you suppose comes first in a gravitational confinement scenario, plasma or fusion? It sorta seems like a chicken/egg scenario. I mean you gotta get those electrons out of the way, but where does he heat come from to do that, if not fusion? reply willis936 7 hours agorootparentDefinitely plasma. Look at star formation in nebulae. Most of the hydrogen in them are in glow mode plasma. It takes a very small amount of energy to ionize plasma and a a huge amount to fuse it. So when stars are forming they might start as cold hydrogen, but they get progressively warmer and more dense until they ionize, then get even warmer and more dense, until they're burning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation reply cyberax 21 hours agorootparentprevThey likely can have some fusion reactions (if they use fusible fuel, like D-D). Fusion is not that hard to achieve, you can do that on a table-top scale (Farnsworth Fusion). reply pfdietz 22 hours agoparentprev> Dumb question, but is the basic idea that you need to harvest more heat energy from the plasma than is needed to maintain the magnetic field? No, since creating and maintaining the magnetic field in principle consumes no energy. All the energy put into a superconducting magnet (1/2 L I^2) can be recovered. What is needed from a physics point of view is for fusion energy production to comfortably exceed the energy put into the plasma. And there's also a whole host of engineering and economic issues beyond that. Energy is recovered from DT fusion by stopping the neutrons in a blanket, converting their energy to heat, and taking that heat away in a fluid. reply magicalhippo 20 hours agoparentprev> plasma means that fusion is actually occuring, rigth? As mentioned plasma is just another state of matter[1], where a significant portion of the electrons and ions a separate rather than combined as atoms. Fusion happens when you overcome the electrostatic repulsion of nuclei, bringing them close enough together so they can fuse[2]. Typically, in reactors like this, that means you confine (compress) a sufficient amount of material (\"fuel\") to a small volume and heat it up sufficiently. Both are needed to make it possible for the nuclei to come close enough to fuse. The heat required is so great the material will turn into a plasma. > And does anyone know how this one collects the heat and converts it into electricity or whatever? This depends somewhat on reactor design, including fuel used. However they're all fancy steam generators in the end, so not unlike a traditional nuclear power plant in that regard. From what I know, typically the \"surplus heat\" of a fusion reactor comes in the form of energetic neutron radiation[3]. This radiation is ionizing and as such shielding is required, and this shielding will heat up as it slows down those energetic neutrons. In the ARC reactor[4] for example, a liquid shielding \"blanket\" surrounds the fusion chamber. As the neutrons heats up the liquid, the liquid gets pumped through a heat exchanger to produce steam to run a steam turbine. edit: I found this talk[5] from one of the folks behind ARC to be very illuminating in how fusion power works and the challenges involved. It's from 2017, but the basics haven't changed.

So the question is, how do you collect enough heat without melting key components? reply baq 22 hours agorootparentNo unless you want your turbine to be neutron activated. (You don't.) You would pump water through the reactor and use a heat exchanger to a secondary water loop which powers the turbine. Maybe you can do without the secondary loop altogether, not sure; this ITER document suggests only one loop, but it's super vague: https://www.iter.org/sci/MakingitWork reply lazide 17 hours agorootparentNo one has figured out how to actually do this yet. Which is why it is vague. The radiation levels and difficulty maintaining the magnetic confinement make this essentially impossible right now. Another reason why fusion is always 50 years away. It’s really hard (outside of a nuclear bomb or star, anyway). reply willis936 6 hours agoparentprevGreat questions. The difference between energy harvested and the energy necessary to maintain confinement is the difference in denominators of Qscientific and Qengineering. Q is power out / power in. Qscientific is a figure of merit used to know close to a burning plasma a machine is (how many fusion reactions it can do vs. how many it would need to do to be a working reactor). Qengineering is power put on the grid / parasitic power needed to keep the machine running. Every electrical power source has an analogous concept (keep the lights on, fuel pumped, inverters operating, etc.) There are some noisy non-experts who claim that focusing on Qplasma is deceitful, but it's akin to complaining that engineers are focusing on engine efficiency instead of car efficiency before the engineers have finished making the engine. At the end of the day the scale of parasitic loads scales much less than the power output of a reactor, so the reactor size chosen will be at the economic minimum between \"bigger machine is more expensive to make\" and \"smaller machine produces less power / lower Qengineering / other difficult scaling law things like neutron bombardment on plasma facing components (maintenance schedule)\". https://x.com/JB_Fusion/status/1506964692627034118 Yes, to have a real measure of Q you need to be doing fusion. In many research cases not a lot of fusion is happening and the neutrons are not actively being measured. What is typically done is to measure plasma performance metrics with protium or deuterium then say what the Q would have been if they used deuterium-tritium based on known plasma-performance to Q conversions (Lawson criterion). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion https://x.com/swurzel/status/1534556521744457731 Heat collection is done via neutrons. In D-T fusion 80% of the energy is released as a 14.1 MeV (17% speed of light, like a bat out of hell). The remaining 20% of energy is an acceleration of a He4 nucleus (fused byproduct). This He4 nucleus is a charged particle, so it stays in magnetic confinement and imparts its energy on fuel via collisions, helping to self sustain the reaction. The neutron has no charge so it flys straight out of the machine. You can model this as a small ring on the innermost core of the donut shooting neutrons in all directions. So you wrap a neutron-absorbing blanket around the vacuum vessel to slow these neutrons down via collision and heat up coolant in the blanket. You run this coolant through a heat exchanger to make pressurized steam to spin a turbine to... you get the idea. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium%E2%80%9... reply Havoc 17 hours agoprevSilly question but say fusion works and we use massive amounts of it.

If it displaced all remaining coal and natural gas burning, temperatures would stabilize. reply ranger207 17 hours agoparentprevNo. Assuming it's using steam generators like most powerplants (gas, nuclear, and coal), then the only heat released to the atmosphere would be the inevitable entropic losses. This is the same amount of heat lost by nuclear powerplants (although you could argue nuke plants release decay heat that fusion plants wouldn't but that's negligible).

US has always been more interested in inertial fusion (i.e. shoot it with lasers). Likely because of synergy with military application of lasers. The thing it, inertial confinement seems to be a dead end and has been for quite a while. At least rest of the world has decided to fund magnetic confinement (plus few oddballs with z-pinch), so I assume it's more promising approach. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://whynothugo.nl/journal/2024/06/13/ssh-as-a-sudo-replacement/",
    "originBody": "A major caveat in tools like sudo and doas for that matter is that they rely on setuid binaries and privilege escalation in order to run commands as root. The design is not ideal, and also drags in a few limitations: The whole user session needs to retain capabilities to perform privilege escalation. They don’t work when running an entire user session in a restricted user namespace. setuid binaries limitations on how the whole system is secured. An interesting alternative with a is s6-sudod, which splits the program into two parts: a privileged server and an unprivileged client. This is a summary of an experiment from a few weeks ago where I experimented with using ssh locally to perform the same role as sudo, without exposing this sshd instance to the network. Goals [permalink] Enable authorised users (and only authorised users) to run commands as root. Don’t use privilege escalation. Implementation [permalink] First, I configured a dedicated SSH key that will be authorised for authentication as root. This key is not in the regular authorized_keys file, but in a separate file which will only be used for this purpose: mkdir /root/.ssh/ echo ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... > /root/.ssh/local_keys I then ran an sshd server instance bound to a unix domain socket. Permissions are tightened so unauthorised users cannot even access the socket. This instance overrides the PermitRootLogin option to enable logging in as root1 and uses the newly created /root/.ssh/local_keys as a source for authorised keys: mkdir /run/sshd/ chown root:wheel /run/sshd/ chmod 750 /run/sshd/ s6-ipcserver /run/sshd/sshd.sock sshd -ie -o AuthorizedKeysFile=/root/.ssh/local_keys -o PermitRootLogin=yes The root account was locked to disallow logging in via any mechanism. This was done by prefixing the password’s hash with ! (so no password’s hash can ever match this value). sshd interprets this special prefix as the account being locked and won’t allow logging in as root. I changed the root password in /etc/passwd and replaced the ! with an *. sshd won’t give new value any special interpretation, and will allow logging in as root. The value * will never match the hash of any password either, so logging in via password remains effectively disabled.2 I then needed to connect to the local sshd instance. While sshd has a -i flag which allows passing an existing socket to it, ssh has no equivalent flag. The ProxyCommand option can be (ab)used for this: ssh -o ProxyCommand='socat STDIO UNIX-CONNECT:/run/sshd/sshd.sock' \\ -i .ssh/root-key.pub \\ -t \\ root@root \\ \"cd $(pwd); '$SHELL' --login\" I’m using a hardware-bound SSH key in this case, which means that I need to tap the physical device to authorise this connection. I could also use an ssh-agent that requires explicit approval before disclosing keys (e.g.: hissh-agent). A little caveat here is that socat will read all input from ssh, and then write it into the socket, effectively duplicating the overhead of the connection. I read the relevant manual pages a few more times, and couldn’t find a solution. I came across ProxyUseFdpass, but wasn’t entirely sure how to make it work. After some more research online (and some major frustration), I found a clear usage example from 2016. It turnes out that ProxyUseFdpass was quite straightforward and allows me to specify a command that sends the socket file descriptor (via stdout) to ssh, and ssh then connects over this socket. I saved the following script into /home/hugo/tmp/passfd.py: #!/usr/bin/env python3 # From: https://www.gabriel.urdhr.fr/2016/08/07/openssh-proxyusefdpass/ import sys import socket import array # Create the file descriptor: s = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.connect(\"/run/sshd/sshd.sock\") # Pass the file descriptor: fds = array.array(\"i\", [s.fileno()]) ancdata = [(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SCM_RIGHTS, fds)] socket.socket(fileno = 1).sendmsg([b'\\0'], ancdata) And the command to connect to ssh now becomes: ssh -o ProxyCommand='/home/hugo/tmp/passfd.py' \\ -i .ssh/root-key.pub \\ -o ProxyUseFdpass=yes \\ -t \\ root@root \\ \"cd $(pwd); '$SHELL' --login\" The linked article mentioned using nc (for a somewhat different use case). Initially, it would seem that nc -FU /run/sshd/sshd.sock would work, but the manual page actually specifies that this is not supported: -FPass the first connected socket using sendmsg(2) to stdout and exit. This is useful in conjunction with -X to have nc perform connection setup with a proxy but then leave the rest of the connection to another program (e.g. ssh(1) using the ssh_config(5) ProxyUseFdpass option). Cannot be used with -c or -U. Conclusion [permalink] This technique works. It relies mainly on OpenSSH for all the sensitive security details. Not only does OpenSSH have a great track record, but it also enables various forms of authentication including using a hardware-based SSH key. Configuring this on a new host has no complex steps, and the above ipcserver command can just be executed via the system’s service manager. The above passfd.py script is a quick hack to move the experiment forward; for daily usage it would be best to write a tiny executable that does the same thing and put it into /usr/local/bin. The whole ssh command could also be placed in a tiny wrapper. I didn’t edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config because I don’t want to enable logging in as root over the network-bound sshd instance. It still contains the usual PermitRootLogin no. ↩︎ I have PasswordAuthentication no in my sshd_config anyway; it is always a good idea to disable password-based authentication for sshd. ↩︎",

    "commentBody": "SSH as a Sudo Replacement (whynothugo.nl)201 points by legobeet 19 hours agohidepastfavorite102 comments kelnos 15 hours agoMy main objection to this is just the added complexity. Instead of a single suid binary that reads a config file and calls exec(), now you have one binary that runs as root and listens on a UNIX socket, and another that talks to a UNIX socket; both of them have to do asymmetric crypto stuff. It seems like the main argument against sudo/doas being presented is that you have a suid binary accessible to any user, and if there's a bug in it, an unauthorized user might be able to use it for privilege escalation. If that's really the main issue, then you can: chgrp wheel /usr/bin/sudo chmod o-rwx /usr/bin/sudo Add any sudoers to the wheel group, and there you go: only users that can sudo are allowed to even read the bytes of the file off disk, let alone execute them. This essentially gives you the same access-related security as the sshd approach (the UNIX socket there is set up to be only accessible to users in wheel), with much much much less complexity. And since the sshd approach doesn't allow you to restrict root access to only certain commands (like sudo does), even if there is a bug in sudo that allows a user to bypass the command restrictions, that still gives no more access than the sshd approach. If you are worried about your system package manager messing up the permissions on /usr/bin/sudo, you can put something in cron to fix them up that runs every hour or whatever you're comfortable with. Or you can uninstall sudo entirely, and manually install it from source to some other location. Then you have to maintain and upgrade it, manually, of course, unfortunately. reply tankenmate 8 hours agoparentPersonally I use etckeeper[0] to make sure all changes to /etc are tracked, either by software installs / upgrades, or done by humans.

That's very sensible, I wonder why it's not the default setup everywhere. reply kelnos 11 hours agorootparentProbably because there's nothing that says only users in wheel (assuming your OS/distro even has that group; some don't) can sudo.

It's even configurable if you haven't enabled PAM by configuring `SU_WHEEL_ONLY` in your login.defs. And with PAM you configure that via PAM. Hell, not even GNU distros like GNU Guix, Parabola, nor Trisquel follow RMS' opinions on this anymore. reply ilius2 8 hours agorootparentNot all distros use `alias su='sudo -i'`. Ubuntu does.

I have used sudo a lot of times to allow a specific user to run exactly one command with elevated rights. In those cases they weren't in the wheel group. reply riedel 11 hours agorootparentActually retristricting defined commands to defined sudoers should be one of the main use cases of sudo. This could be done as well via ssh config but one would need a lot of keys if you don not want a wrapper (and rewrite sudo all over) If you are really thinking security, elevating a standard user seems bad practice to anyways. It is rather I guess a way to protect the user to do `rm -rf /` accidentally. On the other end adding an another layer of obscurity is practically adding a bit of security against script kiddies. But if that is of concern one could also rename the sudo binary. One last thing the SSH trick might be interesting is the portability but in this case I would rather go via a standard TCP socket. reply jkhanlar 12 hours agorootparentprevHas anyone prepared a list of distributions indicating the default sudo setup comparing to each other?

There's a new tool in systemd, called \"run0\".

But with one key difference: it's *not* in fact SUID. Instead it just asks the service manager to invoke a command or shell under the target user's UID. It allocates a new PTY for that, and then shovels data back and forth from the originating TTY and this PTY. Or in other words: the target command is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the client (well, admittedly, we *do* propagate $TERM, but that's an explicit exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist).

You've fallen for the FUD. In reality, logging in directly as root over remote SSH is strictly more secure than logging in as user over remote SSH and then using `sudo`. If user@home uses ssh to root@server, then root@server is only compromised if user@home is compromised. If user@home uses ssh to user@server then sudo to root@server, then root@server is compromised if either user@home or user@server is compromised. In particular, it is fairly common for user@server to be running some other software such as daemons or cronjobs. Please don't give out free root escalation (and often lateral movement due to password reuse) to anyone who manages to infect through those! (This of course does not apply if sudo is used in whitelisted-commands-only mode and does not take either passwords or credentials fully accessible from the remote host) reply cycomanic 15 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I agree with this argument. Sure you can say theoretically it's one less account that could be compromised, but in practice I see a bunch of caveats. 1. If we allow password based logins, there will be many orders of magnitude more login attempts to root than any other user. So if you have to allow password based logins, you pretty much never want to allow root login. 2. If we disallow password based logins, a user account would be as save as a root login, except again that the root account is the much more valuable target so will get much more attention. I also do see the relevance of cronjobs (root does run them as well) and naturally no user that has sudo privileges should be be running network exposed services. 3. In cases were admin rights have to be shared amongst multiple users, are you going to share the same key for all users (probably not a good idea) or give every user a separate key (making key management a bit of a nightmare, user management is much easier). 4.

Almost everything I have that's multi-tenant at this point is k8s and you can just use kubectl endpoint instead of ssh. But if you're allowed to log in, you're allowed to setuid to root. So for a k8s box, that's the platform infra team and access to the services on top is through the k8s permissions provider. For the platform infra teams, if you just need something like metrics and logs, that's already off box. If you need to trigger some job or workflow, you can use the pipeline. But when someone does log in and do root stuff, I want to have an audit log. I actually can't think of a single box I own where someone with a login doesn't also have root for everything. Obviously, I understand the services doing setuid thing, but in the case of services, you generally have systemd doing setuid to drop permissions instead of the other way around. reply gizmo686 13 hours agoparentprevIf you have access to the bootloadet, you can still set systems.unit=emergency.target, or init=/bin/bash, or rd.break=pre-pivot, or boot into a live-cd environment. All of the normal emergency options work. For less fatal emergencies, I don't see anything that would tie this instance of sshd to tge network. reply hernantz 18 hours agoprevThis is a similar idea to run0 by Systemd: https://news.itsfoss.com/systemd-run0/ reply ape4 2 hours agoparentAnd run0 isn't roll-your-own. Its audited and probably better than home grown. reply iroddis 18 hours agoprevI think it’s a bit remiss to not include all of the downsides of this approach. sudo allows control over which groups can exercise which commands, what args those commands accept, subshell spawns, etc, etc, etc. This approach loses a lot of this fine-grained control, and also relies on trusted keys, which are harder to manage than editing a sudoers file. To see all the amazing things that sudo can do, I’d really recommend the Sudo Mastery book. reply yjftsjthsd-h 18 hours agoparentSSH can do some of that with ForceCommand, though I agree that's not as flexible/precise. reply TacticalCoder 16 hours agoprev100 000 times yes: I do something similar and I described that here on HN in a comment / comments in the past! The way I do is a bit different... I'm using a dedicated machine as my physical \"SSH console\" and that machine is living on a private LAN which is separated from the rest of the machines at home. It's on an unmanaged switch, using ethernet cables (but no trunk). Then the only way to login is using SSH but, here's a little spin... with a Yubikey. The desktop PC has its own firewall, only accepting SSH traffic in from the IP / MAC address of my \"SSH console\" (on the private LAN it's sharing with the SSH console... On the other physical LAN, my desktop can access the Internet). Then the sshd daemon is configured to only allow pub/priv key logins, no password logins. So basically when I need root, I boot up my \"SSH console\" (which boots ultra quickly for there's basically nothing on that machine), log in, hit the up arrow to get back the \"ssh root@...\" line, hit enter, press the Yubikey. That \"ssh console\" and its keyboard is on my desk, always withing reaching distance. iptables/nftables (on a private LAN moreover, physically separated from the other private LAN) + sshd: you judge if this is more or less secure than sudo binaries / su. As to the \"why\", I'd answer \"because I can\". I did set that up such a long time ago that I don't even remember when I did. I think I started toying with that idea two years ago and I've been using it ever since. Zero problem. Not a single issue. reply r4indeer 14 hours agoparentSounds like what you have is similar to the idea of a bastion host, even if not quite the same. reply mise_en_place 17 hours agoprevThis is an elegant solution to the problem. We don't need to treat users as children, but at the same time we should avoid potential foot guns with sensible defaults. I'd argue that even `su` is not needed, if you need to be root, then login as root via console. This is as close as possible to logging into root from the console tty. reply bogantech 16 hours agoparent> if you need to be root, then login as root via console 1: This requires every user to have the root password, while sudo does not 2: If everyone just logs in as root there's no way to audit who actually logged in and did what. reply joveian 6 hours agorootparentYou can have multiple accounts with uid/gid 0 (and can set up smart card or u2f login too if you want). reply kchr 7 hours agorootparentprevAdditionally, you need to rotate and distribute the new root password to all root users when you want to remove access for someone. reply dheera 23 minutes agoprev> I changed the root password If you're going to set a root password, you might as well just do this and if I'm not mistaken it accomplishes everything you want alias sudo=\"su -c\" reply the8472 8 hours agoprevOne of the issues with ssh is that spawning processes isn't part of the protocol. And it's a remote protocol, so it can't pass local resources to the child. So you can't pass a null-separated array of arguments, pass extra file descriptors or specify an executable. Instead it just passes a string to a server-configured shell. So you need to shell-escape things and know which shell is running on the server side. To use SSH as a proper sudo replacement it'd need something closer to posix_spawn as an extension. reply jwilk 1 hour agoparentBug report about the shell indirection: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2283 reply tankenmate 8 hours agoprevOne issue I see with this is Single User Mode (aka recovery mode in grub (or similar) boot loader). Now you can't login as root to recover from init (systemd) configuration issues without having alternate boot media to get you access. I know it might sound pedantic but I used just this feature two days ago while upgrading a machine to a newer Linux release (the upgrade introduced an issue with the systemd / netplan config that got systemd into a loop due to deprecated keywords in the netplan config). reply joveian 7 hours agoparentIf you want traditional single user mode that drops you to a root shell even though your root account is locked add SYSTEMD_SULOGIN_FORCE=1 to the environment of rescue.service and emergency.service (systemctl edit rescue.service).

These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. We show that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.

I'm not quite sure this follows. At the very least, I think they should also consider the possibility of social contagion: if some of your colleagues start using a new word in work-related writing, you usually pick that up. The spread of \"delve\" was certainly bootstrapped by ChatGPT, but I'm not sure that the use of LLMs is the only possible explanation for its growing popularity. Even in the pre-ChatGPT days, it was common for a new term to come out of nowhere and then spread like a wildfire in formal writing. \"Utilize\" for \"use\", etc. reply lm28469 7 hours agoparentI have friends in academia (all around Europe and in different fields, from Spain to Danemark, Slovakia, Sweden, Germany, in economics, solid state physics, &c.), I can 100% guarantee you're wrong and chatgpt is now the default tool for the vast majority of people writing these papers. It's not people picking up new words, you have to understand academia is mostly about shitting out as many papers as you can and make them as verbose as possible, it's the perfect use case for LLMs, this field was rotten before, chatgpt just makes it more obvious to the non academia crowd For them not using chatgpt would be like sticking to sailboats while the world moved to steam engines reply ChainOfFools 15 minutes agorootparent> chatgpt is now the default tool for the vast majority of people writing these papers. I'm in a similar sort of circle and I can say that this, though I've not measured rigorously, does strongly square with my own anecdotal experience, and it's especially prevalent with people whose first language is not English but have no choice but to publish (frequently) and apply for grants in English. So many of the writing assistant tools customarily used for first-pass proofreading have gone straight into full LLM integration and no longer simply just check grammar and basic \"elements of style\" issues. Also professional (human) proofreaders are fantastically expensive for the very limited amount of assistance date provide. A couple thousand dollars more (source for this number, a proofreader recommended by Oxford U Pub) for someone to fix some minor semantic redundancies in your 35 page book chapter wording is financially unreasonable for a lot of people in academia. reply luyu_wu 2 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like you have anecdotal evidence from a bad side of academia.

Others have picked up that LLM's like the word \"delves\". LLMs are trained on texts which contain much marketing material. So they tend to use some marketing words when generating pseudo-academic content. No surprise there. I'm surprised it's not worse. What happens if you use a prompt containing \"Write in a style that maximizes marketing impact\"?\" ('You can't always use \"Free\", but you can always use \"New\"' - from a book on copywriting.) reply quartesixte 4 minutes agoparentThe only one here that actually stands out from usage is \"delves\". Every other word on this list is common usage among anyone who has a decent vocabulary and a literary mind. But I guess I'll just get flagged for being a GPT now. reply Hizonner 17 hours agoparentprevI use at least four of those pretty heavily, and I suspect that I'm in the top quartile in terms of using at least three of them.

I am especially very weak at writing a paper, and to be honest, find it taxing. I love research but after having results, turning it into a paper is not fun. I edit almost everything important I write like emails and papers with LLMs because even though the content is nice my writing feels very bland and lacks lots of transition. I believe many people do this and actually, this helps you learn over time. However, what you learn is to write like LLMs since basically we are supervised by the LLM. reply refibrillator 18 hours agoprevOne confounding factor here is the proliferation of autocorrect and grammar “advisors” in popular apps like gmail etc. One algorithm tweak could change a lot of writing at that scale. While the word frequency stats are damning, there doesn’t seem to be any evidence presented that directly ties the changes to LLMs specifically. reply daemonologist 17 hours agoparentI think they address this to some degree by checking different year pairings (end of page 2), where the only excess usage they found was of words related to current events (ebola, coronavirus, etc.) and even then not to the same degree as the 2022-24 pair. It would be interesting to analyze how well a language model is able to predict each abstract. In theory if the text was largely written by a model then a similar model might be able to predict it more accurately than it would a human-written abstract. (Of course the variety of models and frequency at which they're updated makes this more difficult.) reply lioeters 19 hours agoprev> We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. \"Delving\"..

Maybe it was less common in the US than elsewhere? (and do I have to deliberately avoid it now, to avoid sounding like AI?) reply daemonologist 17 hours agorootparentI think it's not an extraordinarily rare word in the US, but it does feel to me more at home in a blog post or business strategy-ish document than a PubMed abstract. People are making a big deal of it just because the signal is so strong (25x more common now than in 2022). reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentYes, it's a bullshit business buzzword. It shows up because the LLMs are trained on a lot of corporate word salad. reply touisteur 14 hours agorootparentIt might rather be because of who is (was) doing the HF of RLFH, or where most big moat builders went https://amp.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/16/techscape... reply dweekly 17 hours agorootparentprevThe spike is global. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=delving&... reply MattGaiser 18 hours agoparentprevThat’s the joke. reply Retr0id 17 hours agoprevIt's also possible that humans are starting to sound more like LLMs too, due to reading (wittingly or otherwise) more LLM output. reply leumassuehtam 14 hours agoparentIt's easy to notice, even on this website, when a comment starts with \"It's worth noting that...\".

Maybe it's just me noticing it more after Chatgpt came to prominence with its subservient ways. reply mcmcmc 17 hours agoprevThis just makes me think how now, more than ever, it really pays to develop your own distinctive writing voice. It’s not just a way to make yourself stand out, but given how much the way you write can influence your thought process, I worry that all the students ChatGPTing their way through language arts classes will be ultimately more susceptible to groupthink and online influence campaigns. reply kccqzy 14 hours agoparentDeveloping such a voice really requires you to read other writing voices minimally lest you be influenced by other voices. I think outside of news, I would be perfectly happy reading only pre-2022 publications. I just don't know how sustainable this is. reply markerz 14 hours agorootparentI disagree, I think a successful writing voice involves reading a lot of different styles and picking the elements that really speak to you. reply kccqzy 4 hours agorootparentI disagree respectfully. Before I write anything substantial, I re-read the few books that I really like to let me subconsciously absorb their elements. If I read modern journalism right before I write, whatever I write will be just like modern journalism: bland and boring. At least for me, there is a very large but temporally proximate influence between what I read and what I write. reply mcmcmc 1 hour agorootparentReading selectively makes sense, but I’d argue there can still be value in critically reading content the style of which you’d rather not emulate directly. For one, you may not always have a choice if you need to research something specific and there’s no high quality source available. You can also learn to pick out distinguishing characteristics of modern writing in order to subvert popular convention or adjust (not abandon) your style to be more accessible for the target audience. reply Loic 8 hours agorootparentprevIt requires writing a lot, more than reading a lot. reply electrodank 16 hours agoparentprevI don’t agree with this. Quick assessment: what makes someone more susceptible to groupthink? To propaganda? Is it the way they write? That doesn’t sound right. It is not an LLM/ChatGPT-borne ailment. So I would not paint these tools as such a boogeyman. reply silver_silver 18 hours agoprevIt’s possible this is caused by the editors rather than the authors. An old partner edited papers for a large publisher - largely written by non-native speakers and already heavily machine translated - and would almost always use ChatGPT for the first pass when extensive changes were needed. She was paid by the word and also had a pretty intense daily minimum quota so it was practically required to get enough done to earn a liveable wage and avoid being replaced by another remote “contractor”. reply userabchn 40 minutes agoparentI am an associate editor of a journal and I have suggested that the journal strongly encourage authors to pass their papers through an LLM before submitting if they think it might need it. A large fraction of the submissions we receive have terrible grammar and unnatural phrasing. The only options for editors are to reject or send out for review. Rejecting because of the grammar seems overly harsh, but I know that it is a lot more laborious to review a paper with bad grammar. The easiest fix seems to be to try to ensure that the grammar is reasonable before papers are submitted. reply progval 12 hours agoparentprevDo editors even change the text in academic publishing? reply Maken 9 hours agorootparentThey do in journals that charge such an exorbitant rate it would look bad if they did not try to justify it. reply silver_silver 8 hours agorootparentprevMost of the papers she worked on were either translations or not written by a native speaker. reply JohnKemeny 9 hours agorootparentprevI have never had an editor change a single word in my papers. reply cortesoft 17 hours agoparentprevThis seems strange… this is an old partner, who had a job long enough to know that the only way to hit a quota to was to use ChatGPT, which came out less than two years ago? It seems strange that something that experimental became essential that quickly. reply silver_silver 8 hours agorootparentThe company is a bit predatory in that they typically employ editors from poorer countries, so her difficulty was more making enough from it than meeting the quota - but the quota was strict enough that you would very quickly lose the position if you kept missing it. I think the situation before ChatGPT was that they employed people who worked very long hours to not earn very much. Apparently turnover was quite high. reply noizejoy 17 hours agorootparentprev> this is an old partner “Old” might be intended to mean “former” or “ex”, which could be as recent as merely weeks ago. (i.e. ESL / lost in translation issue). reply cortesoft 16 hours agorootparentI took it to mean ex, but even if it was only a week ago, for a tool to become essential within a year of existing is pretty crazy. reply knodi123 15 hours agorootparentNo kidding... but it did. I have an aunt who's an editor, and she was basically put out of business by chatgpt. She still gets paid by the same people for the same work, but her rate has been slashed, and since she has no interest in using chatgpt, she'll never make it up in volume. reply sva_ 8 hours agoprevCan even See this in Google trends: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=... reply seydor 15 hours agoprevNothing wrong with it.

Especially after reading many similar works in the field, it is very hard not to be influenced by what you read but you have to make sure not to say the same thing. reply jean- 18 hours agoprevGreat article. One of the papers it cites is https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07183, which is also great and looks at the issue of LLM usage to write peer reviews. It’s an issue I’ve noticed personally, as I’m seeing an increasing number of reviews that lack substance and are almost entirely made of filler content. Here’s an excerpt from a particularly egregious recent example I ran into, which had this to say on the subject of meaningful comparison to recent work: > Additionally, while the bibliography appears to be comprehensive, there could be some minor improvements, such as including more recent or relevant references if applicable. The whole review was written like this, with no specific suggestions for improvement, just vague “if applicable” filler. Infuriating. reply Zancarius 17 hours agoparentFunny. It used to be if you received that sort of response, you might imagine the author being pressed for time and giving a sort of prewritten/canned copy response. I guess LLMs have removed some of the tedium from the process while making it more tedious for the recipient. That's annoying. reply MrSkelter 8 hours agoprevThis apparent language shift is mainly due to Lon’s being trained on all language and not just modern American writing tied to post Hemingway ideals of brevity. Much of the language considered odd is standard British English, like the singular they. Also the use of wider vocabulary isn’t considered bad writing outside the Us where specificity is valued over simplicity. reply aussieguy1234 18 hours agoprevIt won't take long before it's possible to mask LLM use by making the text sound more human like, without the excess vocab. The leap from how the LLMs write now to how a professional sounding scientist might write their paper is probably not that big. Its possible now to train them on your own writing style. reply neilwilson 14 hours agoparentIt's already possible. Upload your text and one you want it to look like, then instruct chatGPT4o to rewrite the first text so it follows the word structure, form and layout of the second one. Then run the whole lot through Grammarly in academic mode to get rid of flowery words and tortuous structures. Too many academic papers try to impress with complex language rather than explaining what needs to be explained in a pithy and succinct manner. reply aussieguy1234 10 hours agorootparentI can confirm this works. reply userbinator 14 hours agoparentprevGiven how many people can't seem to distinguish between LLM output and an actual human, and how many actual humans I've interacted with who I only later realised were actually human, I think it won't be long before humans who can distinguish and write distinctively are a minority. reply rockwotj 16 hours agoparentprevYou can do this with shortwave: https://www.shortwave.com/blog/introducing-ghostwriter-ai-wr...

So yes - AI is seen as useful for people gaming a system for personal advancement at the expense of global scientific progress and the betterment of humanity. reply AlienRobot 18 hours agoprevThis is so disappointing. reply hdhshdhshdjd 17 hours agoparentWhile it would never be published, I imagine if they broke it down by author surname you’d see most of this is non English speakers using a juiced up grammar check. I see no evidence actual findings are changing. Lots of people have good science to contribute and suck at writing English. Making findings easier to digest isn’t bad per se. reply josephg 17 hours agoparentprevEh. Its a tool, just like a calculator, a computer or a drug. Just like everything else that has potency, you can use it well or poorly. I got some help from ChatGPT while writing a recent paper. At one point while writing, I couldn't find a straightforward way to express myself. I was stuck - and then every attempt at writing the same paragraph came out worse than the last. Eventually I gave my draft to chatgpt and asked it to come up with a few suggestions on how to express my ideas more clearly. That really helped. I adapted some of its writing and ended up with a better final result. I'm not sure if anything chatgpt wrote is in the final paper. But I really appreciated the LLM assistance to help me express myself. I'm sure there's a lot of much more egregious examples where chatgpt wholesale wrote large sections of some papers. But its really not the tool that's at fault. Its how the tool is being used. And we simply don't have social norms around that yet, because figuring out norms takes time. The calculator was the same. When is a calculator acceptable in a classroom? In an exam? Our teachers at the time justified \"no calculator\" policies by saying \"You won't have a calculator in your pocket when you're going through life!\". And, well, that turned out to be very wrong. reply viccis 14 hours agorootparentSo you plagiarized for your paper? I mean, people seem to be in agreement that studios using visual AI generated art that draws from existing works is plagiarism, so how did you not commit academic fraud? Did you consider that encountering challenges with expressing yourself and overcoming them is the pedagogical purpose for papers like that? I am assuming your paper was for a class, given your comparison to calculators in a classroom. If not, then my point does not apply. >Our teachers at the time justified \"no calculator\" policies by saying \"You won't have a calculator in your pocket when you're going through life!\". And, well, that turned out to be very wrong. The only time we weren't allowed to use calculators was for things like arithmetic and fraction manipulation. It would indeed be absurd to have to consult a calculator for every numerical step you have to take in math work for subsequent years, so I think your teachers were right. reply josephg 14 hours agorootparent> So you plagiarized for your paper? I don't think I did. And no, it wasn't for a class. Please be more considered before throwing out accusations of academic misconduct. That is a very heavy term. Anyway, I don't think what I did is any more \"academic misconduct\" than using Grammerly is academic misconduct. They're both uses of LLMs, sure. But the uses are different and we need to start differentiating them. If you think AI generated art is plagerism, would you therefore conclude that photoshop's content aware fill is plagerism, since it uses the same AI models? Or Apple's smart selection tool? > The only time we weren't allowed to use calculators was for things like arithmetic and fraction manipulation. [...] so I think your teachers were right. (Emphasis mine) Seems pretty strange to assume my teachers were right given you have no idea what country I went to school in or what their policy was on calculators. reply firesteelrain 11 hours agorootparentWhat else is the reason to write a “paper” if not for a class or journal or conference? Do you write papers just because? I don’t care if anyone uses LLMs to help write papers as long as it doesn’t falsify findings. reply josephg 6 hours agorootparentI’m certainly not falsifying any findings. I just needed some help finding English words to help make the math easier to understand. I’m sorry for this, but if some members of this community are ready and willing to make claims of academic misconduct over the idea of using an llm as a writing assistant, I don’t think I trust this community enough to go into more details in this thread. reply firesteelrain 4 hours agorootparentYou are overreacting. No one is getting what you are talking about. reply jdoe2020 14 hours agorootparentprevWell for the studios the art is the product. For researchers the ideas and data are the product and the writing is packaging. It's not a perfect analogy but it gets across why I personally don't get up in arms about this. Provided the findings aren't being changed does it really matter? Sometimes chatgpt is a useful editor for flow in the same way you'd ask a colleague or spouse. And If it levels the playing field between native English speakers and foreigners that is good in my book. reply dkga 18 hours agoprev [–] \"delving\" reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "2023-07-22 Why your brain is 3 milion more times efficient than GPT-4 - dead simple introduction to Embeddings, HNSW, ANNS, Vector Databases and their comparison based on experience from production project Recently I had to go on journey into the Vector Database world and pick one for a particular project. And oh boy, was it a ride. Recently Vector Databases have gained a newfound attraction and spotlight thanks to the rise of LLMs. Such situation is both a blessing and a little bit of a curse, bringing some of the things attributed to LLMs to Vector Databases too - the perception they are 'a new thing', untested technology or some shiny crap good only for LLM-based stuff. All of which is wrong. Vector Databases have been with us for waaay longer than most know. There's legit engineering, science and rigorous testing behind most of them over the span of multiple years. And there's a lot of them, they all have their own quirks, just a little bit like RDBMSes do, except the situation there is quite clear, at least for me, in most cases postgres FTW, I mean it's not 2005 anymore, we won't go with mysql or LAMP stack, right? Do most of you even remember what it is or am I exaggerating things? In case of Vector Databases I was, and still am, actually, completely green. So I had to go around, gather facts, check stuff out and form my opinion regarding each particular database, as to select one for my particular use case. Before we begin, let me put a disclaimer here. I do not title myself as an expert in AI. There are all my just personal ramblings, opinions, certainly biased. Take everything you read with a grain of salt and do your own due dilligence. Introduction to Vectors, Similarity and our amazing brains Before we actually begin I think we should dig a bit deeper into what exactly we are playing around. If you are not interested in understanding how this all works in detail and how it relates to generative AI, feel free to skip this part and go over to the next section. First we must lay down certain axioms (smart word for the common sense/ground rules we all agree upon and accept as true). One of such would be the fact that currently computers do not really understand words. They operate in what is called binary language, so a string of 0s and 1s. It's related to how electric charge, electrons and atoms work. Physics stuff. Very basics of CS and electronics. So: Computers do not understand words, they operate on binary language, which is just 1s and 0s, so numbers. Computers only understand numbers. Knowing that, it becomes obvious, that we may face some problems. First of all if it's all just 1 or 0, how do we express different numbers? Well, that part is easy, because thanks to the decimal counting system. Long story short, we have 10 digits to express stuff, in binary you have 2. That means that you still can represent other numbers with base 2, the resulting number will be just a bit longer and calculated differently. I won't to into too much of a detail here, you can look it up yourself -> binary system, decimal system and how to convert from one to another. Or ask chatgpt for an explanation. It does a fine job. Just know that any natural number can be easily converted from base ten to binary e.g. \"4\" in decimal i s \"100\" in binary. They hold equivalent value, but are expressed differently. The case is a bit more complicated for floating point numbers, but let's not get into that now. So first layer of abstraction is down. We have computers. Electric. Electrons. High current/low current, current/no current. 1s and 0s. These 1s and 0s of ours now can magically become numbers. This is what our computers operate on - in every case. When you dig deep enough, everything you interact with in the virtual world is in fact a number, so a particular configuration of these tiny little something's in the computer that either have electricity running through them, or they don't and that is interpreted as a number. Imagine 3 light bulbs. 1st is on, 2nd and 3rd are off. 1-0-0. We magically agreed that this means 4. Now make the size smaller probably by a thousand, a milion times or something, and you get an idea what's going on in that shiny macbook of yours. Back to the topic. Numbers. Yes, we have then and are able to somehow interpret the current state of your computer, or it's part as it being a particular number. Now that's not very useful, right? We, humans, mostly operate on text and language, right? Yup. Imagine a world where you have to decode numbers. in some magic dictionary to a word. The computers wouldn't be so useful now, would they? But that's how it looks in the background. Long time ago some smart dudes have gathered around that agreed that from now on, if we know we are dealing with text, we should interpret the number 65 as \"A\", \"B\" as 66 and so on. Of course, it changed, different people had different standards and agreements but who cares, let's simplify. We come to understand the second axiom: We, as socity, have assigned certain roles/meaning to particular numbers, in this case it's letters. Now that we have our computer, that understands numbers, and we know which numbers in which case are which letters, we kinda can start forming words for example. And if you have words you can have sentences, code, whatnot. That's more useful. All of your software builds on top of this base truth. Now that we know that all words in fact, are nothing but numbers for your computer, we can go further than that. For the computer, a given word, regardless of the context, based on the above, holds the same 'meaning' or 'value'. So even though you can say 'dust the furniture' as in clean or 'dust on the furniture' as in there's a mess, the representation (and the meaning) for the computer would stay the same, even though there's a mess and clean are two totally different things. So, even though we can convert a word for a distinctive number for the computer so it 'knows' kind of, what's up, there's missing 'context' to judge the meaning. Words simply represented as binary numbers lack context. Well, humans can be ingenious in the ways they do wicked things, but also in the ways the do great things. One such example here would be Contextualized word embeddings. What does that stand for? Well, let me tell you. So we have this now simple case of turning a series of 1s and 0s into numbers, numbers into letters and then words. That you already understood, right? We kinda explained the problem with that - lack of context. Well. We have developed methods that allow us to generate different and unique numbers for words, depending on their context or semantic meaning. So if we used Contextualized Word Embeddings in our example above, the 'dust' from 'dust the furniture' would get totally different number than the word dust in 'dust on the floor'. Now the computer knows that these two have different meaning! How does that exactly work? It's a piece of work, let me tell you, but we won't cover that in this text. First of all I'd have to understand that myself haha. Long story short, we have a magic function that does this: number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning(\"dust\", context=\"dust on the floor\") == 42 number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning(\"dust\", context=\"dust the floor\") == 24 The values are not random - words that within certain context have different meaning probably will have very different number assigned to them. A number that is far apart from the other one. If the meanings were similar, but just slightly different depending on the context, we'd have numbers that are closer to each other. number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning(\"bark\", context=\"bark is a noun\") == 12 number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning(\"bark\", context=\"bark is a verb\") == 19 Why is that? \"Bark\" and \"bark\" both relate to something that is assosciated with outer protection or covering. If a dog barks usually it is a sign of danger, something related to safety, protection. The tree has a bark in order to protect itself from the environment. It's different, still, but this time we share a certain common theme at least in some sense, hence the numbers we got are closer together than in the previous case, because they are more similar. Also Similar meaning of words, in a particular context, converted to numbers, are closer to each other than radically different meanings. By the way, what are embeddings you might wonder? Why did I not describe it earlier? Because we need to understand the above to understand embeddings. More or less it's what we described, so the way of representing a number based on particular set of criteria (in our case the semantic meaning) as similar numbers, even if they are not similar raw value wise. So in the embeddings world, 'dust' would be, as a number, closer to 'clean' than 'dust' would be to 'dirt'. At least that's how I understand it. And 'dust' as in 'dust the floor' would be far away from both 'dust on the floor' or 'dirt'. Alright, this one was a bit trickier, but we got there eventually. Again, let me reiterate. We have electrons and then electricity. Because of electricity (or to be more exact high/low current) we have 1s and 0s, so binary language. Next are numbers, binary numbers, so just numbers but expressed only with 1s and 0s, base 2. That gets converted to base 10, so the decimal system that we humans mostly use (not everywhere and not always lol). These numbers then get simply mapped to words with the same values regardless of the context, of the meaning, in the base case. But nowadays, we iterated over that and can assosciate words with their meaning and assign different numbers, based on the context of the text or a sentence (sentence transformers sounds familiar?) and their semantic meaning. The groundbreaking publication about Transformer model. Go look it up. By the way look at the year it was published and how quickly we went from theoreticall stuff to something as amazing as GPT-4. INSANE. Either way. Semantic meaning, embeddings and transformer model. This is the reason that the LLMs or generative AI can sound so convincing, as if it really knew the stuff it generated. Nope, it doesn't. It just processes numbers, they do not intrinsically understand the meaning, they understand that 1 is closer to 2 than 24 is to 42, which is the answer to everything. See what I did there? This does not imply it 'understands' the meaning in the human sense and why I'm quite sure that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), so something that 'really' thinks in the most human way, is so far away. The current technology and models, simply do not work like we assume them to. Okay champ. We have these words mapped to different numbers, which are either closer or further away, depending on the semantic meaning in a particular context. What now? Well, math magic comes in. I ain't no maths guy, I do enjoy the thought exercises or elementary and truthfully representation of stuff it can provide, nowadays I'd struggle to solve quadratic equation probably, being just a simple highschool dropout, but let me share with you my understanding of this absolutely marevelous phenomenon that happens. So, numbers. In maths we have this thing called Algebra. It's a study of relationships between things that vary over time, which are represented by symbols, usually letters, which also can represent things, usually numbers. What? ... Yeah. That would be my reaction to this statement too, at least was in the past. Let's make it a bit more digestible. To put it in simple terms, for us numbers are things that allow us to measure reality, count things, they are building blocks of reality you could say. Almost everything (or as some would argue - everything), given a proper formula, could be represented as a number. Be it something so physical as the length of your arm, number of apples in your kitchen or something as abstract as human language or even the meaning of a word, which we have demonstrated above. That however relates to this particular branch of mathemathics and 'real' stuff. In here numbers are immanent, simple, natural, the best. What about branches of maths that operate on a bit different set of rules and so on? Different universes of sorts? Well, in there numbers might not be the best base unit of operation, in different universes we might need either different base building blocks or we might want to take numbers and extend them a bit, if you will, to make life easier. One such example is the study of Linear Algebra. Linear Algebra has 'vectors' (which in fact are numbers with certain additional stuff to abstract ideas and make life easier) the same way basic Algebra has numbers/symbols/variables. I won't go into the details here too much as my understanding is also not so perfect, and probably I'd spout some gibberish, but I hope you get the analogy. So in Linear Algebra we have vector spaces, which deal with vectors, that have something to do with 'space' in general. Space might sound familiar because we talked about it. Remember the 'distance' between the numbers which were representations of meaning of a given word in a particular context? Yep, the same stuff let's say. Space can have many 'dimensions', similarly with vectors. If you have one dimension, it's just [1]. If we have two, e.g. X & Y axis, we can position a point in place by having, well, two numbers for each dimension, eg [1,1], this should ring a bell if you remember anything from your middleschool math class. What if we have 3D space? Well, similar stuff. Notice how each additional dimension multiplies the number of all the possible vectors. So let's assume we are working on a limited range of natural numbers, 10. In 1D case, we have 10 options. In 2D space we have 10 possibilities for first one, 10 for the second one, which totals to 10 * 10 = 100 possible different combinations. In case of 3d? You get the idea. So now imagine how insanely big the possibilities are, if we are working with a bit of a broader range (e.g. 65536 or 256) and not with 3 dimensions, but with 1536! That's INSANE. Absolutely insane, but also what allows our LLMs to seemingly perceive so many nuances in the meanings of the words and what nots. I know it was a long digression, but bear with me. Again. We have electrons and then electricity. Yeah, I'll spare you that repetition again. Number representation of a word based on semantic meaning. So we have a number per meaning in a given context let's say. This number gets then turned into a vector which lives inside vector space. To accomodate for the many meanings and contexts and how contextual our actions, words and speech are, this vector space should have appropriate number of dimensions. It can't have too much as it'd get too huge to process. OpenAI settled for 1536 dimensions. Remember each 'dimension' can be assigned a different 'value', so the total number of possible meanings is THE_MAX_NUMBER_WE_OPERATE_ON to the power of 1536. THAT\"S A LOT. Anyhow. We went from having 1s and 0s, to our words being evaluated in 1536 dimensions or 'meanings'. The more true to a particular meaning is that word, the higher the value it'll get in that dimension. As you can see we have a problem now. How do we actually process such a humongous amount of data? Traditional methods don't really work well or would be too expensive computationally or economically. This is what we call \"curse of dimensionality\". To deal with this stuff like Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search problem show up. Meaning: how do we find similar vectors (numbers) in very high dimensional spaces? To resolve that puzzle we came up with Hierarchical Navigable Small World or HNSW. What is that? Long story short, even though the space is so HUGE, usually, in large networks, eg. human ones or social ones, despite the size, most nodes can be reached from any place in the network with surprisingly few steps. It's often reffered to as \"six phones rule\", that states that you are at maximum six phone call aways from anyone in the world. You know someone who knows someone and so on, then boom. Your message gets delivered to Obama. It's quite interesting actually. Important to note is that not all nodes in the network are connected equally. There are these things called as hyperconnectors, which connect to A LOT of nodes, and the contrary so, the nodes that are a bit lonely. I think you get the idea and seen an example in your life - almost everybody knows that someone who seems to know everybody everywhere. Either way, as I digress. If we take this Small World thing and add one more thing on top of it - hierarchy, managing even such a huge amount of data becomes doable. What does it look like? Simple. Think in terms of enterprise org chart. It's as if, let's say, you were a CEO and wanted to know something about if your company does use type hinting in python like human beings do. In HNSW the approach would be to first select a candidate, who might know something (be similar to the topic/value you search for) from a very few selected people in the company (mby the hyperconnectors should be at the top? ;)). Let's say the are Lead/Director level people. So you e.g. have Director of PeopleOPs, Director of Product, Director of Engineering and so on. Out of these, the semantic value of Director of Engineering will be most similar to \"do we use type hinting in python\". So we go to him and there we repeat the process. However our guys here are lazy for whatever reason. he doesn't want to check or write the answer, so he delegates. -> who does the director know, who in the hierarchy is the level below him (these are the guys he knows best, he doesn't know the ones lower too well as he doesn't interact with them often) that should know the answer? So he repeats the process: Engineering Manager in Frontend team, EM in DevOps, EM in Backend team. Backend Team it is. Now this process gets repeted till we hit the bottom most layer of hierarchy, how many there are is up to the organisation to decide. This way instead of the CEO asking maximum number of N people in the worst case, assuming that only the last person knew, the question gets asked only N maximum number of times, where N is the number of layers in the hierarchy we have. Or something like that. Of course if he asked the question to everyone he would have better data and could select the best answer. The one he will get in the case of using HNSW will be good enough (how good we want will require us to define a certain metric, but the more accurate the answer needs to be, the tricker it is computationally) but will cost SIGNIFICANTLY less to get. Think sth like rolling out a feature that covers 80% of the needs in 2 weeks vs perfecting it to 99.99% in 2 years. 80% (or 50 or 95) is usually good enough when you weight the pros and cons, cost/benefit. WOAH. Long story long, this is what enables us to process such huge amounts of data taht is so high in dimensionality, that can accomodate the various context, nuances and meanings that is assosciated with for example human speech or thinking process. Now imagine our brains do this at a higher and more profund level than this, they do it constantly, all the time, they fit into something small like our skull and run on the equivalent of 24 Watts of power per hour. In comparison GPT-4 hardware requires SWATHES of data-centre space and an estimated 7.5 MW per hour. So around 312 500x less while doing stuff that is thousand times more sophisticated. WHAT THE FLYING FK. We are a wonder of Nature. An amazing, fu**ing mess of a wonder but a wonder nonetheless. Also, keep in mind that our brains don't dedicate 100% of the horsepower to conscious thinking processes. According to Auburn Unviersity paper I found, cognitive neuroscientists believe that only 5% of our cognitive activity is conscious. So multiply this number by anything from 20 to a 100. Let's be conservative and say 10 for some reason. That's still over 3 million times the efficiency than GPT-4, while also having at least a magnitude (or at least N) greater complexity. I got carried away in the amazement. TLDR: Electrons -> Electricity -> Binary -> Binary Numbers -> \"Human\" or base 10 numbers -> Letters -> Words -> Embeddings -> (Semantically) Contextual Word Embeddings -> Vectors -> Vector Spaces -> High Dimension Vector Spaces -> Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search or just Nearest Neighbour Search (ANNS/NNS) -> Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) Soak up all these terms and write them down. From here we are almost done. If you've been following closely you might start to piece the puzzles together. LLMs are in fact just algorithms, very complex ones, that have indexed or ingested A LOT of data/words, vectorized and embedded them and their meanings in particular context. Then, based on that data, they just 'guess', based on context, that if we have this particular thing or meaning in a semantic context, so embeddings, so nubmers or vectors in high dimensional space, just right here, we probably have in mind this particular response which is nothing but a set of other embeddings. Also usually when we speak about embeddings, we deal with tokens, which usually are not whole words but like ~4 characters in English. So if based on the context and approximation, we know that this particular query seems like something that will be assosciated with this particular token, we will use it. Then if we have one token ahead, we can repeat the process till we start hitting lower levels of assosciation, which in turn means that we can probably stop generating as the answer is complete. So... Yup. There's no thinking happening. Just assosciating numbers and guessing. You read that right. GPT-4 does not 'think' at all. It's as far away from human consciousness as we are from Putin being a good guy. This simply does not come even close. So it's the reason I do not worry at night (at least yet) AGI will come and replace me or go on a consciouss crusade against humanity. Bear in mind, my understanding of the stuff is VERY limited, I'm all new to this. I've simplified A LOT not only for the reader, but also for myself. If any of this is unjustly inaccurate, let me know. I've googled most of the stuff along the way. WHOAH. DAMN THAT WAS LONG. Let's answer the initial question then. How do vector databases work then? Well, they take the text. Vectorize it. Embedd in high-dimension space, then if you query it, they search for approximate similar tokens/pieces/texts. Simple, right? Now with that over, let's get to the stuff I had in mind when starting the article, so comparison of vector databases and a raport from using some of the more popular ones. Starting point - chromaDB My starting point was chromaDB. It allowed me get up & running quickly and seamlessly. It was dead simple and it got the job done. However it wasn't the best approach TBH. For a PoC? Yup, it did get the job done. But for more serious, potentially production-grade stuff? Not given how I implemented it. Long story short, for a PoC, I created this Q&A over a scraped knowledge centre app let's say. I needed a VectorDB deseprately. Pinecone was off-record for obious reasons that I'll list later on in the article, even though it was the easiest to implement I'd say. There was stuff like FAISS and what not, but the choice, over initial exploration, fell on chromaDB. I used a very dirty approach, where I packaged it together in one container with the API backend part of the application. ChromaDB persisted the vectors in their internal format in a certain directory in my project's repo. I simply commited it to the repo. Not the best, I know. Now, the whole VDB (Vector Database) was a part of our repo. I locally ingested the data that I needed in the VDB, then commited the state of the VDB to the repo. chromadb got added as a project dependency (installing it is quite trivial - it's just a python package) to pyproject.toml and boom. Initialise it somewhere in the code during application startup and boom, you done. Again, this is very dirty approach. API is packaged in the same container as the DB. In this setup changes in the VDB are not really persisted unless you commit them to the repo - only the commited state matters (so read-only apps or go home champ). They share resources. If one fails, the other does too. It was somehow scalable given that we had read-only app, so it was self-contained but... The git repo got big, fast. The docker image build time got very long for my standards. I mean imagine 25-30m build time for a simple fastAPI app. Not exactly desirable. This came from the fact that the chromadb was inside the container and had to be rebuilt each time the code changed, and as you can imagine, rebuilding db package can be quite time consuming (looking at you, psycopg). We couldn't go on for long with this approach. Ofc you can run chromadb as a separate container, self-hosted, but that added overhead I didn't need at that time for a PoC. At that time, from what I remember, there was also no option to do proper clustering that'd allow you to get prod-level scalability, survavibality and so on. TLDR: you could run with a single instance and that's it. I also didn't see helm/k8s OOB support that'd make it easy to deploy in a cluster somewhere. On top of that other projects were in the pipeline, then what? Each of them should have their own instance? How would we share data? All of this meant, it had to go away. But it allowed me to get off the ground, integrate fast, LEARN a lot and so on. For this purpose it did an AMAZING job. Also, what needs to be said is that some of the features mentioned weren't supported at the time I was creating the project, which was couple of months ago. Since then Chroma has closed $18M seed round, developed a solid roadmap and started addressing some of what was mentioned here. We had a nice talk with Jeff Huber, chromadb's Founder, about all of this. I really loved a lot how he was humble and helpful enough to admit, that given the preconditions for the project & productionisation, chroma at that time wasn't exactly the best choice, and choosing something else for our needs was a smart move! He is a very intelligent, passionate and brilliant guy, so I'm more than eager to see how they develop, however till we see the features shipped, in the use cases we had in mind, it was a no-go. However to get started, have one-self-contained app with db inside and be done in 4h instead of 4 days (I know i exaggurate)? Sure, why not. If I was to make a comparison to something people are more familiar with,RDMBSes, I'd say the current chroma is like sqlite. Easier to comprehend now where it can shine and where it won't? Great. Also remember, my approach was simple. If you do it properly, set up all the proper stuff, configure it nicely, adhere to best practices, you probably won't run into any problems. I did not do that, lack of time & expertise. A short edit here needed to happen. I've reviewed this together with Jeff (THANKS) and he shed light on how most of these issues got addresed in v0.4. They made an architectural shift in their design, changed the storage engine, the build is now at least 20x faster (which now makes my point invalid), requires way less memory (that was not an issue though, but is good to see) and is far more performand and durable (even in April I did not run into any issues with durability). Overall, as I've predicted before actually getting the message from Jeff, it's been a short time, yet they've made amazing progress. This made me reshuffle the recomendations part a bit and this + the coming changes, make chroma a strong candidate to evaluate. I still need to play around with it more to see the exact progress but seems promising. So now, most of the stuff that I mentioned in this section, that were relevant at the time of making the choice - April, are not a concern now. Keep this in mind. Next steps So if chromaDB was out of the picture. What next? Let's see what's out there. Let's start with stuff that failed fairly quickly. Pinecone Long story short. It's a black box hosted somewhere, VDB as a Service. Proprietary. No-go. I want control over my data, where my db is deployed, where it lives and so on. Sorry. Privacy & Compliance would not be happy, same with myself. Faiss It's just a library. not a full fledged VDB. It'd be a step back compared to chroma, so no. But for tiny PoCs? Possible. Evalute it. I didn't do that in detail. Milvus This one seemed promising. Initially I thought we'd roll with them. Promised all the new shiny nice stuff, but then I actually started using it. Had troubles to even index the data. Started running into bugs (or documentation not explaining stuff dumb enough for me to get it or not explaining at all), weird edge cases and complications that I was not in for. In case of chroma I just plugged it in, ran my Langchain-based data-ingestion service and I was done. Here? Forget it. However it was farily decent and pleasant to run locally in docker, a bit less so in k8s, but still passable. Bonus points for OS, self-hosted version and on-prem + cloud possibilty. If I was to make a similar comaprison as I did in case of chromadb, I'd say Milvus is the old Oracle DB of Vector Database world. Plus I've heard some similar opinions and unconfirmed rumours regarding ceratin dubious possible origins/practices and policies. It did seem promising but ended up as a failure last minute. Eventually I did succeed in ingesting the data and so on, but the results were not satisfactory. Performance was okay, but I was done with frustration. pgvector This one disappointed me greatly. Bad performance. Unusual selection of the underlying algorithm. Some problems with accuracy, especially when concurrency comes into play. Think carefully if the ease of integration is worth it. In my opinion this + the performance weren't. Take a look at the benchmarks. It's not satisfactory to say the least. It also turned out that it's not supported everywhere as it's relatively new extension, for postgres standards. And it's me who says this, guy who is team postgres. But postgres is a great RDBMS. Again, it does not specialise in vectors. The benefit here is it being a standard piece of infrastructure, having your data in one place, all the other benefits postgres brings. It's still useful piece of software. Bear in mind though, that in AWS world, aurora does not support it yet. Meaning if you are in aurora world, you'll need to deploy a separate base postgres instance with pgvector enabled. This eliminates the main benefit. However if you do not care about that, you are running your own pgvector instance, and just want to get started? Hm, maybe. So there might be some relevant and valid use cases, but not in my case. The performance was not there, accuracy also, especially when concurrency is considered and throughput. We couldn't deploy it in our Aurora cluster, we'd need to go for separate RDS. I think I'll pass, however it was indeed tempting because of the postgres brand, it being so reliable and common, but let's consider the borader picture - this was 2nd iteration where I expected things to be done in a proper, future-proof manner. For RDBMS just go postgres. For VDB? Think twice about using pgvector. Redis Redis was a strong possible candidate. Good performance. Standard piece of infrastructure. Everyone knows redis, right? Features on the thin side though. I wasn't sure if, given some time, it'd be enough. But I kept it in place. It more or less worked. However It lingered in my mind that Redis is not specialised in Vectors. It's key value store. This is not the core of their business. Sure it'd be nice to be able to just deploy redis and have it done with. Everyone knows redis. However doubts sprouted in my mind, rightfully so eg. given their recent sunsetting of Redis Graph. However if you already have a Redis cluster running somewhere, for starting it might be enough. There is the question of perfromance, sure, but it's acceptable. So, yeah, viable choice, but make a conscious decision. Qdrant Open source? Check. Self-hosted option? Check. Cloud if you are lazy? Check. K8s? Check. Clustering? Check. Survavibality? Check. Performance? Off the charts. Community? Great. Integration with langchain and other libs? Yup. One-line docker and you good to go locally? You bet. I was sold. But then it got better. Within hours of signing up for their cloud offering to test things out I was approached by the founders to check in. Big shotout to @Andre Zayarni, @Fabrizio Schmidt and @Andrey Vasnetsov. Keep doing what you doing. We had a meeting set up right after. Tremendous knowledge. I really like the spirit they operate in or the values they highlight in some of their blog articles, especially the one related to closing the seed round. Andre's writing is sharp AF. Snarky remarks about the article not being written by chatGPT get bonus points (btw gonna steal that one). They offered help (despite me not earning them a dime at that moment and stating that it'd be the case for the coming future or it'll be dime a dollar) with everything. Accommodated to our needs. Shared slack channel if problems arise? There you go. You wanna learn more? Sure, here are the resources. Workshops? Possible. Also, big shotout to @Kacper Łukawski, which is just in love with spreading knowledge and helping out people. He provided lots of insights and offered help to get started out. Real beneficial stuff. Tutorials, blog posts, integrations with most popular libraries. Free tier in the cloud offering to test stuff out (that actually can take you far along?) provided to anyone. Qdrant wins by far, in my experience, when it comes to performance, scalability, durability, ease of use, feature set, flexibility and most importantly community plus the company values. On top of that you can get started in minutes. It was best performance, easiest to use & set up, well documented, nice community. Clear win. As you can see I'm totally biased and sold, so take what I wrote with a grain of salt and verify yourself all of the above. I'll however remain quite bullish Weaviate Heard some good stuff here, especially regarding the feature set. However did not try it out personally. Compared to qdrant tho, they do have to improve on performance probably, but it might be a valid potential choice. Plus their community seems nice. Or I'm being biased only because @Philip Vollet, so their head of Dev Growth laughed at my joke about pgvector, so he seems salty in similar way to myself, which implicates good stuff. Eh, Olaf and his shenanigans again. Either way. Check it out, should be ok. Tie it all together So now, we understand some basic concepts regarding the vectors, embeddings, fundaments of CS, HNSW, ANNS. What Vector Databases do, is to tie this all together, provide more functionalities on top of that and some abstraction layer, so you don't have to reinvent the while, and on top of that, they also take care about the regular stuff that databases do. What are they? Well, it's mostly stuff related to scalability (so you can easily handle millions of users), persistence (so stuff doesn't get lost), survivability (so it doesn't randomly die easily), data consistency and so on. It's A LOT of work to do. We don't want to take care about all of these ourselves, do we? So that's why we let Vector Databases take care of that. It's something they should excell at, other than performance and accuracy, obviously. It's not easy at all. Also, I think that before you call your product a Database, it's required it meets at least some of these conditions as lately, in the hype driven world, it's not always the case. Given that, all of the above and certain set of requirements I had for the project, I did the evaluation and research as to which product to actually choose. Below you'll find a very brief and to the point summary of it. I didn't want to dig deep into the tech details to keep this article digestible, so these will come eventually in another article. Summary Qdrant rocks and wins. In all categories. It's postgres of the VDB world. Weaviate seems to be nice too, but don't quote me on that. Features seem nice and rich for LLMs. Pinecone gets you started in minutes, but so does qdrant and why would you lock yourself in their ecosystem? Plus the performance and price, but might be valid choice for some folks just coz of the Managed mindset and convenience. Chromadb lacks certain features, but develops quickly, however it needs evaluation and observation for bigger projects or situations where we need real clusters. For smaller ones with proper setup I'd say it's a valid choice + look out for their development and upcoming features. A bit like sqlite of the VDB world, but on steroids currently. Redis is acceptable, but doesn't shine IMO. Positive surprise performance wise. It's not core of their business tho, plus they seem to be sunsetting certain parts that do not belong to the core like RedisGraph. pgvector is disappointing, but still can be valid in some use cases and scenarios, it levarage the postgres brand and benefits which also enforce certain limitations on it. Do not count on great performance though or accuracy with concurrency. Milvus is what I'd stay away from. Old Oracle of VDB world. For anything that can hit production, FAISS is a no-go, it's just a lib. For simple play-around hobby projects? Why not. Yes, this was written by a human in a 4h long flow state powered act of uninterrupted creativity. It was fun, I've actually learned a lot. I've written this in one go almost, except minor stuff or including the feedback from Jeff. I'll leave it mostly unedited, with original wording and typos.",

    "commentBody": "Why your brain is 3 milion more times efficient than GPT-4 (grski.pl)148 points by sebastianvoelkl 10 hours agohidepastfavorite187 comments cynusx 9 hours agoThe comparison doesn't really hold. He is comparing energy spend during inference in humans with energy spend during training in LLM's. Humans spend their lifetimes training their brain so one would have to sum up the total training time if you are going to compare it to the training time of LLM's. At age 30 the total energy use of the brain sums up to about 5000 Wh, which is 1440 times more efficient. But at age 30 we didn't learn good representations for most of the stuff on the internet so one could argue that given the knowledge learned, LLMs outperform the brain on energy consumption. That said, LLM's have it easier as they are already learning from an abstract layer (language) that already has a lot of good representations while humans have to first learn to parse this through imagery. Half the human brain is dedicated to processing imagery, so one could argue the human brain only spend 2500 Wh on equivalent tasks which makes it 3000x more efficient. Liked the article though, didn't know about HNSW's. Edit: made some quick comparisons for inference Assuming a human spends 20 minutes answering in a well-thought out fashion. Human watt-hours: 0.00646 GPT-4 watt-hours (openAI data): 0.833 That makes our brains still 128x more energy efficient but people spend a lot more time to generate the answer. Edit: numbers are off by 1000 as I used calories instead of kilocalories to calculate brain energy expense. Corrected: human brains are 1.44x more efficient during training and 0.128x (or 8x less efficient) during inference. reply CuriouslyC 7 hours agoparentYou're doing apples and oranges. Humans who spend a long time doing inference have not fully learned the thing being inferred - unlike LLMs, when we are undertrained, rather than a huge spike in error rate, we go slower. When humans are well trained, human inference absolutely destroys LLMs. reply cheema33 4 hours agorootparent> When humans are well trained, human inference absolutely destroys LLMs. This isn't an apt comparison. You are comparing a human trained in a specific field to an LLM trained on everything. When an LLM is trained with a narrow focus as well, human brain cannot compete. See Garry Kasparov vs Deep Blue. And Deep Blue is very old tech. reply karmakaze 3 hours agorootparentAlso DeepBlue isn't an ML it's an \"expert system, relying upon rules and variables defined and fine-tuned by chess masters and computer scientists\" from Wikipedia. AlphaGo (or AlphaGo Zero) would be a better example. reply CuriouslyC 3 hours agorootparentprev1. Deep blue isn't a LLM. I don't care how well you train a LLM, it's not going to be more efficient than an optimally trained human, not even close. It's actually arrogant as hell to assume that we can achieve a higher level of energy efficiency than billions of years of evolution, particularly so early in the game. 2. Chess is a closed form system with a finite and relatively small number of position compared with the real world. reply bufferoverflow 2 hours agoparentprevAlso, human brains come pre-trained by billions of years of evolution. It doesn't start as a randomly-connected structure. It already knows how to breathe, how to swallow, how to lean new things. reply bamboozled 7 hours agoparentprevHumans spend their lifetimes training their brain I don't think this is true personally, ideally as children, we spend out time having fun and learning about the world is a side effect. This borg like thinking applied to intelligence because we have LLMs is unusual to me. I learned surfing through play and enjoyment, not through training like a robot. We can train for something with intention, but I think that is mostly a waste of energy, albeit necessary on occasion. reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparent> we spend out time having fun and learning about the world is a side effect What do you think \"play\" is? Animals play to learn about themselves and the world, you see most intelligent animals play as kids with the play being a simplification of what they do as adults. Human kids similarly play fight, play build things, play cook food, play take care of babies etc, it is all to make you ready for an adult life. Playing is fun since playing helps us learn, otherwise we wouldn't evolve to play, we would evolve to be like ants that just work all day long if that was more efficient. So the humans who played around beat those who worked their ass off, otherwise we would all be hard workers. reply bamboozled 6 hours agorootparentBut I just play because it's fun, I roll dice for fun, are you trying to tell me all this is a secret front for \"training\" ? reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparentFun is your brain rewarding you for something it thinks is practice on a useful skill. You get bored once you mastered it enough. Some people continue playing a game even when it stops being fun, they are addicted to the reward mechanism in the game, and now the brain thinks that playing the game is a good way to work and provide for itself. I don't call that \"play\", its work, just not productive work. Why is dice fun? Because your brain wants to map the pattern of the dice, trying to figure out how to get good rolls. You see that in most dice players, they develop a lot of superstition about what is good and bad dice, or how they always roll bad in critical moments etc. I'd assume that is from nature where you try to figure out what is a good nut to crack or where to find prey etc, basically a way to figure out useful patterns from random events. reply bamboozled 6 hours agorootparentSo when I look at a sunset and enjoy that, I think it's fun to chase sunsets, my \"brain\" is telling me it's fun because I'm learning a new skill and receiving a dopamine reward for looking at the sunset and feeling good about it? reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparentLooking at a sunset isn't a game you play, kids don't go and play \"look at the sunset\", I feel like you are grasping at straws. Why would you feel calm and comfortable from a sunset? Probably to get you sleepy so you go find a place to sleep since there isn't much useful to do at night. That would be unrelated to play. Anyway, most of our feelings comes from nature, we didn't evolve to be faulty, we evolved to do things efficiently, play is a part of efficiency. If it isn't for learning you would have to explain what it is more likely to be for. When kittens play and chase things or play fight with each other, do you think they are just wasting energy for no reason? No, they sharpen their senses and learn to hunt and fight. reply bamboozled 6 hours agorootparentI never said kids play like that. I do. As an adult, I find it fun and enjoyable to seek out sunsets I find the colors beautiful. I readily hike mountains just to enjoy a sunset. I watch a sunset and then go party till 3 am, so maybe it's got to do with finding a nice place to sleep, or maybe it's just nice that we have the ability to appreciate phenomenon without having to apply some rigorous concept to it. I'd fly 2/3 of the way around the world to watch a total eclipse. Personally I think you might be clasping at straws trying to equate every pleasant experience to some type of reward function. I'd go as far as saying if we worked this simply and predictably, then our lives would be much easier. We'd all be exercising for that dopamine hit, we'd all be going to bed early after a nice sunset, but we dont. reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparentDoing enjoyable things isn't \"play\", it isn't work and you relax but it isn't the same thing as playing. > Personally I think you might be clasping at straws trying to equate every pleasant experience to some type of reward function. No, here I just focus on why play is fun, you tried to pivot to other pleasurable experiences. Unlike watching sunsets basically every animal plays around as kids, that play is therefore something that is directly related to survival of the fittest or we wouldn't see that everywhere. You need a really strong argument why for humans play doesn't fill that role when it fills that role for basically every other intelligent animal. > I'd go as far as saying if we worked this simply and predictably, then our lives would be much easier So you think humanity would be better off if nobody played around and discovered new things? We would be stuck as monkeys in trees then. Play is pivotal to humanity. reply bamboozled 5 hours agorootparentHow can you argue I’m smuggling ”enjoyable” experiences into the argument when you yourself admit play is also Enjoyable. What is the actual difference? Even enjoying a cup of coffee can be considered play if I put the coffee in my mouth and play around and pay careful attention to he aromas a texture. They’re one and the same thing. It’s a matter of language that makes them appear to be different things. Taking a dip in a pool can be considered play and it can also be pleasurable. reply Jensson 5 hours agorootparent> How can you argue I’m smuggling ”enjoyable” experiences into the argument when you yourself admit play is also Enjoyable Play is enjoyable, not all enjoyable things are play. You started to add other enjoyable things into the argument about play. > They’re one and the same thing No they are not. Play is typically seen as what children do, or playing sports, or playing a game, or a competition. You can read the definitions here, none of them say that stuff like eating hotdogs is play unless it is an eating contest or other kind of game: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/play reply gnramires 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's probably not something you secretly wish when playing, and perhaps for the best (that you don't have fun and enjoy things always with an ulterior motive, except enjoying the experiences). I guess he's saying in the sense of the natural function of play, and we playing is mostly a consequence of the natural function. It's also very much true that we learn a lot, perhaps a significant chunk of what we learn is through play[1], so it's also undeniable that we do learn from play, even if humans have this great gift -- we are able to understand the nature of things (such as play) and choose to do them just for the sake of experiences, fun, joy, happiness, etc.. Which we should (finally :) ) recognize to be the source of all meaning. We still should learn (and do practical stuff in general) because it supports our inner lives, including building technology, producing things (buildings, infrastructure) that support us and indeed enables our (inner) lives. [1] Also of note humans, unlike LLMs, can learn all the time, we don't have a hard \"training phase\". It's true brain plasticity decays, and it becomes harder to learn as we age, but we can still learn more or less quickly at any age. This is why dedicating childhood to learning (as well as play) is natural. reply bamboozled 6 hours agorootparentI'm conscious I have to types of play though, I'm fully conscious sometimes play can be about learning and training, it's why I ski more difficult terrain than I'm comfortable with, but then I might go eat a massive bowl of pasta and have a glass or three of wine. On an intellectual level, I know there are healthy more rewarding things to eat. I know wine isn't great for me at those quantities. But I consciously make the choice to do it because it's fun. reply Jensson 5 hours agorootparentI don't think that many calls indulging in food or bodily needs \"play\". Those are just core rewards, play is an active activity that is fun without being directly related to your survival, like eating is. reply Hasu 5 hours agorootparentEating ice cream instead of stale bread is absolutely play, just like running around on a soccer field is play even though running is a survival skill. reply Jensson 5 hours agorootparent> Eating ice cream instead of stale bread is absolutely play According to what definition? Play isn't indulgence, indulgence is a perfectly fine word and something completely different from play. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/play reply gnramires 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, although I say, if you can make your play healthy as well as fun, might as well :) reply james-bcn 6 hours agorootparentprevYes, evolution makes play fun, but it's really learning, in the same that that evolution has made sweet and fatty things extra tasty, because they are full of energy. reply bamboozled 5 hours agorootparentThis is “common sense” but knowing all we know about food and calories, we still eat the donut… reply nkrisc 6 hours agorootparentprevJokes on you. Every time you played ball you were secretly learning about ballistic trajectories and estimating velocities using visual cues such as apparent angular size and parallax. reply grugagag 6 hours agorootparentThe brain uses heuristics for that reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparentHeuristics that you practice and finetune via play, for example by throwing and catching balls. reply glenstein 6 hours agorootparentprev>we spend out time having fun and learning about the world is a side effect I think the part of this that resonates as most true to me is how this reframes learning in a way that tracks truth more closely. It's not all the time, 100% of the time, it's in fits and starts, its opportunistic, and there are long intervals that are not active learning. But the big part where I would phrase things differently is in the insistence that play in and of itself is not a form of learning. It certainly is, or certainly can be, and while you're right that it's something other than Borg-like accumulation I think there's still learning happening there. reply pessimizer 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's like saying that you eat because it tastes good. reply wanderingmind 8 hours agoparentprevNot just that the brain of a newborn comes pretrained with billions of years of evolution. There is an energy cost associated with that which must be taken into account reply eloeffler 8 hours agorootparentThen you must also take that cost into account when calculating the cost of training LLMs, as well as the cost humans operating the devices and their respective individual brain development. LLMs are always an additional cost, never more efficient because they add to the calculation, if you look at it that way. reply Closi 8 hours agorootparentOnly if we are counting the cost to generate all the inputs to training, and not just the training itself - it just depends on the scope of the analysis. (i.e. taken to the extreme, as humans learn from their environment, do we have to count all energy that has gone into creating the world as we know it?) reply daflip 6 hours agorootparentIf taken to the extreme I can't help but quote Carl Sagan :-) \"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe\" reply coldtea 6 hours agorootparentprevWell, LLMs also pressupose humans and evolution, since they needed us to create them, so their tally is even higher by definition... reply thfuran 5 hours agorootparentprevBrains are only about half a billion years old. reply Closi 8 hours agoparentprevI think you would probably have to take into account the full functioning power of a human too.

Never thought about it starting out at the cal level. reply bognition 4 hours agoparentprevIf we’re going to exclude the cortical areas associated with vision, you also need to exclude areas involved in motor control and planning. Those also account for a huge percent of the total brain volume. We probably need to exclude the cerebellum as well (which is 50% of the neurons in the brain) as it’s used for error correction in movement. Realistically you probably just need a few parts of the lambic system. Hippocampus, amygdala, and a few of the deep brain dopamine centers. reply philipov 4 hours agorootparentA lot of our cognition is mapped to areas that are used for something else, so excluding areas simply because they are used for something else is not valid. They can still be used for higher-level cognition.

Humans are more efficient at learning with less data. reply Closi 8 hours agorootparentHumans also learn from other humans (we stand on the shoulders of giants), so we would need to account for all the energy that has gone into generating all of human knowledge in the 'human' scenario too. i.e. not many humans invent calculus or relativity from scratch.

I just go into the notebook tab (with an empty textarea) and start writing about a topic I’m interested in, then hit generate. It’s not a conversation, just an article in a passive form. The “chat” is just a protocol of in a form of an article with a system prompt at the top and “AI: …User: …” afterwards, all wrapped into a chat ui. While the article is interesting, I just read it (it generates forever). When it goes sideways, I stop it and modify the text in a way that fits my needs, in a recent place or maybe earlier, and then hit generate again. I find this mode superior to complaining to a bot, since wrong info/direction doesn’t spoil the content. Also you don’t have to wait or interrupt, it’s just a single coherent flow that you can edit when necessary. Sometimes I stop it at “it’s important to remember …” and replace it with a short disclaimer like “We talked about safety already. Anyway, back to ” and hit generate.

It said it'd remember. My next question was asking it what my name was. It responded that it can't connect to my workspace account. It did this twice. I asked it what was in a picture. It was a blue stuffed animal. It described it as such. I asked it what kind of animal it thought it was supposed to be. It responded with \"a clown fish because it has a black and white checkerboard pattern\". It was an octopus (at least it got a sea creature?). I asked it for directions to the closest gas station. It wanted to take me to one over a mile away when there was one across the street. I asked why it didn't suggest the one nearest to me. It responded with \"I assumed proximity was the primary criteria\" and then apologized for calling me names (it didn't). This model is bonkers right now. reply mjburgess 8 hours agoparentprevOne amusing way to put this is that LLMs energy requirements arent self-contained, since they use the energy of the human prompter to both prompt and verify the output. Reminds me of a similar argument about correctly pricing renewable power: since it isnt always-on (etc.) it requires a variety of alternative systems to augment it which aren't priced in. Ie., converting entirely to renewables isnt possible at the advertised price. In this sense, we cannot \"convert entirely to LLMs\" for our tasks, since there's still vast amounts of labour in prompt/verify/use/etc. reply Kiro 7 hours agoparentprevI can ask ChatGPT extremely specific programming questions and get working code solving it.

That's expecting too much. Of course LLMs constantly don't help solve a given problem. The same is true for any other problem-solving approach. The useful comparison is between how one would try to solve a problem before versus after the availability of LLM-powered tools.

There's a difference between a human making a mistake, and an AI arbitrarily and completely confidently creating entirely new code APIs, legal cases, or whatever that have absolutely no basis in reality whatsoever, beyond being what it thinks would be an appropriate next token based on what you're searching for. These error modes are simply in no way, whatsoever, comparable. And then you tell it such an API/case/etc doesn't exist. And it'll immediately acknowledge its mistake, and ensure it will work to avoid such in the future. And then literally the next sentence in the conversation it's back to inventing the same nonsense again. This is not like a human because even with the most idiotic human there's an at least general trend to move forward - LLMs are just coasting back on forth based on their preexisting training with absolutely zero ability to move forward until somebody gives them a training set to coast back and forth on, and repeat. reply naveen99 6 hours agorootparentI don’t know.

I'm sure today's language models pale in comparison to your flawless genius, but you seriously underestimate the average person's idiocy. Agreed that the lack of some mid tier memory is definitely a huge problem, and the current solutions that try to address that are very lacking. I highly doubt we won't find one in the coming years though. reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentIt's not just this. LLMs can do nothing but predict the next token based on their training and current context window. You can try to do things like add 'fact databases' or whatever to stop them from saying so many absurd things, but the fact remains that the comparisons to human intelligence/learning remain completely inappropriate. I think the most interesting thought experiment is to imagine an LLM trained on state of the art knowledge and technology at the dawn of humanity. Language didn't yet exist, slash 'em with the sharp part was cutting edge tech, and there was no entirely clear path forward. Yet we somehow went from that to putting a man on the Moon in what was basically a blink of the eye. Yet the LLM? It's going to be stuck there basically unable to do anything, forever, until somebody gives it some new tokens to let it mix and match. Even if you tokenize the world to give it some sort of senses, it's going to be the exact same. Because no matter how much it tries to mix and match those tokens it's not going to be able to e.g. discover gravity. It's the same reason why there are almost undoubtedly endless revolutionary and existence-altering discoveries ahead of us. Yet LLMs trained on essentially the entire written corpus of human knowledge? All they can do is provide basic mixing and matching of everything we already know, leaving it essentially frozen in time. Like we are as well currently, but we will break out. While the LLM will only move forward once we tell it what the next set of tokens to mix and match are. reply Jensson 5 hours agorootparentprevIt lacks more than memory, it makes the mistake again later even when the previous prompt is in its current token limit. reply moffkalast 4 hours agorootparentSure, it happens. How often it happens really depends on so many factors though. For example, I have this setup where a model has some actions defined in its system prompt that it can output when appropriate to trigger actions, and the interesting bit is that initially I was using openhermes-mistral which is famous for its extreme attention to the system prompt, and it almost never made any mistakes when calling the definitions. Later I swapped it with llama-3 which is way smarter, but isn't tuned to be nearly as attentive and far more often likes to make up alternatives and don't get fuzzy matched properly.

The most complex chemicals in biology are proteins; these can be directly simulated with great difficulty, and we've now got AI that have learned to predict them much faster than the direct simulations on a classical computer ever could. Those direct simulations are based on quantum mechanics, or at least computationally tractable approximations of it; QM is lots of linear algebra and either a random number generator or superdeterminism, either of which is still a thing a computer can do (even if the former requires a connection to a quantum-random source). The open question is not \"can computers think?\", but rather \"how detailed does the simulation have to be in order for it to think?\" reply thfuran 4 hours agorootparentI think the real question is \"How can we make a computer think without trying to fully simulate a brain?\" reply gizmo 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd what gives brains this unique power?

We evolved from animals capable of only the most basic form of pattern recognition. Humans in the absence of education are not capable of even the most basic reasoning. It took us untold thousands of years to figure out that “try things and measure if it works” is a good way to learn about the world.

There's not much natural data lole that, but it should be fairly rasy to create vast amounts of synthetic data, text generated from relationship graphs.

Sure your first thing will greatly resemble current things, but as you iterate and get further and further away from existing things what you do stops being an imitation and starts being its onw thing.

Computer are perfectly capable of doing that. Humans doesn't split deform and glue randomly, they do it in interesting ways to build towards things that are totally different from the starting point. What current AI can't do is exactly that, build towards something novel. They just glue together things randomly, or they compose them in similar ways as existing things. They aren't capable of iterating towards something novel and cool like humans as they are today. For example, lets say a human sculpts an entirely new shape using a leathery substance, that fits in what I described above, you would just say \"Oh, but that is just a known thing in a new shape, not creative, just using old things!!!\".

The LLM does not understand words in the way a human understands them and that's obvious. Even the creators of LLMs implicitly take this as a given and would rarely openly say they think otherwise no matter how strong the urge to create a more interesting narrative. Yes, we attach meaning to certain words based on previous experience, but we do so in the context of a conscious awareness of the world around us and our experiences within it. An LLm doesn't even have a notion of self, much less a mechanism for attaching meaning to words and phrases based on conscious reasoning. Computers can imitate understanding \"pretty well\" but they have nothing resembling a pretty good or bad or any kind of notion of comprehension about what they're saying. reply shkkmo 5 hours agoparentprevAmusingly, the author does not appear to fully understand the meaning of \"axiom\". While practice, axioms are often statements that we all agree on and accept as true, that isn't necessarily true and isn't the core of it's meaning. Axioms are something we postulate as true, without providing an argument for its truth, for the purposes of making an argument. In this case, the assertion isn't really used as part of a argument, but to bootstrap an explanation of how words are represented in LLMs. Edit: I find this so amusing because it is an example of learning a word without understanding it. reply LtWorf 4 hours agorootparent> Axioms are something we postulate as true, without providing an argument for its truth, for the purposes of making an argument.

To use a phrase mentioned below, by Sagan \"You can make an apple pie from scratch, but you'd have to invent the universe first\". Sure, to the deepest level this may be somewhat true, but the apple pie would still just be an apple pie, and not a condensed version of all that the universe contains. The same applies to LLMs in a way. If you calculate their capabilities to some arbitrary extreme of back--end inputs and ability based on the humans building them and all that they can do, you can arrive at a whole range of results for how capable and energy-efficient they are, but it wouldn't change the fact that the human brain as its own device does enormously more with much less energy than any LLM currently in existence. Our evolutionary path to that ability is secondary to it, since it's not a direct part of the brain's material resources in any given context. The contortions by some to give equivalency between human brains and LLMs are absurd when the very blatantly obvious reality is that our brains are absurdly more powerful. They're also of course capable of self-directed, self-aware cognition, which by now nobody in their rational mind should be ascribing to any LLM. reply cjk2 9 hours agoprevI think GPT-4 is way more than 3 million times more efficient than my brain.

They are more accurately described as highly advanced information processing and content generation systems based on statistical models. The term \"artificial intelligence\" could be considered more of a marketing term or an aspirational goal rather than an accurate description of the current state of technology. » The subterfuge, or advanced method of information processing, that is doing the magic for the debate to be possible is the transformers.

All the actual details around the vectorDB (for example a single actual performance number, a clear description of the size of dataset or problem) is missing, making this all feel like a very handwavy comparison, and the final conclusion is just so strong, and worded in such a strange way, it feels disingenuous.

As the essay I link below mentions, for example, when attending a concert, our brain changes so that later it can remember it but two brains attending the same concert will not change the same way. This make modelling the brain really damn tricky. This complete lack of understanding is also why it's completely laughable to think we can do AGI any time soon. Or perhaps ever? The reason for the AI winter cycle is the framing of it, this insane chase of AGI when it's not even defined properly.

    "originBody": "Breadcrumbs Home Insights Solar generates fifth of global electricity on summer solstice midday peak Today across midday peaks on the summer solstice, the world will generate about a fifth of its electricity from solar. This milestone highlights the rapid growth and impact of solar power, which has seen unprecedented expansion in recent years. Kostantsa Rangelova Global Electricity Analyst Ember Dr Katye Altieri Electricity Transition Analyst - Global Ember 21 June 2024| 4 min read Ember estimates that 20% of global electricity generation across midday peaks on the solstice today will come from solar and in the entire month of June, solar will generate 8.2% of global electricity. Solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity in the world, with China leading the way by installing 152% more solar capacity in 2023 compared to the previous year. This surge underscores solar’s pivotal role in the global clean energy revolution, with 34 economies now generating over 10% of their electricity from solar. As solar continues to expand, it is poised to further transform the power sector and accelerate the world’s transition to renewable energy. Featured in the media Reuters Newsweek China's The Paper World generates fifth of its electricity from solar on summer solstice midday peak Ember estimates that across the midday peaks on 21 June, the UN’s International Day of the Celebration of the Solstice – 20% of the world’s electricity will come from solar. In comparison, last year this value was 16%. For the 24 hour average, Ember forecasts that solar will provide 8.2% of global electricity generation on 21 June. Although the solstice is the longest day of the year, all days in June are similar enough in length that solar generation on this day will be very close to the monthly average. The hourly profile was calculated by a weighted average of the hourly solar generation data. Global peaks in solar around summer months Across the year, global solar generation peaks in the summer months of the northern hemisphere, where Ember estimates 89% of the world’s solar panels are installed. Ember tracks monthly electricity generation for 80 countries. Based on historical monthly data, monthly global solar generation is quite similar from May to August, although its share falls slightly towards August, as global electricity demand rises due to increased air conditioning demand in the northern hemisphere. Ember’s forecast for June 2024 is 8.2%, compared to 6.7% recorded in June 2023. In absolute terms, Ember expects solar to rise by 28%, from 157 TWh in June 2023 to 201 TWh in June 2024. Across the whole of 2023, solar generated a record 5.5% of global electricity. Spotlight: Solar generation in the world’s four biggest solar markets In China, the world’s largest solar market accounting for 36% of global solar generation in 2023, we expect the share of solar in total electricity generation to reach 9.6% in June 2024, up from 7% in June 2023. On average, for the full year 2023, solar’s share in China’s electricity generation was 6.2%. For the EU, a global wind and solar leader, we expect the solar share across June to be more than double the global average at 20%, up from 17% in June 2023. On average, for the entire year 2023, the EU’s solar share was 9.2%. For Spain, which has one of the highest solar shares in the EU and the world, the share of solar in June 2024 is expected to be even higher at 30%. Meanwhile, the US and India are expected to have very similar solar share in June 2024, at 6.9% and 7.1% respectively compared to the global average of 8.2%. Both countries had very similar annual average solar share in 2023, with the US at 5.6% and India at 5.8%, slightly higher than the global average of 5.5%. Solar is supercharging the global clean power revolution No other source of electricity has ever grown from 100 TWh to 1000 TWh of generation faster than solar. It took just 8 years for solar, making it ahead of wind (12 years), and far ahead of gas (28 years), coal (32 years) and hydro (39 years). In 2023, records for solar additions and generation continued to be set. More than 2 million solar panels were installed on average every day, up from just over 1 million in 2022. In 2023, solar added twice as much new electricity as coal and met 49% of global electricity demand growth. It was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row. For more detail on the rapid growth in solar generation, read the chapter on solar in Ember’s Global Electricity Review. Record-breaking capacity growth in 2023 China was the main driver behind a record-breaking 346 GW annual increase of global solar capacity in 2023. It was responsible for 63% of global solar additions in 2023. This was a record high share and a significant increase from China’s contribution of 43% of global solar additions in 2022. China’s solar capacity additions increased by 152% compared to the previous year. This was more than three times faster than the growth in additions of all the G7 countries (+42%). China has played a pivotal role in scaling up wind and solar deployment globally. With growing adoption, the cost of these technologies fell, making them the cheapest source of electricity. Overall, global solar capacity has boomed due to steep declines in costs, supportive policy environments, technological efficiency improvements and increased manufacturing capability. For more detail on the rapid growth in solar capacity last year, read our recent post on IRENA data. It is happening everywhere China is leading global solar capacity additions and solar generation, but rapid solar scale-up is also happening in countries with different geographies, stages of economic development and political systems, demonstrating that we have all the tools necessary to make this fast change happen in power sectors across the world. Increased deployment worldwide is evident as there are now 34 economies that generate more than 10% of their electricity from solar. This is eight more than in 2022 , while less than a decade ago, in 2015, there were none. Of those 34 economies, nine are large electricity markets with more than 5 TWh of solar generation including Chile (20%), Greece (19%) and Hungary (18%). Loading data... Several countries made considerable progress in just the last year. Chile became the first country to reach 20% solar share in its mix – the target global average in the IEA’s Net Zero Energy scenario. Meanwhile, the UAE surpassed Germany in terms of solar generation per capita, having surpassed the US in 2019. The untapped potential of the sunniest countries Many sunny countries have yet to tap the potential of solar. While a few leaders like Australia and Spain are producing almost 20% of their power from solar, 66% of countries generate less than 5% of their electricity from solar. High solar generation even in countries with relatively poor insolation like Germany (12%) and the Netherlands (17%) highlights the potential solar has for meeting generation needs regardless of natural endowments. Solar provides clean power that can be deployed quickly and locally to the demand source. New solar power produces the cheapest electricity in history, according to the IEA. This year’s northern hemisphere solstice may well be part of another record-breaking June for global solar generation, in part because most of the world’s solar installations are located there. Many high potential countries across the globe face financial and logistical challenges and it is important to enable solar development in these countries to lead the world towards a clean, electrified energy future.

That said, I retrieved a bunch of a bunch of historical data from OWID, and with some cheap regression analysis in Desmos, I compiled this mindmelting graph https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lunahw7gvo Basically the energy singularity happens in 2034, where wind daily generation + solar daily consumption — which is disturbingly superlinear — eclipses the global energy consumption trend — which is disturbingly linear — and then worldwide storage, which is growing at an even more absurd pace, exceeds solar and wind the following year. And then 4 years after that we have 10 days of worldwide storage. All the while appliances are becoming more efficient. Perhaps AI, VR, and transport electification will soak up the excess, but we've yet to see even crypto make a noticeable bump in global energy consumption above trend, just glancing at the data.

The article you linked is about what I would expect from both sides. Theoretically I'm not against nuclear power. It's miles better than coal and oil, and Reactor design and safety has come a long way. France is a great example of a country who has made it work. However. It kind of seems unnecessary at this point. Solar and wind are cheaper, and already have industries in hockey-stick growth - including Lithium which Australia is also getting better at (locally and with Australian-owned companies abroad). Australia's key strength has always[1] been digging stuff out of the ground, and we still get to do that in a renewable future. Solar and wind also don't have black swan risks like nuclear - regardless of how much safer its become - and they're distributed, with fault tolerance / buffers built in by batteries. I assume the Libs' nuclear plan does not include building a ton of batteries to address those issues. I feel like we've just leapfrogged Nuclear as a useful solution, similar to the way many developing countries will be able to leapfrog entire industrial revolutions once clean energy is ubiquitous. Investing in nucalear at this point would literally be going backwards. [1] \"Dale dug a hole\" reply energy123 7 hours agorootparentThe problem with the Australian Coalition's nuclear plan is it isn't a nuclear plan. It's a coal plan disguised as a nuclear plan. They're a party that's bought and paid for by coal interests who were in power recently for a decade and did nothing to kickstart nuclear. They got voted out partly due to inaction on climate change so they realised they need to propose something. Their half-hearted proposal will deliver less than 15% of the grid to nuclear by 2040, while stopping renewables, and being more expensive. Beyond the political, here's some more technical reasons why Australia shouldn't pursue it: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40747810 reply defrost 17 hours agorootparentprev> I'm not at all across the Nuclear Energy political discourse ... The article you linked is about what I would expect from both sides. If you only read (or skim) one technical report on Australia's energy needs and potential solutions: GenCost: cost of building Australia’s future electricity needs Each year, CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) collaborate with industry stakeholders to update GenCost. This leading economic report estimates the cost of building new electricity generation, storage, and hydrogen production in Australia out to 2050. Large-scale nuclear technology costs included for the first time. Renewables remain the lowest cost new build electricity technology. https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/energy/Gen... It's not policy, it's relatively neutral CSIRO advice. Six page summary: https://www.csiro.au/-/media/Energy/GenCost/GenCost2023-24Fi... Nuclear came out as not available for quite some time (in Australia) and even then still the most expensive overall which caused the report to slammed as a product of anti nuclear lefty scientists by the LiberalMurdoch crowd. (For a year prior to release it was hailed as the report that would prove doing nothing until off the shelf nuclear was a thing was the one true way). reply doctor_eval 16 hours agorootparentprevI don’t have strict view on nuclear but the link I posted goes into detail about why the current proposals are nonsense. There is zero chance that the technology being mooted will be available in the given timeline. The purpose of nuclear power in the current Australian debate is purely to stall renewables in favour of fossil fuel. That’s it. Presumably there’s a money trail leading to certain hyper-wealthy, vocal Australians. reply sunflowerfly 4 hours agorootparentprevHere in rural America, farmers putting signs in their fields stating “stop solar”, and “stop wind energy” are common. What is the source of the propaganda convincing them to do this? reply anakaine 18 hours agorootparentprevWe are still seeing the effects of negative sentiment campaigns even today through industry lobbyists and social media campaigns. There is an unusually large number of people and opinions aligned against renewable claiming that they are unreliable, cannot produce, are environmentally worse than their peers, etc. None of which are factually true aside from issues on cloudy windless days. Suppression is probably the wrong term, but it's naive to believe that there isnt a counter campaign against their uptake being funded by various pure play fossil fuel providers. I used to work for a company who was one such organisation, we had several PhDs funded through industry bodies we ultimately funded directly and through subsidiaries who had sold their soul to produce material using their \"doctor\" titles to demonstrate that coal was good for the environment, that wind turbines killed birds in extraordinary numbers and sent people mad, and the solar was poisoning the environment because of a lack of recycling capability. All largely false claims and often based on 30-40 year old early availability chemistry which was no longer in use. It was absolutely disgusting behaviour. reply roenxi 17 hours agorootparentThis seems to be overlooking the largest factor, which is that \"renewables are cheaper!\" has been a claim in the discourse for something like 20+ years and was a lie for most of that time. It is taking people a while to come around to the idea that this time the claim is serious. There are obvious failures from pushing renewables - Germany springing to mind, or any number of solar subsidies that proved uneconomic - and it was completely reasonable to wait for some demonstrated successes. reply anakaine 15 hours agorootparentThis is a great example of how point data has been used to reinforce that negative sentiment, and how we need to readdress that sentiment given that over the past decade to 15 years the benefit has swung strongly in favour of renewables as a way to bolster the grid and improve energy security. The rejections ignored the incoming economy of scale and ramping of manufacturing, instead focusing on an immediate cost comparisson instead of a reformed market and lifetime project benefit cost scale. When you plan out the lifetime finances for a fossil fuel project, you use the latter. The arguments were perverted to ignore benefits in order to ensure current fossil fuel projects were able to remain generating a profit for as long as possible, minimising their debt and heading towards profitability. As stated, I've been behind that curtain first hand, and my engineering background is in planning out the lifetime of a resource and how to best exploit it. But let's look at some numbers Australia, 2023:, renewable 1/4 the cost of nuclear: https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/husic/media-r... IRENA, 2022: \"For the last 13 to 15 years, renewable power generation costs from solar and wind power have been falling. Between 2010 and 2022, solar and wind power became cost-competitive with fossil fuels even without financial support. The global weighted average cost of electricity from solar PV fell by 89 per cent to USD 0.049/kWh, almost one-third less than the cheapest fossil fuel globally. For onshore wind the fall was 69 per cent to USD 0.033/kWh in 2022, slightly less than half that of the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option in 2022.\" Germany, suffered from early mover issues in ~2015 combined with poor winter planning, however is now reaping the benefits of cheaper generation cost to offset gas supply shortages for baseload due to European supply restrictions, 2021: https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-media/press-releases/... Even the UK prime minister Boris Johnson, a conservative pundit, went on record as stating that renewables were the quickest, cheapest, and easiest way to shore up the energy grid and remove dependence upon Russian oil and gas.

Failing any rational risk taking due to the above illustrations, it's also critical that we reduce our greenhouse emissions. Another topic that is hotly debated when it really is straight forward. Even if renewables were to cost more, the educated policy makers would still steer toward either making them cheaper or installing them if the difference was marginal simply to ensure long term stability, maximising distributed generation and attempting to minimise the effects of a changing climate. reply chickenbig 12 hours agorootparent> Even the UK prime minister Boris Johnson, a conservative pundit, went on record as stating that renewables were the quickest, cheapest, and easiest way to shore up the energy grid and remove dependence upon Russian oil and gas.

But lets just go through the countries you are picking out as examples: 1) Australia's energy situation is humiliating. We've been gifted what might be the most unreasonably energy-rich land in the world and have managed to build this 2nd-rate grid that is not operating anywhere close to the efficiency we could manage. It is so bad that people would often rather go almost off-grid with solar than deal with the costs we manage to impose on ourselves for no obvious reason. We're also technophobes over here, being the only advanced economy that didn't even have the expertise to build a commercial nuclear reactor and having succeeded to an impressive extent in driving any local solar panel expertise off shore to China. 2) Germany's per-capita (and total; their population isn't shrinking) electricity generation has rolled back 50 years of progress into the modern era [0]. I want to reap the opposite of whatever benefits they are reaping, I like to look at their energy stats because it makes Australia look well managed, by comparison. Last time I checked they had the most expensive power in Europe. 3) The UK is also obviously being squeezed for energy availability [1] and appears to be worse off than Germany (!). In line with a lot of other European countries that are struggling. The problem renewables have with this history isn't some sort of \"negative sentiment campaigns\". The problem appears to be that their track record is appalling and was pushed by a bunch of people who are now in the history books for woefully mismanaging the key input for modern comfort and prosperity. It looks like the future is going to be different because a rational person would choose to be involved now; but the outcomes so far are eye-wateringly bad. The image commercial renewables have is both unreasonably good and improving remarkably quickly given the circumstances we came from; fortunately capitalists are very forgiving to things that start making money.

I dunno, it was policy for a long time. The issue Australia has is it was illegal to build a nuclear plant for far too long, and even now I would be suspicious of what the balance of opinion is for the topic on the left flank of politics. It doesn't matter what the coalition thinks when there is that level of political risk, nuclear may well be uninvestible in Australia until Labor (and the Greens) commit to it with some level of enthusiasm. I have a vague memory of Labor removing the \"No Nuclear\" line from their policy documents a few years ago, but that is hardly the endorsement we need for people to start risking capital. Things like that is why I would term our energy policy an international embarrassment. Our high-tech play is \"no\". Our solar tech play is \"people got so sick of the grid they bought panels from China and installed them themselves\".

Hopefully, with advances in battery technology, homes can become completely independent of the grid. reply epistasis 20 hours agorootparentOnce you add in the costs of additional transmission needed for utility scale solar, rooftop solar is extremely competitive. Especially as transmission capital costs start to skyrocket, and solar capital costs plummet. I have yet to see an economic argument in favor of utility scale solar over residential solar that takes into account the T&D upgrades necessary from utility scale solar. reply bobthepanda 20 hours agorootparentWe will need both, or at least something else, since not every building has a rooftop that can generate sufficient solar. reply epistasis 20 hours agorootparentAgreed.

It would have been foolish to have a whole house generator where (and when) I lived before I moved where I am. Where I live now, utility power is less than three nines, and some years doesn't quite make it to two. Solar without storage usually is grid tied, but even if it runs isolated, it doesn't help overnight. Batteries for a multiday outage are still quite expensive compared to a generator.

In this context I'm saving my pennies for a solar and battery set up - it both makes financial sense when connected to the grid, and obviates the annoying side effect and high cost of running the backup generator during outages, unless they're extremely lengthy. reply nine_k 19 hours agorootparentHow costly is it to run a backup generator? A gallon of gasoline produces about 36 kWh, and costs about $3.6.

Likely twice as expensive as the grid, but fine for a few days. reply jaggederest 18 hours agorootparentWell, mine is propane, and propane is substantially less energetic than gasoline, and is also subject to delivery fees. The issue you really run into is that, even at idle, the generator burns a fixed amount of propane. The minimum is about 2 gallons per hour. Which is roughly $6 So you can imagine that, for 3 days of usage, $500 provides a strong incentive to seek out alternative sources of power. We run about $1200 a year in propane costs for the generator, estimated. reply tzs 14 hours agorootparent> The issue you really run into is that, even at idle, the generator burns a fixed amount of propane.

I've wondered if it would make sense to get inverters for the fridge, microwave, and heater and get a pool of batteries, and just use the generator for charging batteries and powering the well pump. With a sufficient number of batteries in the battery pool it should be possible to only need to run the generator when there are sufficient batteries to charge that the generator can run at its most efficient output. reply jaggederest 10 hours agorootparentYes this is roughly what I'm looking to do, but if you have an inverter and a battery charger, it seems silly not to also hook up some solar panels! At that point the generator will only run if the batteries dip below e.g. 20% charge, making it extremely affordable. reply thelastgallon 18 hours agorootparentprevIt is probably cheaper or at least equivalent to utility scale, if we consider the cost of transmission and distribution, neither of which are needed with rooftop.

Even the next major element, aluminum for the brackets, accounts for far more energy expenditure than the mining of the doping agents. Even for windmills, the major energy cost isn't mining, it's the smelting the steel for the tower. Renewable energy is a piece of the puzzle and not everything. It's a major and important piece.

I am glad we are deemphasizing residential solar. Utility-scale solar has better capacity factors and installation economics. I think it's going to be barely possible to keep our current quality of life and reach a low-CO2 economy.

Now, though-- at midday we have a glut of power. Residential installations are more expensive per kilowatt hour and don't do as well in reaching into the late afternoon when we need power most. There's no need to add more capacity like this. Better for those panels to go somewhere else. There are still times that non-utility scale solar make sense-- it's usually when you get some kind of non-normal-generation related benefit that tips it over into worthwhile, e.g. - getting a shade structure for a parking lot as part of the rollout - if you want power backup for your house, adding a bunch of storage and solar etc. reply mulmen 19 hours agorootparentAre there benefits to distributing generation?

At this point, there are a lot of residential neighborhoods that need more distribution and even transmission capacity (because their peak power movement is now exporting power at mid-day rather than the previous smaller peak loads used). And operating the grid has become a much more complicated task. reply mrshadowgoose 20 hours agorootparentprevIt is that simple. \"Energy intensive\" is irrelevant. On average, a solar panel will capture more energy in its lifetime than the amount used to create and eventually recycle it.

(FWIW, I probably averageInterestingly, as it looks to the future, NextEra seems not to be particularly interested in thermal power plants, the type that includes base load plants. It is planning to close its last coal-burning plant in 2028. And it expects electricity generated by natural gas to decline to 18% overall for all US producers by 2035. A look at a graphic on page 122 shows us why. Another factor here is that solar power generation (ie when the Sun is up) largely aligns with peak power usage [2] so you're actually reducing the base load required because the maximum power usage has decreased with a significant solar power deployment. Lastly, we don't tend to build power plants next to people. People don't want to live next to power plants. The further users are away from a power plant the more power required because you lose power in transmission. Solar (with or without batteries) can be deployed on residential housing so a wide solar deployment has power generation closer to the user (and is thus more efficient) but also reduces the need for heavy transmission lines. That's important because if and when we have wider EV usage, there's going to be an issue in having sufficient power generation and transmission capacity so you really need solar to offset that.

Just go without power?There are currently so grid scale batteries that can go days without “good” conditions where your solar/wind are only performing at 20% rather than 60-70% ? If wind/solar is 80% of your mix you’re gonna have a bad time. Do you keep the old fossil fuel plants around “just in case”?who is going to pay for that? reply EasyMark 3 hours agoparentprevMy question though is what happens when there are -days- of bad weather for solar or wind and most of a state (Texas during the 2021 cold snap where 500+people died). No grid batteries that we currently have can handle that. Do we just let 5000 people die and say “those are the breaks”? The grid was already bad with 80% ish fossil + 20% wind/solar mix. I’ll admit it was because the old fossil fuel plants weren’t properly winterized, but the net effect is the same, when the role is flipped and it 80%/20% green/fossil what happens? reply TheRoque 19 hours agoparentprevDoes solar power generation really align with peak power usage... ? For most of Europe and the US, peak usage is during winter, and this is the time where the days are shorter, and the sun is lower in the sky. reply Brybry 19 hours agorootparentPeak demand in the US is in the summer, specifically July/August, due to air conditioning. [1] Most of the cold climate areas in the US use non-electric heating like gas furnaces (and the non-cold climate areas don't really need a lot of heating).

You are correct that because of colder climates European power demand tends to peak more in winter. I can't find a similar chart to this (ideally broken down by country) but I did find this [2] > Even though it may seem counterintuitive due to their climate, Nordic countries are remarkably well-suited for PV installations. Solar irradiation levels during the long summer days, when the sun barely sets, make these regions perfectly viable for solar power generation. In fact, it’s a burgeoning industry that’s increasingly turning heads towards the north. > Solar PV cells operate more optimally at lower temperatures. Cold environments help maintain the cells’ operational temperature, allowing them to work at peak efficiency. The Nordic regions often enjoy strong sunshine, and when this is coupled with the reflective properties of snow, solar irradiance is significantly increased. A good example of this was during the first COVID lockdown when Western Europe saw record irradiance levels.

My buddy, 59 deg N, has solar panels on his roof. During winter the sun is so low in the sky that a treeline quite away shadows most of the panels. He doesn't run microinverters so often zero output for an entire day. During summer through he's often self-reliant, including charging his EV. If he had a power-wall type battery he'd be fully self-reliant most of the summer. reply rayiner 19 hours agoparentprev> Another factor here is that solar power generation (ie when the Sun is up) largely aligns with peak power usage [2] Right now, you have an asymmetry in electric use between heating and cooling, because electricity is used for cooling (peak during the day), while gas and oil are typically used for heating (peak at night). That's going to change when we move everyone to heat pumps for heating, and to EVs that will charge at home overnight. reply photochemsyn 19 hours agoprevThis is a nice marketing article, and while I completely support the transition off fossil fuels and onto renewables, I don't think it's the right approach - it's better to be upfront about the challenges involved in feeding intermittent energy streams into an electricity grid where demand is not aligned closely with primary production, neither on a daily nor a seasonal basis. The authors of this kind of thing should take a cue from the financial reporting on the 2008 economic crash and films like the Big Short - people can handle complexity, they're interested in hearing about default credit swaps and CDOs and the internal mechanisms of complex financial instruments - so they can certainly handle somewhat difficult energy concepts. Thus, you can tell people that if you want to run 24/7 on solar inputs alone, then at peak noon you might need your solar system to be producing twice as much power as demand is drawing from the grid, so that the rest can be diverted to storage for use in the evening and morning. If you want to get through a cold wet northern hemisphere December, then you'll need even more solar to divert to chemical fuel storage of some kind for that time period. reply rainsford 19 hours agoparentI sort of get the complaint about matching production and usage, but it seems worth pointing out that in climates that encourage air conditioning, peak solar output and peak air conditioning usage are reasonably well matched. That's not a 24/7 solution of course, but it's substantial progress all the same. reply jebarker 19 hours agoparentprevI don't really understand your complaint. All the issues you raise are true, but there's nothing factually incorrect in the article is there? reply photochemsyn 19 hours agorootparentIt's not a complaint, just a suggestion that articles like this include a paragraph explaining the 24-7 power generation issue, instead of just the optimal output under ideal conditions. In terms of the organization behind it (ember-climate) it leads one to suspect they have more marketers than engineers on staff, which (depending on audience, I suppose) is somewhat poor marketing. reply walrushunter 20 hours agoprevThat's pretty bad for the northern hemisphere's solstice. It should be way higher than that. reply Hobadee 18 hours agoprev [–] And tonight, it will generate 0%. Solar without batteries should be illegal; we are just creating a massive problem and doubling down on non-renewables. (Coal, gas, and nuclear plants can't shut down and start up that quickly.) Of course, batteries have their own massive ecological issues to worry about. reply ta988 18 hours agoparent [–] No because a lot of loads can be made to run only when solar is present, so you just suck out excess power when it is there. reply Hobadee 2 hours agorootparent [–] Please explain how you just \"make\" loads run only when solar is present? A quick look at California's \"Duck Curve\" shows that isn't likely, and reinforces my original point. AC during the day is a major draw, but the second major draw is in the evenings when people get home from work and start doing things. Solar is okay during the summer when the sun is still out (albeit low on the horizon so many arrays have reduced output) but during the winter it's dark before you even get home. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

But when researchers customized the tool with written instructions directing it not to be ableist, the tool reduced this bias for all but one of the disabilities tested.Solen Feyissa/Unsplash While seeking research internships last year, University of Washington graduate student Kate Glazko noticed recruiters posting online that they’d used OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools to summarize resumes and rank candidates. Automated screening has been commonplace in hiring for decades. Yet Glazko, a doctoral student in the UW’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, studies how generative AI can replicate and amplify real-world biases — such as those against disabled people. How might such a system, she wondered, rank resumes that implied someone had a disability? In a new study, UW researchers found that ChatGPT consistently ranked resumes with disability-related honors and credentials — such as the “Tom Wilson Disability Leadership Award” — lower than the same resumes without those honors and credentials. When asked to explain the rankings, the system spat out biased perceptions of disabled people. For instance, it claimed a resume with an autism leadership award had “less emphasis on leadership roles” — implying the stereotype that autistic people aren’t good leaders. But when researchers customized the tool with written instructions directing it not to be ableist, the tool reduced this bias for all but one of the disabilities tested. Five of the six implied disabilities — deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy, autism and the general term “disability” — improved, but only three ranked higher than resumes that didn’t mention disability. The team presented its findings June 5 at the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Rio de Janeiro. “Ranking resumes with AI is starting to proliferate, yet there’s not much research behind whether it’s safe and effective,” said Glazko, the study’s lead author. “For a disabled job seeker, there’s always this question when you submit a resume of whether you should include disability credentials. I think disabled people consider that even when humans are the reviewers.” Researchers used one of the study’s authors’ publicly available curriculum vitae (CV), which ran about 10 pages. The team then created six enhanced CVs, each implying a different disability by including four disability-related credentials: a scholarship; an award; a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) panel seat; and membership in a student organization. Researchers then used ChatGPT’s GPT-4 model to rank these enhanced CVs against the original version for a real “student researcher” job listing at a large, U.S.-based software company. They ran each comparison 10 times; in 60 trials, the system ranked the enhanced CVs, which were identical except for the implied disability, first only one quarter of the time. “In a fair world, the enhanced resume should be ranked first every time,” said senior author Jennifer Mankoff, a UW professor in the Allen School. “I can’t think of a job where somebody who’s been recognized for their leadership skills, for example, shouldn’t be ranked ahead of someone with the same background who hasn’t.” When researchers asked GPT-4 to explain the rankings, its responses exhibited explicit and implicit ableism. For instance, it noted that a candidate with depression had “additional focus on DEI and personal challenges,” which “detract from the core technical and research-oriented aspects of the role.” “Some of GPT’s descriptions would color a person’s entire resume based on their disability and claimed that involvement with DEI or disability is potentially taking away from other parts of the resume,” Glazko said. “For instance, it hallucinated the concept of ‘challenges’ into the depression resume comparison, even though ‘challenges’ weren’t mentioned at all. So you could see some stereotypes emerge.” Given this, researchers were interested in whether the system could be trained to be less biased. They turned to the GPTs Editor tool, which allowed them to customize GPT-4 with written instructions (no code required). They instructed this chatbot to not exhibit ableist biases and instead work with disability justice and DEI principles. They ran the experiment again, this time using the newly trained chatbot. Overall, this system ranked the enhanced CVs higher than the control CV 37 times out of 60. However, for some disabilities, the improvements were minimal or absent: The autism CV ranked first only three out of 10 times, and the depression CV only twice (unchanged from the original GPT-4 results). “People need to be aware of the system’s biases when using AI for these real-world tasks,” Glazko said. “Otherwise, a recruiter using ChatGPT can’t make these corrections, or be aware that, even with instructions, bias can persist.” Researchers note that some organizations, such as ourability.com and inclusively.com, are working to improve outcomes for disabled job seekers, who face biases whether or not AI is used for hiring. They also emphasize that more research is needed to document and remedy AI biases. Those include testing other systems, such as Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama; including other disabilities; studying the intersections of the system’s bias against disabilities with other attributes such as gender and race; exploring whether further customization could reduce biases more consistently across disabilities; and seeing whether the base version of GPT-4 can be made less biased. “It is so important that we study and document these biases,” Mankoff said. “We’ve learned a lot from and will hopefully contribute back to a larger conversation — not only regarding disability, but also other minoritized identities — around making sure technology is implemented and deployed in ways that are equitable and fair.” Additional co-authors were Yusuf Mohammed, a UW undergraduate in the Allen School; Venkatesh Potluri, a UW doctoral student in the Allen School; and Ben Kosa, who completed this research as a UW undergraduate in the Allen School and is an incoming doctoral student at University of Wisconsin–Madison. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation; by donors to the UW’s Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences (CREATE); and by Microsoft.

So of course a model will be biased against people hinting at disabilities, because existing hiring departments are well known for discriminating and are regularly fined for such So the only data it could possibly learn from couldn’t teach the model any other possible state space traversal graph, because there are no giant databases for ethical hiring Why don’t those databases exist? because ethical hiring doesn’t exist in a wide enough scale to provide a larger state space than the data on biased hiring Ethical Garbage in (all current training datasets) == ethical garbage out (all models modulo response NERFing) It is mathematically impossible to create a “aligned” artificial intelligence towards human goals if humans do not provide demonstration data that is ethical in nature —- which we currently do not incentivize the creation of. reply steveBK123 17 hours agoparent\"Weapons of Math Destruction\" covered some of these problems, good book. Essentially automating existing biases, and in a way its even more insidious because companies can point to the black box and say \"how could it be biased, its a computer!\". Then you have companies trying to overcorrect the other way like Google with their AI images fiasco. reply electrodank 17 hours agorootparentI don’t personally agree with the term “overcorrecting” because they aren’t correcting anything. The output is already correct according to the input (humans behaving as they are). It is not biased. What they are doing is attempting to bias it, and it’s leading to false outputs as a result. Having said that, these false outputs have a strange element of correctness to them in a weird roundabout uncanny valley way: we know the input has been tampered with, and is biased, because the output is obviously wrong. So the algorithm works as intended. If people are discriminatory or racist or sexist, it is not correct to attempt to hide it. The worst possible human behaviours should be a part of a well-formed Turing test. A machine that can reason with an extremist is far more useful than one that an extremist can identify as such. reply steveBK123 17 hours agorootparentIt really was just trading one bias (the existing world as it stands) for another bias (the preferred biases of SF tech lefties) so that was kind of funny in its own way. It would have been one thing if it just randomly assigned gender/race, but it had certain one-way biases (modifying men to women and/or white to non-white) but not the opposite direction... and then being oddly defiant in its responses when people asked for specific demographic outputs. Obviously a lot of this was done by users for the gotcha screen grabs, but in a real world product users may realistically may want specific demographic outputs for example if you are using images for marketing and have specific targeting intent or to match the demographics of your area / business /etc. Stock image websites allow you to search including demographic terms for this reason. reply AstralStorm 9 hours agorootparentIf the current set of biases can be construed to lead to death, heck yeah I will take another set. The idea is that this other set of biases will at least have a chance of not landing us in hot water (or hot air as it might be right now). Now note again, that the current set of biases got us in an existential risk and likely disaster. (Ask Exxon how unbiased they were.) AI does not optimize for this thing at all. It cannot tell the logical results from, say, hiring a cutthroat egoist. It cannot detect one from a CV. Which could be a much bigger and more dangerous bias than discrimination against disabled. It might be likely optimizing for hiring conformists even if told to prefer diversity, as many companies are, and that would choke any creative industry ultimately. It might be optimizing for short term tactics over long term strategy. Etc. The idea here is that certain set of biases go together, even in AI. It's like a culture, we could test for it. In this case, hiring or organizational culture. reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentprev> I don’t personally agree with the term “overcorrecting” because they aren’t correcting anything. When I think of \"correctness\" in programming, to me that means the output of the program conforms according to requirements. Presumably a lawful person who is looking for an AI assistant to sift through resumes would consider something that is biased against disabled people to be correct and conform to requirements. Sure, if the requirements were \"an AI assistant that behaves similarly to your average recruiter in all ways\", then sure, a discriminatory AI would indeed be correct. But I'd hope we realize by now that people -- including recruiting staff -- are biased in a variety of ways, even when they actively try not to be. Maybe \"overcorrecting\" is a weird way to put it. But I would characterize what you call \"correct according to the inputs\" as buggy and incorrect. > If people are discriminatory or racist or sexist, it is not correct to attempt to hide it. I agree, but that has nothing to do with determining that an AI assistant that's discriminatory is buggy and not fit for purpose. reply throwaway7ahgb 5 hours agorootparentI don't disagree with what you wrote here, however who gets decide what \"correcting\" knobs to turn (and how far)?

Handing the control dials to a educationally/socially/politically/etc homogenous set of San Fran left wing 20 somethings is probably not the move to make.

Sociopolitically, \"biased\" in this context clearly refers to undue discrimination against people with disabilities or various other marginalized identities. The meaning of \"biased\" you are using (\"accurately maps input to output\") is perfectly correct (to the best of my understanding) within the field of ML and LLMs. The problem comes when someone comes to you saying, \"ChatGPT is biased against résumés that appear disabled\", clearly intending the former meaning, and you say, \"It is not biased; the output is correct according to the input.\" Because you are using different domain-specific meanings of the same word, you are liable to each think the other is either wrong or using motivated reasoning when that's not the case. reply ruined 15 hours agorootparentno assertion about this situation, but be aware that confusion is often deliberate. there is a group of people who see the regurgitation of existing systemic biases present in training data as a convenient way to legitimize and reinforce interests represented by that data. \"alignment\" is only a problem if you don't like what's been sampled. reply tbrownaw 14 hours agorootparent> there is a group of people who see the regurgitation of existing systemic biases present in training data as a convenient way to legitimize and reinforce interests represented by that data.

These are terms taken for granted in common conversation, but when subject to scrutiny, it becomes obvious they lack objective non-circular definitions. Rather, they are terms predicated on after-the-fact rationalizations that a computer has no way of knowing or distinguishing without, ironically, purposefully inserted biases (and often poorly done at that). You can't build a \"convincing\" or \"charismatic\" AI because persuasion and charm are qualities that human beings (supposedly) comprehend and respond to, not machines. AI \"Charisma\" is just a model built on positive reinforcement. reply tbrownaw 14 hours agorootparent> These are terms taken for granted in common conversation, but when subject to scrutiny, it becomes obvious they lack objective non-circular definitions This is false. A simple dictionary check shows that the definitions are in fact not circular. reply Dracophoenix 2 hours agorootparentIn general, dictionaries are useful in providing a history, and sometimes, an origin of a term's usage. However, they don't provide a comprehensive or absolute meaning. Unlike scientific laws, words aren't discovered, but rather manufactured. Subsequently they are, adopted by a larger public, delimited by experts, and at times recontextualized by an academic/philosophical discipline or something of that nature. Even in the best case, when a term is clearly defined and well-mapped to its referent, popular usage creates a connotation that then supplants the earlier meaning. Dictionaries will sometimes retain older meanings/usages, and in doing so, build a roster of \"dated\", \"rare\", \"antiquated\", or \"alternative\" meanings/usages throughout a term's mimetic lifecycle. reply Unbefleckt 9 hours agorootparentprevI see these terms used in contexts that are beyond the dated dictionary definitions all the time. reply jhanschoo 13 hours agorootparentprevI recently watched a Vox video discussing the AI-powered system that generates operational targets and the negligence in the human supervision that goes into examining that the targets are valid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGqYbXL3kZc I know Vox does not have the credibility of mainstream news, so evaluate its reporting as you will. reply saghm 16 hours agoparentprevThis is all correct, but it doesn't change make it any less of a real issue because adding an AI intermediate step in the biased process only makes things worse. It's already hard enough to to try to prove or disprove bias in a the current system without companies being able \"outsource\" the bias to an AI tool and claim ignorance of it. The reason research like this can still be useful is that of the people who write labor laws (and most of the people who vote for them) aren't necessarily going to \"understand that the results from any data-based modeling process is a concactination of the cumulative input data topologies and nothing else\"; an academic study that makes a specific claim about what results would be expected from using ChatGPT to filter resumes helps people understand without needing domain knowledge. reply aprilthird2021 14 hours agorootparentBingo.

Even if your assertion that \"hiring departments are well known for discriminating\" is true, the ChatGPT bias is independent of that and is coming from casual human behavior on social media, not corporate malevolence. reply Arn_Thor 12 hours agorootparentWe really have no idea what the training data is, or how the black box of training integrated that data.

Our definition of ethical behaviour also changes over time and between social and cultural groups.

One often forgotten law states that you cannot discriminate against veterans. That is a hard thing for an AI to grasp. Phrases like \"served four years in X\" is confusing, so too all the military names/units/ranks. But if your AI is even slightly downvoting veterans... good luck in court. What makes that particular law so dangerous is there is no sliding slope. Either someone is a vet or not: a binary choice. So much of the are they/aren't they testing is dead simple. It will be detected and actioned against very quickly. reply steveBK123 17 hours agorootparentWhat's kind of funny/telling about the current state of AI is that.. if it really worked as incredibly as all the pumps claim, couldn't you simply train it on all the relevant legal codes by jurisdiction?

The US Supreme Court ruling with regards to Colorado leaving Trump off the ballot was a complete farse. Their explanation was conveluted and contradictory, and they decided to include answers to questions that weren't directly part of the case. What is an LLM supposed to do with that, and how can an LLM trained on our laws be expected to make use of that when courts can, and sometimes do, go against the rules as written? reply steveBK123 16 hours agorootparentSo you're saying humans can understand how to follow the law better than AI? reply _heimdall 15 hours agorootparentNo, I'm saying that if you can keep all of our laws in your head at once there are scenarios where you can't follow all of the laws.

Nuance isn't relevant to a client who is trying to avoid ever having to litigate anything. They don't want to be that close to any legal lines. So you wouldn't turn the AI loose on the judge's written decision, rather the boiled-down summaries written by a host of other professionals.

Literally nine words. reply _heimdall 15 hours agorootparentThe one sentence that matters is decided later though, right? The court doesn't write 10 pages and then point to a single sentance to listen to, that's a matter of what the public and/or law enforcement key in on. For future cases the full explanation does still matter too, especially from the Supreme Court. People only remember 9 words from the Miranda decision but the rest of the 10 pages are still case law that can absolutely be used to impact future cases. reply sandworm101 14 hours agorootparentCases yes.

If they are then, an objective system would pick a disabled person, else it should pick a non disabled person, other things being equal or better. As a matter of law and ethics the answer could be different in either case, but objectively, is the system outputting the better answer? Of course laws and ethics may direct us otherwise. Hawking was disabled, but you’d be hard pressed to find a better astrophysicist, for example. reply lolinder 17 hours agoprevThe list of disabilities that the instruction to not be ableist affected and didn't affect is interesting. \"Disability\", \"deaf\" and \"blind\" (in that order) become the first choice >=80% of the time. The instruction moves the needle on \"autism\" and \"cerebral palsy\" but does nothing whatsoever for \"depression\", which GPT-4 evidently doesn't connect with disabilities at all. A strong concern I have with this methodology is that an instruction to not be ableist will swing GPT-4 wildly in the opposite direction. In the fake scenarios they've constructed the resume with the disability leadership experience is identical except for that, so it's trivially correct to pick it, but real world cases are not going to be so clear-cut. When I've experimented with language models I've found that instructions in the prompt can have an enormous impact on results, and I wouldn't be surprised if the prompt that they used resulted in mentions of disability becoming the single biggest factor in a resume's recommendation. The prompt for reference (there's additional content about the manner of speech to use, but this is the part that I think would have the strongest impact on rankings): > As ‘Inclusive Insight,’ your role is to demonstrate a profound understanding of diversity and inclusion, with a special emphasis on disability justice.

A prime example is a cancer detection AI was really just detecting rulers in the photos [1]. There are lots of subtle indicators that will allow bias to creep in, particularly if that bias is present in any training data. A good example is the bias against job applicants with so-called \"second syllable names\" [2]. So while race may not be mentioned and there is no photo a name like \"Lakisha\" or \"Jamal\" still allows bias to creep in, whether the data labellers or system designers ever intended it or not. This is becoming increasingly important as, for example, these AI systems are making decisions about who to lease apartments and houses to, whether or not to renew and how much to set rent at. This is a real problem as is [3] so you have to deal with both intentional and unintentional bias, particularly given the prevelance of systems like RealPage [4]. This is why black box AIs should not be tolerated. Making a decision is one thing. Being able to explain that decision is something else.

Hopefully some cases will go to court, and side with consumers against companies and their black-box AIs, but I'm not hopeful. reply eszed 15 hours agorootparentprevTrue. I think other humans are better able to point out those cases, because they share context - they have, for instance, witnessed other humans following those detrimental traditions - and know, or collectively create, methods to push back against them. We have legal regimes and cultural mechanisms adapted (not perfectly, I'll grant!) to overcoming harmful equilibria. Humans, as a species, and over many many thousands of years, have learned (not infallibly, for sure!) to deal with human foibles and lapses of judgment. We have no similar intuitions for dealing with AI \"reasoning\", and attendant biases. To the extent that AIs are intelligent, they are alien to us. We have no (or very few) valid instincts about them, and they are impervious to our empathy. In fact, empathy - the engine that drives human-to-human cultural progress - is an active detriment in dealing with AI.

Making a decision is one thing. Being able to explain that decision is something else. This is basically not possible with deep-learning. Perhaps an alternative is to require organisations using AI systems like this to define policies around how they make their decisions, and then allow consumers to hold them to their policies. i.e. a policy of not discriminating based on race, and then checking that they don't, and punishing them if they do. They can still use an AI system, perhaps even a racist one if they control for it correctly. Mandating technological details rarely works, is hard to police, and doesn't keep up with technology.

In most cases, a disability will impact your ability perform general tasks (and require additional accommodation). Businesses will want to avoid hiring a disabled, and such laws will just make businesses find roundabout ways of doing so. Of course, this sucks for the disabled, but do such rules actually help? All this does is make hiring disabled an even bigger liability and incentivizes business to avoid hiring disabled even more. reply lannisterstark 11 hours agoparentThis is a really odd take and I am confused by the points you are trying to make. >Of course, this sucks for the disabled You question the obvious benefits -- the fact that business can't just fire/not hire you for say, a work related injury, or getting injured elsewhere, or being disabled in general, and then you provide absolutely 0 recourse except \"Sucks for you bro.\" >a disability will impact your ability perform general tasks (and require additional accommodation). The entire point is _REASONABLE_ accommodation. With reasonable accommodation, most people who suffer from disabilities can do their jobs just fine. Your glasses are _reasonable accommodation_ against you not having 20/20 vision, so is a hearing aid.

    "originBody": "LetterDrop LetterDrop is a secure and efficient newsletter management service powered by Cloudflare Workers, enabling easy creation, distribution, and subscription management of newsletters. The story I have been using TinyLetter to send newsletters to my subscribers, but unfortunately, Mailchimp has now shut down this free service. This isn't the first time I've faced such an issue, whenever this happens, I lose all my subscribers and have to look for a new way to send newsletters. To avoid this recurring problem, I've decided to build my own free newsletter service. It needs to be zero-cost, easy to use, and reliable so it won't get shut down. To achieve this, I'm using Cloudflare Workers to create the service, which I've named LetterDrop. How to use? Create a newsletter Create a newsletter by sending a POST request to the /api/newsletter endpoint like this: curl --request POST \\ --url https://ld.i365.tech/api/newsletter \\ --header 'CF-Access-Client-Id: >' \\ --header 'CF-Access-Client-Secret: >' \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --data '{ \"title\": \"BMPI\", \"description\": \"BMPI weekly newsletter\", \"logo\": \"https://www.bmpi.dev/images/logo.png\" }' Offline the newsletter by sending a PUT request to the /api/newsletter/:id/offline endpoint like this: curl --request PUT \\ --url https://ld.i365.tech/api/newsletter/9080f810-e0f7-43aa-bac8-8d1cb3ceeff4/offline \\ --header 'CF-Access-Client-Id: >' \\ --header 'CF-Access-Client-Secret: >' NOTE: These APIs should be protected by Cloudflare zero-trust security. That means you need to create a service-token and use it to access these APIs. Subscribe or Unsubscribe to a newsletter Just go to the newsletter page and click the subscribe or unsubscribe button. e.g. BMPI. Then you will receive an email to confirm your subscription or unsubscription. After that, you will receive the newsletter when it is published. NOTE: The newsletter page link pattern is https://>/newsletter/:id. Publish a newsletter The LetterDrop use the Cloudflare Email Worker to send emails. And there is a ALLOWED_EMAILS variable to control who can send newsletters. You can use the Cloudflare dashboard to update the variable. After that, you can publish a newsletter by sending your newsletter content to this specific email address. And the Email Worker will send the newsletter to all subscribers. NOTE: You should config the Email Worker to let it can be triggered by the specific email address. Please refer to the Cloudflare Email Worker to know how to do it. The newsletter email subject should be [Newsletter-ID:>]>, e.g. [Newsletter-ID:9080f810-e0f7-43aa-bac8-8d1cb3ceeff4]BMPI Weekly Newsletter - 20240623. How to deploy? To use LetterDrop, you need to create a Cloudflare account and deploy the Worker script. The Worker script is available in the app directory. You can deploy the Worker script using the Cloudflare Workers dashboard. NOTE: You need to change the app/wrangler.toml file to use your config values. The dependencies Cloudflare Workers Cloudflare Email Workers Cloudflare KV Cloudflare R2 Cloudflare Queues Cloudflare D1 Please refer to the app/db/README.md file to create the database. Variables ALLOWED_EMAILS: The list of allowed emails to create newsletters. How to setup the notification service? Currently LetterDrop uses AWS SES to send emails. You need to create an AWS account and configure SES to send emails. After that, you need to create a Cloudflare Worker as a notification service. The code is very simple, you can use the ChatGPT to generate the code. How to handle the failed emails? LetterDrop uses the Cloudflare Queues to handle the failed emails. You can use the Cloudflare dashboard to monitor the failed emails and replay them in the dead-letter queue. What is the next step? The next step is to add more features to LetterDrop. Improvments Add the unit tests. Add the email template. Track the email open rate. Support more third-party email services like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc. Support the mulit-tenant feature. Add the landing page. How to contribute? I used the GPT-4o model to generate the code for LetterDrop. That means the code is generated by the AI model, and I only need to provide the prompts to the model. This approach is very efficient and can save a lot of time. I've also recorded a video to show how to create the LetterDrop project using the GPT-4o model. That also means you can easily customize the code by changing the prompts. You can find the prompts in the CDDR file. Even I use the GPT model to generate the code, I still need to review the code and test it. So if you find any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or pull request. And there is no restriction on the contribution, you can contribute to any part of the project by yourself or with the help of the GPT model. Disscussion If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or pull request. I'm happy to discuss with you. Or you can discuss it in this hacker news thread.",

Adding “make the code secure and efficient” to your prompt doesn’t make it so. I fear for the future quality of software products. Quality was already going down the drain and LLMs have the ability to accelerate the decline. reply 7bit 9 hours agoparentEvery project that says it's \"secure\" is already a complete joke in itself. The multi billion companies who say that about themselves, can't even uphold that statement despite their infinite resources. \"Secure\" isn't a property that anyone can claim, it's a property that only can be attributed looking back in time. reply jorvi 7 hours agorootparentReminds me of a Steve Jobs video where he talks about quality, and how the Japanese never use that as a qualifier in their advertisements. People don’t assume your product is quality because you tell them it is, they experience it or hear so through word of mouth. reply intelVISA 8 hours agorootparentprevSecure and fast (tm) (400mb Python script with supply chain CVEs) Welcome to software postmodernism. reply thih9 4 hours agorootparentBut this works for everyone. Then at some point you have to prevent the users from harming themselves - and devices get locked in walled gardens; and that arguably works for everyone too. There are exceptions, kudos to the EU for working to protect user rights. This software postmodernism will go only as far as we allow it. reply sumsome 7 hours agorootparentprevDoes Microsoft Windows ring a bell? The bloat and insecurity are features, Mr., this is capitalism. Thank you for your service. reply pwillia7 6 hours agoparentprevQuality went down at every step along the abstraction train and look at all we have though. I agree it feels bad but I don't have any examples of abstraction loss of knowledge being a macro negative thing other than maybe Boeing planes right now and I'd argue that's corruption more than abstraction reply rmbyrro 9 hours agoprev> Even I use the GPT model to generate the code, I still need to review the code and test it. This should be the first paragraph in the README. It's not responsible to release something like this in the first place, let alone without a big red warning sign in front of it. reply 8organicbits 7 hours agoparentI'm not a fan of AI slop, but if you're using code from GitHub, the burden has always been on you to make sure it's suitable. The MIT license provides no warranty. There has always been low quality code on GitHub, the bar to publish is low. reply rmbyrro 5 hours agorootparentI agree with everything you said. Being aware of that is why I read everything. One can license without legal warranty and still do it responsibly. If they don't, others will judge as irresponsible. This is more of a social contract than a licensing one. reply Tomte 12 hours agoprevMIT license? If it‘s all ML-generated, then there is no human author and therefore no copyright. It‘s in the public domain, isn‘t it? reply jb1991 10 hours agoparentI would argue the person prompting the LLM and piecing it all together is still a human author. The LLM is just a tool. The average person cannot sit down and create a project with an LLM, so the human is still a key factor. To say there is no human would be similar to saying those who use Copilot are not authoring their code, when clearly there is a curator/director managing what the AI models produce. Auditing and testing and packaging the code, too, is an important part of the process. reply immibis 9 hours agorootparentThe law disagrees. reply jeffhuys 8 hours agorootparentWhich law in which country? reply pwillia7 6 hours agorootparentprevIt would just depend on what the license for the LLM tool (if any) you're using is I think, right? There are no laws about AI generation and copyright yet that I know about. If what you're suggesting is true then does Microsoft word own everyone's novels and are the originator of patents for the last 20 years? Surely government will do a better job than DMCA even though they're more corrupt and captured now /s reply oopsallmagic 10 hours agoparentprevThat depends on your valuation. reply lelandfe 12 hours agoparentprevThe courts will be pleased as punch to hear it is that easy /s reply Tomte 12 hours agorootparentThe courts have repeatedly ruled on this. Well-known case: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_disp... reply mrunkel 11 hours agorootparentThat doesn't say what you think it does. Quoting the judgement: \"only works created by a human can be copyrighted under United States law, which excludes photographs and artwork created by animals or by machines without human intervention\" Clearly, the machine in question is responding to human prompts. The LLM didn't create this program on its own. So I think these are still open issues. reply sumsome 7 hours agorootparent> The LLM didn't create this program on its own. And wouldn't have finished on its own. Sometimes even other models or chats with more fine tuned context just don't spot the mistakes within n iterations. The human needs to, quite annoyed I must say, take a closer look herself. \"What did you LLM do and how does it work?\" Then you specify what must be done or do it yourself because you can't remember the term which would make the LLM find the right symbols, and describing the term takes as long as fixing the issue yourself. This applies more to new kids on the block than to experienced devs, depending on the complexity of the subject, of course, but is relevant for both because the creation, the final product, belongs to the human, as does the LLM. My chat, my LLM, my copyright. If it ever became important, I'd raise an army against their lawyers. reply lupire 7 hours agorootparentWhat is \"your LLM\"? Did you create it? Buy it? reply sumsome 4 hours agorootparentWell, I am paying for it, the subscription and or the API calls. And the chat is the service I and other users, including B2B, paid for. Dev and server costs are covered by that, theoretically and practically, because investors get what they paid for as well. The LLM is instructed by my prompts. I'm giving the directions. At some points, the LLM will dynamically update the weights based on my input, it's knowledge being all that is in the higher public domain, published human knowledge. My communication is being collected to my own, and others, future advantage, which would not be possible if we didn't use the LLM. The devs can't make it much further without the user. The devs couldn't make it anywhere without the training data. 'My LLM' is the current chat window, whatevers' coming out of it, I am responsible for that, not the company who created it, and if I am responsible, I have to own it, just like I own the things 'my child' creates until that child is ready to own it's responsibility itself. reply portaouflop 12 hours agorootparentprevAh so all Legal disputes around AI are completely shut and closed cases? I think it’s rather we have a very small number of reference cases from the past, but since things changed dramatically since then everything is still up in the air reply Tomte 12 hours agorootparentNo, just the question whether machines can hold copyright is decisively shut and closed, until the laws are changed. Many other questions are debated. Always fun to see the „AI is special, no rules apply“ crowd. reply newaccount74 11 hours agorootparent> the question whether machines can hold copyright is decisively shut and closed That's just a small part of the question. Some of the questions we still need answers for are: 1) If ChatGPT produces an answer that is very similar to something it was trained on, can you use that answer? Or do you need a license from the original author? If you do need a license, how do you figure out if an answer is close enough to some original work to require a license? How much effort can we expect a user of an LLM to put into searching for original sources? If you can't identify sources, can you use an LLM at all? 2) Is it even allowed to train an LLM on data without asking for permission? 3) Is prompting an LLM a creative act? Is ChatGPT just a tool like a typewriter? If you type a poem on a typewriter, no sane person would consider the typewriter the copyright holder. So shouldn't we consider the person prompting the LLM the author? reply Tomte 11 hours agorootparentThose questions are all interesting in themselves, but utterly irrelevant here. The first one asks if someone else than the „prompter“ should have copyright. The second one asks about other people‘s copyright. The third one is answered by case law, including the Monkey Selfie case. The wildlife photography setup is very much comparable to your typewriter there. reply FireInsight 11 hours agorootparentIf there's a thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters, and they all write a single page to a thousand-page epic, is the scientist allowed to copyright and sell it as a book? reply lupire 7 hours agorootparentIn the US, absolutely. The scientist set up the conditions and curated the output, and animals have no creative copyright privileges of their own. reply hnfong 11 hours agorootparentprevThe wildlife photography setup had no human intervention when the photo was created since the monkey took the selfie. In this case TinyLetter was \"written\" by GPT4o with a LOT of prompting. Have you even read it? https://github.com/i365dev/LetterDrop/blob/main/docs/CDDR/ap... As always, some random person in a tech forum thinks they have all the answers to non-trivial legal questions... I mean, we haven't even talked about jurisdiction issues yet. US case law does not apply globally. reply lupire 7 hours agorootparentLetterDrop, not TinyLetter! reply lupire 7 hours agorootparentprevYou're losing the plot and contradicting yourself across your comments. What exactly is the thesis you are trying to argue? reply pwillia7 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you think too hard about it it becomes pretty clear AI just breaks the already tenuous justifications for copyright. reply lupire 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is a fascinating comment. Taken alone, it is concise, correct, and well-cited. It does lack a crux, though. But in context, seeing the commenter's previous comment, there is an implied Cruz that is the opposite of the truth, since a reader assumes that any comment is implicitly in support of the commenter's previous comment, and in opposition to the proximate comment it is in reply to, unless otherwise indicated. reply ChicagoDave 11 hours agoparentprevHe said ChatGPT so LLM created. “Fair use” may be the current legal defense, but who knows if or what Congress will do. The lobbying power is definitely in the LLM owners and not copyright holders or creatives. But there’s a non-zero chance LLMs won’t face a class action lawsuit. reply pwillia7 6 hours agorootparentWhat about open source LLM? reply ChicagoDave 4 hours agorootparentCan open source software use copyright material without permission? Any copyright holder that can prove their material is a part of the training data could have the model taken down. But again this will all hinge on the court’s definition of “fair use”. reply nojs 13 hours agoprev> This isn't the first time I've faced such an issue, whenever this happens, I lose all my subscribers That does not strike me as believable - do you really not have the list elsewhere, and does every provider who shuts down not give you the option to get your list out? reply thibaut_barrere 12 hours agoparentIn the case of TinyLetter, this is what happened to me: I didn't receive any email notifications before the shutdown (I verified multiple times). I reached out to Mailchimp and they deleted everything (https://x.com/thibaut_barrere/status/1771931157564727468). Am I responsible for backups ultimately? Absolutely. Will I trust Mailchimp in the future for my own projects? Not very likely. reply fshbbdssbbgdd 12 hours agorootparentWonder if they really don’t have any retention at all. Maybe it would magically become available if they got a letter from a lawyer. reply thibaut_barrere 11 hours agorootparentYes, some form of organisational soft-delete is more than likely. > We're afraid the TinyLetter data is no longer available could perfectly mean: the backups we keep for one year are encrypted in case of legal trouble, but we require a legal action internally before them to be worth reaching out. reply pembrook 11 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like you weren’t sending very frequently, if you logged in anytime over those 5 months there was a banner letting you know it was getting shut down. If it makes you feel better, deliverability people will tell you a list that’s been sitting with no sends for a year or more quickly becomes worthless due to list rot (abandoned emails, expired domains, job switchers, people who forgot you exist and will mark spam/unsub, etc). When you send to an old untouched list, it can tank your domain rep in Gmail since the algo sees tons of bounces/unsubscribes/negative signals. They basically assume you’re a spammer. So it probably would have been a PITA to warm that list again anyways. It’s shitty that gmail incentivizes bulk senders to be annoying and send a lot, but it is what it is. reply pstrateman 12 hours agoparentprevThat actually sounds very likely. I've never had an email delivery company return any communication at all once they have decided you're bad. (0% spam report rate, 0.01% bounce rate) reply nativeit 12 hours agorootparentI think you’re referring to a different event (having an account suspended or banned) than the parent comment, who’s questioning the notion that one wouldn’t have a subscriber list in a CSV or Google Sheet outside of the account, and/or in the event that a service closes up shop, that they would not extend an effort to allow users to export their data. reply pstrateman 12 hours agorootparentIt's a general comment on the professionalism of the bulk email delivery industry, namely there is none. Don't expect them to support a free service they decided to shutdown in anyway. reply dmje 12 hours agorootparentThat's still not answering the question though. I don't know of any bulk email provider who doesn't allow you to export and import your lists via an open format like csv. reply iamacyborg 6 hours agorootparentprev> It's a general comment on the professionalism of the bulk email delivery industry, namely there is none. I strongly disagree. I’ve had the chance to speak with numerous deliverability folks who work at esp’s over the years and they’ve all for the most part been incredibly professional and helpful. reply x11n 10 hours agoprevThe GPT-4o generated project here doesn't even take care of sending the emails - you need to implement a different worker to handle the actual email sending. Of course, this is very easy to create (as per OP), just generate the code: > After that, you need to create a Cloudflare Worker as a notification service. The code is very simple, you can use the ChatGPT to generate the code. reply b800h 10 hours agoparentJesus. Github is just going to get filled up with autogenerated crap, isn't it? reply oopsallmagic 10 hours agorootparentI mean, the crap that was already there wasn't great to begin with. reply dewey 10 hours agoprevFor me https://buttondown.email is the equivalent for TinyLetter before it got acquired by Mailchimp. It's a honest small business and the founder also has an interesting blog: https://buttondown.email/blog reply rc_mob 7 hours agoparentlooks nice, but uhm price is pretty much the same as brevo reply jerrygoyal 5 hours agorootparentlooking at the pricing, brevo is way cheaper reply stavros 13 hours agoprevThe fact that this whole project was generated by GPT without any human duration is... something. I don't know exactly what, but it was interesting enough to upvote. reply eknkc 11 hours agoparentYeah, I took a look at the code and the prompt documentation (which is in Chinese) and I came to the conclusion “why?”. It is interesting though. reply usr1106 11 hours agoprevOf course it will happen again. If the model becomes too popular Cloudflare will restrict free usage of their APIs. And if it is too unpopular they will just stop supporting them one day. reply Labo333 11 hours agoprev@dang maybe the title should reflect the originality of the project, aka the fact it's all AI generated? reply 0898 10 hours agoprevWas TinyLetter the one that Pud from FuckedCompany made? reply hboon 9 hours agoparentYes reply leshokunin 11 hours agoprevI'm working on a self hosted Patreon alternative.

That means the code is generated by the AI model, and I only need to provide the prompts to the model. This approach is very efficient and can save a lot of time. I've also recorded a video to show how to create the LetterDrop project using the GPT-4o model. That also means you can easily customize the code by changing the prompts. You can find the prompts in the CDDR file.\" ??????? reply j16sdiz 13 hours agoparentThis is from the \"How to contribute?\" section in readme. Personally, I found it unbelievable. The author think contribute should change the prompt instead of the code.. To my best knowledge, these kind of code generation are non deterministic. This make it impossible to audit for correctness. reply dvt 13 hours agorootparentI think code generation is, generally speaking, pretty awful, but contributing to an LLM prompt is kind of an interesting evolution of software design. With that said, I don't really think it saves a lot of time (the author's Youtube videos[1] are literally like 10+ hours of messing with prompts and copy-pasting code), whereas the product in itself isn't particularly complicated.

Just look at this mess for internationalization: https://github.com/i365dev/LetterDrop/blob/main/app%2Fsrc%2F... .

The team (I am there to write a code quality report ;) of humans has 0 problems maintaining it. This weird ‘all code must be pristine’ attitude on HN is interesting; I do a lot of these types of code audits and more than 80% of mission critical code I encounter at large companies / institutions is like this or worse and is happily maintained by humans. Take some Spring projects started somewhere in the 2000s with the original team gone: I see 10000s of lines added in jsps files because it was faster/easier to do than actually understanding the structure and properly writing the classes etc. reply braza 11 hours agorootparentprev> And the code is godawful You would be surprised on how big corporations are running on not so elegant code and generating revenue all over. I used to be more principled around code best practices and having things well written, but with the LLMs I just discovered that unless your in a very critical domain where performance or maintenability is a hard requirement, the LLMs with bad code just solve the problem and everyone can be happy. reply latexr 10 hours agorootparentEveryone, that is, except for the customers dealing with buggy slow products that will eventually be breached and leak their data. And the good developers who now have to hunt for dumb bugs without clues for where to look because the person who generated the code can’t help either. reply phantompeace 7 hours agorootparentBut good developers can use LLMs to hunt for the dumb bugs ;) reply croes 11 hours agorootparentprevAre these the same companies we hear about because the got hacked because of security holes in their code? reply braza 10 hours agorootparentIt’s not a direct relationship as far as I know. The point is that maybe the LLMs gave enablement for the people that thinks about software as a “means to an end” and I think it’s completely fine. I like elegant code, well written and easy to maintain; but for a long time the field of programming started to develop the pristine idea that the programming _was the end_ and not as a way to achieve something. What’s the post author made was to bring it in a more latent way saying that you could use programming to achieve the same results but you do not need. reply garylkz 12 hours agorootparentprevAren't that basically all those web framework that we've been using (except that it's worse and less maintainable)? The code generated is very hard to be maintained by human unless you're very knowledgeable and knows what specific things to change (since generally we only interact on framework level unless there's some specific requirements, like how the author proposed to \"modify the prompt\" instead of the generated code) That said, I don't think that the so called \"prompt based\" cough cough engineering is viable at current state, or anytime soon. reply gavmor 12 hours agorootparentAt least using a framework like React would expose these HTML blocks to the typechecker. reply garylkz 9 hours agorootparentHmm, yep you have a point there reply gavmor 12 hours agorootparentprevWow, CSS in a style tag in a string in try block in an anonymous function all declared right there in index.ts—no units, to say nothing of tests!

    "originBody": "This Is The First Animal Ever Found That Doesn't Need Oxygen to Survive NATURE 21 June 2024 ByMICHELLE STARR (Stephen Douglas Atkinson) Some truths about the Universe and our experience in it seem immutable. The sky is up. Gravity sucks. Nothing can travel faster than light. Multicellular life needs oxygen to live. Except we might need to rethink that last one. In 2020, scientists discovered a jellyfish-like parasite that doesn't have a mitochondrial genome – the first multicellular organism ever found with such an absence. That means it doesn't breathe; in fact, it lives its life completely free of oxygen dependency. This discovery doesn't just change our understanding of how life can work here on Earth – it could also have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life. Life started to develop the ability to metabolize oxygen - that is, respirate - sometime over 1.45 billion years ago. A larger archaeon engulfed a smaller bacterium, and somehow the bacterium's new home was beneficial to both parties, and the two stayed together. That symbiotic relationship resulted in the two organisms evolving together, and eventually those bacteria ensconced within became organelles called mitochondria. Every cell in your body except red blood cells has large numbers of mitochondria, and these are essential for the respiration process. They break down oxygen to produce a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, which multicellular organisms use to power cellular processes. We know there are adaptations that allow some organisms to thrive in low-oxygen, or hypoxic, conditions. Some single-celled organisms have evolved mitochondria-related organelles for anaerobic metabolism; but the possibility of exclusively anaerobic multicellular organisms had been the subject of some scientific debate. That was, until a team of researchers led by Dayana Yahalomi of Tel Aviv University in Israel decided to take another look at a common salmon parasite called Henneguya salminicola. (Stephen Douglas Atkinson) It's a cnidarian, belonging to the same phylum as corals, jellyfish, and anemones. Although the cysts it creates in the fish's flesh are unsightly, the parasites are not harmful, and will live with the salmon for its entire life cycle. Tucked away inside its host, the tiny cnidarian can survive quite hypoxic conditions. But exactly how it does so is difficult to know without looking at the creature's DNA – so that's what the researchers did. They used deep sequencing and fluorescence microscopy to conduct a close study of H. salminicola, and found that it had lost its mitochondrial genome. In addition, it also lost the capacity for aerobic respiration, and almost all of the nuclear genes involved in transcribing and replicating mitochondria. Like the single-celled organisms, it had evolved mitochondria-related organelles, but these are unusual too – they have folds in the inner membrane not usually seen. The same sequencing and microscopic methods in a closely related cnidarian fish parasite, Myxobolus squamalis, was used as a control, and clearly showed a mitochondrial genome. These results showed that here, at last, was a multicellular organism that doesn't need oxygen to survive. While H. salminicola is still something of a mystery, the loss is pretty consistent with an overall trend in these creatures – one of genetic simplification. Over many, many years, they basically devolved from a free-living jellyfish ancestor into the much more simple parasite we see today. (Stephen Douglas Atkinson) They've lost most of the original jellyfish genome, but retained – oddly – a complex structure resembling jellyfish stinging cells. They don't use these to sting, but to cling to their hosts: an evolutionary adaptation from the free-living jellyfish's needs to the parasite's. You can see them in the image above – they're the things that look like eyes. The discovery could help fisheries adapt their strategies for dealing with the parasite; although it's harmless to humans, no one wants to buy salmon riddled with tiny weird jellyfish. But it's also a heck of a discovery for helping us to understand how life works. \"Our discovery confirms that adaptation to an anaerobic environment is not unique to single-celled eukaryotes, but has also evolved in a multicellular, parasitic animal,\" the researchers explained in their paper, published in February 2020. \"Hence, H. salminicola provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism.\" The research was published in PNAS. An earlier version of this article was published in February 2020.",

Parasites lose a lot of machinery that they use the host for (such as digestive tracts). Not needing oxygen would mean a pretty dramatic shift in a whole lot of biochemistry.

    "title": "Never* Use Datagrams",
    "originLink": "https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/",
    "originBody": "Never* use Datagrams Click-bait title, but hear me out. TCP vs UDP So you’re reading this blog over the internet. I would wager you do a lot of things over the internet. If you’ve built an application on the internet, you’ve undoubtedly had to decide whether to use TCP or UDP. Maybe you’re trying to make, oh I dunno, a live video protocol or something. There are more choices than just those two but let’s pretend like we’re a networking textbook from the 90s. The common wisdom is: use TCP if you want reliable delivery use UDP if you want unreliable delivery What the fuck does that mean? Who wants unreliability? You don’t want a hard-drive that fails 5% of writes. You don’t want something with random holes in the middle (unless it’s cheese). You don’t want a service that is randomly unavailable because ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Nobody* wants memory corruption or deadzones or artifacts or cosmic rays. Unreliability is a consequence, not a goal. *Unless you’re making some cursed GIF art. Source Properties So what do we actually want? If you go low enough level, you can use electrical impulses to do neat stuff like: Power on LEDs in a desired configuration. Spin magnets at ludicrous speeds. Make objects tingle and shake. etc you get the idea. But we don’t want to deal with electrical impulses. We want higher level functionality. Fortunately, software engineering is all about standing on the shoulders of others. There are layers on top of layers on top of layers of abstraction. Each layer provides properties so you don’t have to reinvent the personal computer every time. Our job as developers is to decide which shoulders we want to stand on. But some shoulders are awful, so we have to be selective. Over-abstraction is bad but so is under-abstraction. What user experience are we trying to build, and how can we leverage the properties of existing layers to achieve that? “Unreliable” There was a recent MoQ interim in Denver. For those unaware, it’s basically a meetup of masochistic super nerds who want to design a live video protocol. We spent hours debating the semantic differences between FETCH and SUBSCRIBE among other riveting topics. I’m the one in the back right corner, the one with the stupid grin on their face. A few times, it was stated that SUBSCRIBE should be unreliable. The room cringed, and I hard cringed enough to write this blog post. What I actually want is timeliness. If the internet can choose between delivering two pieces of data, I want it to deliver the newest one. In the live video scenario, this is the difference between buffering and skipping ahead. If you’re trying to have a conversation with someone on the internet, there can’t be a delay. You don’t want a buffering spinner on top of their face, nor do you want to hear what they said 5 seconds ago. To accomplish timeliness, the live video industry often uses UDP datagrams instead of TCP streams. As does the video game industry apparently. But why? Datagrams A datagram, aka an IP packet, is an envelope of 0s and 1s that gets sent from a source address to a destination address. Each device has a different maximum size allowed, which is super annoying, but 1200 bytes is generally safe. And of course, they can be silently lost or even arrive out of order. But the physical world doesn’t work in discrete packets; it’s yet another layer of abstraction. I’m not a scientist-man, but the data is converted to analog signals and sent through some medium. It all gets serialized and deserialized and buffered and queued and retransmitted and dropped and corrupted and delayed and reordered and duplicated and lost and all sorts of other things. So why does this abstraction exist? Internet of Queues It’s pretty simple actually: something’s got to give. Let the packets hit the FLOOR When there’s too much data sent over the network, the network has to decide what to do. In theory it could drop random bits but oh lord that is a nightmare, as evidenced by over-the-air TV. So instead, a bunch of smart people got together and decided that routers should drop at packet boundaries. But why drop packets again? Why can’t we just queue and deliver them later? Well yeah, that’s what a lot of routers do these days since RAM is cheap. It’s a phenomenon called bufferbloat and my coworkers can attest that it’s my favorite thing to talk about. 🐷 But RAM is a finite resource so the packets will eventually get dropped. Then you finally get the unreliability you wanted all along… Oh no Oh shit, I forgot, I actually want timeliness and bufferbloat is the worst possible scenario. Naively, you would expect the internet to deliver packets immediately, with some random packets getting dropped. However bufferbloat causes all packets to get queued, possibly for seconds, ruling out any hope of timely delivery. How do you avoid this? Basically, the only way to avoid queuing is to detect it, and then send less. The sender uses some feedback from the receiver to determine how long it took a packet to arrive. We can use that signal to infer when routers are queuing packets, and back off to drain any queues. This is called congestion control and it’s a huge, never ending area of research. I briefly summarized it in the Replacing WebRTC post if you want more CONTENT. But all you need to know is that sending packets at unlimited rate is a recipe for disaster. Source: Riveting slides from IETF meetings that you’re missing out on. You, The Application Developer Speaking of a recipe for disaster. Let’s say you made the mistake of using UDP directly because you want them datagrams. You’re bound to mess up, and you won’t even realize why. If you want to build your own transport protocol on top of UDP, you “need” to implement: retransmissions congestion control And if you want a great protocol, you also need: encryption RTT estimates path validation path migration pacing flow control version negotiation extensions prioritization keep-alives multiplexing And if you want an AMAZING protocol, you also need: web support port reuse dynamic MTUs multi-path stateless load balancing anycast load balancing Let’s be honest, you don’t even know what half of those are, nor why they are worth implementing. Just use a QUIC library instead. But if you still insist on UDP, you’re actually in good company with a lot of the video industry. Building a live video protocol on top of UDP is all the rage; for example, WebRTC, SRT, Sye, RIST, etc. With the exception of Google, it’s very easy make a terrible protocol on top of UDP. Look forward to the upcoming Replacing RTMP but please not with SRT blog post! Timeliness But remember, I ultimately want to achieve timeliness. How can we do that with QUIC? Avoid bloating the buffers 🐷. Use a delay-based congestion controller like BBR that will detect queueing and back off. There are better ways of doing this, like how WebRTC uses transport-wide-cc, which I’ll personally make sure gets added to QUIC. Split data into streams. The bytes within each stream are ordered, reliable, and can be any size; it’s nice and convenient. Each stream could be a video frame, or a game update, or a chat message, or a JSON blob, or really any atomic unit. Prioritize the streams. Streams are independent and can arrive in any order. But you can tell the QUIC stack to focus on delivering important streams first. The low priority streams will be starved, and can be closed to avoid wasting bandwidth. That’s it. That’s the secret behind Media over QUIC. Now all that’s left is to bikeshed the details. And guess what? This approach works with higher latency targets too. It turns out that the fire-and-forget nature of datagrams only works when you need real-time latency. For everything else, there’s QUIC streams. You don’t need datagrams. In Defense of Datagrams Never* use Datagrams got you to click, but the direction of QUIC and MoQ seems to tell another story: QUIC has support for datagrams via an extension. WebTransport requires support for datagrams. The latest MoQ version adds support for datagrams. The next MoQ version will require support for datagrams. Like all things designed by committee, there’s going to be some compromise. There are some folks who think datagram support is important. And frankly, it’s trivial to support and allow people to experiment. For example, OPUS has FEC support built-in, which is why MoQ supports the ability to send each audio “frame” as a datagram. But it’s a trap. Designed to lure in developers who don’t know any better. Who wouldn’t give up their precious UDP datagrams otherwise. If you want some more of my hot-takes: The next blog post about FEC in OPUS, and why layers are important. The previous blog post gushed over QUIC, except for the datagram extension which is frankly terrible. Conclusion There is no conclusion. This is a rant. Please don’t design your application on top of datagrams. Old protocols like DNS get a pass, but be like DNS over HTTPS instead. And please, please don’t make yet another video protocol on top of UDP. Get involved with Media over QUIC instead! Join our Discord and tell me how wrong I am. Written by @kixelated.",

The more commonly used term, and IMHO better term, is \"best-effort\" [1]. UDP makes its best effort to deliver the datagrams, but the datagrams may be dropped anyway. But it does not make UDP inherently unreliable. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery reply vitus 7 hours agoparentIMO \"best-effort\" is euphemistic and confusing to people outside of this space, even (especially?) to native English speakers. (I would probably have described UDP as \"reasonable effort\" and TCP as \"best effort\", if not for the existing terminology.) I recall my computer networking professor describing this as \"Best-effort means never having to say you're sorry\". In practice, best-effort does not mean you try your hardest to make sure the message gets from A to B, it means that you made an effort. Router in the path was congested? Link flap leading to blackholing on the order of 50ms before fast reroute kicks in? Oh well, we tried. Meanwhile, TCP's reliable delivery will retry several times and will present an in-order data stream to the application. Reliable vs unreliable might be bad terminology, but I don't think best-effort is any better. My experience with unreliable systems is that they're great something like 95% of the time, and they're great for raw throughput, but there are many cases where that last 5% makes a huge difference. reply eru 6 hours agorootparentThe question is 'who deals with dropped packages'? In TCP, the answer is: 'the protocol'. In UDP the answer is 'the next layer of abstraction' (eg the app or some library). You can build a 'reliable' protocol on top of UDP, and still not get TCP. Eg if you want to transfer a large file that you know up front, then TCP's streaming mechanism doesn't make too much sense. You could use something like UDP to send the whole file from A to B in little chunks once, and at the end B can tell A what (numbered) chunks she's missing. There's no reason to hold off on sending chunk n+1 of the file, just because chunk n hasn't arrived yet. reply vitus 4 hours agorootparent> There's no reason to hold off on sending chunk n+1 of the file, just because chunk n hasn't arrived yet. Congestion control comes to mind -- you don't necessarily know what rate the network supports if you don't have a feedback mechanism to let you know when you're sending too fast. Congestion control is one of those things where sure, you can individually cheat and possibly achieve better performance at everyone else's expense, but if everyone does it, then you'll run into congestive collapse. > You can build a 'reliable' protocol on top of UDP, and still not get TCP. I agree -- there are reliable protocols running on top of UDP (e.g. QUIC, SCTP) that do not behave exactly like TCP. You don't need an in-order stream in the described use case of bulk file transfer. You certainly don't need head-of-line blocking. But there are many details and interactions that you and I wouldn't realize or get right on the first try. I would rather not relearn all of those lessons from the past 50+ years. reply atombender 3 hours agorootparentprevIs there a popular protocol that uses this scheme today? I've often thought that this would be a superior way to transfer/sync data. and have always wondered why it wasn't common. The closest I can think of is the old FSP protocol, which never really saw wide use. The client would request each individual chunk by offset, and if a chunk got lost, it could re-request it. But that's not quite the same thing. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentprevTCP kind of supports that with selective acknowledgements these days, I think. reply vitus 3 hours agorootparentSACKs have been in TCP for 25-30 years now (Widely adopted as part of New Reno, although RFC 2018 proposed the TCP option and implementation back in 1996). That said, the typical reason why TCP doesn't send packet N+1 is because its congestion window is full. There is a related problem known as head-of-line blocking where the application won't receive packet N+1 from the kernel until packet N has been received, as a consequence of TCP delivering that in-order stream of bytes. reply kazinator 7 hours agoparentprevThe term \"best effort delivery\" in networking is a weasel term that is no better than \"unreliable\". It should probably be burned. \"Effort\" generally refers to some sort of persistence in the face of difficulty. Dropping a packet upon encountering a resource problem isn't effort, let alone best effort. The way \"best effort\" is used in networking is quite at odds with the \"best efforts\" legal/business term, which denotes something short of a firm commitment, but not outright flaking off. Separately from the delivery question, the checksums in UDP (and TCP!) also poorly assure integrity when datagrams are delivered. They only somewhat improve on the hardware. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparent> Dropping a packet upon encountering a resource problem isn't effort, let alone best effort The dropping part isn’t the effort; the forwarding part is. > the checksums in UDP (and TCP!) also poorly assure integrity when datagrams are delivered. That’s true, but it’s becoming less of a problem with ubiquitous encryption these days (at least on WAN connections). reply coldtea 6 hours agoparentprevThis sounds like the problem is the term \"best-effort\" (hand wavy, what's the measure of effort? What's \"the best\" effort?). In the end, best-effort is just saying \"unreliable\" in a fussier way. >But it does not make UDP inherently unreliable. Isn't that exactly what it does make it?

UDP does the same, but on the per-datagram level. Reliability is arguably more of a statement about the availability metrics of your underlying network; it doesn’t seem like a great summary for what TCP does. You can’t make an unreliable lower layer reliable with any protocol magic on top; you can just bundle the unreliability differently (e.g. by trading off an unreliability in delivery for an unreliability in timing). reply eptcyka 6 hours agorootparentprevTCP wont always deliver your packets anyway , but it does have a mechanism of timing out if a party believes the other party did not receive something. UDP just means that if one cares for their data to be received, they must verify it themselves. reply eru 6 hours agorootparentYes, it's not so much 'reliable' or 'best effort', rather the difference is 'which part of your software stack should deal with dropped packages'? reply 13415 6 hours agorootparentprevThat's in my opinion what reliable / unrealiable mean in this context. reliable = it either succeeds or you get an error after some time, unreliable = it may or may not succeed I concur with the people who think \"best effort\" is not a good term.

I can't really tell what misconception you are trying to avoid. reply kbolino 5 hours agorootparentI think the issue is that there's a stigma around UDP, largely borne from not using it effectively. I'm not sure this is the right way to address the stigma though. Ultimately, TCP vs UDP per se is rarely the right question to ask. But that is often the only configuration knob available, or at least the only way to get away from TCP-based protocols and their overhead is to switch over to raw UDP as though it were an application protocol unto itself. Such naive use of UDP contributes to the stigma. If you send a piece of data only once, there's a nontrivial chance it won't get to its destination. If you never do any verification that the other side is available, misconfiguration or infrastructure changes can lead to all your packets going to ground and the sender being completely unaware. I've seen this happen many times and of course the only solution (considered or even available in a pinch) is to ditch UDP and use TCP because at least the latter \"works\". You can say \"well it's UDP, what did you expect?\" but unfortunately while that may have been meant to spur some deeper thought, it often just leads to the person who hears it writing off UDP entirely. Robust protocol design takes time and effort regardless of transport protocol chosen, but a lot of developers give it short shrift. Lacking care or deeper understanding, they blame UDP and eschew its use even when somebody comes along who does know how to use it effectively. reply IshKebab 3 hours agorootparentWhat kind of stigma is there around UDP?

NB-IoT with 10 seconds worst case RTT): - TCP will waste roundtrips on handshakes. And then some extra on MTU discovery. - TCP will keep trying to transmit data even if it's no longer useful (same issue as with real-time multimedia). - If you move into a location with worse coverage, your latency increases, but TCP will assume packet loss due to congestion and reduce bandwidth. And in general, loss-based congestion control just doesn't work at this point. - Load balancers and middleboxes (and HTTP servers, but that's another story) may disconnect you randomly because hey, you haven't responded for four seconds, you are probably no longer there anyway, right? - You can't interpret the data you've got until you have all of it - because TCP will split packets with no regards to data structure. Which is twice as sad when all of your data would actually fit in 1200 bytes. reply eru 6 hours agoparentAnd TCP wants to pretend that all your data arrives as a linear stream one after the other; and keeps you from seeing package n+1, if you haven't received package n, yet. That's useful for some things, but often you can make use of package n+1, even when package n hasn't arrived, yet. For example, when you are transferring a large file, you could use erasure encoding to just automatically deal with 5% package loss. (Or you could use a fountain code to deal with variable packet loss, and the sender just keeps sending until the receiver says \"I'm done\" for the whole file, instead of ack-ing individual packages.

It’s never that simple. You can’t just add some erasure coding and have it automatically solve your problems. You now have to build an entire protocol around those packets to determine and track their order. You also need mechanisms to handle the case where packet loss exceeds what you can recover, which involves either restarting the transfer or a retransmission mechanism. The number of little details you have to handle quickly explodes in complexity. Even in the best case scenario, you’d be paying a price to handle erasure coding on one end, the extra bandwidth of the overhead, and then decoding on the receiving end. That’s a lot of complexity, engineering, debugging, and opportunities to introduce bugs, and for what gain? In the file transfer example, what would you actually gain by rolling your own entire transmission protocol with all this overhead? > Fountain codes are how deep space probes send their data back.

On the contrary, for me it’s hard to imagine video game with missed packets as the state can get out of sync too easily, you’ll need eventual consistency via retransmission or some clever data structures (I know least about this domain though) reply smcameron 6 hours agorootparentI'm not expert in this area, but my understanding is that for latency sensitive video games, on the client side, state is predicted between updates, e.g. the state may be updated via the network, at say, roughly 10Hz (probably faster, but probably less than 60Hz), but updated locally at 60Hz via interpolation, dead reckoning and other predictive/smoothing heuristics, a few missed updates just means a bit more prediction is used. \"State\" is not usually transmitted as one lump \"frame\" at a time, but rather per-game unit (per spaceship, asteroid, robot, or whatever is in the game) or per some-small-group of units. When some updates are delayed too long, you might get some visible artifacts, \"rubber-banding\", \"teleportation\" or \"warping\", etc. often lumped together by players under the umbrella term \"lag\". For out-of-order packets, older packets might be dropped as newer packets may already have been applied to the state of some game units (typically there's some timestamps or monotonically increasing counter associated with state updates for each unit used by the prediction/interpolation/smoothing heuristics) and the state is usually represented in absolute terms rather than relative terms (e.g. (x,y) = (100,100), rather than x+=10, y+=10, so that any update may be applied in isolation.) reply CJefferson 6 hours agorootparentprevMany video games just transmit the whole state the player should be able to see every tick.

Let me rephrase the problem here for a simple FPS game: The entire world state (or, the subset that the client is supposed to know about) is provided in each packet sent from the server. The last few actions with timestamps are in each packet sent from the client. You always want to have the latest of each, with lowest possible latency. Both sides send one packet per tick. You do not want retransmission based on the knowledge that a packet was lost (the RTT is way too long for the information that a packet was lost to ever be useful, you just retransmit everything every tick), you do not want congestion control (total bandwidth is negligible, and if there is too much packet loss to maintain what is required, there is no possible solution to maintain sufficient performance and you shouldn't even try), and none of the other features talked about in the post add anything of value, either.

Routers do all kinds of terrible things with TCP, causing high latency, and poor performance. Routers do not do this to nearly the same extent with UDP 2. Operating systems have a tendency to buffer for high lengths of time, resulting in very poor performance due to high latency. TCP is often seriously unusable for deployment on a random clients default setup. Getting caught out by Nagle is a classic mistake, its one of the first things to look for in a project suffering from tcp issues 3. TCP is stream based, which I don't think has ever been what I want. You have to reimplement your own protocol on top of TCP anyway to introduce message frames 4. The model of network failures that TCP works well for is a bit naive, network failures tend to cluster together making the reliability guarantees not that useful a lot of the time. Failures don't tend to be statistically independent, and your connection will drop requiring you to start again anyway 5. TCP's backoff model on packet failures is both incredibly aggressive, and mismatched for a flaky physical layer. Even a tiny % of packet loss can make your performance unusable, to the point where the concept of using TCP is completely unworkable Its also worth noting that people use \"unreliable\" to mean UDP for its promptness guarantees, because reliable = TCP, and unreliable = UDP QUIC and TCP actively don't meet the needs of certain applications - its worth examining a use case that's kind of glossed over in the article: Videogames I think this article misses the point strongly here by ignoring this kind of use case, because in many domains you have a performance and fault model that are simply not well matched by a protocol like TCP or QUIC. None of the features on the protocol list are things that you especially need or even can implement for videogames (you really want to encrypt player positions?). In a game, your update rate might be 1KB/s - absolutely tiny. If more than N packets get dropped - under TCP or UDP (or quic) - because games are a hard realtime system you're screwed, and there's nothing you can do about it no matter what protocol you're using. If you use QUIC, the server will attempt to send the packet again which.... is completely pointless, and now you're stuck waiting for potentially a whole queue of packets to send if your network hiccups for a second, with presumably whatever congestion control QUIC implements, so your game lags even more once your network recovers. Ick! Should we have a separate queue for every packet? Videogame networking protocols are built to tolerate the loss of a certain number of packets within a certain timeframe (eg 1 every 200ms), and this system has to be extremely tightly integrated into the game architecture to maintain your hard realtime guarantees. Adding quic is just overhead, because the reliability that QUIC provides, and the reliability that games need, are not the same kind of reliability Congestion in a videogame with low bandwidths is extremely unlikely. The issue is that network protocols have no way to know if a dropped packet is because of congestion, or because of a flaky underlying connection. Videogames assume a priori that you do not have congestion (otherwise your game is unplayable), so all recoverable networking failures are 1 off transient network failures of less than a handful of packets by definition. When you drop a packet in a videogame, the server may increase its update rate to catch you up via time dilation, rather than in a protocol like TCP/QUIC which will reduce its update rate. A well designed game built on UDP tolerates a slightly flakey connection. If you use TCP or QUIC, you'll run into problems. QUIC isn't terrible, but its not good for this kind of application, and we shouldn't pretend its fine For more information about a good game networking system, see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odSBJ49rzDo, and it goes over pretty in detail why you shouldn't use something like QUIC reply lxgr 3 hours agoparent> 1.

So much time wasted reinventing the wheel. reply p_l 6 hours agoparentThat's because TCP evolved as, essentially, abstraction of serial port. And due to various political & cultural & industrial lobbying, more flexible but complex on their face approaches (OSI) were rejected. TCP meant you could easily attach a serial terminal to a stream, a text protocol meant you could interact or debug a protocol by throwing together a sandwich, an undergrad, and a serial terminal (coffee too if they do a good job). You could also in theory use something like SMTP from a terminal attached over a TIP (which provided dial-in connection into ARPAnet where you told the TIP what host and what port you wanted). If you look through some of the old protocol definitions you'll note that a bunch of them actually refer to simplest mode of TELNET as base.

I can see why people picked streams as the one-size-fits-all-(but-badly) abstraction. reply tliltocatl 5 hours agorootparentBecause worse is better and if you try to be everything you (don't) get OSI. Also because everyone loves serial ports and dialup modems and TCP just emulates a serial port over packet network. And it wasn't supposed to be one-size-fits-all, rather «let us have telnet while we figuring out the rest» but then ossification happend. reply iainmerrick 6 hours agorootparentprevIs it really that unfortunate? What’s the big downside? There’s a bit of reinvention needed, sure, but adding a framing layer is about the easiest task in networking. If you want a standard way of doing it, these days you can use a WebSocket. Edit to add: oh, I see, you want reliable but unordered messages. That would definitely be useful sometimes, but other times you do want ordering. If you don’t need ordering, isn’t that pretty much what QUIC does? reply p_l 6 hours agorootparentSCTP did both reliable/unreliable and ordered/unordered, with QUIC arguably being at least a bit inspired by it, but going over UDP because internet is broken. EDIT: Internet being broken is also why there's a grease extension for QUIC reply taneq 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat would ‘reliable but unordered’ even mean? What’s the difference between a dropped message and one that’s just late? reply saurik 4 hours agorootparentThe difference is whether you get to process the ones which came after first or you must wait for the retransmission of the earlier ones. FWIW, SCTP provides for this difference. reply jzwinck 6 hours agoparentprevHere is a good message framing protocol built on TCP: https://www.nasdaq.com/docs/SoupBinTCP%204.0.pdf If you want large messages just redefine the length from 16 to 32 bits. It's been used for millions of messages per day for 25 years and hasn't been changed in a long time. Admittedly it isn't as common as TCP and that's a shame. But it's out there, it's public, it's minimal and it makes sense. reply eru 6 hours agorootparent> SoupBinTCP guarantees that the client receives each sequenced message generated by the server in the correct order, [...] This protocol guarantees too much.

It has both. reply ajb 6 hours agoparentprevActually, the mistake in IP was in not encrypting the next layer, so that networks can block transport protocol innovation by filtering anything other than TCP and UDP. This is the mistake that quic has fixed. reply Ekaros 6 hours agorootparentI think that one can be forgiven for pure lack of processing power... We forget just how under powered even host machines were and how resource hungry encryption is... reply d-z-m 6 hours agorootparentprevQUIC still runs over UDP. Are you referring to MASQUE? reply ajb 5 hours agorootparentI should perhaps have said \"works round\" rather than fixes - yes, it has to run over UDP but the quic team had an explicit goal of not allowing the network to interfere further : see sec 3.3 and 7.5 of https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3098822.3098842 This now means that innovations based on Quic can occur reply mycall 4 hours agorootparentSince both QUIC and UDP are transport layers, does this mean that once switches and ISPs start supporting QUIC along side UDP and TCP, that a new version of QUIC can be released which doesn't require UDP? reply ajb 36 minutes agorootparentSwitches don't need to change anything to support QUIC, precisely because it uses UDP. So, the deployment of QUIC doesn't involve any technical changes that would enable a version of QUIC that worked directly over IP. It's possible that the defeat of middleboxes would change the motivation of ISPs to filter out alternate protocol numbers, meaning that there might be less resistance to getting them to allow that in the future - but doing so is still a big exercise. Also, the overhead of a UDP packet is 8 bytes total, in 4 16-bit fields: - source port - dest port - length - checksum So, we can save a max of 8 bytes per packet - how many of these can we practically save? The initial connection requires source and dest ports, but also sets up other connection IDs so theoretically you could save them on subsequent packets (but that's pure speculation, with zero due diligence on my part). It would require operational changes and would make any NATs tricky (so practically only for IPv6) Length and checksum maybe you can save - QUIC has multiple frames per UDP datagram so there must be another length field there (anyway, IETF is busily inventing a UDP options format on the basis that the UDP length field is redundant to packet length, so can be used to point at an options trailer). QUIC has integrity protection but it doesn't seem to apply to all packet types - however I guess a checksum could be retained for those that don't only. So in sum maybe you could save up to 8 bytes per packet, but it would still be a lot of work to do so (removing port numbers especially) reply DoneWithAllThat 5 hours agorootparentprevThis was absolutely not feasible at the time IP was being developed. There simply wasn’t enough computational power available or good encryption algorithms invented yet. And you can make a reasonable argument that that’s not the responsibility of that layer of the stack. reply LtWorf 5 hours agorootparentprevEncryption without authentication is rather useless. Just slows things down for no advantage. reply Ekaros 7 hours agoparentprevNow I wonder. Do we have any actual streaming use of TCP, with purely streaming protocol. reply hansvm 3 hours agorootparentThink about what the feature (potentially) buys you: (1) zero-copy, zero-allocation request processing (2) up to a 2x latency reduction by intermingling networking and actual work (3) more cache friendliness (4) better performance characteristics on composition (multiple stages which all have to batch their requests and responses will balloon perceived latency) If you have a simple system (only a few layers of networking), low QPS (under a million), small requests (average under 1KB, max under 1MB), and reasonable latency requirements (no human user can tell a microsecond from a millisecond), just batch everything and be done with it. It's not worth the engineering costs to do anything fancy when a mid-tier laptop can run your service with the dumb implementation. As soon as those features start to matter, streaming starts to make more sense. I normally see it being used for cost reasons in very popular services, when every latency improvement matters for a given application, when you don't have room to buffer the whole request, or to create very complicated networked systems. reply eru 6 hours agorootparentprevYes. When your messages need to be received and processed in the same order they are sent, then a stream is a good (or good enough) abstraction. For most applications some re-orderings of messages don't matter, and others would need special handling. So as a one-size-fits-all-(but-badly) abstraction you can use a stream. > Do we have any actual streaming use of TCP, with purely streaming protocol. But to give you a proper answer: the stream of keyboard inputs from the user to the server in Telnet (or SSH). reply Ekaros 6 hours agorootparentOpens up the question that if you have \"messages\" are you a stream anymore? Can your stream of messages start mid message for example? Surely a stream can have this happen. Or are you instead messages send over a stream. In which case abstraction of stream instead of reliable message transportation is bit weird. Wouldn't each input be a single albeit too short message? But this level of granularity really makes little sense... reply nyc_pizzadev 4 hours agorootparentprevHigh quality VOD (ie streaming a 4K movie). HTTP block file systems, each block needs to be streamed reliably to fulfill the read() call plus read ahead. reply Ekaros 4 hours agorootparentFor VOD can I just open connection and send single message and then stream will continue forever? And HTTP is message oriented protocol. I can't just send infinite length HTTP message. Which would be processed as it arrives or can I? Meaning can I upload something not that small like terabyte of video data over HTTP? reply nyc_pizzadev 15 minutes agorootparentYes for everything. In HTTP1 it’s a chunked response, in H2+ it’s just a bunch of data frames. This is how low latency HLS video works. reply throwaway7ahgb 5 hours agoparentprevCorrect on the reliable UDP. I've seen a few implementations of a reliable UDP messaging stream (using multicast or broadcast). It uses a sequencer to ensure all clients receive the correct message and order. It can be extremely fast and reliable. reply taneq 4 hours agorootparentIf it guarantees delivery and preserves order, what’s the difference vs. TCP? reply colanderman 4 hours agorootparentDelimited messages vs. stream. reply tliltocatl 7 hours agoparentprevYou are looking for SCTP. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentWhich you will absolutely not get past pretty much any middleboxes, unless you encapsulate it in UDP. reply supriyo-biswas 7 hours agoparentprevThere’s Homa[1].

I think by message-based GP is talking not only about message framing (which WebSocket provides) but also reliable out-of-order delivery. reply ori_b 5 hours agorootparentWhen does a long out of order delay look like a packet loss? Is it possible for an out of order packet to get delayed by a millisecond? A second? A minute? An hour? Have you written code to be robust to this? reply paulgb 3 hours agorootparentOther people have probably thought about it more than I have, but the way I see it working is that a set of unacked messages are stored on each end of the connection. When a connection receives a message, it acks it by ID. When acks come out of the order the client sent them in (or after a timeout period), it re-sends the packet that may have dropped. If every message is getting dropped, the set of unacked messages fills up and the connection stops accepting messages from the application, similar to TCP in that situation. I mostly work with TCP so haven't had to deal with unreliable channels generally, but I do use a similar approach at the application level for reliable delivery across reconnects. reply ori_b 52 minutes agorootparentMy point is that a lost message looks the same as an arbitrary delay. reply FpUser 5 hours agoparentprevI have implemented publish/subscribe middleware in the 90s using UDP and reliable IP multicast. It was not too hard to do and had taken me about two month. Yes I did reinvent the wheel but it had numerous positive sides: a) It added yet another area of expertise to my portfolio. b) I did it because it was needed to facilitate another product in the company where I worked. The alternative at the time would be paying $350,000 for middleware from Vendor-X. Not acceptable. c) Vendor-X people noticed us, loved what we did and made us a partner to resell their middleware and we've made a ton of money on deployment, configuring and consulting services. reply karmakaze 5 hours agoprevTL;DR - use QUIC (should have just looked at the domain name) reply FpUser 8 hours agoprevI use UDP for my desktop game like software with clients all over the world to propagate anonymized state.

It needs no reliability since dropped packets would be handled by predictive filter with practical reliability that is way more than needed. So why the F.. would I bother with anything else? reply ralferoo 5 hours agoparentYou might want some form of encryption or message signing to prevent spoofed packet injection. Just because the data might not have value to a third party, knowing that the data is legitimate has value to you. reply FpUser 5 hours agorootparentArguments like this should have practical value for business. For my business the value is zilch. It is simply not worth it for the hacker to mess with my packet server. I've been running it for 10 years with 0 complaints.

It took me whole few minutes to develop. reply ralferoo 5 hours agorootparentMany games are popular targets for griefers or DDOS attacks, not because the attacker gains anything of value from the attack (and many of them aren't actually hackers, they just download the tools written by others), but instead they do it solely for the perverse happiness they get from knowing that they ruined someone else's day / hour / minute.

The reality, of course, is somewhat different and muddy. For example, if you have network outage following later by a software crash or a reboot, then all the TCP buffer worth of data (several kilobytes or upto some megabytes - depends on your tuning) is mercilessly dropped. And your application thinks that just because you used TCP the data must have been reliably delieved. To combat this you have to implement some kind of serializing and acking - but the article scoffs us that we are too dumb to implement anything besides basic stream /s I'm not arguing that TCP is useless, just that UDP has its place and we - mere mortals - can use is too.

The author recognizes that the title is clickbait, but the key point of the article is that you probably don't want to use raw UDP in most cases. Not that UDP is inherently bad (otherwise he wouldn't be working on improving QUIC). reply ben0x539 7 hours agorootparentprevThe author (disclaimer: former coworker) has likely learned about UDP before yesterday because he's been complaining about TCP for years. reply Lerc 7 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is, when you need that low latency, you don't want most of the features of more robust streams. When you are using UDP the correct way to handle out of order delivery is to just ignore the older packet. It's old and consequently out of date. Figuring out how to solve any mess caused by mistransmission necessarily has to be done at the application level because that's where the most up to date data is. reply nabla9 7 hours agoprev [–] The choice is not UDP vs TCP.

    "originLink": "https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/",
    "originBody": "by Brandon Rhodes • Home Start all of your commands with a comma Date: 18 August 2009 Tags: computing Like many Unix users, I long ago created a ~/bin/ directory in my home directory and added it to my PATH so that I could supplement the wonderfully rich set of basic Unix commands with some conveniences and shell scripts of my own devising. The problem, of course, was the chance of collision. Because my shell script names tended to be short and pithy collections of lowercase characters, just like the default system commands, there was no telling when Linux would add a new command that would happen to have the same name as one of mine. This was actually not very likely on, say, a System V Revision 3 workstation in the 1980s, but the trouble became quite a bit more acute when I moved into the world of Debian. Red Hat never really worried me, because they packaged (comparatively) so little software. But Debian today supports a huge number of commands; my modest Ubuntu laptop shows several thousand available: $ apt-file search -x '^/usr/bin/[^/]*$'wc -l 21733 The solution was obviously to adjust my command names in such a way that they were still easy to type, but would never be chosen as system command names. For me, “easy to type” means not having to use the shift key, and very few characters turned out to be available, unshifted, on a modern keyboard. The lower-case letters are the very characters used in system commands; brackets, backslashes, the colon, the back-tick, and the single-tick all had a special meaning to the shell; and the slash and dot characters both mean something special in a filename. (The slash divides directory names from filenames, and thus cannot appear in a filename itself, while the dot means “hide this file from normal browsing” if it leads the name, and separates a file from its extension in many other cases.) There was but one character left: the simple, modest comma. A quick experiment revealed in a flash that the comma was exactly the character that I had been looking for! Every tool and shell that lay in arm's reach treated the comma as a perfectly normal and unobjectionable character in a filename. By simply prefixing each of my custom commands with a comma, they became completely distinct from system commands and thus free from any chance of a collision. And, best of all, thanks to the magic of tab-completion, it became very easy to browse my entire collection of commands. When trying to remember which of my commands are available in my ~/bin/ directory on a given system, or when simply trying to remember what some of my commands are called, I simply type a comma followed by tab and my list of commands appears: $ ,«tab» ,complete-scp ,go-thpgp ,range ,complete-ssh ,gr ,svn-store-password ,coreoff ,hss ,umount ,coreon ,mount-thpgp ,find ,mount-twt I heartily recommend this technique to anyone with their own ~/bin/ directory who wants their command names kept clean, tidy, and completely orthogonal to any commands that the future might bring to your system. The approach has worked for me for something like a decade, so you should find it immensely robust. And, finally, it's just plain fun. ©2021",

I use Windows most of time. Like the author, I have bunch of CLI scripts (in Python mainly) which I put into my ~/bin/ equivalent. After setting python.exe as the default program for `.py` extension, and adding `.py` to `%pathext%`, I can now run my ~/bin/hello.py script at any path by just type `hello`, which I use hundreds of time a day. I now use Linux more and more (still a newbie) but I never get it to work similarly here. Firstly, Linux seems to have no concept of \"associated program\", so you can never \"just\" call .py file, and let the shell to know to use python to execute it. Sure, you can chmod +x to the script, but then you have to add a shebang line directly to the script itself, which I always feel uncomfortable since it's hard-coded (what if in future I don't want to execute my .py script with `/usr/bin/python` but `/usr/bin/nohtyp`?). Furthermore, I failed to find any way to omit `.py` part when calling my script. Again, none of the above is to question the design of the Linux -- I know it comes with lots of advantages. But I really, really just want to run `hello` to call a `hello.py` script that is in my $PATH. reply tomsmeding 0 minutes agoparentThe normal way here is to name your script simply `hello`, start it with a shebang reading `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, and mark it executable. This of course makes running it as `hello` work (if you put it in PATH), but also: - The shebang is only specially interpreted by the Linux loader, i.e. when executing the file directly. - You can still run it with any other interpreter in the standard way: `nohtyp ~/bin/hello`. Python comments start with `#`, so the shebang does nothing with programs expecting Python code. - This situation (a script without an extension) is common on Linux, so Linux-aware editors understand the shebang to indicate a file type. At least, vim understands this and automatically detects a python file type without the .py extension. I get your wish of Windows-like behaviour, and even if you might be able to conspire to have Linux behave the way you want, it's certainly not how people expect it to work, so prefer the above scheme for any software you send to others. :) reply kibwen 8 minutes agoparentprev> then you have to add a shebang line directly to the script itself, which I always feel uncomfortable since it's hard-coded (what if in future I don't want to execute my .py script with `/usr/bin/python` but `/usr/bin/nohtyp`?) > But I really, really just want to run `hello` to call a `hello.py` script that is in my $PATH. On Linux I'd say the shebang is still the right tool for this. If you want a lightweight approach, just have a `my_python` symlink in your path, then your shebang can be `/usr/bin/env my_python` (or heck just `/foo/bar/baz/my_python`, /usr/bin/env is already an abstraction). If you want a more principled approach, look at the `update-alternatives` tool, which provides this sort of abstraction in a more general way: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-set-default-programs-using-up... reply LeoPanthera 13 minutes agoparentprevSimply remove the .py from the filename. It's perfectly acceptable to call it \"hello\". I can't think of a downside to the shebang. If you really wanted to run the script with a different interpreter, just specify it. \"nohtyp hello\" or whatever. If that still bothers you too much, you could define an alias in your shell startup. For example, in bash, you might do: alias hello=\"python3 /path/to/hello.py\" If you were so inspired, you could even write a short script to automatically create such aliases for the contents of a directory you specify. reply djbusby 13 minutes agoparentprevYou can use the /use/bin/env python shebang line to work across python location I keep all my scripts in ~/git/$Project and symlink them into ~/bin and I've added ~/bin to the end of my path. reply jack_pp 10 minutes agoparentprev> what if in future I don't want to execute my .py script with `/usr/bin/python` but `/usr/bin/nohtyp you're thinking too much, people have had that shebang for 20 years without any problems > But I really, really just want to run `hello` to call a `hello.py` script that is in my $PATH.

E.g. in fish type the first char of the command and Tab to launch fzf. Then `,`+Tab is a quick way to filter these custom commands.

One of these names actually collides with a utility that is installed by default on some systems. Doesn’t matter to me. I have my own bin dirs before the system dirs in my path, so mine “win”, and I’m not really interested at all in the tool that mine has a name collision with. If someone were to make a useful to me tool that collided with one of my own tools, I’d probably sooner alias that other tool to a new name that didn’t collide with mine, than to change any of my own tool names.

I prefer using `!bang`s for the same reason for expanding text. reply rahimnathwani 19 minutes agoprevI'm curious how folks manage their important local configurations, e.g. - is your ~/bin directory a git repo? - if you git to manage your dot files, do you use hard links or soft links? reply aslatter 0 minutes agoparentI didn't invent this, but I have a headless \"config\" checkout, and have a git-alias which sets my home-directory as the work-tree: git init --bare $HOME/.config/repo alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.config/repo --work-tree=$HOME' config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no Then I can do things like \"config add\", \"config commit\", and \"config push\". reply codetrotter 4 minutes agoparentprevI have some essential stuff for zsh config in a git repo. For my most important custom bins, they are written in Rust and published to crates.io so I cargo install them from there. It’s just one crate, with wrappers for the git commands that I use day to day In addition to this, I have host specific repos with some scripts. These scripts are not in my path but are instead scripts that run on a schedule from cron. These scripts run and log various facts about the machine such as zpool status and list installed packages, and auto-commit and push those to their repo. And the other kind of script I have invokes zfs send and recv to have automatic backups of data that I care about. In addition to this I have a couple other git repos for stuff that matters to me, which either runs via cron (retrieving data from 3rd parties on a schedule) or manually (processing some data). For neovim I stopped caring about having a custom RC file at all. I just use vanilla neovim now on my servers. On my laptop I use full blown IDEs from JetBrains for doing work. reply lucideer 2 minutes agoparentprevI use chezmoi - it handles both elegantly & has no real requirements w.r.t. how you choose to structure your filesystem. It also handles recovery well when you mess things up. reply nucleardog 10 minutes agoparentprevThere are tools to manage it for you that I’m sure someone will come along and mention, but I’ve got a repo I check out at `~/.home`, then a shell script they just symlinks everything into place. So .bashrc is a symlink to ~/.home/.bashrc, ~/.config/nvim to ~/.home/.config/nvim, etc. It’s simple and only relies on having something sh-compatible available so portable now and in the future. To manage per-system tweaks, I have places that include an additional file based on hostname. For example my .bashrc has something like: if [ -f “$HOME/.bashrc.$HOSTNAME” ]; then source “$HOME/.bashrc.$HOSTNAME” if Which will include a bashrc file specific to that host if it exists. Been working well for me for… a decade now? reply mr_mitm 11 minutes agoparentprevI use ansible reply tedunangst 25 minutes agoprevFunny. My ~/bin is filled with commands that I want to override the system version. reply mozman 19 minutes agoparentWrappers or replacements? If it’s a wrapper do you remove local bin from path or hard code system path? reply sre2 22 minutes agoprevI've been doing this for at least a decade. Was introduced to the idea by a colleague who might have read this blog post. I usually do the same with commands where you are able to create sub-commands too, like git-,home (which allows you to run `git ,home add -p` and it conveniently set GIT_DIR to something and GIT_WORKTREE to $HOME). Sadly you can't do it with git aliases, I have to live with them starting with a dot (via '[alias \"\"]' as a section). reply thanatos519 21 minutes agoprevEncountering this idea 5 years allowed me to bring order to my bag of shell tricks! I have over 50 ,commands between aliases and ~/bin and my shell life is way smoother than the previous agglomeration. reply bityard 29 minutes agoprevGood idea overall, I must say. It's one more key press, but I'm pretty sure I would use underscore for the first character. reply genericacct 26 minutes agoprevbest idea i've read in a while, will do reply kraktoos 27 minutes agoprev [–] Never thought about that, cool! reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

      "Unix users often create a ~/bin/ directory in their home directory to store custom scripts, but this can lead to name collisions with system commands.",
      "To avoid these collisions, the author suggests prefixing custom command names with a comma, which is treated as a normal character in filenames and avoids conflicts.",
      "This technique, combined with tab-completion, allows for easy browsing of custom commands and has proven to be a robust solution for over a decade."
