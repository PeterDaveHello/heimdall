    "originBody": "Will Wilson CEO Is something bugging you? February 13, 2024 It’s pretty weird for a startup to remain in stealth for over five years. People ask me why we did that, and my answer is always the same: “We wanted to build something awesome before releasing it out into the wild, and we were lucky enough to be able to do that under the radar while also attracting great hires, finding early customers, and working with investors.” All the same, it’s an unnatural thing for a startup to do. A lot of muscles end up atrophying, including those you use to talk to the world. Fortunately, we’re going to get a lot of practice at it now, because in those five years we’ve built a lot of stuff – way more than I can tell you about right now. But I can tell you the first part of it. Why We Built This Some of you have heard of our last company, FoundationDB. At first glance, Antithesis couldn’t be more different from FoundationDB, but it’s also a continuation of that story in a funny sort of way. When we sat down in 2010 to build a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed database with ACID transactions, most people didn’t even think it was possible.[1] We were agnostic as to whether it was possible or impossible, but we were certain that even under the best circumstances, it would be very hard. And the part that seemed hardest was how on earth you could test or validate such a thing, and how you could gain confidence in its correctness. The fundamental problem of software testing—you might say the fundamental problem of software development—is that software has to handle many situations that the developer has never thought of or will never anticipate. This limits the value of testing, because if you had the foresight to write a test for a particular case, then you probably had the foresight to make the code handle that case too. This makes conventional testing great for catching regressions, but really terrible at catching all the “unknown unknowns” that life, the universe, and your endlessly creative users will throw at you. This isn’t unique to distributed databases: every kind of software has this problem, but a distributed storage system really turns it up to 11. Now you’ve got concurrency, both within each machine and between machines. You’ve got networks, which always seem to be delaying or reordering packets at the worst possible moments, and disks, which are just waiting for you to look away so they can start vomiting all over your data. And then you’ve got all the stuff that can really go wrong—machine failures and power outages and datacenters catching fire and, oh yeah, well-meaning human beings panicking and accidentally making things worse. What’s especially hard about these failure modes is that they’re non-deterministic—you can easily have a catastrophic bug that’s exquisitely dependent on the precise ordering of events across multiple machines in a cluster. Even if your tests find it once, they may never find it again (but don’t worry, your customers will find it for you). And here we were, trying to make a software system that would behave perfectly and maintain its ACID guarantees in the face of all of this. How were we going to do that? So we did something crazy, which turned out to be the best decision we made in the whole history of the company. Before we even started writing the database, we first wrote a fully-deterministic event-based network simulation that our database could plug into. This system let us simulate an entire cluster of interacting database processes, all within a single-threaded, single-process application, and all driven by the same random number generator. We could run this virtual cluster, inject network faults, kill machines, simulate whatever crazy behavior we wanted, and see how it reacted. Best of all, if one particular simulation run found a bug in our application logic, we could run it over and over again with the same random seed, and the exact same series of events would happen in the exact same order. That meant that even for the weirdest and rarest bugs, we got infinity “tries” at figuring it out, and could add logging, or do whatever else we needed to do to track it down. I gave a talk about this at Strangeloop in 2014, which you can watch here. Anyway, we did this for a while and found all of the bugs in the database. I know, I know, that’s an insane thing to say. It’s kind of true though. In the entire history of the company, I think we only ever had one or two bugs reported by a customer. Ever. Kyle Kingsbury aka “aphyr” didn’t even bother testing it with Jepsen, because he didn’t think he’d find anything. It was a good database. But actually, this is not the cool part of the story. Here is the cool part of the story. The cool part is what happened after we found all the bugs in the database. You see, once you’ve found all the bugs in something, and you have very powerful tests which can find any new ones, programming feels completely different. I’ve only gotten to do this a few times in my career, and it’s hard to convey the feeling in words, but I have to try. It’s like being half of a cyborg, or having a jetpack, or something. You write code, and then you ask the computer if the code is correct, and if not then you try again. Can you imagine having a genie, or an oracle, which just tells you whether you did something wrong? The closest comparison I have is the way some people talk about programming in Haskell or in Rust, where after half an hour of siege warfare against the compiler, it agrees to build something, and you can be confident that it won’t have certain kinds of bugs. But there’s a limit to what a compiler can tell you. I love me a powerful type system, but it’s not the same as actually running your software in thousands and thousands of crazy situations you’d never dreamed of. At FoundationDB, once we hit the point of having ~zero bugs and confidence that any new ones would be found immediately, we entered into this blessed condition and we flew. Programming in this state is like living life surrounded by a force field that protects you from all harm. Suddenly, you feel like you can take risks. We did crazy stuff. We deleted all of our dependencies (including Zookeeper) because they had bugs, and wrote our own Paxos implementation in very little time and it had no bugs. We rewrote the entire transaction processing subsystem of our database to make it faster and more scalable – a bonkers thing to do btw – and the project was shockingly not a debacle, and oh yeah it had no bugs. We had built this sophisticated testing system to make our database more solid, but to our shock that wasn’t the biggest effect it had. The biggest effect was that it gave our tiny engineering team the productivity of a team 50x its size. In 2015, Apple acquired FoundationDB and began using it as the “underpinning of their cloud infrastructure” (that’s a direct quotation from Apple, so they can’t sue me), and then open sourced it a few years later. As our team began to disperse throughout other big tech companies, we were shocked to find that even in these sophisticated organizations, nothing like FoundationDB's deterministic simulation testing existed. The near-impossibility of anticipating unintended system impacts meant that changes to their backend systems happened at a snail's pace, and diagnosing and fixing production bugs consumed months of extremely valuable time from some of their most senior engineers. So I called up my friend and former boss Dave Scherer (FoundationDB’s chief architect), and told him: “There’s a $100 bill lying on the sidewalk here man.” Of course, economic theory will tell you that those don’t exist. There’s always a catch, always some horrible reason that the pot of gold is surrounded by corpses. But starting a company is about banishing that thought and telling yourself that when you reach the pit full of poisonous spikes, you’ll figure something out. So in 2018, we started Antithesis with the goal of bringing the superpower of FoundationDB-style deterministic autonomous testing to everybody else. What We've Built Sure enough, the $100 bill is surrounded by an entire field of poisonous spike-pits, nay, a continent of them. Here’s an obvious one: how do you take an arbitrary piece of software, which is probably doing stuff like spawning threads, checking the time, asking the kernel for random numbers, and talking to other software over a network, and make it deterministic? At FoundationDB we had the benefit of a green-field project that we knew we wanted to test this way, and we had no dependencies (or at least, we didn’t once we’d deleted them all). But any new software development methodology that requires everybody to rewrite everything from scratch isn’t going to get very far. We thought about this and decided to just go all out and write a hypervisor which emulates a deterministic computer. Consequently, we can force anything inside it to be deterministic. That meant learning lots of fun new things about how Intel CPUs handle extended page tables and other related horrors. It’s a story for another time, but it’s a good example of the kind of poisonous spike-pit we’ve gotten to explore (and it’s far from the worst one!).[2] Anyway, we’ve built a platform that takes your software and hunts for bugs in it. When it finds one, that bug is always perfectly reproducible, no matter what crazy thing your software was doing–even if it involves multiple services communicating across a network. Also, once we’ve found a bug, we can bring some relatively space-age and insane debugging capabilities to bear on it. The platform is designed to be able to someday find many kinds of bugs in many kinds of software, but for now, we’re focused solely on distributed systems reliability / fault tolerance testing, because it’s an area where we already know what we’re doing. Over the past several years we’ve partnered with engineering teams at a bunch of organizations with big and complicated systems whose reliability they consider critical. We’ve worked with MongoDB for several years, helping them test their core server software as well as their WiredTiger storage engine. We began working with the Ethereum Foundation about a year ahead of the Merge in order to help them test it, and continue working with them today. And we’re working with Palantir—but when I told them I was writing this blog post they just glared at me and said “no comment”, so that’s all I can say about that. Initially, these customers thought of Antithesis as a “special forces” tool that primarily helped them find and replicate their most elusive and dangerous bugs. But as our platform has become more mature and interactive, we’ve shifted to being an “always on” service that continuously tests the most recent builds of their software, thus shortening the time from bug introduction to bug discovery. When building FoundationDB, we found that this made diagnosing and fixing bugs dramatically easier, increasing our efficiency and improving our software quality. Our customers are seeing this effect now, and we’re excited to help many more of you reach the ~zero bugs promised land in the years to come. Get In Touch? If your organization runs a distributed system and values reliability and engineering productivity, we’d love to talk. Do you occasionally walk into a spike pit and say to yourself: “Not bad, but these spikes really aren’t poisonous enough”? If so, please take a look at our open positions. If you’ve got questions or comments, feel free to reach out on TwitterX or contact@antithesis.com (we’ll actually reply). If you’ve made it this long – thank you for reading. More to come soon. 1. Back then Spanner wasn’t public yet and a lot of people misinterpreted the CAP theorem to say that a strongly consistent database couldn’t also be highly available in the face of network faults.↩ 2. As Dave never ceases to remind me, the problem of exploring the state space for an arbitrary program, looking for violations of a property that could involve multiple rounds of universal and existential quantification, is actually worse than the Turing Halting Problem. There are test properties that would still be uncomputable even if you had a halting oracle for every program.↩",

I feel like the idea of the legendary \"10x\" developer has been bastardized to just mean workers who work 15 hours a day 6.5 days a week to get something out the door until they burn out. But here's your real 10x (or 50x) productivity. People who implement something very few people even considered or understood to be possible, which then gives amazing leverage to deliver working software in a fraction of the time. reply didgetmaster 17 hours agoparentIt seems like the industry would get a lot more 10x behavior if it was recognized and rewarded more often than it currently does. Too often, management will focus more on the guy who works 12 hour days to accomplish 8 hours of real work than the guy who gets the same thing accomplished in an 8 hour day. Also, deviations from 'normal' are frowned upon. Taking time to improve the process isn't built into the schedule; so taking time to build a wheelbarrow is discouraged when they think you could be hauling buckets faster instead. reply sangnoir 14 hours agorootparent>It seems like the industry would get a lot more 10x behavior if it was recognized and rewarded more often than it currently does I'd be happier if industry cares more for team productivity - I have witnessed how rewarding \"10x\" individuals may lead to perverse results on a wider scale, a la Cobra Effect. In one insidious case, our management-enabled, long-tenured \"10x\" rockstar fixed all the big customer-facing bugs quickly, but would create multiple smaller bugs and regressions for the 1x developers to fix while he moved to the next big problem worthy of his attention. Everyone else ended up being 0.7x - which made the curse of an engineer look even more productive comparatively! Because he was allowed to break the rules, there was a growing portion of the codebase that only he could work on - while it wasn't Rust, imagine an org has a \"No Unsafe Rust\" rule that is optional to 1 guy. Organizations ought to be very careful how they measure productivity, and should certainly look beyond first-order metrics. reply JohnMakin 9 hours agorootparent> In one insidious case, our management-enabled, long-tenured \"10x\" rockstar fixed all the big customer-facing bugs quickly, but would create multiple smaller bugs and regressions for the 1x developers to fix while he moved to the next big problem worthy of his attention.

Worked on a team like this with a “principal” engineer who’d work very fast with bug-ridden work like this simply because he had the automatic blessing from on high to do whatever he wanted. My unfortunate task was to run along behind him and clean up, which to my credit I think I did a pretty good job at, but of course these types can only very rarely acknowledge/appreciate that. Eventually he got super insecure/threatened and attempted to push me out along with whoever else he felt was a threat to his fiefdom. reply chris_wot 5 hours agorootparentWhat happened to him in the end? reply lifeisstillgood 11 hours agorootparentprevI try to look at these things through the lens of “software literacy” - software is a form of literacy and this story might be better viewed as “a bunch of illiterate managers are impressed with one good writer at the encyclopdia publishers, now it turns out this guy makes mistakes, but hey, what do you expect when the management cannot read or write !” reply SomeCallMeTim 14 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of the \"Parable of the Two Programmers.\" [1] A story about what happens to a brilliant developer given an identical task to a mediocre developer.

In the early computing era there was a competition. Something like take some input and produce an output. One programmer made a large program in (IIRC) Fortran with complex specifications documentation etc. The other used shell pipes, sort, and a small handful or two of other programs in a pipeline to accomplish the same task in like 10 developer min. reply ramses0 12 hours agorootparentThe Knuth link in the sibling comment is an original, but you're probably thinking of \"The Tao of Programming\" http://catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/ten-thousand.html \"\"\"“And who better understands the Unix-nature?” Master Foo asked. “Is it he who writes the ten thousand lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by not coding?”\"\"\" reply ianmcgowan 13 hours agorootparentprevSounds like \"Knuth vs McIlroy\", which has been discussed on hn and elsewhere before, and the general take is that it was somewhat unfair to Knuth.

For more, please follow the links from some of the previous HN discussions, e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31301777. [For those who may not follow all the links: Bentley asked Knuth to write a program in Pascal (WEB) to illustrate literate programming—i.e. explaining a long complicated program—and so Knuth wrote a beautiful program with a custom data structure (hash-packed tries). Bentley then asked McIlroy to review the program. In the second half of the review, McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipes) questioned the problem itself (the idea of writing a program for scratch), and used the opportunity to evangelize Unix and Unix pipes (at the time not widely known or available).] reply rzzzt 10 hours agorootparentprevThere was also the \"Hadoop vs. unix pipeline running on a laptop\"-story a few years back, a more modern take: https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-... reply ramses0 10 hours agorootparentBash-Reduce: https://github.com/sorhus/bash-reduce reply SomeCallMeTim 11 hours agorootparentprevI was both of those developers at different times, at least metaphorically. I drank from the OO koolaid at one point. I was really into building things up using OOD and creating extensible, flexible code to accomplish everything. And when I showed some code I'd written to my brother, he (rightly) scoffed and said that should have been 2-3 lines of shell script. And I was enlightened. ;) Like, I seriously rebuilt my programming philosophy practically from the ground up after that one comment. It's cool having a really smart brother, even if he's younger than me. :) reply 6510 12 hours agorootparentprevI had an idea once but when I tried to explain it people didn't understand. I revisited earlier thought: communication is a 2 man job, one is to not make an effort to understand while the other explains things poorly. It always manages to never work out. Periodically I thought about the puzzle and was eventually able to explain it such that people thought it was brilliant ~ tho much to complex to execute. I thought about it some more, years went by and I eventually managed to make it easy to understand. The response: \"If it was that simple someone else would have thought of it.\" I still find it hilarious decades later. It pops to mind often when I rewrite some code and it goes from almost unreadable to something simple and elegant. Ah, this must be how someone else would have done it! reply drekipus 11 hours agorootparent> Ah, this must be how someone else would have done it! This is a good exclamation :D And it's a poignant story. Thanks for sharing. reply lifeisstillgood 11 hours agorootparentprevThat’s pretty good. It needs an Athena poster :-) reply HenryBemis 11 hours agorootparentprev“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” ― Abraham Lincoln I have started to follow this 'lately' (for a decade) and it has worked miracles. As for the anxious managers/clients, I keep them updated of the design/documentation/though process, mentioning the risks of the path-not-taken, and that maintain their peace of mind. But this depends heavily on the client and the managers. reply _a_a_a_ 12 hours agorootparentprevWithout more backup I can only describe that as being fiction. Righteous fiction, where the good guy gets downtrodden and the bad guy wins to fuel the reader's resentment. reply SomeCallMeTim 11 hours agorootparentIt's practically my life experience. Sometimes I'm appreciated, and managers actually realize what they have when I create something for them. Frequently I accomplish borderline miracles and a manager will look at me and say, \"OK, what about this other thing?\" My first job out of college, I was working for a company run by a guy who said to me, \"Programmers are a dime a dozen.\" He also said to me, after I quit, after his client refused to give him any more work unless he guaranteed that I was the lead developer on it, \"I can't believe you quit.\" I simply shrugged and thought, \"Maybe you shouldn't have treated me like crap, including not even matching the other offer I got.\" I've also made quite a lot of money \"Rescuing Small Companies From Code Disasters. (TM)\" ;) Yes, that's my catch phrase. So I've seen the messes that teams often create. The \"incompetent\" team code description in the story is practically prescient. I've seen the results of exactly that kind of management and team a dozen times. Things that, given the same project description, I could have created in 1/100 the code and with much more overall flexibility. I've literally thrown out entire projects like that and replaced them with the much smaller, tighter, and faster code that does more than the original project. So all I can say is: Find better teams to work with if you think this is fiction. This resonates with me because it contains industry Truth. reply 6510 11 hours agorootparentprevTo me it is a story about managers clueless about the work. You can make all the effort in the world to imagine doing something but the taste of the soup is in the eating. I do very simple physical grunt work for a living, there it is much more obvious that it is impossible. It's truly hilarious. They probably deserve more praise when they do guess correctly but would anyone really know when it happens? reply happytiger 16 hours agorootparentprevThat’s because most executives can’t understand technology deeply enough to know the difference. reply didgetmaster 15 hours agorootparentEven when they are smart enough to know, they seem to have very short memories. While I don't consider myself to be a 10x engineer; I have certainly done a number of 10x things over my career. I worked for a company where I almost single handedly built a product that resulted in tens of millions of dollars in sales. I got a nice 'atta boy' for it, but my future ideas were often overridden by someone in management who 'knew better'. After the management changed, I found myself in a downsizing event once I started criticizing them for a lack of innovation. reply KuriousCat 15 hours agorootparentThis is the sad part of it, many people without core competence end up in \"leadership\" positions and remove any \"perceived\" threats to their authority. I believe part of it is due to the absence of leadership training in the engineering curriculum. Colleges should encourage engineers to take up few leadership courses and get them trained on things like Influence and Power. reply umvi 8 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of the inventer of the blue LED (see recent veritasium video) reply Terretta 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's almost impossible to get executives to think in return on equity (“RoE”) for the future instead of “costs” measured in dollars and cents last quarter. Which is weird, since so many executives are working in a VC-funded environment, and internal work should be “venture funded” as well. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 11 hours agorootparentprev> It seems like the industry would get a lot more 10x behavior if it was recognized and rewarded more often than it currently does. I don't agree with that, there are a _lot_ of completely crap developers and they get put into positions where even the ones capable of doing so aren't allowed to because it's not on a ticket. I've seen some thing. reply ransom1538 14 hours agorootparentprevHonestly? You work at a place a manager hasn't heard \"impact\" yet? I thought managers at this point just walk around the office saying \"impact\". reply TrackerFF 23 minutes agoparentprevWas it 50x productivity due to 10x engineers, or 50x productivity due to optimized company structure? (edit: obviously, these do not need to be mutually exclusive - it's a sum of all the different parts) It's easy to bog down even the best Nx engineers if you keep them occupied with endless bullshit tasks, meetings, (ever) changing timelines, and all that. Kind of like having a professional driver drive a sportscar through a racetrack, versus the streets of Boston. reply mettamage 16 hours agoparentprevWhen I was in college, I've met a few people that coded _a lot_ faster than me. Typically, they started since they were 12 instead of 21 (like me). That's how 10x engineers exist, by the time they are 30, they have roughly 20 years of programming experience behind their belt instead of 10. Also, their professional experience is much greater. Sure, their initial jobs at 15 are the occassional weird gig for the uncle/aunt or cousin/nephew but they get picked up by professional firms at 18 and do a job next to their CS studies. At least, that's how it used to be. Not sure if this is still happening due to the new job environment, but this was the reality from around 2004 to 2018. For 10x engineers to exist, all it takes is a few examples. To me, everyone is in agreement that they seem to be rare. I point to a public 10x engineer. He'd never say it himself, but my guess is that this person is a 10x engineer [1]. If you disagree, I'm curious how you'd disagree. I'm just a blind man touching a part of the elephant [2]. I do not claim to see the whole picture. [1] https://bellard.org/ (the person who created JSLinux) [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant - if you don't know the parable, it's a fun one! reply QuercusMax 15 hours agorootparentYup, that's been my experience as someone who asked for a C++ compiler for my 12th birthday, worked on a bunch of random websites and webapps for friends of the family, and spent some time at age 16-17 running a Beowulf cluster and attempting to help postdocs port their code to run on MPI (with mixed success). All thru my CS education I was writing tons of toy programs, contributing (as much as I could) toward OSS, reading lots of stuff on best practices, and leaning on my much older (12 years) brother who was working in the industry. He pointed me to Java and IntelliJ, told me to read Design Patterns (Gang of Four) and Refactoring (Fowler). I read Joel on Software religiously, even though he was a Microsoft guy and I was a hardcore Linux-head. By the time I joined my first real company at age 21, I was ready to start putting a lot of this stuff into place. I joined a small med device software company which had a great product but really no strong software engineering culture: zero unit tests, using CVS with no branches, release builds were done manually on the COO's workstation, etc. As literally the most junior person in the company I worked through all these things and convinced my much more senior colleagues that we should start using release branches instead of \"hey everybody, please don't check in any new code until we get this release out the door\". I wrote automated build scripts mostly for my own benefit, until the COO realized that he didn't have to worry about keeping a dev environment on his machine, now that he didn't code any more. I wrote a junit-inspired unit testing framework for the language we were using (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language) - like Matlab but weirder). Without my work as a \"10x junior engineer\", the company would have been unable to scale to more than 3 or 4 developers. I got involved in hiring and made sure we were hiring people who were on board with writing tests. We finally turned into a \"real\" software company 2 or 3 years after I joined. reply mettamage 15 hours agorootparentThis sounds similar to the best programmer I personally know and he was an intern working at LLVM at the time. It's funny how companies treat that part of his life as \"no experience\". Then suddenly he goes into the HFT space and within a couple of years he has a similar rank that people have that are twice his age. 10x engineers exist. To be fair, it does depend which software engineer you see as \"the standard software engineer\", but if I take myself as a standard (as an employed software engineer with 5 years of experience), then 10x software engineers exist. reply eschneider 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm not even sure that coding _much_ faster than necessary is even required to give a 3-5x multiple on \"average\", let alone \"worst case\" developers. Some of the biggest productivity wins can be had by being able to look at requirements, knowing what's right or wrong about them, and getting everyone on the same page so the thing only needs to be made once. Being good at test and debug so problems are identified and fixed _early_ are also big wins. Lots of that is just having the experience to recognize what sort of problem you're dealing with very quickly. Being a programming prodigy is nice, but I don't think you even really need that. reply lolinder 10 hours agorootparentAll of the things you list are the product of the experience that OP is talking about. Anyone can get there with 20 years of (sufficiently rigorous) experience by ~40, but people who start as a child have a head start and it does show. It's probably especially obvious in the child-prodigy types because we as an industry have a tendency to force people out of IC roles by 40, so the child prodigies are the only ones who have enough time to develop 20 years of experience working directly with code. reply morgante 1 hour agorootparentIt's not just that people get pushed out of IC work, but everyone tends to have less energy as they get older + other life demands accumulate. The combination of 10-15 years of experience and the energy/time of 20s is very powerful. reply gryn 8 hours agorootparentprevthe other factor I noticed from the days I was programming for fun vs these days where I'm programming for pay. in those early years the tasks that you take on are probably above your skillset and fight through it, you're not accountable to anyone. in a job you're usually hired for what you already know, +/- some margin for more gradual learning , not really that much room for moonshots. the work need to be divided into bit sized parts that you can justify to the higher-ups when needed. you have less room for exploring really non linear paths toward the solution which can be harder to explain but where you learn more. so in the end this end up sometimes amounting to 10years of experience outside work being more impactful than 10 years at work. , reply joantune 11 hours agorootparentprevUnderrated comment reply theamk 14 hours agorootparentprevLast year, we had 2 new hires.. one is fresh out of college (and not one of the top ones), other with 15 years experience on resume in our industry. I am not sure there is 10x difference, but there is at least 5x difference in performance, in favor of fresh college grad, and they are now working on the more complex tasks too. The sad part is our hiring is still heavily in \"senior engineer with lots of experience\" phase, and intership program has been canceled. reply whstl 10 hours agorootparentI also had a lot of luck with interns. At my previous company I had 2 first-job juniors and 4 or 5 interns that were outstanding. (however the last one was totally terrible and totally killed my hiring credibility hah, but it was a 80% success rate still) I find that there are too many pretenders, though. I get way too many people with 15 years of experience and ChatGPT resumes that just can't code at all :/ reply mianos 7 hours agorootparenthave hired five interns and five experienced developers. Some of the interns exceeded expectations, while some of the experienced developers also performed well. The top-performing experienced developers outshone all the graduates. However, the less effective experienced developers were on par with the graduates, showing no significant difference in performance. The takeaway for me is that simple anecdotes are not very informative. Over time and with a larger sample size, experienced individuals tend to perform better. Nonetheless, some graduates will also become exceptionally skilled. Graduates are more cost-effective. Experienced professionals require less oversight. If they need substantial guidance, they don't truly qualify as senior, as opposed to their resume that says, at 25 they have been a CTO for 10 years). reply whstl 24 minutes agorootparentI’m not complaining about the quality of seniors I hire or comparing them to interns. reply confidantlake 12 hours agorootparentprevI am not convinced that just starting early is all there is to it.

Talent is a real thing. reply joantune 11 hours agorootparentThe intensity you did it though matters. You probably didn't spend that many years on a specific sport for instance. And when we're talking about sports, genetics matter as well (depending on each one) When we're talking brains, while genetics also matter, assuming normal (whatever that is) brain, the plasticity changes a lot how it operates. So, the 10 years thing is definitely a big if not the biggest part. In my opinion. Would love to see studies if any exist out there on this reply confidantlake 10 hours agorootparentI did spend years on a specific sport starting as a kid. I was average. There were people that first played the sport as teenagers and within a year were competitive nationally. I was in the same math classes as some of my peers for a decade+. Some people were great, some were bad and most were somewhere in between. The kids who were exceptional at 9 were exceptional at 17. Obviously time matters but genetics play a huge role as well. I have a family friend with 2 adopted kids and 2 biological kids. The adopted ones are average but the biological ones are very smart. Just like their parents. reply jasonfarnon 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's possible there are plenty of individuals 10x better than you while you are 10x better than most, due to early exposure.

I became friends with Dave our CTO when I was 5 or 6, we were neighbors. He'd already started coding little games in Basic (this was 1985). Later in our friendship, like when I was maybe 10, I asked him if he could help me learn to code, which he did. After a week or two I had made some progress but compared what I could do to what he was doing and figured \"I guess I just started too late, what's the point?\". I found out later that most people didn't start coding till late HS or college! It worked out though - I'm programmer adjacent and have taken care of the business side of our projects through the years :) reply SomeCallMeTim 14 hours agorootparentprevYes: Programmers who start at twelve are often the 10x programmers who can really program faster than the average developer by a lot. No: It's not because they have 10 more years of experience. Read \"The Mythical Man Month.\" That's the book that popularized the concept that some developers were 5-25x faster than others. One of the takeaways was that the speed of a developer was not correlated with experience. At all. That said, the kind of person who can learn programming at 12 might just be the kind of person who is really good at programming. I started learning programming concepts at 11-12. I'm not the best programmer I know, but when I started out in the industry at 22 I was working with developers with 10+ years of (real) experience on me...and I was able to come in and improve on their code to an extreme degree. I was completing my projects faster than other senior developers. With less than two years of experience in the industry I was promoted to \"senior\" developer and put on a project as lead (and sole) developer and my project was the only one to be completed on time, and with no defects. (This is video game industry, so it wasn't exactly a super-simple project; at the time this meant games written 100% in assembly language with all kinds of memory and performance constraints, and a single bug meant Nintendo would reject the image and make you fix the problem. We got our cartridge approved the first time through.) Some programmers are just faster and more intuitive with programming than others. This shouldn't be a surprise. Some writers are better and faster than others. Some artists are better and faster than others. Some architects are better and faster than others. Some product designers are better and faster than others. It's not all about the number of hours of practice in any of these cases; yes, the best in a field often practices an insane amount. But the very top in each field, despite having similar numbers of hours of practice and experience, can vary in skill by an insane amount. Even some of the best in each field are vastly different in speed: You can have an artist who takes years to paint a single painting, and another who does several per week, but of similar ultimate quality. Humans have different aptitudes. This shouldn't even be controversial. I do wonder if the \"learned programming at 12\" has anything to do with it: Most people will only ever be able to speak a language as fluently as a native speaker if they learn it before they're about 13-14 years old. After that the brain (again, for most people; this isn't universal) apparently becomes less flexible. In MRI studies they can actually detect differences between the parts of the brain used to learn a foreign language as an adult vs. as a tween or early teen. So there's a chance that early exposure to the right concepts actually reshapes the brain. But that's just conjecture mixed with my intuition of the situation: When I observe \"normal\" developers program, it really feels like I'm a native speaker and they're trying to convert between an alien way of thinking about a problem into a foreign language they're not that familiar with. AND...there may not be a need to explicitly PROGRAM before you're 15 to be good at it as an adult. There are video games that exercise similar brain regions that could substitute for actual programming experience. AND I may be 100% wrong. Would be good for someone to fund some studies. reply koreth1 8 hours agorootparentThat childhood native-fluency analogy is insightful! Your experience matches mine. I started programming at age 7 and it's true that the way code forms in my head feels similar to the way words form when I'm writing or speaking in English. In the same way that I don't stop and consciously figure out whether to use the past or present tense while I'm talking, I usually don't consciously think about, say, what kind of looping construct I'm about to use; it's just the natural-feeling way to express the idea I'm trying to convey. The idea itself is kind of already in the form of mental code in the same way that my thoughts are kind of already in English if I'm speaking. But... maybe that's how it is for everyone, even people who learned later? I only know how it is in my own head. reply whstl 10 hours agorootparentprevThe association with video games in your last paragraph makes a lot of sense to me. This is how I feel solving problems. I always thought that people who start at 12 and keep at it are good because they really love it.I see people who struggle a lot with learning, and it's because they hate it but are doing it for other reasons. reply giantg2 17 hours agoparentprevI'm tired of hearing about 10x engineers.

Productivity has no inherent value - like efficiency and perfection, it is necessarily of something else. Its value is entirely derived. reply JimDabell 16 hours agorootparentprevThe “10x engineer” comes from the observation that there is a 10x difference in productivity between the best and the worst engineers. By saying that you want to be a 1x engineer, you’re saying you want to be the least productive engineer possible. 1x is not the average, 1x is the worst. reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparentI'm not sure your math works. What we do know is that the worst engineers provide negative productivity. If 1x is the worst engineer, then let's for the sake of discussion denote x as -1 in order for the product to be negative. Except that means the 10x engineer provides -10 productivity, actually making them the worst engineer. Therein lies a conflict. What we also know is that best engineer has positive productivity, so that means the multiplicand must always be positive. Which means that it is the multiplier that must go negative, meaning that a -1x and maybe even a -10x engineer exists. reply moritzwarhier 15 hours agorootparentThank you. This sounds so trivial at first, but your reductio ad absurdum at the beginning of your comment really nails it. Throw into the mix the fact that productivity is hard to measure as soon as more than one person works on something and that doesn't even begin to consider the economical aspects of software. And even when ignoring this point, there's that pesky short-term vs long-term thing. Also, how do you define the term \"productivity\"? I was assuming that you mean somethint along the lines of (indirect, if employed) monetary output. reply JimDabell 16 hours agorootparentprevYou are arguing against the idea that there is a factor of ten difference in productivity between the best and the worst engineers. That’s fine if you want to do that, but that’s explicitly where the term “10x engineer” comes from and what defines its meaning. So if you disagree with the underlying concept, there is no way for you to use terms like “[n]x engineer” coherently since you disagree with its most fundamental premise. You certainly shouldn’t reinvent different meanings for these terms. reply margalabargala 15 hours agorootparentprevYou're not wrong, but I think you may be treating something as literal math, when it is in fact idiomatic labels used to express trends. reply randomdata 15 hours agorootparentThe problem here is the introduction of productivity. The 10x developer originated from a study that measured performance. The 10x developer being able to do a task in a 10th of the time is quite conceivable and reflects what the study found. I'm sure we've all seen a developer take 10 hours to do a job that would take another developer just 1 hour. Nobody is doing it in negative hours, so the math works. But performance is not the same as productivity. reply esafak 9 hours agorootparentMeasuring productivity like that in technology makes no sense because our work is not fungible; what and how we do it matters as much as how fast we do it. Time-based productivity measurement is for factory workers stamping out widgets. So in our revenue-based world, negative productivity makes sense. reply randomdata 7 hours agorootparent> productivity Performance. That is what the study that found a 10x performance difference observed. There is no mention of productivity in the study. If anyone has tried to study productivity, they most certainly have not come up with a 10x moniker. It seems productivity was mentioned in this thread only because it also happens to start with the letter 'p' and someone got confused. reply loeg 9 hours agorootparentprevEngineers with negative productivity are vanishingly rare, soon to be terminated, and reasonable to exclude for the purpose of the comparison. reply randomdata 6 hours agorootparentOkay, but it still doesn't work. The world's worst engineer who somehow managed to successfully contribute one line of code to something like GPT is way more productive than a great engineer who designed from top to bottom the best laid software ever conceived but was thrown away before seeing the light of day because the business changed direction. Of course, that doesn't actually matter as the original study found a 10x difference in measuring performance, not productivity. There is nothing out there to suggest that some developers are 10x more productive outside of those who mixed up their p words. We're not actually talking about productivity; that was just a mistake. If one were to study productivity, I expect they would find that some engineers are many orders of magnitude more productive than the least productive engineers. reply loeg 6 hours agorootparent> The world's worst engineer who somehow managed to successfully contribute one line of code to something like GPT is way more productive than a great engineer who designed from top to bottom the best laid software ever conceived but was thrown away before seeing the light of day because the business changed direction. I reject that assertion. > performance, not productivity You keep saying this like it's a slam dunk refutation, but performance and productivity are highly related. reply randomdata 6 hours agorootparent> I reject that assertion. Because you don't believe the worst developer contributed anything to GPT? Sure, in reality that's no doubt true, but it was only ever meant to be illustrative. > but performance and productivity are highly related. Not in any meaningful way. The study found that the fastest developer can perform a set of defined tasks in a 10th of the time of the slowest developer. That is what the 10x developer refers to. But being fast doesn't mean being productive. Come to my backyard and we will each dig a hole of equal size. Let's assume that you can dig the hole in a 10th of the time I can – that you are the 10x hole digger. But, no matter how fast you are, neither of us will be productive. reply mathgradthrow 16 hours agorootparentprevthe worst engineer certainly has negative productivity, so I'm not sure that your explanation can possibly be the correct one. reply JimDabell 16 hours agorootparentI’m explaining what the terms “10x” and “1x” mean, not asserting that the original observation is correct under all circumstances. reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparentExcept you haven't explained it at all. Sackman, Erickson, and Grant found that some developers were able to complete what was effectively a programming contest in a 10th of the time of the slowest participants. This is the origin of the 10x developer idea. You, on the other hand, are claiming that 10x engineers are 10 times more productive than the worst engineers. Completing a programming challenge in a 10th of the time is not the same as being 10 times more productive, and obviously your usage can't be an explanation, even as one you made up on the spot, as the math doesn't add up. reply JimDabell 15 hours agorootparentThat was designed as a repeatable experiment, which seems entirely reasonable when you want to conduct a study. Why are you characterising that as “a programming contest”? That seems like an uncharitably distorted way of describing a study.

Not sure where you dreamed up the latter. reply mathgradthrow 16 hours agorootparentprevi believe the original was for an entire \"organizations\" performance, and was also done in 1977. Since they are averages, It makes \"sense\" to conclude that the best of a good team is 10x better than the average of the worst team. Not really what the experimwnt concludes but what can you do. reply JimDabell 16 hours agorootparentThe first was 1968, but there have been more studies since. https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-i... reply hattmall 16 hours agorootparentprevHmm, I never thought of it that way. I just heard 10x employees and fit it to what I knew. Which is that 90% of the work is accomplished by about 10% of workers. The other 90% really only get 10% done. So most developers are somewhere on a scale of 0.1 - 1. With 1 being a totally competent and good developer. The 10x people are just different though, it's like a pro-athlete to a regular player. It's not unique to software development, though it may stand out and be sought after more. I've noticed it in pretty much every industry. Some people are just able to achieve flow state in their work and be vastly more productive than others, be it writing code or laying sod. I don't find that there's a lot of in between 1 and 10 though. reply SkyBelow 16 hours agorootparentprevEven if this was the origin of the term, it still doesn't make sense because the best engineers can solve problems the worst would never be able to do so. The difference between the best and worst is much more than 10x the worst. Maybe the worst who meets certain minimums at a company, but then the best would also be limited by those willing to work for what the company pays, and I hypothesis that the minimums of the lower bound and the maximums of the upper bound are correlated. reply JimDabell 15 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you disagree with the concept of a 10x engineer then. In which case you should avoid using the term, rather than making up a new definition. reply robocat 15 hours agorootparentConcepts and words change meaning and sometimes we all need to accept that the popular meaning is not the definition we use. This is especially common when dealing with historical or academic definitions versus common modern usage. \"Evolution\" particularly annoys me. You should avoid using the term, rather than using a definition at odds with common usage. Your usage is confusing - and that is why you are getting push-back. The definition you have given is nonsensical - it can't be consistent over time or between companies because it depends on finding a minimum in a group. And a value that is strongly dependent on the worst developer is useless because it mostly measures how bad the worst developer is - it doesn't say anything about how good the best developer is. reply tnel77 16 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the day if I feel like a 2x or a 0.1x engineer.

Someone still needs to do the legwork. One man armies who can do everything themselves don't really fit in standardized teams where everything is compartmentalized and work divided and spread out. They work best on their own projects with nobody else in their way, no colleagues, no managers, but that's not most jobs. Once you're part of a team, you can't do too much work yourself no matter how good you are, as inevitably the other slower/weaker team members will slow you down as you'll fight dealing with the issues they introduce into the project or the issues from management, so every team moves at the speed of the lowest common denominator no matter their rockstars. reply jollyllama 18 hours agorootparentThat rings true and is probably why the 10x engineers I have seen usually work on devops or modify the framework the other devs are using in some way. For example, an engineer who speeds up a build or test suite by an order of magnitude is easily a 10x engineer in most organizations, in terms of man hours saved. reply FirmwareBurner 18 hours agorootparent> For example, an engineer who speeds up a build or test suite by an order of magnitude is easily a 10x engineer in most organizations, in terms of man hours saved. Yeah but this isn't something scalable that can happen regularly as part of your job description. Like most jobs/companies don't have so many low hanging fruits to pick that someone can speed of build by orders of magnitude on a weekly basis. It's usually a one time thing. And one time things don't usually make you a 10x dev. Maybe you just got lucky once to see something others missed. And often times at big places most people know where the low hanging fruits are and can fix them, but management, release schedules and tech debt are perpetually in the way. IMHO what makes you a 10x dev is you always know how to unblock people no matter the issue so that the project is constantly smooth saling, not chasing orders of magnitude improvements unicorns. reply tranceylc 18 hours agorootparentDoes anyone else feel like people follow these sort of industry pop-culture terms a bit too intensely? What I mean is that the existence of the term tends to bring out people trying to figure who that might be, as if it has to be 100% true. I personally think that some people can provide “10x” (arbitrary) the value on occasion, like the low hanging fruit you said. I also believe some people are slightly more skilled than others, and get more results out of their work. That said, there are so many ways for somebody to have an impact that doesn’t have to immediate, that I find the term itself too prevalent. reply lukan 15 hours agorootparent\"Does anyone else feel like people follow these sort of industry pop-culture terms a bit too intensely? \" Agreed, there is too much effort going into the \"superstars\" theme, but there are definitely people who get 10x done in the same time as others. reply t-3 15 hours agorootparentYep.

Some of those people not only get things done much quicker, but they also get it done with better quality than an amateur, with less mistakes, throwing away less material, sometimes with more safety. This is definitely more than 10x better. And there are some real hacks doing those kinds of jobs. I find programming to be not different than that. reply lukan 7 hours agorootparentWell sure, if you compare a master to a novice, there is almost always a great difference. But between masters of carpentry, there is usually not so much difference.

The order of magnitude improvements I'm describing involved interdisciplinary expertise involving both bespoke distributed build systems and assembly language.

In my experience, so called \"10x\" engineers are as productive as they are because they have a process by which they practice the development on software that anticipates future problems. As a result when they check something in, they spend very little time \"debugging\" or \"fixing bugs\" with code that does what they already need it to do. It is always very useful as an engineer to log your time, what are you working on \"right now\" and is it \"new work\" , \"maintenance work\", or \"fixing work.\" Then for each log entry that isn't \"new work\" thinking about what you could have done that would have caught that problem before it was committed to the code base. I find it is much better to evaluate engineers based on how often they are solving the same problem that they had before vs creating new stuff. That ratio, for me, is the essence of the Nx engineer (for 0.1People who implement something very few people even considered or understood to be possible, which then gives amazing leverage to deliver working software in a fraction of the time.

Do you supply your own test cases? Is it testing hardware non-determinism? reply wwilson 17 hours agorootparentPost author here. Sorry it was vague, but there's only so much detail you can go into in a blog post aimed at general audiences. Our documentation (https://antithesis.com/docs/) has a lot more info. Here's my attempt at a more complete answer: think of the story of the blind men and the elephant. There's a thing, called fuzzing, invented by security researchers. There's a thing, called property-based testing, invented by functional programmers. There's a thing, called network simulation, invented by distributed systems people. There's a thing, called rare-event simulation, invented by physicists (!). But if you squint, all of these things are really the same kind of thing, which we call \"autonomous testing\". It's where you express high-level properties of your system, and have the computer do the grunt work to see if they're true. Antithesis is our attempt to take the best ideas from each of these fields, and turn them into something really usable for the vast majority of software. We believe the two fundamental problems preventing widespread adoption of autonomous testing are: (1) most software is non-deterministic, but non-determinism breaks the core feedback loop that guides things like coverage-guided fuzzing. (2) the state space you're searching is inconceivably vast, and the search problem in full generality is insolubly hard. Antithesis tries to address both of these problems. So... is it fuzzing? Sort of, except you can apply it to whole interacting networked systems, not just standalone parsers and libraries. Is it property-based testing? Sort of, except you can express properties that require a \"global\" view of the entire state space traversed by the system, which could never be locally asserted in code. Is it fault injection or chaos testing? Sort of, except that it can use the techniques of coverage guided fuzzing to get deep into the nooks and crannies of your software, and determinism to ensure that every bug is replayable, no matter how weird it is. It's hard to explain, because it's hard to wrap your arms around the whole thing. But our other big goal is to make all of this easy to understand and easy to use. In some ways, that's proved to be even harder than the very hard technological problems we've faced. But we're excited and up for it, and we think the payoff could be big for our whole industry.

Disclosure: Antithesis co-founder. reply cperciva 15 hours agorootparentMy favourite application for \"deterministic computer\" is creating a cluster in order to have a virtual machine which is resilient to hardware failure. Potentially even \"this VM will keep running even if an entire AWS region goes down\" (although that would add significant latency). reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparentprev> most software is non-deterministic Doesn't Antithesis rely on the fact that software is always deterministic?

We’re emulating a deterministic computer, so your software can’t act nondeterministically if it tries. reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparentRight, by emulating a deterministic computer you can ensure that the inputs to the software are always deterministic – something traditional computing environments are unable to offer for various reasons. However, if we pretend that software was somehow able to be non-deterministic, it would be able to evade your deterministic computer. But since software is always deterministic, you just have to guarantee determinism in the inputs. reply _dain_ 15 hours agorootparent[I work at Antithesis] >But since software is always deterministic, you just have to guarantee determinism in the inputs. This is technically correct, but that's a very load-bearing \"just\". A lot of things would have to count as inputs. Think about execution time, for example. CPUs don't execute at the same speed all the time because of automatic throttling. Network packets have different flight times. Threads and processes get scheduled a little differently. In distributed/concurrent systems, all this matters. If you run the same workload twice, observable events will happen at different times and in different orders because of tiny deviations in initial conditions. So yes, if you consider the time it takes to run every single machine instruction as an \"input\", then software is deterministic given the same inputs. But in the real world that's not actionable. Even if you had all those inputs, how are you going to pass them in? For all intents and purposes most software execution is non-deterministic. The Antithesis simulation is deterministic in this way though. It is in charge of how long everything takes in \"simulated time\", right down to the running times of individual CPU instructions. Everything observable from within the simulation happens the exact same way, every time. You can compare a memory dump at the same (simulated) instant across two different runs and they will be bit-for-bit identical. reply randomdata 14 hours agorootparent> Think about execution time, for example. Sure. A good example. Execution time – more accurately, execution speed – isn't a property of software. For example, as you point out yourself, you can alter the execution speed without altering the software. It is, indeed, an input. > Even if you had all those inputs, how are you going to pass them in? Well, we know how to pass them in non-deterministically. That's how software is able to do anything. Perhaps one could create a simulated environment that is able to control all the inputs? In fact, I'm told there is a company known as Antithesis working on exactly that. reply mlhpdx 13 hours agorootparentprevOh, that sounds like a challenge… Is the challenge here the same as with digital simulations of electronic circuits?

I understand the fuzzing / workload generation part well, but there's so many different state space reduction techniques that I don't know what Antithesis is doing under the hood to combat that. reply crdrost 16 hours agorootparentprevThis vaguely reminds me of Jefferson's \"Virtual Time\" paper from 1985[1]. The underlying idea at the time didn't really take off because it required, like Zookeeper, a greenfield project: except that it kinda doesn't and today you could imagine instrumenting an entire Linux syscall table and letting any Linux container become a virtual time system -- but Linux didn't exist in 1985 and wouldn't be standard until much later. So Jefferson just says, let's take your I/O-ful process, split it a message-passing actor model, and monitor all the messages going in and coming out. The messages coming out, they won't necessarily do what they're supposed to do yet, they'll just be recorded with a plus sign and a virtual timestamp, and by assumption eventually you'll block on some response. So we have a bunch of recorded message timestamps coming in, we have your recorded messages going out. Well, there's a problem here, which is that if we have multiple actors we may discover that their timestamps have traveled out-of-order. You sent some message at t=532 but someone actually sent you a message at t=231 that you might have selected instead of whatever you actually selected to send the t=532 message. (For instance in the OS case, they might have literally sent a SIGKILL to your process and you might not have sent anything after that.) That's what the plus sign is for, indirectly: we can restart your process from either a known synchronization state or else from the very beginning, we know all of its inputs during its first run so we have \"determinized\" it up past t=231 to see what it does now. Now, it sends a new message at say t=373. So we use the opposite of +, the minus sign, to send to all the other processes the \"undo\" message for their t=532 message, this removes it from their message buffer: that will never be sent to them. And if they haven't hit that timestamp in their personal processing yet, no further action is needed, otherwise we need to roll them back too. Doing so you determinize the whole networked cluster. The only other really modern implementation of these older ideas that I remember seeing was Haxl[2], a Haskell library which does something similar but rather than using a virtual time coordinate, it just uses a process-local cache: when you request any I/O, it first fetches from the cache if possible and then if that's not possible it goes out, fetches the data, and then caches it. As a result you can just offer someone a pre-populated cache which, with these recorded inputs, will regenerate the offending stack trace deterministically. 1: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3916.3988 2: https://github.com/facebook/Haxl reply EasyMark 13 hours agorootparentprevthanks, I'll dig in. I'm a very visual person and charts/diagrams/flows always help my grasp of something more than a wall of text. Maybe include some of those in there when you get the time? reply kretaceous 16 hours agorootparentprevSure, it doesn't go into details. And that is exactly why I termed it an excellent introduction and a sales pitch. I haven't heard of deterministic testing before. Nor have I heard of FoundationDB or the related things. And I went from knowing zero things about them to getting impressed and interested. This led me to go into their docs, blogs, landing page, etc. to know more. reply Aeolun 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I could figure out the global idea, but then the mechanics of how it would actually work were very sparse. reply k__ 16 hours agoparentprevDid you read a different article than me? The linked article is 3/4 about some history and rationale before it actually tells you what they build. It's like those pesky recipe blogs that tell you about the authors childhood, when you just want to make vegan pancakes. reply benrutter 17 hours agoprevThis is a great pitch, and I don't want to come across as negative, but I feel like a statement like \"we found all bugs\" can only be true with a very narrow definition of bug. The most pernicious, hard-to-find bugs that I've come across have all been around the business logic of an application, rather than it hitting into an error state. I'm thinking of the category where you have something like \"a database is currently reporting a completed transaction against a customer, but no completed purchase item, how should it be displayed on the customer recent transactions page?\". Implementing something where \"a thing will appear and not crash\" in those cases is one thing, but making sure that it actually makes sense as a choice given all the context of everyone elses choices everywhere else in the stack is a lot harder. Or to take a database, something along the lines of \"our query planner produces a really suboptimal plan in this edge-case\". Neither of those types of problems could ever be automatically detected, because they aren't issues of the programming reaching an error state- the issue is figuring out in the first place what \"correct\" actually is for you application. Maybe I'm setting the bar too high for what a \"bug\" is, but I guess my point is, its one thing to fantasize about having zero bugs, its another to build software in the real world. I probably still settle for 0 run time errors though to be fair. . . reply amw-zero 17 hours agoparentI do think that it was a mistake to use the word \"all\" and imply that there are absolutely no bugs in FoundationDB. However, FoundationDB is truly known as having advanced the state of the art for testing practices: https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/testing.html. So in normal cases this would reek of someone being arrogant / overconfident, but here they really have gotten very close to zero bugs. reply spinningD20 16 hours agorootparentThe other issue I would point out is that building a database, while impressive with their quality, is still fundamentally different than an application or set of applications like a larger SaaS offering would involve (api, web, mobile, etc). Like the difference between API and UI test strategies, where API has much more clearly defined and standardized inputs and outputs. To be clear, I am not saying that you can't define all inputs and outputs of a \"complete SaaS product offering stack\", because you likely could, though if it's already been built by someone that doesn't have these things in mind, then it's a different problem space to find bugs. As someone who has spent the last 15 years championing quality strategy for companies and training folks of varying roles on how to properly assess risk, it does indeed feel like this has a more narrow scope of \"bug\" as a definition, in the sort of way that a developer could try to claim that robust unit tests would catch \"any\" bugs, or even most of them. The types of risk to a software's quality have larger surface areas than at that level. reply amw-zero 15 hours agorootparentThere's a lot of assertions that I throw into business applications that would be very useful to test in this way. So I don't think this only applies to testing databases. Also, when properties are difficult to think of, that often means that a model of the behavior might be more appropriate to test against, e.g. https://concerningquality.com/model-based-testing/. It would take a bit of design work to get this to play nicely with the Antithesis approach, but it's definitely doable. reply spinningD20 14 hours agorootparentJust to clarify, I am definitely not saying this is only useful or only applies to databases. The point was more that, I don't see how this testing approach (at the level that it functions) would catch all of the bugs that I have seen in my career, and so to say \"all of the bugs\" or even \"most of the bugs\" is definitely a stretch. This is certainly useful, just like unit tests, assertions, etc are all very useful. It's just not the whole picture of \"bugs\". reply amw-zero 14 hours agorootparentYes, there are plenty of non-functional logic bugs, e.g. performance issues. I think this starts to drastically hone in on the set of \"all\" bugs though, especially by doing things like network fault injection by default. This will trigger complex interactions between dependencies that are likely almost never tested. They should clarify that this is focused on functional logic bugs though, I agree with that. reply dclowd9901 5 hours agorootparentprevI’d go so far as to say it is actually impossible to do UI testing in some kind of web based product unless it came from the browser makers themselves. I’d settle for decent heap debugging. reply nlavezzo 16 hours agoparentprevI think the reference to \"all the bugs\" here is basically that our insanely brutal deterministic testing system was not finding any more bugs after 100's of thousands of runs. Can't prove a negative obviously, but the fact that we'd gotten to that \"all green\" status gave us a ton of confidence to push forward in feature development, believing we were building on something solid - which, time has shown we were. reply dap 15 hours agorootparentThanks -- that's very clarifying! But isn't this circular? The lack of bugs is used as evidence of the effectiveness of the testing approach, but the testing approach is validated by...not finding any more bugs in the software? reply FridgeSeal 14 hours agorootparentYeah but if your software is running in an environment that controls for a lot of non-determinism and can simulate various kinds of failures and degradations at varying rates, and do it all in accelerated time and your software is still working correctly; I think it’d be somewhat reasonable to assert that maybe the testing setup has done a pretty good job. reply dap 12 hours agorootparentAgreed, the approach sounds very interesting and I can see how it could be very effective! I'd love to try it on my own stuff. That's why it's so surprising (to me) to claim that the approach found nearly every bug in something as complicated as a production distributed database. My career experience tells me (quite strongly) that can't possibly be true. reply adamauckland 17 hours agoparentprevI consider a \"bug\" to be \"it was supposed to do something and failed\". Issues around business logic are not failures of the system, the system worked to spec, the spec was not comprehensive enough and now we iterate. reply Aachen 17 hours agorootparentWhat do you call it when the spec is wrong? Like clearly actually wrong, such as when someone copied a paragraph from one CRUD-describing page to the next and forgot to change the word \"thing1\" to \"thing2\" in the delete description. Because I'd call that a bug. A spec bug, but a bug. It's no feature request to make the code based on the newer page delete thing2 rather than thing1, it's fixing a defect reply pinkmuffinere 13 hours agorootparentYa, I would like a word for this as well. I naturally refer to this category of error as bug, but this occasionally leads to significant conflict with others at work. I now default to calling _almost everything_ a feature request, which is obviously dumb but less likely to get me into trouble. If there is a better word for \"it does exactly what we planned, but what we planned was wrong\" I would love to adopt it. reply Aachen 13 hours agorootparentI reported such a bug to some software my company uses (Tempo). Vendor proceeds to call it a feature request because the software successfully fails to show public information (visible in the UI, but HTTP 403 in the API unless you're an admin). Instead of changing one word in the code that defines the access level required for this GET call, it gets triaged as not being a bug, put on a backlog, and we never heard from it again obviously We pay for this shit reply pinkmuffinere 10 hours agorootparentSuccessful failure is my favorite kind, I like to think that all my failures are successful reply SilasX 11 hours agorootparentprevThere’s the distinction between correctness and fitness for purpose which I think is helpful for clarifying the issues here. Correctness bug: it didn’t do what the spec says it should do. Fitness for purpose bug: it does what the spec says to do, but, with better knowledge, the spec isn’t what you actually want. Edit: looks like this maps, respectively, to failing verification and failing validation. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39359673 Edit2: My earlier comment on the different things that get called \"bugs\", before I was aware of this terminology: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22259973 reply rkangel 17 hours agorootparentprevSystems Engineering has terminology for this distinction. Verification is \"does this thing do what I asked it to do\". Validation is \"did I ask it to do the right thing\". reply crashabr 15 hours agorootparentTangentially related, but I've recently started distinguishing verification and validation in my data cleaning work: verification refers to \"is this dataset clean?\" or the more precise \"does this dataset confirm my assumptions about what a what a correct dataset should be given its focus\" validation refers to \"can it answer my questions?\" or the more rigorous \"can I test my hypotheses against this dataset?\" So I find this interesting (but in hindsight unsurprising) that similar definitions are used in other fields. Would you have a source for your defintions? reply rkangel 15 hours agorootparentThey're fairly standard terms from \"old style\" project management - they show up in the usual V Model of Waterfall vein. E.g. see Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation reply zestyping 14 hours agorootparentprevA spec bug is just as bad as a code bug! Declaring a system free of defects because it matches the spec is sneaky sleight-of-hand that ignores the costs of having a spec. The actual testing value is the difference between the cost of writing and maintaining the code, and the cost of writing and maintaining the spec. If the spec is similar in complexity to the code itself, then bugs in the spec are just as likely as bugs in the code, thus verification to spec has gained you nothing (and probably cost you a lot). reply cortesoft 4 hours agorootparentprevI agree they are separate, but in my long experience, spec bugs are at least as common as your first definition. reply repelsteeltje 17 hours agorootparentprev...And now we could probably start debating your narrow definition of \"system\". ;-) reply pipo234 17 hours agorootparentMost of the software I've built doesn't have \"a spec.\", but let me zoom in on specs. around streaming media. MPEG DASH, CMAF or even the base media file format (ISO/IEC 14496-12) at times can be pretty vague. In practice, this frequently turns up in actual interoperability issues where it's pretty difficult to point out which of two products is according to spec and which one has a bug. So yes, I totally agree with GP and would actually go further: a phrase like \"we found all the bugs in the database\" is nonsense and makes the article less credible. reply dap 15 hours agoparentprevThe best definition I've heard for \"bug\" is \"software not working as documented\". Of course, a lot of software is lacking documentation -- and those are doc bugs. But I like this definition because even when the docs are incomplete, the definition guides you to ask: would I really document that the software behaves like this or would I change the behavior [and document that]?

Currently bringing a similar kind of testing in to our workplace by writing our services to run on top of `madsim` [1]. This lets us continue writing async/await-style services in tokio but then (in tests) replace them with a deterministic executor that patches all sources of non-determinism (including dependencies that call out to the OS). It's pretty seamless. The author of this article isn't joking when they say that the startup cost of this effort is monumental. Dealing with every possible source of non-determinism, re-writing services to be testable/sans-IO [2], etc. takes a lot of engineering effort. Once the system is in place though, it's hard to describe just how confident you feel in your code. Combined with tools like quickcheck [3], you can test hundreds of thousands of subtle failure cases in I/O, event ordering, timeouts, dropped packets, filesystem failures, etc. This kind of testing is an incredibly powerful tool to have in your toolbelt, if you have the patience and fortitude to invest in it. As for Antithesis itself, it looks very very cool. Bringing the deterministic testing down the stack to below the OS is awesome. Should make it possible to test entire systems without wiring up a harness manually every time. Can’t wait to try it out!

I mentioned a few orthogonal concepts that go well together, and each of the following examples has a different combination that they employ: - the company that developed Madsim (RisingWave) [0] [1] is tries hardest to eliminate non-determinism with the broadest scope (stubbing out syscalls, etc.) - sled [2] itself has an interesting combo of deterministic tests combined with quickcheck+failpoints test case auto-discovery - Dropbox [3] uses a similar approach but they talk about it a bit more abstractly. Sans-IO is more documented in Python [4], but str0m [5] and quinn-proto [6] are the best examples in Rust I’m aware of. Note that sans-IO is orthogonal to deterministic test frameworks, but it composes well with them. With the disclaimer that anything I comment on this site is my opinion alone, and does not reflect the company I work at —— I do work at a rust shop that has utilized these techniques on some projects. TigerBeetle is an amazing example and I’ve looked at it before! They are really the best example of this approach outside of FoundationDB I think.

So much complexity I've seen in such systems boils down to calling a \"function\" is: async, depends on the OS, is executed at some point or never, always returns a bunch of strings that need to be parsed to re-enter the static type system, which comes with its own set of failure modes. This makes the seemingly simple task of abstracting logic into a named component, aka a function, extremely complex. You don't need to test for any of the subtle failures you mentioned if you leave the logic inside the same process and just call a function. I know monoliths aren't always a good idea or fit, at the same time I'm highly septical whether the current prevalence of service based software architectures is justified and pays off. reply toast0 5 hours agorootparent> I can't stop but wonder how often the culture of micro-services and distributed computing is ill advised. You can't get away from distributed computing, unless you get away from computing. A modern computer isn't a single unit, it's a system of computers talking to each other. Even if you go back a long time, you'll find many computers or proto-computers talking to each other, but with a lot stricter timings, as the computers are less flexible. If you save a file to a disk, you're really asking the OS (somehow) to send a message to the computer on the storage device, asking it to store your data, and it will respond with success or failure and it might also write the data. (sometimes it will tell your os success and then proceed to throw the data away, which is always fun) That said, keeping things together where it makes sense, is definitely a good thing. reply Voultapher 3 hours agorootparentI see your point. Even multithreading can be seen as a form of distributed programming. At the same time, in my experience these parts can often be isolated. You trust your DB to handle such issues, and I'm very happy we are getting a new era of DBs like Tigerbetle, FoundationDB and sled that are designed to survive Jepsen. But how many teams are building DBs? That point is a bit ironic, given I'm currently building an in-memory DB at work. But it's a completely different level of complexity. And your example with writing a file, that too is a somewhat solved problem, use ZFS. I'd argue there are many situations where the fault tolerant distributed requirements can be served by existing abstractions. reply Rygian 20 hours agoprevThe writing is really enjoyable. > Programming in this state is like living life surrounded by a force field that protects you from all harm. [...] We deleted all of our dependencies (including Zookeeper) because they had bugs, and wrote our own Paxos implementation in very little time and it _had no bugs_. Being able to make that statement and back it by evidence must be indeed a cool thing. reply btrettel 19 hours agoparentThe earliest that I've seen the attitude that one should eliminate dependencies because they have more bugs than internally written code was this book from 1995: https://store.doverpublications.com/products/9780486152936 pp. 65-66: > The longer I have computed, the less I seem to use Numerical Software Packages. In an ideal world this would be crazy; maybe it is even a little bit crazy today. But I've been bitten too often by bugs in those Packages. For me, it is simply too frustrating to be sidetracked while solving my own problem by the need to debug somebody else's software. So, except for linear algebra packages, I usually roll my own. It's inefficient, I suppose, but my nerves are calmer. > The most troubling aspect of using Numerical Software Packages, however, is not their occasional goofs, but rather the way the packages inevitably hide deficiencies in a problem's formulation. We can dump a set of equations into a solver and it will usually give back a solution without complaint - even if the equations are quite poorly conditioned or have an unsuspected singularity that is distorting the answers from physical reality. Or it may give us an alternative solution that we failed to anticipate. The package helps us ignore these possibilities - or even to detect their occurrence if the execution is buried inside a larger program. Given our capacity for error-blindness, software that actually hides our errors from us is a questionable form of progress. > And if we do detect suspicious behavior, we really can't dig into the package to find our troubles. We will simply have to reprogram the problem ourselves. We would have been better off doing so from the beginning - with a good chance that the immersion into the problem's reality would have dispelled the logical confusions before ever getting to the machine. I suppose whether to do this depends on how rigorous one is, how rigorous certain dependencies are, and how much time one has. I'm not going to be writing my own database (too complicated, multiple well-tested options available) but if I only use a subset of the functionality of a smaller package that isn't tested well, rolling my own could make sense. reply voidmain 18 hours agorootparentIn the specific case in question, the biggest problem was that dependencies like Zookeeper weren't compatible with our testing approach, so we couldn't do true end to end tests unless we replaced them. One of the nice things about Antithesis is that because our approach to deterministic simulation is at the whole system level, we can do it against real dependencies if you can install them. I was a co-founder of both FoundationDB and Antithesis. reply spinningD20 14 hours agorootparentprevThat tracks well (both the quotes and your thoughts). One example that comes to mind where I want to roll my own thing (and am in the process of doing so) is replacing our ci/cd usage of jenkins that is solely for running qa automation tests against PR's on github. Jenkins does way way more than we need. We just need github PR interaction/webhook, secure credentials management, and spawning ecs tasks on aws...

    "title": "Stable Cascade: Efficient Image Generation with Smaller Latent Space",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableCascade",
    "originBody": "Stable Cascade This is the official codebase for Stable Cascade. We provide training & inference scripts, as well as a variety of different models you can use. This model is built upon the Würstchen architecture and its main difference to other models, like Stable Diffusion, is that it is working at a much smaller latent space. Why is this important? The smaller the latent space, the faster you can run inference and the cheaper the training becomes. How small is the latent space? Stable Diffusion uses a compression factor of 8, resulting in a 1024x1024 image being encoded to 128x128. Stable Cascade achieves a compression factor of 42, meaning that it is possible to encode a 1024x1024 image to 24x24, while maintaining crisp reconstructions. The text-conditional model is then trained in the highly compressed latent space. Previous versions of this architecture, achieved a 16x cost reduction over Stable Diffusion 1.5. Therefore, this kind of model is well suited for usages where efficiency is important. Furthermore, all known extensions like finetuning, LoRA, ControlNet, IP-Adapter, LCM etc. are possible with this method as well. A few of those are already provided (finetuning, ControlNet, LoRA) in the training and inference sections. Moreover, Stable Cascade achieves impressive results, both visually and evaluation wise. According to our evaluation, Stable Cascade performs best in both prompt alignment and aesthetic quality in almost all comparisons. The above picture shows the results from a human evaluation using a mix of parti-prompts (link) and aesthetic prompts. Specifically, Stable Cascade (30 inference steps) was compared against Playground v2 (50 inference steps), SDXL (50 inference steps), SDXL Turbo (1 inference step) and Würstchen v2 (30 inference steps). Stable Cascade´s focus on efficiency is evidenced through its architecture and a higher compressed latent space. Despite the largest model containing 1.4 billion parameters more than Stable Diffusion XL, it still features faster inference times, as can be seen in the figure below. Model Overview Stable Cascade consists of three models: Stage A, Stage B and Stage C, representing a cascade for generating images, hence the name \"Stable Cascade\". Stage A & B are used to compress images, similarly to what the job of the VAE is in Stable Diffusion. However, as mentioned before, with this setup a much higher compression of images can be achieved. Furthermore, Stage C is responsible for generating the small 24 x 24 latents given a text prompt. The following picture shows this visually. Note that Stage A is a VAE and both Stage B & C are diffusion models. For this release, we are providing two checkpoints for Stage C, two for Stage B and one for Stage A. Stage C comes with a 1 billion and 3.6 billion parameter version, but we highly recommend using the 3.6 billion version, as most work was put into its finetuning. The two versions for Stage B amount to 700 million and 1.5 billion parameters. Both achieve great results, however the 1.5 billion excels at reconstructing small and fine details. Therefore, you will achieve the best results if you use the larger variant of each. Lastly, Stage A contains 20 million parameters and is fixed due to its small size. Getting Started This section will briefly outline how you can get started with Stable Cascade. Inference Running the model can be done through the notebooks provided in the inference section. You will find more details regarding downloading the models, compute requirements as well as some tutorials on how to use the models. Specifically, there are four notebooks provided for the following use-cases: Text-to-Image A compact notebook that provides you with basic functionality for text-to-image, image-variation and image-to-image. Text-to-Image Cinematic photo of an anthropomorphic penguin sitting in a cafe reading a book and having a coffee. Image Variation The model can also understand image embeddings, which makes it possible to generate variations of a given image (left). There was no prompt given here. Image-to-Image This works just as usual, by noising an image up to a specific point and then letting the model generate from that starting point. Here the left image is noised to 80% and the caption is: A person riding a rodent. Furthermore, the model is also accessible in the diffusers 🤗 library. You can find the documentation and usage here. ControlNet This notebook shows how to use ControlNets that were trained by us or how to use one that you trained yourself for Stable Cascade. With this release, we provide the following ControlNets: Inpainting / Outpainting Face Identity Note: The Face Identity ControlNet will be released at a later point. Canny Super Resolution These can all be used through the same notebook and only require changing the config for each ControlNet. More information is provided in the inference guide. LoRA We also provide our own implementation for training and using LoRAs with Stable Cascade, which can be used to finetune the text-conditional model (Stage C). Specifically, you can add and learn new tokens and add LoRA layers to the model. This notebook shows how you can use a trained LoRA. For example, training a LoRA on my dog with the following kind of training images: Lets me generate the following images of my dog given the prompt: Cinematic photo of a dog [fernando] wearing a space suit. Image Reconstruction Lastly, one thing that might be very interesting for people, especially if you want to train your own text-conditional model from scratch, maybe even with a completely different architecture than our Stage C, is to use the (Diffusion) Autoencoder that Stable Cascade uses to be able to work in the highly compressed space. Just like people use Stable Diffusion's VAE to train their own models (e.g. Dalle3), you could use Stage A & B in the same way, while benefiting from a much higher compression, allowing you to train and run models faster. The notebook shows how to encode and decode images and what specific benefits you get. For example, say you have the following batch of images of dimension 4 x 3 x 1024 x 1024: You can encode these images to a compressed size of 4 x 16 x 24 x 24, giving you a spatial compression factor of 1024 / 24 = 42.67. Afterwards you can use Stage A & B to decode the images back to 4 x 3 x 1024 x 1024, giving you the following output: As you can see, the reconstructions are surprisingly close, even for small details. Such reconstructions are not possible with a standard VAE etc. The notebook gives you more information and easy code to try it out. Training We provide code for training Stable Cascade from scratch, finetuning, ControlNet and LoRA. You can find a comprehensive explanation for how to do so in the training folder. Remarks The codebase is in early development. You might encounter unexpected errors or not perfectly optimized training and inference code. We apologize for that in advance. If there is interest, we will continue releasing updates to it, aiming to bring in the latest improvements and optimizations. Moreover, we would be more than happy to receive ideas, feedback or even updates from people that would like to contribute. Cheers.

Right away it seems the quality is worse compared to some SDXL models but I’ll reserve judgement until a couple more days of testing. It’s fast too! I would reckon about 2-3x faster than non-turbo SDXL. reply vergessenmir 12 hours agoparentI'll take prompt adherence over quality any day. The machinery otherwise isn't worth it i.e the controlnets, openpose, depthmaps just to force a particular look or to achieve depth. Th solution becomes bespoke for each generation. Had a test of it and my option is it's an improvement when it comes to following prompts and I do find the images more visually appealing. reply stavros 12 hours agorootparentCan we use its output as input to SDXL? Presumably it would just fill in the details, and not create whole new images. reply RIMR 10 hours agorootparentI was thinking that exactly. You could use the same trick as the hires-fix for an adherence-fix. reply emadm 5 hours agorootparentYeah chain it in comfy to a turbo model for detail reply sorenjan 15 hours agoparentprevHow much VRAM does it need? They mention that the largest model uses 1.4 billion parameters more than SDXL, which in turn need a lot of VRAM. reply liuliu 14 hours agorootparentShould use no more than 6GiB for FP16 models at each stage. The current implementation is not RAM optimized. reply sorenjan 14 hours agorootparentThe large C model uses 3.6 billion parameters which is 6.7 GiB if each parameter is 16 bits. reply liuliu 14 hours agorootparentThe large C model have fair bit of parameters tied to text-conditioning, not to the main denoising process. Similar to how we split the network for SDXL Base, I am pretty confident we can split non-trivial amount of parameters to text-conditioning hence during denoising process, loading less than 3.6B parameters. reply brucethemoose2 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat's more, they can presumably be swapped in and out like the SDXL base + refiner, right? reply adventured 14 hours agorootparentprevThere was a leak from Japan yesterday, prior to this release, and in that it was suggested 20gb for the largest model. This text was part of the Stability Japan leak (the 20gb VRAM reference was dropped in the release today): \"Stages C and B will be released in two different models. Stage C uses parameters of 1B and 3.6B, and Stage B uses parameters of 700M and 1.5B. However, if you want to minimize your hardware needs, you can also use the 1B parameter version. In Stage B, both give great results, but 1.5 billion is better at reconstructing finer details. Thanks to Stable Cascade's modular approach, the expected amount of VRAM required for inference can be kept at around 20GB, but can be reduced even further by using smaller variations (as mentioned earlier, this (which may reduce the final output quality).\" reply sorenjan 14 hours agorootparentThanks. I guess this means that fewer people will be able to use it on their own computer, but the improved efficiency makes it cheaper to run on servers with enough VRAM. Maybe running stage C first, unloading it from VRAM, and then do B and A would make it fit in 12 or even 8 GB, but I wonder if the memory transfers would negate any time saving. Might still be worth it if it produces better images though. reply Filligree 14 hours agorootparentSequential model offloading isn’t too bad. It adds about a second or less to inference, assuming it still fits in main memory. reply sorenjan 14 hours agorootparentSometimes I forget how fast modern computers are. PCIe v4 x16 has a transfer speed of 31.5 GB/s, so theoretically it should take less than 100 ms to transfer stage B and A. Maybe it's not so bad after all, it will be interesting to see what happens. reply adventured 14 hours agorootparentprevIf it worked I imagine large batching could make it worth the load/unload time cost. reply kimoz 16 hours agoparentprevCan one run it on CPU? reply rwmj 15 hours agorootparentStable Diffusion on a 16 core AMD CPU takes for me about 2-3 hours to generate an image, just to give you a rough idea of the performance. (On the same AMD's iGPU it takes 2 minutes or so). reply OJFord 15 hours agorootparentEven older GPUs are worth using then I take it? For example I pulled a (2GB I think, 4 tops) 6870 out of my desktop because it's a beast (in physical size, and power consumption) and I wasn't using it for gaming or anything, figured I'd be fine just with the Intel integrated graphics. But if I wanted to play around with some models locally, it'd be worth putting it back & figuring out how to use it as a secondary card? reply rwmj 15 hours agorootparentOne counterintuitive advantage of the integrated GPU is it has access to system RAM (instead of using a dedicated and fixed amount of VRAM). That means I'm able to give the iGPU 16 GB of RAM. For me SD takes 8-9 GB of RAM when running. The system RAM is slower than VRAM which is the trade-off here. reply OJFord 15 hours agorootparentYeah I did wonder about that as I typed, which is why I mentioned the low amount (by modern standards anyway) on the card. OK, thanks! reply mat0 15 hours agorootparentprevNo, I don't think so. I think you would need more VRAM to start with. reply purpleflame1257 13 hours agorootparentprev2GB is really low. I've been able to use A111 stable diffusion on my old gaming laptop's 1060 (6GB VRAM) and it takes a little bit less than a minute to generate an image.

They tweaked the architecture quite a bit, trained on their own dataset, reused some components (or in Emu case, trained all the components from scratch but reused the same arch). reply jonplackett 15 hours agorootparentprevHow do you know though? reply minimaxir 15 hours agorootparentYou can't use off-the-shelf models to get the results Midjourney and DALL-E generate, even with strong finetuning. reply cthalupa 15 hours agorootparentI pay for both MJ and DALL-E (though OpenAI mostly gets my money for GPT) and don't find them to produce significantly better images than popular checkpoints on CivitAI. What I do find is that they are significantly easier to work with. (Actually, my experience with hundreds of DALL-E generations is that it's actually quite poor in quality. I'm in several IRC channels where it's the image generator of choice for some IRC bots, and I'm never particularly impressed with the visual quality.) For MJ in particular, knowing that they at least used to use Stable Diffusion under the hood, it would not surprise me if the majority of the secret sauce is actually a middle layer that processes the prompt and converts it to one that is better for working with SD. Prompting SD to get output at the MJ quality level takes significantly more tokens, lots of refinement, heavy tweaking of negative prompting, etc. Also a stack of embeddings and LoRAs, though I would place those more in the category of finetuning like you had mentioned. reply emadm 14 hours agorootparentIf you try diffusionGPT with regional prompting added and a GAN corrector you can get a good idea of what is possible https://diffusiongpt.github.io reply euazOn 12 hours agorootparentThat looks very impressive unless the demo is cherrypicked, would be great if this could be implemented into a frontend like Fooocus https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus reply millgrove 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you use it for?

DALL-E has: it generalizes well (can make objects interact properly for example) and has great prompt adherence. But it can also be unpredictable as hell because it rewrites the prompts. DALL-E's quality is meh - it has terrible artifacts on all pixel-sized details, hallucinations on small details, and limited resolution. Controlnets, finetuning/zero-shot reference transfer, and open tooling would have made a beast of a model of it, but they aren't available. reply yreg 12 hours agorootparentprevThat's not really true, MJ and DALL-E are just more beginner friendly. reply programjames 14 hours agorootparentprevI think it'd be interesting to have a non-profit \"model sharing\" platform, where people can buy/sell compute. When you run someone's model, they get royalties on the compute you buy. reply minimaxir 15 hours agorootparentprevMore specifically, it's so Stability AI can theoretically make a business on selling commercial access to those models through a membership: https://stability.ai/news/introducing-stability-ai-membershi... reply thatguysaguy 12 hours agorootparentprevThe net flow of knowledge about text-to-image generation from OpenAI has definitely been outward. The early open source methods used CLIP, which OpenAI came up with. Dall-e (1) was also the first demonstration that we could do text to image at all. (There were some earlier papers which could give you a red splotch if you said stop sign or something years earlier). reply yogorenapan 15 hours agorootparentprev> AI desperately needs a GPL equivalent Why not just the GPL then? reply loudmax 14 hours agorootparentThe GPL was intended for computer code that gets compiled to a binary form. You can share the binary, but you also have to share the code that the binary is compiled from. Pre-trained model weights might be thought of as analogous to compiled code, and the training data may be analogous to program code, but they're not the same thing. The model weights are shared openly, but the training data used to create these models isn't. This is at least partly because all these models, including OpenAI's, are trained on copyrighted data, so the copyright status of the models themselves is somewhat murky. In the future we may see models that are 100% trained in the open, but foundational models are currently very expensive to train from scratch. Either prices would need to come down, or enthusiasts will need some way to share radically distributed GPU resources. reply emadm 14 hours agorootparentTbh I think these models will largely be trained on synthetic datasets in the future. They are mostly trained on garbage now. We have been doing opt outs on these, has been interesting to see quality differential (or lack thereof), eg removing books3 from stableLM 3b zephyr https://stability.wandb.io/stability-llm/stable-lm/reports/S... reply keenmaster 12 hours agorootparentWhy aren’t the big models trained on synthetic datasets now? What’s the bottleneck? And how do you avoid amplifying the weaknesses of LLMs when you train on LLM output vs. novel material from the comparatively very intelligent members of the human species. Would be interesting to see your take on this. reply emadm 5 hours agorootparentWe are starting to see that, see phi2 for example There are approaches to get the right type of augmented and generated data to feed these models right, check out our QDAIF paper we worked on for example https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13032.pdf reply sillysaurusx 11 hours agorootparentprevI’ve wondered whether books3 makes a difference, and how much. If you ever train a model with a proper books3 ablation I’d be curious to know how it does. Books are an important data source, but if users find the model useful without them then that’s a good datapoint. reply emadm 9 hours agorootparentWe did try stableLM 3b4 with books3 and it got worse in general and benchmarks Just did some pes2o ablations too which were eh reply sillysaurusx 9 hours agorootparentWhat I mean is, it’s important to train a model with and without books3. That’s the only way to know whether it was books3 itself causing the issue, or some artifact of the training process. One thing that’s hard to measure is the knowledge contained in books3. If someone asks about certain books, it won’t be able to give an answer unless the knowledge is there in some form. I’ve often wondered whether scraping the internet is enough rather than training on books directly. But be careful about relying too much on evals. Ultimately the only benchmark that matters is whether users find the model useful. The clearest test of this would be to train two models side by side, with and without books3, and then ask some people which they prefer. It’s really tricky to get all of this right. But if there’s more details on the pes2o ablations I’d be curious to see. reply protomikron 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat about CC licenses for model weights? It's common for files (\"images\", \"video\", \"audio\", ...) So maybe appropriate. reply diggan 15 hours agoparentprevI've seen Emad (Stability AI founder) commenting here on HN somewhere about this before, what exactly their business model is/will be, and similar thoughts.

Is it legal to use an older snapshot before the license was changed in accordance with the previous MIT license? reply ed 14 hours agoparentIt seems pretty clear the intent was to use a non-commercial license, so it’s probably something that would go to court, if you really wanted to press the issue. Generally courts are more holistic and look at intent, and understand that clerical errors happen. One exception to this is if a business claims it relied on the previous license and invested a bunch of resources as a result. I believe the timing of commits is pretty important— it would be hard to claim your business made a substantial investment on a pre-announcement repo that was only MIT’ed for a few hours. reply RIMR 10 hours agorootparentIf I clone/fork that repo before the license change, and start putting any amount of time into developing my own fork in good faith, they shouldn't be allowed to claim a clerical error when they lied to me upon delivery about what I was allowed to do with the code. Licenses are important. If you are going to expose your code to the world, make sure it has the right license. If you publish your code with the wrong license, you shouldn't be allowed to take it back. Not for an organization of this size that is going to see a new repo cloned thousands of times upon release. reply wokwokwok 2 hours agorootparentNo, sadly this won’t fly in court. For the same reason you cannot publish a private corporate repo with an MIT license and then have other people claim in “good faith” to be using it. All they need is to assert that the license was published in error, or that the person publishing it did not have the authority to publish it. You can’t “magically” make a license stick by putting it in a repo, any more than putting a “name here” sticker on someone’s car and then claiming to own it. The license file in the repo is simply the notice of the license. It does not indicate a binding legal agreement. You of course, can challenge it in court, and ianal, but I assure you, there is president in incorrectly labelled repos removing and changing their licenses. reply ed 9 hours agorootparentprevThere’s no case law here, so if you’re volunteering to find out what a judge thinks we’d surely appreciate it! reply OJFord 15 hours agoparentprevYes, you can continue to do what you want with that commit^ in accordance with the MIT licence it was released under. Kind of like if you buy an ebook, and then they publish a second edition but only as a hardback - the first edition ebook is still yours to read. reply treesciencebot 15 hours agoparentprevI think the model architecture (training code etc.) itself is still under MIT while the weights (which was the result of training in a huge GPU cluster as well as the dataset they have used [not sure if they publicly talked about it] is under this new license. reply emadm 14 hours agorootparentCode is MIT, weights are under the NC license for now. reply RIMR 10 hours agoparentprevMIT license is not parasitic like GPL. You can close an MIT licensed codebase, but you cannot retroactively change the license of the old code. Stability's initial commit had an MIT license, so you can fork that commit and do whatever you want with it. It's MIT licensed. Now, the tricky part here is that they committed a change to the license that changes it from MIT to proprietary, but they didn't change any code with it. That is definitely invalid, because they cannot license the exact same codebase with two different contradictory licenses. They can only license the changes made to the codebase after the license change. I wouldn't call it \"illegal\", but it wouldn't stand up in court if they tried to claim that the software is proprietary, because they already distributed it verbatim with an open license. reply kruuuder 9 hours agorootparent> they didn't change any code with it. That is definitely invalid, because they cannot license the exact same codebase with two different contradictory licenses. Why couldn't they? Of course they can.

We generally turn it off for popular models so people can see the underlying inference speed and the results but we forgot about it for this one, it should now be auth-less with a stricter rate limit just like other popular models in the gallery. reply RIMR 10 hours agorootparentI just got rate-limited on my first generation. The message is \"You have exceeded the request limit per minute\". This was after showing me cli output suggesting that my image was being generated. I guess my zero attempts per minute was too much.

In my case in most of images I made about basketball there were more than one ball. I'm not an expert, but some fundamental constrains of the human (cultural) life (like all piano keys are the same, there's only one ball in a game) are not grasped by the training or grasped partially reply pxoe 8 hours agoprevthe way it's written about in Image Reconstruction section like it is just an image compression thing...is kind of interesting. for that stuff and its presented use there to be very much about storing images and reconstructing them. when \"it doesn't actually store original images\" and \"it can't actually give out original images\" are points that get used so often in arguments as a defense for image generators. so it is just a multi-image compression file format, just a very efficient one. sure, it's \"redrawing\"/\"rendering\" its output and makes things look kinda fuzzy, but any other compressed image format does that as well. what was all that 'well it doesn't do those things' nonsense about then? clearly it can do that. reply gmerc 7 hours agoparentUltimately this is abstraction not compression. reply wongarsu 8 hours agoparentprevIn a way it's just an algorithm than can compress either text or an image. The neat trick is that if you compress the text \"brown bear hitting Vladimir Putin\" and then decompress it as an image, you get an image of a bear hitting Vladimir Putin. This principle is the idea behind all Stable Diffusion models, this one \"just\" achieved a much better compression ratio reply pxoe 8 hours agorootparentwell yeah. but it's not so much about what it actually does, but how they talk about it. maybe (probably) i missed them putting out something that's described like that before, but it's just the open admission in demonstration of it. i guess they're getting more brazen, given than they're not really getting punished for what they're doing, be it piracy or infringement or whatever. reply lqcfcjx 5 hours agoprevI'm very impressed by the recent AI progress on making models smaller and more efficient.

But yeah, the inference speed improvement is mediocre (until I take a look at exactly what computation performed to have more informed opinion on whether it is implementation issue or model issue). The prompt alignment should be better though. It looks like the model have more parameters to work with text conditioning. reply treesciencebot 14 hours agorootparentin my observation, it yields amazing perf at higher batch sizes (4 or better 8). i assume it is due to memory bandwith and the constrained latent space helping. reply GaggiX 12 hours agoparentprevI think that this model used consistency loss during training so that it can yield better results with less steps. reply SECourses 6 hours agoprevIt is pretty good I shared a comparison on medium https://medium.com/@furkangozukara/stable-cascade-prompt-fol...

Not entirely sure we'll be in the Stable Cascade race quite yet. Since Auto/Comfy aren't really built for businesses, they'll get it incorporated sooner vs later. Invoke's main focus is building open-source tools for the pros using this for work that are getting disrupted, and non-commercial licenses don't really help the ones that are trying to follow the letter of the license.

    "originBody": "Author Name Xe Iaso pony.social/@cadey pony.social/@cadey Image by Annie Ruygt We’re Fly.io, we’re a new public cloud that lets you put your compute where it matters: near your users. Today we’re announcing that you can do this with GPUs too, allowing you to do AI workloads on the edge. Want to find out more? Keep reading. AI is pretty fly AI is apparently a bit of a thing (maybe even an thing come to think about it). We’ve seen entire industries get transformed in the wake of ChatGPT existing (somehow it’s only been around for a year, I can’t believe it either). It’s likely to leave a huge impact on society as a whole in the same way that the Internet did once we got search engines. Like any good venture-capital funded infrastructure provider, we want to enable you to do hilarious things with AI using industrial-grade muscle. Fly.io lets you run a full-stack app - or an entire dev platform based on the Fly Machines API - close to your users. Fly.io GPUs let you attach an Nvidia A100 to whatever you’re building, harnessing the full power of CUDA with more VRAM than your local 4090 can shake a ray-traced stick at. With these cards (or whatever you call a GPU attached to SXM fabric), AI/ML workloads are at your fingertips. You can recognize speech, segment text, summarize articles, synthesize images, and more at speeds that would make your homelab blush. You can even set one up as your programming companion with your model of choice in case you’ve just not been feeling it with the output of other models changing over time. If you want to find out more about what these cards are and what using them is like, check out What are these “GPUs” really? It covers the history of GPUs and why it’s ironic that the cards we offer are called “Graphics Processing Units” in the first place. Fly.io GPUs in Action We want you to deploy your own code with your favorite models on top of Fly.io’s cloud backbone. Fly.io GPUs make this really easy. You can get a GPU app running Ollama (our friends in text generation) in two steps: Put this in your fly.toml: app = \"sandwich_ai\" primary_region = \"ord\" vm.size = \"a100-40gb\" [build] image = \"ollama/ollama\" [mounts] source = \"models\" destination = \"/root/.ollama\" initial_size = \"100gb\" Run fly apps create sandwich_ai && fly deploy. If you want to read more about how to start your new sandwich empire, check out Scaling Large Language Models to zero with Ollama, it explains how to set up Ollama so that it automatically scales itself down when it’s not in use. The speed of light is only so fast Being able to spin up GPUs is great, but where Fly.io really shines is inference at the edge. Let’s say you have an app that lets users enter ingredients they have in their kitchen and receive a sandwich recipe. Your users expect their recipes instantly (or at least as fast as the other leading apps). Seconds count when you need an emergency sandwich. It’s depressingly customary in the AI industry to cherry-pick outputs. This was not cherry-picked. I used yi:34b to generate this recipe. I’m not sure what a taco salad sandwich is, but I might be willing to try it. In the previous snippet, we deployed our app to ord (primary_region = \"ord\"). The good news is that our model returns a result really quickly and users in Chicago get instant sandwich recipes. It’s a good experience for users near your datacentre, and you can do this on any half decent cloud provider. But surely people outside of Chicago need sandwiches too. Amsterdam has sandwich fiends as well. And sometimes it takes too long to have their requests leap across the pond. The speed of light is only so fast after all. Don’t worry, we’ve got your back. Fly.io has GPUs in datacentres all over the world. Even more, we’ll let you run the same program with the same public IP address and the same TLS certificates in any regions with GPU support. Don’t believe us? See how you can scale your app up in Amsterdam with one command: fly scale count 2 --region ams It’s that easy. Actually On-Demand GPUs are powerful parallel processing packages, but they’re not cheap! Once we have enough people wanting to turn their fridge contents into tasty sandwiches, keeping a GPU or two running makes sense. But we’re just a small app still growing our user base while also funding the latest large sandwich model research. We want to only pay for GPUs when a user makes a request. Let’s open up that fly.toml again, and add a section called services, and we’ll include instructions on how we want our app to scale up and down: [[services]] internal_port = 8080 protocol = \"tcp\" auto_stop_machines = true auto_start_machines = true min_machines_running = 0 Now when no one needs sandwich recipes, you don’t pay for GPU time. The Deets We have GPUs ready to use in several US and EU regions and Sydney. You can deploy your sandwich, music generation, or AI illustration apps to: Ampere A100s with 40gb of RAM for $2.50/hr Ampere A100s with 80gb of RAM for $3.50/hr Lovelace L40s are coming soon (update: now here!) for $2.50/hr By default, anything you deploy to GPUs will use eight heckin’ AMD EPYC CPU cores, and you can attach volumes up to 500 gigabytes. We’ll even give you discounts for reserved instances and dedicated hosts if you ask nicely. We hope you have fun with these new cards and we’d love to see what you can do with them! Reach out to us on X (formerly Twitter) or the community forum and share what you’ve been up to. We’d love to see what we can make easier!

    "commentBody": "Fly.io has GPUs now (fly.io)447 points by andes314 11 hours agohidepastfavorite138 comments k8svet 7 hours agoDoes it have basic functioning other stuff? I am shocked at how our production usage of Fly has gone. Even basic stuff as support not being able to just... look up internal platform issues. Cryptic/non-existent error messages. I'm not impressed. It feels like it's compelling to those scared of or ignorant of Kubernetes. I thought I was over Kubernetes, but Fly makes me miss it. reply parhamn 2 hours agoparentI was hoping to migrate to Fly.io and during my testing I found that simple deploys would drop connections for a few seconds during a deploy switch over. Try a `watch -n 2 curl ` during a deploy to see for yourself (try any one of the the strategies documented including blue-green). I wonder how many people know this? When I tested it I was hoping for at worst early termination of old connections with no dropped new connections and at best I expected them to gracefully wait for old connections to finish. But nope, just a full downtime switch over every time. But then when you think about the network topology described in their blog posts, you realize theres no way it could've been done correctly to begin with. It's very rare for me to comment negatively on a service but that fact that this was the case paired with the way support acted like we were crazy when we sent video evidence of it definitely irked me for infrastructure company standards. Wouldn't recommend it outside of toy applications now. > It feels like it's compelling to those scared of or ignorant of Kubernetes I've written pretty large deployment systems for kubernetes. This isn't it. Theres a real space for heroku-like deploys done properly and no one is really doing it well (or at least without ridiculously thin or expensive compute resources) reply sofixa 1 hour agorootparent> I've written pretty large deployment systems for kubernetes. This isn't it. Theres a real space for heroku-like deploys done properly and no one is really doing it well (or at least without ridiculously thin or expensive compute resources) Have you tried Google Cloud Run(based on KNative) I've never used it in production, but on paper seems to fit the bill. reply parhamn 1 hour agorootparentYeah we're mostly hosted there now. The cpu/virtualization feels slow but I haven't had time to confirm (we had to offload super small ffmepg operations). It's in a weird place between heroku and lambda. If your container has a bad startup time like one of our python services, autoscaling can't be used as latency becomes a pain. Its also common deploy services on there that need things like health checks (unlike functions which you assume are alive), this assumes at least 1 instance of sustained use as well, assuming you do minute health checks. Their domain mapping service is also really really bad and can take hours to issue a cert for a domain so you have to be very careful about putting a lb in front of it for hostname migrations. I don't care right now but the fact that we're paying 5x in compute is starting to bother me a bit. A 8core 16gb 'node' is ~$500/month ($100 on DO) assuming you don't scale to zero (which you probably wont). Plus I'm pretty sure the 8 cores reported isn't a meaty 8 cores. But its been pretty stable and nice to use otherwise! reply dig1 1 hour agorootparentprevI have yet to gain positive experience with Cloud Run. I have one project with it, and Cloud Run is very unpredictable with autoscaling. Sometimes, it can start spinning up/down containers without any apparent reason, and after hunting Google support for months, they said it is an \"expected behavior\". Good luck trying to debug this independently because you don't have access to knative logs. Starting containers on Cloud Run is weirdly slow, and oh boy, how expensive that thing is. I'm getting the impression that pure VMs + Nomad would be a way better option. reply parhamn 21 minutes agorootparent> Starting containers on Cloud Run is weirdly slow What is this about? I assumed a highly throttled cpu or terrible disk performance. A python process that would start in 4 seconds locally could easily take 30 seconds there. reply asaddhamani 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah I had a similar experience where I got builds frozen for a couple days, such that I was not able to release any updates. When I emailed their support, I got an auto-response asking me to post in the forum. Pretty much all hosts are expected to offer a ticket system even for their unmanaged services if its a problem on their side. I just moved over all my stuff to Render.com, it's more expensive, but its been reliable so far. reply rollcat 1 hour agorootparentprev> Try a `watch -n 2 curl ` during a deploy You need blackbox HTTP monitoring right now, don't ever wait for your customer to tell you that your service is down. I use Prometheus (&Grafana), but you can also get a hosted service like Pingdom or whatever. reply xena 5 hours agoparentprevCan you email the first two letters of my username at fly.io with more details?

Couldn’t deploy for 2 days once and they actually told me to use another company. Unmanaged dbs masquerading as managed. Random downtime. I could go on but it’s not a production ready service and I moved off of it months ago. reply biorach 2 hours agorootparent> Unmanaged dbs masquerading as managed Are you talking about fly postgres? Because I use it and feel they've been pretty clear that it's unmanaged. reply morgante 59 minutes agoparentprevUnfortunately this is a pretty common story. Half the people I know who adopted Fly migrated off it. I was very excited about Fly originally, and built an entire orchestrator on top of Fly machines—until they had a multi-day outage where it took days to even get a response. Kubernetes can be complex, but at least that complexity is (a) controllable and (b) fairly well-trodden. reply awestroke 2 hours agoparentprevI have run several services on Fly for almost a year now, have not had any issues. reply chachra 5 hours agoparentprevBeen on it 7 months, 0 issues. Feel like you're alone on this potentially. reply weird-eye-issue 4 hours agorootparentAlone? Every thread about Fly has complaints about reliability and people complain about it on Twitter too reply chachra 3 hours agorootparentok possibly not alone, maybe the issues happened before I started using them extensively. I've had ~no downtime that affects me in 7 months. I do wish they had some features I need, but their support and responses are top notch. And I've lost much less hair and time than I would going full-blown AWS or another cloud provider. reply nixgeek 3 hours agorootparentprevThat hasn’t been my experience with Fly but I’m sorry to hear it seems to be others :( reply uo21tp5hoyg 2 hours agorootparentprevhttps://community.fly.io/t/reliability-its-not-great/11253 reply heeton 1 hour agorootparentprevNot alone, I’ve been part of two teams who have evaluated fly and hit weird reliability or stability issues, deemed it not ready yet. reply xena 9 hours agoprevHi, author of the post and Fly.io devrel here in case anyone has any questions. GPUs went GA yesterday, you can experiment with them to your heart's content should the fraud algorithm machine god smile upon you. I'm mostly surprised my signal post about what the \"GPUs\" are didn't land well here: https://fly.io/blog/what-are-these-gpus-really/ If anyone has any questions, fire away! reply benreesman 4 hours agoparentI'd be fascinated to hear your thoughts on Apple hardware for inference in particular. I spend a lot of time tuning up inference to run locally for people with Apple Silicon on-prem or even on-desk, and I estimate a lot of headroom left even with all the work that's gone into e.g. GGUF. Do you think the process node advantage and SoC/HBM-first will hold up long enough for the software to catch up? High-end Metal gear looks expensive until you compare it to NVIDIA with 64Gb+ of reasonably high memory bandwidth attached to dedicated FP vector units :) One imagines that being able to move inference workloads on and off device with a platform like `fly.io` would represent a lot of degrees of freedom for edge-heavy applications. reply xena 2 hours agorootparentWell, let me put it this way. I have a MacBook with 64 GB of vram so I can experiment with making an old-fashioned x.ai clone (the meeting scheduling one, not the \"woke chatgpt\" one) amongst other things now. I love how Apple Silicon makes things vroomy on my laptop. I do know that getting those working in a cloud provider setup is a \"pain in the ass\" (according to ex-AWS friends) so I don't personally have hope in seeing that happen in production. However, the premise makes me laugh so much, so who knows? :) reply Nevin1901 5 hours agoparentprevHow fast are coldstarts, and how do you compare against other gpu providers (runpod modal etc) reply xena 2 hours agorootparentThe slowest part is loading weights into vram in my experience. I haven't done benchmarking on that. What kind of benchmark would you like to see? reply ipsum2 1 hour agorootparentI would like to see time to first inference for typical models (llama-7b first token, SDXL 1 step, etc) reply thangngoc89 4 hours agoparentprevThis is right on time. I'm evaluating \"severless\" GPU services for my upcoming project. I see on the announcement that pricing is per hours. Is scaling to zero priced based on minutes/seconds? For my workflow, medical image segmentation, one file takes about 5 minutes. reply qeternity 9 hours agoparentprevI posted further down before seeing your comment. First, congrats on the launch! But who is the target user of this service? Is this mostly just for existing fly.io customers who want to keep within the fly.io sandbox? reply xena 8 hours agorootparentPart of it is for people that want to do GPU things on their fly.io networks. One of the big things I do personally is I made Arsène (https://arsene.fly.dev) a while back as an exploration of the \"dead internet\" theory. Every 12 hours it pokes two GPUs on Fly.io to generate article prose and key art with Mixtral (via Ollama) and an anime-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model named Kohaku-XL. Frankly, I also see the other part of it as a way to ride the AI hype train to victory. Having powerful GPUs available to everyone makes it easy to experiment, which would open Fly.io as an option for more developers. I think \"bring your own weights\" is going to be a compelling story as things advance. reply gooseyman 6 hours agorootparenthttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory What have you learned from the exploration? reply xena 6 hours agorootparentEnough that I'd probably need to write a blogpost about it and answer some questions that I have about it. The biggest one I want to do is a sentiment analysis of these horoscopes vs market results to see if they are \"correct\". reply cosmojg 5 hours agorootparentprevInteresting setup! What's the monthly cost of running Arsène on fly.io? reply xena 3 hours agorootparentBecause I have secret magical powers that you probably don't, it's basically free for me. Here's the breakdown though: The application server uses Deno and Fresh (https://fresh.deno.dev) and requires a shared-1x CPU at 512 MB of ram. That's $3.19 per month as-is. It also uses 2GB of disk volume, which would cost $0.30 per month. As far as post generation goes: when I first set it up it used GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate prose. That cost me rounding error per month (maybe like $0.05?). At some point I upgraded it to GPT-4 Turbo for free-because-I-got-OpenAI-credits-on-the-drama-day reasons. The prose level increase wasn't significant. With the GPU it has now, a cold load of the model and prose generation run takes about 1.5 minutes. If I didn't have reasons to keep that machine pinned to a GPU (involving other ridiculous ventures), it would probably cost about 5 minutes per day (increased the time to make the math easier) of GPU time with a 40 GB volume (I now use Nous Hermes Mixtral at Q5_K_M precision, so about 32 GB of weights), so something like $6 per month for the volume and 2.5 hours of GPU time, or about $6.25 per month on an L40s. In total it's probably something like $15.75 per month. That's a fair bit on paper, but I have certain arrangements that make it significantly less cheap for me. I could re-architect Arsène to not have to be online 24/7, but it's frankly not worth it when the big cost is the GPU time and weights volume. I don't know of a way to make that better without sacrificing model quality more than I have to. For a shitpost though, I think it'd totally worth it to pay that much. It's kinda hilarious and I feel like it makes for a decent display of how bad things could get if we go full \"AI replaces writers\" like some people seem to want for some reason I can't even begin to understand. I still think it's funny that I have to explicitly tell people to not take financial advice from it, because if I didn't then they will. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't the target user, but the boy's been using it at the soil bacteria lab he works in to do basecalling for a FAST5 data from a nanopore sequencer. reply subarctic 9 hours agorootparentprevCommenters like this, for one thing: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34242767 reply yla92 7 hours agoparentprevNot a question but the link \"Lovelace L40s are coming soon (pricing TBD)\" is 404. reply thangngoc89 5 hours agorootparentIf it's a link to nvidia.com then it's expected to be broken.

They should fix their basic features before adding new ones. reply urduntupu 44 minutes agoparentUnfortunately true. Also jumped the fly.io ship after initial high excitement for their offering. Moved back to DigitalOcean's app platform. A bit more config effort, significantly pricier, but we need stability on production. Can't have my customers call me b/c of service interruption. reply throwaway220033 34 minutes agoparentprev+1 - It's the most unreliable hosting service I've ever used in my life with \"nice looking\" packaging. There were frequently multiple things broken at same time, status page would always be green while my meetings and weekends were ruined. Software can be broken but Fly handles incidents with unprofessional, immature attitude. Basically you pay 10x more money for an unreliable service that just looks \"nice\". I'm paying 4x less to much better hardware with Hetzner + Kamal; it works reliably, pricing is predictable, I don't pay 25% more for the same usage next month. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36808296 reply niz4ts 9 hours agoprevAs far as I know, Fly uses Firecracker for their VMs. I've been following Firecracker for a while now (even using it in a project), and they don't support GPUs out of the box (and have no plan to support it [1]). I'm curious to know how Fly figured their own GPU support with Firecracker. In the past they had some very detailed technical posts on how they achieved certain things, so I'm hoping we'll see one on their GPU support in the future! [1]: https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/11... reply mrkurt 9 hours agoparentThe simple spoiler is that the GPU machines use Cloud Hypervisor, not Firecracker. reply niz4ts 9 hours agorootparentWay simpler than what I was expecting! Any notes to share about Cloud Hypervisor vs Firecracker operationally? I'm assuming the bulkier Cloud Hypervisor doesn't matter much compared to the latency of most GPU workloads. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentThey are operationally pretty much identical. In both cases, we drive them through a wrapper API server that's part of our orchestrator. Building the cloud-hypervisor wrapper took me all of about 2 hours. reply iambateman 11 hours agoprevIt’s cool to see that they can handle scaling down to zero. Especially for working on experimental sites that don’t have the users to justify even modest server costs. I would love an example on how much time a request charges. Obviously it will vary, but is it 2 seconds or “minimum 60 seconds per spin up”? reply mrkurt 11 hours agoparentWe charge from the time you boot a machine until it stops. There's no enforced minimum, but in general it's difficult to get much out of a machine in less than 5 seconds. For GPU machines, depending on data size for whatever is going into GPU memory, it could need 30s of runtime to be useful. reply sodality2 11 hours agorootparentHow long does model loading take? Loading 19GB into a machine can't be instantaneous (especially if the model is a network share). reply carl_dr 10 hours agorootparentIt takes about 7s to load a 9GB model on Beam (they claim, and tested as about right), I imagine it is similar with Fly - I've not had any performance issues with Fly. reply loloquwowndueo 10 hours agorootparentprevThere are no “network shares”. The typical way to store model data would be in a volume, which is basically local nvme storage. reply xena 2 hours agorootparentWellllllll, technically there is LSVD which would let you store model weights in S3. God that's a horrible idea. Blog time! reply bbkane 11 hours agorootparentprevI see the whisper transcription article. Is there an easy way to limit it to, say $100 worth of transcription a month and then stop till next month? I want to transcribe a bunch of speeches but I want to spread the cost over time reply IanCal 10 hours agorootparentProbably available elsewhere but you could setup an account with a monthly spend limit with openai and use their API until you hit errors. $100/mo is about 10 days of speeches a month, how much data do you have? edit - if the pricing seems reasonable, you can just limit how many minutes you send. AssemblyAI is another provider at about the same cost. reply bbkane 8 hours agorootparentThanks! Maybe 50hr of speeches. It's a hobby idea so I'll check these out when I get some time reply xena 2 hours agorootparentEmail xe@fly.io, I'm intrigued. reply andes314 11 hours agorootparentprevDo you offer some sort of keep_warm parameter that removes this latency (for a greater cost)? reply mrkurt 10 hours agorootparentYou control machine lifecycles. To scale down, you just set the appropriate restart policy, then exit(0). You can also opt to let our proxy stop machines for you, but the most granular option is to just do it in code. So yes, kind of. You just wait before you exit. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentSo just to confirm, for these workloads, it’d start a machine when the request comes in, and then shut it down immediately after the request is finished (with some 30-60s in between I suppose)? Is there some way to keep it up if additional requests are in the queue? Edit: Found my answer elsewhere (yes). reply nakovet 10 hours agoprevAbout Fly but not about the GPU announcement, I wish they had a S3 replacement, they suggest a GNU Affero project that is a dealbreaker for any business, needing to leave Fly to store user assets was a dealbreaker for us to use Fly on our next project, sad cause I love the simplicity, the value for money, the built in VPN. reply simonw 10 hours agoparentSounds like you might be interested in the Tigris preview: - https://www.tigrisdata.com/ - https://benhoyt.com/writings/flyio-and-tigris/ (discussed here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39360870) - https://fly.io/docs/reference/tigris/ reply JoshTriplett 10 hours agoparentprev> I wish they had a S3 replacement, they suggest a GNU Affero project that is a dealbreaker for any business AGPL does not mean you have to share everything you've built atop a service, just everything you've linked to it and any changes you've made to it.

Small/unproven apps that need to run some AI model, but won't/can't use hosted offerings by the literally dozens of race-to-zero startups offering OSS models? We run plenty of our own models and hardware, so I get wanting to have control over the metal. I'm just trying to figure out who this is targeted at. reply mrkurt 6 hours agoparentWe have some ideas but there's no clear answer yet. Probably people building hosting platforms. Maybe not obvious hosting platforms, but hosting platforms. reply dathinab 1 hour agoparentprevTL;DR: (skip to last paragraph) - having the GPU compute in the same data center or at least from the same cloud provider can be a huge plus - it's not that rare for various providers we have tried out to run out of available A100 GPUs, even with large providers we had issues like that multiple times (less an issue if you aren't locked to specific regions) - not all providers provide a usable scale down to zero \"on demand\" model, idk. how well it works with fly long term but that could be another point - race-to-zero startups have the tendency to not last, it's kind by design from a 100 of them just a very few survive - if you are already on fly and write a non-public tech demo which just gets evaluated a few times their GPU offering can act like a default don't think much about it solution (through you using e.g. Huggingface services would be often more likely) - A lot of companies can't run their own hardware for various reasons, at best they can rent a rack in another Datacenter but for small use use-cases this isn't always worth it. Similar there are use cases which do might A100s but only run them rarely (e.g. on weekly analytics data). Potentially less then 1h/w in which case race-to-zero pricing might not look interesting at all To sum up I think there are many small reasons why some companies, not just startups, might have interest in fly GPUs, especially if they are already on fly. But there is no single \"that's why\" argument, especially if you are already deploying to another cloud. reply KTibow 5 hours agoparentprevFly is an edge network - in theory, if your GPUs are next to your servers and your servers are next to your users, your app will be very fast, as highlighted in the article. In practice this might not matter much since inference takes a long time anyway. reply tptacek 4 hours agorootparentWe're really a couple things; the edge stuff was where we got started in 2020, but \"fast booting VMs\" is just as important to us now, and that's something that's useful whether or not you're doing edge stuff. reply joshxyz 4 hours agorootparentprevthis is crazy, this move alone cements fly as an edge player for the next 3 / 5 / 10 years. reply ec109685 4 hours agoprevThe recipe example or any any LLM use case seems like a very poor way of highlighting “inference at the edge” given the extra few hundred ms round trip won’t matter. reply manishsharan 4 hours agoparentThis.

You pick the OS image, and you get a root shell to play with. An RTX 4090 currently costs $0.50 per hour. It literally took me less than 15 minutes to sign up for the first time a few weeks ago. For comparison, the first time experience on Amazon EC2 is much worse. I had tried to get a GPU instance on EC2 but couldn't reserve it (cryptic error message). Then I realized as a first-time EC2 user my default quota simply doesn't allow any GPU instances. After contacting support and waiting 4-5 days I eventually got a response my quota was increased, but I still can't launch a GPU instance... apparently my quota is still zero. At this point I gave up and found vast.ai. I don't know if Amazon realizes how FRUSTRATING their useless default quotas are for first-time EC2 users. reply janalsncm 1 hour agorootparentPretty much had the same experience with EC2 GPUs. No permission, had to contact support. Got permission a day later. I wanted to run on A100 ($30/hour, 8GPU minimum) but they were out of them that night. I tried again next day, same thing. So I gave up and used RunPod.io. reply nojs 7 hours agoparentprevI can recommend runpod.io after a few months of usage - very easy to spin up different GPU configurations for testing and the pricing is simple and transparent. Using TheBloke docker images you can get most local models up and running in a few minutes. reply mrkurt 7 hours agoparentprevYou might actually be better off building a gaming rig and using that. The datacenter GPUs are silly expensive, because this is how NVIDIA price discriminates. The consumer, game GPUs work really well and you can buy them for almost as cheap as you can lease datacenter ones. reply leourbina 7 hours agoparentprevPaperspace is a great way to go for this. You can start by just using their notebook product (similar to Collab), and you get to pick which type of machine/GPU it runs on.

So about 1/3 the price. You can even get H100s for cheaper than these prices at $2.24 an hour. So these do seem a bit expensive, but this might be because there is high demand for them from customers and they don't have the supply. reply treesciencebot 10 hours agorootparentJust to correct the record, both $1.15 per A100 and $2.24 per H100 require a 3-year-commitment.

If it is fast this could be pretty interesting reply amanda99 10 hours agoparentI think the bigger question is how long it takes to load any meaningful model onto the GPU. reply fideloper 10 hours agorootparentthat’s exactly right. gpu-friendly base images tend to be larger (1-3g+) so that takes time (30s - 2m range) to create a new Machine (vm). Then there’s “spin up time” of your software - downloading model files adds as long as it takes to download GB of model files. Models (and pip dependencies!) can generally be “cached” if you (re)use volumes. Attaching volumes to gpu machines dynamically created via the API takes a bit of management on your end (in that you’d need to keep track of your volumes, what region they’re in, and what to do if you need more volumes than you have) reply dathinab 33 minutes agorootparentI know it's not common in research and makes often little sense there. But at least in theory for deployments you should generate deployment images. I.e. no pip included in the image(!), all dependencies preloaded, unnecessary parts stripped, etc. Models likely might also be bundled, but not always. Still large images, but also depending on what they are for the same image might be reused often so it can be cached by the provider to some degree. reply dcsan 9 hours agoprevCan fly run cog files like replicate uses?

    "originLink": "https://blog.jgc.org/2024/02/the-original-www-proposal-is-word-for.html",
    "originBody": "John Graham-Cumming's blog 2024-02-13 The original WWW proposal is a Word for Macintosh 4.0 file from 1990, can we open it? The W3C has a page with the original WWW proposal from Tim Berners-Lee. One of the downloads says The original document file (I think - I can't test it) The \"I can't test it\" made me sad. There are two other files (an RTF version and an HTML version generated in 1998 from the original file). But can we open the original document? The original document is 68,608 bytes and file on my Mac says it's a Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0 file. That matches with TBL's note on the W3C page saying: \"A hand conversion to HTML of the original MacWord (or Word for Mac?) document written in March 1989 and later redistributed unchanged apart from the date added in May 1990.\" Microsoft Office for Mac came out in 1989 with System 6.0. That was Microsoft Word 4.0 so we're looking for compatibility with Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0. Let's see what modern software can open this. What I really want to be able to do is open it and convert it to, say, PDF with high fidelity. Microsoft Word Let's begin with Microsoft Word itself. I uploaded the file to Microsoft OneDrive with the extension .doc and clicked on it to open it in Microsoft Word. Apple Pages I switched to the Mac and hoped that Apple Pages might understand an old Microsoft Word for Macintosh file. No such luck. Apache OpenOffice Next let's hope open source software will come to the rescue. I downloaded the latest Apache OpenOffice and it did open the file but the formatting is gone and the diagrams are missing. LibreOffice OK, maybe I need different open source software, so I switched to the latest LibreOffice and it opened it. And the diagrams are crisp! Although there's something weird about the margins and there are other formatting problems. CERN PDF CERN makes available a PDF version of the proposal which was apparently created in 1998 using Acrobat Distiller Daemon 2.1 for SunOS/Solaris (SPARC). It has 20 pages. The LibreOffice imported version has 24 pages. To get an overview of what's different I created a PDF from the LibreOffice version and then looked at it and the CERN PDF in the contact sheet version in Apple Preview. Here's the CERN PDF: Here's the LibreOffice-generated PDF: Things that are different: 1. The right-hand margin is missing in the LibreOffice version. 2. The LibreOffice version is using 14 pt vs. 12 pt for most of the text. 3. The LibreOffice version has turned headers with TBL's initials in them into footers. 4. The page breaks look in the right places (see how the images are correctly placed towards the end); thus it's probably the font size that's the biggest problem. 5. There CERN PDF has a space under the heading and the LibreOffice version does not. Emulation To make sure that I knew what the actual original document looked like I decided to use Infinite Mac to boot a 1990-era Macintosh and run actual Word for Macintosh 4.0 on the original document. That way I can see actual fonts, font sizes and layout to confirm how the document should have looked. And that's where it became obvious that the original document on the original Mac and the CERN PDF are quite different. The CERN PDF has 20 pages. On the Mac running Word for Macintosh 4.0 with A4 paper it has 22 pages. So I decided to aim to get us close to the original document on the Mac. So... set to A4 paper and set right margin to same size as left margin. Change the first page format to be different since it doesn't have the same gutters, footers or headers. Manually change the body text from 14 pt (and other sizes) to 12 pt. Manually deal with text that breaks across pages incorrectly and other alignment problems. Fix the footer that should be a header. In the end I got pretty close to what's visible on the Mac. Conclusion Converting this document from its original format was a bit of a victory for open source software. And a lesson in how hard document preservation is. To help preserve it a bit, and in an open format, I've uploaded my .odt version to GitHub here. It's interesting, and a little disheartening to see that this 34 year old document is difficult to open, and even when opened the resulting output isn't exactly the same as the original. PS If you're wondering why I ever started this project. I just wanted a high quality version of the diagrams in the original proposal for a presentation. Took me a lot longer than I thought it would. PPS A comment on Hacker News pointed out that I could probably either create a PostScript file or a PDF via an emulated Mac. I was able to boot another Mac (System 7) that had Word from 1992 and Print2PDF (a driver that creates a printer that makes a PDF file) and print directly from Word for Macintosh 5.1a. I've added the generated PDF file to the GitHub. This version has 20 pages and the fonts are different but it does meet my original requirement of a PDF. PPPS A Hacker News comment links to another conversion done using different versions of Word and bit of fiddling around to get a really nice version of the document in modern formats. at February 13, 2024 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: pseudo-randomness 10 comments: matt said...

It's pretty unsurprising that Apache OpenOffice has trouble, given that that fork of what used to be StarOffice has been dead more or less since it joined Apache (and since long before it left the incubator), and hasn't managed even critical security releases for many years: indeed this state of total deadness is why LibreOffice exists. They literally don't even have anyone left \"working\" on the zombie project who knows how to build it any more. All it has is the name. It's a scandal that it's still there, misleading people into using something more than half a decade dead, and not redirecting people straight to LibreOffice. (The fact that in more than half a decade they have neither done any releases nor retired the project nor even done the much simpler job of simply *redirecting people to the project that is still alive* despite many people begging them to says everything you need to know about the bad faith of the remaining \"contributors\". They appear to see OpenOffice purely as a thing to let them say on their CVs that they are on an Apache PMC. If it was finally retired they wouldn't be able to do that.) 4:14 PM stuaxo said... This is great. It would be good to have a couple of upstream bugs in libreoffice to fix the remaining formatting issues, the document itself probably works as a test case. 4:23 PM tgegrteg said...

(jgc.org)433 points by jgrahamc 19 hours agohidepastfavorite183 comments jasomill 11 hours agoFor anyone interested, here's the document in modern Word format, with all vector artwork and fonts intact: https://jasomill.at/proposal.docx To convert it, I first opened and re-saved using Word 98[1] running on a QEMU-emulated Power Mac, at which point it opened in modern Word for Mac (viz., version 16.82). The pictures were missing, however, with Word claiming \"There is not enough memory or disk space to display or print the picture.\" (given 64 GB RAM with 30+ GB free at the time, I assume the actual problem is that Word no longer supports the PICT image format). To restore the images, I used Acrobat (5.0.10) print-to-PDF in Word 98 to create a PDF, then extracted the three images to separate PDFs using (modern) Adobe Illustrator, preserving the original fonts, vector artwork, size, and exact bounding box of each image. At this point, restoring the images was a simple matter of deleting the original images and dragging and dropping the PDF replacements from the Finder. For comparison, here's the PDF created by Acrobat from Word 98 on the Power Mac https://jasomill.at/proposal-Word98.pdf and here's a PDF created by modern Word running on macOS Sonoma https://jasomill.at/proposal-Word16.82.pdf [1] https://archive.org/details/ms-word98-special-edition reply whoopdedo 10 hours agoparentDid you attempt to extract the pictures so they could be converted directly by another program? Archive Team says that LibreOffice can read vector PICT files[1]. And then saved as SVG. Of course you still have the font problem if it has text. I hadn't thought of using PDF to preserve vectors, but of course it does, as well as embedding the fonts. [1] http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/PICT reply jasomill 8 hours agorootparentGood question. I saved the original document as RTF and extracted what I believe is the raw PICT binary data, but quickly decided on the Acrobat route when I realized I didn't know of any software that could easily convert PICT to a more modern vector format (other than by printing the PICT to Acrobat PDF, but that's essentially what I did in Word with extra steps). If you want to give it a go, here's the raw PICT data from the RTF: https://jasomill.at/Picture1.PICT (extracted from RTF tag \\pict\\macpict\\picw513\\pich459) https://jasomill.at/Picture2.PICT (\\pict\\macpict\\picw410\\pich327) https://jasomill.at/Picture3.PICT (\\pict\\macpict\\picw420\\pich291) and here are MacBinary-encoded[1] PICT files containing the same data: https://jasomill.at/Picture1.bin https://jasomill.at/Picture2.bin https://jasomill.at/Picture3.bin [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBinary Encoding is required because the PICT file format stores image data in the file's resource fork[2].

Thank you! reply whoopdedo 18 hours agoprev> That way I can see actual fonts, font sizes and layout to confirm how the document should have looked. Or you would if you had the original fonts. Word 4.0 was released for System 6 with support as far back as System 3.2. Fonts at that time had separate screen and printer files for the different output resolutions. If you're missing the printer font it'll print a scaled (using nearest-neighbor) rendering of the screen font. If you're missing the screen font it'll substitute the system font. (Geneva by default, as seen in the screenshot.) In this case, only the well-known Palatino and Courier typefaces are needed. But LibreOffice substituted Times New Roman even though I have Palatino Linotype installed. reply jasomill 10 hours agoparentThis is probably because the (internal) name of Palatino Linotype is \"PalatinoLinotype\" (for the version shipped with Windows) or \"PalatinoLTStd\" (for the Adobe OpenType version). In the absence of a hard-coded special case, font matching based on common prefixes could easily match something inappropriate, such as — taking the first example I see on my machine — mapping \"Lucida\" to \"LucidaConsole\", when almost any proportional sans-serif font would arguably be a better match for the document author's design intent. Then again, even exact name matches provide no guarantees. For example, Apple has shipped two fonts (internally) named NewYork: the TrueType conversion of Susan Kare's 1983 bitmap design for the original Macintosh, and an unrelated design released in 2019. reply whoopdedo 10 hours agorootparentIt's more that I half-expected well-known mappings to be baked in. Like \"Times\" -> \"Times New Roman\". Didn't they also name one of their new fonts \"SanFrancisco\" much to the ire of Susan Kare fans. reply jasomill 7 hours agorootparentYes, but the current OpenType San Francisco fonts use \"SF\" in their (display and internal) names, so no naming conflict exists with the original \"ransom note\" bitmap font. Also, as far as I know, of the original Mac fonts, Apple only ever shipped TrueType versions of Chicago, Geneva, Monaco, and New York. And I'm not aware of any OS with native support for both OpenType and classic Mac bitmap fonts (conversions are always possible, of course). reply jgrahamc 17 hours agoparentprevThat may go some way to explaining some of the differences I see, but the main thing I was looking for in the emulation was the font sizes. reply aidenn0 15 hours agorootparentDoesn't the font matter almost as much as the font-size setting for font sizes, given that different font families can have wildly different metrics at the same font size? reply jgrahamc 14 hours agorootparentI bet it does. I should redo the final part after installing the required fonts. reply peter_hansteen 8 minutes agoprevThis reminds me of my own screed of a much simpler document (an ASCII table generated as a printer test back in the late 1980s) that was not possible to render correctly some years later - https://bsdly.blogspot.com/2013/11/compatibility-is-hard-cha... - also contains a link to a further rant about other document formats that were supposed to be \"standard\" and \"portable\". reply noufalibrahim 15 hours agoprevOne underappreciated (though mentioned) hero in this little saga is the venerable file(1) command. proposal: Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0 It's so incredibly useful and so easily overlooked.

Not sure just curious not even sure where to look that one up honestly. reply zokier 12 hours agorootparentDigging through the files a bit I think the images are in PICT format which is very specific to Macs (the original ones). Its not surprising that modern Word doesn't support those that well as they are actually somewhat complicated kinda-vector image format. I am surprised that even Word 2003 implemented PICT on Windows. reply ogurechny 8 hours agorootparentIt's not “kinda-vector”, it's a metafile format for QuickDraw operations (Windows did the same later with WMF, which was a list of GDI operations). http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/PICT Imagemagick supports it. What's more important, QuickDraw source is available, so not only we can have “some” conversion, we can also reason about its correctness (to some extent — according to comments, it's from 1982-1985). https://computerhistory.org/blog/macpaint-and-quickdraw-sour... Extracting raw embedded PICT files from the document and working with them would be the best way to get proper charts. To see what appeared on paper, we can direct emulated system output to an emulated printer, or capture the PostScript commands and rasterize them at the resolution that was used by device available to the author. It is well known that Word for Windows stored last used printer settings in the document, so it could be the same for files produced by Mac version. (M-hm, it says “Laserwriter” at 0x10097. Maybe they all do.) Because Microsoft made the most popular document editor for both Windows and Mac, they had to deal with interoperability of two versions of their own software. Supporting WMF/EMF on Mac meant they had to drag GDI implementation along with Office (luckily, the reference could be grabbed from their colleagues). Supporting PICT on Windows meant they had to re-implement QuickDraw primitives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Word https://news.microsoft.com/1999/04/26/office-98-built-for-th... It is totally possible that Office applications used built-in PICT parser even on Mac to make things simple, and not rely on 15 years of compatibility layers in the system. reply zokier 11 hours agorootparentprevProbably the completely best would be to use LO for the images and Word otherwise... needs some manual twiddling but I suspect that way you can get pretty much perfect layout and images. reply ogurechny 11 hours agorootparentprevOffice applications up to (and probably including) version 2010 break and crash on latest Windows versions.

It was a design choice to turn documents of mostly text into obscure binary formats that were badly standardized and maintained. reply resters 12 hours agorootparentNot true at all. Some of Microsoft's best minds created extremely ingenious methods that allowed early word processors to be usable on files that were dramatically larger than what would fit in memory. OSes didn't support suitable performance via VM infrastructure at the time. It was clever, outside of the box thinking that got MS to be able to beat WordPerfect (a worthy competitor) and the many other also-rans. There was (contrary to popular belief) not a deliberate strategy to limit interoperability. It was simply the reality of the approaches utilized that made them tightly coupled to the MS Word codebase and less standardizable than would have otherwise been ideal.

You can't afford an elaborate parser in such limited memory, or you'd have to swap out its implementation on floppy on every load and save. Just running the parser would have slowed down document loading significantly. The floppy disk capacity also wasn't much larger. You already had to swap the disks for doing spell checking or similar.

Based on the error message, hypothetically I suppose you could even make a custom filter to handle the object. But this really goes more into the facet of Office files that allowed embedding pretty much anything into them, and relying on this \"filter\" system (I guess OLE) to handle embedded objects. So while the DOC file itself is getting parsed and rendered pretty much perfectly, the embedded objects are another story. In the same sense I'd say browser might open some HTML page \"fine\" even if it doesn't know how to handle some image format that is used on the page; it'd still handles the HTML correctly. reply petersmagnusson 14 hours agorootparentif you read the blog, the main point of OP’s project was to get at the diagrams, so hardly “splitting hairs”. reply jdofaz 15 hours agorootparentprevMakes me wonder if the graphics are in PICT format reply zokier 12 hours agorootparentI think they are.

Of course, it depends on the data… And there are companies backing up whole virtual machines with infinite retention, believing to be able to run them: it is hard enough to restore a vSphere 5.x machine on a brand new vSphere 8, I really don't understand this waste of space. reply rvnx 13 hours agoparentIf you backup all, you can sort later, and even eventually never.

At this price it's not worth sorting, when one single devops costs 100 USD+ per hour, not including the opportunity cost of not working on something more productive (and less boring for the developer). Then X years after the company is acquired, or sufficient time has lapsed, you can delete / drop the data without sorting. Regarding virtual machines, if it's VMDK for example, you can read the raw disks without booting it, and again, it's not worth taking a risk to lose data to potentially save 10 USD per month, which is similar to one developer taking one beer extra at a team event. reply scaglio 1 hour agorootparent> if it's VMDK for example, you can read the raw disks without booting it Yes, but that's the difference between \"readable\" and \"usable\".

I believe there was an official converter tool Microsoft provided as a free add-on or an optional install component -- it wouldn't open the \"ancient\" Word formats otherwise. There's definitely going to be a chain here of 1 or 2 intermediate versions of Word that should be able to open the document perfectly and get it into a modern Word format, I should think -- and I'm curious what the exact versions are. (Although as other people point out, if you don't need to edit it, then exporting it as PostScript in Word 4.0 and converting it to PDF works fine too.) reply jasomill 10 hours agoparentAs I've discovered while playing with this document and reading this thread: Current Word for Mac blocks opening the file under discussion, with no obvious workarounds. Current Word for Windows will only open the file with non-default security settings, and won't render the images at all. Per Microsoft, PICT image support was removed from all versions of Word for Windows in August 2019[1]. The current version of Word for Mac fails to render the images with a misleading error message (\"There is not enough memory or disk space to display or print the picture.\"). As for fonts, they should render fine assuming you have matching fonts, where \"matching\" is defined by some application- or OS-specific algorithm, e.g., a post above indicates LibreOffice (on Linux?) substituting Times New Roman for Palatino when Palatino Linotype was avilable, whereas current Word on Windows 11 has no problem rendering Palatino as Palatino, presumably using the copy of Palatino Linotype installed with the OS. Finally, if matching spacing (character, word, and line), line breaks, and page breaks is important, you should definitely open the document using as close a version of Word as possible with the exact fonts used when creating the document installed. Oh, and hope the original author didn't rely on printer fonts without matching scalable screen fonts available, or else you're probably SOL unless your goal is printing to a sufficiently similar printer.

Apparently the language was weird enough that supporting it made some (in)security hacks possible. I guess I'm old ! I remember first finding out about it in 1986 when is very \"leet\". Postscript printers were big $. I say tragically because Postscript was pretty key in making DTP as compelling as it used to be, which kind of saved the Mac in terms of being the \"killer app\" for it. I think you may be able to run some kind of postscript support in some tool from Adobe, or even Ghostscript.

The embedded images are in PICT format, and TrueType versions of the three fonts used (Courier, Helvetica, and Palatino) have shipped with all versions of the Mac OS since System 7 in 1991. And while Word 4.0 shipped in 1989, so did Adobe Type Manager[2], which supported Type 1 fonts onscreen and on non-PostScript printers, though to get a Type 1 version of Palatino for ATM at that time you'd have also needed the Adobe Plus Pack[3] (or possibly acquiring Palatino by other means; I don't recall when Adobe started selling individual fonts and the Font Folio).

Digital documents are otherwise easy to preserve indefinitely, if care is taken up-front to choose a simple document format that is likely to remain parseable (or at least documented) for a long time. And even when you don't do that, there's always the possibility of writing a parser later (assuming documentation is around) or reverse-engineering the format.

Paper records that old only exist in Egypt. > Digital documents are otherwise easy to preserve indefinitely, if care is taken up-front to choose a simple document format that is likely to remain parseable (or at least documented) for a long time. This isn't a good match to the example either; Ancient Near Eastern records had to be deciphered. (The Semitic ones had to be deciphered. The Sumerian ones benefited from surviving documentation, but we had to find that and learn how to read it.) The original example isn't particularly apt; reading this 30-year-old file, or a similar one, is a task that one guy can do in less than a week using existing tools and know that he's done it correctly.

Some of the information in this post was previously covered right here in the comments on HN a few years back:The top reply there links to an online file(1)-like tool that identified it as a MacWrite II document. Last time I checked, the tool was updated and identifies the file as \"Word for the Macintosh document (v4.0)\" (pretty much what my system's file(1) says about it). We actually have a scan of Robert Cailliau's copy with his handwritten notes (including the infamous, \"Vague but exciting...\" remark). It's neither 20 nor 24 pages but instead 16 and differs in several respects: ; the version linked in the post and described erroneously as \"the original\" on w3.org clearly isn't the original and has been changed in several ways besides just \"the date added in May 1990\". Rather, the May 1990 version here is the second revision of the original that was first passed to Cailliau, and by November 1990 Berners-Lee and Cailliau were calling this second revision \"HyperText and CERN\"[1][2]. That is, \"Information Management: A Proposal\" is the one authored solely by TBL and given to Cailliau. It's not the version that appears here. \"HyperText and CERN\" from May 1990 is what we're looking at here, but was mistakenly also published as \"Information Management: A Proposal\". Later, TBL and Cailliau coauthored a joint work called \"WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a Hypertext Project\"[1][3] that referenced \"HyperText and CERN\" by name. TBL is also known to have used WriteNow—there are lots of .wn files littering w3.org. I now believe (since last summer) that it's likely that TBL authored this revision of the proposal in WriteNow (even if he didn't save it in the WriteNow format) or used WriteNow at least for the RTF export.

And yes, I do expect it to be better - GPT4 isn't perfect but I don't really it ever hallucinating quite that hard. In fact, its answer was basically that it didn't know. And when I asked it questions with other, much less esoteric code like \"how would you refactor this to be more idiomatic?\" I'd get either \"I couldn't complete your request. Rephrase your prompt and try again.\" or \"Sorry, I can't help with that because there's too much data. Try again with less data.\" GPT-4 was helpful in both cases. reply peddling-brink 2 hours agorootparentMy experience has been that gpt4 will happily hallucinate the details when I go too deep.

I'm not particularly interested in having it outright program for me (other than say to sketch how to do something as inspiration, which I'll rewrite rather than copy) because I think typically I'd want to do it a certain way and it would take far longer to NLP an LLM to write it in whatever syntax than to WhateverSyntaxProgram it myself. reply remus 1 hour agoparentprev> Frankly, OpenAI seems to be losing its luster, and fast.

Karpathy has truly revitalized the AI field, which is often cluttered with overly complex and dense mathematical descriptions. Take CS 231, for example, which stands as one of Stanford's most popular AI/ML courses. Think about the number of students who have taken this class from around 2015 to 2017 and have since advanced in AI. It's fair to say a good chunk of credit goes back to that course. Instructors who break it down, showing you how straightforward it can be, guiding you through each step, are invaluable. They play a crucial role in lowering the entry barriers into the field. In the long haul, it's these newcomers, brought into AI by resources like those created by Karpathy, who will drive some of the most significant breakthroughs.

And I sorta believe them! reply zingelshuher 3 hours agoprevOMG, what do we do now!? But seriously, right now with full attention to LLMs, and many brains, there is no single key person. The question 'who said it first' isn't that important for the progress. With experts leaving OpenAI will gradually loose it's leadership. Others will catch up. Which is good in general, no one should have monopoly on AI. I wish it was that easy with hardware too... reply sva_ 4 hours agoprevSounds like he wants to focus on teaching. reply rvz 5 hours agoprevLooking at the thread, it is quite amusing to see some founders hopelessly begging Karpathy to work at their tiny startup to realize that they can't afford him as he is exceptionally brilliant in the AI industry. If OpenAI, Tesla and Google cannot retain him, then probably nobody can. Probably he'll be doing YouTube videos all day long. reply PheonixPharts 5 hours agoparentI think money is the least of the reasons why those founders wouldn't attract him. To attract someone at Karpathy's level you would need a project that is both wildly challenging (and yet not the typical startup \"challenging\" because it's a poorly thought out idea) and requires the kind of resources (compute, data, human brains in vats, etc) that would make your place look far more interesting than OpenAI. But, hardest of all, you would need startup founders that could tame their egos enough to let someone like Karpathy shine. I haven't talked to a Bay area startup founder in a while who wouldn't completely squander that kind of talent by attempting to force their own half-baked ideas on him, and then try to force him out months later when he couldn't ship those poorly thought out products citing lack of \"leadership\". reply stephenw310 5 hours agoprevKarpathy quits his job to become a full-time AI Youtuber.

Here's a proposal. Send $500M to NVIDIA for GPUs. Send $100M to AMD to balance the odds. Spend $100M to build a new chip as a hail mary. Spend the rest on $10M comp packages. How close did I get? reply zxexz 1 hour agorootparentSeems pretty reasonable! Not sure that's the easiest path for them to maximize profit though. I'd probably say they should: - allocate the $500M to the new chip, $100M to each of AMD and NVIDIA, then: - never officially hire any more staff (these founders are 10E6X devs!) - start \"subtly\" liquidating the AMD and NVIDIA chips after a year (\"IlPathAI are liquidating their GPUs? >I bought a used GH200 off eBay and the shipping label was covering up previous shipping label for Andrej's shipping container treehouse >Are they getting quick cash to finance their foundry run on the new chips? It's that good??\"). - Release a vague \"alignment\" solution on a chatgpt-generated kickstarter clone, take 3 years to \"develop\" it. - Raise a series A (maybe a pre-A, or a post-seed. Honestly, maybe even a re-seed with this valuation!) off the hype (some obviously stable diffusion-generated images help here). - Sell 30% of their shares in a secondary, profit some billions. - When everyone starts getting suspicious, time to take out those GH200s you \"sold\" on ebay out of storage (those buyers were just sockpuppets - investors from the family/\"friends\" round), repackage them in some angled magnesium alloy. Release them to great fanfare. Crowd briefly ecstatic, concern sets in - \"this has the same performance as the GH200? That was like 4 years ago!\". - Call the \"performance issues\" some form of \"early access syndrome\" and succeed in shifting blame back onto the consumer. - Release a \"performance patch\" that in actuality just freaking overclocks and overvolts the device, occasionally secretly training on the user's validation set using an RDMA exfiltration exploit. This gets them to 2028, when the modified firmware on all devices spontaneously causes a meltdown - should've written it in Rust - that should've been a signed int! The fans thought it was suddenly 1773, ran in reverse so fast the whole device melted (aww all that IP down the drain)! - When asked how on earth that could make any sense, dodge the question with the news that \"We just had the unfortunate news that one of the greybeards who wrote the firmware previously at Siemens and then the DoE, has programmed his last PLC. He died glowing peacefully last night surrounded by layered densities of gasses. We are too sad and bankrupt to go on.\" - Declare bankruptcy - Become alt-right pundits on Y.com (If they haven't already wrapped around to AA.com - they managed to grab that domain after some airline went bankrupt after an embarrassing incident involving a 787 Max, the latest Stable Diffusion model, a marketing executive, some loose screws, and a Boeing QA contractor back there who might Not Be Real). - Start a war with a \"totally harmless\" post, later admit it was \"poorly worded\". - Use some saved funds to \"find a way\" for IlPathAI, Inc. to leave bankruptcy, pivot to a chat app (you actually just buy HipChat again). Resell that after reusing it for a few particularly juicy govt. tenders. Pivot to defense contracting. End up with enough money for the rest of the millennium. - Write a joint autobiography called \"The Alignment Problem\", send it to your \"kickstarter\" backers. Print the book using old school metal typecasting because they forgot TeX, and the current language models only spit out hallucinated Marvel dialog. Screw up the kerning since you learned typesetting on the TikTok page of a French clockwork museum. Claim this was on purpose. - The whole time, maintain an amazingly educational YouTube channel teaching Machine Learning to those who love to learn. - Release \"AGI\" but it's actually just 5 lines of PyTorch that would have solved Tesla's FSD problems with mirrors. Send Douglas Hofstadter a very slightly smaller copy every day until he recurses into true AGI. --- Well I started out serious at least (OK, only the first and second-to-last bullets were). I do genuinely believe that $100M would not be enough to produce competitive IP right now - You'd likely have to budget a majority of that to the final production run! I wonder how much you'd have to spend on making custom chips to break even with spending the money on research in the performance/model architecture side of things, on average. reply utopcell 7 hours agoprevWhere is he going ? reply peacebreaker2k 4 hours agoprevis it a boy? or a girl? reply peacebreaker2k 4 hours agoparent(and congrats!) reply renewiltord 5 hours agoprevNice. 1 year cliff bounce.

I seriously don't know why. Stereo vision gives pretty crappy depth, ask anyone who has been playing around with disparity mapping. Modern machine vision requires just one camera for depth.

You’re in control of ChatGPT’s memory. February 13, 2024 Authors OpenAI Product, Announcements We’re testing memory with ChatGPT. Remembering things you discuss across all chats saves you from having to repeat information and makes future conversations more helpful. You're in control of ChatGPT's memory. You can explicitly tell it to remember something, ask it what it remembers, and tell it to forget conversationally or through settings. You can also turn it off entirely. We are rolling out to a small portion of ChatGPT free and Plus users this week to learn how useful it is. We will share plans for broader roll out soon. How memory works As you chat with ChatGPT, you can ask it to remember something specific or let it pick up details itself. ChatGPT’s memory will get better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements over time. For example: You’ve explained that you prefer meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way. You’ve told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows where to start. You mention that you have a toddler and that she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. As a kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create lesson plans. You’re in control You can turn off memory at any time (Settings > Personalization > Memory). While memory is off, you won't create or use memories. If you want ChatGPT to forget something, just tell it. You can also view and delete specific memories or clear all memories in settings (Settings > Personalization > Manage Memory). ChatGPT's memories evolve with your interactions and aren't linked to specific conversations. Deleting a chat doesn't erase its memories; you must delete the memory itself. You can find more details in our Help Center. We may use content that you provide to ChatGPT, including memories, to improve our models for everyone. If you’d like, you can turn this off through your Data Controls. As always, we won't train on content from ChatGPT Team and Enterprise customers. Learn more about how we use content to train our models and your choices in our Help Center. Use temporary chat for conversations without memory If you’d like to have a conversation without using memory, use temporary chat. Temporary chats won't appear in history, won't use memory, and won't be used to train our models. Learn more about temporary chats in our Help Center. Custom instructions also allow ChatGPT to be more helpful Custom Instructions continue to allow you to provide ChatGPT with direct guidance on what you’d like it to know about you and how you’d like it to respond. For explicit information or instructions, you can add it to your Custom Instructions. For information shared via conversations, ChatGPT can remember relevant details for you. Evolving our privacy and safety standards Memory brings additional privacy and safety considerations, such as what type of information should be remembered and how it’s used. We’re taking steps to assess and mitigate biases, and steer ChatGPT away from proactively remembering sensitive information, like your health details - unless you explicitly ask it to. Team and Enterprises customers can work more efficiently For Enterprise and Team users, memory can be useful when using ChatGPT for work. It can learn your style and preferences, and build upon past interactions. This saves you time and leads to more relevant and insightful responses. For example: ChatGPT can remember your tone, voice, and format preferences, and automatically apply them to blog post drafts without needing repetition. When coding, you tell ChatGPT your programming language and frameworks. It can remember these preferences for subsequent tasks, streamlining the process. For monthly business reviews, you securely upload your data to ChatGPT and it creates your preferred charts with three takeaways each. As with any ChatGPT feature, you’re in control of your organization’s data. Memories and any other information on your workspace are excluded from training our models. Users have control on how and when their memories are used in chats. In addition, Enterprise account owners can turn memory off for their organization at any time. Enterprise and Team users will have access to memory as part of our wider rollout. GPTs will also have memory GPTs will have their own distinct memory. Builders will have the option to enable memory for their GPTs. Like your chats, memories are not shared with builders. To interact with a memory-enabled GPT, you will also need to have memory on. For example: The Books GPT helps you find your next read. With memory enabled, it remembers your preferences, such as favorite genres or top books, and tailors recommendations accordingly, without needing repeated inputs. Each GPT has its own memory, so you might need to repeat details you’ve previously shared with ChatGPT. For example: If you're using the Artful Greeting Card GPT to create a birthday card for your daughter, it won’t know her age or that she loves jellyfish. You’ll need to tell it the relevant details. Memory for GPTs will be available when we roll it out more broadly.

I wanted to make two observations: 1. Yes, GPT-4 Turbo is quantitatively getting lazier at coding. I benchmarked the last 2 updates to GPT-4 Turbo, and it got lazier each time. 2. For coding, asking GPT-4 Turbo to emit code changes as unified diffs causes a 3X reduction in lazy coding. Here are some articles that discuss these topics in much more detail. https://aider.chat/docs/unified-diffs.html https://aider.chat/docs/benchmarks-0125.html reply CGamesPlay 9 hours agoparentI have not noticed any reduction in laziness with later generations, although I don't use ChatGPT in the same way that Aider does. I've had a lot of luck with using a chain-of-thought-style system prompt to get it to produce results. Here are a few cherry-picked conversations where I feel like it does a good job (including the system prompt). A common theme in the system prompts is that I say that this is an \"expert-to-expert\" conversation, which I found tends to make it include less generic explanatory content and be more willing to dive into the details. - System prompt 1: https://sharegpt.com/c/osmngsQ - System prompt 2: https://sharegpt.com/c/9jAIqHM - System prompt 3: https://sharegpt.com/c/cTIqAil Note: I had to nudge ChatGPT on this one. All of this is anecdotal, but perhaps this style of prompting would be useful to benchmark. reply emporas 11 hours agoparentprevLazy coding is a feature not a bug. My guess is that it breaks aider automation, but by analyzing the AST that wouldn't be a problem. My experience with lazy coding, is it omits the irrelevant code, and focuses on the relevant part. That's good! As a side note, i wrote a very simple small program to analyze Rust syntax, and single out functions and methods using the syn crate [1]. My purpose was exactly to make it ignore lazy-coded functions. [1]https://github.com/pramatias/replacefn/tree/master/src reply anotherpaulg 9 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you've been extremely lucky and only had GPT \"omit the irrelevant code\". That has not been my experience working intensively on this problem and evaluating numerous solutions through quantitative benchmarking. For example, GPT will do things like write a class with all the methods as simply stubs with comments describing their function. Your link appears to be ~100 lines of code that use rust's syntax parser to search rust source code for a function with a given name and count the number of AST tokens it contains. Your intuitions are correct, there are lots of ways that an AST can be useful for an AI coding tool. Aider makes extensive use of tree-sitter, in order to parse the ASTs of a ~dozen different languages [0]. But an AST parser seems unlikely to solve the problem of GPT being lazy and not writing the code you need. [0] https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html reply Benjaminsen 2 hours agorootparentReally great article. Interestingly I have found that using the function call output significantly improves the coding quality. However for now, I have not run re-tests for every new version. I guess I know what I will be doing today. This is an area I have spend a lot of time working on, would love to compare notes. reply emporas 8 hours agorootparentprev>For example, GPT will do things like write a class with all the methods as simply stubs with comments describing their function. The tool needs a way to guide it to be more effective. It is not exactly trivial to get good results. I have been using GPT for 3.5 years and the problem you describe never happens to me. I could share with you just from last week, 500 to 1000 prompts i used to generate code, but the prompts i used to write the replacefn, can be found here [1]. Maybe there are some tips that could help. [1] https://chat.openai.com/share/e0d2ab50-6a6b-4ee9-963a-066e18... reply anotherpaulg 7 hours agorootparentThe chat transcript you linked is full of GPT being lazy and writing \"todo\" comments instead of providing all the code: // Handle struct-specific logic here // Add more details about the struct if needed // Handle other item types if needed ...etc... It took >200 back-and-forth messages with ChatGPT to get it to ultimately write 84 lines of code? Sounds lazy to me. reply emporas 6 hours agorootparentOk it does happen, but not so frequently. You are right. But is this such a big problem? Like, you parse the response, and throw away the comment \"//implementation goes here\", throw away also the function/method/class/struct/enum it belongs to, and keep the functional code. I am trying to implement something exactly like aider, but specifically for Rust, parsing the LLM's response, filtering out blank functions etc. In Rust, filtering out blank functions is easy, in other languages it might be very hard. I haven't looked into tree-sitter, but getting a sense of Javascript code, Python and more, sounds pretty much a very difficult problem to solve. Even though i like when GPT compresses the answer and doesn't return a lot of code, other programs like Mixtral 8x7b, never compress it like GPT in my experience. If they are not lacking much than GPT4, maybe they are better for your use case. >It took >200 back-and-forth messages with ChatGPT to get it to ultimately write 84 lines of code? Sounds lazy to me. Hey Rust throws a lot of errors. We do not want humans go around and debug code, unless it is absolutely necessary, right? reply omalled 13 hours agoparentprevCan you say in one or two sentences what you mean by “lazy at coding” in this context? reply anotherpaulg 13 hours agorootparentShort answer: Rather than fully writing code, GPT-4 Turbo often inserts comments like \"... finish implementing function here ...\". I made a benchmark based on asking it to refactor code that provokes and quantifies that behavior. Longer answer: I found that I could provoke lazy coding by giving GPT-4 Turbo refactoring tasks, where I ask it to refactor a large method out of a large class. I analyzed 9 popular open source python repos and found 89 such methods that were conceptually easy to refactor, and built them into a benchmark [0]. GPT succeeds on this task if it can remove the method from its original class and add it to the top level of the file with appropriate changes to the size of the abstract syntax tree. By checking that the size of the AST hasn't changed much, we can infer that GPT didn't replace a bunch of code with a comment like \"... insert original method here...\". The benchmark also gathers other laziness metrics like counting the number of new comments that contain \"...\". These metrics correlate well with the AST size tests. [0] https://github.com/paul-gauthier/refactor-benchmark reply TaylorAlexander 12 hours agorootparentI have a bunch of code I need to refactor, and also write tests for. (I guess I should make the tests before the refactor). How do you do a refactor with GPT-4? Do you just dump the file in to the chat window? I also pay for github copilot, but not GPT-4. Can I use copilot for this? Any advice appreciated! reply rkuykendall-com 12 hours agorootparent> Do you just dump the file in to the chat window? Yes, along with what you want it to do. > I also pay for github copilot, but not GPT-4. Can I use copilot for this? Not that I know of. CoPilot is good at generating new code but can't change existing code. reply jjwiseman 11 hours agorootparentGitHub Copilot Chat (which is part of Copilot) can change existing code. The UI is that you select some code, then tell it what you want. It returns a diff that you can accept or reject. https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about... reply redblacktree 11 hours agorootparentprevCopilot will change existing code. (though I find it's often not very good at it) I frequently highlight a section of code that has an issue, press ctrl-i and type something like \"/fix SomeError: You did it wrong\" reply ShamelessC 8 hours agorootparentprevI use gpt4-turbo through the api many times a day for coding. I have encountered this behavior maybe once or twice period. It was never an issue that didn’t make sense as essentially the model summarizing and/or assuming some shared knowledge (that was indeed known to me). This, and people generally saying that chatGPT has been intentionally degraded, are just super strange for me. I believe it’s happening but it’s making me question my sanity. What am I doing to get decent outputs? Am I simply not as picky? I treat every conversion as though it needs to be vetted because it does regardless of how good the model is. I only trust output from the model that I am a subject matter expert on or in a closely adjacent field. Otherwise I treat it much like an internet comment - useful for surfacing curiosities but requires vetting. reply hackerlight 2 hours agorootparent> I use gpt4-turbo through the api many times a day for coding. Why this instead of GPT-4 through the web app? And how do you actually use it for coding, do you copy and paste your question into a python script, which then calls the OpenAI API and spits out the response? reply neongreen 2 hours agorootparentNot the op, but I also use it through API (specifically MacGPT). My initial justification was that I would save by only paying for what I use, instead of a flat $20/mo, but now it looks like I’m not even saving much. reply Me1000 13 hours agorootparentprevIt has a tendency to do: \"// ... the rest of your code goes here\" in it's responses, rather than writing it all out. reply asaddhamani 13 hours agorootparentIt's incredibly lazy. I've tried to coax it into returning the full code and it will claim to follow the instructions while regurgitating the same output you complained about. GPT-4 was great, GPT-4 Turbo first version was pretty terrible bordering on unusable, then they came out with the Turbo second version, which almost feels worse to me, though I haven't compared, but if someone comes claiming they fixed an issue, but you still see it, it will bias you to see it more.

I went into a long tangent about specifically that in this post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38782678 reply cl42 15 hours agoprevI love this idea and it leads me to a question for everyone here. I've done a bunch of user interviews of ChatGPT, Pi, Gemini, etc. users and find there are two common usage patterns: 1. \"Transactional\" where every chat is a separate question, sort of like a Google search... People don't expect memory or any continuity between chats. 2. \"Relationship-driven\" where people chat with the LLM as if it's a friend or colleague. In this case, memory is critical. I'm quite excited to see how OpenAI (and others) blend usage features between #1 and #2, as in many ways, these can require different user flows. So HN -- how do you use these bots? And how does memory resonate, as a result? reply Crespyl 15 hours agoparentPersonally, I always expect every \"conversation\" to be starting from a blank slate, and I'm not sure I'd want it any other way unless I can self-host the whole thing. Starting clean also has the benefit of knowing the prompt/history is in a clean/\"known-good\" state, and that there's nothing in the memory that's going to cause the LLM to get weird on me. reply madamelic 13 hours agorootparentMemory would be much more useful on a project or topic basis.

This matters a lot for prompt injection/hijacking. Not that I'm clamoring to give OpenAI access to my personal files or APIs in the first place, but I'm definitely not interested in giving a version of GPT with more persistent memory access to those files or APIs.

It's not enough of a mitigating feature, but it helps a bit. reply mark_l_watson 14 hours agorootparentprevI have thought of implementing something like you are describing using local LLMs. Chunk the text of all conversations, use an embeddings data store for search, and for each new conversation calculate an embedding for the new prompt, add context text from previous conversations.

Each context would contain sub contexts. For example maybe I'm looking for career advice and I start out a chat with details of my job history, then im looking for a job and i paste in my cv, then im applying for a specific job and i paste in the job description. It would be nice to easily navigate to the career+cv+specific job description and start a new chat with 'whats missing from my cv that i should highlight for this job'. I find that I ask a mix of one of questions and questions that require a lot of refinement, and the latter get buried among the former when i try and find them again, so i end up re explaining myself in new chats. reply polygamous_bat 14 hours agorootparentI think it’s less of a 2D structure and more of a tree structure that you are describing.

Mostly of the \"I need a program/script/command line that does X\". Some memory might actually be helpful. For example having it know that I have a Mac will give me Mac specific answers to command line questions without me having to add \"for the Mac\" to my prompt. Or having it know that I prefer python it will give coding answers in Python. But in all those cases it takes me just a few characters to express that context with each request, and to be honest, I'll probably do it anyway even with memory, because it's habit at this point. reply c2lsZW50 12 hours agorootparentFor what you described the reply hobofan 15 hours agoparentprevMy main usage of ChatGPT/Phind is for work-transactional things. For those cases there are quite a few things that I'd like it to memorize, like programming library preferences (\"When working with dates prefer `date-fns` over `moment.js`\") or code style preferences (\"When writing a React component, prefer function components over class components\"). Currently I feed in those preferences via the custom instructions feature, but I rarely take some time to update them, so the memory future is a welcome addition here. reply glenstein 14 hours agoparentprevI think this is an extremely helpful distinction, because it disentangles a couple of things I could not clearly disentangle in my own. I think I am, and perhaps most people are, firmly transactional. And I think, in the interests of perusing \"stickiness\" unique to OpenAI, they are attempting to add relationship-driven/sticky bells and whistles, even though those pull the user interface as a whole toward a set of assumptions about usage that don't apply to me. reply snoman 14 hours agoparentprevFor me it’s a combination of transactional and topical.

On one hand, having long term memory seems an obviously necessary feature, which can potentially unlock a wide variety of use cases - companionship, more convenience and hopefully provide more personalized responses. Sometimes I find it too inconvenient to share full context (e.g. I won't share my entire social relationship before asking advice about how to communicate with my manager). However, I wonder to what degree this is a strategic move to build the moat by increasing switch cost. Pi is a great example with memory, but I often find this feature boring as 90% of my tasks are transactional. In fact, in many cases I want AI to surprise me with creative ideas I would never come up with. I would purposely make my prompt vague to get different perspectives. With that being said, I think being able to switch between these 2 mode with temporary chat is a good middle ground so long as it's easy to toggle. But I'll play with it for a while and see if temporary chat becomes my default. reply bearjaws 14 hours agoprevThis week in: How many ways will OpenAI rebrand tuning their system prompt. reply apetresc 12 hours agoparentI mean, this is almost certainly implemented as RAG, not stuffing the system prompt with every \"memory\", right? reply monkhood 1 hour agoprevI never felt comfortable sharing personal stuff with ChatGPT, now that it has memory it's even more creepy.

You could probably have an offline LLM that scans each of these memories one by one (or in chunks) and determine whether it could create such issues, and then delete them in a targeted way. reply atleastoptimal 5 hours agoprevI use chatGPT much more often as a generalized oracle than a personalized answer machine. The context id prefer it has varies much more between tasks and projects than would justify a consistent internal memory. What would be helpful would be hierarchies of context, as in memory just for work tasks, personal tasks, or for any project where multiple chats should have the same context. reply binarymax 11 hours agoprevI just want to be able to search my chats.

I don't always want it to remember, but I'd like to it know details sometimes. For instance, I'd like it to know what my company does, so I don't need to explain it every time, however, I don't need/want this to be generalized so that if I ask something related to the industry, it responds with the details from my company. It already gets confused with this, and I'd prefer to set-up a taxonomy of sorts for when I'm writing a blog post so that it stays within the tone for the company, without always having to say how I want things described. But then I also don't want it to always be helping me write in a simplified manner (neuroscience) and I want it to give direct details. I guess I'm asking for a macro or something where I can give it a selection of \"base prompts\" and from that it understands tone, and context that I'd like to maintain and be able to request, I'm thinking I'm writing a blog post about X, as our company copywriter, give me a (speaks to that) Vs I'm trying to understand the neurological mechanisms of Y, can you tell me about the interaction with Z. Currently for either of these, I need to provide a long description of how I want it to respond. Specifically when looking at the neurology, it regularly gets confused with what slow-wave enhancement means (CLAS, PLLs) and will often respond with details about entrainment and other confused methods. reply nafizh 14 hours agoprevMy use of ChatGPT has just organically gone down 90%. It's unable to do any sort of task of non-trivial complexity e.g. complex coding tasks, writing complex prose that conforms precisely to what's been asked etc. Also I hate the fact that it has to answer everything in bullet points, even when it's not needed, clearly rlhf-ed. At this point, my question types have become what you would ask a tool like perplexity. reply Kranar 13 hours agoparentSure, but consider not using it for complex tasks. My productivity has skyrocketed with ChatGPT precisely because I don't use it for complex tasks, I use it to automate all of the trivial boilerplate stuff. ChatGPT writes excellent API documentation and can also document snippets of code to explain what they do, it does 80% of the work for unit tests, it can fill in simple methods like getters/setters, initialize constructors, I've even had it write a script to perform some substantial code refactoring. Use ChatGPT for grunt work and focus on the more advanced stuff yourself. reply hirvi74 5 hours agorootparentI torture ChatGPT with endless amounts random questions from my scattered brain. For example, I was looking up Epipens (Epinephrine), and I happened to notice the side-effects were similar to how overdosing on stimulants would manifest. So, I asked it, \"if someone was having a severe allergic reaction and no Epipen was available, then could Crystal Methamphetamine be used instead?\" GPT answered the question well, but the answer is no. Apparently, stimulants lack the targeted action on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors that makes epinephrine effective for treating anaphylaxis. I do not know why I ask these questions because I am not severely allergic to anything, nor anyone else that I know of, and I do not have nor wish to have access to Crystal Meth. I've been using GPT for helping prepare for dev technical interviews, and it's been pretty damn great. I also do not have access to a true senior dev at work either, so I tend to use GPT to kind of pair program. Honestly, it's been life changing. I have also not encountered any hallucinations that weren't easy to catch, but I mainly only ask it more project architectural, design questions, and a documentation search engine than using it to write code for me. Like you, I think not using GPT for overly complex tasks is best for now. I use it make life easier, but not easy. reply ekms 12 hours agorootparentprevIs it better at those types of things than copilot? Or even just conventional boilerplate IDE plugins? reply Kranar 11 hours agorootparentIf there is an IDE plugin then I use it first and foremost, but some refactoring can't be done with IDE plugins. Today I had to write some pybind11 bindings, basically export some C++ functionality to Python. The bindings involve templates and enums and I have a very particular way I like the naming convention to be when I export to Python. Since I've done this before so I copied and pasted examples of how I like to export templates to ChatGPT and then asked it to use that same coding style to export some more classes. It managed to do it without fail. This is a kind of grunt work that years ago would have taken me hours and it's demoralizing work. Nowadays when I get stuff like this, it's just such a breeze. As to copilot, I have not used it but I think it's powered by GPT4. reply hackerlight 2 hours agorootparentWhat tools/plugins do you use for this? Cursor.sh, Codium, CoPilot+VsCode, manually copy/pasting from chat.openai.com? reply OJFord 14 hours agoparentprevI haven't really tried to use it for coding, other than once (recently, so not before some decline) indirectly, which I was pretty impressed with: I asked about analyst expectations for the Bank of England base rate, then asked it to compare a fixed mortgage with a 'tracker' (base rate + x; always x points over the base rate). It spat out the repayment figures and totals over the two years, with a bit of waffle, and gave me a graph of cumulative payments for each. Then I asked to tweak the function used for the base rate, not recalling myself how to describe it mathematically, and it updated the model each time answering me in terms of the mortgage. Similar I think to what you're calling 'rlhf-ed', though I think useful for code, it definitely seems to kind of scratchpad itself, and stub out how it intends to solve a problem before filling in the implementation. Where this becomes really useful though is in asking for a small change it doesn't (it seems) recompute the whole thing, but just 'knows' to change one function from what it already has. They also seem to have it somehow set up to 'test' itself and occasionally it just says 'error' and tries again. I don't really understand how that works. Perplexity's great for finding information with citations, but (I've only used the free version) IME it's 'just' a better search engine (for difficult to find information, obviously it's slower), it suffers a lot more from the 'the information needs to be already written somewhere, it's not new knowledge' dismissal. reply nafizh 13 hours agorootparentTo be honest, when I say it has significantly worsened, I am comparing to the time when GPT-4 just came out. It really felt like we were on the verge of 'AGI'. In 3 hours, I coded up a complex piece of web app with chatgpt which completely remembered what we have been doing the whole time. So, it's sad that they have decided against the public having access to such strong models (and I do think it's intentional, not some side-effect of safety alignments though that might have contributed to the decision). reply joshspankit 12 hours agorootparentHave you tried feeding the exact same prompt in to the API or the playground? reply skywhopper 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm guessing it's not about safety, but about money. They're losing money hand over fist, and their popularity has forced them to scale back the compute dedicated to each response. Ten billion in Azure credits just doesn't go very far these days. reply anthonypasq 13 hours agorootparentprevi mean i feel like its fairly plausible that the smarter model costs more, and access to GPT-4 is honestly quite cheap all thing considered.

People talks about prompt engineering, but then it fails on really simple details, like \"on lowercase\", \"composed by max two words\", etc... and when you point at the failure, apologizes, and composes something else that forgets the other 95% of the original prompt. Or worse, apologizes and makes again the very same mistake. reply skywhopper 11 hours agorootparentThis sucks, but it's unlikely to be fixable, given that LLMs don't actually have any comprehension or reasoning capability.

For some things it's great, but it quickly forgets things that are critical for extended work. When trying to put together and sort of complex work: it does not remember things until I remind it which can make prompts that must contain all of the conversation up to that point and create non-repeatable responses that also tend to bring in the options of it's own programming or rules that corrupt my messaging. It's very frustrating, to the point where anything beyond a simple outline is more work than it's worth. reply karaterobot 14 hours agoprevWhat's the difference between this and the custom instructions text field they already have? I guess memories are stored with more granularity (which may not make a difference) and it's something the tool can write itself over time if you let it (and I assume it does it even if you don't). Is there anything else about it? The custom instructions have not, so far, affected my experience of using ChatGPT very much. reply glenstein 14 hours agoparentI think the big thing everyone wants is larger context windows, and so any new tool offering to help with memory is something that is valued to that end. Over time, what is being offered are these little compromise tools that provide a little bit of memory retention in targeted ways, presumably because it is less costly to offer this than generalized massive context windows. But I'd still rather have those. The small little tools make strange assumptions about intended use cases, such as the transactional/blank slate vs relationship-driven assumptions pointed out by another commenter. These assumptions are annoying, and raise general concerns about the core product disintegrating into a motley combination of one-off tools based on assumptions about use cases that I don't want to have anything to do with. reply shreezus 13 hours agoprevWhen can we expect autonomous agents & fleet management/agent orchestration?

The work I try to do with ChatGPT requires a longer memory than its default nature. I will get to a point where I I have 80% of what I want out of a conversation, then it forgets critical early parts of the conversation. Then it just unravels into completely forgetting everything. I want to teach ChatGPT some basic tenants and then build off of those.

Even ChatGPT was an incremental improvement on GPT 3, which was an incremental improvement on GPT 2, which was an incremental improvement on decoder-only transformers.

Sometimes something you say will cause ChatGPT to make a one-line note in its \"memory\" - something like: \"Is an experienced Python programmer.\" (I said to it \"Remember that I am an experienced Python programmer\") These then get injected into the system prompt along with your custom instructions. You can view those in settings and click \"delete\" to have it forget.

ChatGPT's memory feature feels like a joke compared to Kin's reply clwg 14 hours agoprevI use an API that I threw together which provides a backend for custom ChatGPT bots. There are only a few routes and parameters to keep it simple, anything complicated like arrays in json can cause issues. ChatGPT can perform searches, retrieve documents by an ID, or POST output for long-term storage, and I've integrated SearxNG and a headless browser API endpoint as well and try to keep it a closed loop so that all information passing to chatGPT from the web flows through my API first. I made it turn on my lights once too, but that was kind of dumb. When you start to pull in multiple large documents, especially all at once, things start to act weird, but pulling in documents one at a time seems to preserve context over multiple documents. There's a character limit of 100k per API request, so I'm assuming a 32k context window, but it's not totally clear what is going on in the background. It's kind of clunky but works well enough for me. It's not something that I would be putting sensitive info into - but it's also much cheaper than using GPT-4 via the API and I maintain control of the data flow and storage. reply Nimitz14 15 hours agoprevSo, so, so curious how they are implementing this. reply lxgr 15 hours agoparentI wouldn't be surprised if they essentially just add it to the prompt. (\"You are ChatGPT...

Just like when you add a file to your prompt / custom GPTs. Adding the entire file (or memory in this case) would take up too much of the context. So just query the DB and if there's a match add it to the prompt after the conversation started. reply lxgr 15 hours agorootparentThese \"memories\" seem rather short, much shorter than the average document in a knowledge base or FAQ, for example. Maybe they do get compressed to embedding vectors, though. I could imagine that once there's too many, it would indeed make sense to classify them as a database, though: \"Prefers cats over dogs\" is probably not salient information in too many queries. reply minimaxir 15 hours agoparentprevMy hunch is that they summarize the conversation periodically and inject that as additional system prompt constraints. That was a common hack for the LLM context length problem, but now that context length is \"solved\" it could be more useful to align output a bit better. reply msp26 15 hours agoparentprevSurely someone can use a jailbreak to dump the context right?

Anyway, it seems to be implemented quite well with a lot of user controls so that is nice. I think it's possible I will soon upgrade to a Team plan and get the family on that. A habit I have is that if it gets something wrong I place the correction there in the text. The idea being that I could eventually scroll down and find it.

    "title": "Strategies for Centering Elements in CSS, Including Flexbox and CSS Grid",
    "originLink": "https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/",
    "originBody": "Introduction For a long time, centering an element within its parent was a surprisingly tricky thing to do. As CSS has evolved, we've been granted more and more tools we can use to solve this problem. These days, we're spoiled for choice! I decided to create this tutorial to help you understand the trade-offs between different approaches, and to give you an arsenal of strategies you can use, to handle centering in all sorts of scenarios. Honestly, this turned out to be way more interesting than I initially thought 😅. Even if you've been using CSS for a while, I bet you'll learn at least 1 new strategy! Link to this heading Centering with auto margins The first strategy we'll look at is one of the oldest. If we want to center an element horizontally, we can do so using margins set to the special value auto: .element { max-width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } .element .element Reveal Margin Container Width: 100% First, we need to constrain the element's width; by default, elements in Flow layout will expand horizontally to fill the available space, and we can't really center something that is full-width. I could constrain the width with a fixed value (eg. 200px), but really what I want in this case is for the element to shrinkwrap around its content. fit-content is a magical value that does exactly this. Essentially, it makes “width” behave like “height”, so that the element’s size is determined by its contents. Why am I setting max-width instead of width? Well, my goal is to stop the element from expanding horizontally. I want to clamp its maximum size. If I used width instead, it would lock it to that size, and the element would overflow when the container is really narrow. If you drag that “Container Width” slider all the way to the left, you can see that the element shrinks with its container. Now that our element is constrained, we can center it with auto margins. I like to think of auto margins like Hungry Hungry Hippos. Each auto margin will try to gobble up as much space as possible. For example, check out what happens if we only set margin-left: auto: .element { max-width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; } .element .element Reveal Margin Container Width: 100% When margin-left is the only side with auto margins, all of the extra space gets applied as margin to that side. When we set both margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto, the two hippos each gobble up an equal amount of space. This forces the element to the center. Also: I've been using margin-left and margin-right because they're familiar, but there's a better, more-modern way to do this: .element { max-width: fit-content; margin-inline: auto; } .element .element Reveal Margin Container Width: 100% margin-inline will set both margin-left and margin-right to the same value (auto). It has very good browser support, having landed in all major browsers several years ago. Logical properties margin-inline is more than just a convenient shorthand for margin-left + margin-right. It's part of a collection of logical properties, designed to make it easier to internationalize the web. In English, characters are written in a horizontal line from left to right. Those characters are composed into words and sentences, and assembled into “blocks” (paragraphs, headings, lists, etc). Blocks are stacked vertically, from top to bottom. We can think of this as the orientation of English-language websites. This isn't universal, though! Some languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, are written from right to left. Other languages, like Chinese, have historically been written vertically, with characters running from top to bottom, and blocks running left to right. * The primary goal of logical properties is to create an abstraction that sits above these differences. Instead of setting margin-left for left-to-right languages and flipping it to margin-right for right-to-left languages, we can instead use margin-inline-start. The margin will automatically be applied to the correct side, depending on the page's language. Even though this centering method has been around forever, I still find myself reaching for it on a regular basis! It's particularly useful when we want to center a single child, without affecting any of its siblings (for example, an image in-between paragraphs in a blog post). Let's continue on our centering journey. Link to this heading Centering with Flexbox Flexbox is designed to give us a ton of control when it comes to distributing a group of items along a primary axis. It offers some really powerful tools for centering! Let's start by centering a single element, both horizontally and vertically: .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; } .element Container Width: 100% Container Height: 100% The really cool thing about Flexbox centering is that it works even when the children don’t fit in their container! Try shrinking the width/height, and notice that the element overflows symmetrically. It also works for multiple children. We can control how they stack with the flex-direction property: .container { display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 4px; } 1 2 3 Flex Direction: row column row-reverse column-reverse Out of all the centering patterns we'll explore in this tutorial, this is probably the one I use the most. It's a great jack-of-all-trades, a great default option. Link to this heading Centering within the viewport So far, we've been looking at how to center an element within its parent container. But what if we want to center an element in a different context? Certain elements like dialogs, prompts, and GDPR banners need to be centered within the viewport. This is the domain of positioned layout, a layout mode used when we want to take something out of flow and anchor it to something else. Here's what this looks like: .element { position: fixed; inset: 0px; width: 12rem; height: 5rem; max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100dvh; margin: auto; } .element .element Container Width: 100% Container Height: 100% Of all the strategies we'll discuss, this one is probably the most complex. Let's break it down. We're using position: fixed, which anchors this element to the viewport. I like to think of the viewport like a pane of glass that sits in front of the website, like the window of a train that shows the landscape scrolling by. An element with position: fixed is like a ladybug that lands on the window. Next, we're setting inset: 0px, which is a shorthand that sets top, left, right, and bottom all to the same value, 0px. With only these two properties, the element would stretch to fill the entire viewport, growing so that it's 0px from each edge. This can be useful in some contexts, but it's not what we're going for here. We need to constrain it. The exact values we pick will vary on the specifics of each situation, but in general we want to set default values (with width and height), as well as max values (max-width and max-height), so that the element doesn't overflow on smaller viewports. There's something interesting here: we've set up an impossible condition. Our element can't be 0px from the left and 0px from the right and only 12rem wide (assuming the viewport is wider than 12rem). We can only pick 2: .element { position: fixed; width: 12rem; } Pick two: left: 0px right: 0px width: 12rem The CSS rendering engine resolves this tension by prioritizing. It will listen to the width constraint, since that seems important. And if it can't anchor to the left and the right, it'll pick an option based on the page's language; so, in a left-to-right language like English, it'll sit along the left edge. But! When we bring our old friend margin: auto into the equation, something interesting happens. It changes how the browser resolves the impossible condition; instead of anchoring to the left edge, it centers it. And, unlike auto margins in Flow layout, we can use this trick to center an element both horizontally and vertically. .element { position: fixed; inset: 0px; width: 12rem; height: 5rem; max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100dvh; margin: auto; } .element .element Reveal Margin Container Width: 100% Container Height: 100% It's a lot to remember, but there are 4 key ingredients for this trick. Fixed positioning Anchoring to all 4 edges with inset: 0px Constrained width and height Auto margins We can use the same trick to center something in a single direction. For example, we can build a GDPR cookie banner that is horizontally centered, but anchored near the bottom of the viewport: .element { position: fixed; left: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 8px; width: 12rem; max-width: calc( 100vw - 8px * 2 ); margin-inline: auto; } We value your privacy data. We use cookies to enhance your browser experience by selling this data to advertisers. This is extremely valuable. Sounds good Container Width: 100% Container Height: 100% By omitting top: 0px, we remove the impossible condition in the vertical direction, and our banner is anchored to the bottom edge. As a nice touch, I used the calc function to clamp the max width, so that there's always a bit of buffer around the element. I also swapped margin: auto for margin-inline: auto, which isn't strictly necessary, but feels more precise. Link to this heading Centering elements with unknown sizes The approach described above requires that we give our element a specific size, but what about when we don't know how big it should be? In the past, we had to resort to transform hacks to accomplish this, but fortunately, our friend fit-content can help here as well! .element { position: fixed; inset: 0; width: fit-content; height: fit-content; margin: auto; } A Container Width: 100% # of Characters: 1 This will cause the element to shrink around its contents. We can still set a max-width if we'd like to constrain it (eg. max-width: 60vw), but we don't need to set a max-width; the element will automatically stay contained within the viewport. Link to this heading Centering with CSS Grid The most terse way I know to center something both horizontally and vertically is with CSS Grid: .container { display: grid; place-content: center; } .element Container Width: 100% Container Height: 100% The place-content property is a shorthand for both justify-content and align-content, applying the same value to both rows and columns. The result is a 1×1 grid with a cell right in the middle of the parent container. Link to this heading Differences from Flexbox This solution looks quite a bit like our Flexbox solution, but it's important to keep in mind that it uses a totally different layout algorithm. In my own work, I've found that the CSS Grid solution isn't as universally effective as the Flexbox one. For example, consider the following setup: .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; } .element { width: 50%; height: 50%; } .element Layout Algorithm: flexbox grid Weird, right? Why does the CSS Grid version get so teensy-tiny?! Here's the deal: the child element is given width: 50% and height: 50%. In Flexbox, these percentages are calculated based on the parent element, .container, which is what we want. In CSS Grid, however, the percentages are relative to the grid cell. We're saying that the child element should be 50% as wide as its column, and 50% as tall as its row. Now, we haven't actually given the row/column an explicit size; we haven't defined grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows. When we omit this information, the grid tracks will calculate their size based on their contents, shrinkwrapping around whatever is in each row/column. The end result is that our grid cell is the same size as .element’s original size, and then the element shrinks to 50% of that grid cell: .container { display: grid; place-content: center; } .element { width: 50%; height: 100%; } .element Element width: 50% Element height: 100% This is a whole rabbithole, and I don't want to get too far off track; my point is that CSS Grid is a sophisticated layout algorithm, and sometimes, the extra complexity gets in the way. We could add some more CSS to fix this code, but I think it's simpler to use Flexbox instead. Link to this heading Centering a stack of elements CSS Grid gives us one more centering super-power. With CSS Grid, we can assign multiple elements to the same cell: .container { display: grid; place-content: center; } .element { grid-row: 1; grid-column: 1; } .element .element .element .element # of items: 1 We still have a 1×1 grid, except now we're cramming multiple children to sit in that cell with grid-row / grid-column. In case it's not clear, here's a quick sketch of the HTML for this kind of setup: HTML In other layout modes, the elements would stack horizontally or vertically, but with this CSS Grid setup, the elements stack back-to-front, since they're all told to share the same grid space. Pretty cool, right? Incredibly, this can work even when the child elements are different sizes! Check this out: .container { display: grid; place-content: center; place-items: center; } .element { grid-row: 1; grid-column: 1; } .element .element .element .element Reveal Grid # of items: 1 In this demo, dashed red lines are added to show the grid row and column. Notice that they expand to contain the largest child; with all the elements added, the resulting cell is as wide as the pink skyline image, and as tall as the colourful space image! We do need one more property to make this work: place-items: center. place-items is a shorthand for justify-items and align-items, and these properties control the alignment of the images within the grid cell. Without this property, the grid cell would still be centered, but the images within that cell would all stack in the top-left corner: .container { display: grid; place-content: center; } .element { grid-row: 1; grid-column: 1; } .element .element .element .element Reveal Grid place-items: start (default) center This is pretty advanced stuff! You can learn more about how the CSS Grid layout mode works in a recent tutorial I published, An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid. Link to this heading Centering text Text is its own special thing in CSS. We can't influence individual characters using the techniques explored in this post. For example, if we try to center a paragraph with Flexbox, we'll center the block of text, not the text itself: .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; } Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s. Container Width: 100% Flexbox is centering the paragraph within the viewport, but it doesn't affect the individual characters. They remain left-aligned. We need to use text-align to center the text: .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; text-align: center; } Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s. Container Width: 100% Link to this heading Centering in the future Earlier, we saw how we can use auto margins to center an element horizontally in Flow layout. If we want that element to be centered vertically as well, we need to switch to a different layout mode, like Flexbox or Grid. …or do we? Check this out: .container { align-content: center; } .element { max-width: fit-content; margin-inline: auto; } .element Container Width: 100% Container Height: 100% What the heck?? align-content is a CSS Grid thing, but we aren't setting display: grid here. How is this working? One of the biggest epiphanies I've ever had about CSS is that it's a collection of layout algorithms. The properties we write are inputs to those algorithms. align-content was first implemented in Flexbox, and took on an even bigger role in CSS Grid, but it wasn't implemented in the default layout algorithm, Flow layout. Until now. As I write this in early 2024, browser vendors are in the process of implementing align-content in Flow layout, so that it controls the “block” direction alignment of content. It's still early days; this new behaviour is only available in Chrome Canary (behind a flag) and Safari Technical Preview. (I should note, the demo above is fake. I got a feel for the new align-content support in Chrome Canari and Safari TP, and then recreated the exact same behaviour using Flexbox. Sorry for the deception!) Is this actually useful? As far as I can tell, this new option doesn't unlock any new doors, in terms of what sorts of UIs we can create. We can already reproduce the same behaviour using the techniques explored in this tutorial. Still, I'm looking forward to this becoming widely-available. It's always felt a bit silly to me that we had to flip to an entirely separate layout mode just to center something. Link to this heading Going beyond the patterns So, for many years, I treated CSS like a collection of patterns. I had a bunch of memorized snippets that would paste from my brain, to solve whatever problem I was currently facing. This worked alright, but it did feel pretty limiting. And every now and then, things would inexplicably break; a snippet I’d used hundreds of times would suddenly behave differently. When I took the time to learn CSS at a deeper level, my experience with the language completely changed. So many things clicked into place. Instead of relying on memorized snippets, I could instead rely on my intuition! ✨ In this tutorial, we’ve explored a handful of useful centering patterns, and I hope they’ll come in handy the next time you need to center something. Truthfully, though, we've only scratched the surface here; there are so many ways we can use modern CSS to center stuff! Instead of memorizing even more snippets, I think it's better to build a robust mental model of how CSS works, so that we can come up with solutions on-the-fly! I spent 2 years of my life creating the ultimate resource for developing a deep understanding of CSS. It's called CSS for JavaScript Developers. If you found this tutorial helpful, you’ll get so much out of my course. We take a similar approach to the entire CSS language, building an intuition for how all of the different layout algorithms work. It includes interactive text content like this blog post, but also videos, exercises, real-world-inspired workshops, and even a few minigames. It's unlike any other course you’ve taken. If this sounds interesting to you, you can learn more here: CSS for JavaScript Developers Link to this heading When to use which method Before we wrap up, let's summarize what we've learned by building a sort of decision tree, so that we can figure out when to use which method. If we want to horizontally center a single element without disturbing any of its siblings, we can use the Flow layout auto margin strategy. If we have a piece of floating UI, like a modal or a banner, we can center it using Positioned layout and auto margins. If we want to center a stack of elements one on top of the other, we can use CSS Grid. If we want to center text, we can use text-align. This can be used in conjunction with any of the additional methods. Finally, in most other situations, we can use Flexbox. It's the most versatile method; it can be used to center one or multiple children, horizontally and/or vertically, whether they're contained or overflowing. Like a carpenter’s workshop, we've assembled quite a lot of helpful tools in this tutorial, each with its own specialized purpose. I hope that you’ve learned some new strategies here!

I think the big issue in the 2000's was cross compatibility, and how seemingly simple elements on one web engine simply wouldn't work or look right in another. IE 6 was infamous for this. Tables were one of the few consistent elements, could be dynamically generated with ease, and simply feels easier to think about from a designer POV I think that misalignment (no pun intended) is what lead to the huge snowball that is using frameworks upon frameworks to solve issues that some simple HTML/CSS should have solved.

I vaguely remember that until 2008-2009 (maybe I'm off by 1-2 years) something trivial as rounded corners also was a pain. I also remember that about 80% of the CSS pain was caused by Microsoft Intenet Explorer 6.0. It was complete garbage when dealing with CSS and Javascript (I was working with huge JS codebases at the time). But nobody in the web world could ignore it because it had a huge market share. I hate that browser and Microsoft with passion till this day.

Though I would not rely on auto-layout behavior in general since I've always seen subtle differences across the three major browsers whenever using tables without a fixed layout. reply ChuckMcM 14 hours agoprevNice article, the comments here are kind of amazing for a nominally technical audience. It is almost as if people have no idea how difficult automatic page layout and formatting is. There are literally PhD thesis topics on it[1]. And to expect that complexity to be abstracted away into some sort of simple \"do-what-I-mean\" expression? That just isn't going to happen. Go look at Gwern Branwen's web site[2]. That is art. But the trick is decide how you want the site to look and then constraining your written material to be expressible in that style. I've been looking at web page layout since 1995 when I joined a startup that was doing the \"first magazine on the web about Golf!\"[3] When the Zen Garden folks did their web site and started the 'A List Apart' mailing list which is now a website[4] it really helped me understand just what one was up against if you wanted to produce web content that rendered nicely on a wide variety of projections. And yes, the term projection is intentional because the function of going from semantic content to presentation on a screen or paper or other flat surface of finite size, is a mapping (or projection) from a native space into the rule set of the destination space. That rule set consists of both physical constraints (pixels per inch, total pixels horizonally and vertically, color capability) and software constraints (how much of the underlying capability can the browser software that is currently running express). Not to mention that every browser wants to do their own special thing. So yes, CSS is a \"hot mess\" for people who decide one day \"I'm going to build a web page from scratch.\" And yet, that mess is really just an abundance of choices rather than constraints on what you can do. The process is the same for everyone, find the tools that help you achieve the results you want and then package your material into a form that you can easily convert that into that look.

Because that would be a bigger nightmare to deal with than CSS. I like that when I visit a web page on my mobile phone, it loads regardless of whether or not the site owners hired someone to build a completely separate interface. And I like that when I design interfaces for phones and for large screens, I don't need to learn 2 languages to do it. And I like that when I stack two browser windows next to each other on a 1920x1080 monitor they resize and I can read both of them. When people say that they don't want to worry about multiple screen sizes in their layout, they mean that they want an interface that works on one screen size and ignores everything else. And that would be a huge loss for accessibility and innovation if the web pushed developers in that direction. The reason it would be simpler for people to work with a more targeted language is because they wouldn't build the other interfaces at all. They'd learn one language, target one device that their most predominant customers used, and then we'd have a mobile Internet and a desktop Internet and they'd be separate things with no expectations that sites would work on both devices. ---- And I think this sort of gets to the complaints about complexity in general, because the complexity of this UI design is reflecting a reality that good interfaces are adaptable and people have multi-faceted needs from their software. Even on desktop, people use different screen resolutions, they scale fonts, they mess with layout. And there's this subtle idea behind complaints about complexity that when you dig into it is not actually \"why do I have to target so many devices\" but is really \"why do people use so many devices? Why isn't the world more uniform, why on earth are people changing their screen resolutions, what's wrong with them? Why can't they just decide on a device and stick with it?\" But good UX design is about designing for the real world, not for a hypothetical standardized human, and in the same way that cars need adjustable seats and can't just say \"well on average everyone is this height and width\", good UX acknowledges and responds to the idea that software and content are delivered in multiple contexts. Of course that's a balancing act, it does make interface design more complicated, and it's not something we can do perfectly. But it is a balancing act, it's not a problem we can solve by saying \"heck it, everyone needs to stop buying HDPI laptops.\" I mean, we're not all Linux developers, we can't all just pretend that touchscreens don't exist ;) The same exact complaints show up with the extensible web and with progressive fallbacks in general. It is real annoying to build software that degrades nicely depending on what hardware support someone has and what features they've turned on and off in their browser. But it's also a better way to build software that better reflects how software is used in the real world by real people. reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentAll that said, there’s still no way to just make a layout and it be compatible with all screens. You still have to do mobile, tablet, pc modes. (And there’s enough sites that are pc-only or mobile-only.) You still have to make 2-3 layouts, but in one source. Well, what’s the argument against gp’s point again? Sorry, but this statusquoism and rationales that essentially change nothing drive me mad sometimes. reply danShumway 8 hours agorootparentThe web and CSS make it reasonably feasible to support most of those layouts well with at most 2-3 layouts in one source. My point is that it is impossible to get the same level of results doing fully device-specific and domain-specific languages without considerably more work -- more work than would ever be undertaken by the majority of people building for the web today. If you want an indie web, if you want websites that aren't just built by corporations and professional development teams, HTML and CSS is what enables those indie websites to exist and to work across every device you own. The proposal of using interface-specific languages and abstractions wouldn't work. Doesn't work, in fact, when you look the places where it's being attempted as a UI strategy. Like democracy, universal design abstractions such as CSS are the worst way to design interfaces that work in the real world for real users across diverse devices and configurations -- except for every other way. If we asked devs to actually use separate domain languages for mobile devices and desktop devices, the web would be a lot smaller and a lot more limited and a lot less flexible and a lot worse for end users. reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentI don’t think our common ancestor in this subthread suggested separate languages for different screen sizes. Did they? reply danShumway 7 hours agorootparent> The problem with css is almost entirely self inflicted, though. Yes, layout is hard. Why make it harder by aiming for the model we now have? Specifically, why aim for one major model that will fit all pages? It's possible I interpreted that incorrectly? But if their problem is just making different layouts then I don't see what the issue is. CSS has breakpoints. You can already make different layouts for different screen sizes. You're not required to have one set of rules that apply to every page size. The only criticism that makes sense to me as a reading is that they don't want a common set of UI paradigms and language features that allow targeting multiple devices and they want a more specific language targeted at describing a subset of those interfaces -- because that's what CSS is. That's the only thing that CSS is, it's just a universal rules-based language. You can design different layouts for different page sizes, you can even on the serverside serve entirely separate HTML pages for mobile and desktop devices. The only issue I can think of left to complain about with CSS being too general is that CSS is a common language designed to be used in all of those situations instead of in only one of them. Did they mean that they wanted CSS to have separate terminology and paradigms and ways to tackle those problems built into the language? It does! And that's exactly what people complain about, that's exactly where the \"why are their 5 ways to do this\" complaints come from, they come from CSS having lots of different ways to achieve the same effects based on the individual unique needs of the specific interface being created. What's the alternative, have one way of doing everything for every interface? The original commenter I was replying to said that they didn't want that. They want multiple models for different formats, and CSS has that and lets you use them and target as many interfaces as you want, and there are ways to detect and serve different CSS and HTML based on device agents, and so... I don't know, if they don't want different languages, then what is the complaint? reply taeric 10 hours agorootparentprevA problem is that none of the arguments you are offering are bad, logically. It feels very appealing to think you can build a system that would solve \"laying out text\" for all time. For me, what they lack is evidence that stands any stronger than video games. Specifically, I've played different games on various screen sizes and orientations that largely work as you would expect. They are not perfect, of course, but they work better than most web pages seem to. And they do that, largely, without the same reliance on something like CSS that web pages need. More, it isn't like we weren't laying out billboard displays long before the web came to be. Nor is it realistic that billboards have at all the same concerns that a pocket sized phone will have. At large, you shouldn't even use the same fonts between those options. Heck, taken farther, a billboard can hold a slogan, that is about it. This would be the same as if you tried to use HTML/CSS to make a poster for a movie. Which, sure, you can make a bit of an effort with it. I just don't see it being any better than letting a designer or probably an automated system layout several standard sizes with the standard type in the standard locations. Pulling it in, I'll be delighted to get proven wrong and find that we have converged to a great abstraction for laying out content. I, of course, do not /know/ that it can't be done. I do pull my hair out at the amount of effort people will go to in order to have the system layout a set of divs, when most designs could probably have done a lot of that math up front and worked with far fewer nested elements than we seem to typically see. reply auggierose 9 hours agorootparentGood layout is simple. But can it be flexibly done without a good sense for abstraction and math? No. I mean, just look at the hot shit that is Tailwind, that's what people come up with while fighting abstraction. CSS was a mess, but together with React is now the best language for building GUIs. You can build up any abstraction you want in React, even Hello World! In fact, that's what I did over the weekend for my Electron desktop application, writing my own little library of components, including tabs and treeviews, using only CSS and React and no third-party libraries apart from that.

A lot of abstractions are complicated under the hood -- the high-level graphics formats that are used in engines are under the hood doing a ton of complicated tradeoffs and tricks to try and get the same sprites to render on Metal, Vulkan, OpenGL, and DirectX. I tend to avoid over-abstraction when I can, but I still have to ask -- it a problem that those abstractions are complicated under the hood if they work for the developers that use them? Pipewire is pretty complicated under the hood to maintain compatibility with multiple setups; does that mean we can't have a universal audio interface for Linux and every device should be programming separately for ALSA and PulseAudio? reply danShumway 9 hours agorootparentprev> For me, what they lack is evidence that stands any stronger than video games. Specifically, I've played different games on various screen sizes and orientations that largely work as you would expect. They are not perfect, of course, but they work better than most web pages seem to. And they do that, largely, without the same reliance on something like CSS that web pages need. Video game interfaces are a ton of work, and porting between different control schemes and devices is a ton of work and that's why a lot of games don't do it. Look at the work required to handle devices like the Steam deck and the amount of work Valve has put into trying to make mouse-controlled games usable on the device. It's not easy, it's significantly more work than building for the web. Of course it's helped by the fact that Valve does have general abstracted concepts of input that games can hook into that are shared between different controllers. Modern games don't do input per-controller, they use abstraction libraries like SDL that are designed to allow them handle a lot of different input schemes with a single codebase. And even that is a crapshoot, if you're playing indie titles on a PC you are going to be rolling the dice on whether Xbox controllers and Dualshock controllers are supported or whether only one of them works. I like that when I use the web, even weird keyboards still type into webpages. We still don't have a standardized way to do controller rebindings in games -- Valve's Steam Input works by emulating a second controller for games that aren't using Valve input APIs and pretending to press the buttons the game expects to see. So even with all of the advantages of cross-platform frameworks, the games industry still doesn't have a great track record for building games across devices. You're pointing out that there exist games that do build separate interfaces for different devices. Sure. And agreed, when devs put in the extra work, you can have great results that are far better than the average website. The difference is that basically every website works on my phone. Games aren't even close to that level of compatibility and most teams don't have the resources or time to put in the work to support every device and control scheme. The world of games is exactly what we don't want on the web, because if having a website interface for mobile and for desktop means that everyone needs to design and program two separate interfaces using two separate languages, we will have about the same number of websites on both mobile and desktop as we have games on both mobile and desktop -- ie, very, very few of them. It's a blessing for compatibility that engines like Unity and Godot allow targeting multiple platforms and form-factors with a single codebase. I wish I had to work less to get that same level of abstraction in my video game interfaces. And all of this is before we even get into all of the other problems of game interfaces -- the all-too-common lack of ability to do anything with text sizes, the lack of accessibility controls, the inability to resize windows in or out of games. My goodness do I not want my web pages to act like video games, that would be a miserable experience. It's not uncommon for me to see video games that literally won't allow changing resolutions without restarting the game. Imagine if your browser forced you to close and re-open the webpage in order to resize your window. ---- > It feels very appealing to think you can build a system that would solve \"laying out text\" for all time. We have not built a system that can solve laying out text for all time. That system doesn't exist and can't be built, it is impossible. That's exactly what we're saying: we are trying to build a system that does the best possible job of universally solving that problem, but it's incredibly difficult and necessarily results in complexity and tradeoffs. But the only belief more naive than thinking we can have one universal layout system for everything is the belief that we don't need a universal layout system and that it's possible to reduce user needs into a finite list of use-cases that can be individually supported. That reduction isn't possible, the use-cases for end users are arbitrarily large and constantly growing and it is not possible for anyone to sit down and build a single list of formats that need to be supported on the web. That's just fantasy, people are too diverse. I use both a 1920x1080 monitor and a 3840x2160 touchscreen monitor hooked up to the same computer. Every single website I visit handles both, fluidly, when switching windows between them. A lot of games have no idea what to do and a nontrivial number of native apps struggle with it as well. But the web works, and then people show up like, \"well, I shouldn't need support that.\" Well, I'm glad you're forced to use CSS then because I know what the web would look like if you weren't forced to. reply taeric 9 hours agorootparentYes, getting an interface to work is a ton of work. If you felt that I was claiming there are easier ways that are not a lot of work, my apologies. I did not intend it that way. My point would be more that the work Valve has put into the Deck has enabled far more than the work the standards committees have done with CSS. You can correctly argue these are solving different problems. But my assertion is that I have seen more impressive content layout and interactions from the Steam Deck than I have really with the web. I'm curious what you'd offer as the reasoning there? You seem to be taking it that the games industry isn't very cross device focused. But, that is missing that current gen games are usually at the absolute bleeding edge of what the absolute best devices are even capable of. It is not at all surprising that those do not work cross device that well. You are, of course, correct that there are some generic engines that allow better cross device development now than have existed in the past. Do any of them use something like CSS for laying out a menu screen? If not, why not? How about the inventory or character creation screens of games? Would you think those should be designed in the same way that something like a character builder webpage would use? I also have large monitors, and it is ridiculously amusing how many websites do not work well when I have my windows tiling. My favorite is just two windows side by side on the main monitor, but parts of the menu of many sites will not load due to confusion over what my window width should be. To my absolute annoyance, I have found this will often not be consistent between browsers. Now, is it fair that \"bugs mean the entire thing is nonsense?\" No. And I do apologize that I can see how my post read that way. Realistically, the amount of manpower that has gone into CSS has landed on something that is quite capable. But we gave up on \"user stylesheets\" ages ago. And the cascading nature of how things interact is almost certainly not well understood by a large portion of the practitioners. My annoyance is far less on what is capable with CSS nowadays, and much more annoyed at the rube goldberg machine that is how the vast majority of websites are layed out. reply danShumway 8 hours agorootparent> My point would be more that the work Valve has put into the Deck has enabled far more than the work the standards committees have done with CSS. Citation very, very much needed. Valve's work on Steam Input absolutely pales in comparison to the web. The number of supported games is minuscule. If the Steam Deck is our standard for cross-compatibility on the web, that's just really low standards. That's not the world I want to live in, CSS is better. > But, that is missing that current gen games are usually at the absolute bleeding edge of what the absolute best devices are even capable of. It is not at all surprising that those do not work cross device that well. No, the opposite. I'm talking about indie titles and AA titles and the average games put out by normal studios. Ironically, the giant AAA studios often have much better accessibility controls and cross-platform support. If you buy a AAA game, you're much more likely to have access to something like text scaling or dyslexic-friendly fonts or multiple input schemes, because those studios have the resources to care more about diverse use-cases, those studios have the money and developers to ask questions like \"what happens if the user's TV is far away from them?\" Indie studios don't. And the fact that there's a divide between indie and AAA games on something as basic as resizing text, something that is supported on every single website -- that should be enough to show you that this \"individually supported device\" concept is just not workable in the real world. The games industry can't even get universal text scaling and you think that's a success story? > But we gave up on \"user stylesheets\" ages ago. And the cascading nature of how things interact is almost certainly not well understood by a large portion of the practitioners Sure, training is difficult and the web is counterintuitive to UI designers that are used to working in Photoshop, but I would still maintain that I have far fewer interface problems on the web than I do on native devices and in games, and that's not even taking into account that I see websites put up by far worse developers and far smaller teams with far smaller budgets than any of the native apps on my computer or phone. We're never going to be perfect at this. One issue is that ironically many UI problems on the web when you dig into them often end up being due to concessions to developers on device-specific breakpoints. The web allows you to decide that you aren't going to care about being responsive and to act like you're building a video game that will only ever be displayed full-screen. If you really want to, you can design your interfaces like you're an indie developer using Unity and you can absolute position all of your divs. And there are problems with having those escape hatches, but the concessions are important because this is an unsolveable problem and sometimes devs need those escape hatches. So we add even more complexity onto an unsolveable problem to help cover use-cases that we can't cover any other way. But solveable or not, complex or not, ignoring the problem is not the solution. And it still is just very clearly the case to me that if we're looking at what platform does responsive design the best and which platform has the best compatibility stats between multiple devices, the web is going to win every single comparison with every other platform. It's not even close. Yeah, things could be better, and yeah, CSS has problems, but the alternatives are just so, so much worse for actual end-users. Getting the vast majority of content on a platform to work across every single device from voice assistants to desktops to tablets to phones to VR is an achievement that no other platform can point to. And CSS does that without requiring you to have a AAA game budget when you build a website. reply troupo 2 hours agorootparentprevThe world invents resizable windows in the 1980s (or perhaps 1970s).

Tables have border, padding, and a cell-based layout arranged in columns. At a stretch they and their cells need white space around them, ie “margins”. Tables are a long established element in layout. And it turns out tables actually contain this wisdom, that all elements should work a bit like table cells: they should follow the box model (fairly obvious to anyone working in typography) but also that they should be arranged in columns (much less obvious and the foundation of grid layout and bootstrap). It’s a natural evolution to come across some layout problems, solve them with tables (as any typesetting system is likely to support tables), and then realise that you need a new facility that has some of the properties of tables but not all of them. CSS has discovered this. Oddly, some systems have not - for example, word processors have not unified elements under a box model etc. reply bradley13 15 hours agoprevThe \"how to center\" is a classic question for CSS. The fact that it is not blindingly obvious is indicative. CSS is a miasma. A kitchen sink collection of stuff designed, not by one committee, but by several committees simultaneously.

I think this question comes up so often because it is simply the natural question to ask. What are the first things someone learning how to make a web page visually look how they want is going to learn? Probably text size, color, background color, and alignment. All of these except alignment translate pretty much 1:1 from pre-css days. Color on the body tag, size/color on the tag surrounding the text you want styled. Or, css color/font-size property on the surrounding tag, or background-color on the body. All very similar. Prior to CSS, if you wanted content centered, you just slapped it in atag. Didn't matter if it was text or html objects like divs, tables, buttons, etc. IMO too many people expected CSS to work like what we had in the past - no distinction between inline and block objects - and when CSS didn't fit their pre-conceived mental model, these questions came up. And centering just happens to fit in the niche of being basic enough that beginners want to know about it. reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentAccording to this, most CSS issues boil down to “you don’t know CSS and have a wrong mental model”.

Email clients handle the CSS code to varying degree of support when wrapping responsively so even if you think your layout looks good with wrapping it's because CSS influenced the layout in whatever particular client you are using. If client doesn't support CSS or the CSS properties you've used: jank email. Email unfortunately requires you to code like 1999 in this regard.

You're often not building something from scratch but rather updating old code, and having to figure out why the CSS was done in one particular way for what reason, and what might break in which edge cases, and whether you should/can update it or not, and which one of several solutions when it's not simple. If you look through the article, none of it is intuitive. Even with flexbox, the horizontal setting is called \"justify-content\" while the vertical is \"align-items\". I personally simply can't remember what a lot of CSS properties are called anymore -- there are so many now, and the names are so arbitrary. (Even hyphens are maddening -- why is it \"white-space: nowrap\" instead of \"whitespace: no-wrap\"?) At the end of the day, there's a big difference between: 1) Simple, intuitive, reliable building blocks that let you build complex solutions out of simple parts 2) Convoluted, partially-overlapping, constantly-needing-to-Google building blocks that let you build complex solutions out of complex sets of parts A language like Go or Python is #1.

I buy the value in having them be main-axis and cross-axis properties rather than horizontal/vertical by name, but I don't know that I buy the justify/align distinction to represent that as being meaningful or memorable. reply RheingoldRiver 3 hours agorootparentMy mnemonic for justify vs align is to picture the \"justification\" options in a word processor. you can justify content to the side of the primary axis when it's written right-to-left. so, justify is main axis, and the one that's not justify (align) is the one that's not main axis (cross axis). What I don't remember ever is does flex default to row or column; so I write a lot of unnecessary `flex-direction:row;` but if you are fine with always specifying a direction, the default doesnt really matter either. reply chihuahua 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's very easy to remember all this, if you can just memorize the acronym AMIJAMITCOE (\"Ami-Jamit-Coe\"): A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors. reply pests 9 hours agorootparentprevIts similar with changing \"left\" and \"right\" to be \"start\" and \"end\" because we built in a lot of assumptions with LTR languages that don't apply to RTL. reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentprevThey could leave the elegance by calling it align-x and align-y and turn-right. Or make them independent of “direction”. Or allow both ways so people could use them in corresponding situations.

Feels almost end-game for CSS. There was a reason people loved Bootstrap's grid system so much, Flexbox does all that and more straight in your browser. Cannot over-express how much I love it. reply thr33 11 hours agorootparentI too love flex but your comment is a bit off. bootstraps grid system is a fake grid modelled on flex. building layout grids with flex in general is definitely not endgame, its actually very tedious and unreliable. css grid however is perfect for this and represents one of the most underutilised powerhouses in the css kit reply mminer237 10 hours agorootparentI haven't really found much use for CSS grid. It's fine if you're doing a strict grid, but it seems to have all the limitations of a literal table to me. You can't put two objects in one cell. It has no way to wrap. It just isn't responsive at all. You can't make a sidebar with grid. You basically have to just write multiple styles and switch between them with media queries. In practice, I find making a fake grid out of flex boxes much more usable. About the only thing grid does easier is letting you place a footer correctly. (Although you gotta make sure you count elements correctly because if you insert an extra element before your grid's footer, it will be rendered after.) reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentGrid also doesn’t break in media print. Neither does flex, but at least you can make a div of flexes, so that div breaks. reply thr33 10 hours agorootparentprevyou can do everything you just mentioned with grid more reliably and by writing significantly less css than the flex method. reply n_plus_1_acc 11 hours agorootparentprevI remember when bootstraps cols were implemented using float. reply karaterobot 14 hours agoparentprevYep, there was a time when it was moderately difficult in certain cases, but it's been a solved problem for the last decade or so. You still hear people acting like centering DIVs in CSS is something like a cross between alchemy and rocket science, which is perhaps indicative that people don't follow CSS with the same attention as other parts of web development—yet they still feel comfortable making these statements! reply parasti 14 hours agoparentprevAnd on top of that, flexbox has been widely supported for over a decade! The comments here are a wild ride. reply vogtb 14 hours agoparentprevThis is super true. Whenever I find myself struggling w/ flexbox it helps to take a step back and solve it one step at a time. Working my way out-to-in, parent-to-child element, and it becomes so much easier.

I don't think I ever wanted things centered relative to anything other than the direct parent, no matter what that is. I am sure some cases need it differently, but I don't see why those should prevent intuitive defaults. > A simple attribute cannot work Can it not work at all or just if one insists on covering 100% of cases on the internet with a single comprehensive option? I'm not an expert in this so I'm not sure, but I've seen a lot of software center items automatically and it worked quite well because they didn't assume by default that I might push the boundaries of design to new heights at any moment. reply mixmastamyk 12 hours agorootparentprevIt worked exactly that way with tables, attributes align and valign: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-td-tag/ reply JacobThreeThree 11 hours agorootparentTables only ever \"worked\" when compared to the poor implementation and browser support of the alternatives of its time.

I thought browsers had proper support for sub-pixels now. reply wruza 8 hours agoparentprevWhat do you do when position isn’t absolute? reply 4death4 5 hours agorootparentThen I use one of the approaches listed. However, I find that usually I want absolute positioning when centering either horizontally or vertically. reply hlammers 8 hours agoparentprevI was kinda surprised that this method wasn't included in the article. While I use flexbox for centering most of the time, I still find myself resorting to the absolute positioning way sometimes. reply cubefox 14 minutes agoprevFor vertical centering, I never understood why you couldn't just give the container a fixed size and then, on the element, set margin-top and margin-bottom to auto. It works like this for horizontal centering. My guess is that the specification treats vertical margins in a weird way. For example, margin-top:50% means 50% of the width, not of the height. I don't know why they decided to do it like that. reply max-throat 15 hours agoprevThe fact that centering a div in CSS basically requires a doctorate is the entire reason I gave up on web dev. reply dbbk 14 hours agoparentIf you think flex centering is the equivalent of \"requires a doctorate\" I'm not surprised you weren't cut out for web dev reply hirvi74 14 hours agorootparentSuch venom.

The point was that some people still think there is nothing wrong with using tables for layout. The guy who started it all would like to have a word with them. reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentprevI like CSS but I'd agree that tables got a bad rap. They were very easy, very effective, and only occasionally turned into a nightmare of nesting that was impossible to maintain My problem with CSS now is that it's gotten too bloated to the point where it's introducing privacy and security risks. I really want an add-on that restricts CSS by default to only a sane subset of features. reply yreg 12 hours agorootparentUsing tables for layouts is an accessibility nightmare. reply progmetaldev 10 hours agorootparentThey're also awful to maintain over time, if you're needing to add new elements and require new columns or cells (and then there's the need to nest tables when using them for layout). I attempted to fix a website by adding closing table cells that were missing, and finally got the page to validate as XHTML Strict and Transitional.

This causes me a lot of issues. reply allannienhuis 14 hours agoparentI'm too lazy/busy to confirm/test this, but providing a new stacking context on the parent by either by adding a position: relative (or whatever) or adding transform: translateZ(0) (or X or Y) avoids the need to specify every parent's height. Someone less lazy than me could confirm :) reply cfj 14 hours agorootparentI'm just as lazy as you, but I just wanted to point out that you can create a new stacking context explicitly with isolation: isolate; reply allannienhuis 4 hours agorootparentoh, great tip - thanks! That's much more explicit. The other approaches have the new stacking context as almost a side effect. reply FooBarWidget 14 hours agoparentprevI solved this a while ago.

Why haven’t these groups come together to make an easy solution to this? What am I missing? reply mhink 14 hours agoparentThey *have* come together. That's why we actually have several options built for purpose and native to CSS these days, as opposed to relying on hacks and Javascript (which was surprisingly common even as recently as 5-6 years ago. The name of this article is more or less a joke, because most people with any experience will recognize that since Flexbox and Grid have become widely available, the answer is generally \"use Flexbox or Grid\". Knowing the nuances of these layout algorithms is table stakes for building UIs that don't feel \"janky\". The problem with designing and implementing application layouts for the Web is that it's such a dynamic medium. You can't ever rely on a particular viewport size, and you generally can't rely on content size either. Like, just as a simple example: build me a page which has a white background and three blue boxes in the middle which contain white text saying \"foo\", \"bar\", and \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\". How big should these boxes be? Should they even be the same size? How should text wrap within them? How should the text itself be aligned within the boxes? When you say the \"middle\", do you mean centered vertically or horizontally? Are they laid out in a row or in a column? What's the expected behavior when the viewport size is too small to accommodate them? Should the boxes themselves wrap in some special way? Should they resize themselves? This isn't even really splitting hairs or anything, it's just sort of the mindset you get into when you start working within a domain that's governed by *constraints* rather than specific sizes. reply JimDabell 14 hours agoparentprevBecause what people mean by “centring” varies depending on context. You are actually talking about a group of several different behaviours and you don’t always want the same one. So you need multiple behaviours, and you need multiple ways of specifying those behaviours. The most obvious example: horizontal and vertical centring are different because our writing system has a specific direction it flows in. You can’t just do the same thing for horizontal as for vertical because text doesn’t work that way. reply hnlmorg 14 hours agorootparentThis problem was solved literally decades ago with .

I’ve been building websites longer than most (since 1994 in fact) and centring in CSS is definitely not as easy as it was with theHTML. Not even close. If it were, there wouldn’t be this entire discussion to begin with. I swear the amount of times topics like this come up and yet a small subset of developers, likely Stockholm syndromed into believing things are great, is ridiculous.

And all browsers implement this using a vendor-specific CSS rule (e.g. text-align: -moz-center). They must be able to do this, because real websites use it, and there is no other way to implement it using CSS. And yet it's not standardized[1], so if you implement it in a new layout engine you're left with reverse-engineering what other browsers do (a classic). [1]: OK, I lied. It is standardized... in the HTML standard. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#align-... Notice how it's not a stylesheet, not a presentational hint, just prose. It's because standard CSS can't do what browsers could since before its invention. reply assimpleaspossi 12 hours agorootparentThe `` element has been obsolete for 20 years and more. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/obsolete.html#non-conformin... reply shiomiru 11 hours agorootparentI mean exactly that it's not obsolete, because there is no standard CSS property that could have obsoleted it. (Even though every browser does have one; it's just vendor-prefixed.) Ok, maybe this will make my point clearer: hello To replicate this in standard CSS:helloOr you can switch out of flow layout: hello Ok, one semantic div less. But why can't I do this? hello If my browser understands the first variation, then getting it to understand the last one is in all likelihood not much effort; it's just substituting properties. The only reason it doesn't, is that the property does not exist in the standard. So you have to use non-semantic centers instead of semantic divs, but that's frowned upon, so you have to use grid layout even though you aren't making a grid, just centered flow. I just wish it were standardized, considering it's already implemented in all browsers (in the forms text-align: -moz/-webkit-center). reply assimpleaspossi 9 hours agorootparentNone of that has anything to do with the fact that the HTML standard--written and edited by all the major browser vendors--has declared theelement as obsolete. reply shiomiru 8 hours agorootparentSorry, but if this is the only thing you were pointing out, then I don't see how your comment is related to mine?was marked obsolete because it's not semantic HTML, and centering stuff is the task of CSS, not HTML. It was not marked obsolete because a block-level text-align-like property would be useless.

She just wanted to learn JavaScript and web development for fun. “I wasn't a programmer, but I often found I was the only remotely technical person in a group,” she explained. “That’s how I ended up building the choir website in the first place.” She settled on using the front-end framework Astro, which was brand new at the time. It had fewer resources for learners than more established frameworks, but she thought following along as the project grew would be a good way to learn. She soon found herself contributing a small piece of code—a configuration file—to the project. Then, as the project grew, Rainsberger became increasingly involved with the community, fielding questions and supporting new Astro users. “I wasn’t the person who knew the most about the inner workings of the project, but I knew how to explain stuff and guide people through the learning process,” she says. “And I knew who to ask when there was something I didn’t know.” Today, Rainsberger is part of Astro’s core maintainer group. But she still isn’t particularly involved in the codebase, even as she’s deepened her web development skills. As the documentation lead, she spends her time helping others learn the ins and outs of Astro. When we think about “contributors” in open source, all too often we think of those who write code, whether that's adding features or fixing bugs. But open source projects are more than just code. Much of the work that goes into open source is the type of work Rainsberger does. “The things you need for a successful open source project overlap with what you need for a successful commercial product,” says Dawn Foster, an open source community manager currently working as director of open source community strategy at VMware. “That includes documentation, localization, marketing, graphic design, testing, community management, and release management.” It’s difficult to overstate how important non-code contributions are to open source. “Even if you write an amazing program, no one will use it if you don’t explain what it does and how to use it,” says Nate Waddington, a developer advocate at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation with a background in design. A very simple project might just need a README, but the more complex the project, the more documentation, tutorials, and support are needed to make the code useful. Easy-to-source documentation boosts productivity by about 50% in both open source and enterprise software projects, according to the 2021 State of the Octoverse report. Graphic design, branding, and outreach, meanwhile, help signal the health and seriousness of a project that other projects or companies might leverage as dependencies. While there are plenty of opportunities for non-technical folks to contribute to open source, non-code contributions aren’t necessarily non-technical. Certain testing, documentation, and support tasks might require deep knowledge of a codebase. As more and more people seek to contribute to open source to advance their careers, give back to the community, or both, it’s important to remember that these non-code contributions are crucial to open source and provide plenty of opportunities to develop technical and non-technical skills alike. Even if you write an amazing program, no one will use it if you don’t explain what it does and how to use it Why YOU should make non-code contributions Adding features or fixing bugs might sound more glamorous than localizing documentation, providing support, or filing reproducible bug reports—especially if your goal is to use open source contributions as a path toward employment. But making non-code contributions can be just as rewarding, as Rainsberger’s experience demonstrates. If you’re interested in technical communications, graphic design, user experience design, or other roles that don’t involve programming, open source provides an opportunity to build a portfolio. However, programmers also benefit from sharpening their non-code skills, particularly in writing and communication. Plus, experience in writing, support, or community organizing can help you pivot into roles like developer relations or product management. There are opportunities for people of any skill level to get involved. “You don’t need a computer science degree, or an English degree for that matter, to write documentation,” Waddington says. “Even if you’re not a strong writer, you have to start somewhere.” Besides, it’s hard to make meaningful code contributions until you have a thorough understanding of a project. “Feature requests are fundamentally a different mindset for contributions,” Winterbloom founder Thea Flowers said in a recent contributor relations Q&A with The ReadME Project. “The other contributions are really like patching up a wall or repainting a fence, but a feature request is like building a new shed in your backyard. You’ve got to really think about it a bit.” Even what appears to be a small bug fix can have big ramifications. We want to hear from you! Join us on GitHub Discussions. “Only five percent of the effort to actually get something shipped is writing the code for it,” Litestream maintainer Ben Johnson said in our article on different levels of openness for contributions. “It’s the years of maintenance afterwards, fixing bugs, writing documentation, making tutorials, and all this other stuff. That’s the hard part.” In an informal social media poll in April, The ReadME Project asked maintainers what type of open source contribution they would want if they had to choose only one type from now on. Although code was the most popular answer, with 62.2% of the vote, more than one-third of respondents would prefer documentation, design, or testing. Mark Saroufim, an AI engineer at Meta who helps maintain PyTorch, recommends reading the documentation for a project you might want to get involved in and fixing any parts that are outdated or broken as a good starting point. Prolific open source maintainer Jordan Harband explained in the Q&A that newcomers are often better at recognizing issues with existing documentation or spotting areas that lack documentation, specifically because they’re not already experts with a particular project. “Any documentation I write will inevitably be tainted by my already knowing how it works,” he said. Likewise, reading and responding to other people’s questions will help you deepen your knowledge, get to know the maintainers, and learn a project’s build process. “It gives you x-ray vision into a project,” Saroufim says. Even after you’ve transitioned to making code contributions, there are plenty of reasons to keep working on the non-code side. “If you don’t want to work on non-code tasks forever, by all means, don’t,” Saroufim says. “But many of the best, most productive engineers at PyTorch are also active in support.” Providing support helps maintainers learn where users struggle and what features users really want and need, and, in turn, develop better software. Sustained community involvement is also a better way to make a name for yourself in open source than one-off code contributions, and there are often more long-term opportunities to help out with a project in non-coding tasks. Rainsberger’s experience is proof of that. Her Chromebook contributions were valuable, but what made her a core contributor was her active involvement in the community. “The relationships and trust you build are important from a career standpoint,” says Foster. “You will stand out more by consistently being helpful in a community’s Slack or Discord or by helping organize events like community meetups.” Providing support helps maintainers learn where users struggle and what features users really want and need, and, in turn, develop better software. Finding and appreciating non-code contributors The importance of non-code contributions is clear, but how can maintainers find people to pitch in? Ideally, contributors will follow Waddington’s advice and jump in without waiting for someone to tell them what to do. However, the opposite advice applies to maintainers: If they want contributions, the best thing to do is to ask people to do specific things. “I search Twitter and if I see someone tweeting about something missing or incorrect in the docs I ask them if they’re interested in fixing it,” said Rainsberger. “It’s a simple way to get the docs fixed and to give people an opportunity to get involved.” Flowers recommends building a community on a chat platform like Discord, Gitter, or Slack to make it easier for people to get involved informally with a project. “It makes people feel less hesitant to ask quick questions,” she said. “A lot of people are intimidated to ask questions on repositories.” Also, people outside a project’s core team might be more willing to pipe up with an answer. Maintainers should also file issues and tag them with “Help Wanted” and, when appropriate, “Good First Issue.” The State of the Octoverse report found that projects with about 25% of their issues marked with the “Help Wanted” tag saw 13% more contributors than those without, and those with 40% of issues tagged as “Good First Issues” saw 21% more new contributors than those without. Projects can also participate in programs like Summer of Code, Hacktoberfest, and Season of Docs. Astro focused specifically on non-code contributions at Hacktoberfest 2022. “It was phenomenal. We had so much activity; it was really nice to help so many people make their first PR to open source,” Rainsberger says. But just asking for help isn’t always enough. Depending on the size and complexity of your project, contributors may need additional onboarding and orientation. Mentorship is perhaps the best way to set contributors up for success. The 2021 State of the Octoverse report found that mentorship increased productivity in open source projects by 46% and tripled the chances of having a healthy culture. “Having a dedicated person who engages with new community members helps them overcome hurdles and stay involved with the project,” Georg Link, co-founder of open source health metrics organization CHAOSS, told The ReadME Project for our article on onboarding contributors. Mentorship is time-consuming and can take maintainers away from other tasks, but the time investment usually pays off in the long run. New contributors can take on increasingly important tasks and even become mentors themselves. It’s also crucial to elevate and appreciate non-code contributors. This not only helps keep current contributors motivated but also helps attract new contributors. “We try to give lots of opportunities for people to feel valued and publicly recognized,” Rainsberger says. Early on, the Astro project required someone to make “significant code contributions” to become a “core contributor.” That language has since changed to include non-code contributions when considering promoting people to core contributor status. Non-code contributors are also included in the project’s other forms of recognition, such as badges that contributors can display on their GitHub profiles to highlight accomplishments within the project. To help ensure everyone gets their fair share of credit, Astro includes detailed instructions on specifying co-authorship on pull requests. Additionally, the GitHub avatar of every contributor is on the first page of the project’s documentation. For a more tangible reward, the project distributes funds raised on Open Collective to contributors once per quarter. It’s time for everyone to recognize the role that documentation, support, and other non-code contributions play in making open source viable. It’s never too late or too early to make your own contributions to your favorite projects. You don’t need to wait for someone to give you something to do, he adds. You can answer questions on chat or in issues without having any formal role in a project.

And I daresay this manual is a major contributor to the usability of the whole project. As a new user of libcurl, I was recently able to quickly implement FTP upload and adapt it to our specific use case thanks to their tutorials and API documentation. I was even made aware of the lack of thread safety in old versions thanks to that same documentation, so I could warn my team that we should update. Documentation is bloody important. Almost as important as the code and the test suite themselves. [1]: https://monocypher.org reply SAI_Peregrinus 17 hours agoparentIMO a big portion of what a good test suite should be is documentation. Tests are examples of things that do and don't work, with some explanation of why. Examples in documentation can (for some doc frameworks & languages) be set up to run as tests, ensuring they stay current and actually work. Tests are machine-readable documentation. reply Just_Harry 15 hours agorootparentThis is something I _really_ like about D. Unit-tests are built into the language, as is comment-based documentation—put those two together and you get unit-tests as documentation examples built into the language; all it takes is to put a documentation comment (which can be blank) right before a `unittest` block after a declaration. E.g. the examples for the D standard-library's `curry` function are just unit-tests: the docs: ; the code:reply hitchstory 14 hours agorootparentI took the same \"docs are tests and tests are docs\" approach with integration testing when I created this library: https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory I realized at some point that a test and a how-to guide can and probably should actually be the same thing - not just for doctests (https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html), but for every kind of test. It's not only 2x quicker to combine writing a test with writing docs, the test part and the docs part reinforce the quality of each other: * Tests are more easily understandable when you attach written context - the kind that is used when generating a readable how-to guide. * How to docs are better if they come attached to a guarantee that they're tested, not out of date and not missing crucial details. * Integration test driven development where how-to docs are created as a side effect is really nice. reply abdullahkhalids 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can put tests in python's class/method docs. They work wonderfully if you put enough examples to cover most inputs/outputs of the function. reply SAI_Peregrinus 8 hours agorootparentYep, also D and Rust have similar things, and likely other languages. I didn't feel it particularly useful to try to list them all, just to point out that tests & docs are two aspects of the same thing. reply rqtwteye 16 hours agorootparentprevI subscribe this to a certain degree but there are limits. Some tests are just too complex to be used as documentation. Sample code is better in such cases. reply ramijames 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is ALWAYS TRUE. Software without good documentation pales in comparison to software with good documentation. https://www.ramijames.com/thoughts/docs-deserve-more-respect reply zilti 16 hours agorootparentprevOh yes, and for languages where that is not directly possible, there are still ways - I implemented libraries for Chicken Scheme in org-mode with org-babel; the examples are simultaneously tests, runnable directly from within the org file, and live next to the code together with the docs. org-babel's tangle and org's export take care of the rest. reply actionfromafar 17 hours agoparentprevMy heart skipped a beat when I saw there are PicoLisp bindings! reply LtWorf 12 hours agoparentprevI opened your link and don't know what it does. reply bo0tzz 12 hours agorootparentIt says what it does in the first sentence on the page. > Monocypher is an easy-to-use crypto library. reply marcellus23 12 hours agorootparentYep, and if you don't know what a crypto library is, the Features list does a very good job enumerating all the things the library lets you do.

They are crucial for open source - documentation, assets, etc. But they can also mess up a project with giving power to non-developers who focus on changes like redoing the UX every release, to the detriment of stability, functionality, adoption, and so on. They also attract busybodies concerned with \"politics\", more so than coding does. It's also a great domain for bikeshedding (as anybody feels like they can do it). reply lolinder 19 hours agoparentYou've clearly touched a nerve, but this article barely talks about UX or political issues at all, it's overwhelmingly about low-recognition work like improving docs, filing good bug reports, and being active in the project's support channels. The people who do the things that the article talks about do not tend to be busybodies because these are tasks that don't get a lot of attention or recognition, which is why this article was written. reply elzbardico 18 hours agoparentprevYes, the usual attack vector for entryists in an open source project is usually through non code contributions. Intensely political people figure this out pretty easily. But, what can we do? I like to believe that those anti-social elements are (very vocal) but a small portion of the universe of non code contributors. Project leaders just need to be a little less naive and keep an eye on this possibility to tackle the problem as soon as it appears. reply lolinder 18 hours agorootparentIs it even really true, though? This feels like the kind of idea that circulates among techies who feel like \"their people\" wouldn't engage in that kind of politicking, even though it's been obvious everywhere I've looked that we're just as capable of making a mess of an organization as anyone else. reply elzbardico 17 hours agorootparentI don't know. You could be right. I've found my share of intensively conniving and political techies too. Even some that were highly competent/skilled but had this passion for politics, and a tribal instinct of building a clique of a bunch of followers steamrolling over everyone else wherever they went. But on the other side, the non-tech infiltration route is also real. reply red-iron-pine 13 hours agorootparentprevperception is reality, and there have been a few high profile cases of people injecting politics into the discussion. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentYes, but the perception seems to be that those people are non-technical people who felt empowered to become involved because the project encouraged non-code contributions like documentation, bug reports, and helping out in the support forum. The reality as far as I've seen is that the people injecting politics into the discussion are developers, not \"normies\". The perception exists because some of us have a stereotype of a developer as someone who's only interested in the technical details of a project, so the people who bring unrelated concerns to the table must be non-technical. reply keybored 11 hours agorootparentHow is bug fixing a non-code contribution? You didn’t say bug reporting. reply lolinder 11 hours agorootparentOops, yes, that was a mistake, I meant bug reporting. Fixed. reply wolverine876 4 hours agorootparentprev> perception is reality How does that apply here? That applies when people act on their perceptions; here we are talking about what the reality is. reply woodruffw 16 hours agorootparentprevWhen people say things like this, the first thing I think of is ncurses' absolutely legendary licensing and social drama[1]. Be warned: reading that page in full will take you at least an hour. To find petty bickering, look no further than most technical contributors. Accusing non-technical people of this sort of thing isn't borne out. [1]: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html reply cvwright 14 hours agorootparentYour story is from 1996 and 1997. Of course all the bickering was between technical people — those were the only people around! reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentIt's just as true today, though. When the Rust mod team resigned en masse in 2021, it was announced by a programmer (the author of ripgrep) [0], and the conflict was with the core team (also programmers). A supermajority of the contributors to open source projects are programmers, so most famous meltdowns are going to be conflicts between programmers, not between programmers and the tiny minority of non-technical contributors. I'm still waiting for anyone to give an example of an open source project meltdown that was triggered by non-technical contributors.

A much simpler, less paranoid explanation is that they get involved and then perceive problems. Some of those problems might even be real! reply asoneth 20 hours agoparentprev> But they can also mess up a project with giving power to non-developers who focus on changes like redoing the UX every release Have you found that a new developer is meaningfully less likely to recommend redoing the UX compared to a new non-developer? Personally my sense is that desire to update the UX is more closely correlated with the \"newness\" than development ability. reply coldtea 19 hours agorootparent>Have you found that a new developer is meaningfully less likely to recommend redoing the UX compared to a new non-developer? Kind of. New developers tend to do some bug fixing here and there, or implementing some small feature, not dictate major changes. And if they do, they're ignored or debated, and that's it. reply lolinder 17 hours agorootparentThat would be overwhelmingly true of most non-developer contributors too: they maybe submit one feature request that gets brushed off and then aren't heard from again. The question isn't whether most members of a given demographic are successful in derailing things or not, the question is if non-developer contributors are disproportionately likely to be disruptive to the project. I don't believe that to be the case, but am open to examples that provide evidence in favor of the claim. reply LunaSea 21 hours agoparentprevCouldn't agree more. This reminds me of the codes of conduct hell from a few years ago. reply beeboobaa 21 hours agorootparentIf nothing else, that while ordeal has shown you can get a job at GitHub even if your only marketable skill is harassing people. reply red-iron-pine 13 hours agorootparentim looking to jump, explain honkey reply zilti 21 hours agorootparentprevThat is an interesting one. \"The internet doesn't forget\", they say, but all the bs and mudslinging around that got basically purged from the internet.

It’s free enterprise. reply coldtea 16 hours agorootparentI, for one, don't believe in the freedom that \"free enterprise\" supposedly affords in theory. I believe in the practical reality, in which some companies/social media/products become near monopolies, and there's always an additional cost to \"not using it\", not just \"chose this or that and get equivalent functionality\". In general, I find your answer not that different than the right wing \"if you don't like it here, just move to another country\". reply indigochill 15 hours agorootparent> \"if you don't like it here, just move to another country\". But that _should_ be easier in the digital world than the physical one. That Github has become such a center of everything _is itself a problem_. Codeberg is one answer to that: they host open source projects and also provide CI to those projects on an as-needed basis (decoupling the service from financial constraints by limiting their audience and therefore their costs to provide this service). Hosting code forges for particular communities is another way (I think SDF does this for theirs?). It's easier today than it ever has been in the past. If we just say \"I have to use the monopoly because it's too expensive not to\" than we're part of the problem. reply ad404b8a372f2b9 19 hours agorootparentprevJust like I'm free not to use Whatsapp, as long as I don't mind not being able to contact most of my family and friends.

Or they could just give mockups, like in Gnome, Mozilla, and elsewhere, and have enough traction within the project to push for them. reply danShumway 13 hours agorootparentWith the amount of hate I see over Gnome's interface designs, if it was true that submitting mockups was enough to force a project to change its direction, Gnome would have a different interface. The fact that Gnome was able to choose a direction they wanted to go and then go in that direction even over the extremely vocal protests of a large portion of the community is if anything proof that you absolutely can reject mockups from community members if you don't want to implement them. Ultimately, the project decides what interface it wants to have. And community members can protest that direction, they can complain that project's priorities are wrong, they can fork things (and Gnome has forks), they can do whatever -- but they lack the ability to force the project to abandon a design that its owners like. That's a good thing about Open Source. The idea that UI designers are somehow hijacking Gnome because they advocated for designs that the org voluntarily implemented... it makes no sense to me at all. Does the org own the project or not, it's their choice. Unless the idea here is that Gnome should have been obligated to accept design critiques from people outside of the project and change their internal designs just because the people proposing changes from outside the project knew a programming language; but that would be a silly thing to say. reply coldtea 11 hours agorootparent>The idea that UI designers are somehow hijacking Gnome because they advocated for designs that the org voluntarily implemented... it makes no sense to me at all.

Well, here's the problem: these people proposing the changes are not outside the project. They are within the project. And their vote is as good as a dev's (and it's easier to gather dozens of them, as it doesn't require skills for doing the much harder and more prolonged dev work). And in orgs with a non-dev bureucracy and management (like Mozilla and Gnome) they can get buy-in from those \"higher ups\" too. And they can also create enough friction and bikeshedding on regular FOSS projects too, as long as those don't have a BDFL and everybody has a voice. reply danShumway 9 hours agorootparent> Well, here's the problem: these people proposing the changes are not outside the project. They are within the project. So what, your issue is that project owners get to decide who they work with? If the people working on UI in Gnome are part of the Gnome project that is not in any way randos coming in and bikeshedding over the UI -- it's a project self-determining what it wants to do. I'm sorry they're organized in a way that you (an outsider to the project) find offensive. Yeah, of course the vote of project members is as good if not better than the votes of people outside of the project because these projects get to set up their own orgs and governance structures and they don't have to justify or prove to anyone outside the project why the people they work with deserve to be there. And that is one of the things that is amazing about Open Source. You can just go do stuff and when somebody else shows up on your Github repo and says, \"the UI designers are ruining your software\" you can tell them to take a hike because they don't get to decide how your project is run. They're not required to consult with you. ---- I don't see what any of this has to do with no-code contributions. Encouraging non-coders to write documentation and tutorials and help with feature suggestions is bad because you have a problem with project management? By the \"higher ups\" I guess you mean the literal orgs behind the projects? You don't need quotation marks for that, those are just called higher-ups, that's how organizations work. It's still the case that the people who build and control Open Source projects can take them in any direction they want regardless of what people outside of the projects want them to do. Of course, Open Source has lots of mechanisms to avoid problems with bad project direction -- notably, forking, which should be hecking easy since all of the people complaining are apparently such excellent programmers. reply elric 20 hours agoparentprev*cough* Thunderbird *cough*.

In the early days of the late-aughts, when Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress were all pretty similar in terms of install base, WordPress was just simpler to start with and become familiar due to its abundant documentation. reply eszed 20 hours agoprev> Flowers recommends building a community on a chat platform like Discord, Gitter, or Slack to make it easier for people to get involved informally with a project. “It makes people feel less hesitant to ask quick questions,” she said. “A lot of people are intimidated to ask questions on repositories.” I have asked questions on repositories, more times than I have fingers. I have created pull requests that fix problems I've had, fewer times than I have fingers. I can think of twice those have yielded positive results: one time I received a clear answer to a question which solved my problem; another time a pull request was rejected with an explanation. (It was a fair enough reason: my change would have broken a different use-case I hadn't considered. I used my code fix locally - on a personal project - until I stopped needing that project.) Far, far, far more often than that I have seen my questions already asked, or pull requests already created, with no answer or merge forthcoming. I'm not intimidated by the process, but have come to think of it (on GitHub, at least) as fairly pointless, and it's been ages since I've bothered. (I've also come to avoid using GitHub projects with a single developer, and /or without a really active and recent update history.) I understand why \"I've made the code public; I don't owe anyone anything else; fork it if you don't like it\" is a prevailing attitude amongst GitHub project creators. I also think it obviates the original premise of GitHub - to create collaborative communities of developers and users - to the platform's detriment. It's not surprising (but still disappointing) that people are looking to other platforms for the community-development (in both senses) that GitHub could, and was intended to, support. reply NoboruWataya 19 hours agoparentGitHub has probably been more successful than any platform at connecting developers, but I think it is ultimately subject to the same limitation as the big social media platforms in that regard: if you are connected with everyone, you aren't really connected with anyone. When someone creates an issue or pull request on your repo, you have no idea about their competence or their intentions. You have no idea if they are trying to sneak in malicious code, or if they are trolling you, or are going to get offended if you suggest changes to their PR, or if they will have the capacity to understand your detailed technical response to their query. In a word, there is no trust. So if it's a side project (maybe one of many) it's often easier to just ignore contributions and treat GitHub as a way to publicly host your code on a \"take it or leave it\" basis. For true collaboration, maybe other, smaller forges where developers are more likely to have something in common would be more useful. reply belval 17 hours agoparentprev> Flowers recommends building a community on a chat platform like Discord, Gitter, or Slack to make it easier for people to get involved informally with a project. Sample size n = 1, but I saw a lot more engagement on my projects when I was hosting mattermost helpdesks for people to join and ask their questions. Unfortunately I had to shut them down because turns out having random individuals ping you on your phone about an issue that is well documented gets very draining. So definitely a double-edged sword. reply georgestephanis 16 hours agorootparentHonestly, public forums, stackexchange, etc also have a huge benefit over something like discord/gitter/slack, in that previously asked questions are indexed by Google -- which is often the first recourse of someone trying to figure something out. If the discussion is sequestered behind an authentication gate, it can't help other folks out down the road. reply giamma 20 hours agoprevI don't know if they are the secret to success, but I agree that non-code contributions are extremely important.

I am in the process of launching a new Open-Source project for Civil/Mechanical/Chemical engineers. In my gut feelings, this software shall be used by at least 10x Engineers compared to the number who may actually help code it. So, there must be a way for those Users to contribute back to the project. Even if it is simply improving the docs. If I use a static site generator such as Hugo to generate the docs (EDIT: user manual in our language), there must be a way for users (not developers) to submit correction/updates to the docs. I can't expect them to create a GitHub issue either, so I have to think about a way to do this. i.e. In this case, non-code contributions are far more important than the actual pull request. reply bigger_cheese 8 hours agoparent> am in the process of launching a new Open-Source project for Civil/Mechanical/Chemical engineers I'm in this group (I'm a Materials/Chem eng). We have recently started using media wiki internally for all sorts of documentation related things it has taken off very quickly. Over the years there has been other solutions pushed onto us like confluence and sharepoint those never really gained any traction. Having plugins enabled (like math equation editor) is important - Engineering documentation involves Math equations.

No accounts or captchas, just mail in the patches. reply Tmpod 8 hours agorootparentThis. An e-mail based workflow is much better for non-developers because you don't really need to create an account and faff around with an unfamilar plaform, it's just e-mail. The issue then becomes using a good local VCS UI and also a good remote UI. I'm not familiar with Guix, but sourcehut, despite not being quite there yet, has lots of potential imo. Side note: Unfortunately, it seems like development has slowed down.

This can come in almost any form. A message on the project's Discord channel. A tweet or toot or other short-form message. A screenshot. A gist. A public GitHub repo, ideally with a descriptive README. A YouTube or TikTok video. Anything like this is SO valuable for a project: 1. It shows people actually using the thing, which is motivational for the developers and also provides social proof to other people considering trying it out 2. It provides feedback. Just seeing what people are building helps show which features matter the most, and often highlights other things like what features were less obvious. 3. It's just nice. Seeing people use my stuff is why I build it. That's motivational again, but I said it twice because it's so important. reply test6554 16 hours agoprevIf you are getting non-code contributions, that likely means you have non-technical people who both understand your project AND find value in it.

Twenty years ago, while using a really cool open source project [written by ESL programmers], I emailed the team and offered my own English revisions to their initial documentation attempts. Even today [without any further contributions], I'm one of ten people in the \"special thanks to\" section of their project, which has 100m+ downloads to date, and has updates from hundreds of contributors. I'm not sure why \"I'm so special\" [to still be thanked], but I do list this under the copyediting section of my resumé [because the software is well-known]. reply Symbiote 12 hours agorootparent> I'm not sure why \"I'm so special\" Perhaps a little cynically, but partly based on similar credits on software I maintain: because the current maintainers aren't quite sure what you did any more, and don't want to cause a problem by removing your name. reply redskyluan 7 hours agoprevAs an open source database Milvus contributor, I am deeply grateful for the contributions brought by all non-code contributors to the project. However, in my view, this is far from sufficient. Without the project maintainers or dedicated documentation developers to operate the official website, you will soon find the documentation filled with a lot of outdated information, misconceptions, and some incorrect understandings. More crucially, if core contributors do not deeply participate and draft the first version of the functional documentation, it is likely to be very difficult to read because it would lack the mental model documents that explain how the authors think about things. In fact, aside from simple user documentation, a good FAQ can help others better understand the design, and this must be the responsibility of the core developers. reply hangonhn 16 hours agoprevWith some years under my belt now working as a software engineer, I've learned that these non-code elements are hugely important in getting people to adopt your work. I used to just code up something and tell my team about it, either through messaging, email, or even a presentation. There would be very little traction. Some time later, someone would mention a problem and I would tell them about my project. Then it may gain some traction. The \"secret\" I've learned is to not only build the project but pave the road so that it's ridiculously easy for someone to adopt it. This means top notch documentations with screenshot and links or scripts that automate the task of setting it up. It probably doubles the work involved but it's way better than coding something up and no one using it. reply Intermernet 19 hours agoprevThere is an inflection point, where a product goes from unknown and used by hard core fans, to becoming known and looking for more users, where documentation is key.

It's definitely at this inflection point and the docs need some love! reply charliebwrites 13 hours agoprevThe last two companies I’ve worked for have had their documentation on GitHub to have PRs made against and I can say first hand how powerful it is to allow users to catch old documentation and just push a change It makes the lives of Tech Writers, PMs, and engineers so much easier, and enables the community around your software to get more involved and feel like they made an impact reply bell-cot 23 hours agoprevLordy, yes. And not just open source. reply wvh 14 hours agoprevI used to be active in a few distributions 20 years ago – when I still had time for that – and I also feel documentation and general news and changelog reporting are absolutely crucial. We can come up with the greatest code and technical solutions; if nobody knows about them, all that work will go unused. Clearly communicating simple facts such as what it is, how it can be used, where a project is going, what its trade-offs are, contributes to the \"friendliness\" factor around a project. I used to be rather critical about the identity groups approach some projects got into – we're all in the same project after all – but truth is that it's very important for open-source software to attract people that don't think of themselves as hardcore hackers because without that more diverse skill set, a project is just a proverbial tree falling in the forest. reply cloudripper 17 hours agoprevI think the community building component is the most interesting here.

If you want it to be popular, and sit around smelling your own farts because of how many GitHub Stars your project has, then all that's great. Absolutely unnecessary to make open source that people will use. Just keep committing, be easy to contact, make it stupid easy for people to contribute, and rapidly iterate on contributions (do not let PRs and issues sit for months or wait months to reply to an e-mail). Mailing lists, chat rooms and forums are all good ways to allow other people to solve problems ad-hoc. Avoid anything that attracts spam. Personally I find \"corporate\" open source very annoying. There's often 3 different websites and the docs are buried somewhere deep. Yeah you have a great mascot and splash page, but I'm an actual developer trying to solve an actual problem. When I do find the docs website, the docs I want aren't even on the website, they're somewhere in the repo. The README doesn't tell me where, though, it's just another splash page that doesn't even link to the docs website.

The reason why Blender is on a trajectory to very slowly take over the industry and Gimp isn't is because Blender has a community of non-coding artists who are on good terms with the dev team and who talk about the product, build tutorials, and generally make it accessible. The shift in how people thought about and talked about Blender is in no small part influenced by people throwing tutorials on Youtube saying \"check out this cool thing I made in Blender, here's how you do it.\" Similarly, the reason why Mastodon is eclipsing other Twitter competitors like BlueSky and why it's more successful than arguably much better federated protocols like Matrix is because a bunch of non-coders showed up on Mastodon and turned it into a community (with all the good and bad that entailed). I have so many issues with ActivityPub, it is not the protocol I would have preferred to win the federation debate. I don't want to badmouth Mastodon, it's a huge achievement and I would in no way do a better job building it -- but my point is Mastodon can have no concept of mobile identities or homeserver separation, and lack support for E2EE, and be lagging on moderation tools, and be arguably not fantastic about handling accidental DOS attacks on smaller instances, and it just does not matter at all, because they got a community to show up that likes them and that is enthusiastic and that helps with all the non-code stuff and actively goes out and evangelizes them and says \"oh, join my instance, I'll show you how to set up filters and who to follow\", and so... that's it, that ends up mattering more; because of that community involvement ActivityPub is now getting federation support from Wordpress and Threads. ---- Getting actual adoption of Open Source products is about more than code. If someone is showing up on the Linux forums and helping randos solve tech problems, that person is contributing just as much as someone who writes code for the kernel. And not just contributing to the person you're replying to, you're also averting a distracting issue on a Github repo, you're making the community feel friendly, you're making someone on the fence think, \"actually, I could give this Linux thing a try because if I get confused even if I feel like I'm being stupid somebody will jump in and be happy that I'm here and will try to help me\". You're taking care of a support issue so that a moderator or another helper or an overworked community manager that has seen hundreds of identical comments no longer needs to worry about it. It is a valuable contribution to help others use Free/Libre software, to write documentation, to be public about your usage of Open Source software and to talk about the things you make with it, to brainstorm ideas and give feedback on features, and even just to cheer on developers, donate money, and to get excited about releases and excited about the things they're doing. Even the bikeshedding that happens on platforms like Mastodon -- while it's good to have tiered systems of feedback that shield developers from getting harassed by thoughtless ideas or suggestions, it also helps Mastodon a lot to have a community of people who are constantly thinking, \"hey, we should do X, we should do Y, Z is an issue we need to address.\" Filtering that into useful feedback is just triaging. Others have pointed out, just documentation alone is a huge boon for getting people to actually use software. But going beyond that, I feel like increasingly I can predict what the health of a project is going to be in a few years based just on, \"is there an enthusiastic community of non-programmers who are participating in the development process?\" reply keepamovin 23 hours agoprevThis was interesting because I never even thought of that.

There's a ton of (as the kids say) alpha in each of the bullet points. I can't say that I practice all or most of these habits, but the points about \"calling your shots\" and \"concrete hypotheses\" resonate. For example, when I add a debugging printf/log, I always ask myself, \"will this output invalidate one or more hypotheses?\" If not, then I need to rethink the problem. reply cybrox 10 hours agoparentAgreed, these are surprisingly on point. The flow of 80/15/5 is what true seniority looks like in my opinion.

It also helps validate some things that less experienced programmers might be doing but aren't sure are the best things. I for example found that some things I seem to be gravitating towards are mentioned, which will hopefully allow me to focus on them and grasp them better in the future. reply FrustratedMonky 14 hours agorootparentI agree. I might be, being miss-interpreted as dismissing this article. They are definitely good points, and doesn't hurt to read them. I think all the points are valid. Maybe I was just contemplating how experts sometimes 'summarize' their knowledge, condense it, but in the process of trying to be succinct, becomes itself un-fathomable, generic. reply codebje 9 hours agorootparentI suspect that the unfathomable nature of condensed knowledge arises from the fact that there is simply no shortcut to expertise. You must earn it through experience. Someone with a similar level of experience to the author may well have the right foundations to draw on such that a condensed expression of an idea resonates well. Others may only get a \"seed pearl\" to help shape how they view their past and future experiences. And some might be able to recognise that there is wisdom there, but not be able to relate it to their own understanding at all. Without any relevant experience, it's just words devoid of much meaning. reply phforms 8 hours agoparentprevMany of these suggestions made me remember my own experiences, some where I intuitively followed them and some where I did not. Reading this write-up made me realize their value and will hopefully remind me that I need to do these things more often. As someone who is not an expert but tries to gain wisdom from past experiences, it helps me to see where my intuitions might have been right or wrong, even if I may not get the point right away. reply bsder 12 hours agoprevYour regular reminder that Kent Beck was part of the Extreme Programming brain trust behind the massive failure that was the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Comprehensive_Compens... Programming advice from him and his cohorts (Ron Jeffries and Martin Fowler) should be regarded with several large grains of salt. reply yura 6 hours agoparent> Near as I can tell the fundamental problem was that the GoldOwner and GoalDonor weren't the same. The customer feeding stories to the team didn't care about the same things as the managers evaluating the team's performance. This is bad, and we know it's bad, but it was masked early because we happened to have a customer who was precisely aligned with the IT managers. The new customers who came on wanted tweaks to the existing system more than they wanted to turn off the next mainframe payroll system.

I finally have some ammo. As a .Net dev, I constantly encounter too many people who think Fowler is a programming prophet. reply matchagaucho 9 hours agoparentprevThese object-oriented \"birth projects\" were all pretty much deemed failures. NeXTStep by Steve Jobs, C3... Yet all these years later, the principles of OOP, and the companies built on them, outlived the politics that tried to squash them in the 90s. reply bsder 6 hours agorootparentOOP is a failure ... looked at through the lens of today. Back then, OOP originally solved a very real problem--optimizing memory usage of bunches of objects that have mostly common behavior with just a few tweaks different from one another. It did pretty well at that at the expense of introducing some extraneous coupling and complexity. And then memory got big and disk became SSD. Now, programmers would rather burn extra memory, avoid pointer chasing (expensive on modern microprocessors), and ditch the extraneous coupling that introduces unnecessary complexity. reply doctor_eval 12 hours agoparentprevI haven’t heard of C3 before, but I’m a big fan of reading about software project failures, and I’m not a fan of every aspect of XP, so I was certainly curious about this. That said, the Wikipedia page neither supports nor refutes your assertion, and Fowler himself discusses C3’s failure here: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/C3.html Fowler refers to notes that don’t seem to be in the Wikipedia entry any more: “In particular the entry in Wikipedia is misleading and incomplete, much of its comments seem to be based on a paper from a determined XP critic whose sources are unclear. Certainly its comments on performance are a misleading interpretation of material in my Refactoring book.” Do you have any other links to this project? The fact that it went live and then reverted to the COBOL version is interesting. reply whstl 11 hours agorootparentThere is some discussion in C2 by the people involved about whether it was a failure or not: http://wiki.c2.com/?HighDisciplineMethodology I believe the characterization of C3 as a \"failure\" is because it wasn't able to deliver the goal (goal was paying 87000 people – it only reached about 9000), and was later discontinued for multiple reasons (some unrelated, like people leaving, the merger with Daimler). The claim that \"XP was banned\" there seems overblown, it seems it's just that \"people at DaimlerChrysler stopped taking terms like Smalltalk, OOP and XP\" (per link above). reply bsder 11 hours agorootparentC3 was, by any measure, an abject failure. It got only the very basics working and then died when it ran into the vast number of unspecified exceptional cases (gee, where have we heard that before ...) that needed to be handled. And then got cancelled and completely reverted. To then use such a failure as a marquee project demonstrating the supposed \"superiority\" of XP is unabashed chutzpah. Now, large IT projects generally fail. So, XP is not wholly to blame. However, the proponents of XP pushed it as superior silver bullet to navigate both the political and technical waters of software projects. The fact that C3 was such a spectacular failure simply demonstrates that XP really wasn't any different than any other methodology being pushed by people with an agenda. reply whstl 9 hours agorootparentI was trying not to make any judgement call, but I agree. To me there are worse things in the story, though: they tried to make User Stories and even customer-driven tests and ended up burning out the only customer that was able to do it. It's not only underwhelming compared to the silver bullet they were selling in conferences and books, but it required some unicorn customer that they couldn't replace.

This is still a legitimate concern today with the \"product owner\" role that a lot of popular Agile processes rely on. In effect the whole premise of having a PO embedded within the team as the authority on requirements that are expected to change at any time means the entire software development process is built around a single human point of failure. reply Scubabear68 10 hours agorootparentprevA lot of the failure of XP was an assumption that all developers develop software the same way, and for all software teams XP’s tenants are optimal. Practices like pair programming and TDD work on some instances, are absolutely terrible in others. The arrogance of the original XP folks was a hard core belief that they had found the silver bullet of software development, and then marketing it ruthlessly. reply lmm 6 hours agorootparentprev> It got only the very basics working and then died when it ran into the vast number of unspecified exceptional cases (gee, where have we heard that before ...) that needed to be handled.

So, XP is not wholly to blame. One could argue that XP achieved a significantly better outcome than the typical project of that size. They didn't cause any big outages, and reached the end result of being cancelled and reverted much more quickly and cheaply than usual. reply wesselbindt 9 hours agorootparentprevThe article by Fowler cited some ancestors up says something along the lines of \"the cancellation of C3 proves that XP is no guarantee for success\". Regardless of whether XP works for everyone or not, that's pretty far from claiming it's a silver bullet. reply bsder 9 hours agorootparentThat's what he says now--it's highly revisionist. All these guys were in the \"If it failed, it wasn't true XP.\" while they were cashing paychecks for promulgating it--Fowler included. reply bsder 11 hours agorootparentprevI suspect I have some cached references, but I would have to go dig a presentation out of my backups. Unfortunately, all parties involved in the C3 project would rather that it be forgotten. As such, it seems that it is going down the memory hole even faster than most Internet things. :( reply Scubabear68 10 hours agoparentprevPerhaps the biggest fail of XP and C3 was the YAGNI philosophy. As it turns out, in many complex domains, you ARE going to need it, so you should factor that into your design sooner rather than later. This is also why many consulting lead projects fail, because the developers do not understand the complexities of the domain. Not everything is a CRUD website. reply matchagaucho 9 hours agorootparentYAGNI is a conscious and iterative task prioritization process. From a Pareto perspective, it just means to focus on the 20% of functionality that provides 80% of the value first. That's not to say the other 80% of requests should be ignored. But instead well documented and groomed in a backlog. reply Scubabear68 9 hours agorootparentIn practice, YAGNI works out exactly how C3 ended up. Your architecture and design ends up myopic and short sighted, and gets overwhelmed by deferring complexity that could have been dealt with adequately early on, it is much harder to retrofit back onto an existing code base. Fowler means it literally. He had examples published on Artima.com years ago where he gives examples of hard coding things left and right and adding better support “only when you absolutely need it”. To be clear I am not arguing for big design up front. I am arguing to keep an eyeball on your roadmap, and that is not only OK to anticipate the future but maybe do some small amount of work to make the future work easier. The fallacy of “You Ain’t Gonna Need It” is that you so very often do, and the developers down the road are cursing out the devs who ignored the future. reply hirvi74 6 hours agorootparent\"You Are Gonna Need It\" is the YANGI I live. I also feel the same about \"premature optimization,\" but that might just be due to my personality. reply randomdata 5 hours agorootparentIf you subscribe to \"You Are Gonna Need It\", how do you ever get around to shipping software if you are always implementing the things that are fun, but unnecessary, and not focusing on the things that are needed to progress? The \"premature optimization\" thing warned against making code hard to read/debug for the sake of performance in areas where performance is unlikely to ever be a concern. If you don't ship software, it is understandable this is isn't much of a problem. Although I'm not sure how applicable that really is today anyway. The tools have changed dramatically. Often you want to make your code as readable/debuggable as possible as that also gives the best chance for the compiler to find the optimizations. These days, if you try to get fancy, you'll probably make the performance worse. reply enterprise_cog 9 hours agorootparentprevYAGNI is about not implementing features until they are needed. It’s not about ignoring the complexities of the domain. You can adhere to the principle while still designing a system that acknowledges the complexities but defers implementation until it is needed. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 9 hours agorootparentI have no horse in this race but I believe what the other poster was saying is that you might not need it but you should still think about it and decide if you should factor it into your designs. YAGNI creates problems. reply randomdata 5 hours agorootparentDevelopers aren't great at sharing nomenclature, but by what seems to be the most common definition, YAGNI refers to not going off and implementing something that is more fun to implement, but isn't needed right away (if ever). Focus on what you actually need to get your project to a desirable state. It doesn't say you should not consider future considerations in your design. In fact, it suggests that you should design your software to be as accommodating as possible, most notably by ensuring testing is core to your design to assist you when the time for change comes. The other poster you refer to and YAGNI seem to be in alignment. reply dre_bot 7 hours agoprevThanks for making me feel dumb. :D reply zabzonk 16 hours agoprevnext [49 more] [flagged] sandofsky 15 hours agoparentThe initial claim to fame of the XP crowd was the C3 project, an attempt to upgrade Chrystler's payroll system to handle Y2K. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Comprehensive_Compens...

From that perspective, programmer cycles are way less important than CPU cycles because every CPU cycle you save has a multiplicative effect depending on how many users you serve.

Educational Psychology Volume 14 - 2023https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945 Handwriting but not typewriting leads to widespread brain connectivity: a high-density EEG study with implications for the classroom F. R. (Ruud) Van der WeelAudrey L. H. Van der Meer* Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway As traditional handwriting is progressively being replaced by digital devices, it is essential to investigate the implications for the human brain. Brain electrical activity was recorded in 36 university students as they were handwriting visually presented words using a digital pen and typewriting the words on a keyboard. Connectivity analyses were performed on EEG data recorded with a 256-channel sensor array. When writing by hand, brain connectivity patterns were far more elaborate than when typewriting on a keyboard, as shown by widespread theta/alpha connectivity coherence patterns between network hubs and nodes in parietal and central brain regions. Existing literature indicates that connectivity patterns in these brain areas and at such frequencies are crucial for memory formation and for encoding new information and, therefore, are beneficial for learning. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal pattern from visual and proprioceptive information obtained through the precisely controlled hand movements when using a pen, contribute extensively to the brain’s connectivity patterns that promote learning. We urge that children, from an early age, must be exposed to handwriting activities in school to establish the neuronal connectivity patterns that provide the brain with optimal conditions for learning. Although it is vital to maintain handwriting practice at school, it is also important to keep up with continuously developing technological advances. Therefore, both teachers and students should be aware of which practice has the best learning effect in what context, for example when taking lecture notes or when writing an essay. Introduction Digital devices are more and more replacing traditional handwriting (Longcamp et al., 2006; Kiefer et al., 2015), and as both writing and reading are becoming increasingly digitized in the classroom, we need to examine the implications of this practice (Mangen and Balsvik, 2016; Patterson and Patterson, 2017). Using a keyboard is now often recommended for young children as it is less demanding and frustrating (Cunningham and Stanovich, 1990; Fears and Lockman, 2018), allowing them to express themselves in written form earlier (Hultin and Westman, 2013). Be that as it may, handwriting training has not only been found to improve spelling accuracy (Cunningham and Stanovich, 1990) and better memory and recall (Longcamp et al., 2006; Smoker et al., 2009; Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014), but also to facilitate letter recognition and understanding (Longcamp et al., 2005, 2008; Li and James, 2016). Such benefits for learning have been reported irrespective of when writing by hand using a traditional pen or pencil or using a digital pen (Osugi et al., 2019). Also, brain research shows that it is not just any motor activity that facilitates learning, but that accurately coordinating the complex hand movements while carefully shaping each letter when using a pen, is crucial (Pei et al., 2021). Apparently, the pen causes different underlying neurological processes that provide the brain with optimal conditions for learning and remembering (Askvik et al., 2020). Recent findings in neuroscience reveal that neural processes are not as localized and static as is commonly believed, but that the brain is organized in a highly dynamic functional manner (Lopes da Silva, 1991; Singer, 1993). Under normal circumstances, several brain systems are continually working together (Buzsáki, 2006), showing an extremely flexible organization with structurally different neural tissue being involved in neural circuits that are only temporarily assembled so as to enable a given task (Edelman and Gally, 2013; Van der Weel et al., 2019). In such a view, neurons can change function entirely when incorporated in different systems (Anderson, 2014). Bullmore and Sporns (2009) refer to this type of flexible organization of the brain as functional connectivity as against structural connectivity. Electroencephalography is well suited to studying brain electrical activity as a function of handwriting and typewriting in the millisecond scale. It permits the investigation of changes in the status of the underlying active networks (Lopes da Silva, 1991) and can reveal the everchanging spatial patterns of activations that are specific to any given task (Pfurtscheller et al., 1996). In particular, studies of cortical oscillations detected with high-density EEG are now considered an indispensable aspect of contemporary systems neuroscience (Fröhlich, 2016). Brain oscillations can be considered as the interplay between the cortex and the thalamus and are generated by changes involved in the control of oscillations in neural networks (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999). The complex interactions and the resulting particular frequencies are thought to reflect distinct cognitive processes (Klimesch et al., 1994; Berens and Horner, 2017). The temporal organization of neuronal firing is crucial as it is assumed to be fundamental when forming long-term memories in the hippocampus (Berens and Horner, 2017). Frequency-specific changes in EEG recordings can be observed as event-related synchronization (ERS) or event-related desynchronization (ERD; Pfurtscheller and Aranibar, 1977; Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999). Spectral analyses are used to detect differences in a given frequency band (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994; Salmelin and Hari, 1994; Klimesch et al., 1996), by calculating the temporal dynamics of EEG oscillations and quantifying event-related amplifications and/or suppressions of rhythms. A recent EEG-study from our lab showed that drawing by hand causes more activity and involves larger areas in the brain as opposed to typing on a keyboard (Van der Meer and Van der Weel, 2017). We concluded that the involvement of fine and intricate hand movements in notetaking, in contrast with pressing keys on a keyboard that all require the same simple finger movement, may be more advantageous for learning (Van der Meer and Van der Weel, 2017). A follow-up study observed event-related synchronized activity in the theta range in both children and students in parietal and central brain regions, but only when writing by hand (Askvik et al., 2020). As these studies have found evidence that writing by hand facilitates learning, the present study further investigated the neurobiological differences related to cursive writing and typewriting in the young adult brain. Specifically, we investigated how the various brain regions interconnect via neural networks when writing by hand as opposed to typing on a keyboard using frequency modulation and the latest in brain connectivity analysis (c.f., Solomon et al., 2017). Methods Participants Forty university students in their early twenties took part in the study at the Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). HD EEG data from 36 students were of good enough quality and sufficiently artifact-free to be included in the analyses. The data from 12 adult participants were already used in analyses in the time-frequency domain (Askvik et al., 2020). The present study performed a brain connectivity analysis to investigate the underlying neural networks involved in tasks of handwriting and typewriting. Participants were mostly students and were recruited at the university campus. They received a $15 cinema ticket for taking part. To avoid crossover effects between the two hemispheres, only right-handed participants were included, as determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). Allowing the use of (the fingers of) both hands would cause many unforeseen effects on the brain, which would make it hard to interpret the results. Participants gave their informed written consent, and it was made clear that they could withdraw from the experiment at any time without consequences. The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Ethics (Central Norway) approved the study. Experimental stimuli and EEG data acquisition E-prime 2.0 was used to individually display 15 different Pictionary words on a Microsoft Surface Studio. The participants used a digital pen to write in cursive by hand directly on the touchscreen, and a keyboard to typewrite the presented words. The experiment comprised a total of 30 trials, where each word appeared in two different conditions, presented in a randomized order. For each trial, participants were instructed to either (a) write in cursive with their right hand the presented word with a digital pen directly on the screen, or (b) type the presented word using the right index finger on the keyboard. Before each trial, the instruction write or type appeared before one of the target words appeared, and the participants were given 25 s to either write by hand or type the word multiple times, separated by a space. EEG data were recorded only during the first 5 s of each trial. To prevent artifacts produced by head and eye movements caused by shifting gaze between the screen and the keyboard, typed words did not appear on the screen while the participant was typewriting. The writings produced by the participants (see Figure 1 for example) were stored for offline analyses. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Task design, behavioral performance, and sequence of the connectivity analyses. Visually presented words were either written by hand with a digital pen or typed on a keyboard while participants were wearing a 256-channel sensor array. EEG recordings were analyzed in terms of their functional connectivity, resulting in detailed network measures. A Geodesic Sensor Net (GSN; Tucker et al., 1994) with 256 evenly distributed electrodes was used to record EEG activity from the participant’s scalp at 500 Hz. The signals were amplified using a high-input EGI amplifier (Picton et al., 2000). Procedure On arrival in the lab, a consent form with all necessary information was given to the participants to sign. While the participant completed the handedness test, an appropriately sized net was soaked in a saline electrolyte for 15 min to optimize electrical conductivity. The participant was sitting comfortably in an adjustable chair in front of a table. The screen was placed on the table as closely as possible to the participant. A keyboard was also placed in a preferred position for the participant, and a digital pen was used for writing on the touchscreen. A pre-test was completed before the experiment started, where one of the experimenters was present in the room with the participant. Brain data pre-analyses Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA version 7.0) research software and BESA Connectivity (version 1.0) were used to analyze the EEG data. Epoch and filter settings were the same as in Askvik et al. (2020). Channels contaminated by movement artifacts were either removed or interpolated using spherical spline interpolation (Perrin et al., 1989; Picton et al., 2000). Up to 10% of channels could be defined as bad. Artifact correction was applied using manual and semi-automatic artifact correction with fitting spatial filters (Berg and Scherg, 1994; Ille et al., 2002; Fujioka et al., 2011). The mean number of accepted trials out of 15 was 14.1 (SD = 1.1) for handwriting and 13.3 (SD = 1.3) for typewriting. To analyze oscillatory brain activity, a time-frequency analysis in brain space was then performed on accepted trials, see Askvik et al. (2020) for details. Optimal separation of brain activity was achieved using source montages derived from a multiple source model where waveforms separated different brain activities (Scherg and Berg, 1991). Using this procedure, the time-frequency content of different brain regions can be separated even if their activities severely overlap at the surface of the scalp (Hoechstetter et al., 2004). Then, the connectivity measure of Coherence was applied, resulting in a symmetric connectivity matrix with the upper and lower triangular matrix showing pairwise clusters symmetrical to the diagonal. Statistical analyses Probability of significance in connectivity values was tested with BESA Statistics 2.0, where connectivity measures for all participants were computed and the significant connectivity regions were used as guides in finding the extent of connectivity between the two experimental conditions of writing and typing. A combination of permutation tests and data clustering was employed. Permutation tests were applied to each set of time samples belonging to one frequency bin (Simes, 1986). Data clusters that showed a significant effect between conditions were assigned initial cluster values. Using within-group ANOVA’s, these initial cluster values were passed through permutation and assigned new clusters so that the significance of the initial cluster could be determined. A Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. As in Askvik et al. (2020), cluster alpha, the significance level for building clusters in time and/or frequency, was set at 0.01 and the number of permutations was set at 10.000. Low- and high cut-offs for frequency were kept at 2 Hz and 60 Hz respectively, and epochs were set from −250 to 4,500 ms. Results High-density EEGs were recorded during the experimental handwriting and typing conditions. Artifacts were removed from the raw EEG recordings, then the inverse problem was solved by using a 4-shell ellipsoidal head model to analyze the brain regions of interest. The time series of the reconstructed sources were obtained and transformed into the frequency domain using complex demodulation. The functional connectivity between the reconstructed sources was computed using the coherence method. A high-resolution functional connectivity matrix was obtained, and the corresponding functional brain network was visualized. Network measures were then extracted from the network (Figure 1). A time-frequency display is shown for three important brain regions in Figure 2 where the power/amplitude for each time is normalized to the mean power/amplitude of the baseline epoch for that frequency. The x-axis shows the time relative to the event, the y-axis shows the frequencies. The intensities are displayed as a color-coded plot. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Grand average coherence results. Displayed are only three selected connectivity areas of interest for the two experimental conditions handwriting and typewriting (left panels), together with the difference in coherence between writing and typing and their permutation results (right panels). Connectivity areas of large significant difference between handwriting and typewriting included brain regions CR-PM (central right-parietal midline, top two panels on the left) and CL-PM (central left-parietal midline, middle two panels on the left), as well as CM-CR (central midline-central right, bottom two panels on the left), in frequencies ranging from theta (2 Hz) and up to gamma (60 Hz). The x-axes display the time interval from baseline to 4,500 ms of recordings of the trial. The signal magnitude reflects the estimated neural connectivity strength between the various brain areas during the experimental conditions compared to baseline activity (−250 to 0 ms). Positive connectivity is shown as (shades of) red-colored contours in handwriting/typewriting plots (panels on the left) and difference plots between handwriting and typewriting/permutation results (panels on the right). Positive connectivity is significantly more prominent in lower frequencies (theta 3.5–7.5 Hz and alpha 8–12.5) for handwriting (0 ≤ p  30 Hz) oscillations (Canolty et al., 2006; Halgren et al., 2018). In general, this theta-to-gamma cross-frequency coupling can be linked to gamma networks desynchronizing and theta networks synchronizing during encoding, retrieval, and episodic memory formation (Burke et al., 2013). Others have suggested that theta connectivity activity (see Figure 3) is positively correlated with a brain region’s gamma power, suggesting a potent low-frequency mechanism for communication between brain regions (Solomon et al., 2017). Exploring these interactions may disclose the relationship between a brain region’s functional connectivity and local processing. Our results reflect such a low-frequency mechanism for interregional communication. Present findings of theta synchrony for handwriting suggest that low-frequency connections support the integration of information during memory formation, and follow from earlier studies that have reported low-frequency entrainment to be essential to cognition (Solomon et al., 2017). The importance of handwriting practice in a learning environment Handwriting requires fine motor control over the fingers, and it forces students to pay attention to what they are doing. Typing, on the other hand, requires mechanical and repetitive movements that trade awareness for speed. Our results reveal that whenever handwriting movements are included as a learning strategy, more of the brain gets stimulated, resulting in the formation of more complex neural network connectivity. It appears that the movements related to typewriting do not activate these connectivity networks the same way that handwriting does. The concurrent spatiotemporal pattern from vision, motor commands, and proprioceptive feedback provided through fine hand and finger movements, is lacking in typewriting, where only a simple key press is required to produce the entire wanted form (Longcamp et al., 2006; James, 2010; Vinci-Booher et al., 2016, 2021). In the present study, participants only used their right index finger for typing to prevent undesired crossover effects between the two hemispheres. Thus, the ongoing substitution of handwriting by typewriting in almost every educational setting may seem somewhat misguided as it could affect the learning process in a negative way (Alonso, 2015; Mangen and Balsvik, 2016; Arnold et al., 2017). The present findings suggest that the intricate and precisely controlled handwriting movements have a beneficial impact on the brain’s connectivity patterns related to learning and remembering. The present study did not find evidence of such positive activation patterns when using a keyboard. Even though maintaining handwriting practice in school is crucial, it is also important to keep up in the ever-developing digital world. Children should receive handwriting training at school to learn to write by hand successfully, and, at the same time learn to use a keyboard, depending on the task at hand. The present study shows that the neural connectivity patterns underlying handwriting and typewriting are distinctly different. Hence, being aware of when to write by hand or use a digital device is crucial, whether it is to take lecture notes to learn new concepts or to write longer essays.

Religiously refused type notes. Handwriting only. Carried notebooks everywhere, the only person in a meeting handwriting notes. Could never find anything again long after I wrote it, or took way too long to look it up. Idiotically transcribing my notes into emails to send off as meeting notes. Switched to typing everything, even stream-of-consciousness stuff for myself, a couple years ago and would never want to go back. Feel quite foolish for falling for this for so long. reply anigbrowl 4 hours agoparentReligiously refused type notes I've never heard anyone suggest you should only hand write. I type most of the time, but use handwriting whenever I need to learn something or absorb a lot of information at once. It's not an effective filing/information retrieval system, it's an effective brain training system. reply noufalibrahim 4 hours agorootparentExactly. I use digital to keep notes (e.g. meeting minutes) which I need to refer to and lookup regularly. I use a notebook to write stuff down while studying. I don't always refer back to them. Especially not after I've finished studying the topic but the process ingrains the ideas into my head in a way that typing can't. I also draw diagrams and things to illustrate ideas which further help retention. reply adityaathalye 3 hours agorootparentDitto. Some notes are evergreen though. I still have the single page of notes I made during your session on building web apps. Specifically, the dev setup necessary to stand up \"Something that will last on the public Internet\". And --- you can't make this s*#% up --- that was twelve years to the day (I just checked); 14 Feb 2012. As it turns out, that page is still entirely relevant, and I'm still working on it. [Insert :sweat-smile: emoji]. Back to hand writing; Too late in life I realised its value. I spent all my school and college life absolutely hating it --- writing was too hard. Now I use it when I really need to pay attention to detail. It compels me to slow down and that is how I absorb material better. Further, I realized it is most useful when I am reading / thinking on my own, whereas live classroom note-taking disconnects me from the topic. So now I just listen through live lectures and only jot down keywords at points of confusion and/or insight. This applies to code too. From time to time, for difficult topics, I will hand-copy code from textbook examples, and also hand-evaluate them on paper before typing the thing into the computer to see if it works. Even if I am following along by typing directly in my Emacs, I always type out any demo / sample code; never copy-pasting. Some of the mechanics remain the same; i.e. slow down, breathe, and pay attention to detail. reply noufalibrahim 3 hours agorootparentI'm flattered. :) reply loneranger_11x 2 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely this \"it's an effective brain training system.\" Apart from helping with faster memorisation, I have noticed that writing a problem down / solving on paper improves problem solving significantly. I always diagram out the problem & solution on paper whenever i get stuck. reply crq-yml 5 hours agoparentprevThe lesson I've taken from learning drawing is that the observation accomplished by slowing down is different from the one made when you speed up. If you read, for example, Kimon Nicolaides, who was writing before any of the modern research on handwritten vs typed, he encourages students to progress to slower and slower contour drawings(outlines drawn without looking at your paper). The reason to use this approach is because it makes drawing more linguistic in nature: you \"read\" the line and instruct your hand to move slightly in a direction. You can't look back and check, so you have to know by feel how much you moved. Repeating this makes you extremely aware of tiny differences between lines, so you end up with good control over proportions as a result. Of course, you could get around this study and use a method like tracing, and get a very detailed outline. But then you wouldn't develop any awareness of what you're looking at. So when you go slow and engage more senses and muscles, you aren't taking \"better notes\", you're making your brain linger on the content longer and in more depth. It's borderline useless if it's a business meeting that you're notetaking, but it's also potentially very helpful for developing the language of shapes and lines, math symbols, molecular diagrams, etc. A lot of study recommendations now say, \"take the notes twice\". Once in lecture, just letting your hand move without understanding and reducing anything that's lengthy and repetitive to a shorthand symbol. And then a second time when you are at home, allowing yourself to go slowly and develop more comprehension as a mode of study. reply tomtheelder 5 hours agoparentprevI did sort of the opposite. Used to do all typed, now I do both. I make a distinction between notes, which are ephemeral and for memory and quick reminders, and documentation, which is for long term reference. Notes are on paper, documentation is on my computer. I find it's actually a really helpful distinction to make at time of recording. reply quectophoton 15 minutes agorootparentSame. For years I did everything digitally. I didn't do anything handwritten. The only exception was to put my handwritten signature on some document. That's the only handwritten thing I did for literal years, if not a decade. What made me change my mind was (1) noticing that my digital notes were usually buried under several layers of backups of tarballs of backups of tarballs of backups so it was getting inconvenient because I have multiple devices and don't want to set up sync for reasons. And then (2) there was this notebook from fscking high school that has somehow survived everything I've been through up until now, mocking me with all its perfectly preserved information that has lived more than my oldest device. Not useful information, mind you. But just the fact that it's still there, conveniently at hand, accessible in less time than it would take me to search my unorganized mess of backups. Something clicked in me around last year, and realized that I could use notebooks for small things that I might want to reference in the future. Like some useful commands, ideas for things to improve, and small things like that. So now I treat notes on my phone and computer as ephemeral, even if they might still exist in a nested backup somewhere. Haven't regretted it so far. Yes, I could improve how I organize my backups, but I won't. For reasons that I'm fully aware don't make sense to others. It basically boils down to (1) it's a back up, touch it as little as possible; and (2) whenever I change devices (e.g. because hardware upgrades), I usually want to start afresh because I no longer like the old way I organized things, while I also don't want to bring my old notes and re-organize them in the new way I like now. But only loose-leaf notebooks work for me. I can't use more \"permanent\" notebooks because I still want to be able to move stuff around somewhat. reply sircastor 6 hours agoparentprevAdjacent, but I found my journal writing really took off after I switched to typing it.

I could also go back during downtime and rearrange text and diagrams, rewrite mistakes cleanly, and erase doodles (or move them).

Stenography or gregg shorthand can have you hand writing at 60-80 WPM depending on how good you are.

For what it's worth, I can't handwrite fast enough to follow my thoughts, and therefore I make errors. Typing gives me no such problems. But the other thing is - as soon as I start (or started, back when I was a pupil/student) taking notes, I stop learning. Everybody always insisted that \"you have to take notes!\", so I tried that sometimes - and it was a disaster. Didn't learn. Had to go over the notes and trying to learn from that. Not good at all. When I didn't take notes I could focus 100% on what was shown and said, and I learned it. I understood it, to the extent that there was nothing to remember (just like you don't have to remember that an apple will fall, if given the chance). So, when class was over, I understood. Easy on the brain. Obviously there are equations and pure facts. Those you should simply look up when needed. That's how we were thought in my college anyway - learn how to find what you need, when you need it. For other things - not attending classes I mean - I most definitely prefer using a keyboard (designs, thoughts about designs etc). Handwriting would be the worst for this. TL;DR - my own experience absolutely tells me that typing is at least as good, probably much better, than handwriting, and it's all a red herring anyway because taking notes is detrimental to deep understanding. Keep that to the absolute minimum, and it can be useful, but only then. And for that, it makes no difference what writing method you use. reply kaashif 12 minutes agorootparent> Obviously there are equations and pure facts. Those you should simply look up when needed. In math, at least, part of the difficulty of higher level problem solving is that you simply need to have a large number of definitions and theorems memorised to be able to do anything interesting or difficult. And you need to have seen (and remember!) examples of things. This lets you reach a higher level of thinking where your intuition about what is and isn't true is much better. \"Look at up when you need it\" doesn't work if you don't know what you need.

In the heyday of handwritten notes it wasn't so different from how we organize files on computers today. After all where do we think those common fields came from? Timestamps, data blocks, pages, tags/keywords, etc. Notes are front-to-back and empty space on pages is minimal (especially pocket notebooks). Regions of the pages are broken into numbered blocks. Index is written back-to-front with each entry containing at least a timestamp and block number. Keywords, if you can fit them, greatly enhances searchability. I'd love to know of any books written about this topic. reply throwanem 5 hours agorootparentSo would I. A regular topic-to-page-number index has served for about 1500 pages of work notes since ~2018, but my personal journal's quite a bit longer and I lacked the foresight to index that from the start. It's not that I mind an excuse to reread in detail, but I'd like to begin as I mean to go on and I just haven't come up with a way to do it that looks maintainable. reply sublinear 5 hours agorootparentMy indexes are probably a bit harder to read than topic-to-page. I don't group anything when I'm writing and just stick to a more or less consistent set of general keywords per entry. Each index entry is its own numbered row. Index entries may need their own numbers so I can come back later to group. I may not even index if I'm really rushed until later as long as I mark my regions I can index it all later. Not hard to count them up. An example of an index entry: \"56 2024-02-13@22:30 39.1 hn\" where the format is: \". \" I would have to linearly search if I haven't yet updated my groups in a meta index that spans notebooks e.g. \"showerthoughts: 3.30.3 9.42.1 10.3.2 ... \" where the format is .. or more concisely . I've done both before. I prefer the latter when my index has lots of columns that are more helpful (such as bigger notebooks and I always label my columns so I don't confuse myself because not all my notebooks are the same format depending on size). There's always time for indexing and metaindexing later and I find it relaxing. Sort of like washing the dishes. It's a discipline thing, but doesn't have to be perfect. If I had a bunch of old unindexed books I'd start by just broadly labeling the books first (mostly/all school, mostly/all work, mostly/all personal, etc.) and then lazily drill down into pages and regions and keywords as I actually need the info. Just as long as I didn't waste the effort I took to find things the hard way and be sure to index it's better than no index at all... wabi-sabi and all that. Also worth pointing out I don't have separate books for topics. Fuck that it's going on whatever paper I've got on hand and I've even stuck loose pages into books later. As long as the actual content has matching numbers on it (in the corner) the index will keep track. I number it according to where I'm gonna stick it or just n+1 non-loose soon-to-no-longer-be-blank pages/regions. I truly treat paper like disk space and write whatever whenever. It really freed me to think that way. If the index is lost it's not unrecoverable either, just tedious. Pretty sure I picked up the habit of decimal numbering in like the 3rd grade. I had teachers whose assignments were like that: . i.e. \"Did you turn in homework 5.1 through 7.15? No?! You're going to the office if you can't sit in the hall to finish it by the end of class!\" Thought all teachers were like that. reply the-mitr 5 hours agoprevFor young children the problem of writing with hand is twofold. First there is not enough motor control, children spend anywhere between 2-4 years to learn \"good\" handwriting. Some never get this even as adults. The physical strain of writing with hand is so much that there is no scope for reviewing or editing it, making it better. In fact it is given as a punishment \"write this 100 times!\". As adults we typically use typed stuff which we can edit, review and rewrite with much ease using word/text processors. This allows cognitive as well as physical affordance for the users. Now young children, by forcing them to handwrite, are denied both these affordances. Typing allows children to overcome the physical aspect of typing and focus on the content. I have had first graders touch-type in both Devanagari and Roman scripts just with 3-4 months of accessing the One Laptop Per Child. This immensely increased their vocabulary as well as expressiveness. When asked to handwrite the same, they would struggle even to construct simple sentences. Handwriting is a technology which was crucial in the past because we did not have a better alternative. Now that we have better alternatives they should be promoted and used. Studies like these muddy the waters. Did the authors of the study themselves only used handwriting to do this study themselves because it is beneficial ? Or they did use typing on a computer? reply magicalhippo 5 hours agoparent> The physical strain of writing with hand is so much As a teacher my grandfather had a special fondness for teaching handwriting. He read literature on it and conducted his own experiments using his pupils, trying to figure out what worked and what didn't. One of the things I recall vividly is him explaining to me as I started school, how it was vastly beneficial to use thick pencils when first learning to write by hand. He gave me, as he gave his students, a pencil he preferred which as I recall had a diameter about 1.5x a regular pencil. It was also slightly softer, around 2B. As I recall his explanation was that the larger pencil required less motor skill precision, which lead to more relaxed fingers hence reduced strain. The softer graphite also required less pressure, again reducing strain. As I recall he had found the reduction in strain really helped kids get comfortable with writing by hand. reply animal_spirits 4 hours agorootparentI remember as a kid I also had bigger pencils.

As a seemingly overly visual thinker the aspect of making several small decisions about how to layout what I'm writing down by hand also seems to play a huge role in that. I have to make positioning and thereby spacing and sizing decisions, choose the color, as well as making decisions on in what style (caps, cursive, script) I write each letter. I can easily use graphical elements like lines, arrows, boxes, etc. Anything created digitally by primarily typing will always have a more dynamic and flowing nature, while following the linearity of the typed sequence of characters. It takes away a lot of the decisions that I have to make when laying out a handwritten note.

Here's an interesting quote from \"How to learn mathematics - The asterisk method\"[0] around that: > Copying material by hand is important because this forces the ideas to go through the mind. The mind is on the path between the eyes and the hands. So when you copy something, it must go through your mind! For me this is definitely true. Maybe it's like that because when I was growing up we still didn't have smartphones, tablets and widespread computer use at schools and everything was written on paper with a pen/pencil. Most children and young people today probably don't use such tools as much as we did? With that said, I do believe there's something very real in the tactile and spatial feeling of writing on paper that does help learning and greatly improves memorising information. For myself it is definitely true. Maybe for a child today that would be an alien feeling? No idea. I'd be curious to read an actual research on something like this. [0]:http://www.geometry.org/tex/conc/mathlearn.html reply contravariant 8 hours agoparentThat quote doesn't quite explain the difference between writing and typing. Both use your hands after all. What probably makes the most difference between the two is thinking about what you are writing. No matter how. Typing is likely to have the same effect provided you're not simply blindly copying stuff. A more powerful effect that you hint at is the fact that writing by hand transfers the information to a physical location. You remove a layer of abstraction between your memory and what you've written down (yes we try to tie virtual stuff to a 'location' as well, but quite a lot of problems can be explained by people struggling with that abstraction). reply _hao 8 hours agorootparent> That quote doesn't quite explain the difference between writing and typing. Both use your hands after all. True. Although the article is about writing on paper. I'm a pretty good touch typist and years of Vim have made me efficient with the keyboard. My typing is much faster than my writing. I'd say that even if I am thinking deeply about a subject, if I'm copying the text via typing, it I'll be a lot faster than writing. On the other hand writing gives me the opportunity to slow down. Maybe you're right that both should work equally if I'm invested mentally in the material, but then I'll have the internal pressure to type faster which might hurt that. As a physical motion typing is rather static when compared to writing, so I do believe an actual difference exists. reply jwells89 8 hours agorootparentThe speed difference between the two has been a point of friction for me in a couple of different scenarios. It was something of a problem in university. While I’m not a particularly slow writer, I’m not a fast one either and as such it was often a struggle to keep up with what the professor was saying and putting up on the chalkboard when taking notes. Trying to summarize and write succinctly helped some but I’d still sometimes end up far enough behind that I ran out of mental “buffer” to summarize in which would lead to rote copying, making things even worse. All in all I regret not picking up a laptop of some kind for those years, because even 15 years ago I was much faster at typing. These days when I write notes for studying the slowness isn’t an active problem, but more of a persistent irritation stemming from how much time is being spent that could be going elsewhere instead. This may just be an artifact of not writing often enough though. reply 8note 7 hours agorootparentI think if I was to do another university course, I'd just point a camera at the prof/white board for whatever they're talking about/writing, and then write down a much smaller set of things I'm interpreting for what they're talking about. Quickly retyping/rewriting what they're saying never got me any benefit, though that was mech eng courses where nothing the lecturer says matters at all compared to practicing the math. reply nottorp 48 minutes agorootparentI've had success in a lecture situation by printing the slides beforehand with huge ass margins and then taking notes on said margins while the prof was talking. That does require the lecture to have slides that are given to the students before the lecture though... reply 8note 7 hours agorootparentprevTyping doesn't have haptic feedback for a lot of things. There's a feeling to drawing a really thick box circle around some text reply iisan7 5 hours agoprevTaking notes is compression of facts or ideas that are \"full size\" in the mind at the moment of reception. More fidelity when typing, lower compression ratio, and thus better for comprehensive reference; a personalized textbook. Handwriting is intensive, slow, but potentially powerful compression that is much more lossy but capable of transmitting more bits of important information per page. Tradeoffs can be minimized by the ability to graph and edit page layout creatively while typing. reply math_dandy 8 hours agoprevI’m not convinced you can draw any legitimate conclusions about learning, cognition, memory, etc. from EEG activity. reply Fervicus 7 hours agoprevI want to write on paper more often, but one thing that keeps me from doing that is the feeling of a loss of privacy.

Practicing handwriting as a child is certainly useful for developing fine control of hand movements, but practicing other similar activities, like drawing, carving etc. might be the same or even better. I believe that since the beginning it may be better to use typewriting for doing useful work, but practicing in parallel calligraphy may be as useful as practicing various sports, for developing the ability of doing delicate manual work, like reworking a prototype electronic device. reply animal_spirits 5 hours agoprevFor me, writing with pen and paper provides my brain a physical anchor point, a real idea stored in time and space. I find much more connection to my writings when I know where it exists in a physical space, and where I was in a physical space when I wrote it. Digital doesn’t have that anchor point for me, it just goes “up in the cloud”, far and away where the sprites and fairies live. My most profound personal growth happened because of writing with pen, being able to diagram and have the flexibility of 2d space on a paper rather than 1d ish space on a word processor. That doesn’t mean I keep everything written down on paper, though. Usually just journals. Also I find that because writing is slower than the brain it forces me to summarize my thoughts into less words, reducing the informational complexity… making it succinct and understandable reply eviks 5 hours agoprevTo get more brain activity, you can also talk and dance during handwriting, but that extra effort will be detrimental for your memory Just like in the other HN link on the supposed benefits of handwriting where the only benefit was it was too slow to follow the lecture, so students had to think more to staircase, and summarizing is beneficial reply httpz 6 hours agoprevGreek philosopher Plato argued, writing implants forgetfulness.

They specifically look for people who can drive a vehicle while holding a conversation and monitoring several screens. Being chased by a lion would certainly focus the parts of the brain covering perception, balance and coordination. And learning to control one's panic responce is essential cognitive development imho. My point is that essentially any complex activity is a learning experience, a time of increased brain activity. reply mewpmewp2 7 hours agorootparentprevHow would we know that memory formation is related to the subject at hand and not how to physically write? reply hot_gril 8 hours agoparentprevThere's value in thinking about the topic you're trying to learn, while you're learning it. When I was in college, I handwrote my notes, then I switched to typing, then I switched to no notes. Just paid close attention in lecture and thought about the topic during any pauses in talking. Worked wonders. Part of this relied on the professors distributing lecture slides afterwards, which they always did. Helped jog my memory later and remind me of what to study for the final. reply chongli 7 hours agorootparentI tried handwriting notes several times in my math classes. It did not work well. I am not a fast or neat writer, so it was always a desperate struggle to keep up. Many professors preferred not to distribute any notes or slides, and loved to lecture on the board at lightning speed (writing and erasing at least a dozen boards worth of material in 50 minutes). When I switched to typing my notes in LaTeX (using vim) it made all the difference. I could actually keep up with the professor and think about what they were saying without getting hopelessly behind on the proof. The strategy of only writing down the important details that everyone advocates does not work very well in math. I can't know what the important details are until days or even weeks after the lecture, when I've had enough time to digest and work through the material while completing the assigned problems. Of course, this is much more true at the beginning of a course (when I've had no prior exposure to the topic) than it is at the end. reply hot_gril 7 hours agorootparentI took math LaTeX notes in Vim too. Once I got past the learning curve, it was much faster than writing just because of the ability to copy-paste a proof line. It was even an ok form of scratch space for solving problems, though pencil+paper was usually best. But I didn't take enough math classes to really see if it'd help, and in comp sci classes it didn't. reply chongli 6 hours agorootparentI was a math major and I just kept using LaTeX + vim for my whole degree. I got better and better at it and used snippets as well as wrote my own TeX macros to save tons of time. I went back and forth between pencil and paper and LaTeX for assignment work. For some courses the proofs were fairly short so it was easy enough to work on paper. For others, the proofs could get several pages long and small mistakes could lead to lots of erasing. It doesn't take very much erasing/rewriting to annoy me enough to switch over to LaTeX. I can't think of a bigger waste of time than erasing and/or rewriting half a page of material because of some mistake. reply hot_gril 4 hours agorootparentYeah, avoiding erasing was a big part too. Forgot how annoying that was. reply Sai_ 6 hours agorootparentprevWould be interesting if someone made a hardware device to be placed in classrooms which took periodic photos of the board and transcribed it into searchable text using an LLM. reply chongli 6 hours agorootparentI have taken photos of the board and I've seen lots of classmates do it as well. I had one prof who absolutely forbid any photos in class, even if they were just of the notes on the board. I saw one student defy him and take photos anyway. After class he sprinted over to that student and demanded to see his ID, which he photographed and then left. The poor student followed him all the way out of the room and down the hall, begging not to be reported to the associate dean's office! reply zamadatix 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is definitely a quality balance to be had between taking notes and understanding, particularly true if you know you aren't going to go back and put in the proper time to study the notes you made afterward. For an extreme example I had a calculus class where your notes were graded but if you wanted an A you pretty much had to write the entire book section set by hand. It resulted in one of the worst retention rates I had of any class because it was a mad dash to write everything down to get the A and then you had to go back and spend time trying to think about what you just wrote. On the other hand in another calculus class notes weren't graded and I ended up with basically 1 sheet (front/back) with a few notes on things I didn't get 100% or wanted to remind myself of later and then spent 10 minutes outside of class reviewing those to great success. reply peterleiser 7 hours agorootparentMy wife and I have never heard of being graded on your notes.

    "originBody": "Nvidia/ Tech/ Artificial Intelligence Nvidia’s Chat with RTX is a promising AI chatbot that runs locally on your PC Nvidia’s Chat with RTX is a promising AI chatbot that runs locally on your PC / Nvidia makes it easy to run a large language model on your own Windows PC. By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Feb 13, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Nvidia is releasing an early version of Chat with RTX today, a demo app that lets you run a personal AI chatbot on your PC. You can feed it YouTube videos and your own documents to create summaries and get relevant answers based on your own data. It all runs locally on a PC, and all you need is an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM. I’ve been briefly testing out Chat with RTX over the past day, and although the app is a little rough around the edges, I can already see this being a valuable part of data research for journalists or anyone who needs to analyze a collection of documents. Chat with RTX can handle YouTube videos, so you simply input a URL, and it lets you search transcripts for specific mentions or summarize an entire video. I found this ideal for searching through video podcasts, particularly for finding specific mentions in podcasts over the past week amid rumors of Microsoft’s new Xbox strategy shift. It wasn’t perfect for searching YouTube videos, though. I tried to search through the transcript of a Verge YouTube video, and Chat with RTX downloaded the transcript for a completely different video. It wasn’t even one that I had queried before, so there are clearly bugs in this early demo. Chat with RTX is great at searching your local documents. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge When it worked properly I was able to find references in videos within seconds. I also created a dataset of FTC v. Microsoft documents for Chat with RTX to analyze. When I was covering the court case last year, it was often overwhelming to search through documents at speed, but Chat with RTX helped me query them nearly instantly on my PC. For example, the chatbot did a good job summarizing Microsoft’s entire Xbox Game Pass strategy from internal documents revealed at the trial: Based on the provided context information, Xbox Game Pass is a content subscription service in gaming that provides access to a library of games for a single monthly fee. It is envisioned as a platform that empowers players to play their games anywhere and allows publishers to reach players everywhere. The service is supported by Project xCloud and Xbox Series X, and it aims to create a fertile ground for publishers to monetize their games. The primary strategic objective for the Gaming CSA is to scale Xbox Game Pass, and it is believed that there is a significant subscriber opportunity globally, with a potential of 750 million subscribers. The service faces three primary content dynamics, including the need for differentiated content, expanding beyond console, and limited content supply. I’ve also found this useful to scan through PDFs and fact-check data. Microsoft’s own Copilot system doesn’t handle PDFs well within Word, but Nvidia’s Chat with RTX had no problem pulling out all the key information. The responses are near instant as well, with none of the lag you usually see when using cloud-based ChatGPT or Copilot chatbots. The big drawback to Chat with RTX is that it really feels like an early developer demo. Chat with RTX essentially installs a web server and Python instance on your PC, which then leverages Mistral or Llama 2 models to query the data you feed it. It then utilizes Nvidia’s Tensor cores on an RTX GPU to speed up your queries. Chat with RTX isn’t always accurate, though. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge It took around 30 minutes for Chat with RTX to install on my PC, which is powered by an Intel Core i9-14900K processor with an RTX 4090 GPU. The app is nearly 40GB in size, and the Python instance takes up around 3GB of RAM out of the 64GB available on my system. Once it’s running, you access Chat with RTX from a browser, while a command prompt runs in the background spewing out what’s being processed and any error codes. Nvidia isn’t offering this as a polished app that all RTX owners should download and install immediately. There are a number of known issues and limitations, including that source attribution isn’t always accurate. I also initially attempted to get Chat with RTX to index 25,000 documents, but this seemed to crash the app, and I had to clear the preferences to get going again. Chat with RTX also doesn’t remember context, so follow-up questions can’t be based on the context of a previous question. It also creates JSON files inside the folders you ask it to index, so I wouldn’t recommend using this on your entire Documents folder in Windows. I love a good tech demo, though, and Nvidia has certainly delivered that here. It shows the promise of what an AI chatbot can do locally on your PC in the future, especially if you don’t want to have to subscribe to something like Copilot Pro or ChatGPT Plus just to analyze your personal files.

It's basically a tech demo for TensorRT-LLM, a framework that amongst other things optimises inference time for LLMs on Nvidia cards. Their base repo supports quite a few models. Previously there was TensorRT for Stable Diffusion[1], which provided pretty drastic performance improvements[2] at the cost of customisation. I don't forsee this being as big of a problem with LLMs as they are used \"as is\" and augmented with RAG or prompting techniques.

Also for some reason the LLaMA 13b (24.5GB) and Ministral 7b (13.6GB) but only installed Ministral? Ministral 7b runs about as accurate as I remeber, but responses are faster than I can read. This seems at the cost of context and variance/temperature - although it's a chat interface the implementation doesn't seem to take into account previous questions or answers. Asking it the same question also gives the same answer. The RAG (llamaindex) is okay, but a little suspect. The installation comes with a default folder dataset, containing text files of nvidia marketing materials. When I tried asking questions about the files, it often cites the wrong file even if it gave the right answer. reply kkielhofner 14 hours agorootparentThe wrapping of TensorRT-LLM alone is significant. I’ve been working with it for a while and it’s… Rough. That said it is extremely fast.

It's an Nvidia \"product\", published and promoted via their usual channels. This is co-sign/official support from Nvidia vs \"Here's an obscure name from a dizzying array of indistinguishable implementations pointing to some random open source project website and Github repo where your eyes will glaze over in seconds\". Completely different but wider and significantly less sophisticated audience. The story link is on The Verge and because this is Nvidia it will also get immediately featured in every other tech publication, website, subreddit, forum, twitter account, youtube channel, etc. This will get more installs and usage in the next 72 hours than the entire Llama/open LLM ecosystem has had in its history. reply McAtNite 15 hours agorootparentUnfortunately I’m not aware of the reference to the HN Dropbox thread. I suppose my counter point is only that the user base that relies on simplified solutions is largely already addressed with the wide number of cloud offerings from OpenAi, Microsoft, Google, whatever other random company has popped up. Realistically I don’t know if the people who don’t want to use those, but also don’t want to look at GitHub pages is really that wide of an audience. You could be right though. I could be out of touch with reality on this one, and people will rush to use the latest software packaged by a well known vendor. reply thecal 15 hours agorootparentIt is probably the most famous HN comment ever made and comes up often.

Most users don't care whether whether the model is run, online or local. They go to ChatGPT or Bing/Copilot to get answers, as long as they are free. Well, if it becomes a (mandatory) subscription, they are more likely to pay for it rather than figure out how to run a local LLM. Sounds like you are the one who's not getting the message. So basically the only people who runs a local LLM are those who are interested enough in this. Any why would brand name matter? What matters is whether a model is good, whether it can run on a specific machine and how fast it is etc, and there are objectives for it. People who run local LLM don't automatically choose Nvidia's product over something just because nvidia is famous. reply Capricorn2481 15 hours agorootparentprevI have no idea what you're talking about and am waiting for an answer to OPs question.

Pre-releases when available can be found on the Sparkle's Releases or on your favorite package manager. More nightly builds can be downloaded by selecting a recent workflow run and downloading the corresponding Sparkle-distribution artifact. The current status for future versions of Sparkle is tracked by its roadmap. Please visit Sparkle's website for up to date documentation on using and migrating over to Sparkle 2. Refer to Changelog for a more detailed list of changes. More internal design documents to the project can be found in the repository under Documentation. Features Seamless. There's no mention of Sparkle; your icons and app name are used. Secure. Updates are verified using EdDSA signatures and Apple Code Signing. Supports Sandboxed applications in Sparkle 2. Fast. Supports delta updates which only patch files that have changed and atomic-safe installs. Easy to install. Sparkle requires no code in your app, and only needs static files on a web server. Customizable. Sparkle 2 supports plugging in a custom UI for updates. Flexible. Supports applications, package installers, preference panes, and other plug-ins. Sparkle 2 supports updating external bundles. Handles permissions, quarantine, and automatically asks for authentication if needed. Uses RSS-based appcasts for release information. Appcasts are a de-facto standard supported by 3rd party update-tracking programs and websites. Stays hidden until second launch for better first impressions. Truly self-updating — the user can choose to automatically download and install all updates in the background. Ability to use channels for beta updates (in Sparkle 2), add phased rollouts to users, and mark updates as critical or major. Progress and status notifications for the host app. Requirements Runtime: macOS 10.13 or later. Build: Latest major Xcode (stable or beta, whichever is latest) and one major version less. HTTPS server for serving updates (see App Transport Security) Usage See getting started guide. No code is necessary, but a bit of configuration is required. Troubleshooting Please check Console.app for logs under your application. Sparkle prints detailed information there about all problems it encounters. It often also suggests solutions to the problems, so please read Sparkle's log messages carefully. Use the generate_appcast tool which creates appcast files, correct signatures, and delta updates automatically. Make sure the URL specified in SUFeedURL is valid (typos/404s are a common error!), and that it uses modern TLS (test it). API symbols Sparkle is built with -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden which means no symbols are exported by default. If you are adding a symbol to the public API you must decorate the declaration with the SU_EXPORT macro (grep the source code for examples). Building the distribution package You do not usually need to build a Sparkle distribution unless you're making changes to Sparkle itself. To build a Sparkle distribution, cd to the root of the Sparkle source tree and run make release. Sparkle-VERSION.tar.xz (or .bz2) will be created and revealed in Finder after the build has completed. Alternatively, build the Distribution scheme in the Xcode UI. Code of Conduct We pledge to have an open and welcoming environment. See our Code of Conduct.",

The days when I’d mostly use downloadable native software for my Mac. The days when most of the software I regularly used had a somewhat consistent UX. reply whalesalad 18 hours agoparentI miss Adium. reply Angostura 16 hours agorootparentI miss the world in which software like Adium was possible reply parl_match 8 hours agorootparentIt still is.

You could start here, if you are interested, to get a taste: https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/#creating-... reply mirashii 8 hours agorootparentI don't think this is what was meant by Adium being possible. At its peak, Adium acted as a single frontend to many different instant messaging networks to provide you a single user interface for chat. Today, we've regressed to a point where this is no longer really feasible; every network requires its own client. reply mrweasel 13 hours agorootparentprevLooking at the git repo, seeing the last commit being three years old is a bit sad. Someone sat down one day created a patch and committed it, and then they went away, to work on other things, leaving the git repository in a digital limbo. reply eddieroger 14 hours agorootparentprevSo do I, so often. I made an Adiumy animation pack for my university that actually got mildly popular, and it was amazing. Such a quality app, and so nice when communication systems were standards not apps. reply xcrunner529 7 hours agorootparentSeeing Adium and the message themes is one of the big things that made me want a Mac believe it or not. It looked so pretty. reply malermeister 12 hours agorootparentprevWell, they weren't really standards by design either, people just reverse engineered their protocols. One could still do that, it's just that... nobody does anymore? reply koito17 10 hours agorootparentThe countless matrix bridges[1] to Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, etc. that are actively maintained, together with dozens of Pidgin plugins[2] serving similar purposes suggests otherwise. Granted, I don't expect Pidgin plugins to be well maintained compared to the Matrix appservice bridges. But still, there is at least one protocol that bridges to almost everything, and that's Matrix. For several years I used Matrix as little more than a glorified IRC and Slack client. [1] https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/ [2] https://pidgin.im/plugins/?type=Protocol reply LoganDark 8 hours agorootparentprevOh no, people have tried to reverse-engineer apps like Signal or Discord. The problem is that the company starts aggressively banning every user of the reverse-engineered clients, as well as mounting legal attacks on their authors. reply koito17 10 hours agorootparentprevI still use Adium as an XMPP client. It has a fair share of bugs due to existing Cocoa APIs rotting, but it still works perfectly fine for the one XMPP server I browse (which has OMEMO encryption enabled!) reply kergonath 18 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. That thing was a gem. reply dewey 20 hours agoprevMaybe I‘m weird, but for some reason seeing a Sparkle „Update available“ modal popping up fils me with joy (The software I‘m using is getting better) and I enjoy reading the changelog. If there’s some weird custom updater in another software it always fills me with dread because I have to navigate a different UI, and probably have to restart it immediately. reply adamomada 13 hours agoparentThe modal popup is the single thing I can’t stand about sparkle updates. Why oh why can’t they use the regular notification system and respect DND. It always seems so random as well, it’s not when the application starts or quits, just some rando timer polling for updates to surprise me with an interruption I can’t ignore reply veeti 5 hours agorootparentNothing worse than starting iTerm and typing half a command when suddenly this thing interrupts you. reply wingerlang 17 hours agoparentprevI don't think that's weird, I enjoy those as well. So much so that I have a newsletter where I post changelogs of various apps that had updates in the past week (https://buttondown.email/appsandupdates). Adding apps is a slow process but I'm starting to see quite a bit of repeated apps so I'll have to speed it up. reply eddi 1 hour agorootparentIn the latest newsletter „Clean my Mac X“ is listed. I always assumed that this is some form of malware, because they advertise so aggressively. Does it really make sense to „clean“ your mac? reply dewey 3 hours agorootparentprevIs anyone really interested in reading the detailed changelog for apps they don't use? reply wingerlang 2 hours agorootparentIn practice it's more of a software discovery email, with the added bonus of knowing that they are being worked on actively, and finding out what sort of things they are working on at the same time. It's not really about \"bug fixes and improvements\" and I trim those out if I have time. reply longnguyen 19 hours agoprevSparkles is a godsend. I use it on all my indie apps and it saves so much time. The best part is I could release with confidence knowing that I don’t have to ask for AppStore Review for each release. The new version with delta updates and flags for critical updates is amazing. 10/10 reply graemep 12 hours agoparentThanks for that.

IFF you are geographically located in the EU and using an iPhone (not iPad), you may one day have the option to use an alternative browser engine. You know, once browser vendors get around to making a version of their app that conforms to Apple's asinine requirements. The whole malicious compliance shebang. EU mandates browser choice, so Apple implements new technological measures to ensure that browser choice will still not be offered outside the EU reply philistine 14 hours agorootparentprevHomebrew has statistics.

That one I only run it like once a month. For the other one, I got my alias, haha: buuc reply bartekpacia 18 hours agorootparentprevI always do: brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup && brew autoremove reply snorremd 18 hours agoparentprevExactly. It is so simple to do `brew install figma` or whatever App you want. Most bigger apps have ready casks to install. Then I have a startup job that does `brew bundle dump --file=- > $ICLOUD/Brewfile`. That way I get a backup list of all software installed with brew so it is simple to install again if I migrate to a new machine (without restoring a Time Machine backup). Edit: Obviously for users not familiar with command line programs brew isn't that \"easy\". But for command line people this setup is quite nice. reply zacte 17 hours agorootparentRaycast has an excellent extension to manage brew installs and upgrades without any cli on macs reply Amorymeltzer 18 hours agoparentprevNotably, many cask formulae use Sparkle as the livecheck mechanism that is used to find updates to casks. reply incanus77 17 hours agoprevI used to author two indie Mac apps ~15 years ago, right around when Sparkle came out. It was a joy to add to my projects, a model to learn about great Cocoa framework programming, and still is always pleasant for me as a user. Huge independent success story on the Mac. reply fifafu 19 hours agoprevI have been using Sparkle in my apps for almost 15 years now (for millions of updates). It has always worked perfectly well for me. Really great project and still very active. reply systemz 19 hours agoprevI instantly recognized screenshot in README.md Thanks to this thread I now know name of software that helps bring updates to a lot of apps I use daily. Big kudos to all contributors of Sparkle, you all make our lives easier! reply hermitcrab 16 hours agoprevI write software for Mac and Windows (in C++/Qt). I put each new release out as a separate application for the user to install. Is there some equivalent to Sparkle that runs on both Mac AND Windows, so I don't have to integrate a separate system on each OS? Also I worry about update frameworks as way for bad guys to do bad things via my software. Should I be worried? reply gwbas1c 13 hours agoparentWindows installation system is so fundamentally different that it's hard to have a 1-size-fits-all update mechanism. When I shipped a cross-platform application, we used Sparkle on Mac, and a simple utility that downloaded and ran an MSI file for Windows. In general, I wouldn't worry too much about Sparkle being a vulnerability. It requires that your download servers are hacked: https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/08/handbrake-trojan-mac-malware-... reply hermitcrab 12 hours agorootparentCurrently I used Inno Setup to create a .exe installer on Windows and DropDMG to create a .dmg image on Mac. Presumably Sparkle and Winsparkle both use a similar update mechanism and that doesn't involve full Windows or Mac installers (otherwise, what would be the point?). reply gwbas1c 11 hours agorootparentSparkle works with a .dmg file, so you'd probably continue using DropDMG. I can't speak much for Winsparkle; I remember looking at it and immediately concluding that it wouldn't work for us. (FWIW: I ended up slipping in a few hacks so we could pop open browser windows on specific versions and commits, and even remotely kill them if needed.) reply hermitcrab 16 hours agoparentprevAh, I see https://winsparkle.org/ is a thing. reply Deadpikle 11 hours agoparentprevThere is one that is .NET and cross platform (incl.

It also doesn't really take much more than an S3 bucket to facilitate updates. And as a user, it's a great user experience that updates are handled in a similar manner in almost all of the apps that I install. Great piece of software. reply Y-bar 19 hours agoparentAs a consumer of Mac OS software thank you! Seeing a Sparkle dialogue is such a nicety and it makes me feel good. reply ThePowerOfFuet 20 hours agoprevThe one and only. Everything else is garbage in comparison. reply apple4ever 14 hours agoprevLove Sparkle! Both as a user and a developer of apps (I'd never sell in the Mac App Store due to Apple's consumer unfriendly policies). It works so well and is so easy to setup. reply prmoustache 20 hours agoprevAre you telling me macOS doesn't have a package manager already? reply pantulis 20 hours agoparentIn terms of apps no, it doesn't or basically it is the Mac App Store. You basically publish your app with all the dependencies and target a specific OS version which guarantees certain baseline frameworks. Apart from that, any update means publishing a new version to the App Store (if you are there). If you are self hosting the app, you need something like Sparkle to trigger app updates. In terms of proper package management a la yum or apt, there is homebrew of course. reply haykuro 19 hours agorootparentI switched to MacPorts after becoming tired of Brew tainting my filesystem. MacPorts keeps things clean in /opt/. https://www.macports.org/ https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-pack... reply stadeschuldt 19 hours agorootparentNowadays Homebrew keeps its stuff under /opt/homebrew/ reply Hamuko 16 hours agorootparentOnly if you have an ARM64 Mac. x86 still use the old path. reply jwells89 19 hours agorootparentprevI used MacPorts back in the 00s and early 10s but switched to Homebrew when it came out because it was less hassle. Wanted to give it another shot with my latest clean OS install, but wound up installing Homebrew again due to broken packages on MacPorts. Probably should’ve tried to contribute by fixing those packages but didn’t have the time or mental energy available at that point in time. reply pasc1878 10 hours agorootparentHow is it less hassle. Installation is similar just a standard mac install. apps are the same. The only difference is that Homebrew gets confused if you install your code or another build in /usr/local oh and Homebrew forces you to use non standard permissions on /usr/local reply jwells89 9 hours agorootparentBack when I switched, it wasn’t unusual for MacPorts packages to not compile for some reason or another, and at that point my skills in that realm were lacking which meant I had little ability to fix these issues, rendering its technical superiorities over Homebrew moot. Homebrew was less hassle in that most of the time, it successfully installed things and when it didn’t, it was fixed in short order. Since then I’ve become much more capable of diagnosing and fixing broken packages but it’s still not something I’d like to spend my time on if I can help it. reply prmoustache 20 hours agorootparentprevOK so basically the point is to avoid Mac App Store fees and independence to third party project like homebrew. Doesn't that leads to the situation on windows where every single app is phoning home at startup? reply masklinn 20 hours agorootparentWell the original point is that sparkle predates MAS by more than a decade, and the MAS limitations are a bigger issue than the fees. > Doesn't that leads to the situation on windows where every single app is phoning home at startup? Sparkle has a very clear and regular behaviour, its predictability and widespread use made it easy to manage. reply madeofpalk 20 hours agorootparentAs a more technical user who is aware of Sparkle, I recognise the Sparkle updater and I appreciate it. In fact, I miss this on Windows, where each app updates differently, and most will just throw you annoyingly to the install wizard all over again. reply steve1977 13 hours agorootparentTo be fair, Windows Installer can also handle updates (and patches). And proper uninstallation, which is something that’s missing on macOS. reply prmoustache 20 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the history lesson. reply lapcat 19 hours agorootparentprev> Doesn't that leads to the situation on windows where every single app is phoning home at startup? 1) It's a setting/preference. The polite/respectful app developers will ask users whether they want to automatically check for updates. 2) It's periodic. Developers can set the default to whatever they prefer — daily, weekly, monthly, etc. — and again the polite developers may give the user an option here too. reply pantulis 18 hours agorootparentprevYou are correct. That's why Sparkle is still relevant these days and of course it requires the app to phone home. Interesting things could happen with third party App Stores if they ever see the light in macOS. reply madeofpalk 15 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean? There's already third party app stores on macOS. Steam and all the other gaming ones. Setapp is a more non-gaming one. reply j16sdiz 19 hours agorootparentprevmacOS app store mandates apps sandbox. If your app, for some reason, don't run in sandbox, you need to distribute it outside app store. reply alkonaut 19 hours agorootparentprevUsually the point of \"software update frameworks\" is to make the app phone home and check if there is an update isn't it? I mean you can have an option to not make it check for updates if you want to provide a privacy option for people, but that just makes it a manual click-to-check-for-updates. Most people would probably leave the \"check for updates on start\" checked. Can't see how that's a difference based on what OS you are on? I use Squirrel/Velopack (the equivalent for Windows I guess) and the usual way of managing updates is to have an update check at startup, or an interval (e.g. every hour). reply prmoustache 16 hours agorootparent>Can't see how that's a difference based on what OS you are on? I have been a linux and openbsd user for the most part of the last 3 decades with only short stints on windows in a professionnal setting or when fixing up my partner's issues and nearly 0 experience of macOS apart from launching it in a VM out of curiosity 3 times so I was genuinely surprised and not aware of potential restrictions of app store. I know on windows there is the microsoft store + chocolatey that can handle apps updates (and possibly other projects?). I have had the occasionnal java app installed in /opt from a tarball or an appimage but for me apps individually phoning home is more the exception than the norm. I usually have one process connecting to n repos, n being less than 5 usually and usually only when I am querying it manually. In recent years on Fedora I've let gnome software app connecring automatically and I guess with some flatpaks installed I am querying 2 flatpak repos (fedora +flathub) more but that's about it and most of our distro packages have telemetry and users counts disabled. reply destitude 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's just downloading an xml file to see if there is an update available. reply masklinn 18 hours agorootparentAnd talking about “XML file” is obscuring it, an “appcast” feed is an RSS feed with a few extensions. reply Hamuko 20 hours agorootparentprevSparkle automatically limits update checking to once per 24 hours if that makes you feel any better. reply bluish29 20 hours agorootparentprevMany open source (and even proprietary apps) apps get published using homebrew casks [1]. Although they usually use that as supplementary method. And sometimes it is done by volunteers. [1] https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/ reply TheAceOfHearts 19 hours agorootparentprevYou can use homebrew to install regular apps as well, thanks to the casks feature. There's probably some apps that aren't available as casks, but usually everything I need is available already. reply zitterbewegung 19 hours agoparentprevMac classic had full compiled applications that you would drag to your applications folder. This is the same when it's distributed by dmg and told you are to drag to the Applications folder and using Sparkle on this is a common method to update or to just give another dmg. Another way you can distribute your app is to use a dmg to with a pkg file in it and this launches an installation wizard very similar to what you would see on windows. Then there is homebrew that has a series of ruby formulas that can do nearly all of the above. Obviously there is the Mac App Store. reply anbotero 18 hours agoparentprevNot officially, but these days first things I setup in Onboarding documents (if they don’t have it already) is how to setup Homebrew. I install pretty much everything I need on macOS through Homebrew these days. reply bni 19 hours agoparentprevThankfully, it doesn't reply api 18 hours agoparentprevIt has Homebrew, which many people use and is great. It also has its App Store but nobody uses it for anything non-trivial because it's so jailed. reply favorited 11 hours agorootparent> nobody uses it for anything non-trivial I guess the Microsoft Office suite, LibreOffice, Adobe Lightroom, Pixelmator, Sketch, OmniGraffle, etc. are trivial? reply watk 20 hours agoprevThis looks great. What would be the equivalent of this on Windows? It feels like everyone just invents their own. reply marcellus23 18 hours agoparentThere's a version of Sparkle for Windows. I have no idea why apps don't adopt it. I am constantly amazed and frustrated at how many apps I use on Windows have the following update process: 1. Pops up an alert telling me an update is available 2. I click a link in the alert opening my browser, taking me to a webpage full of links for different OSes and different architectures, which I have to search through to find Windows Intel x64 3. Wait to download the new version and then open it up 4. Spend 30 seconds clicking through a Windows Installer Absolutely bonkers, especially considering some of these apps seem to release on an agile biweekly schedule. I usually procrastinate downloading updates because it's such a pain in the ass -- and that's not what you want your users to be doing. reply daveoc64 17 hours agorootparentI tried looking for something like Sparkle on Windows a few weeks ago. Now I know it exists - thanks! reply jhfdbkofdchk 20 hours agoparentprevWell, someone made something inspired by Sparkle for Windows, https://winsparkle.org reply usrusr 18 hours agoparentprevOn Windows, chances are that once you have a working installer you will be so deeply stockholmed that the idea that updates might go any other way than through a future incarnation of that installer is completely alien to you.

This is absolutely brilliant if it is sarcasm. Sparkle has been around for what feels like decades. It was around long before the app store even existed. It has been the defacto way to update apps for a long time. You have probably used it a half dozen times without realizing it. reply seltzered_ 18 hours agorootparentSparkle was around in 2006 - before the iPhone, before the Mac App Store. The original author ( Andy Matuschak ) worked at Apple for a number of years after Sparkle was being fairly well used. See https://sparkle-project.org/about/ reply whalesalad 18 hours agorootparentI worked at a startup back in 2008 - we loved sparkle. Our entire app was ultimately stolen by Apple and implemented in iPhoto. We made the mistake of hiring an ex iPhoto team member as a contractor who ended up going back to Apple with our ideas. Wild time for startups. reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparentprevYes correct, this is not my opinion (at all, in fact I think the exact opposite). My goal was to take the same arguments that we get repeatedly from iOS and apply them to the Mac. In fact, I wrote it carefully without mentioning platform-specific things so that the exact same text could apply equally whether you were talking about the macOS or iOS. I appreciate the compliment, but I mainly just aggregated and paraphrased the arguments I've been reading over the last several week :-) Though I honestly approached it as an attempt at the Ideological Turing Test, not just as a sarcastic or underhanded way of scoring dumb rhetorical internet points. I genuinely am interested to understand why proponents of that viewpoint on iOS wouldn't carry that over to macOS? reply notpushkin 18 hours agorootparentprevI've almost downvoted but yeah, this can't possibly be a serious post. Not yet. reply ZekeSulastin 18 hours agorootparentprev [–] It’s an obvious strawman of arguments in favor of the iOS App Store. reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparent [–] It's not my serious argument, but it's not intended as a strawman. Please, I genuinely would like to know, why do those arguments apply to iOS but not to macOS? Where do you see a strawman in what I wrote? reply RedComet 14 hours agorootparent [–] They don't apply to iOS either. It isn't their device once someone else purchases it. Furthermore, not allowing \"sideloading\" and bootloader unlocking is wrong.

It's no wonder why the CEOs of both companies have recently resigned. Lost love in the crowded dating app market is nothing new. One moment a dating app might be hot and heavy with consumers, but the next they're getting dumped. Match Group has tried to overcome this problem by incubating new dating apps and, more aggressively, acquiring rival ones. Originally just associated with the dating site Match.com, Match Group now oversees a sprawling dating empire of at least 45 dating apps, including Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge and The League. Before we dive deeper into their problems, it's worth saying that dating apps have helped many people find love. According to a survey of Americans by Pew Research Center published last year, \"one-in-ten partnered adults — meaning those who are married, living with a partner or in a committed romantic relationship — met their current significant other through a dating site or app.\" But there's an awkward tension at the heart of the dating app business model. They are for-profit tech companies that want to attract as many users as possible and inevitably make money from them. But at the same time, true success for their users — at least for the large population looking for more than just hookups — means that they find love and get off the apps. For each successful match, the dating app loses not just one, but two customers! Call it the dating app paradox: Dating apps are supposed to be matching lovebirds together, but once they do, the lovebirds fly away — and take their money with them. [Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.] Of all the dating apps, Hinge — a Match Group property that has grown increasingly popular in recent years — is perhaps the most illustrative of the dating app paradox. Hinge markets itself as \"the dating app designed to be deleted.\" How many other companies market themselves this way? Hinge is literally touting success as constantly losing customers. Their social and business missions are in a messy relationship, to say the least. A viral theory for why dating apps are so bad Last month, TikTok user bianca (@infinitebs), who calls herself an \"amateur sociologist & silly goose\" on her profile, released a viral TikTok video in which she argues that, basically, Hinge is the latest dating app to inevitably fall victim to the core contradiction between its missions of matchmaking and moneymaking. Hinge, like many other dating apps, has a \"freemium\" business model, which means you can sign up and use the basic app for free, but extras — like a higher-visibility profile or the ability to message people who have not shown interest in you — cost money. According to a poll published by Pew last year, about a third of Americans who have used dating apps have paid to do so. Morgan Stanley found that dating app users who choose to pay end up spending \"between $18 and $19 per month on either subscriptions or a la carte purchases.\" But the dating app companies — and their investors — are apparently not satisfied with the number of users who are choosing to pay for their services. With their stock prices in the gutter and their investors clamoring for more revenue, many dating apps have been shifting gears to entice more free users to become paid users. Like many other users, Bianca is not happy with that. Hinge, she argues, has \"hit the inflection point\" where its free version is \"absolute trash.\" In its mission to make money, it has been using tricks and schemes — like, she says, putting desirable matches \"behind a paywall\" — to convince more of its users to pony up and use premium features. Dating apps aren't alone in seemingly getting worse when they try to make money. In fact, last year journalist Cory Doctorow coined a term for this pattern: \"enshittification.\" Basically, Doctorow says tech platforms start off trying to make their user experiences really good because their first goal is to try to become popular and achieve scale. But over time, they inevitably pursue their ultimate goal of making money, which ends up making the whole user experience \"enshittified.\" Historically at least, daters could find an easy solution if a dating app put its moneymaking interest ahead of its interest in matchmaking and ruined the user experience. That fix: healthy competition. Lovebirds would flock to another app. For example, as Bianca notes in her video, when Tinder went downhill, users headed to Bumble and then eventually to Hinge. But unlike previous sagas in the dating app wars, Bianca asserts, a new better app has failed to overtake Hinge. The result: \"Dating apps have never been worse than they are now.\" Bianca is hardly alone in asserting that dating apps are now worse than ever. So if we accept that we've now entered the dark ages of app dating, why isn't competition working anymore? It's possible that new apps are failing to rise and topple the reigning ones because of monopolistic strategies of companies like Match Group, which has been systematically acquiring rivals, including Hinge back in 2018. Match Group, of course, denies that its acquisition strategy hurts healthy competition in the dating app market. And it also rejects what we've been calling the dating app paradox. It doesn't see a contradiction between its goals of matchmaking and moneymaking. It sees its social and business missions as in a stable, beautiful marriage. \"Our goal is to make meaningful connections for every single person on our platforms,\" says a Match Group spokesperson. \"Our business model is driven by providing users with great experiences, so they champion our brands and their power to form life-changing relationships. Unlike many other tech platforms, our business is not driven by keeping users engaged on the apps, but by successful outcomes. We receive wedding invitations and hear Match Group love stories every day, and we celebrate those.\" Match Group argues, in other words, that its business incentives are aligned with the interests of its users looking for lasting love. But are they really? Sure, app executives may get warm, fuzzy feelings about receiving wedding invitations from their clients. Matched couples may even tell their single friends, helping to convince new people to join their apps. However, we can imagine a dating app business model where its incentives are much more closely aligned with users' hopes of finding love. Imagine the app gets paid only when people successfully match and leave the app! Now that would eliminate the dating app paradox. Adverse selection in the dating app market? It's possible there's another classic economics problem behind the cycle of dating app degradation. Daters looking for a life partner inevitably confront serious information problems. The people on these apps, after all, are usually complete strangers — and the only information you have about them is what they choose to put on their profiles. That may be fine for people just looking for hookups. But a core challenge for daters looking for true love on these apps: How do you sift through the players and commitment-phobes and find the gems? Economist George Akerlof won a Nobel Prize for his work explaining how information problems like this can ruin a market. (Fun fact: Akerlof is U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's husband. Now that's a worthy match!) Akerlof famously used the example of used cars to explain how bad information can result in market failures. It's well known that as soon as you drive a new car off the lot, its value drops precipitously. For a long time, economists explained this phenomenon by claiming that people just place a premium on having a brand-new car. But Akerlof offered a different explanation: Buyers of used cars lack vital information about what they're buying. When you buy a used car, there's always the chance it could be a lemon. Because of this risk of buying a piece of junk, Akerlof theorized, buyers become unwilling to pay top dollar for them. It's too risky. They treat every car like a potential lemon and demand a discount, even if the cars they're buying may actually look and run great. And that creates a problem for the sellers of used cars that are actually good. These sellers are like, \"What the heck?! I know my car isn't a lemon! It's worth way more than what you're willing to pay!\" And so they refuse to sell their used car and they exit the market. The result is a market where lemons become more prevalent. It's a vicious spiral where, as buyers become more suspicious that every car is a lemon, they demand further price markdowns and owners of good used cars become even more unwilling to sell at the lower price. Ultimately, the whole market gets destroyed. Because buyers have a hard time determining good from bad, the lemons drive quality used cars out of the market. Economists call this adverse selection. (Listen to this Planet Money Summer School episode for more. Spotify/Apple Podcasts) It's possible that dating apps face adverse selection. Basically, a new app starts up, and hopeless romantics looking for real love begin flocking to it. But so do sleazy types who lie on their dating profiles. Over time, the earnest daters go on a bunch of bad dates, encountering people who have no interest in real relationships or whose profiles are completely misleading. Like lemons driving good cars out of the used-car market, maybe sleazeballs push great catches out of dating apps and ultimately ruin the quality of the whole app experience. So people go to a new app with the hopes of finding something better, and the cycle starts again. Akerlof saw solutions to the lemon problem. Basically, people need warranties or ways to get better information about what they're buying. We've seen advances like this in the used-car market. For example, the company Carfax offers trusted information about the history of used cars. You can find out about a vehicle's history of accidents or its trips to the mechanic, for instance. This helps buyers overcome their suspicions and helps sellers of good used cars prove their cars are worth top dollar. It's possible that dating apps could try to find similar solutions. Think like a Carfax for daters! Or a rating system, which is Airbnb's solution to this kind of information problem. Of course, daters will probably object to any system that gives your exes the power to rate you :). It's possible, however, that app designers could find more suitable solutions to the information problems of the online dating world. All this said, maybe dating is just hard, especially now that you can potentially match with a much bigger number of people thanks to technology. Whatever the case, if you're in the market for love, good luck and, ummm, Happy Valentine's Day!

    "commentBody": "The dating app paradox (npr.org)202 points by zwieback 19 hours agohidepastfavorite410 comments sweetro17 10 hours agoFormer dating app founder here - lots of thoughts on the space - feel free to AMA High level though, there's a lot of human behavior which makes dating frustrating with or without apps. At it's core, even in the best case, dating has A LOT of rejection. Dating apps introduce more opportunity for incremental validation (you got liked!) but also incremental rejection (you got ghosted!) and the sheer number of interactions that lead to nothing is much higher and more quantifiable than IRL (you've all seen the r/tinder sankey diagrams) Two \"solutions\" I believe would generally benefit dating 1. Apps are more transparent and equitable with how they expose profiles to other users. Don't bias toward highly liked people to increase perceived \"quality\" and shadow-hide show profiles that aren't liked often (and then ask them to pay lol). Show people more randomly, to better represent the true cross section of people on the app. 2. Daters set some type of routine that works for them - say \"I'll try to go on ~1 date per month\". Being intentional about this helps minimize the feeling that each date is so fatalistic / it's the end of the world if the person who seemed awesome when messaging is actually a jerk. It'd be nice if an app facilitated this type of routine and figured out a feedback mechanism to reward users who were generally pleasant / respectful on their dates. reply hnthrowaway6543 7 hours agoparent> Apps are more transparent and equitable with how they expose profiles to other users. Don't bias toward highly liked people to increase perceived \"quality\" and shadow-hide show profiles that aren't liked often (and then ask them to pay lol). Show people more randomly, to better represent the true cross section of people on the app. This won't work; if you do this, you'll expose that the average online dating user is... well, average. There's a bit of kayfabe going on; users want to think the other users of online dating are 8+/10, sexy, flirty, fun, and desirable singles. Unfortunately, 69% of Americans are overweight and 36% are obese. If profiles users see weren't heavily weighted toward highly-rated ones, the perception of online dating would immediately change from \"online dating is fine, a bunch of attractive people are using this\" to \"online dating is only for the ugly and desperate\"; the article points out that this is the way Gen Z perceives online dating already. Dating apps really struggle to keep the most desirable, because those are the ones least likely to need it. Yet they're also the most important for a dating app to have. As fewer desirable people use it, the less perceived legitimacy it has, which results in fewer people using it, particularly the desirable ones. I suspect dating apps are experiencing this death spiral now. reply sweetro17 6 hours agorootparentI see your point here - and I do agree, from experience, people sometimes express a desire for a bit of reality distortion in dating (we often heard that they want the experience to feel more like 'fate' or 'chance' than overly engineered). That said, I don't fully agree with the idea that there's a uniform concept of x/10 scale for daters and that they uniformly will balk at those below that uniform rating and therefore the only way forward is boosting those based on their global like %. And some data backs this up. The oft-cited OkCupid Dataclysm book talks about variance (e.g. lots of people like / lots of people dislike), explaining variance is meaningfully more important to messaging and engagement than raw like %. Additionally, on the point of weight / body type, we found that a little under half of daters (and > 50% of women interested in men) do not report body type to be a significant factor in their decision making. So it is a meaningful factor, but for about 1/2 of daters it isn't. The point I'm trying to drive here is, while there is for sure data and intuition that points to what you're describing, there are others that point to other ways that people perceive the quality and likelihood of finding a partner on an app that may work as well, if not better, while not relying on a need to as heavily hack perception. reply nradov 5 hours agorootparentBody type is a significant factor for way more than 50%. People lie on surveys because they feel guilty for being superficial. reply throwaway290 5 hours agorootparent> Body type is a significant factor for way more than 50%. People lie on surveys because they feel guilty for being superficial. I think you are extrapolating your own view. You have no way of knowing what they feel and even for an educated guess you do not know which country/social class/occupation those users tend to be from in the app being discussed. reply PoignardAzur 28 minutes agorootparentRevealed preferences are a thing, no matter the social class. What people self-report to want and what they actually want is rarely the same, especially in fields with high social pressure. reply carabiner 3 hours agorootparentprevDo you also think women hate shirtless photos? Btw, this photo went viral a few weeks ago: https://imgur.com/a/CfXdtK2 reply atleastoptimal 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's true. The sad reality about dating is that, for 99% percent of people, the partner that would be ideal for their tastes is \"out of their league\" so to speak. Humans have dealt with this reality of dating acting somewhat like a marketplace via mores of commitment, dating within social classes, condemnation of promiscuity, etc., but the human nature is still there. 10's want 10's, but 5's don't want other 5's, they also want 10's. The strategy most dating apps use has been to keep people in a perpetual cycle of heightened seeming possibility. You see the young, cool, attractive people, and perhaps one out of 100 times you'll strike out, and the unlimited options keep you feeling that such an opportunity could happen infinitely. For average hetero dudes, this obsession will drive purchasing premium, paying for swipes and super likes, etc. I know it's controversial but I do believe that robotic/AI partners is the \"ideal world\" solution to this. You get someone who fulfills all your physical needs so you don't have to play the roulette in real life, or string along someone in your league because you believe you could get someone out of it. I'm sure in the future we'll see them similar to how we see sex toys today. reply throw310822 6 hours agorootparentStrange analysis. Considering that what people want from dating apps is sex and partners, and that both are easier to obtain from people of matching attractiveness. As a former dating app user, the possibility is something I never cared about: I cared about a date, there is a marketplace and- while I will try to find someone acceptable- certainly I'm not wasting my time chasing people out of my league. That produces just waste of time and money, rejection and frustration. I would rather say something different: dating apps have zero interest in making you find a partner- this means for them simply losing a customer. They would rather keep you in a cycle with some intermittent reward but preferably without losing you. Finally there is an huge difference between different classes of users: at the very minimum by gender, attractiveness and purpose. Casual sex is a totally different use case than looking for a partner; high attractiveness allows using the app intermittently for immediate reward, while average people need to put much more effort and entirely different mode of use. But despite all this complexity, apps have converged to a single hyper-simplistic model that optimizes maybe intake of new 20 year old users but works much worse than it could for most people. reply lmm 6 hours agorootparent> Considering that what people want from dating apps is sex and partners, and that both are easier to obtain from people of matching attractiveness. But people don't have an accurate perception of matching attractiveness. The average person is a 5 who thinks they're an 8. And they've been looking at celebrities rather than average people, so if you match them with a 5 then they'll think that's a 3. reply throw310822 6 hours agorootparentAnd yet the overwhelming majority of people of average attractiveness have mated and formed couples and married since forever. So that's possible. If an app is not able to match them, must be a failure of the app, not of nature. reply lmm 5 hours agorootparent> And yet the overwhelming majority of people of average attractiveness have mated and formed couples and married since forever. This was true up until a few decades now, but the rate of all of that is now declining precipitously. > If an app is not able to match them, must be a failure of the app, not of nature. Or there is a broader societal problem causing a decline in all forms of dating, not just apps. reply Spivak 4 hours agorootparentprevYou're defining attractiveness like boomers handing out grades where in real life that's not how the 10 scale is used, it follows video game review rules where 7 is middling. And this is right to happen with humans same as video games. It's not centered at average it's centered where 5 is \"not quite unattractive.\" And because the typical human is attractive the average sits at around 7. reply The_Colonel 1 hour agorootparentThat's a lot of subjectivity. For me, an average human is 5 and not really attractive. reply atleastoptimal 6 hours agorootparentprev> I would rather say something different: dating apps have zero interest in making you find a partner- this means for them simply losing a customer. They would rather keep you in a cycle with some intermittent reward but preferably without losing you. It sounds like you're agreeing with me. The apps benefit from people staying in the app, not partnered up stably. If the app only showed people they'd have the best longer-term prospects with, then it would likely show people in their attractiveness range as a rule. reply watwut 2 hours agorootparentprevThe idea that real world couples necessary match attractiveness is kind of incels invention. And then they get angry whenever they see a couple with one person super attractive and other .. normal. reply throw310822 1 hour agorootparentI find the whole argument, especially with the grades, silly. But it is true that usually partners match each other by attractiveness- also keeping in mind that attractiveness is not exclusively physical and means different things for different people. Attractiveness is not a scalar, it's a vector. reply intrasight 6 hours agorootparentprevA better, and tried and true solution, is ... Alcohol.

It's likely the going out (and then drink alcohol) which helps. And people nowadays don't go out a lot. reply realusername 1 hour agorootparentprev> There's a bit of kayfabe going on; users want to think the other users of online dating are 8+/10, sexy, flirty, fun, and desirable singles. I'd go a bit further than that, people are explicitly looking for that different reality when opening the app. That's one of the reasons of getting the app to them, getting better matches than in the reality. I don't think it's a solvable problem, online dating is just full of paradox, the paradox highlighted in the article is real but this is another one on top of that. reply jessriedel 7 hours agorootparentprev> \"online dating is only for the ugly and desperate\"; the article points out that this is the way Gen Z perceives online dating already. The article notes that Gen Z usage of dating apps is down, but it's not clear to me it's because they think it's low status. (Polo is unpopular, but it's high status.) Do you have more info on why Gen Z isn't using dating apps? It being low status is certainly possible, but lower over all interest in romance is too; Gen Z is famously having less sex. I followed the \"failing to woo Generation Z\" link, and just got this PDF, which didn't help much: https://www.generationlab.org/_files/ugd/b2ee84_c2430c8256ff... (College students are using dating apps less than post-college 20-somethings, but I think that's always been true.) reply zarzavat 4 hours agorootparentWhen people say Gen Z are they talking about Gen Z in America or Gen Z on Earth? I notice many qualities ascribed to Gen Z seem to be completely alien to Gen Z where I live which makes me suspect that these qualities are simply random variation and correlation hunting, and not inherent to that cohort’s formative experiences (smartphones, covid, etc). reply morbicer 3 hours agorootparentprevI think it's pretty simple - Gen Z are young and have better opportunity to date IRL. They are surrounded by many peers, have more free time and friend circles are still strong. As people grow older, they have more obligations, they sometimes move away from where they were raised thus breaking away from friends, they generally hang out in less homogenous age bracket. I bet Gen Z will get on dating apps in their 30s. reply watwut 2 hours agorootparentprevAverage American is not ugly and I mean it 100% seriously. Moreover, average American is as ugly offline as online. reply assimpleaspossi 9 hours agoparentprevThe solution to dating app problems is actual human contact and throwing dating apps away. There is too much to get wrong with text only. Say the wrong thing online and you're done. Say the wrong thing in person and you can judge by facial expressions that you did and get a chance to correct a misunderstanding. You also get a chance to actually see what the other person subliminally likes and dislikes. All in real time. Sure, you can text \"I like that\" but how would you know what you were getting into? reply maxlamb 9 hours agorootparentI’ve dated for years without apps trying to meet people organically, and then also years through dating apps, and I’ve had way more opportunities for human contact with dating apps. I mean the whole point of dating apps is to meet in person once you feel the person might be a good match reply monero-xmr 8 hours agorootparentThe benefit of dating apps IMO is that everyone on there is explicitly there to find a partner for some reason. In real life it’s a bit of a guessing game, which is fine, but the simple math is that love is easier to find where all the people looking for love are hanging out. reply The_Colonel 1 hour agorootparentThe trouble there is that the attractive people on the dating apps often aren't looking for partner, instead it's often just for self-validation. And as discussed above, these are preferentially shown to many people. reply sweetro17 8 hours agorootparentprev+1 - one of the biggest things we found actually, is externalizing the potentially uncomfortable elements of dating generally helps people be more authentic and focus on getting to know each other. A few examples: - As you said, dating apps, everyone is there to date, so you don't have to feel awkward about approaching someone not knowing if they're not single or interested in you or even if they are in the mood for conversing with a stranger - Hinge did a good job forcing Q&A. Before that people often thought it was uncool / signaled trying too hard to add a bio so people often had less info to go on. - On our app - we helped facilitate where people went on their first date (generally tried to pick more affordable / neutral options) - this took the pressure off of worrying if the person picking made a bad / too crowded choice - blame it on us! Not saying dating apps can remove everything uncomfortable about dating, but they can definitely help! reply Legend2440 9 hours agorootparentprevReally? I find that it is way easier to meet people in person. In real life, girls approach me at the gym. On apps, I get maybe one like a week and it's usually not someone I'm interested in. reply Sai_ 6 hours agorootparentprevSocially, we have to reduce “riskiness” of IRL approaching people with the intent to date. Right now, it’s scary to want to approach someone only to risk getting roasted for being a creep, barking up the wrong tree, and the myriad other reasons why people you want don’t want you. It has to be thing everyone does - somewhat like bar hopping on a weekend. You know you’re at the bar to find someone and so is everyone else. reply poulsbohemian 8 hours agorootparentprev>The solution to dating app problems is actual human contact and throwing dating apps away. You aren't wrong, but you dramatically expand your dating options by using these apps.

I absolutely have far, far more \"successful interactions\" in OLD, unless you're also referring to chatting, which is pointless to even discuss. I'm referring to actually meeting the person and whether that turns out success in whatever way someone considers that. If I go out to a bar and hang out, and potentially start talking to some new woman for hours knowing absolutely nothing about her - I have no idea if she's attracted to me, nor single, etc. I've probably spent thousands of hours casually talking to someone I may find interesting only to find out before they leave that they're either not interested or not single or not hetero, whatever.

Dating apps made me feel terrible about myself and invisible (“why am I getting no likes?” — for context I’m a guy). It wasn’t until I realised I had no idea who my profile was actually being shown to that it all started to make sense and I realised that’s the lever that apps can pull to make money. Fundamentally though I think your comment about human behaviour is spot-on and at the end of the day my belief is that dating is something you just can’t short-cut with technology.

To what extent do you think the core issues are driven by the different goals of men/women, and the dynamics they create? reply sweetro17 9 hours agorootparentGreat qs - As for why apps don't show profiles more randomly - I think because the space is so competitive, perceived quality is so important and frankly its \"easy\" for apps to leverage who they show to who and when in order to make users most likely to keep swiping and/or upgrade. I do think apps generally want you to find a partner, but are generally okay with making the experience valuable to them (even if that means gamifying and playing with who gets to see who and when) along the way. I'd say (assuming by the way you phrased the question you're referring to men who are generally interested in women, women who are generally interested in men) there are certain factors and preferences that trend across genders which do influence dating behavior and outcomes for these populations. Based on survey data we collected a few years ago - some are shared across genders (e.g. political views) others are not (e.g. height). But I wouldn't say there were glaring different \"goals\" by gender, so much as some difference in how important certain factor were. reply jimkleiber 8 hours agorootparentI'm curious to your thoughts: what do you think about a nonprofit dating app? Do you think they may shift the balance of your quote from above? > I do think apps generally want you to find a partner, but are generally okay with making the experience valuable to them (even if that means gamifying and playing with who gets to see who and when) along the way. reply sweetro17 8 hours agorootparentI could see it for sure - it'd at least be worth experimenting with. Beyond the functionality itself, I'd be most curious about how the idea that its a non-profit influences perception of the app and the people using the app. Profit or non-profit, it'd be nice to see apps talk more openly about how they approach matching - I think Coffee Meets Bagel did this a while back. reply jimkleiber 8 hours agorootparentAh sweet, yeah, the impact on social dynamics as well. Thanks for replying :-D reply gnicholas 8 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the responses. In terms of goals, I was thinking more of the relationship goals. Many men are happy using apps to play the field (I've talked with friends who simultaneously 'dated' half a dozen or more women), whereas most of the women I know used apps to find longer-term relationships. This can result in a small fraction of men going on a large number of dates (expecting that they don't need to commit) and a large fraction of women not thrilled that the desirable guys don't want to get serious. Are there ways around issues like this? Or is this more of an urban myth than a reality? reply sweetro17 8 hours agorootparentThere are statistics studies both endorsing and invalidating this concept. Some OkCupid / Tinder data suggest that \"likes\" are not evenly distributed, which has been extrapolated out to mean that dating is unbalanced. On the same token, unmarried rates are pretty equal across genders in the US suggesting that from an outcomes perspective people are achieving their relationship goals (at least in terms of marriage there are other goals). In our app, which was much more heavily skewed toward actual dates than likes, I would not characterize the pattern of people who went on dates heavily skewed toward a small portion of men - so it may be real from a liking perspective (I can't claim to refute data directly from the dating apps) but may be more of a myth when it comes to actual dating. reply Fr0styMatt88 9 hours agorootparentprevNot the OP but I think they don’t because it’s more profitable and makes a more addictive experience for the user. Think about it - an app can directly influence the amount of matches you get. Show your profile to everyone at the beginning, a fair number of matches. Not paid yet? Show their profile to fewer people, then when you think the user is about to leave, ramp up the visibility for just enough matches to keep them hooked. User just paid for the Gold tier? Increase their profile visibility… Not too much though, you want to create that dry spell so you can repeat the cycle and get them onto the Gold Plus tier. For-profit dating apps are essentially gambling apps. reply carabiner 9 hours agoparentprevWhat about throwing out the whole swipe-app paradigm with the matches and algo-stack and going back to okcupid style profiles that you can browse?

Based on complaints I hear it seems like a lot of younger people are so awkward and lacking in social skills that they literally don't know how to act and move the dating process forward. Maybe they need at LLM (or human coach for a premium fee) to prompt them on how to chat without seeming boring/crude/creepy/narcissistic, ask someone to meet in person, and then follow up after a date. Of course some people are just shitty and beyond help, but others just need a nudge in the right direction. reply zilti 1 hour agorootparentLLMs won't help them any more than \"normal\" dating/socializing advice did and does - which is not much.

Conservatives (in the US) want to turn the clock back on that, and make those relationships socially unacceptable or even illegal.

There's already a labor shortage, and presumably you want to make sure child-care workers are highly vetted. On top of this, with an aging population, there's a greater need for care workers for seniors, and here there's a lot of problems with these workers abusing the seniors. >- walkable safe environments, transportation, and regulations that allow children to move around on their own This would be great, but most Americans don't want this. They sure as hell aren't voting for it, and achieving it would require basically bulldozing most American cities. Americans have built themselves, ever since the end of WWII, a country and infrastructure that's entirely incompatible with the lifestyle you advocate here. I live in Tokyo now, and it's exactly what you're advocating here, but I simply can't imagine America somehow becoming like this in my lifetime. (It's one of the main reasons I came here.) Anyway, as other posters have noted, other countries have much of what you want here, and their fertility rates are quite poor, worse than the US in fact. If you really want to get people to have more children, you need to force society back to the \"good old days\", where women have far fewer rights, divorce is highly stigmatized, being non-religious or non-Christian is highly stigmatized, contraception is generally non-available, women basically can't have jobs except for schoolteachers (and only until they're married) or maids and need to just find a husband and become a SAHM, etc. Just look at the societies with high fertility, but contemporary and historically: they're absolutely horrible for women's rights. High fertility and large families have always been accomplished on the backs of oppressed women (and I'm not sure it was all that great for most men either). reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparent>>- free childcare > Where exactly are all the workers going to come from to support this one? This extends to most child-cost related issues: childcare, primary-education, activities, secondary-education, tertiary-education. Scaling the child:child-cost-worker ratio up needs to be a huge part of this. Which is going to require some out of the box thinking (e.g. cultural acceptance of MOOCs / online degrees). reply shiroiushi 2 hours agorootparentUm, I don't think this answers my question. Online courses aren't a substitute for early-childhood daycare. You have to have actual people present in-person to do these jobs, and people willing to do these jobs for the wages offered are in short supply, or are people you really don't want watching your kids. This also extends, as you seem to say, to other jobs with high contact with young children, like elementary school teachers. There's a shortage of them too. I suppose increasing salaries a lot might help, but we seem to be talking about government workers here, so that seems unlikely to happen. reply renewiltord 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's what everyone says but they're just Maginot lining it.

There seems to be a de-facto equilibrium springing up where wealthy countries quietly drop below replacement rate fertility and then migration from poorer regions happens. It isn't immediately clear why this is a bad thing either. It seems intuitively fair, sustainable for the forseeable future, nobody is being forced to do anything against their will. Might be a good outcome. We can't all have growing populations; given the failures of manufacturing and energy policy in the west that would just lead to war and not having enough stuff to maintain a good lifestyle. We're already having trouble treading water when it comes to lifestyles, the last thing we need is more people. reply kmmlng 36 minutes agorootparentIt causes lots of problems because many of our systems have been set up in times of growth and won't function without it. Take for example \"pay-as-you-go\" pension systems in much of Europe. Here, you don't fund your own retirement, but the current working population funds the retirement of the current retirement population. This works great when you have population growth, because you can have e.g. five working people fund one person's retirement. If the ratio moves closer to 1:1 or worse, this becomes a lot more challenging. Of course, population growth cannot continue forever, so we will have to figure this out anyway. Still, for any individual country, the smart move seems to be to stave it off for as long as possible, observe how other countries deal with it, and then implement the solutions that have actually worked for others yourself. reply d_burfoot 9 hours agorootparentprevI think colleges would be well-advised to create dating systems that encourage healthy relationships (keyword: healthy) between students.

Also women may be conservative and they might not want to join the latest dating app that ranks 50th on the App Store. So it’s not like anyone can create an app and be successful enough to be worth acquiring. Very few will reach that threshold and then the monopolist can buy those few ones.

My favorite argument there is that there's a big difference between what makes a dating app profitable, and what makes it good at finding people long term relationships. Not unlike how Amazon is far better off showing you ads in a search than giving you the best matching item that you probably want. The features that make an app crappier are what makes it sticky and lucrative. Making an app better at matching people is expensive, but doesn't give you revenue.

Has anyone got some other data sources on quality and satisfaction in dating apps, with some large sample sizes? reply devit 13 hours agoprevCommitted relationships found by judging other people's personality and looks are completely unnatural for human beings, and a result of conditioning by society. The natural state is living immersed in a place where other beings are and spontaneously interacting with them without a developed ego/personality filtering the interaction, as the closest relatives to human (chimpanzees and bonobos) do. This makes the socially-conditioned relationship model very unstable, since such a relationship will only work if, as long as and to the extent that the conditioned beliefs happen to match the other person and their beliefs. Since the conditioned beliefs are fundamentally false (because they are of the form \"you will be happy if X\" but happiness is actually the absence of any such belief) they are unstable and they will mutate once their falsehood is partially realized, and this process, along with viral cultural propagation, also creates many different conditioned mindsets that make matching and intimacy very challenging. So the problems with dating apps are just a very specific effect of what is the fundamental nature of human beings and reality. reply ravenstine 12 hours agoparentThe tech is superficially premised on the idea that humans will behave the same in captivity. Necessity and familiarity are critical variables in the right environment for pair bonding that can't be replicated through technology that exists to undermine those two things. Technology solves the necessity of people to depend on one another or invest their time in interpersonal experiences; it's easier than ever to shut the world out and not worry about survival. It also allows people to be distant while creating the illusion of connectedness, and people are going to be much less likely to invest in new relationships in that case. Take those things away and all you have is the primitive instinct to act on, which is what today's dating apps are specifically tuned to. If you want more than that, it's almost too bad, because opportunities for the sexes to engage in meaningful shared experiences are few and far between today. You're lucky if you see the same person more than once at a coffee shop. Go to a night club today, and chances are it will be predominantly full of people who for some reason aren't actually interested in having fun or giving anyone a chance outside of their clique. Workplaces are not only far more remote-oriented today but are less hospitable to relationships among coworkers than ever. Meetups are basically a joke now, and let's not even get into the bar. Younger generations are correct in getting out of the dating app game, even if perhaps it will take a while for people to actually return to meatspace for dating, by and large.

I haven't done the dog experiment myself, though I've seen it done a few times by others. It's quite the realization when a dog gets more attention than you do as a human on a dating app. Yeah, it's different, but it may not feel that way if all you want is for just one person to not dismiss you that day. However, I have done the experiment of pretending to be a stereotypical douchebag on dating apps, and that was especially enlightening. By douchebag, I mean that type of guy who shows his abs in mirror shots, wears a baseball cap sideways, and sends dick pics (I didn't actually do that part, but I'm illustrating a character here). Turns out that if all you want to do is get laid by attractive young women, then this is the guy you want to be. Many women in my locality are looking specifically for a good time with him.

It's like a club where women get in free. The algorithms will derank you very fast unless you're a 10/10 male, and you will basically get no matches from then on. Most guys who are successful on dating apps are paying for it. reply shiroiushi 6 hours agorootparentThat hasn't been my experience at all, and I definitely don't think I'm a 10/10. I've had absolutely no trouble getting dates. (This does not mean that all the dates were great, or led anywhere BTW; the vast majority were nice enough people but there was no interest on one side or the other.) When I see posts like this, I really wonder if men like you just don't know how to write a decent profile intro/bio and post some good photos. I think there are definitely certain things that make a dating profile more attractive, and many people aren't good at it. You might want to ask some female friends to evaluate your profile. reply nvarsj 57 minutes agorootparentIt's certainly possible to get dates without paying. But the difference between paying and not paying is pretty huge on apps like Bumble and Hinge (for men at least). For me, it was a difference between a few matches a week and multiple matches a day. Profile wise you are right, this is part of what makes a guy \"10/10\" or not (which might not match 10/10 in real life). For me, I am a divorced dad in my 40s with kids. That causes a lot of women to swipe left and there isn't much I can do about it, unless I lie. I think in general on dating apps, women are way choosier, men are less choosier, and this leads to a feedback cycle. Women have too much choice so they swipe left more, and men feel they have little choice so they swipe right more. If you pay the app, it artifically boosts your match rate constantly so you still get shown to lots of women regardless of swipe rate. This gives most guys a much better chance of finding the right woman for them. Contradicting myself though, the woman I'm dating now matched me OkCupid (where I was experimenting with a long form profile), and I didn't pay anything for that - but it was kind of luck I think. Bottom line is it comes down to a number game with OLD. The more people who see your profile across apps, the more chances you have. Paying is a cheat code in that respect and improves odds. reply arvinsim 2 hours agorootparentprev> hen I see posts like this, I really wonder if men like you just don't know how to write a decent profile intro/bio and post some good photos. I think there are definitely certain things that make a dating profile more attractive, and many people aren't good at it. But that itself is a filter, no? Not everyone have interesting lives to fill a good bio nor attractive enough to have some attractive photos. reply shiroiushi 2 hours agorootparentNo, I disagree. Just ask anyone in advertising: how you present something makes a huge difference in perception. Sure, not everyone can look like Brad Pitt in his prime, but your profile will look radically different with different photos. Having photos shot by a talented photographer, for instance, will get you better results than a couple of bathroom selfies. The same person can look much more attractive at certain camera angles, or with certain lighting. The composition of those photos will lead to very different results: what is in the photos? Are they shirtless selfies, are they showing you at the golf course, are they with your family (or ex), are they showing you on a hike, etc. Depending on what kind of person you want to attract, the photos you want to show will be very different. If you want an outdoorsy woman, don't post a bunch of photos of yourself in a bar, for instance. Same goes for the bio. You don't have to have an extremely interesting life, but you can write something that's somewhat interesting to read, and shows that you're not lazy. A bio with nothing at all, or worse \"just ask!\", screams that you're lazy and aren't willing to put any effort into your profile or your search for a match. A thoughtful bio just telling about things you like and what kind of person you're looking for, even if bland, is far better unless you're looking for a very shallow or stupid person (the kind who thinks \"just ask\" is a good bio). My advice for photos: get some good photos of yourself doing stuff you like to do, which you would like to find a companion for. If you want someone who goes out drinking with you a lot, then post photos of yourself at bars that you like. If you like to hang out at the gym all the time, post photos of yourself there. If you like fishing, post pictures of yourself on a boat with a dead fish. If you like hiking, post pictures of yourself doing that. The woman will subconsciously think about if she can see herself in that photo with you. If your photos don't show yourself doing anything, it'll look like you have no interests at all. reply hnthroaway992 46 minutes agorootparentDoesn't that have a slight problem for someone genuinely has no interests whatsoever?

If you ever want to know how insidious they are, just download one, finish your profile, and swipe for 10 minutes a week. Since you are not an \"active user\" they will give you the most attractive people to swipe on. Every couple of days they will give you a \"limited time\" discount on gold or platinum or whatever. The push notifications are my favorite part, \"you could be missing out on the love of your life!!!\". Not to mention the interactions with the UI are littered with casino like visuals. The whole purpose of the app is to get you addicted and spending time and money on it. It's much easier to naturally meet people in real life through work/school. If you can't there, go hang out at coffee shops or bookstores or something and just hang. Strike up conversation with people, just live.

Especially if the \"quitting\" does not occur in amicable circumstances. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentYou wouldn’t get a chance to quit either one, probably. The job might fire the accuser - they might have an incentive to investigate. At the gym you might get arrested and then banned, with no one interested in doing followup to figure out the actual truth - just have you released after it was clear it was fake. The gym wouldn't want anything to do with you either way afterwards. reply jstarfish 10 hours agorootparentprevOf course. It works at every level, all the way down to family. Other advice here suggests joining groups to meet people, but anytime you two are under the same reporting umbrella, you're vulnerable to malicious claims when they want to be rid of you. It's a sad state of affairs; I don't have a solution. Private citizens have no business running tribal justice systems. They used to call this form of abuse triangulation (but that term has a wildly different meaning with this crowd). https://www.healthline.com/health/narcissistic-triangulation reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentNear as I can tell, the way this usually works out is each gender ends up 'policing' itself to prevent the worst abuses. In most environments, the older women police the younger women, older men police the younger men, etc. Good luck doing that online though, or even in the current dynamic. reply itronitron 13 hours agorootparentprevI think the mindset should be that whoever you initially meet, or hang out with, won't be a match but may potentially introduce you to a person with whom you could match. So all coworkers then are excluded from the dating pool, but are potential matchmakers. reply herbst 1 hour agoparentprevYou are talking specifically about the male experience. As 'female' it doesn't matter how often I use the app, if my profile attracts enough males I get matches and ice breakers all day long. If I accidentally open the app after 2 months it just gets more. I don't need to match or look out. I get nice and stupid messages in mailbox and can choose from them. If I go to match 80% (made up but realistic number) of the profiles shown already matched with me. The apps don't want me to buy anything, they nag me for my time. I could go on. By design I will only see the most successful or 'aggresive' profiles and nothing else. reply TruthSeeking 8 hours agoprevDating apps are a world of abundance, a buffet of sausages for women. For men they are a pit of hell, unless you're either (1) in the top 10% (2) have low standards. Here are some Tinder stats [1] - a man of average attractiveness is “liked” by approximately 0.87% (1 in 115) of women on Tinder. - the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. Anecdotally I have never had anything remotely resembling \"success\" on a dating app. I almost never get matches, my messages almost never get replies, and even when I get to the point of scheduling a date, they virtually always drop off. And then even when they agree to a date, they often cancel on the day of, and on multiple occasions even block me. In real life meeting women in person, I've ever had any issues with dating. It annoys me that people speak of \"dating apps\" collectively without addressing the enormous discrepancy between the male and female experience on them. It's analogous to speaking about the pros and cons of something like monarchy without considering that your experience of monarchy is going to drastically depend on whether you're the king or his subjects. I don't really see a solution either. Men need to get off the apps and meet women in person, because otherwise they're fighting for the bottom of the barrel (I don't say this to put anyone down - the point is that you're going to have access to way better quality as a man if you meet people in real life). [1] https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-g... reply charliebwrites 13 hours agoprevUntil dating apps explicitly measure success in terms of matches made and users deleting the app at all levels of their business, the quality of their products will suffer If a product team is incentivized to bring in revenue over creating long term relationships, then it will always make decisions that sacrifice the latter for the former Investors need to understand and accept that these business measure success in that way or find a different stock Otherwise the apps will have a slow trickle of users leaving after a slew of mediocre first dates or little to no high quality matches reply fireflash38 12 hours agoparentI've kind of wondered how you would structure something to have incentives line up. Sign a contract saying you pay nothing for as long as you are actively swiping/matching/communicating, but if you stop for 1-2 months you have to pay? Rather feels bad... but maybe the 'lucky' users would be more willing to pay since they found someone? As it currently is & the article describes, current dating app revenue feels super scummy from top to bottom. Maybe even a discount/refund if you come back to the app after a month or two off :D reply potatochup 9 hours agorootparentFine if you can assume honest users... But otherwise people would just keep the app around to not pay despite finding someone. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentprevYou might as well ask how you could make whiskey healthy. It’s not. That’s the point. reply solatic 18 hours agoprevIt's only a paradox until you realize that dating apps would shoot themselves in the foot with such a user-hostile model, trashing their brand. Hanlon's Razor directs us to the simpler explanation, which is that 90% of people on dating markets stay on dating markets; for which there are many, many highly personalized reasons. No dating app can fix its users' mindsets. There are three rules on dating apps, and they haven't changed in the last couple of decades: be attractive, don't be unattractive, and inject humor. The fourth rule is to remember that if you want to be treated like a customer then make sure you pay for the product rather than being the product; the fifth rule is to have patience over things outside of your control. reply pc86 13 hours agoparentI found my wife on Hinge in a suburban-bordering-rural part of the country (so not a lot of people on the apps in absolute terms) right before its acquisition and actually had better success broadly speaking on Bumble. The trick was, unfortunately, to pay for it. Have super likes or whatever they're called. Pay for the membership to see people who like me without having to swipe. Pay to boost my profile so more people see it and potentially like it. The worst part (for me), actually spend time curating photos and writing thoughtful answers to things - the former being much more important than the latter. Even with all of this I'd hit nights where I had seemingly swiped one way or the other on every eligible bachelorette within 100 miles. Maybe I had. Unfortunately I don't have any reproducible or generalizable advice from meeting my wife. She was my only match on Hinge, neither of us paid for it, and we moved to phone conversation and dates within 48 hours. reply 015a 12 hours agoparentprevI really like this take, and I think it becomes extremely self-evident once you think about it for a bit, and talk with people who use dating apps IRL. \"Dating apps are incentivized to keep people going on mediocre first dates\" is such a tired take that would require such incredible sophistication and secrecy to pull off, \"we can't make the matches too shitty, but we also can't make them too good, damn it Jim that match was too high quality! now they'll stop paying!\" its comic book villain stuff that cannot possibly explain why all of these apps suck. \"For which there are many highly personalized reasons\" -> Look, yes people are responsible for their own mindsets. But in the words of a recent tweet (I wish I could cite but I can't find it) concerning learning comprehension tanking in K-12 students: Its Phones! Its just phones. Its obviously phones! You hear this crap like \"well, its a highly complicated situation with many variables and possible explanations\" Nope! Its literally just phones! Dating is hard, weird, and scary. Its one of the most vulnerable things humans do. We're putting kids on a dopamine treadmill from childhood, and we're surprised that, at best, we've got cohorts of individuals growing up who love the matching but stop when it gets any more di",
