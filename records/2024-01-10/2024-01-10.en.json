    "originBody": "How I pwned half of America’s fast food chains, simultaneously. Also checkout Eva’s blogpost of this event. With an upbeat pling my console alerted me that my script had finished running, to be precise it was searching for exposed Firebase credentials on any of the hundreds of recent AI startups. This was achieved through a public list of sites using the .ai TLD and parsing the site data (and any referenced .js bundles) for references to common Firebase initialisation variables. Production: { apiKey: \"AIza\", authDomain: \"KFC.firebaseapp.com\", databaseURL: \"https://KFC.firebaseio.com\", projectId: \"KFC\", storageBucket: \"KFC.appspot.com\", messagingSenderId: \"123456789\" } My hunch was that in the rush to push their new shiny product, someone would take a shortcut and forget to implement proper security rules. The hunch was right, and it was worse than I could’ve ever guessed. Meet Chattr.ai …The self proclaimed AI hiring system that claims to shave 88% of the time off hiring new people. They provide their services to a massive number of fast food chains and other hourly employers around the United States, including but not limited to: Applebees Arbys Chickfila Dunkin IHOP KFC Shoneys Subway Tacobell Target Wendys The Vulnerability If you drop the Firebase configuration from the JS bundle into Firepwn, you start out with zero permissions as you can see in the following screenshot. But if you use Firebase’s registration feature to create a new user (you cannot register on their site), you get full privileges (read/write) to the Firebase DB. The data it exposes includes and is not limited to: Names Phone numbers Emails Plaintext passwords (Only some account’s had exposed passwords) Locations of branches Confidential messages Shifts For the following: Chattr employees Franchisee managers Job applicants It Gets… Worse?! Yeah, it somehow manages to get even worse. If you grab the list of admin users from /orgs/0/users, you can splice a new entry into it giving you full access to their Administrator dashboard. As you can see below, it allows for even more control over their systems including accepting/denying applicants or even refunding payments made to Chattr.

Seems they had not tweaked the database rules correctly, maybe even left the default setup! That means you could have executed this:Firebase.database().ref(&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;).set(&#x27;All your data is gone&#x27;).Better yet, download the whole DB and then:Firebase.database().ref(&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;).set(&#x27;I have all your data, pay me to get it back&#x27;). reply Sparkyte 31 minutes agoprevEthical hacking is a good thing.Nice to see someone doing good. reply j-bos 8 hours agoprevIf this had been exploited and the job applicants to Target, Subway, Dunkin et al, had bank&#x2F;credit fraud committed in their name&#x27;s, would the big companies be liable for not performing due dilligence on chatter.ai? To be clear, I&#x27;m asking from a legal standpoint not a practical one. reply n2d4 7 hours agoparentFor more crucial PII (such as SSN, health data, payment info, etc), vendors are generally required to have certifications from a third-party auditor (such as SOC2). If the big companies fail to check that, then yes, they can be made liable. reply adrr 4 hours agorootparentNo rules or laws that require it. Closest requirement would be PCI around credit cards but you need lots of volume to be required to do an audit. HIPPA just requires you to do risk analysis and implement risk management. SOX is up to the auditor, when I was CTO at a public company, they were fine with me signing at attestation of all things we had implemented. Same with banks, no explicit requirement in both glba and fdic rules. Core bank systems are so old, none of that data is even encrypted neither is network traffic. Stuff is still in cobol.Forcing function would be cyberinsurance policies that typically want to see audit results if you have multi-million dollar policy limits. reply l33t7332273 3 hours agorootparentI think the fact that this is true and well known(amongst those that could abuse it) is evidence that infosec, by and large, is overemphasized. reply callalex 2 hours agoparentprevSomeone applying to work at Taco Bell or Subway couldn’t afford a lawyer even if they worked for a full year and saved every penny. reply MrBruh 8 hours agoparentprevProbably yeah, although it just comes down to if they get Sued or not I guess.NOTE: I am not a legal professional, just making my guess. reply speps 8 hours agoprevWho&#x27;s to say they&#x27;re the first to discover this?

(If there are ways I can improve my writing) reply listenallyall 2 hours agorootparentArticle was good, and your instincts proved correct -- but if you want some truthful feedback, your headline is clickbait. You pwned a single vendor that happens to work with some fast food restaurants, you did not find a vulnerability within the restaurant companies themselves. \"I pwned an applicant management system\" is a lot less compelling than the headline you used. reply howon92 3 hours agorootparentprevMy feedback: keep the same style :) reply cedws 7 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s not clear if the author was hired to do this pentest or is a guerilla&#x2F;good samaritan. If it is indeed the latter, I wonder how they are so brazen about it. Does chattr.ai have a responsible disclosure policy?In my eyes people should be free to pentest whatever as long as there is no intent to cause harm and any findings are reported. Sadly, many companies will freak out and get the law involved, even if you are a good samaritan. reply KomoD 7 hours agoparent> It&#x27;s not clear if the author was hired to do this pentest or is a guerilla&#x2F;good samaritanPretty clear to me, \"it was searching for exposed Firebase credentials on any of the hundreds of recent AI startups.\", running a script to scan hundreds of startups> Sadly, many companies will freak out and get the law involved, even if you are a good samaritan.Yeah, but that also ends with that company being shamed a lot of the time reply pests 7 hours agorootparentWhat is wrong with shaming when it&#x27;s warranted? reply redcobra762 6 hours agorootparentIt’s an ineffective tool if your goal is change. reply Eisenstein 2 hours agorootparentShame is absolutely a valuable tool for change. Without it society would not function since many of our &#x27;rules&#x27; are self-enforced. reply redcobra762 2 hours agorootparentNope, shame is ineffective as a tool for change. More often people shut down or ignore you if you attempt to shame them than actually make the change you want. Besides, it&#x27;s frequently just about vengeance anyway. Shame is really hate of other, for the most part.As a tool for oppression however, yes it&#x27;s quite effective. reply bryanrasmussen 54 minutes agorootparent>More often people shut down or ignore you if you attempt to shame them than actually make the change you want.shame as a tool of change does not work on the person being shamed at the time, it works on that person for the future hopefully as they will be afraid to be shamed again and it works on changing the behavior of other peoples because they don&#x27;t want to get shamed either.Thus as a tool of oppression, as you pointed out, it works great. But also as a tool for enforcing otherwise non-enforced social rules - until of course you meet someone shameless or who feels at least that they can effectively argue against the shaming. reply Eisenstein 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are different types of shame. Shame related to a decision situation (endogenous) and shame not related to a decision situation (exogenous). In the endogenous case the shame is said to be a &#x27;pro-social&#x27; emotion.This is backed by studies.\"Using three different emotion inductions and two different dependent measures, we repeatedly found that endogenous shame motivates prosocial behavior. After imagining shame with a scenario, proself participants acted more prosocially toward the audience in a social dilemma game (Experiment 1). This finding was replicated when participants recalled a shame event (Experiment 2). Moreover, when experiencing shame after a failure on performance tasks, proself participants also acted prosocially toward the audience in the lab (Experiment 3). Finally, Experiment 4 showed that this effect could be generalized beyond social dilemmas to helping tendencies in everyday situations. Therefore, it seems safe to conclude that shame can be seen as a moral emotion motivating prosocial behavior.\" [1]You can also contrast &#x27;humiliation&#x27; shame with &#x27;moral shame&#x27;, with moral shame being prosocial. This is also backed by studies.\"Our data show that the common conception of shame as a universally maladaptive emotion does not capture fully the diversity of motivations with which it is connected. Shame that arises from a tarnished social image is indeed associated with avoidance, anger, cover-up, and victim blame, and is likely to have negative effects on intergroup relations. However, shame that arises in response to violations of the ingroup’s valued moral essence is strongly associated with a positive pattern of responses and is likely to have positive effects on intergroup relations.\"[2][1] de Hooge, I.

It is negligent. replyxxs 3 hours agorootparentprevPlain text passwords, seriously. At that point, I&#x27;m not sure what would be a similarity with any other engineering profession. The plain text passwords are beyond any rhyme or reason... and then returned to the end user client. If anything, I&#x27;d consider it malicious negligence - in the EU the leak would be a GDPR issue as well. reply MrBruh 2 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t worry, it was only a couple passwords for their admin accounts. reply refulgentis 4 hours agorootparentprevRead their partner&#x27;s post they link to, the way they put it, they were hanging out in a chat, \"remembered chattr.ai\" and then downloaded a Firebase pwn GUI. No mention of scanning .ai domains or anything of the like. That combined with the odd self-promotion of \"half of America&#x27;s fast food chains\" (?), leads me to a rather negative assessment of intentions and talent here. reply MrBruh 7 hours agoparentprev> Good SamaritanThe web is insecure enough as it is, I just want to do my part to make it that little bit safer :) reply cedws 7 hours agorootparentI salute you for it. Take caution though.The bad guys don&#x27;t play by the rules so the rules only hinder the good guys from helping. I think Internet security would be in a better position if we had legislation to protect good samaritan pentesters. Even moreso if they were appropriately rewarded. reply nkrisc 7 hours agorootparentWhy, you’d never catch a black hat hacker again. The authorities would ust reeling in one Good Samaritan after another! reply cedws 7 hours agorootparentThere is a big difference between discovering a vulnerability that allows you to forge tokens and immediately reporting it versus dumping terabytes of data on the darknet for sale. reply eyegor 4 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, door 1 is maybe $200 bounty and weeks or months of back and forth (if the corp doesn&#x27;t have a clear bounty program) whereas door 2 has infinite upside. Honestly, it might make sense for a gov group to run a standardized bounty program for exploits with notable financial &#x2F; privacy impact. reply DANmode 3 hours agorootparentGiving corps even more excuse not to run proper bug bounties,or care even less about shipping secure code?Pass. reply Eisenstein 2 hours agorootparentprevThe solution is to have fines in place for insecurities and award them to discoverers. reply Geisterde 27 minutes agorootparentWhat a wonderful idea. Im sure our nobel politicians will ignore their donors this time and craft legislation that puts large companies at constant threat of more fines. This could never be weaponized against small businesses that pose competition to the bigger fish. replymmsc 7 hours agorootparentprevEverybody has that goal until they get a knock on their door at 6am: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;disclose&#x2F;research-threats reply pharrington 4 hours agorootparentprevFrom one Paul to another, best of luck! For the goal of improving overall web security, widespread shame doesn&#x27;t work. My hunch is that we need to be more prideful about having verifiably robust security practices. Kind of like getting corporations to realize that the data is more valuable if you can prove that nobody can breach it. reply MrBruh 3 hours agorootparentThank you, the kindness goes a long way! reply nigamanth 6 hours agorootparentprevDoes this bug work across all applications that use Firebase? Or just those that didn&#x27;t push the update with security? reply ericalexander0 7 hours agoparentprevSometimes these events provoke regulators to take a closer look at the company.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;... reply jjeaff 4 hours agoparentprevDo you feel the same about physical security?

Say you have a filing cabinet with all of your important and \\ or embarrassing documents in it. Are you OK with houseguests giving the handle a little wiggle when they come over to check if its locked? What about the neighborhood kids? reply prmoustache 3 hours agorootparentA closer analogy would be your friendly neighbour warning you that you left your garage door open. And yes I would appreciate him telling me. reply jpc0 1 hour agorootparentprevThis analogy is more akin to exposing your database to to public internet with no credentials or weak credentials. Thinking about it just like the company in the blog post did... Oh and the filing cabinet is out on the street corner as the other commenter mentioned.As someone else mentioned this would be more akin to a security officer of some sort waking me up and letting me know I left my front door open. I&#x27;d sure as hell be shaken but they were doing their job and I&#x27;d be thankful for that. reply wuiheerfoj 4 hours agorootparentprevIf I left my filing cabinet on the pavement outside my house, I ought to expect it to happen, and would thank a good samaritan telling me if I left it open replytheonething 2 hours agoprev> If you grab the list of admin users from &#x2F;orgs&#x2F;0&#x2F;users, you can splice a new entry into it giving you full access to their Administrator dashboard.I&#x27;m not clear on this.

And then do what with it? reply iamflimflam1 2 hours agoparentOnce he had access to Firebase (the database) he was able to add an entry to the list of admin users. With that done he could login as an admin user to the website and access the administrator dashboard. reply urbandw311er 1 hour agoparentprevI read this as worse - splice being a client side JavaScript function to add items to arrays. My concern here is whether the “is admin user” perms checks were done solely on the client side and not enforced on the API endpoint! reply 8organicbits 1 hour agoprevI would have stopped once I confirmed the leaked keys were valid. Looking at what types of data you had access to wasn&#x27;t required. Downloading plaintext passwords of other people is probably too far. Impacted users may need to be notified about a breach. If needed, create an account of your own and target only that.If there was a pentester agreement, safe harbor, or other protection that&#x27;s different. Be careful out there. reply Topfi 52 minutes agoparent> Looking at what types of data you had access to wasn&#x27;t required. Downloading plaintext passwords of other people is probably too far. Impacted users may need to be notified about a breach. If needed, create an account of your own and target only that.I&#x27;d argue that it was absolutely necessary to gauge the severity of this misconfiguration and furthermore, that Chattr.ai must contact every affected user, not MrBruh.Their configuration allowed anyone to create an account and access plaintext passwords. There is no telling whether and how many outside of this disclosure have previously accessed this information and may intend to use it. This was negligence of the highest order, and it shouldn&#x27;t be on the one finding and reporting this issue to rectify it. reply zilti 21 minutes agorootparentThat is not just negligence, that is stupidity on an order of magnitude that the responsible people should never again be allowed to work on a software project. reply denysvitali 1 hour agoparentprevI would argue that looking at the type of data you&#x27;re dealing with is actually a very important part to assess the impact, but looking at the data itself is beyond this part.Knowing that they store passwords in plaintext is a security issue on top of the R&#x2F;W credential reply zharknado 3 hours agoprevFrom Eva’s post:> we didnt know much about firebase at the time so we simply tried to find a tool to see if it was vulnerable to something obvious and we found firepwn, which seemed nice for a GUI tool, so we simply entered the details of chattr&#x27;s firebaseGenuinely curious (I’ve no infosec experience), wouldn’t there be a risk that a tool like this could phone home and log everything you find while doing research? reply bushbaba 3 hours agoparentYes, but that might also be caught by infosec users of said tool who have things similar to “littlesnitch” alerting them to the outbound API call attempt. reply genewitch 2 hours agorootparentthere used to be windows GUIs for forcing new connections to ask, but i haven&#x27;t seen anything like it. I can&#x27;t recall the name of the one i used to use, but it scored perfectly on shieldsUp - oh, Zone Alarm.Littlesnitch iirc is macos only, but it sounds lovely for this sort of thing. reply callalex 2 hours agorootparentThe generic term is “outbound firewall”. reply Geisterde 21 minutes agoparentprevThat would be referred to as a honeypot. Sometimes administrators will set up their own honeypots to see the type of threats they are facing. reply sunbum 14 minutes agorootparentNo, a honeypot is intentionally insecure infrastructure setup to see who and how it gets attacked.

That makes me uneasy. reply throwaway0665 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve seen many many firebase projects with rules disabling access only if \"auth != null\" instead of implementing some kind of even rudimentary access controls. It&#x27;s a very dangerous habit that seems to come straight from the firebase docs[1]:> When the user requesting access isn&#x27;t signed in, the auth variable is null. You can leverage this in your rules if, for example, you want to limit read access to authenticated users — auth != null. However, we generally recommend limiting write access further.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firebase.google.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;rules&#x2F;rules-and-auth reply n2d4 8 hours agorootparentprevWhen you create the database, you&#x27;re asked whether you want to give everyone access (development mode), or whether no one gets it (production mode). If you choose the development mode, it will automatically disable that access after a certain timestamp, so you don&#x27;t forget to update it before shipping. This of course doesn&#x27;t stop people who don&#x27;t care about security from just manually giving out public R&#x2F;W, or extending the timestamp. reply intern4tional 8 hours agoprevThis isn’t owning fast food chains; rather compromising some AI startup that has some of them as a customer.Title is misleading. reply MrBruh 8 hours agoparentIt exposed PII of the managers & employees of ~half of the most popular fast food companies.Personally I feel the title is justified but I understand and respect your viewpoint.Also keep in mind that trying to clarify the such would also make the title much longer than I desired. reply intern4tional 6 hours agorootparentTitle: I pwned Chattr.ai via Firebase misconfigurationThat’s what you should call it.

I say this as someone who really tried to like it and sadly built a project for a client using it.Other than this security vuln, the issues vs. just using postgres are:* It is more work! Despite being a backend as a service it is much less code to just write a simple API backend for your thing both in time to do it and time to learn how to do it. Think of Firebase as being on the abstraction level of Sinatra or express and you may as well just use those. Things like Firebase and Parse etc. are more complicated. For the same reason it is more complicate to walk to work with just your arms and no legs (even though there are fewer limbs to deal with and no backend!).* Relational is king. Not being able to do joins really sucks. Yes you need to make async calls in a loop. NoSQL is premature optimisation.* Lots of Googlization. This means lots of weird, hard to find out clickops configuration steps to get anything working. Probably why this security flaw existed(?).* Emulator is flakey, so for local dev you need another cloud DB, and yes all that Googlized setup RSI inducing clickops.* I reckon it is slower than postgres at the scale of starting a project. Traditional architecture are blitz fast on modern hardware and internet. Like playing a 90s game on your laptop.* Apparently as you scale it gets pretty pricey.The main thing is: it actually slows you down! The whole premise is this should speed you up. reply laurieg 6 hours agoparentThe flakey firebase local emulator is the bane of my existence, and poorly documented to boot.On top of the Googlized clickops, there&#x27;s the whole Firebase vs Google cloud situation, where you end up having to drop down to \"real\" google cloud for certain specific features. The docs appear to be detailed but you often end up with more questions than answers.If you are ever thinking about using firebase, give Supabase a try. The emulator works well, the dashboard is there for prototyping but you can just write SQL to clearly define your database and migrations. Since it&#x27;s just postgres you have a clear route to leave Supabase if you should ever want to. reply habosa 5 hours agorootparentJust curious, what’s flakey about it?I’m not at Google anymore but I was a core contributor to the Firebase emulators project when I was. I can think of many flaws with the emulators but flakey is a new one to me reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentIt often just crashed with an error. Now I am a Windows user, so MMMV, and this might be the reason. In some places the behaviour was slightly different and I had to work around that. I don&#x27;t recall the specifics. And the idea of a test suite that starts the emulator, runs the tests and gives a result, that can reliably run.... well I gave up on that. reply eddiewithzato 6 hours agoparentprevAll roads lead back to RDBMS, it&#x27;s amazing how this piece of theory just works. reply SkyMarshal 5 hours agorootparent> this piece of theoryKey words right there. The relational model is a timeless mathematical model for data that gains both logical consistency and adaptability as a result. It has and will continue to stand the test of time. reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentAnd in practice it has a superpower: agility. The pointy haired boss wants your OLTP to be an OLAP, and you can kind of hack it. You want to put the user&#x27;s birthday on the settings page this quarter? Sure. Even if that is in another table. You can even make it efficient. reply giantg2 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m coming to this conclusion as well.Something like DynamoDB can be great for simple data. I liked the idea of Graphql (technically the API query and not the database). Both of them turn into hot garbage once you get into complex data, especially if it&#x27;s being aggregated from multiple sources. Or maybe the systems I work with just implemented them poorly. reply randomdata 5 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, the roads lead back to SQL. It deviates from the relational model. It may even be that SQL was successful because it deviated from the relational model.

If you \"just use Postgres\", life is simpler until your user goes offline&#x2F;runs out of mobile data&#x2F;whatever, and then they&#x27;re immediately screwed. reply ochiba 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worth noting that Firebase doesn&#x27;t have a true offline-first architecture, but rather cloud-first: By default, queries run against the cloud and results of those specific queries are temporarily cached on the client. By default Firestore will try to reach the server first before falling back to the local cache, which can result in a subpar UX on a patch network connection. It does also provide store-and-forward of updates from client to server. But it&#x27;s not a true offline-first architecture since it does not preemptively sync a database to the local user device for offline-by-default access.Regarding Postgres, that is where tools like PowerSync (disclosure: co-founder) and ElectricSQL are useful, which are both sync layers for Postgres for offline-first architecture. reply lukevp 7 hours agorootparentprevMost apps are online by default these days and don’t even gracefully degrade without internet. Firebase does have the offline DB, but it had a ton of more features and I wouldn’t say the offline db is the only selling point of FB. reply joshspankit 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is the exact use-case I want to optimize for.

If you’re using relational data with a key value store you’re doing it wrong. You can do anything you can do with a relational database with a key value store, but there are trade offs since now you have to heavily denormalize for performance and figure out how to keep things reasonably consistent.Firebase is not an alternative to Postgres alone. You need an actual API server. The value of Firebase is you don’t need that, nor do you need to worry about ops, authentication, queues or other things.The issue the OP found could have been easily fixed by simply reading the docs, but that seems to be a rare activity these days. reply quickthrower2 7 hours agorootparentThere is no such thing as “relational data” here. There is the data I need to store to implement my app. No matter how I shaped it, it was suboptimal. Where it might shine is a subsystem like chat with just messages. Oh just got a flashback about Firebase rules. That alone is a time sink where you could have got the project done in Rails already :-)The hard work of using Firebase’s apis, libraries, reading it’s docs (which are detailed but badly organized) is more than the delta between not needing a backend. And for a non trivial app you will end up using functions: infact if you want a guarantee that your user has a name then you will need to write a function. And that is… a backend, like writing an app.route statement. reply hot_gril 7 hours agorootparentWhile NodeJS+Postgres is my go-to, I think it&#x27;s harder than you&#x27;re making it sound. Firebase would probably be easier for someone who&#x27;s new to this altogether or somewhere in between.There&#x27;s still nothing that holds your hand through a proper client-server interface, good relational schema design, and all the glue in between. Partially because nobody agrees on what those are. reply endisneigh 7 hours agorootparentprevFrom this post I can tell you’re not really understanding how Firebase is supposed to be used, which is fine. For you it’s better to use the traditional approach with database and app server.And yes, there is such a thing as relational data. If you do not believe this then you really shouldn’t use Firebase (or dynamodb for that matter). reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentI know I am holding it wrong etc! But I really tried in earnest, as a fanboy of firebase, for quite a long time. The problems I had were with basic things. You have companies, a company can have many users, users might belong to more than one company (hello Slack...) and then there can be relationship between users.Putting aside the problem between chair & keyboard.Another difference is more if you make a mistake in your relational schema, you can SQL your way out of it - add an extra join or group by. And you can also fairly easily migrate you way out of it to a new schema that is the right structure.This requires actual code with firebase, and a lot of patience, and probably a lot more downtime. So you need more of a waterfall approach, I would suggest, to design a schema ahead of time, and know all of your requirements. NoSQL document-oriented schemas just aren&#x27;t flexible (unless the DB supports something like materialized views to help you get out of it) reply hot_gril 7 hours agoparentprevFirebase is a whole platform with auth, file storage, functions, etc besides just its DB feature, but maybe this wasn&#x27;t always the case. Anyway, yes, I don&#x27;t look past Postgres unless I have a very specific reason. reply ufmace 5 hours agoparentprevMaybe I&#x27;m like a Luddite or something, but I feel like I keep hearing about Firebase but still have no idea what it really is or why&#x2F;how I would use it in a project. I&#x27;m just sitting here on my own building projects with mostly Postgresql DBs, once in a while MySQL, and not suffering massive security breaches. Thanks I suppose for giving me a data point that I&#x27;m most likely not missing anything. reply ElFitz 4 hours agorootparentIt’s a hands—off database and auth service, initially intended to be directly accessed by thick clients, with little to no backend logic (although they have since added FaaS).When mobile apps started out, most had little to no online features.As the mobile apps market grew, more and more of these apps started requiring account persistence, sharing content with other users, real-time online interactions, etc.That&#x27;s when Backend as a Service became a thing (eg Parse), targeting developers with little to no server-side experience. And that&#x27;s when Firebase popped up. reply TheAceOfHearts 5 hours agoparentprevWhen I was evaluating Firebase a few years back, the thing that most annoyed me was that their frontend library wasn&#x27;t open source. Google just shipped an obfuscated and minified JS library. The lack of source mixed with their terrible docs made it a non-starter for me.I remember having some issue, and thought: well, it&#x27;s JS, let me just check the source like I normally would! Only to find out that you couldn&#x27;t browse the full client source code anywhere. At that point my only option was to reverse engineer the minified source which just seemed silly and like a waste of time.Firebase moat has nothing to do with their frontend library, which anyone could reverse engineer with a little bit of time. And yet they still kept it closed source. I don&#x27;t know if anything has changed since then, but that was the primary reason why I lost interest in the service. reply refulgentis 7 hours agoparentprevSupabase is the iPhone to Firebase&#x27;s Palm V -- highly recommend, if you&#x27;re a fellow millenial like me who grew up on mobile, and things like \"much less code to just write a simple API backend for your thing\" sounds like 6 months and paying another engineer.EDIT:loud buzzerCareful, Icarus: \"permissions can be setup to allow global read-writes\" is a \"vuln\" of every system.p.s.

(Firebase defaults to no access in production mode.) reply asciimike 5 hours agorootparent> Firebase was very clearly designed with this in mindYes and no ;)The original release of the Realtime Database didn&#x27;t have security rules (though they were thought of at the time), and they were added in late 2013&#x2F;early 2014 (IIRC). At that point, in the name of \"easier getting started experience (don&#x27;t force users to learn a custom DSL)\", the default rules were `read: true, write: true`. As you might expect, it resulted in a high potential for this type of thing, and sophisticated customers cared _a lot_ about this.This changed at some point post acquisition (probably 2016?) when the tradeoff between developer experience and customer security switched over to `false&#x2F;false` (or picking something slightly more secure than `true&#x2F;true`.Firebase Security Rules were upgraded and added to Firebase (Cloud) Storage and Firestore, with both integrations being first class integrations, as _the whole point_ of those products was secure client-side access directly to the database from day 1.The tricky part of all of any system in this space was designing a system that&#x27;s simple enough to learn, highly performant, and also sufficiently flexible so as to answer the question \"allow authentication based on $PHASE_OF_THE_MOON == WAXING_GIBBOUS\" or some other sufficiently arbitrary enterprise parameter. Most BaaS products at the time optimized for the former, then the latter, and mostly not the flexibility; however, over time, it turns out that sufficiently large customers really only care about the last one! Looks like Firebase solved this recently with auth \"blocking functions\" (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firebase.google.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;auth&#x2F;extend-with-blocking-f...) which is sort of similar to Lambda Authorizers (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;apigateway&#x2F;latest&#x2F;developerguide...), which I believe is a pretty good way of solving this problem.Disclosure: Firebase PM from long ago reply Sai_ 7 hours agorootparentprevDon’t believe tables are readable by default even if you have defined any RLS policies for that table. I’m building something on SB right now and have been burned more than once because I thought that the absence of policy meant open access to everyone. reply n2d4 7 hours agorootparentI just checked, and newly created tables without RLS are accessible to anyone: After running `CREATE TABLE x` in my SQL client (which succeeds with no warning), if I go back to the table UI on Supabase it says \"WARNING: You are allowing anonymous access to your table\". (It&#x27;s good that there&#x27;s a warning in the official interface, at least, but what if I use my own SQL client? What if my ORM is creating tables?)Your confusion probably stems from how you can have RLS disabled, or RLS enabled with no policies. If you have RLS enabled with no policies, the access is restricted. But if RLS is disabled (or never enabled!), then your table is blasted to the entire internet.This confusion kind of proves my point; if DB access from untrusted clients were baked into SQL since birth, RLS would probably be enabled by default. reply nop_slide 5 hours agorootparentI don’t understand the RLS is disabled warning thing. I also have that warning on a project where I migrated to Supabase from a sql dump&#x2F;restore from another PG instance.I’m using supabase as “just Postgres” at the moment and the only access to the data comes from a server I control.Could you explain how my data is being “blasted to the internet”?Genuinely concerned if I’m grossly overlooking something. reply n2d4 4 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t use the client library (and never expose the anon key) you&#x27;re most likely fine. If you do (even if just for Supabase Auth or so) your data is exposed and you need to enable RLS on all affected tables ASAP or an attacker can access the entire database, in a similar fashion in which OP did that with Firebase. reply refulgentis 6 hours agorootparentprevThe \"when I create a table via SQL statements at shell it does what I say\" isn&#x27;t a vulnerability, I don&#x27;t think.The comment chain went long enough that I got confused and thought I was missing something, I started a brand new account, brand new project, brand new table, RLS is enabled by default, has a big recommended next to it highlighted, it is checked, the entire section is highlighted, and has documentation right below it. Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;X9oJ2i9It&#x27;s enabled by default, quite forcefully sobut I&#x27;m not a Postgres admin, maybe there&#x27;s a stronger way you know of to enforce it, so you can prevent the footgun of CREATE TABLE? reply n2d4 6 hours agorootparentI mean, I don&#x27;t disagree, but what I&#x27;m saying is that SQL&#x2F;Postgres (hence also Supabase) was not designed for databases accessed from untrusted clients, instead, it&#x27;s an afterthought and it shows.Whether it&#x27;s a \"vulnerability\" or by design is another question, but it&#x27;s definitely a footgun (particularly for new Supabase users that use an ORM like Prisma, which has its own UI and creates tables by itself).The solution might just be to not let untrusted clients access your DB. reply anoncareer0212 7 hours agorootparentprevIn what way do you perceive it to be an after thought?It&#x27;s front-and-center constantly, and has _all_ access disabled by default on tables every time I use it. reply n2d4 7 hours agorootparentIt only has access disabled if you enable RLS on that table. If you do `CREATE TABLE`, or don&#x27;t check the checkbox in the UI (TBF it&#x27;s big and green and has a warning that&#x27;s hard to miss), then access is public.I guess my main concern is that it&#x27;s hard to setup RLS correctly using SQL. Because it&#x27;s two separate statements, if your `CREATE TABLE` succeeds, but the `CREATE POLICY` does not, you&#x27;re also exposed. And it is more annoying than it should&#x27;ve been to test the rules (Firebase has a dedicated tool for that).I now just use Supabase to host a normal Postgres that only my backend connects to. That works well. reply bravura 5 hours agorootparentI built a supabase app the past two days, and I agree.I did find it a footgun that creating a table through SQL was not private by default. (Why doesn&#x27;t Supabase apply RLS by default to tables created through SQL?)Serverless also turned out to be more trouble than it was worth. In particular:* Doing DB business logic in JS is gross.* It&#x27;s tricky to secure a table to be semi-public. e.g. you have a bookmark site and you don&#x27;t want users to browse all URLs, just the ones they have bookmarked. The best solution appears to be disabling foreign-keys until transactions are done and then having a complicated policy.* It&#x27;s a pain to set up a CLI client that interacts with the DB. I think you have to copy-paste the access AND refresh tokens to it. I couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to create my own API tokens.A backend is nice, because it is private by default. reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;ll happily take 6 months pay to knock up a quick node api. :-). Just need to find a beach first.What I found is you are right and FB is easier for the Millennial, Gen Z, Boomer or whatever IF everything you need can be done by rules and schema.As soon as you need to write functions (because rules are not sophisticated enough or too slow&#x2F;expensive, or you want to know why the thing got denied) then you are writing backend code.It is actually easier to write the same code in a NextJS template - like there is less to learn, less docs to read. And then chuck it on Vercel which will deploy and devops it for you. So you have all the devops done for you like Firebase would and you have spent less time. Now if you are talking to postgres instead of firebase from the backend, it is actually easier IMO. A line to connect to pg. A line to issue a query.Guess this is just my opinion, but it is less code to do so, less environment variable farting around, downloading a weird .json with all the credentials. If I were inclined I would write a blog post showing how much less lines of code are needed, how much less understanding is needed, and with the managed infra&#x2F;DB offered by Vercel etc. you are still serverless, etc. reply codesnik 5 hours agorootparentprevUsed it and can&#x27;t actually recommend it. RLS policies slows down even simplest queries 1000x times sometimes, and postgres&#x27; current EXPLAIN ANALYZE isn&#x27;t helping much. Testing app on it is still a pain. Default migration engine is oneway. Backed in database backups are close to useless.

My concerns center on the recent exemption request by Boeing for its 737 MAX aircraft, which is particularly alarming in light of the explosive decompression event that occurred last Friday.The 737 MAX has a controversial history, marked by two catastrophic accidents that led to a global grounding of the fleet. Despite modifications and enhancements to address these issues, the recent exemption request by Boeing raises questions about the aircraft&#x27;s safety standards. The exemption, if granted, could potentially allow Boeing to bypass certain regulatory requirements, which I fear might compromise passenger safety.The incident last Friday, involving an explosive decompression event, is a stark reminder of the unforeseen risks inherent in aviation. This occurrence underscores the need for stringent safety measures and regulations that should not be compromised or waived. It is imperative that any exemptions to standard aviation safety procedures be scrutinized with utmost diligence to prevent any compromise on safety.As my representative in Congress, I urge you to closely monitor this situation and take appropriate actions to ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not grant exemptions that could endanger public safety. It is crucial that the FAA maintains its rigorous standards to safeguard the lives of passengers and crew.Our priority must be the safety and well-being of everyone who flies. I trust that you will consider this matter with the seriousness it deserves and represent the concerns of your constituents in this crucial matter.Thank you for your attention to this important issue. I look forward to your response and the actions you will take regarding this matter.Sincerely,[YOUR NAME] reply barryrandall 12 hours agoparentprevBut cross-reference that with OpenSecrets to see if it&#x27;s even worth pursuing.

There have been several airline explosive decompressions in the past 50 years. The fatal ones have each had one fatality, even with crazy damage to the plane (look up Aloha 243) If you figure this incident \"should\" have had one fatality, if you figure 100 passengers per flight, that&#x27;s a 1&#x2F;150,000,000 chance of dying.

Demand would swell well before price cuts made those planes uneconomical. reply Fischgericht 13 hours agoprevI find it puzzling that airlines are still ordering this plane.It&#x27;s not just us, the customers, who should \"vote with their feet\", but the airlines, too. I would not buy from a vendor that is not able to have a QA process that makes sure all screws and bolts are in place, fastened and secured. Even if it would not be an airplane where this is critical for safety, even if it would just be a toaster, I would stop buying.I would find it insulting as a customer to buy something for 50 Million USD to find out that the vendor was not willing to invest a little bit in QA. I understand that the 737 MAX is very cheap, but the damage to an airlines reputation, even if 90% of the customers do not care, should be priced in, which in the end makes it an expensive airplane.Looking at the number of quality and design issue problems Boeing had during the last couple of years, combined with the press attention they are getting now, I think we can take it for granted that during the next couple of months more such issues will be found, including the \"oops, that potentially could have crashed the airplane\" category.Also, I find it really insane that after all these issues the FAA still has not been reformed, properly staffed and funded. It really really should be clear by now that the system of Boeing doing the \"certification\" the FAA is supposed to be in charge of themselves.And finally: It goes beyond my comprehension that someone would decide to build a version of the voice recorder specifically for the US that only stores 2 hours of voice, while the international version of the same plane stores 25. What kind of cost reduction per unit is that, $1 per airplane? Having two different models to \"certify\", produce and warehouse just to save a dollar or something per unit does not sound like any sane business decision.Some people say that Boeing is that terrible because they cut corners to save costs everywhere.

Just make sure that only for example the NTSB is authorized to download the full recording. If you as a pilot have just barely survived a near fatal event, you probably won&#x27;t mind an NTSB investigator listening to the dick jokes you have done as a pilot inflight. And if it was a fatal crash the dead pilot won&#x27;t mind at all. reply contravariant 9 hours agorootparentprevNormally I would agree with them that making the recording much longer than it plausibly needs to be is not a good idea. Preventing life-or-death situations is about the only reason I&#x27;m in favour of recording anything at all.However evidently 2 hours of sound isn&#x27;t long enough. Just because a plane keeps going for more a few hours doesn&#x27;t mean the incident wasn&#x27;t serious enough to warrant recording. reply mulmen 9 hours agorootparentSure, more time would be good for investigators. But pilots have legitimate concerns about these recordings. Those concerns need to be heard and addressed so this change can be made safely. reply crazytony 12 hours agorootparentprevyes.

If they switch to Airbus they’re going to be waiting until at least 2030. They could buy used but that’s goes against why airlines are ordering new planes to begin with.

Thats why you’ll see airlines be a Boeing or Airbus only fleet. reply Fischgericht 6 hours agorootparentI have seen this 2030 number posted a couple of times now. Is this validated information? Is it really such a long wait to get an airplane from Airbus? reply hef19898 36 minutes agorootparentYes, their order book for the A320Neo is that full. As is Boeings for the 737 if I remember correctly. One can always pay more and hope someone else is cancelling so, this approach ain&#x27;t working at scale so.

The 320 and 220 are faced with major engine issues and groundings due to looks at notes not QAing the metal powder used in the sintering process for over 8 years. reply mulmen 9 hours agorootparentExcept Alaska is an all Boeing 737 airline and they are still operating. Only some of the planes are grounded. reply panick21_ 8 hours agorootparentprevThere have been basically no engine development program ever that had no reliability issues. The big problem is the maintenance backlog. The A320 NEO btw has more then 1 engine option. reply Fischgericht 4 hours agoparentprevI also find it troubling that according to various press reports today the initial inspection instructions Boeing has given to the airlines have pretty much boiled down to \"look around if you find loose bolts somewhere\". If they had a working documented QA process they should have been able to immediately release step by step instructions on what exactly needs to checked and where.My company builds routers, which are far less mission critical. We have step by step instructions on QA steps both hanging on our walls and available digitally, too. It would take us an hour or so to share these with customers.I also wonder: All the time I only read about Alaska Airlines and United having grounded their 737 max planes. What about all the other customers of them around the world? I haven&#x27;t heard of any other airline, for example here in Europe where I am, having grounded those planes for inspection.

Not like you have a ton of options. reply Fischgericht 5 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a comparable situation.A lot of Tesla drivers, especially the early ones, are part of some kind of cult. Think about all the people who paid thousands of USD&#x2F;Euro to buy a license to \"Autopilot is coming in two weeks\", to still haven&#x27;t gotten any return on investment at all (over here in Europe it is not available at all).And I am saying this having bought my Tesla three years ago.Also, while their build quality is pretty terrible compared to oldschool car manufacturers, with the exception of Autopilot most of their build quality problems are not safety related. Think of the excellent Euro NCAP Safety test results, for example. It&#x27;s more like that you know that if you buy a Tesla you can not expect the wipers to be any good at cleaning the window, or the doors not being aligned properly.My impression is that Tesla has a very good QA, but with a policy of \"we&#x27;ll ignore all cosmetics\".Boeing on the other hand does appear to have completely broken QA processes in the safety sector. Their priorities might be the opposite of Tesla&#x27;s.

But from a broader societal view we&#x27;d all be better off if we did it and it is pro-social and pro-civic to be willing to sacrifice a little of your personal convenience to make a point like this. Nothing but nothing will get Boeing&#x27;s attention like what is essentially an end-customer strike.In general quite a lot of the chains wrapped around us that drive so many people to complain are really only kept there by raw personal selfish convenience. To be clear, I am absolutely not saying that they are not real as a result. They are perfectly real. But in many cases they are still really nothing more than personal convenience holding you. For instance, as I write this, almost all of the dangers of smart phones can be kept at bay just by refusing the conveniences. (Not quite all.

Relating this back to the thread, the risk of catastrophic failure from your choice (or non-choice) of airframe only really affects the off-ground danger and not the higher danger you face on a taxiway&#x2F;runway.- All of these numbers are based purely on fatalities but I’m guessing your definition of “safety” includes being maimed or otherwise seriously injured.

This also allows SWA to fly with one less flight attendant than they would on the larger plane.If there is a maintenance issue with your 737-Max8, and there is a 737-800 sitting in the next gate not set to go out until a few hours after your plane, they&#x27;ll swap it out to reduce the chance of having a late departure.If the site is not scraping data every minute, there could be mismatches.

An airline really isn&#x27;t in a position to verify every design detail of an aircraft any more than you&#x27;re responsible for verifying there are no potential design flaws in your (much simpler) car that could potentially cause someone injury. reply jessriedel 14 hours agorootparentI think airlines are a lot more responsible for verifying design flaws in their airplane than I am in my car. First, they are a giant business which has way more resources to do this. Second, they are selling a service.If I was running a US taxi service and bought a fleet of flawed Indian cars that caused crashes, I think I would be partially responsible. reply mkipper 13 hours agorootparentThis analogy isn&#x27;t very convincing to me.Car manufacturing is a regulated industry. When I buy a car in the USA, even for my taxi business, I shouldn&#x27;t need to hire a team of engineers to verify that it was properly designed and won&#x27;t spontaneously combust. I should be able to assume that if the car is being legally sold to the public in the USA, the manufacturer has demonstrated that it meets some basic safety requirements set out by the government. I obviously have some _operational_ responsibilities (e.g. taking my taxis out of service if they&#x27;re recalled for a design flaw), but I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself responsible at all if my taxi happened to be the first 2025 Toyota Camry that spontaneously combusted from some design flaw.Regulators aren&#x27;t perfect but this is one reason they exist. The FAA has a set of requirements for manufacturing and selling planes in the USA and they have a set of requirements for operating an airline. If I&#x27;m operating an airline and the FAA tells me that the verification of an airplane&#x27;s design and its assembly is the manufacturer&#x27;s responsibility and not mine, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to hold me responsible if my brand new airplane falls from the sky because of a design flaw. reply kube-system 13 hours agorootparent> I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself responsible at all if my taxi happened to be the first 2025 Toyota Camry that spontaneously combusted from some design flaw.Not that it is relevant to the overall relevance to the aviation argument here, but just in regards to cars in the US -- you often would be held liable for that, depending on which specific liability we are talking about, what the damages are, and in which jurisdiction you are operating in. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re responsible for using street legal cars, yes. But I don&#x27;t see any taxi company being responsible if they used GM cars that turned out to have a defective ignition switch back in the day for example.I assume airlines do some degree of due diligence and, I believe they choose the engine type if there are options available but you probably overestimate the ability of a business whose primary job is to ferry passengers from point A to point B to do a serious design verification of every tiny detail of an aircraft.

Driving, buses, trains, trams, bicycling, scootering, ziplining, whatever. They&#x27;re all less safe. reply bitcharmer 13 hours agorootparentCan&#x27;t say if you missed this on purpose or by omission but there&#x27;s a few more after 1994.From your own source:The aircraft experienced a contained engine failure with debris penetrating the fuselage; one passenger was partially ejected from the aircraft and later died of her injuries.This is horrific. Boeing, of course and happened in 2018 reply stouset 13 hours agorootparentI literally addressed this:> We did also see one fatality aboard a 737-700 in 2018, but this was due to an issue with the CFM engine and which isn&#x27;t attributable to Boeing.There is essentially no aviation industry expert who will place this failure at the feet of Boeing and not CFM. That said, the fact that engines are designed to completely contain debris from a failure is wild and speaks to the incredible standard of safety we hold aviation to. replygruez 15 hours agorootparentprev> But, we&#x27;re seeing fatal issues with one specific company over and over again. Knowing that there is some systemic failure within Boeing must change your priors, no?\"systemic failure within Boeing\" isn&#x27;t necessarily inconsistent with \"air traffic safety continues to improve\". For instance, better pilot training and safety regulations might make flying even safer despite Boeing creating more crashes. reply legitster 15 hours agorootparentprevI have concerns, but not enough not to fly.Everything I do in life is a calculated risk. If you told me my toaster was 3 times as likely to kill me today I would still probably toast my bread knowing that the base rate was already pretty low.If anything, knowing that all of the headline grabbing incidents has been confined to one product line at one company, and watching the amount of scrutiny they are receiving for it makes me feel safer overall. replyJumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparentprev> safety is getting worseRecord passenger miles flown [1] with years of zero fatalities since, I believe, 2020 [2][3] refutes this hypothesis.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;RPM[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airlines.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;safety-record-of-u-s-air-ca...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airlines.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;safety-record-of-u-s-air-ca... reply jmward01 15 hours agorootparentprevThat is a big statement. Since 2019 there have been 32 fatalities connected to commercial aircraft. Most of those were iv very small aircraft like seaplanes and helicopters. 32 deaths in 4 years compared to ~40k&#x2F;year in cars. We need to keep things in perspective. reply ibejoeb 15 hours agorootparentEthiopian Airlines Flight 302, a MAX, crashed in 2019, killing 157 people. reply jmward01 15 hours agorootparentI forgot to say &#x27;in the united states&#x27;. Thanks for the correction. The car statistics would go up massively if they were worldwide and getting those is harder (and less accurate) than in the US alone. Additionally, the regulatory framework for aviation isn&#x27;t the same everywhere so it is a bit apples to oranges to compare outside the US although it is clear that the issues leading to the two MAX crashes were design and training in nature and directly point back at Boeing as a root cause. reply daedalus_j 15 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a big difference between an unsafe airframe and pilot error&#x2F;poor-training though.For example the recent crash in Japan. Airbus isn&#x27;t getting railed for that one.I know several 737 pilots on US flag carriers. Even at the time they were saying that neither crash would be possible for their fleet as they had done simulator training of exactly those sorts of scenarios.From wikipedia: While defending the pilots&#x27; actions, Sullenberger was also highly critical of allowing someone with only 200 hours of flight experience to be first officer.I hate sounding like a Boeing apologist, but I do think it&#x27;s worth being very clear about where blame lies for things so that we can both asses risk accurately and make appropriate corrections. reply ibejoeb 15 hours agorootparentThe was no pilot error or equipment malfunction in that incident. (I suppose you could look at the pilot of the dash 8 and wonder why he didn&#x27;t hold short, but he could have been driving a golf cart and still made an runway incursion.) It didn&#x27;t even happen in the air.Boeing was rightly blamed for misleading everyone about the nature of the MAX8. It is a materially different airframe, and it required different systems to be created to be competently flyable with 737 type rating. Is Boeing misleading anyone here on the MAX9? Personally, I doubt it. It was probably a fluke non-conforming part, since that plug is a carryover from other 737s. The track record leaves a lot of us wondering if something&#x27;s up, though. reply daedalus_j 12 hours agorootparent> Boeing was rightly blamed for misleading everyone about the nature of the MAX8Pilots I am personally friends with who fly for American, Southwest, and United, disagree. They feel they were fully prepped for the differences in the airframe from their first flight on it, pre-crashes, and have said that they blame the carriers that crashed for not prepping their pilots the same.It&#x27;s entirely possible that I missed some news, but I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the FAA or anyone else actually accusing Boeing of intentionally misleading or releasing incorrect information?My analogy to to Japan, while poor, was just meant to illustrate that we should be very clear about the true causes of things. \"Boeing lied\" is a very different problem than \"Boeing squeezed a new system in, advised that pilots should be trained, and airlines didn&#x27;t perform enough training\".But yes, I agree that we should be wondering what&#x27;s up, specifically with Boeing&#x27;s assembly&#x2F;QA processes... reply bitcharmer 14 hours agorootparentprev> For example the recent crash in Japan. Airbus isn&#x27;t getting railed for that.What a bizarre comment to make. Why on earth would Airbus get railed for what happened in Japan? reply daedalus_j 13 hours agorootparentMy point is that Boeing will take the flak for what is arguably a pilot error situation with the MAX crashes.We should be very careful to distinguish between actual airframe issues and issues that are related to politics and poor decision making or training.There&#x27;s nothing we know of that is fundamentally unsound about the 737 MAX airframe, there are mistakes that have been made in very small subset of the airframes&#x2F;flights operating, and yet everyone is running around like you&#x27;re taking your life into your hands every time one flies over your head. reply bitcharmer 4 hours agorootparent> My point is that Boeing will take the flak for what is arguably a pilot error situation with the MAX crashesIt&#x27;s hard to say if you&#x27;re trolling or just very misinformed. Boeing was hiding the fact that MAX had additional system to correct the pitch from the pilots. replyomikun 15 hours agorootparentprevTo keep things in perspective we should compare fatalities per person trips or person miles. Total deaths doesn&#x27;t mean as much when a lot more people travel by car. reply stouset 15 hours agorootparentWe do, and there has been one death due to an incident on a major U.S. airline since November 2001.You can maybe argue two, where a woman was killed after exiting an Asiana plane after it crashed at SFO. She was hit by an emergency vehicle responding to the scene. reply sokoloff 14 hours agorootparentAsiana is not in the set of \"major US airlines\".Separately, major US airlines can reliably fly a daytime visual approach with a fully working airplane into a major airport. reply hardcopy 15 hours agorootparentpreveh. To a certain extent you should compare based on distance traveled, maybe. But total miles driven in the USA are quite high compared to other countries. Lots of driving simply doesn&#x27;t need to happen, but occurs because we induce it by the way we design the places where we build.I don&#x27;t really care how safe driving is per mile, I care if I&#x27;m going to be dead at the end of the year. reply chrisbolt 11 hours agorootparentprevThough I agree flying is extremely safe, keep in mind that of those 4 years, two of them were while the 737 MAX was grounded, and much of it was while air travel was much lower due to COVID. reply radiator 15 hours agorootparentprevPeople spend so much more time inside cars than inside airplanes every year, that such a comparison seems disingenuous. You should normalize the deaths by time travelled. reply stouset 14 hours agorootparentLiterally any way you slice it, flying a major airline in the U.S. is safer than any other form of transportation, including walking. reply michaelsshaw 15 hours agorootparentprevIf any other mode of transportation were nearly as dangerous as roadways in the US, it would be made illegal. The fact is that the 737 MAX has, by its own flaws, killed hundreds of people in recent memory. People don&#x27;t want to deal with this clearly cursed line of airplanes at all. reply bigfishrunning 15 hours agorootparentprevI also think comparing air travel to car travel is a bit unfair -- it&#x27;s better to compare air travel to Bus travel (the driver has a CDL) or Train travel (The engineer is specially trained)Car fatalities likely dwarf bus and train fatalities too. It&#x27;s not that airplanes are particularly safe, it&#x27;s that cars are particularly unsafe. reply DennisP 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s true, but the question might be whether you personally should be worried if you find yourself on a 737 Max. reply alrs 16 hours agorootparentThe first worry as an American is having a pillar of your country&#x27;s economy managed by incompetents. reply gruez 16 hours agorootparentSounds a lot like \"yeah sure, fear over 737 Max is overblown, but the fact that I was thinking about it in the first place says something about the current state of affairs\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smbc-comics.com&#x2F;comic&#x2F;aaaah reply alrs 15 hours agorootparentIt sounds nothing like that. Boeing is going to lose deals because carriers don&#x27;t want to deal with repeated groundings. The US economy will reflect that. reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agorootparentprevPeople are concerned because it seems irrefutable that there is corruption and a culture of cost cutting causing these issues.Incompetence is understandable, improperly modeling the physics due to lack of experience or knowledge is understandable, but repeated instances that point to corruption at the government regulator and bad culture at the manufacturer lend to fears that the situation will get worse for a while before it gets better.It’s the same reason you might avoid flying on an Eastern European&#x2F;Russian airplane. The perceived risks move from unforeseeable error or bad luck to systemic error. reply flashback2199 16 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t matter. Nothing will change unless enough people begin voting with their feet. reply dkarl 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not true, and we&#x27;d get to a much, much worse place if we relied on that. The industry put the current system in place because it could see that airlines would make gruesome compromises if consumer choice was the only thing driving safety. reply flashback2199 15 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean \"if\", anyone can choose what plane to fly on anytime. reply jen20 16 hours agorootparentprevMany airlines allow same day changes. If everyone scheduled on a Max reschedules for alternative flights consistently, they&#x27;ll get the message soon enough. Refusing to board a Boeing plane at all is perfectly reasonable at this stage. reply psunavy03 16 hours agorootparentprev[citation needed] reply yreg 16 hours agorootparentprevOkay, but I&#x27;m not sure fearmongering is the way to go.

Specially if you don&#x27;t surround yourself we a new high tech 2-tons of steel.Being fucking murder by a car when walking is way more dangerous. reply duxup 16 hours agorootparentprev> Air safety going downIs it? reply stouset 16 hours agorootparentprev> safety is getting worse, not better or even staying the sameThe only death in US major commercial aviation in ages was when a woman was partially sucked out of a window in 2018 when an engine failed and blew apart, breaking the window open.Before that, we have the Asiana flight which crashed after landing short at SFO, striking the undercarriage on the edge of the floating platform and cartwheeling. Everyone survived the crash, but a woman was killed when a fire truck ran over her amidst the firefighting foam.Prior to that we have to go to 2005 when a plane overran a runway and hit a car, killing one occupant… of the car.We have to go all the way back to November 2001 to have a serious accident where an American plane crashed on takeoff, killing all on board. Technically this was due to pilot error due to over-responding to wake turbulence, breaking off the vertical stabilizer. But it’s arguably an engineering issue that the pilot was able to induce catastrophic structural failure through control inputs.There has definitely been a worrying trend lately in operational error with pilots and ATC nearly causing accidents due to runway incursions, nearly landing on taxiways, etc. But it’s really hard to say with a straight face that major airlines have anything other than an exemplary safety record the likes of which has been completely unparalleled before now. We have had one single death aboard a major commercial aviator in the U.S. in more than twenty two years. reply flashback2199 15 hours agorootparentThe only reason nobody was injured this time was nobody was sitting in the seats next to the door plug that blew off. The seat was destroyed. reply stouset 15 hours agorootparentI don’t think we can even remotely say that.From all photo evidence I’ve seen, some cushions were sucked off the seat. These cushions are designed to be removed. If a passenger was seated and wearing their seat belt, I have every faith that they would have been fine. Uncomfortable as hell but ultimately fine. I’ll bet money the NTSB report will say as much.And the point stands that the only reason this story is noteworthy is because of airlines’ spotless safety record over the past two decades. Incidents like this are exceedingly rare. reply flashback2199 15 hours agorootparentIt is trivial to see how someone sitting there not seat belted could have perished. You do understand that long stretches of flight allow you to be unseatbelted right? reply stouset 15 hours agorootparentThey allow you to, but on every single flight I’ve been on in ages, the pilot makes a note that they recommend keeping your seatbelt fastened whenever you’re seated. People have been injured due to sudden and unforeseen turbulence, and it’s just a good idea in general.That said this incident occurred during the initial climb-out where seat belt use is mandatory.So yes, if a passenger was seated there and if their belt was unbuckled, I can see how somebody would have died. Nobody is saying that this isn’t a serious fuckup that doesn’t need to be investigated and remedied.What I am saying is that major airlines in the U.S. have a more or less unblemished safety record for twenty two years, the likes of which has not only been unparalleled in aviation, but by any other form of transport. Literally walking is more dangerous than flying a major commercial airline in the U.S.The MAX line of planes in particular has had their share of problems, but with the MCAS situation resolved there is no reason to believe that it in particular is any less safe than any other airframe operated by the majors. The issue with the door plug is unlikely to be related to the MAX (the same part and design have been in service without issue since well before the MAX). It will be investigated, fixed, and we will in all likelihood go back to flying gajillions of passenger miles without serious incident.I’ll put this another way: if all of this gnashing of teeth and doom and gloom causes enough anxiety over flying that a few hundred people choose",

They don&#x27;t have UI tests for Opera on the Nintendo Wii either, and at this point I bet the install base for Wii-Opera is still larger than the install base for FF mobile.TBH, when I was there it surprised me that Google didn&#x27;t have a dedicated hardware test-bench room with rows upon rows of browser deployments that every UI change needed to be burn-in tested on, but... They don&#x27;t. They never did. In general, their strategy is to be nimble and deploy rapidly (with the expectation they can roll back rapidly). In that context, it actually makes sense why they don&#x27;t have that warehouse of test-bench installations... They&#x27;d slow-down rollbacks as well as rollouts.A handful of projects have dedicated testing targets. They&#x27;re driven mostly by the ideology of individual Googlers (some people really like Firefox) and a handful of high-value users that have specific installs Google isn&#x27;t interested in pissing off.

Not really a knock on the people doing the work — doing stuff in high stress sucks. But it&#x27;s clear that they&#x27;re intentionally deprioritizing a competitor. reply KirinDave 16 hours agorootparentFor one, that \"deprioritize a competitor\" is not clear at all. Why would that be so? Isn&#x27;t it far more likely, given the rarity of these events, that a test regression occurred or some other subtle issue rather than assumed malfeasance?For two, that \"next update in 12 hours\" is user comms. For me, at least, google.com works fine both on curl and my browser. That&#x27;s a fairly normal cadence for big companies.On the larger point about \"nimble and deploying rapidly\", the people who generally brag about \"being nimble and deploying rapidly\" almost never serve an even 1&#x2F;100th the audience the size of Google.com does, and it&#x27;s really questionable if, at that scale, you actually want to risk global regressions even on trivial bugs.So I don&#x27;t know what that user is talking about, and I agree with you that they are obviously not that.That approach may be antithetical to the modern startup engineer frantic to prove their stock&#x27;s hypothetical worth to their investors, unconcerned about trivial revenue loss from frontpage issues because of whatever latest node.js drama nuked their continuously deployed website. But the fact that \"the landing search page is broken for 1% of users in a rare but public use case\" is news at all is because Google&#x27;s approach for search sets our expectations that this won&#x27;t happen. reply chias 15 hours agorootparentI think the parent comment&#x27;s point is: if this were affecting a version of Google-branded Chrome with similar market share, do you think we would still be getting \"next update in 12 hours\"?I remember an internal mantra in Google along the lines of \"if you break something in production, roll back first, ask questions about how it happened later, even if you think it&#x27;s a simple fix\".

If they were to send an older user agent string, the issue would likely be resolved. However, any rollback would need to be implemented by Firefox, and it seems they are not at fault here.From Google&#x27;s standpoint, this issue may be considered a \"new\" bug, which means they need to conduct an investigation and address it.

I think it’s more along the lines of Google only focusing QA on Chrome and Safari, figuring that they save money and, probably never written down, any problems just make their browser look better.This keeps happening over and over for Google at a rate far in excess of other major tech companies so we know they don’t make an effort to test with Firefox, and it’s why I’d like regulators to force anyone making a browser used by more than, say, 100k people to be obligated to test in other browsers on every site their larger organization operates and have a maximum time to patch any compatibility or performance issue which isn’t due to a browser not implementing a W3C standard. The goal would be to cover things like YouTube using the Chrome web component API for ages after the standard shipped and serving a slow polyfill to non-Chrome browsers. reply jefftk 14 hours agorootparent> Google only focusing QA on Chrome and SafariFWIW, over my time at Google (2012-2022) we had massively better testing on Firefox than Safari, because you can run Firefox on Linux on arbitrary hardware while Safari requires MacOS which requires Apple hardware and is automation-hostile. We did eventually get some tests on Safari, but they were slower and flakier. reply acdha 14 hours agorootparentSo I guess my question would be where things were breaking down - Meet was almost unusable in Firefox for 2019-2021 (Slack, Teams, Zoom, Chime, and WebEx were all fine), and the GCP console login would periodically get into a login redirect loop only in Firefox on a regular basis for months. Our GCP rep never could get an answer on whether anyone was even aware of that problem. reply jefftk 14 hours agorootparentMy guess is those paths didn&#x27;t have automated tests, or the automated tests missed some important aspect of real-world usage?

If you think one use case for tls1.1 is OK for one use case, just accept you support it.Same for every thing else. Every time you use UA sniff, you are doing it wrong. not matter how smart you think you are. You are not. It&#x27;s just a momentary feel good because you are oblivious to everything else.

There&#x27;s (or at least was) still an internal group of Firefox users a few years ago, but it&#x27;s small, and internal tools may have poor or no support for Firefox at any given time. When I worked there I made some attempts to fix things (e.g. once Google Cloud was accidentally broken on Firefox during a time when many people were out...) but the bigger problem is that most people don&#x27;t use Firefox because it&#x27;s inconvenient or they don&#x27;t care to and a lot of the tooling only works on Chrome&#x2F;only works well on Chrome.There&#x27;s a silver lining though: it really doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s due to negligence or malicious sabotage, and if they (where \"they\" is hypothetical leadership within Google that is trying to eliminate Firefox) thought that pleading negligence instead of sabotage was going to be a good defense, we&#x27;ll see how that holds up to future scrutiny and regulation.

Keep it here, usually the associated experts are already on their way or busy working on the problem and you are not helping. reply ravenstine 19 hours agoprevThe user agent header has always been a mistake. I&#x27;m not sure what companies like Google are thinking when they block features from working based on the user agent. In Firefox, I use an add-on that randomizes the user agent string, and I&#x27;ve configured it to use a handful of the most common user agent strings. Occasionally, parts of YouTube will break because of a certain user agent configured, like chats or chat replay, showing nothing but a broken frame with no meaningful information to a non-developer. I guess one could say that it encourages people to update their browsers, or use Chrome which auto-updates, but come on. If a feature legitimately doesn&#x27;t work, then the user still has to update to a modern browser anyway. reply kevincox 16 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think this is true. Having the user agent is incredibly useful when debugging an issue. It can even be useful for deploying workarounds.For example if you see that errors are being thrown on your site and nearly all of them are the new release of Chrome then you can quickly narrow down it being a compatibility issue with the new version. Similarly if someone is making broken requests to your site at a high rate it may help you figure out who it is and contact them.It can even be useful in automated use cases. If Firefox 27 has a bug it is reasonable to add very specific checks to work around it gracefully. When possible feature detection is better, but some bugs can be very hard to test for.The problem comes from:1. People whitelisting user agents.2. Adding wide sweeping checks, especially if you don&#x27;t constantly re-evaluate them (For example Brave versions later than 32)In this case it seems that it is hard to actually conclude that a user-agent check was bad here. Google could have been trying to serve something that would work better on Firefox (maybe it worked around a bug). Of course that code crashed and burned, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the check was a bad idea.I agree that user-agents are often used for evil, but they can also be used for good. It is hard to justify completely removing them. With great power comes great responsibility.

It&#x27;s a bit of an exaggeration, but to me it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that DDG is way more normie-safe than when I began using it several years ago. DDG shows me more of what I consider detritus than Kagi does. It&#x27;s extremely bad at finding any results by exact text, but to be fair, every search engine is bad at this now. And finally, DDG hasn&#x27;t had what I would consider to be worthwhile feature improvements in a very long time.

They&#x27;ve decided to go PG-rated everywhere even if you have safe search turned off. This is a problem because, even if they just want to block porn or illegal things, this can have an impact on legitimate academic research. And yeah, SEO trash floats to the surface, though they aren&#x27;t entirely in control of this.Kagi (which relies on Brave Search instead of Bing) has less flotsam to start with, provides lots of great tools to filter out the garbage, and is subscriber-driven instead of advertiser or investor driven.DDG had potential, but they decided to give into moral panic and coast on their modest success instead of making substantial improvements. They also decided to pull a Mozilla and spend unnecessary effort working on a browser when they should be focusing on their core product.

The point of that effort is exactly because we value reports of site breakage so highly, and want to ensure that people reporting them have a good experience.Unfortunately when a bug report (not just this in this repo, but almost anywhere) hits (almost any) social media there&#x27;s a high chance of the suddenly large audience making comments that aren&#x27;t at all actionable in fixing the issue. In this case it seems highly unlikely that anyone can add additional information that will allow a faster resolution, whereas there was already one off-topic&#x2F;unactionable comment at the time the issue was locked.So if we leave the issue open, it has the downside of disrupting our normal workflows, and taking attention away from fixing either the problem at hand, or any other issues that currently require our attention. To me that significantly outweighs the potential upside of leaving it open to \"make people feel welcome\".Of course, like many things in life, it&#x27;s not a mathematical problem where you can derive a correct answer, but a set of tradeoffs based on experience, and therefore reasonable people may come to different conclusions. reply Uptrenda 16 hours agorootparentNah, that&#x27;s bullshit.

In the last level he wrote a program (in the pseudo-Assembly language that the game taught him how to create) to have the computer (that he built in the game starting from the logical gates) walk through a randomly generated maze (he used the keep-to-the-right logic). This game ROCKS. My only complaint is that nothing even remotely similar was available when I was his age :(I keep getting stuck on the level where memory is introduced, my brain doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp the concept of \"next&#x2F;previous tick\" very well but plenty of people post hints and even full solutions online so you always have an option to cheat and enter the solution to go to the next level.The game was basically complete more than a year ago, the author has been working on fully rebuilding it , to improve performance and be able to build more complex CPUs etc. I&#x27;m hoping he doesn&#x27;t break anything when he pushes the update.HIGHLY recommend. reply alabhyajindal 34 minutes agoparentJust bought it after reading your comment.

This goes quite a bit further, though-- the most you&#x27;d do with Rocky&#x27;s Boots is something like 2-3 gates + some timing related magic, where this is explicitly about building computers.I teach digital logic and computer architecture classes to middle school and high school students. I&#x27;m looking forward to try this.

Wish I could independently purchase it, though it only seems available from Steam. reply eterm 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;m a big fan of this genre of game, I have a small but growing steam collection of different ones. ( And some non-steam such as nandgame ).Turing complete is one of the better ones, the simulation seems reliable and the missions, after a fair bit of early access re-jigging are reasonably well structured.However, the UI isn&#x27;t always super smooth, and the lack of hand-holding means it&#x27;s better for someone like me who&#x27;s gone through a similar journey before in other simulators.If you&#x27;re looking for something similar that does a better job at explaining the concepts then I&#x27;d recommend \"Silicon Zeroes\". The game as a whole feels even slightly less polished, but has a cute storyline and in my opinion does a better job at explaining each level and what it&#x27;s trying to introduce, and does a much better job with problem solving issues related to \"The Clock\".If you don&#x27;t actually enjoy the the electronics part so much and just enjoy the psuedo-assembly aspect, then I&#x27;d recommend TIS100 or Shenzhen I&#x2F;O.If you prefer well-crafted puzzles then something like \"Human Resource Machine\" may be more your style.It&#x27;s also worth noting this Turing Complete news post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1444480&#x2F;eventcomments&#x2F;3806156...After no updates for a year, there was a news post in August 2023 to say, \"Sorry, there&#x27;s a big new update coming soon!\".And radio silence since then too.It seems the developer has got stuck with such a monumental \"big rewrite\" that it&#x27;s ended up taking vastly longer than anticipated.I&#x27;ve been waiting for it to leave early access before going back into it, but I fear I might be waiting forever. reply koromak 10 hours agoparentMight as well ask you. I’m toying with the idea of a zachronics style game about analog computing. Building the circuit sim currently. But I can’t tell if it would actually be fun, or if i can find a way to make it fun.Digital computing has the benefit of abstraction. You don’t need to know Ohms law to think about logic gates. If I commit to analog computing, then I absolutely have to find a way to teach the math. The operations are no longer Boolean, they’re a combination of a bunch of different electrical equations. Even if it’s simple math, it doesn’t have the same ethos a programming game typically has.Does this even sound interesting? Would you play it? reply FumblingBear 8 hours agorootparentNot the OP, but that sounds like a blast to me! I&#x27;d definitely play it!Another game that did a similar thing (that I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of) is Spintronics [0].It goes a whole step further from just creating analog circuits digitally and lets you build them both online and in board game form. I backed it on kickstarter and was amazed at how well the game turned out. Haven&#x27;t finished it yet due to life getting in the way, but if you&#x27;re looking for inspiration, their circuit simulator is available online for free.As a fan of Zach-likes, I&#x27;d definitely be interested and play what you&#x27;re cooking up :)[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upperstory.com&#x2F;spintronics&#x2F; reply koromak 8 hours agorootparentYeah Spintronics was absolutely a bit of a inspiration after the Steve Mould video he did. In fact I&#x27;m still racking my brain for some kind of physical analogy rather than circuits, since you can reason about them better. AlphaPheonix talks a lot about how water + gravity is a really good intuitive analogy for voltage, with pipe circumference you could get something like current, but that would be a totally different (and also 3D) game.I find the physical Zachtonic games to be the most compelling, Opus Magnum especially, because you&#x27;re essentially learning a brand new way to compute using space and time as your algebra rather than logic gates. I&#x27;d love to find something more akin to that. reply octobus2021 5 hours agorootparentI think water flowing through pipes would be perfect analogy for electricity. I believe the author addressed it somewhere and said he couldn&#x27;t make it work so had to stick to gears and springs. It turned out to be fine but I preferred Turing Tumble honestly (digital rather than analog). But both are very good, can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re indie products. reply shizzy0 9 hours agoparentprevMHRD is also great in this genre. I’ve played it multiple times. I’m happy to hear there are more like it. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;576030&#x2F;MHRD&#x2F; reply adv_zxy 6 hours agoparentprevAs a zachtronics&#x27; fan I also recommend \"Opus Magnum\" and \"Exapunks\". In Exapunks you need to learn a new assembly-like language and use it to command your robot agent. I had a ton of fun in it.I remember I only played the first few challenges of Human Resource Machine. The puzzles felt a little too easy, and solving them wasn&#x27;t very challenging, so I never went on to the later parts. reply maltalex 18 hours agoprevFunny, I just bought it during the Steam winter sale. It&#x27;s a cool concept, but it definitely needs a lot more polish to be a genuine game or even a standalone teaching tool.It just throws these problems at you with little guidance, teaching, or preparation. It&#x27;s fine for someone with relevant knowledge. But, to a beginner I feel like it would be a mostly frustrating experience.Also, it could benefit from providing some help with laying out the circuits. Moving or rotating components disconnects them from their tracks which you have to draw manually one at a time. So, once you figured out the right logic, there&#x27;s a decent amount of friction to implement it. reply zamadatix 14 hours agoparentOne of the first few levels has a tip about double clicking a component to move the component and its connected wires at the same time (double clicking automatically selects the attached wire nodes as well as the component). It could use a bit more polish in the UI department though. reply maltalex 10 hours agorootparentThanks, I must have missed it. reply freedomben 13 hours agoparentprevHow much was it?

It&#x27;s one that&#x27;s best in large doses. And, like Factorio, if you return after a long while it&#x27;s often more fun to restart than continue (or just stay in the endgame sandbox). UI could use a bit of polish and there has been a great deal of performance rework going on for the last couple of years not yet released. Verilog export is there nowadays but I haven&#x27;t really tried it. The additional components you unlock towards the end really make the sandbox fun. It also has a scoring mechanism which adds a layer of competitiveness to the game but you don&#x27;t unlock it until well into the game (well past the first computer).I played this extensively before deciding to go for a comp sci degree mid career (seemed like a fun thing to do, so far it has been!) and it made the base architecture stuff a breeze. I could highly recommend it for anyone looking for a fun refresher as well. \"Fun\" being a loose term - the fun is messing with boolean logic in a friendly environment, if you don&#x27;t like that idea then you won&#x27;t like this \"game\". reply cybrox 20 hours agoprevWe have actually been using this at work and I can highly recommend it!I have played through it together with my colleague in my free time about a year ago and we really liked it. We figured it would be the perfect fit for our electrical engineering apprentices, since they do learn all concepts of digital logic such as gates, registers, shift registers, counters, etc. during their educational journey but they rarely ever put a lot of it into a practical project. Also, a lot of derived things such as assembly programming are simply not taught anymore in the interest of time.With some additional outside guidance, this game can really help people understand the working of digital logic components and motivate them to play around with them. The fact that you can go all the way to writing a simple assembly language and solving some puzzles with it is awesome and really motivated them. reply jermaustin1 17 hours agoprevWhen I first opened the page, I thought this was just a knockoff of the \"Digital Logic Sim\" by Sebastian Lague [1], but watching the video, I was impressed by how much deeper this actually went.

TC was fun because you make up your own ISA while building a complete miniature CPU, and you can take it as far as you want. reply rodlette 7 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a time and space for games, but I&#x27;ll just note that for HN readers, following https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com.au&#x2F;Digital-Design-Computer-Architectu... and building a RISC-V in Verilog is easily manageable. reply simonebrunozzi 7 hours agoprevIt seems a fantastic game.I wish they did something like that for the old \"Core War\" [0].

It is mostly structured like a course you would take and the game it leads up to is a means to an end.Turing complete on the other hand is a more playful approach that guides you through the individual steps (though it still requires you to look up quite a lot of things on your own) with a little story and provides more smaller challenges instead of just one big end goal. In addition to that, it features a relatively powerful sandbox that allows you to interact with things and there&#x27;s a scoring system for complexity and runtime for all your little solutions that gives it a small competitive side.I wouldn&#x27;t say one is better than the other. NAND-to-Tetris is a learning resource with a game in it and Turing Complete is a game with learning resources and a sandbox in it. reply ykonstant 11 hours agorootparentI am a little confused; is NAND-to-tetris free?

It&#x27;s really good, a very accessible introduction to how computers work.There were a couple of kinks in the UI that need to be ironed out like zooming and scrolling, but conceptually, the drag-and-drop UI for building circuits is excellent.I didn&#x27;t get that far before life got in the way and I put it down - I think I was stuck on the adding bytes section.

Which did you like better? reply zamadatix 15 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve played and enjoyed both. I&#x27;ll say I liked Turing Complete a lot more but it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.Shenzhen I&#x2F;O is more a puzzle game where you get thrown a bunch of miniature puzzles you solve via programming cleverness to advance some overall story theme while enjoying general puzzle solving.Turing Complete is more a digital circuit sandbox which starts you off in a direction of building up more and more complicated components and abstractions and you get more and more freedom as you go until you&#x27;ve unlocked everything and it becomes a big sandbox for you. There is technically a loose \"story\" but it&#x27;s more or less just something to give context around what you&#x27;re currently trying to build in the level not an actual plot. I.e. you could read every line of \"story\" ahead of time and it would not detract from your first playthrough as it&#x27;s not really a narrative.I will say Turing Complete starts off with a very limited feel though. The farther you make it into the game the less and less you see guardrails. reply michael_michael 15 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;re both worth getting. I haven&#x27;t finished either game, so I can&#x27;t talk about end-game value for either, but it certainly feels to me like Turing Complete is an educational game with puzzle components, while Shenzhen I&#x2F;O is a straight puzzle game.Both are a lot of fun, and very well-made.Shenzhen I&#x2F;O (like most Zachtronics games) has some nice worldbuilding touches like the printable datasheets for the made-up electrical components, and a barely-there programming language manual. reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 16 hours agoprevHow do we formalize the concept of \"turing complete, if it were just infinite.\" Like, it&#x27;s not turing complete, but we can intuitively treat it as if it was.

If you&#x27;re doing this for a living you probably don&#x27;t want to do that as part of a game too, and if you aren&#x27;t, you probably will find it too dry and detailed because it is THAT close to a real job...I haven&#x27;t gotten TIS-100 however many years it came out for the same reason.

    "originLink": "https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project",
    "originBody": "Atuin supercharges your productivity by enabling you to rapidly retrieve any command you’ve ran, at any time, from anywhere. It stores your shell history in a database, recording additional command context and syncing it (e2e encrypted) across devices. The 22nd of December was my last day leading the infrastructure team at PostHog. Going forwards, I’m starting a company and working full time on Atuin. Info Atuin will continue to be open source and available for free in its current form as a self-hosted tool. By going full-time I hope I can focus on adding new premium hosted features for advanced users, and begin to support business usage. How did I get here? § I started Atuin a few years ago now, to scratch an itch I had. I always felt that the shell should be easier to use, and that the state of shell history was the #1 problem there. I’d be googling commands that I knew I’d ran several times at some point in the past, or booting up my other laptop just to retrieve an incantation from earlier that week. It turns out, a whole bunch of people felt the same. Some people even contributed - thank you so much to the more-than-150 people who’ve taken the time to make a PR, no matter how large or small. An extra special thank you to those of you who’ve stuck around a bit longer ❤ At the beginning of 2023, I spoke at FOSDEM. I had a tonne of fantastic feedback about the tool, both in person and online. This was great for my motivation - after a couple of years, I was starting to feel tired as an OSS maintainer. I started putting more time and energy into the project, which paid off very well. Our usage grew massively - more contributors, more signups, more active community members, more features in blogs/podcasts/etc. We also moved the GitHub repo from ellie/atuin, to atuinsh/atuin. I also had to make some improvements to the infrastructure, mostly because we store a lot of data (encrypted blobs don’t compress well…). While it is possible to self host Atuin, many people use the hosted sync server. Some metrics: User growth § History growth § We started 2023 with users uploading (in total) around 10,000 lines of history a day. We ended it with users uploading almost 200,000 lines a day. A balancing act § It turns out, the more you put in, the more you get out. While it was great to see growth in the project, it started to get away from me towards the end of the year. I’d work on Atuin before work, but more often than not I wouldn’t even get through the open PRs + issues. Let alone work on new features/fixes that were needed. Earlier in the year, my friend Conrad had also stepped back from helping out maintaining, which was totally understandable. I felt like I was letting the project down, neglecting my social life, and was trying very hard not to be distracted at work. In order to grow the project how I’d like to, I needed to be able to dedicate more time to it than is fair while having a full time job. So, I’m starting a company and working on Atuin full-time. I’ve always wanted to run my own company, for pretty much my entire life. But I didn’t want to start something just for the sake of it. I want to build something people love, and find useful. Money § I’d been paying out of pocket to run the Atuin servers the whole time. While not a huge amount, it also wasn’t tiny - 10s of millions of lines of encrypted shell history add up to a reasonably large amount of storage. Especially when you account for backups and moderate redundancy. Towards the end of 2022, a friend suggested I setup GitHub sponsors. I didn’t think anything would come of it, but it did! After a few months I received enough sponsorship to cover the server bills, and to offset some of what I’d paid so far. I really appreciate all of my sponsors for liking my work enough to contribute financially, when there’s no paywall or requirement whatsoever. One thing I did notice though - I only really gained sponsors when I regularly mentioned that my sponsors account existed. Otherwise, I lost more to attrition than I gained. This sat weirdly with me, as it felt like begging. Speaking privately with some other maintainers, this is not an uncommon experience. I definitely won’t be paying my rent with sponsors any time soon. I read an interview with Mike Perham, the creator of Sidekiq, that sat with me. I encourage you to check it out, but these two quotes stuck in my mind “in the end, OSS burnout will kill any free project which gets traction” I’d certainly felt this. I don’t want the project to die, and I know just how great it can be with proper care and attention. But without change, I’d probably give up to spend more time on other projects or pursuits. The second quote is one that I’d spend a good while thinking about “If you build something valuable, charge money for it” Looking forwards § My hope is that I can build valuable features that people wish to pay for, on top of what we already have. Partly advanced/power users, but especially for business use cases. I’d love to grow Atuin to the point where I can pass it on, and sponsor the people and projects that we depend on. I’m going to wrap up there, but if you have any thoughts please do get in touch! I’d love to hear your thoughts on where Atuin should go next. Sponsors § If you or your company would like to provide support, please check out the Atuin GitHub sponsors! Depending on the tier, I’ll mail out stickers and t-shirts to supporters - there’s also some tiers for companies that wish to show their support publicly, and receive a link back to their site.

I have co-authored a now-archived command line productivity tool with half the number of stars (6-7k, maybe worth more today due to inflation) in the past, and my observation is people are generally very stingy with this type of projects. We did make people&#x27;s lives a little bit better, but unlike frameworks, libraries, etc., it&#x27;s not going to end up in any money-making product, so people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s essential (it&#x27;s not), and companies which tend to donate larger sums than individuals are completely out of scope. I think the total donation (through a PayPal link in README) we got over more than half a decade was less than $100. In comparison, I once made some web-based analytic tools when playing a casual mobile game, and got a few thousand in donations over a year or two -- not much considering the time that went into it, but two orders of magnitude better than the command line productivity tool.However, we hardly ever marketed our project and never tried to \"build a following\" or beg for donations in any way, so maybe the author will do a lot better than us.

Normally you deal with a spill with a mop or towels. There is now too much water and so you decide that your normal towels aren&#x27;t good enough and so you get more & better towels, or even put a sump pump in the corner to keep pumping all this water away.I&#x27;ve written a lot of complicated pipelines and awk and sed etc, but they were either one-offs that are of hardly any value later, or I made a script, and the few things that are neither of those, are so few they automatically don&#x27;t matter because they are few.It&#x27;s not illegal or immoral, just goofy. reply lanza 2 hours agorootparent> You don&#x27;t need any of it. > History is useful enough to exist as a feature, I up-arrow routinely, but it doesn&#x27;t actually matter when it doesn&#x27;t exist.That&#x27;s absurdly naive to think the simplistic constraints of your own workflow is a general rule. reply cuu508 3 hours agorootparentprevHistory can also contain potentially sensitive things like hostnames of non-public systems, usernames, filenames, URLs.

It’s a significant improvement over the bash history configurations (incantations?) I used previously.Where atuin really shines is in keeping a single unified history across multiple shell windows, which my incantations could never get to work correctly on all the platforms I use (zsh&#x2F;bash on OSX&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;msys&#x2F;cygwin&#x2F;babun).I’ve also enjoyed running SQL queries on my atuin-history to learn more about my own workflows to see where I can optimize.Thanks! reply ellieh 2 hours agorootparentthank you for the kind words!> I’ve also enjoyed running SQL queries on my atuin-history to learn more about my own workflows to see where I can optimize.if you could share more about what you found useful there, that would be amazing reply llimllib 7 hours agoparentprevI’m a long-term user, and it’s been a fantastic tool for me.

It’s way too easy to accidentally expose things. For instance, doing a live demo with an audience, and using Ctrl-R out of muscle memory? Suddenly you flashed your password in front of everyone.Generally, I’d recommend using a tool like Unix `pass` or your default OS keyring to store your secrets, then you can run `command1 --password=$(command2)` to feed a password from one command to another. If I really have to type something sensitive, I prefix the whole shell command with a space, which in many shells can be configured to mean that it doesn’t enter history.

I am not about contributing to Linux Systems indeed projects copied by Apple & Windows bussiness.If you do open source work for like Linux, Server or watever which is already avaiable in high cost, then It could be considerable as great hobby.

Build with WikiHouse WikiHouse is a modular building system that makes it easy to design, manufacture and assemble high-performance buildings. Build with blocks Precision manufactured WikiHouse components are digitally fabricated to millimetre precision, so they fit together perfectly to create a straight, accurate building. This makes everything a lot easier later. Lightweight A typical wall block weighs just 39kg, making it easy to handle and install. Strong Interlocked plywood is incredibly strong. A single wall block can support the weight of three elephants. Although we don't recommend you try this, because the elephants don't like it. Durable Spruce plywood has a certified life of 60 years, but if it is kept dry it will last for hundreds of years. Highly insulated The blocks have a U value of 0.14 W/m²K, so your building will be ultra-low energy by default. Carbon negative As well as creating fewer emissions in production than other materials, wood actually captures and stores carbon from the atmosphere while it is in use. Interoperable WikiHouse Skylark blocks are compatible with almost any type of foundations or cladding, and includes zones for ducts, pipes and wires. Easy to assemble A small team can assemble a chassis in hours, without needing traditional construction skills. Circular WikiHouse Skylark buildings can be disassembled instead of demolished, and blocks re–used or recycled at the end of their life.

Why not just make standard sections of 2x4 or 2x6 framing? Start standardizing window sealing details? Literally anything that will actually get some use? Instead we get opensource plywood boxes?Using plywood for all of the structural components means if you get a leak, which all houses get, you are in danger of much more significant damage than lumber framing. And with this system you still need to do all the normal things to build a house (get a designer, route plumbing, electrical, get a civil engineer, install all that stuff, etc.) just instead of framing you have custom blocks you need made.I just don&#x27;t think these make sense. reply ivyirwin 2 hours agoparentThe last time wikihouse showed up on HN (September &#x27;23) I did a deep dive on the process I still haven&#x27;t come out of. 20 years ago as a grad student getting my masters in architecture, I definitely would have had similar comments to most of what&#x27;s on this page. But I don&#x27;t feel that way any more and I&#x27;m actually disappointed by the negativity toward this project – not because it&#x27;s not warranted, but if this were a software project I feel like the criticism would be more constructive rather than so dismissive.WH is not a perfect system, but the approach is commendable for its comprehensive take on building systems. And building systems are broken. For the past two years I&#x27;ve been trying to build my own house (using a contractor), and even as a trained architect the process is ridiculously opaque, costs are exorbitant, and quality control is difficult to manage.I applaud the fact that WH has tried to tackle the entire structure (and for that matter the entire building process – their parent organization has additional projects [0] for design, local building codes, and innovative financing structures). Yes, in the US 2x framing is cheap and relatively inexpensive, but is still complex in its own ways. Floor systems are different from wall systems are different from roof systems. I like that WH has tried to make one unit type (plywood boxes) work for the different systems. Is it the most efficient way? Probably not, but it affords other opportunities.From an ideological perspective I also like that they prioritize sustainability, low energy use, and accessibility of design information to laypeople. On top of that, they&#x27;ve organized their building information like a programmer – they use GitHub to track versions and even have the start of a components database. They are an API short of making this really something the HN community could easily play with.That said they have a long way to go. Framing a house is the easy part. I think if they could standardize the interface for cladding and interior finishes they would be in a better position to disrupt the building industry, but for now contractors will still be a requirement – so there goes your budget and quality.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensystemslab.io&#x2F;projects reply jtriangle 6 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a flawed solution based on a misunderstanding of how houses are actually built&#x2F;designed&#x2F;engineered. Most of what you see being built today is dimensioned based on available timber. It&#x27;s part of why all the houses look the same, because it&#x27;s the most efficient way to build. Everything structural gets built with 2x4&#x27;s or prefab trusses (which are also made of 2x4&#x27;s), windows are all standard sizes, as are cabinets and flooring, and siding, and trim, and if you weren&#x27;t terribly concerned with building homes that were interesting to look at, you could probably optimize all of this further on the design side of things and then prefab things like walls and door frames then lego them together and wind up with something much nicer and likely cheaper than what they&#x27;re doing.The premise isn&#x27;t terribly flawed though, prefab everything into 4x8ft panels, standardize your roof trussing, standardize your layout, and you can probably dig up a little more margin for builders to put directly in their pockets, and have perfectly cookie cutter houses with no regard to the environment they&#x27;re placed in.

I think heavy insulation on interior walls would be great here. reply burlesona 7 hours agoparentprevIt’s a pop-up so I can’t link to it, but their bit about interior walls shows them as thinner. reply hkt 7 hours agoparentprevNot so. If you want high thermal performance in a building, insulation (therefore thickness) is crucial in the entire building envelope. As the beardier building retrofit types say, your house needs a hat (loft insulation) boots (floor insulation) and jacket (wall insulation).Consider this: if you&#x27;re raising the temperature of your floor to say, 25C, that won&#x27;t do much if you&#x27;re doing so on an uninsulated floor where the temperature of the ground beneath is 10C or so. UFH at that temperature is very efficient and thermally comfortable.Consider further that you might then have walls which let all that lovely heat out even if your ceiling and floor are well insulated. It makes sense for them to be just as good, not least because your windows will in all likelihood be the worst part of the room in terms of insulation. Having as uniform a u-value across the room (and building) makes for uniform temperatures throughout. It lends itself to using heat pumps, further raising the efficiency of the building.Further, lifetime emissions of the building are increasingly front loaded in construction as operational emissions drop. Standardising will presumably cut down on costs as well as emissions at that stage.Building physics is an entire subject of its own and is worth studying. I&#x27;d suggest looking at the Association of Environmentally Conscious Builders and their CarbonLite course to learn more. reply hasoleju 48 minutes agoprevI like their cost calculator on the website. I have never seen such a simple interactive method to determine the cost of a house to be built. My experience with building a house is that either you get a very rough estimate by someone which is often wrong or you have to pay an architect or engineer to come up with a more detailed and more accurate cost estimate.Apart from that I noticed that building my current home with their method would cost about 20% more than building it the oldschool way.

Homes from the 1970s and older usually have excellent lumber, more often than not sourced from old-growth timber. My former home from 1949 sat on a 40-foot 12x12 solid cedar beam, for instance.The only other stuff in the walls is either in demand (copper, plumbing metals) or we just throw it out (drywall, insulation).So if these engineered materials are sturdy enough, I would give favorable odds to them being reclaimed. reply ocdtrekkie 3 hours agorootparentA big reason reclaimed lumber is interesting is because it&#x27;s generally plain straight high quality boards and can be used in things with an intentional weathered look.

Wikihouse has been chasing many of the dragons we&#x27;ve been collectively chasing in AEC[0] for... a long time. Seriously I wish I had time to reply to every single comment here because there are a lot of excellent critiques (not just of WH). It shows what kind of communication problem we have in AEC that even the critiques that HAVE good answers within their weelhouse aren&#x27;t adequately addressed by WH.In the US nothing is EVER going to beat light gauge wood framing on cost. That&#x27;s why you see even large (but not tall) complexes build from it.[1] It&#x27;s been reduced to the 0th degree of expense because of the profit motive. That said, this is only when the \"unskilled\" labor of rough framing is cheap. But this doesn&#x27;t necessarily hold for other economies.The early WH work seemed cartoonishly idealistic (they were literal kids so I don&#x27;t really fault them). But that foundation never changed and a lot of what they built on that has seemed like solution in search of a problem. Especially when you consider you don&#x27;t even have to leave the UK to find a better model for self-build[2] and automated modular small scale construction is a really active space right now.Other competitors[3] actually have online configurators that work well to arrange these kinds of elements. But they&#x27;ve realized that&#x27;s where the value is and are holding their systems closer so they can maintain quality and monetize the expertise they brought to bear.And yet other systems have been using industrial scale and logics to great effect for a long, long time.[4]TBH the \"open source\" aspect is really kind of a gimmick. Their designs are useless without the overall system and the system is useless without some way of arranging it all properly. Plus - what are you going to do - buy and learn to run a mill, work your own ply with an extremely slow machine, assemble it in this (ridiculously) finicky way, source and install the insulation properly yourself, and still be confronted with the nontrivial tasks of... everything that&#x27;s not structure and insulation? Not to mention approvals. In the end you&#x27;d need an architect to do all this for you. And... doesn&#x27;t that defeat the point? It&#x27;s very generous that they&#x27;ve assembled all the guides they have but there are cheaper and more flexible construction systems (light gauge wood, block, SIPS, ICF, etc) that are much more mature, non-proprietary (except ICF), much better documented, and much easier to train a helper or two for assistance.I really do appreciate what they&#x27;re -trying- to do.

A large percentage of homes don’t go through this process and become blight.Japanese houses depreciate over a ~30 year cycle where, at the end of that cycle, the only value left is in the land and the home is demolished and rebuilt.If you can use highly recyclable materials, this would encourage more adaptable cities where the housing is more easily adjusted for the needs of the people at the time. Density can go up or down over the course of these long cycles.The other approach is to build simplified floor plans which are highly robust but adaptable to maximize reusability - like the two column, three row warehouse layout which can be be adapted for almost any use case.This is my issue with builders like Icon, who are making 3d printed cement walled homes. Homes that last a long time get adapted many times in their life span, and these structures don’t really enable the growth and adaptation we see from buildings that are useful for many decades. reply jacknews 8 hours agorootparentI agree, and buildings need to be easily reconfigurable too.I love the idea of modular buildings, but this doesn&#x27;t quite seem to fit. The materials don&#x27;t seem ideal for the wet climate, the manufacturing process seems expensive; either you buy or rent a cnc, or have panels manufactured &#x27;locally&#x27; then trucked. And the fact that it&#x27;s precision cnc suggests this is really not modular at all, but custom designed.Steel frame, and panels in standard sizes, eg steel sip, or home-poured foam-concrete, would be cheap, reusable&#x2F;recycleable, modular etc. Maybe ugly too, but then mount a nice wood, stone-veneer, or enamel rain screen&#x2F;siding, and interior paneling. reply ethanbond 7 hours agorootparentprevThey also need to be beautiful enough and stylistically timeless enough to be worth maintaining and remodeling. reply brigandish 7 hours agorootparentprev> Japanese houses depreciate over a ~30 year cycle where, at the end of that cycle, the only value left is in the land and the home is demolished and rebuilt.The rejoinder to that being that most housing I&#x27;ve seen in Japan is of scandalously low quality. reply ggm 8 hours agoparentprevBrad Pitt, New Orleans. $20m settlement.

Especially if you have a LARGE album.I&#x27;ll give you exactly the use case, and exactly why that is:I decided I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the family 1tb icloud plan anymore because 90% of it was being used up by my brother taking silly pictures and videos all the time. So I had him get an external SSD and set him up with the Photos app to download to it.~900gb of images and videos. It took OVER. A. MONTH. to download. The whole time the photos app was being very cagey about when it would bother to download. To an M1 iMac. With an 500mbit fiber connection and connected via ethernet.I think they do that on purpose to discourage people from quitting icloud. They want to keep you dependent on their cloud storage and they REALLY don&#x27;t want you taking your files back.I fucking hate icloud. I hate the way apple uses dark patterns and is so naggy about having an icloud membership when using an iPhone.

Either because they want to charge different prices for each platform (which means they have to sell them separately and charge you twice), or because they&#x27;re a streaming app with different licensing requirements between mobile and desktop.This isn&#x27;t even exclusive to Apple. When Microsoft added Android app support to Windows 11, they also updated the Amazon App Store version of Minecraft so that it&#x27;d only work on a Fire tablet, because they want you to buy the more expensive native port.

I don’t blame you for thinking otherwise though, it’s mainly poor reporting by Reuters and subsequently 9to5 that fails to explain this.The EU was first to look at the App Stores separately to determine how many users each store had and if they’d fall under the DMA, primarily driven by the idea that each OS has its own functionality and limitations and different purposes. I’ll owe you a citation because I don’t have it on hand, but if memory serves me right iOS and its App Store came out as the only one with sufficient EU users.This was undesirable from the EU’s standpoint as it meant that they weren’t able to regulate the other OSs&#x2F;App Stored so the EU reversed course and started treating them as one and the same.Cue Apple, who now appeal this finding, and argue that they are in fact separate. But as said above, that argument isn’t of Apple’s making, that’s how the EU saw it initially as well and how they started their threshold tests.> And if I have a MacBook, for instance, do I have a choice in downloading the app from the iPad store or the iPhone store? No, there’s just one for my device!This is not really a relevant argument, as it suggests that storefronts only exist as separate storefronts if you can download from it. The Google Play store is definitely a different store than the Apple App Store, but you can’t download from it.That said, on Apple Silicon MacBooks you can definitely download apps from the iPhone and iPad App Store.> And do I have a choice to use a non Apple App Store? No!On the MacBook? Yes, definitely. You can use Steam for example, or no store, or SetApp, etc, etc.> So while there might be multiple stores for Apple, there’s only one for my device from AppleAgain, opinion on the argument notwithstanding, this is a non sequitur. Whether you can only use one store on your device says little about it and how Apple’s App Stores are separate. There are actually some decent arguments to be made that Apple’s App Stores are not separate, but I don’t think this is one of them.> It’s like arguing that any monopoly isn’t actually a monopoly because the company has multiple physical locations. But the consumer has one choice, constrained by geographyThis is not a good analogy, because monopoly and monopoly powers are not analogous to running multiple stores. You can run multiple stores, say under two different brands or one for consumers and one for business customers and still be a monopoly for example.> I’m no lawyer but this is clearly a Hail Mary, perhaps suggested by some law firm to get a little more money out of AppleI used to be one in a former life, specialized in EU law and other international law, and for better or for worse this is not a Hail Mary. It’s actually a pretty solid argument within the context of the DMA because of the way DMA determines gatekeeper status (which was why the EU originally looked at the OSs and storefronts separately).That said, I think there are some bigger issues with the DMA and how it’s applied, suggesting that the EU is bending some of the regulations to target specific companies and services beyond plausible deniability. We’ll have to see how those shake out in court, because that’s generally a no-no.I expect some degree of compliance and some degree of long legal proceedings to get some clear boundaries set for both companies like Apple as well as the EU. The latter will then try to amend the legislation in an attempt to achieve their goal and the cycle will start over.

Or a pet fish cannot fly.If you buy or use a product that has constraints, you will be subject to those constraints. If you do not want to be subject to those constraints, do not buy or use those products.The people who argue for antitrust action against Apple seem to badly misunderstand anti-trust, at least compared to my own understanding.

Half the artifice of western civilization is built on the word &#x27;reasonable&#x27; and its interpretations in caselaw. However judgement cannot be the primary definition of a policy. &#x27;I know it when I see it&#x27; couldn&#x27;t even be the definition of obscenity - the court repaired it 10 years later with a more clearly delineated test in Miller.The definition of &#x27;platform&#x27; or &#x27;monopoly&#x27; or w&#x2F;e in the context of TFA is necessarily going to be technical and detailed, and encourage the entities it regulates to drive right up to the lines it draws. The job of the policymaker is to draw lines that accomplish her intentions. reply kemayo 16 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with \"I know it when I see it\" definitions is that there&#x27;s an inherent lack of consistency, in that two different judges aren&#x27;t guaranteed to reach the same conclusion.For instance: fair use of copyrighted content. The only way to know for sure whether something is fair use is to go through a lawsuit. You can be pretty confident in advance, but you genuinely can&#x27;t rule out the possibility that the judge will disagree with you because of something entirely subjective.Writing an objective technical definition can lead to rules lawyering, but the fix there is to improve the rules and close the loopholes. Otherwise you&#x27;re always at the mercy of being sued and happening to draw a judge in your case who makes a weird decision. reply linkgoron 14 hours agorootparentThe system already acknowledges that two judges are not guaranteed to reach the same conclusion.

Everything seems cool and all with the “natural language” approach to a legal system, up until the point the person in power decides to arbitrarily use it against the interests of the people they are governing.This is pretty much why laws in countries with at least somewhat functional legal systems tend to be treated more like pieces of code rather than whatever someone thinks things should vaguely and generally.The culture of “rules lawyering” is imo the best we can do if we want the legal system to treat everyone equally and impartially. Do you think that all the people involved in legal systems over thousands of years were just not enlightened enough to ever consider “why do we have all those ultra specific and codified laws, let’s just issue a list of general things like ‘don’t harm other people’ and ‘respect property of other people’ that would cover pretty much any undesirable behavior, and then call it a day?”.If anything, legal systems became more “rules lawyered” and more similar to code over time, precisely because the world has been moving in the direction of more fairness and equality. I mean, not that long ago at all, we had some of the most advanced nation-states being ruled by a single king&#x2F;queen&#x2F;emperor&#x2F;etc. And their word was not only a de-facto “absolute definition of the law”, but also de-jure (as opposed to some contemporary modern nation-states, like DRPK or Russia, that where laws technically exist on paper, but de-facto their codified definition doesn’t matter much at all,). reply avar 12 hours agorootparentSome dictatorships are doing stricter rules lawyering than any democracy, the \"issue\" being that there&#x27;s an unambiguous rule somewhere that the King is sovereign without limits on their power.I think you have this backwards. reply bbor 16 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]this culture of \"Rules Lawyering\"I’m with you on hating Apple but I actually like when judges stick to Rules Lawyering.

Samsung and Pixel phones have the same OS and generally share the same set of installable apps.I&#x27;m not saying Apple&#x27;s argument is necessarily going to win. I&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s not \"silly\" -- we shouldn&#x27;t dismiss it like that. Because this isn&#x27;t about some \"common sense\" idea of what constitutes a store in consumer&#x27;s eyes, it&#x27;s about how this particular law defines a store, for the purposes of this law only, in technical terms. reply arghwhat 2 hours agorootparentDefending themselves in this case takes the form of a desperate lie. I very much find it silly and made up in the last minute as it does not align with any prior communication or how the user experiences things.The Google Play example is accurate. iPadOS does not differ from iOS in this context in that they both run exactly the same applications from the same app store - application that themselves can implement iPad or iOS specific behavior of course, but that is internal to the app, not a difference in the store.In the same vein, Android TV is a separate OS from that in Google Pixels which is very different from that for a Samsung Galaxy - but they all run Android apps. Whether you give a name to the shared foundation (Android here, and what used to be iOS before they decided that iPad-specific features deserved distinct marketing) is not important - Apple users know that they see the same store with the same apps on all their devices (with an apple TV caveat as fewer developers add app support).(An app can itself declares requirements and dependencies that will hide it for particular devices, but if those filters counted the number would be way higher than 5 - it would be per-model, per-OS-minor)The Mac App Store has been marketed separately, so that makes two. An Apple TV compatible app also have to live up to some different requirements, but having apps filtered to a device based on its declared support and requirements is not different than similar restrictions within iPhone apps, and so it is not itself enough to fork the singular App Store. It is still presented as one familiar entity to users. reply stale2002 16 hours agorootparentprev> Because this isn&#x27;t about some \"common sense\" idea of what constitutes a store in consumer&#x27;s eyesYou misunderstand the law.Common sense is bedrock defining feature of the law.There are all sorts of laws that have words and interpretations which could be argued either way.And the way that we choose between those interpretations is often through things like juries.

It&#x27;s an ad-ridden piece of spyware. Because everyone were using ShareIt to share music and photos, and I refused to use it out of paranoia and a general dislike of intrusive ads, I got some reputation of being the \"weird nerd\".Thankfully Google Files got popular later.It&#x27;s pretty easy to imagine how a bad application like ShareIt or TikTok may be required to be considered socially normal. reply HumblyTossed 12 hours agorootparent> I got some reputation of being the \"weird nerd\".So what!?

So they optionally offer an apk download, just like WhatsApp did for years. reply jgilias 17 hours agorootparentprevWell then, don’t use DJI stuff.I’m pretty sure Apple will keep positioning their App Store as the official authorized way to get software for iDevices. I’m also pretty sure that there’s going to be huge inertia there and most of the apps are going to be on App Store still. So your ability to live in a walled garden won’t be affected much. Yes, some apps will move away from the App Store, and I suggest you to vote with your wallet and not use them.I for one absolutely cherish the ability to install software I choose on the device that’s supposedly mine. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentSure, this is why I have mixed feeling rather than straight up opposition.Would it be nice to be able to install third party apps? I’d like… a GNU store, maybe a Suckless store, Panic is decent. There are pros, it isn’t all cons.There is a downside, though, snooping companies like Facebook and Google are going to use this to circumvent Apple’s privacy rules.I disagree that this is a case of “vote with your wallet.” I already voted with my wallet by opting into a less open ecosystem for my phone. In general, individuals voting with their wallets have limited reach, this is why people do things like join unions or co-ops.It was good to have at least one popular platform that enforced at least some bare minimum standards that we could opt in to, that most app authors wanted to support. reply idle_zealot 16 hours agorootparent> In general, individuals voting with their wallets have limited reach, this is why people do things like join unions or co-opsCorrect. There are two problems here:1. Apple won&#x27;t let people install the software they want on their phones 2. Lots of companies want to get their software installed on your phone by whatever means to control it and turn it against your interestsBoth of these are bad. The DMA fixes 1, but HN users consistently complain that in doing so it will prevent Apple from mitigating 2. But relying on a company like Apple to stop other companies from abusing users is not a reasonable state of things. People should, through collective action (probably a law) prevent this abuse. And the DMA does not preclude this. reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentMaybe living in the US has made me unnecessarily pessimistic about the likelihood of having consumer protection laws make that last step. I’d be happy to be wrong but I suspect we’ll end up in the local pessimism. reply jgilias 14 hours agorootparentOh, but then you don’t have anything to worry about. As far as I understand nothing will change in the US regarding App Store policies. It’s just the EU where this would apply. replydktp 16 hours agorootparentprevIf my Mac only allowed downloads from the Apple store, it would essentially render it useless (for me)Likewise, I like to think that opening up my phone could make it more useful reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentAll of my non-phone devices are Linux. I like the separation there. Phones are not really good devices for working on, and as a result, aren’t that fun to tinker with. I’d rather just leave it locked down.The app based model that phones use is kind of crap. I will happily pipe together a bunch of little scripts and programs in bash to make a workflow for my niche usecase. But, phone apps don’t seem to focus on inter-operability. As a result, in the phone ecosystem you just have to find an app, or the task is basically impossible. If I’m not going to use third party store, and there are fewer apps in the official App Store, I’ll probably use my phone less.On the bright side, maybe making the phone ecosystem worse will open up room for more proper Linux phones with the full desktop suite of tools. reply Y-bar 18 hours agorootparentprevLet&#x27;s say Apple gets forced to allow third party app stores. Would there be anything stopping Apple from requiring those app stores to have real, actual individual be responsible for the actively policing those stores for things like fraud and actual malware? For example if there are too many reports of fraud or abuse though some store Apple could hold that individual responsible and or withdraw the signing key for their store? I would guess something like could help. reply throwaway22056 18 hours agorootparentYes, the EU. It forces Apple to allow sideloading - that means installing apps with no restrictions, from any sources such as any random website. A store is just an app, thus there will be no way for Apple to force alternative stores to anything.There doesn&#x27;t even need to be a person that could be held responsible, or they could be easily masked behind anonymity of the web or layers of white horses &#x2F; phished identities. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentIs that what they are planning to do?I definitely can see a “store is just an app, you must allow third party apps” as a sort of maximal approach. But treating app stores as a sort of special thing that requires extra permission and coordination doesn’t seem totally impossible.It could be sort of nice if each store was isolated inside a different sandbox and had it’s own filesystem. (I wouldn’t be that surprised if something like that happened because it is both justifiable from a security point of view, and also mildly annoying for people who want to use third party stores, which I guess Apple would prefer). reply throwaway22056 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s what they did, the law is approved and will come into effect soon. A store is just an app like any other apps - e.g. your browser. If you can download an app from the web, you can download a store, and the store can download other apps. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentThat’s unfortunate reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentI find it weird that this comment was downvoted while my comment up two was upvoted. If you agree that a store should be something other than just another app, then you ought to agree that it is unfortunate if this is their plan.If you agree but downvoted because you think it isn’t their plan, maybe you can show us why the person I responded to here was wrong? That would be reassuring! reply Y-bar 18 hours agorootparentprevBut from my perspective sideloading is not necessarily a separate on-device store.An on-device store would be equivalent to Steam which first need to be installed on the device for example via the regular iOS App Store or sideloading or another already installed app store.Sideloading would be downloading from a web page or secondary device or similar method.Separate stores would be a decent middle-ground for my part when less tech-savvy people inevitably ask me \"can I trust this app\" I can reply with \"are you about to install it from store X or Y or download elsewhere?\". If the answer is \"that store from Epic Games\" I could sigh quietly and say \"it&#x27;s likely okay\". reply throwaway22056 18 hours agorootparentYes, and you if sideload a store app from a website (a random one, or Facebook, MS, etc), Apple is out of control in that case. They could ban the altstore from their own App Store, but not from the web.My problem is exactly with these \"safe stores from well known companies\". Apple helps me. EpicStore and MetaStore helps them sidestep the anti-tracking and anti-spam rules of App Store. reply smoldesu 18 hours agorootparent> Apple helps me.That&#x27;s a bit of a stretch. Apple, much like every other business, cares about you insofar as you&#x27;re a paying customer. That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t let you use... well, stuff like third-party payment processors. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentThat’s not quite true, lots of other businesses don’t care about you insofar as you’re a paying customer, they care about insofar as you are eyeballs for their actual customers.Apple’s business model is mostly: give money, get services and devices. That they are able to sell this as a nice special plus is a huge indictment of the computer and OS market. reply throwaway22056 17 hours agorootparentprevWhich is great, I much prefer Apple Pay and their overview of all subscriptions etc and them actually enforcing what changes I make there, as opposed to the situation on Android where I was charged by custom payment gateway implementations after cancelling the subscription many times and Google just told me to take it up with the app vendor who never responded. reply smoldesu 17 hours agorootparentHey, more power to you. The good news is that after the DMA rolls out, Apple doesn&#x27;t have to stop offering any of that. You can keep using it until Apple stops providing the function, same as you would have without the DMA.I&#x27;m glad we have passionate Apple enthusiasts helping us prove how harmless market regulation actually is. reply throwaway22056 17 hours agorootparentThe problem is that app vendors will no longer be forced to use it. That seriously hurts my sense of security as a user of the platform - the very thing why I chose it. reply eitally 17 hours agorootparentBut it doesn&#x27;t affect Apple&#x27;s 1P app store, app review process, or other security processes at all, so if you are content exclusively using Apple&#x27;s App Store then there&#x27;s no impact. If you look at the Android ecosystem, there have been all kinds of app stores for years. Some run by hardware OEMs, some open source (FDroid), and some that are run by app review sites that basically function as sideloading hubs for pre-GA versions of apps. Arguably, things generally work and overall I don&#x27;t believe system security has been negatively affected.The real issues here are with the payment processing captured by Apple & Google, and why their gatekeeping (net negative to competition) should be a profit center for them while at the same time being a net negative (arguable) to consumers. replyfsflover 16 hours agorootparentprev> I’d like a GNU storeThis is the reality on GNU&#x2F;Linux phones, Librem 5 and Pinephone. reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentTrue.

Here&#x27;s one way it could have happened:Suppose Apple had plans to monetise iMessage at the time it was developed and eventually decided against it for whatever reason. This would leave the company with a an app running on most phones. What to do? I can easily imaging someone standing up in a meeting and suggesting: \"Well, running it costs very little, why don&#x27;t we just minimise the cost of running it and keep providing it for as long as the cost is low?\" reply bloppe 16 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t change that fact that they&#x27;re monetizing it via hardware sales reply Arnt 1 hour agorootparentYou mean that whenever an organisation pays for a loss-making operation using income from its hardware sales, that operation is monetised via hardware sales?That doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. It makes monetisation be a synonym of funding.Surely, monetisation means that you do x in order to earn income from hardware sales. That is to say, your motivation counts, or rationale. The rationale is of course only known to people who attend the relevant budget meetings. reply throwaway22056 18 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know, it doesn&#x27;t to me. To me it sounds like they provide a convenient free service like many other free services (Telegram, WhatsApp, ...), but limit it to their actual customers so it stays limited in scope and they don&#x27;t need to start selling data and ad space like others do to support it. reply bloppe 15 hours agorootparentThis might be true in Europe, but not in America. In Europe, nobody uses iMessage, because WhatsApp got there first. iMessage is locked down and therefore less useful than WhatsApp. Despite the fact that iMessage is pre-installed in iPhones, and you can&#x27;t change your default messaging app, and everything about the iPhone encourages you to use it, people still download WhatsApp instead. That&#x27;s how things are supposed to be; the more useful, more open, more technically capable service won out. And no, WhatsApp does not have ads, nor does it collect your data due to its E2E encryption.In America, iMessage got there first. Even though it&#x27;s technically worse than WhatsApp, enough people use it (a majority) that it doesn&#x27;t matter that it handicaps its own users with SMS and green bubbles. People think it&#x27;s all the other phones&#x27; fault rather than the iPhone&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s a massive driver of iPhone sales, and Apple execs are on the record acknowledging that.That&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to work. The better messaging platforms should be competitive.

This is the point of gatekeeper regulations: Ensuring that services large enough to have significant impact on people are well-behaved and compatible.The argument that iMessage is a service provided by Apple for Apple products and that they should be allowed to do whatever with their products is the same argument they&#x27;ve used to restrict App Store, force developers to use their payment systems and charge outrageous cuts of every payment a user might make through there.iMessage plays quite a notable role in this, as a user whose friends use iMessage (more prevalent in parts of the U.S. I think) might feel unable to move away in order to be connected to their iMessage-using friends, in turn ensuring that they keep buying iPhones and paying Apple a 30% cut of all their app subscriptions from Duolingo to Disney+. reply makeitdouble 16 hours agorootparentprevThat would be fair enough if they didn&#x27;t have a message trail of execs positing iMessage is a stake against android that they can&#x27;t let go. reply djfdat 18 hours agorootparentprevfree in that case, being subsidized by other purchases and the value of lock-in on those users.

For this to apply here, either Apple would have to be caught lying about their numbers (not impossible), the EU would have to lower the minimums, or the US would have to create their own counterpart as iMessage is much more popular in the US. reply pmontra 17 hours agorootparentEverybody really use WhatsApp to send messages to friends here, especially in group chats.

For messaging apps, being in a location where your entire social network uses one app is indeed a case where the average person ends up forced to use that app as picking another option means not talking to your social network (unwanted) or having to convert everyone else (unreasonable).

I&#x27;m no expert on the Apple developer tools, but if it&#x27;s anything like Android, apps for a 2022 iPhone are a lot closer to apps for a 2022 iPad than they are to a 2018 iPhone.With Android, new API&#x2F;ABI versions are released with breaking changes, forcing a different set of apps to be available for each version, but the codebase remains mostly the same across form factors at any given point in time.I think the Commission are more than capable of seeing through Apple&#x27;s artificial distinctions here, but the question is whether the General Court will! reply rob74 18 hours agoprev> But Apple may succeed in arguing that its app stores for other devices should be excluded. (The Mac App Store should already be safe, as users are free to download and install apps direct from developers.)And I imagine Apple would just love to close this historical \"loophole\", but is probably afraid of the backlash... reply grishka 18 hours agoparentThat would not be possible because Macs are much more open by design. There are so many methods to subvert such a restriction, and most of them can&#x27;t be removed without significantly degrading the utility of the OS.

Or do they hope that they end up with a precedent that they can apply to all their devices instead of just one? reply turquoisevar 6 hours agoparentThe long and short of it is that the EU, in determining the gatekeepers, looked at the monthly active users for each store separately on the premise that each OS (i.e., iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) is separate from each other with its own constraints, functionality, and purpose.The EU then realized that the only App Store that meets the monthly active user threshold is the iOS App Store (and maybe iPadOS, I am not 100% sure as I write this, the preliminary findings were a while back), which wasn’t desirable for the EU as they want to regulate as much as possible. Hence, the EU basically said: “fuck it, we’ll treat them all as one; the DMA is written vague enough that we can get away with this.”Apple is now appealing this finding and echoed the EU’s original stance that these are to be considered separate, with each their own monthly active user threshold to meet. reply guitarbill 18 hours agoparentprevAndroid is quite a bit more popular than iPhones in the EU (roughly 66% vs 33%).

Zach Rausch and Jon Haidt Mar 29, 2023 349 Share this post The Teen Mental Illness Epidemic is International, Part 1: The Anglosphere www.afterbabel.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 177 Share It is now widely accepted that an epidemic of mental illness began among American teens in the early 2010s. What caused it? Many commentators point to events in the USA around that time, such as a particularly horrific school shooting in 2012. But if the epidemic started in many nations at the same time, then such country-specific theories would not work. We’d need to find a global event or trend, and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis doesn’t match the timing at all, as Jean Twenge and I have shown. In our 2018 book The Coddling of the American Mind, Greg Lukianoff and I presented evidence that the same trends were happening in Canada and the United Kingdom—not just the rise in depression and anxiety, but also the overprotection of children, the rise of “safetyism,” and the shouting down of speakers on university campuses when students deemed the speaker to be “harmful.” It seemed that all the Anglo nations were setting up their children for failure in the same ways at the same time. In 2019 I went on a speaking tour of Australia and New Zealand (thanks to Think Inc) and discovered that the same trends were coming, more slowly, to the Southern hemisphere Anglo nations too. I then created two new collaborative review documents, one for Australia, and one for New Zealand, to gather all the empirical studies and journalistic accounts I could find. In early 2020, just as COVID swept in, I hired Zach Rausch as a research assistant to help me handle these collaborative review docs. I connected with Zach, who was finishing his master’s degree in Psychological Science at SUNY New Paltz, after reading his blog post about his research related to The Coddling. Zach and I created many more collaborative review docs for many more countries and topics, which you can find (and add to) on this page. In 2021, as I was beginning to work on the Babel project, I told Zach that it was urgent that we figure out just how international the mental illness epidemic was. Is it just happening in the five countries of what is sometimes called The Anglosphere? Is it all Western countries? Is it happening everywhere? Go figure it out and report back to me. The rest of this post is Part 1 of Zach’s report, in his voice. I think his findings are momentous and should cause an immediate global rethinking of what children need to have a healthy childhood, and what obstacles to development arrived around the globe around 2012. — Jon Haidt (Addendum April 19th: Zach published his second post on international mental health trends. The post explores trends in the five Nordic Nations: You can read the report here). When Jon first asked me to figure out whether teen mental health had collapsed around the globe after 2012, I thought he was nuts. The task felt impossible and beyond what I thought I could accomplish. But it was precisely this kind of work that I aspired to do. I set aside my doubt, put my head down, and gathered every relevant study I could find on teen mental health trends across the globe. In a series of posts, I will share with you what I have found so far. I address the Anglosphere today. In future posts, I’ll show what I have learned about Scandinavia and other developed nations and what I have learned from five international surveys, each with data from dozens of nations. There is much more to be done, especially beyond Western countries. The short answer to Jon’s question is: Teen mental health plummeted across the Western world in the early 2010s, particularly for girls and particularly in the most individualistic nations. The longer answer begins below and will continue in parts 2 and 3. What Happened to Teens in the Five Anglosphere Countries? As Jon mentioned in the introduction to this post, he and Greg Lukianoff had already found evidence that the mental illness epidemic was occurring in Canada, the UK, and the USA. But it has been more than four years since the publication of The Coddling of the American Mind, and we now have access to a lot more data, so let me run through the five countries. 1. The USA In two previous posts of the After Babel Substack, Jon has shown the astounding rise of mental illness among American adolescents since 2010. Therefore, I won’t cover the United States in much detail. However, I will include a few figures to provide a baseline for the countries we explore in the rest of this post. For each country, I try to show at least one graph or study on mood disorders (anxiety and/or depression), which is usually self-reported, and one on something related to self-harm or psychiatric hospitalization, which is usually not based on self-reports from teens. (Note that I defer the discussion of suicide rates to a future post. You can find data and graphs about suicide rates in each of the Collaborative Review Docs that I link to.) Figure 1 shows the percentage of US teens since 2004 who reported having a major depressive episode in the last year. Figure 1. Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year. NSDUH data, see section 1.1.2 of the Adolescent mood disorders collaborative review doc. As you can see, there was no sign of a problem before 2010, and by 2015 a depression epidemic was in full force. Today, more than one in four American girls (ages 12-17) report having a major depressive episode in the last year. And more than one in eight boys said the same. Figure 2 provides behavioral (non-self-report) data on the number per 100,000 teens admitted yearly to hospitals because they harmed themselves, primarily by cutting. Figure 2. Hospital admissions for self-harm, younger teens (ages 10-14), CDC data. See section 2.1.1 of the Adolescent mood disorders collaborative review doc. In one of the most harrowing and unprecedented trends of the 21st century, young teenage girls were hospitalized for self-harm in 2020 at just about three times the rate they were in 2010. We see similar but slightly less steep trends among the 15-19-year-old girls (we also see this same gendered pattern in self-poisoning). Here’s one additional graph to show that the sharp rise in mental illness was concentrated in young people—it was not happening across the board to all age groups: Figure 3. Percent US Anxiety Prevalence. National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). To summarize, four trends emerged in the data from the USA, which we will call the “basic pattern.” They include: A) A substantial increase in adolescent anxiety and depression rates begins in the early 2010s. B) A substantial increase in adolescent self-harm rates or psychiatric hospitalizations begins in the early 2010s. C) The increases are larger for girls than for boys (in absolute terms). D) The increases are larger for Gen Z than for older generations (in absolute terms). Note that there are two ways to calculate increases. We can measure an increase in absolute terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% of teens with a diagnosis is a ten percentage-point increase, or we can report it in relative terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% is a 300% increase, relative to the anchor point. Both are important. From a utilitarian or public health point of view, we care more about the absolute increase, for it tells us the number of people affected. From a psychological research point of view, we also care about the relative increase since a large relative increase may alert us that something is changing for that group, even if its illness rate only moves from 2.1% to 4.3%. We decided to report the relative changes on our graphs since that is hard to calculate by eye. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the absolute increase from 2010 to 2021 was much larger for girls (17.3%) than for boys (7.1%), and that jumps out at you as soon as you look at the graph. However, the relative increase was slightly larger for boys (161%) than for girls (145%), which tells us that whatever is happening, it’s also affecting boys quite a lot. Subscribe 2. Canada With this basic pattern in mind, let’s move north to see how Canadian teens are doing. Jon and I include all of the studies we could find on Canadian youth in an open-source Google Doc titled “The Coddling of the Canadian Mind? A Collaborative Review.” If you know of other studies to add or want to learn more, please check it out. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), one of Canada’s most extensive nationwide surveys, collects national data bi-annually on various health-related measures. Using CCHS data, I re-graphed a few key mental health figures. Figure 4 shows the percentage of Canadian males who described their mental health by choosing either “Excellent” or “Very Good.” Between 2003 and 2012, young men (ages 15-30) rated their mental health better than the two older groups, reaching 78% in 2009. However, within a few years, the percentage fell to 66%, becoming the age group with the lowest percentage of “excellent or very good” mental health. Figure 4. Excellent or very good mental health, Canadian males. Canadian Community Health Survey (2003-2019). See section 1.3.2 of The Coddling of the Canadian Mind? A Collaborative Review.1 The change for females is even more striking. Figure 5 shows the same pattern as the males, except that the youngest females dropped from 76.5% in 2009 to an astounding 54% in 2019, far lower than every other age group. As in the USA, the mental health of young Canadian females fell off a cliff in the 2010s. Also, as in the USA, the decline is large for Gen Z, and there is no decline for Canadians over the age of 47. Figure 5. Excellent or very good mental health, Canadian women. Canadian Community Health Survey (2003-2019). See section 1.3.2 of The Coddling of the Canadian Mind? A Collaborative Review. Self-report studies are important––we should listen to what people say about their own mental health. But changes over time could reflect factors other than actual increases in mental illness, such as “concept creep” and changing trends in the desirability of having a diagnosis.2 Figure 6 shows data from the Canadian National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, plotting the rate per 100,000 Ontarian teens who went to the emergency department for harming themselves. Figure 6. Emergency department visits for self-harm, Ontarian teens (Ages 13-17), Canadian National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) data, graphed by Gardner et al. (2019), and re-graphed in 1.3.3 of The Coddling of the Canadian Mind? A Collaborative Review. Just like in the United States, there has been an extraordinary increase in self-harm hospitalizations, with a highly gendered nature. Since 2010, there has been a 138% increase in self-harm hospitalization for 13-17-year-old girls (from a low of 294.0 per 100,000 teens in 2010 to a high of 701.6 per 100,000 in 2017). The boys show an increase too, but from a much lower baseline, and there is no spike around 2012. Again, the pattern and timing are very similar to the USA: no sign of a problem before 2010, and then something terrible happens to Canadian teens in the early 2010s, especially to the girls. Overall, Canada also shares the basic pattern. Although we do not have specific changes in rates of anxiety and depression, we see a significant decline in mental well-being among young Canadians. The changes in well-being and self-harm are larger for girls than for boys, in both absolute and relative terms. And the changes in well-being were much larger for the youngest cohort than for the older ones. 3. The United Kingdom Because Jon and Greg had been studying the UK along with the US, all of the studies on teenage mental health trends in the UK were included in the original collaborative review doc, “Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010: A Collaborative Review.” An essential UK data source, the United Kingdom National Health Survey, examined trends among 11- to 15-year-old English boys and girls for anxiety and depressive disorders at 3 points (1999, 2004, 2017). The researchers applied rigorous, detailed, and consistent methods to assess various types of disorders according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) diagnostic criteria. Figure 7. Trends among 11- to 15-year-old English boys and girls for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders at 3 points in time (1999, 2004, 2017). (Graphed by Jean Twenge. We can’t tell where the elbow is since we only have data from 3 specific years.) See 1.3.3 in Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010. Figure 7 shows that from 1999 to 2004, depression rates were steady for girls, while anxiety rates began to increase. For boys, anxiety was steady, while depression rates decreased. However, from 2004 to 2017, we see substantially larger increases in both mood disorders for girls and large spikes in anxiety for boys. The most recent update of the UK National Health Survey (2021) did not include the same items on anxiety and depression. However, from 2017 to 2021, the researchers did find that rates of probable mental disorders among 11-16-year-old girls increased by 38.5%, from 14.3% to 19.8%. For boys, rates increased by 26.8%, from 12.3% to 15.6%. Because the UK National Health survey looked at just three points in time, we can’t know when the increase began between 2004 and 2017. Fortunately, we can get better temporal resolution from a second study which took measurements annually, The Good Childhood Report, which presents data from Understanding Society: UK Household Longitudinal Study, UK's most comprehensive long-term national survey on child subjective well-being. As shown in Figure 8, the average happiness scores between boys and girls were no different in 2009. However, after 2009, the girls' rate began to drop, with an acceleration after 2013. The boys' rate dropped too, although the drop started later (after 2014) and was not quite as sharp. Figure 8. Trends in children’s happiness with different aspects of life by gender, UK, 2009-10 to 2019-20, graphed in The Good Childhood Report (2022)—data from Understanding Society survey. See 1.3.4 of Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010. See p. 52 of the doc for trends before 2009. Happiness scores increased for girls from 1996-2008, while boys' rates rose in the late 90s, fell in the first few years of the 2000s, and then rose again around 2005. Figure 9 shows one of the most sudden spikes in self-harm I’ve seen in any of the datasets I’ve looked at. In 2011, 13-16-year-old girls had a rate of 688.5 hospitalizations per 100,000. Within two years, that number had jumped to 1235 hospitalizations per 100,000 (a 79.4% increase). This graph confirms something we see in the American data repeatedly: something big seems to have happened to girls around 2012. Figure 9. UK Teens, Self-harm rates per 100,000. Aurum and GOLD datasets of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). See 1.3.6 in Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010, from Cybulski, Ashcroft, Carr, Garg, Chew-Graham, Kapur, & Webb (2021). Regraphed by Zach Rausch. As this post is already so long, I won’t dive into the data on the various nations within the UK, but the trends are very similar. The Scottish government recently published a report (study 1.5.4.1) detailing their concern about the mental health decline of teenage girls in their country since 2010. These disturbing trends are also happening in Wales (study 1.5.4.4). We don’t have a separate document for Ireland, but every study I’ve found indicates that Irish youth are going through the same struggles (studies 1.5.4.2 and 1.5.4.3) as those in the UK. So, to recap: The basic pattern emerges in the UK: Rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm have risen dramatically since 2010, especially among girls. The girls always had larger increases in absolute terms, although on two graphs (figures 7 and 9), the boys had larger increases in relative terms. I have not yet found data allowing cross-generational comparisons, so that is still an open question. Let’s now take a look at Australia and New Zealand. Share 4. Australia You can view all of the studies we found on mental health trends in Australia in our document titled “The Coddling of the Australian Mind? A Collaborative Review.” One of Australia’s most extensive health surveys comes from Australia’s Health, an 18-year-running flagship report involving thousands of Australians across the continent. Figure 10 illustrates the changes in the percentage of Australian youth and adults reporting high or very high psychological distress between 2002 and 2020. Before 2012, rates among the four age/gender groups remained generally steady. In 2014, this began to change. The percentage of young females (16-24) who reported high or very high psychological distress grew from 14.2% in 2013 to 35.1% in 2020. Figure 10. Persons aged 16+ reporting high or very high psychological distress by age group and sex, 2002 to 2020. Australia's Health Snapshots 2022: Mental Health of Young Australians (2022). Data can be downloaded here. See 1.3.4 in The Coddling of the Australian Mind? A similar pattern emerges in psychiatric emergency department visits, also tracked by Australia’s Health (Figure 11). There is little variation among age groups between 2007 and 2011. However, around 2012, hospitalization among 12-24-year-old girls and women began rising, from 558 per 100,000 in 2010 to 1012 per 100,000 in 2020, an 81% relative increase. Figure 11. Overnight admitted mental health hospitalization rate (per 100,000 population) with specialized care, by age group and sex, 2006–07 to 2019–20. Australia's Health Snapshots 2022: Mental Health of Young Australians (2022). See section 1.3.4 of The Coddling of the Australian Mind? Regarding self-harm rates, Figure 12 illustrates that the only age group that has had increases in self-harm hospitalizations since 2010 are the youngest girls, those ages 15-19 and 20-24. All of the older age groups show declines in self-harm rates. Figure 12. Female self-harm hospitalizations (per 100,000 population) by age group, 2009-2020. Data from 2019–20 National Hospital Morbidity Database—Intentional self-harm hospitalizations. (see additional data here) Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. See section 1.3.9 of The Coddling of the Australian Mind? Numerous other datasets in Australia support these general findings. For example, intentional poisoning exposure calls rose most rapidly for girls aged 15 to 19. Figure 13 reveals that the spike began in 2012. The study does not provide the precise number of incidents per year by age group and gender, so, I am unable to provide the exact percent change since 2010, however it is clearly up by more than 100% for girls aged 15-19. Figure 13. Trends in intentional self-poisoning, ages 5–19 years, 2006-2016. Rates per 100,000. See 1.3.14 in The Coddling of the Australian Mind? Graph created by Cairns, Karanges, Wong, Brown, Robinson, Pearson, Dawson, & Buckley (2019), with text added by Zach Rausch. The researchers found that “[the] effect was driven by increased poisonings in those born after 1997, suggesting a birth cohort effect. Females outnumbered males 3:1.” In other words, Australia’s Gen Z girls suddenly started poisoning themselves in much larger numbers in 2012. In sum, Australia, like the US, UK, and Canada, fits the basic pattern. Rates of self-harm, psychological distress, overnight psychiatric hospitalization, and self-poisoning have all increased since the early 2010s, especially for girls and for Gen Z. (We note that self-harm hospitalizations for 15-19-year-old girls have declined since 2018—this will be an important trend to keep track of). 5. New Zealand You can view all of the studies we found on mental health trends in New Zealand in our document titled The Coddling of the Kiwi Mind? A Collaborative Review. The increase in self-reported anxiety and depression in New Zealand is among the steepest across all of the Anglo countries. Figure 14, with data from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, shows that in 2007, the percentage of 15-24-year-old males and females who said they had been given an anxiety diagnosis was approximately 3%. By 2020, the percentage of young females with an anxiety diagnosis had grown to 24.8% (a 259% increase compared to 2011). Males also rose to 9% in 2020 (a 131% increase). These increases are so large, and the starting numbers are so low (just 3% of girls had an anxiety diagnosis in 2007?) that we suspect that this graph shows, in part, changing diagnostic criteria and greater awareness of anxiety. We do not believe that the underlying rates of anxiety disorders increased as quickly as the lines in Figure 11 suggest. Nonetheless, given what we are seeing in all of the Anglosphere countries, and given the self-harm data below, we believe that much or most of the rise is real. In any case, in 2007, only one in 30 girls thought she had an anxiety disorder; by 2020, it was one in four. Figure 14. “Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have an anxiety disorder? This includes panic attacks, phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder?” New Zealand Ministry of Health, New Zealand Health Survey 2020. See 1.3.1 in The Coddling of the Kiwi Mind? Note that the survey was not conducted between 2008-2010, so we compared 2020 data with 2011. When we compare across age groups, we find that the youngest age group (ages 15-24) had the lowest rates of anxiety in 2007 (2.6%), and by 2020, they had the highest rates among all age groups (16.3%, a 328.8% increase since 2011). Figure 15. Percentage of New Zealanders with an anxiety diagnosis by age group. New Zealand Ministry of Health, New Zealand Health Survey 2020. See 1.3.1 in The Coddling of the Kiwi Mind? Note that the survey was not conducted between 2008-2010. We see a similar pattern for depression (Figure 16), with low rates at the beginning of the 2000s but a steep rise in the second half of the 2010s, particularly for girls. Figure 16. “Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have depression?” New Zealand Ministry of Health, New Zealand Health Survey 2020. See 1.3.1 in The Coddling of the Kiwi Mind? Note that the survey was not conducted between 2008-2010. The age distributions for depression also map similarly to anxiety, except that the sharpest rise for the youngest cohort happened in 2020 (see 1.3.1 of The Coddling of the Kiwi Mind). In another study, using a series of cross-sectional surveys between 2001-2019 of secondary school students (mostly between the ages of 13-17), Kylie Sutcliffe and colleagues (2022) found that “after relative stability from 2001 to 2012, there were large declines in mental health to 2019.” Since 2012, the researchers found that the proportion of youth reporting “good well-being” decreased as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts increased significantly. There was, as usual, a gendered effect, with girls showing steeper declines in mental well-being (as well as important variation by ethnic group, with worsening trends among Māori, Pacific, and Asian students). To examine behavioral changes, I plotted the total number of discharges from public hospitals in New Zealand for intentional self-harm from 2005 to 2019 (Using data from the New Zealand Ministry of Health’s National Minimum Dataset). Figure 17. Total public hospital discharges for intentional self-harm by age and sex, 2005-2019. Ministry of Health, New Zealand. Data from The Ministry of Health’s National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). See 1.3.6 in The Coddling of the Kiwi Mind? These are total discharges, not rates per 100,000 population, so a small portion of the increase could reflect population increase. But that would not explain why—as in the other Anglo countries—the rise is far greater among girls than boys, and it is not linear—it accelerates in the early 2010s. In sum, the basic pattern reappears in New Zealand: Depression, anxiety, and self-harm rates started rising around 2012, with girls and Gen Z hit the hardest. Leave a comment 6. Conclusion In sum, all five Anglosphere countries exhibit the same basic pattern:3 A) A substantial increase in adolescent anxiety and depression rates begins in the early 2010s. B) A substantial increase in adolescent self-harm rates or psychiatric hospitalizations begins in the early 2010s. C) The increases are larger for girls than for boys (in absolute terms). D) The increases are larger for Gen Z than for older generations (in absolute terms). Why did this happen in the same way at the same time in five different countries? What could have affected girls around the English-speaking world so strongly and in such a synchronized way? As discussed in previous posts and as Twenge et al. (2022) showed, it can’t be the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The timing of that event is exactly the opposite of what you’d expect, namely: the epidemic should have started in 2009 and then gotten progressively better after 2012 as the economy improved in the USA and other countries. In an earlier post, Jean Twenge showed that it can’t be caused by rising academic pressure either. And it certainly can’t be caused by the most popular theory we hear in the USA: school shootings and other stress-inducing events. Why would school shootings or active shooter drills implemented only in the USA lead to an immediate epidemic across the entire English-speaking world?4 At this point, there is only one theory we know of that can explain why the same thing happened to girls in so many countries at the same time: the rapid global movement from flip phones (where you can’t do social media) to smartphones and the phone-based childhood. The first smartphone with a front-facing camera (the iPhone 4) came out in 2010, just as teens were trading in their flip phones for smartphones in large numbers. (Few teens owned an iPhone in its first few years). Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, which gave the platform a huge boost in publicity and users. So 2012 was the first year that very large numbers of girls in the developed world were spending hours each day posting photos of themselves and scrolling through hundreds of carefully edited photos of other girls. If you suddenly transform the social lives of girls, putting them onto platforms that prioritize social comparison and performance, platforms where we know that heavy users are three times more likely to be depressed than light users, might that have some impact on the mental health of girls around the world? We think so, but if anyone can offer another explanation that fits the graphs we’ve shown in this post, we’d love to hear it. This concludes the first part of my report. In Part 2, I’ll examine the Scandinavian countries. In Part 3, I’ll examine studies that collected evidence from multiple countries, mostly in Europe. In later posts, I’ll examine the limited data we have from non-Western nations. To give you a sneak preview, there are cultural variations within the West, and the Anglosphere was hit a bit harder than other regions. Whatever it was that changed about childhood in the early 2010s, it took the greatest toll on teens in the most individualistic nations.

We keep all of our collaborative review docs on this page: jonathanhaidt.com/reviews.5 1 Excellent or very good self-perceived general mental health: Respondents answered excellent or very good to the question, “In general, would you say your mental health is... ?” 2 Many studies have also found that self-report studies are at risk of social-desirability bias and several other biases and limitations. But these considerations can’t explain why Gen Z girls changed en mass around the world around 2012. 3 We are just missing proof of anxiety and depression rates going up in Canada, and of Gen Z having larger increases in anxiety/depression in the UK. 4 This is not to say that perceptions of educational pressure or school shootings do not affect youth mental health. Instead, it is to say that these explanations do not line up with why teenage mental health collapsed in so many countries at the same time and in the same way. 5 Thanks to everyone who has helped support me with this post, particularly Jon, and Nicole Kitten.

I think that the cultural changes that lead to that have been running for far more time than people give credit for, and that social media is just the proverbial canary on the mine that made things explicit.Those changes are multi-generational changes, and more probably there are a multitude of factors behind it. Family structure, economy factors, crime, drugs, values and taboos changing too fast, uncertainty about the future.We will probably won&#x27;t find a culprit, but if I had to bet, I would say that far reaching event like the Vietnam war, reagonomics, the downsizing mania from the 80&#x27;s are probably more important factors than the recent creation of social networks. If we have to blame someone, maybe we should be looking at figures like Lee Yacoca, Carl Icahn, and Jack Welch instead of Mark Zukerberg. reply mathgradthrow 4 hours agoparentPeople are quick to blame social media because there are exceedingly plausible mechanisms by which social media could cause such a phenomenon, and there is tremendous profit in doing so and not just of the money variety. State level actors run secret influence campaigns on facebook, and more recently, just create and control whole social media platforms without oversight.The time for skepticism about the scale of the effect of social media has passed. reply vkou 4 hours agorootparentWhat about the public influence campaigns that are ran openly on television? How well have we managed to quantify the effect that has on the public?They also take place without any oversight. reply zdragnar 4 hours agorootparentPeople have long complained about television, both in terms of bad behavior of fictional characters and tone of news shows.At this point, though, young people are far more likely to doom scroll, fantasize about influence or whatever online than they are to be watching television.It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is a \"teen mental health crisis\"- television has been around long enough for several generations to go through teenage years without a similar experience. reply vkou 3 hours agorootparentSure, we complain, and complain, but have we done anything about it?If anything, we&#x27;ve relaxed our attitudes towards having a 24&#x2F;7 propaganda box shouting in our living room. reply thrawn0r 46 minutes agorootparentThe vast majority of people I know (38m,Germany) don&#x27;t regularly consume broadcast TV. Even my parents and their peers don&#x27;t (but to a lesser extent). reply bluescrn 29 minutes agorootparentprevTV wasn’t in your pocket everywhere, 24hrs a day. It was nowhere near as addictive. TV advertising&#x2F;propaganda isn’t able to be targeted at very specific demographics. And it required an attention span of more than 30 seconds. And for much of the history of TV, the selection of content was very limited.TV generally didn&#x27;t make you think the world was about to end in a climate apocalypse, or that we were days away from civil war&#x2F;world war 3, or that elections were rigged, or that science was untrustworthy, or that the other political tribe were pure evil, or that nazis&#x2F;commies&#x2F;pedos were absolutely everywhere.It was hard enough to tell what was true when most video footage was real (albeit often deceptively edited). And now we have AI-generated content added in to the mix. reply j4yav 3 hours agoparentprevSocial media is like that because a dopamine slot machine is about the best way to get people wired up ton stare at their phones all day, which it turns out is profitable for the people making the slot machine. reply mbgerring 4 hours agoparentprevSocial media is like that because it was deliberately designed to be addictive and we have a decade of documentation to back that up. reply mrweasel 1 hour agorootparentThat is something I&#x27;ve been think about, what if social media wasn&#x27;t designed to be addictive? There shouldn&#x27;t be anything inherently wrong in keeping in contact with your high school buddies on Facebook, so what if all the doom scrolling, likes, and corporate profiles where removed from Facebook? Would it be safer?I think there&#x27;s are huge risk that we are about to realize that either social media cannot be made safe, at all, or that it has been made dangerous in order to make a profit. Either way is terrifying and should lead to a larger skepticism of new technology. The horrible reality of social media, and the ad funded Internet is what has fueled my reluctance to accept crypto currency and AI into my life, as much as it is within my control to do so. reply sirsinsalot 10 minutes agorootparentThere&#x27;s nothing inherently \"wrong\" with communication, which at its simplest form is what \"social media\" is. It is just communication, with media. We have had this for a long while.The difference came when the businesses started optimising for engagement rather than happiness or connectedness to friends.Using engagement, which drives ad revenue, as the metric for success means you design a system that is addictive.The issue is optimising for engagement because humans are hardwired to find certain things moreish. Our dopamine system is easily abused and hijacked.Digital communication is good. Engagement optimisation is bad. This means businesses need another model of revenue outside ad revenue, which sadly is the most profitable.At a lower level, capitalism thrives on over-consumption. Fast fashion, doom scrolling, high-waste food produce supply chains; it&#x27;s all over-consumption that takes advantage of human psychology to fuel energy gradients from which profits can be found as cash transits across the gradient as people expend energy maintaining it.This might sound reductive, but until we realise that sustainability in ALL things is very important, and we built that into consumer mindset, we will keep being hijacked on every front.The question is, how do we design things that are SUSTAINABLE from revenue to user psychology? Given that we can&#x27;t collectively manage to do that to save our own planet, I don&#x27;t hold much hope in us even looking for an answer. The system is broken. Sustainability isn&#x27;t profitable. Humans are myopic. reply atoav 3 hours agoparentprevWhile I agree with the point that the causes of the current trend might be intergenerational, I think that this very important to mind fact is irrelevant for the topic.Social media is a problem to in societies and economies that are wildly different to the US, unless you mean us forming modern societies with groups bigger than 100 people is the problem or you mean those factors lead to the shape of social media as we have it today.I would imagine that social media would fuck with teenagers in ancient Rome in a similar way than it would with todays teens. There is something universal there.The problem is that social media in the way they are structured have zero incentives to build good structures for young adults to thrive in and 100% incentives to keep them in a state where they can be influenced. And that is an astable state of insecurity. Which is why many want to be influencer, because then at least you are the one doing the influencing. reply leksak 1 hour agoparentprevWhat would reagonomics and the Vietnam War have to do with teen mental health in say northern Europe? reply goodpoint 1 hour agorootparentEverything. reply freddie_mercury 5 hours agoparentprev> People blame social media, but they never ask why social media is like thatThe linked substack frequently asks why social media is like that. reply ta8645 5 hours agoparentprevTo add more idle speculation, I&#x27;d posit that a greater culprit is the continued shift toward thinking government should solve all problems. It has a corrosive, disempowering, and discouraging effect on people. Once it has such mind share, government intervention undermines every facet of a healthy society, contributing to the death of small independent business and increasing the concentration of wealth into fewer huge corporations that are protected from honest competition by legislative, judicial, and regulatory capture.Which all is cited as \"proof\" that the system doesn&#x27;t work, and more calls that government should do even more to \"solve\" it. And the death spiral continues. reply Ashken 4 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate on this? From what I can tell, the outcome that you’re speaking of has occurred for the opposite reason.Looking at the data for the US, there seems to be an even more exponential curve between 2015-2020, which would imply that these trends could have been further exacerbated by the reduction of government regulation. The same is likely true for the concentration of wealth, the loss in small businesses, disenfranchisement, etc. reply zerbinxx 2 hours agorootparentI think a possible explanation would be that the increasing desire for more government regulation, or at least functional government, runs counter to the world, which is increasingly ruled by inhuman, (even anti-human) forces. This breeds a desperation in people as they realize that humanity is viewed as a resource, not an end in itself, for the inhuman forces (call it capital, technology, whatever) to consume and mold toward their own ends. While the left is obviously more in favor of “big government”, I think it’s easy to forget that conservatives are also perpetually in rebellion against a government they feel has abandoned the goal of protecting the traditional structures they hold dear, while also delegating the role of speech police and moral authority to the dreaded socially liberal wings of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. reply elzbardico 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, if the Big Government was not so hellbent on helping making billionaires trillionaires at the expense of the working class, maybe the poor could learn to be more self-reliant.Pretty hard for a lot of people that doesn&#x27;t make multiple hundreds of thousands dollars an year to not depend on the government, when lax fiscal policies completely devalue their money while inflating the assets and the pockets of the oligarchic class.Get real, the oligarchs don&#x27;t want less government, they want less of the big goverment money going for other people than the oligarchs. Not a single one of them want free markets, not one of them wants fiscal discipline, not a single one of them want real free trade.They nurture crises for years so they can extract more when we cannot ignore the crisis anymore, and emergency measures are required. They have postponed the energy transition, their foundations and their grants helped to demonize nuclear when we desperately needed for it to evolve and expand. Now we are faced with an emergency, and we are pretending that nobody is going to make loads of money out of renewables, and that probably it is going to be the same people who made lots of money from oil. The bills will explode for the common folk, like they are doing in Europe, and in the end, if we escape deindustrialization, they will use the government to extract money from the people again to finally nuclearize our power generation.So, if we want to talk about big government, let&#x27;s talk about big government, but let&#x27;s be honest and admit that big government, big corporate and big finance are basically siamese twins. reply listenallyall 1 hour agorootparentfiscal policies in the US have been very far from \"lax\" -- they have been highly engineered via \"quantitative easing\" to artificially grow the economy (the debt, really) through massive money-printing and asset inflation programs.\"Lax\" policies would have avoided repeated and continuous intervention and let the chips fall where they may. reply poulpy123 11 minutes agorootparentprevif it was true we should see a downward trend in west european countries reply virgildotcodes 4 hours agorootparentprevThis reads like it was generated by Heritage Foundation GPT. reply hindsightbias 4 hours agorootparent“The era of big government is over.”— Bill Clinton, 1990 somethingWe’re still living in Reagan’s World and they still don’t get it. reply robotresearcher 3 hours agorootparentprevIs Scandinavia poor and miserable? reply refurb 2 hours agorootparentThey do seem rather miserable. reply MacsHeadroom 3 hours agorootparentprevScandinavia is ethnically homogenous. reply robotresearcher 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not really true, and what does that have to do with the parent&#x27;s assertions?Take Canada as an example then.

It took easily another 5 years before a significant amount of teenagers had them, especially outside the richest countries.But of course it&#x27;s not the technical capability that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s the always-online culture, the network effects, the constant doomscrolling through algorithm-optimized feeds, the instant notification when someone replies to your kneejerk vitrolic comment with even more vitrol.And then again, that culture was not possible without the technical capabilities and widespread adoption of them. Nobody was motivated to build a site or app optimized for doomscrolling until there were enough eyeballs and advertising dollars to capture. reply JohnMakin 2 hours agorootparentThen why does this trend disproportionately affect girls? There is nothing particular special about “onlineness” that should affect them particularly worse than boys, but plenty of very real evidence that shows social media sites like IG are very harmful to girls (and meta knows it).There are plenty of millennials that have been terminally online since at least their early teens and weren’t showing this same trend. I’m saying there’s nothing inherent about “online-ness” that should warrant mass levels of depression like this. reply AlecSchueler 45 minutes agorootparentWhy do you assert that onlineness doesn&#x27;t affect women disproportionately?Women face all sorts of abuse and minimization online. I&#x27;ve heard of many women using male sounding names online in order to be taken seriously or avoid harassment. The general advice on subreddits dominated by women is to turn off personaal messaging to avoid the inevitable rape threats.Take a look on Instagram and take a look at some musicians that are men and some that are women. The level of hatred directed towards women and the extra barriers they face will be very clear.You also have subreddits that glorify misogyny like WomenAreThings or MisogynyKink. You have others where guys steal pictures from girls&#x27; social medias and redistribute them with captions about rape fantasy or where they use AI to force their victims into sexual media.You look on YouTube and the algorithm wants to push misogynistic content aimed at disillusioned young boys and more and more of them are tuning in and blaming women for all their problems, asserting that feminism was a mistake.If you&#x27;re on Instagram compare how many women have their profiles set to private than men. This is to avoid the constant harassment they&#x27;d otherwise face.I&#x27;m seeing more research every year that suggests women are actively self-censoring, silencing themselves or pretending to be men when online.Here&#x27;s a few interesting bits of further reading.

The problem with these theories is that none of that stuff abruptly changed in the 2010s, and even then there&#x27;s no particular reason that a 13-year old girl would be so much more negatively impacted by changes that did occur than anyone else.Haidt&#x27;s theory focuses a lot on technological change like smartphones and social media (though it has some other components). Ten years ago this seemed believable because it appeared at that time that teen girls were more interested in these technologies than boys. However, the under-30 mental health problem is ongoing (and may even be accelerating), and yet it&#x27;s much less clear now that there is any gender difference in technology uptake.I haven&#x27;t seen a satisfying explanation from Haidt about the more recent data, and have come to believe that there is no adequate explanation right now. reply hackinthebochs 25 minutes agoparentSocial media created a perpetual church gossip culture where every action and statement is endlessly evaluated by the peanut gallery, while also creating a land rush for finding new moral angles to exploit for social status.

It will surely lock-in their freedom to do many stuff and they have nothing to do but to surf on the social media.This means although the children are less exposed to the external threats, they also have less experience to the outside world, which caused an asymmetric information flowing around in social media when they are surprised by some crazy act of their peers -- including flexing off with money, doing impossible stunts, and even pregnancy.Keep in mind what you see on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Tiktok are shared globally, that means a 12 years old lad from Texas could be seeing another 12 years old do some crazy stuff on SF, but what I want to say is about kids should be interacting with their local peers more than the global ones. This way you won&#x27;t taint the kids POV to be among the globals, or be the best of the best. Focus on the local community and parents should not be that paranoid to overprotect their children. If they need to get hurt, just let them get hurt in a controlled way. Just, let, them, be.Overprotectionism implies controlling freedom, and the lack of freedom means lack of innovation and reflections, and will easily create a death spiral, that one of them descend into mental illness, and eventually many other horrible things.Also, I think the core reason for any mental illness, at least from my own POV, is always about getting asymmetric information, which caused mental imbalances from within. But how do we get rid of asymmetric information or mental imbalances? No, I don&#x27;t think you can...but if you could accept this fact, and you would be free from the mental illness hell. reply grecy 5 hours agoprevDo teens have much to look forward to?Climate change is already causing severe weather events, which are very likely to ramp quickly.Careers are a thing of the past, and it seems like no matter how hard you work you&#x27;ll never \"get ahead\" and will be lucky not to spend your life living paycheck to paycheck.Life expectancy has gone down, markedly.Debt is up.New wars. reply bongodongobob 1 hour agoparentI think this has to be a huge chunk of it.

Way too much political, unsubstantiated and handwavy rhetoric from him. And his track record has been entirely unconvincing.The only reasonable way I can interpret his work is that of a ideologically driven puritan, trying to make the data fit his perception. In doing so, he often misses the forest for the trees.In particular, this interpretation of teenage mental illness is predicated on data. But the data sucks. Why should we assume we have accurate data on mental illness? It&#x27;s ridiculous when you consider our society&#x27;s terrible history in dealing with this stigma. Sexist notions like female hysteria, gross misuse of sedatives and psychoactive drugs by medical charlatans, repression of discussion about mental illness, bias&#x2F;inexperience&#x2F;abuse by governmental and health care institutions, horrible conditions at sanitoriums, the list goes on. Give it another 100 years and maybe we can draw some better patterns.In no particular order, here are some highlights on medical data and institutions in history...1. The consensus on normal heart rate is still erroneously assumed to be 60-100 bpm. For over 100 years, this myth was predicated on poor data and grossly misinterpreted literature. Our current, best consensus based on better data is 50-90 bpm, though virtually all textbooks and educational programs have failed to update themselves. If we can&#x27;t even get statistics on heart rates right, how are we supposed to get statistics on mental illness correct?2. There is no consensus on average breaths per minute. Textbooks often contradict themselves, quoting different fabricated ranges for respiratory rates within the same page. Data in this area is sparse and and lacks adjustment for demographics. The most comprehensive data is from a study done in 1846... We just don&#x27;t know because we haven&#x27;t put in the rigorous effort to definitively identify this range. Again, this basic measurement is much easier than mental illness, and we haven&#x27;t done it yet.3. The most established field of medicine is considered to be Obstetrics. That is to say, this is the medical field with the oldest depth of knowledge that we consider to be accurate or useful. Which makes sense given the significance of managing childbirth for societies. And yet there are still severe deficiencies in this field. We have a long way to go in the most mature field of medical science, and an even longer way to go in every other field. In comparison, mental health was not even mentioned in writing until 1946.4. Prior to the gross misuse of opioids perpetuated by the Sackler family, was the gross misuse of benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium). Prior was of Barbiturates. Prior to that was alcohol. And countless more medications in between those broad categories. Humanity has abused substances to numb itself from crippling anxiety for centuries, and in the modern sense has almost always sought to mass market these drugs before careful consideration of their appropriate use. Each medication was so abused that each generation has their own idioms and memes regarding their misuse.I&#x27;m certain that we can do better.

The big one... teens grew up with the Internet, and all the capitalist industries and images promoted on TikTok, Instagram, etc. It&#x27;s a race to the bottom with exploitation and fake online personas, similarly to how crypto tokens are in a race to the bottom with generating fake volume etc. Now you&#x27;re competing against the whole world.4. They see very little to look forward to, because of AI and automation depressing jobs. Their dads are probably on opiates while their moms are on antidepressants.

What&#x27;s to look forward to? reply AnarchismIsCool 4 hours agoprevI think all the social media stuff is missing the mark. It&#x27;s 100% bad but it&#x27;s just trash filling the hole society is making.Looking top down at the problem, humans need self actualization or propose to be happy. Originally we evolved to live in medium sized social groups that worked together to ensure their survival, we took care of each other and that was what drove our purpose, or rather why that need evolved, it helped increase the odds a group survived.Fast forward and we&#x27;re now trying to derive purpose out of pure competition. What percentile is your IQ, your GPA, your income, your stack rank. Society is becoming hyper competitive because that is what makes the most money. Nobody interacts with their local community, they interact with those that provide the best chance of making enough money to survive: coworkers, their \"network\", prospective employers.This is all great for perpetual exponential economic growth but not so great for humans. Instead of just being the best we can be for our community we&#x27;re trying to make them compete, keeping people switched on in survival mode 24&#x2F;7 to extract maximum profits. Instead of community we&#x27;re trying to create a nice plastic wrapped substitute with social media and phones, they&#x27;re not the cause, they&#x27;re the symptom. reply anon373839 3 hours agoparent> I think all the social media stuff is missing the mark.I think phones may well be responsible. Before smartphones, people regularly experienced true downtime - unstructured moments with nothing to do except be in your surroundings, feel your own boredom, experience your thoughts. Now, the moment our attention isn’t occupied by something external, we reach for our phones to have something to fill the silence.I believe this has negatively affected everyone’s mental health, but it stands to reason that children would be worse off because they’ve never known anything different: they’ve never had the opportunity to develop the ability to just be. reply wisty 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m going to say there&#x27;s at least four factors, all related to bad parenting, not that bad parenting is the only cause.The phone as a babysitter is a big one, but also parents on phones &#x2F; social media.There&#x27;s also an atomisation of society (fewer extended family and friends, and institutions like church groups).

What chance does the kid have? reply realpotatosalad 3 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn&#x27;t put phones as the responsible one so generally. I view phones as tool to &#x27;solve&#x27; specific problems, such as communication. Apps and websites such as Outlook (email apps with notifications in general), LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, maybe also Hackernews etc. pose more of the role of ruining our downtime, as they are designed that way.At the end it would probably be about the lack of media competency, not knowing which apps and sites want to keep you as long as possible on their sites and which sources could benefit you better mentally.And for children, aren&#x27;t we adults (& probably also young adults) responsible to teach them about what media is and how to detect the bad apples? reply anon-3988 1 hour agorootparent> I wouldn&#x27;t put phones as the responsible one so generally.From my experience, phone is an extremely common factor.

Before that the same argument had been made for books but newspapers were on another level - they were effectively limitless drugs, affordable and every single day a new one was available. Instead of talking, laughing and joking with the other workers waiting at the bus stop or in the canteen or whatever, instead you had a sea of silent men reading newspapers.I’m not convinced phones are without potential harm, but I’m hesitant to get too worked up about them vs. What’s gone before. reply Quekid5 2 hours agorootparentThe newspaper at least... stops once you&#x27;ve read it -- so that&#x27;s what an hour (or whatever) gone of your day.

Hope my kids don&#x27;t have to know what thats like.My point is not that smartphones and social media are great things. But I agree with OP that they are just filling a gap created by something else. It is still possible to be bored or have time solely with your own thoughts with social media available. Why? Because even kids can (and do) understand that social media is not all that great. Of course they have to experience that on their own before they understand it. It&#x27;s nothing that you can teach them. reply CraigJPerry 2 hours agorootparentprevToday you consider a phone to be infinitely distracting because you haven’t experienced yet the next engrossing medium, we put our phones in our pockets occasionally today but perhaps tomorrow we just won’t take our iQuest3 thingys off our faces between sunrise and bedtime.Someone will be well placed to make your argument - well at least you put your phone away at some point!The socially challenging bit is the difference not the magnitude I think. reply seoulmetro 2 hours agorootparentprevNo one was reading the newspaper for the entire day.

The coming changes focus on better authentication and email relevance, and pave the way for new mailbox standards that require senders everywhere to step up their game. PUBLISHED ON OCTOBER 05, 2023 As senders, we should be the first to care about sending valuable, relevant emails to our contacts. Ultimately, email’s efficiency as a communications channel depends on our recipients’ overall inbox experience. More unwanted emails mean more competition and less likelihood of having our messages read. But that doesn’t stop us from worrying when mailbox providers make changes to the way they handle unsolicited messages, like the ones announced earlier this month by Gmail and Yahoo. What do these changes really mean? How are they going to impact your email program? And most importantly, what do you need to do to stay on the right side of the email law? We’ve got all the answers and some recommendations in this post.

TABLE OF CONTENT 01 What have Gmail and Yahoo announced for 2024? 02 What do these changes mean for senders? 03 What do you need to do to prepare? 04 How can Sinch Mailgun help? RECENT ARTICLES Mailgun Optimize releases updates to monitor authentication success rates “Email failed to send” – understanding the error message? What’s coming for email in 2024 What have Gmail and Yahoo announced for 2024? In an ongoing effort to secure inboxes, both Gmail and Yahoo have said that they will be enforcing new protection standards for bulk email senders. Gmail, who had already announced a cleanup of inactive accounts in May 2023, explained in a statement that enforcement will begin in February 2024, and they’ll be carefully monitoring senders transmitting more than 5000 messages a day. In a very similar announcement, Yahoo explained that they’ll also be targeting the first quarter of 2024. “Many bulk senders don’t appropriately secure and configure their systems, allowing attackers to easily hide in their midst.” Neil Kumaran, Group Product Manager, Gmail Security & Trust These upcoming standards are probably the most substantial we’ve seen a mailbox provider implement in recent years, but they’re not new. In fact, authentication, easy opt-out, and spam monitoring have been high on the list of email deliverability best practices for quite some time now. And while it’s no surprise it has caused some concern among senders, at Sinch Mailgun we suspect requirements like these will soon spread across the industry. What do these changes mean for senders? The most straight forward answer to this question is that, if you haven’t already, you’ll need to get serious about certain email deliverability best practices. Both Gmail and Yahoo have highlighted three key changes that senders will need to prioritize if they want to be seen as legitimate senders come 2024: Authenticate their email: Senders will be required to verify their sender identities with standard protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Enable easy unsubscription: Senders will need to implement a single-click unsubscribe link within emails if they haven’t already, to allow recipients to easily opt out. Only send emails users want: Gmail and Yahoo are getting serious about spam monitoring and senders will need to ensure they’re keeping below a set spam rate threshold. These mandates will only affect bulk senders, defined by Google as senders with volumes of 5000 or more messages to Gmail addresses in one day. The announcements don’t specify that a sender must send 5000 messages each day, or within a certain time frame, though. So, it’s important to consider your peak holiday sending habits, and large campaigns when checking if these rules will apply to you. You may not think of yourself as a bulk sender, but mailbox providers might disagree. As we mentioned before, these requirements are not unexpected or revolutionary changes in the way we should be sending emails, but they’re still not followed by many senders. For example, email authentication has been strongly encouraged for a number of years now. Still, our State of email deliverability report found that around 40% of senders are either unsure or not implementing both SPF and DKIM, and among those using DMARC, 40% are not sure what their policy is. “These changes are like a tune-up for the email world, and by fixing a few things under the hood, we can keep email running smoothly. But just like a tune-up, this is not a one-time exercise. Keeping email more secure, user friendly and spam-free requires constant collaboration and vigilance from the entire email community.” Neil Kumaran Group Product Manager, Gmail Security & Trust The good news is that both providers have highlighted similar updates in their statements, primarily focused on maintaining higher standards of authentication, simplifying unsubscription from commercial emails, and holding senders under a lower spam rate threshold. Here’s a snapshot of what to expect. What do you need to do to prepare? So, the ball is now on the email sender’s court to get ready before 2024. What changes do you need to make to ensure your emails keep landing in the inbox? And how do you implement them? Here’s a detailed list: Get serious about email authentication Email authentication is the process of securing and confirming your sender identity through certificates and encryption. The Gmail and Yahoo updates focus on validating your sender identity. In 2022, Gmail began to require that senders adopt some form of authentication, which resulted in a 75% drop in unauthenticated messages received by Gmail users. But complex problems like spammers, phishers, and malware require equally complex solutions. Gmail’s first task for bulk senders is that they authenticate their email by following these best practices. The requirement from both Gmail and Yahoo is to set up strong authentication with “SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your domain.” Previously not a requirement, this move towards implementing DMARC is something Sinch Mailgun’s Jonathan Torres had already predicted in our guide on email security and compliance. “At some point, mailbox providers may decide to prioritize messages from senders that have DMARC policies set to reject or quarantine, because those are the ones they can verify and trust. We haven’t seen anyone take that step yet, but the groundwork is there to require senders to have a DMARC policy set to something besides p=none. That might be what it takes for adoption.” Jonathan Torres, TAM Team Manager, Mailgun Our recommendation is to set up both SPF and DKIM as the bare minimum to protect your sender identity and your deliverability and start taking steps towards DMARC authentication. Here’s how to go about it. New email authentication requirements What­ you’­ll need­ How to get ther­e Gm­ail: Both­ SPF and DKIM­ are requ­ired by Gmai­l. Mess­ages that­ don’­t carr­y thes­e prot­ocols will­ be reje­cted from­ the inbo­x or mark­ed as spam­. DMAR­C is also­ requ­ired to prev­ent Gmai­l impe­rsonation in FROM­ head­ers.

But if you’­re not we’v­e outl­ined the proc­esses for obta­ining thes­e auth­entications in thes­e post­s: SPF­ basi­cs and Und­erstanding DKIM­.

Get star­ted now by chec­king out our Imp­lementing DMAR­C arti­cle. Make it easy for your recipients to unsubscribe There were already good reasons to provide an easy opt out for contacts: Sending messages to users who don’t want them has a major negative impact on your engagement metrics and spam rates and is ultimately bad for your overall reputation. Now, unsubscribe links will be even more important. From 2024, both Gmail and Yahoo will require that senders provide a single-click process for users to unsubscribe, as opposed to confirming your email or updating your subscription preferences and providing feedback. Senders will have two days to implement unsubscribe requests. New unsubscribe requirements What­ you’­ll need­ How to get ther­e Sa­me for Gmai­l and Yaho­o: A sing­le-click path­way for user­s to easi­ly unsu­bscribe from­ your­ mess­ages and inte­rnal supp­ort to hono­r unsu­bscribe requ­ests with­in 2 days­. Add an uns­ubscribe link­ at the top or bott­om of your­ emai­ls that­ prov­ides cont­acts with­ a sing­le-click opt out path­way. Carefully monitor spam rates What’s the best way to eliminate spam from user’s inboxes? Create a low spam rate threshold that senders won’t be able to exceed. The strategy for both Yahoo and Gmail is the same, though we don’t currently have that threshold limit defined in either of their statements. “We will start enforcing a threshold to ensure our users can continue to enjoy a spam free mailbox.” Marcel Becker, Sr Director Product Management at Yahoo Your spam rate, or spam complaint rate, is the number of recipients that report your message as spam compared to the total number of emails that were delivered. The best way to keep this number low is to monitor, sunset disengaged subscribers before they are tempted to press the spam button, and promptly respond to any spike in your spam complaint rate by cleaning your list and reviewing your sending practices. Remember, Gmail doesn’t provide traditional feedback loops like Yahoo does, so you’ll need to ensure you’re signed up with Google Postmasters Tools to monitor your spam rates. What­ you’­ll need­ How to get ther­e Sa­me for Gmai­l and Yaho­o: Thre­sholds are not yet list­ed, but send­ers will­ be requ­ired to keep­ thei­r spam­ rate­s belo­w a cert­ain perc­entage.

In fact, any kind of rate-limiting is ineffective here, especially for smaller organisations, because you only need to generate a small fraction of the traffic they normally send out.

It’s still very common to have unsubscribe links that require you to enter your email address and then select that you actually want to unsubscribe from everything, etc. And some of them still require logins, although those are getting rarer. Not sure if it’s actually a loophole, but one of the dark patterns I’m seeing often is one-click unsubscribe generally only unsubscribes you from a very specific type of notification or topic of the mailing list, and you’ll still get other types of emails unless you fully log into your account and go in your email settings and unsubscribe from everything. Not sure exactly how Google and Yahoo treat those, but it feels kind of like marketers found a loophole that seems to work for them. reply thayne 2 hours agorootparentI also get a fair number where there is am unsubscribe link, but it doesn&#x27;t work.

For example, every day you send 2,500 messages from solarmora.com and 2,500 messages from promotions.solarmora.com to personal Gmail accounts. You’re considered a bulk sender because all 5,000 messages were sent from the same primary domain: solarmora.com.

Without DKIM, one can easily do \"EHLO randomspamdomainboughtyesterday.com\" and \"From: accounts@citibank.com\". SPF is about the transport, DKIM is about the content.And to round it out, DMARC tells the receiver what to do when the SPF or DKIM tests fail, namely \"report\", \"quarantine\", or \"reject\". Not sure why they&#x27;re requiring it when it doesn&#x27;t affect a spam verdict.

    "originBody": "Linux 6.8 Network Optimizations Can Boost TCP Performance For Many Concurrent Connections By ~40% Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Networking on 9 January 2024 at 02:23 PM EST. 20 Comments Beyond the usual new wired/wireless network hardware support and the other routine churn in the big Linux networking subsystem, the Linux 6.8 kernel is bringing some key improvements to the core networking code that can yield up to a ~40% improvement for TCP performance when encountering many concurrent network connections. First up, there's been an analysis and reorganization of core networking structures. This effort has been around optimizing cacheline consumption and adding safeguards to ensure future changes don't regress. In turn this optimizing of core networking structures is causing TCP performance with many concurrent connections to increase by as much as 40% or more! Coco Li of Google explained of their cachline optimization effort to the networking code: \"Currently, variable-heavy structs in the networking stack is organized chronologically, logically and sometimes by cache line access. This patch series attempts to reorganize the core networking stack variables to minimize cacheline consumption during the phase of data transfer. Specifically, we looked at the TCP/IP stack and the fast path definition in TCP.\" Their results are mighty impressive for being done to the core networking code: A hell of an improvement especially for the AMD EPYC servers. Kudos to those at Google continuing to push these very enticing low-level kernel optimizations. Meanwhile new Ethernet driver hardware support in Linux 6.8 includes the Octeon CN10K devices, Broadcom 5760X P7, Qualcomm SM8550 SoC, and Texas Instrument DP83TG720S PHY. On the Bluetooth side is new driver support for the IMC Networks Bluetooth radio. As we've seen recently with efforts to drop old/obsolete network drivers, several outdated WiFi drivers were removed for Linux 6.8. Newly-dropped Wifi support include Libertas 16-bit PCMCIA support, Atmel at76c50x drivers, HostAP ISA/PCMCIA style 802.11b driver, zd1201 802.11b USB dongles, Orinoco ISA/PCMCIA 802.11b driver, Aviator/Raytheon driver, Planet WL3501 driver, and the RNDIS USB 802.11b driver. When it comes to network driver improvements in Linux 6.8, the Intel high-speed NIC driver has added support for temperature and clock information reporting, among other random improvements throughout the many network drivers. NVIDIA Mellanox Ethernet data center switches can also now enjoy firmware updates without a reboot. On the WiFi side there remains ongoing WiFi 7 work and Extremely High Throughput (EHT) improvements. The full list of new networking patches for the Linux 6.8 kernel merge window can be found via today's pull request. 20 Comments",

I told all of my friends about this contract and discussed it publicly many times, including to 100,000+ podcast listeners. The stakes of the bet? If I failed, I would send $9,999, the maximum amount allowed by StickK, to a so-called \"anti-charity\" whose cause I didn't support. Spoiler: I succeeded with about an hour left in the year and zero gas left in the tank. I'd even found a free day to whip together an AI-based book trailer after finishing the first draft. But here's what you need to know: even though I was confident I would pull through on the contract, there was simply no clear path to victory at the time that I signed it: I hadn't written a word of fiction in almost 10 years. I'm a good writer, but I've historically been a slow writer. I run a business which requires a lot of my time, energy, and attention. How, then, was I so confident I would succeed? Plan, Do, Learn \"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.\" —Bruce Lee I was confident because I've spent years mastering a simple iteration process — the plan, do, learn loop — which helps me innovate and course-correct toward just about any goal, provided I'm given a reasonable time frame. I encourage you to go read that old post if you haven't, but tl;dr: I make a plan, then do the plan, then learn from my efforts by reviewing my progress. I do this every day of the year, going on half a decade now. These plan, do, learn loops (\"PDL loops\" for short) exist at six nested levels: Quarters Months Weeks Days Sessions: multiple per day, lasting ~3 hours each and broken up by 60-minute breaks Actions: multiple per session, lasting anywhere from 5–60 minutes each If it sounds simple, it is. And it isn't. Throw a kick 10,000 times and you'll find lots of nuance. My original post hinted at my iteration speed but said little about my iteration strategy. That is, I didn't explain how I plan, how I do, or how I learn. Better late than never. In this post, I'll talk about 20% of the factors that lead to 80% of my outcomes. They're captured in the following acronyms: AIM: Plan FIRE: Do SCAN: Learn Each of the concepts deserves its own standalone post, so I'm going to try to keep things short and sweet from here. AIM: The 80/20 of Good Planning AIM stands for ABZs, Interrogate, and Mandatory. 1. ABZs: This gem is from Shaan Puri: Too many people get caught up in the HOW. \"How do I go from A to B to C to D to E etc.\" All you need is the ABZ: A = where are you now B = next small step Z = end vision 2. Interrogate: Suppose you've already made an iteration through the loop and now you're reviewing your original plan. Rather than thoughtlessly continuing down that original path, interrogate the plan and confirm that it still makes sense. At one point while writing my novel, I reflexively started working on a new chapter because I'd included it in the original outlining process. But interrogation helped me realize that it was no longer needed, which literally saved me weeks of wasted effort. Heed Peter Drucker: After completing the original top-priority task, the executive resets priorities rather than moving on to number two from the original list. He asks, “What must be done now?” This generally results in new and different priorities. 3. Mandatory: Identify a mandatory, must-ship objective for the work iteration, and commit to shipping it regardless of the obstacles you encounter. If you can't think of a concrete objective, make it a time commitment like \"contribute 5 on-task hours to my novel this week.\" I've personally found it really effective to give myself a \"day must-ship objective\" and a \"week must-ship objective.\" A few months into my StickK contract I even started taking out $50 \"mini-contracts\" to hold myself accountable to my week must-ship objectives. FIRE: The 80/20 of Good Doing FIRE stands for Frontload, Improvise, Resourcefulness, and Exhaust. 1. Frontload: Mark Twain said it best: If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first. To repeat what I've written elsewhere, long-term optimism for difficult projects is made out of short-term pessimism. Wake up assuming everything will go wrong today. This week. This month. And execute accordingly. If things do go wrong, you'll still be on track. If they don't, you'll be way ahead. 2. Improvise: Speaking of things going wrong: they will. And when they do, you'll be happy you followed the ABZ framework and didn't overplan. I use all sorts of techniques for improvising and getting unstuck. Here are just a few of them: The BUS method: freewrite ideas, then organize them interstitial journaling: journal as you work through tasks rubberducking: explain the problem you're trying to solve to an inanimate object Note: there's a huge difference between improvising on the iteration path and improvising on the iteration itself. Using the ABZ framework, a legitimate improvisation might be rethinking how to achieve B, but it will almost never be rethinking B itself. As a rule with few exceptions, you want to move forward through iteration loops, not backward. (Too often, moving backward is a sign of problems with doing, not problems with planning.) 3. Resourcefulness: Human brains suck at most things. Instead of relying only on mental resources like willpower and memory, use extra-mental resources for added leverage. This is a book-length topic and perhaps the main secret of my success, so forgive me the vagueness of simply bucketing extra-mental resources into two categories and leaving it at that for now: 1) The Three Me's and 2) The Two We's: The Three Me's: Techniques, e.g. the BUS method Tools, e.g. standard operating procedures, ChatGPT Territories, i.e. environmental constraints on your behavior, e.g. putting your phone on DND mode The Two We's: Teachers, e.g. books, mentors, content creators Teams, e.g. personal assistants 4. Exhaust: Don't take the \"exhaust\" term too literally here. Burnout is real, and I'm not suggesting you should do that. Instead I mean that if you decide to do an hour of work, try to work a 60-minute hour rather than, say, a 30-minute hour filled with continuous partial attention. Easy to do when you're passionate or things are going well. Less easy when you're stuck or bored, and discipline is required. Enforced time constraints work wonders here. My own convention is to do intensive work sessions for set blocks of time then self-impose 30- to 60-minute cooldown periods where I relax and recharge. I use a website blocker called Freedom for this. I did a deep-dive on this process here. Performance Design is where I share ~1 essay a month on building a flywheel of personal growth.

Subscribe Or go here for my other series, where I publish more frequently. SCAN: The 80/20 of Good Learning SCAN stands for Score, Critique, Adjust, and Notes. 1. Score: Scoring helps you measure your performance objectively. If you don't do it, you end up lying to yourself without knowing you're lying to yourself. Again, heed Drucker: One company chairman was absolutely certain that he divided his time roughly into three parts. One third he thought he was spending with his senior men. One third he thought he spent with his important customers. And one third he thought was devoted to community activities. The actual record of his activities over six weeks brought out clearly that he spent almost no time in any of these areas. These were the tasks on which he knew he should spend time — and therefore memory, obliging as usual, told him that these were the tasks on which he actually had spent his time. I like to score (or at least track) two things: inputs and outputs. By inputs, I really just mean time: \"How many hours did I put in versus the amount of hours I was supposed to put in?\" Outputs is more self-explanatory: \"Did I ship my must-ship objective?\" Both can be scored with a simple 0 or 1. (My personal scoring systems have become a lot more sophisticated after years of iteration, but I started with something like this.) 2. Critique: If you take the time to look, you will always, always, always identify at least one flaw in your performance that can improve upon. But if you don't look, that flaw will often go unnoticed for many iterations, or even forever. What I do is identify at least one of these flaws at the end of each iteration cycle. 3. Adjust: It's not enough to notice a flaw. You also want to take action. And in my experience, simply saying, \"Okay, next time I won't do [flaw]\" is bullshit 90% of the time. One of my bad habits early on in the process of working on the novel was putting other work in front of it: answering work emails, chatting with my team, doing morning routine tasks, etc. By the time I got around to writing — which requires an enormous amount of mental energy — I was often drained. So I made an adjustment: within 30 minutes of waking up, I needed to get started on the manuscript and knock out at least 2 hours of work before opening the pandora's box of digital distractions. 4. Notes: Write down how things went during this iteration, and why. Benjamin Franklin began each day by asking himself in his journal: “What good shall I do this day?” Then, at the end of the day, he'd ask “What good have I done today?” If it's good enough for Big Ben, it's good enough for you. The first reason why documenting your progress is good is because it leaves a record for you to investigate later. You'll be less likely to make the same mistakes over again without being able to lie to yourself about it. The second reason why this is good is because writing is thinking. Often, the act of writing your learnings from the iteration will lead to far greater clarity about your performance than you could gain otherwise. It's similar to the process of rubberducking. By the way, I'm thinking of sharing updates on the book publishing process. If that kind of thing interests you, follow along here.

And I space out sessions. reply metabeard 9 hours agorootparentprev> DDR cabDance Dance Revolution? reply dvno42 9 hours agorootparentYes. Cab being Cabinet, slang for an arcade setup of Dance Dance Revolution as opposed to the home version. I&#x27;m with you GP, DDR&#x2F;ITG dedicabs have always been a way to get me out of a rut. reply candiddevmike 8 hours agorootparentprevStepmania is an option along with some USB pads. Works well on Linux. reply chaosharmonic 7 hours agorootparentStepmania is great. I actually built a skeleton of a workout tracker for DDR a while back using the simfiles I was already playing this on. I haven&#x27;t had a space to play in that consistently in years, though, so I never bothered to bring the hosted demo back up when Heroku killed their free tier and kinda stalled the development before it got more than just fleshed out enough to be kind of useful.That said, there&#x27;s a mostly working .sm to .ssc converter (it&#x27;s still got a couple edge cases around punctuation in titles), as I had to migrate the simfiles to something with named properties anyway to get reliable data out of them.This, and the seeder script (which I wrote using a bunch of fetch requests in order to also test a bunch of my frontend logic, before Node started shipping with that) that I used to seed all the DDR arcade tracks into a db, were actually my first experience with Deno. It&#x27;s been my go-to experiment tool pretty much ever since.If anyone&#x27;s curious, it&#x27;s under my github (same username) at step-step-recollection. (And ...recollection-scripts, and ...recollection-ui. Annoyingly I never got to experimenting with server-side rendering on it, so that&#x27;s also a separate repo.) reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agoparentprev> 5. Habits are very powerful. Your brush your teeth, right?You&#x27;d be surprised. For some, brushing teeth is an explicit act of will every day, that never seems to habituate. ADHD perhaps? reply cpursley 10 hours agoparentprev> Going to the gym is not funHard stuff is not until it becomes a habit. Then you begin to enjoy the details of it and get in the zone.Great points! reply mcmoor 7 hours agoparentprevI still don&#x27;t find habit useful, at least as I interpret it as something magical that reduces pain of something you do often. If anything, pain of something I do get worse and worse the more I do it. Anything I do regularly is always because of external pressure, without that my \"habit\" just vanishes. reply ChanningAllen 11 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m a big fan of all 5!

Tony Robbins just made an appearance on Theo Von&#x27;s podcast, This Past Weekend. I haven&#x27;t watched it yet, but Theo is fantastic at getting his guests to open up. I am deeply skeptical of Tony Robbins overall, but I&#x27;ll probably queue up the podcast soon. reply waprin 7 hours agoprevAlways great to see indie hackers content.Since Channing mentions interstitial journaling, I want to share my interstitial journaling app called Interstitch at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Interstitch.appI shared it here on HN and PH and got 2 upvotes and zero people checking it out. But I realized half the problem is most people don’t know what interstitial journaling is. Many people understandly confuse it for a journaling app. But it’s closer to a time tracking app but more for individual performance than invoicing. But I assumed I was the only person who finds this useful, which was ok since I’ve been using it to set “deep work” daily goals and summarize how I spent my week so at least I use it.Then the CEO of Medium somehow sees the HN post and emails me that he coined the term, but I probably heard it from Ness Labs founder that Channing links to. So then I email her and she adds me to her newsletter which has like 100k subscribers and about 100 people are now using it which is cool. Good lesson in reaching the right audience. reply computersuck 10 minutes agoprevOvercomplicated reply DeathArrow 2 hours agoprevWhy complicate things?

(Too often, moving backward is a sign of problems with doing, not problems with planning.)\"What does that mean? a short example here would help. How do I know if reprioritizing is going backwards or a problem of doing vs. what was advised up above? reply Leo_Germond 4 hours agoparentI guess it means for some \"plan do check act\" loop, you want to avoid doing a plan, a do, then to plan again (because you have something important to note), then do a bit etc... This kind of back and forth were you subvert the principle by turning the loop into a 2 step pseudo-iteration. reply zubairq 2 hours agoprevI always think of these loops too.
