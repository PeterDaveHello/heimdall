    "hn_content": "Amazon has subpoenaed a blogger who criticized their policies, and is asking for additional information beyond the California AG requests. The blogger is not being sued and has been served with a subpoena, and the discovery process can be overwhelming and harassing for third parties. Responding to a subpoena is not an admission of guilt, and it is acceptable to reply that one does not have the documents requested. While lawyers do not need to put a disclaimer that their opinions are not legal advice, it is done out of caution to prevent liability. A Motion to Quash the Subpoena can be filed by the blogger's lawyer to deny or limit the scope of the subpoena, but the most common argument is \"unduly broad and burdensome.\"Amazon filed to quash a deposition subpoena made against them by Stephen Molson, the Chairman of an IP enforcement firm who is acting as an expert witness in a lawsuit filed against Amazon by the California Attorney General. However, it looks like the judge has already limited the overall scope of the subpoena. Molson reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of document requests he is receiving as part of the discovery process. While Molson is being cited in the complaint filed by the Attorney General, California did not engage him as an expert witness, and it does not appear that he is being paid for his time in this capacity. Third parties can require reasonable compensation for complying with discovery requests. Amazon is requesting documents and discovery from Molson that only he can provide.Amazon is accused of taking advantage of the legal process to silence a critic and using overly burdensome discovery requests to discredit him. The person in question is a fact witness for the State of California's lawsuit against Amazon and the discovery request is a part of that process, although Amazon has also named him as a party to a separate lawsuit. The person is not being sued directly but has been subpoenaed to produce documents. The discussion touches upon the nuances of legal proceedings, third-party discovery, and the impact on people who speak out against corporations. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has an ongoing investigation into similar issues with Amazon's business practices.Amazon is facing backlash over a lawsuit it has filed against an expert witness in the State of California's legal battle against the e-commerce giant. Amazon subpoenaed Dwayne Spradlin for all his personal and business records, contending that the documents will show that his criticisms of its supplier practices are baseless. Spradlin had been named an expert witness by the California AG but says he was not warned he would be subpoenaed. Amazon's move has been criticised for being a form of silencing critics and experts. The case has also highlighted Amazon's third-party seller policies and whether these effectively hamper such sellers' ability to compete outside the platform.Amazon is requesting documents from a witness in a lawsuit against them filed by the state of California, who cited the witness as supporting their case. The witness is claiming that Amazon's policies of not allowing sellers to price their products for less off-Amazon drives prices up elsewhere, hence why he testified against Amazon to Congress. The issue is complicated by the vagueness of anti-competitive laws that make it difficult to determine what is legal or not. The witness is complaining about the high legal fees incurred as a result of Amazon\u2019s discovery requests, but the situation is not necessarily unfair or unreasonable. The US legal system tends to favor those who can spend the most money. Amazon's policy can be seen either as a way of keeping prices low on Amazon or driving them up elsewhere, and some believe it is possible for Amazon to ban sellers who sell products for less elsewhere.- Amazon's policy of preventing sellers from charging lower prices off-Amazon results in sellers making less from Amazon sales and more from sales on their own sites.\n- Consumers essentially pay for Amazon, regardless of whether they use it or not.\n- Amazon's advantage in its logistics network means that cost + shipping is a calculation that Amazon will always win, making it cheaper than competitors.\n- Amazon's policies may not be uniquely onerous, but it has a de facto monopoly on e-commerce, incentivizing sellers to have their products on the platform.\n- The Twitter user who made claims against Amazon is not being sued for defamation, as opinions are not illegal. The burden of proof would be on the person making the claim if made in court.",
    "hn_summary": "- Amazon has subpoenaed critics and expert witnesses in a legal battle with the state of California, requesting personal and business documents.\n- The discovery process can be overwhelming and costly for third-party witnesses, who can file a Motion to Quash subpoena to limit scope.\n- The case highlights Amazon's third-party seller policies and their effects on competition, with ongoing investigations in the UK."

    "content": "ESPA\u00d1OLWith United States v. Smith (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2023), a district court judge in New York made history by being the first court to rule that a warrant is required for a cell phone search at the border, \u201cabsent exigent circumstances\u201d (although other district courts have wanted to do so).EFF is thrilled about this decision, given that we have been advocating for a warrant for border searches of electronic devices in the courts and Congress for nearly a decade. If the case is appealed to the Second Circuit, we urge the appellate court to affirm this landmark decision.The Border Search Exception as Applied to Physical Items Has a Long HistoryU.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) asserts broad authority to conduct warrantless, and often suspicionless, device searches at the border, which includes ports of entry at the land borders, international airports, and seaports.For a century, the Supreme Court has recognized a border search exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, allowing not only warrantless but also often suspicionless searches of luggage and other items crossing the border.The number of warrantless device searches at the border and the significant invasion of privacy they represent is only increasing. In Fiscal Year 2022, CBP conducted an all-time high of 45,499 device searches.The Supreme Court has not yet considered the application of the border search exception to smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices that contain the equivalent of millions of pages of information detailing the most intimate details of our lives\u2014even though we asked them to back in 2021.Circuit Courts Have Narrowed the Border Search Exception\u2019s Application to Digital DataFederal appellate courts, however, have considered this question and circumscribed CBP\u2019s authority.The Ninth Circuit in United States v. Cano (2019) held that a warrant is required for a device search at the border that seeks data other than \u201cdigital contraband\u201d such as child pornography. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Aigbekaen (2019) held that a warrant is required for a forensic device search at the border in support of a domestic criminal investigation.These courts and the Smith court were informed by Riley v. California (2014). In that watershed case, the Supreme Court held that the police must get a warrant to search an arrestee\u2019s cell phone.The Smith Court Rightly Applied the Riley Balancing TestIn our advocacy, we have consistently argued that Riley\u2019s analytical framework should inform whether the border search exception applies to cell phones and other electronic devices. This is precisely what the Smith court did: \u201cIn holding that warrants are required for cell phone searches at the border, the Court believes it is applying in straightforward fashion the logic and analysis of Riley to the border context.\u201dIn Riley, the Supreme Court applied a balancing test, weighing the government\u2019s interests in warrantless and suspicionless access to cell phone data following an arrest, against an arrestee\u2019s privacy interests in the depth and breadth of personal information stored on modern cell phones.In analyzing the government\u2019s interests, the Riley Court considered the traditional reasons for authorizing warrantless searches of an arrestee\u2019s person: to protect officers from an arrestee who might use a weapon against them, and to prevent the destruction of evidence.The Riley Court found only a weak nexus between digital data and these traditional reasons for warrantless searches of arrestees. The Court reasoned that \u201cdata on the phone can endanger no one,\u201d and the probability is small that associates of the arrestee will remotely delete digital data.The Riley Court also detailed how modern cell phones can in fact reveal the \u201csum of an individual\u2019s private life,\u201d and thus individuals have significant and unprecedented privacy interests in their cell phone data.On balance, the Riley Court held that the traditional search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement does not apply to cell phones.The Smith court properly applied the Riley balancing test in the border context, noting that travelers\u2019 privacy interests in their digital data are also significant:Just as in Riley, the cell phone likely contains huge quantities of highly sensitive information\u2014including copies of that person\u2019s past communications, records of their physical movements, potential transaction histories, Internet browsing histories, medical details, and more \u2026 No traveler would reasonably expect to forfeit privacy interests in all this simply by carrying a cell phone when returning home from an international trip.In analyzing the government\u2019s interests in gaining warrantless access to cell phone data at the border, the Smith court considered the traditional justifications for the border search exception: in the words of the judge, \u201cpreventing unwanted persons or items from entering the country.\u201d In particular, the government has a strong interest in conducting warrantless searches of luggage and other containers to identify goods subject to customs duty (import tax) and items considered contraband or that would otherwise be harmful if brought into the country such as drugs or weapons.Considering these traditional rationales for the border search exception in the context of modern cell phones, the Smith court concluded that the government\u2019s \u201cinterest in searching the digital data \u2018contained\u2019 on a particular physical device located at the border is relatively weak.\u201dThe court focused on the internet and cloud storage, stating: \u201cStopping the cell phone from entering the country would not \u2026 mean stopping the data contained on it from entering the country\u201d because any data that can be found on a cell phone\u2014even digital contraband\u2014\u201cvery likely does exist not just on the phone device itself, but also on faraway computer servers potentially located within the country.\u201d This is different from physical items that if searched without a warrant may be efficiently interdicted, and thereby actually prevented from entering the country.The Smith court further explained: To be sure, that data may contain information relevant to the Government\u2019s determination as to whether a person should be allowed entry, but the Government has little heightened interest in blocking entry of the information itself, which is the historical basis for the border search exception.Thus, the Smith court concluded: Because the government\u2019s interests in a warrantless search of a cell phone\u2019s data are thus much weaker than its interests in warrantless searches of physical items, and a traveler\u2019s privacy interests in her cell phone\u2019s data are much stronger than her privacy interests in her baggage, the Court concludes that the same balancing test that yields the border search exception cannot support its extension to warrantless cell phone searches at the border.EFF\u2019s Work Is Making a DifferenceThe Smith court\u2019s application of Riley\u2019s balancing test is nearly identical to the arguments we\u2019ve made time and time again.The Smith court also cited Cano, in which the Ninth Circuit engaged extensively with EFF\u2019s amicus brief even though it didn\u2019t go as far as requiring a warrant in all cases. The Smith court acknowledged that no federal appellate court \u201chas gone quite this far (although the Ninth Circuit has come close).\u201dWe\u2019re pleased that our arguments are moving through the federal judiciary and finally being embraced. We hope that the Second Circuit affirms this decision and that other courts\u2014including the Supreme Court\u2014are courageous enough to follow suit and protect personal privacy.",
    "summary": "- A district court judge in New York has ruled that a warrant is required for a cell phone search at the border, \"absent exigent circumstances\".\n- This decision is historic and is a significant win for EFF, who have been advocating for a warrant for border searches of electronic devices for nearly a decade.\n- The Supreme Court has not yet considered the application of the border search exception to smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices that contain the equivalent of millions of pages of information detailing the most intimate details of our lives.",

    "hn_content": "A federal judge has ruled that border searches of cell phones require a warrant. This decision has implications for national security since compromised phones can lead to potential risks for major corporations. The ruling also sets a precedent for reciprocity and protects the Fourth Amendment rights of US citizens. Some argue that unchecked discretionary power of border agents is a violation of rule of law, and the 100-mile border zone of the US raises constitutional questions. Security experts remind users not to carry their life around on their phones, as anything done on a phone is inherently less secure. The current phone industry is criticized for soldering on memory, which impedes users' ability to swap out components.The US government has reinstated net neutrality rules which ban broadband providers from slowing down web traffic or charging more for faster delivery speeds. The Federal Communications Commission's decision overturns a previous administration's move to repeal the rules in 2017. The impact of the move on innovation, investment and competition in the telecoms industry remains to be seen.The comments section of an article discussing the Electronic Frontier Foundation's (EFF) court case against the U.S. government over warrantless electronic device searches at the U.S. border. Many are appalled by these invasive searches and argue that citizenship should provide protection, but the government's inclination to ignore laws suggests that people should not rely on this protection. A border guard checkpoint confirms that entering as a Canadian citizen would be safer since the guard must let you in if you are Canadian. On a different note, people who think they can use gray areas in the law to deny identification when legally required at border checkpoints can face delays or even denial of entry.The Supreme Court rules that police need a warrant to search your phone when you are arrested. The exception is the border search where law enforcement officers can search your device without a warrant within 100 miles of any US border. The case was based on two separate incidents in California and Massachusetts where police found evidence of criminal activity on the smartphones of arrestees without warrants. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called it a \"major victory for privacy rights,\" while the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called the ruling \"a timely reminder of the importance of Fourth Amendment protections for all.\" It is unclear whether the ruling will affect searches of laptops and other electronic devices.The US Supreme court has ruled that border agents need to obtain a warrant before searching travelers' mobile phones, citing citizens' Fourth Amendment rights. The case centered around agents searching a man's mobile phone without a warrant after he crossed the border from Mexico. However, the Supreme Court did not review the wider question of searches on non-citizens or legal residents. The ruling now clarifies that travelers' mobile phones, which may hold vast amounts of personal data, are protected by constitutional privacy rights. Border authorities will be required to show justifiable reason for searches, thereby reducing arbitrary searches.- The post discusses the \"constitutional-free zone\" in the USA, where law enforcement has significant powers without proper legal limitations.\n- The Supreme Court has yet to review the application of the border search exception to electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.\n- There is a need to find additional ways to create standing in courts to challenge constitutionally contradictory laws and policies.\n- The current legal system allows such laws to remain in the books for decades until the right person challenges them.\n- The post suggests taking a cue from other countries where the President can evaluate laws' constitutionality as an additional option to vetoing or signing them.",

    "hn_content": "JMAP has allowed Easy integration of Masked Emails, according to a post by mkenyon at Hacker News. While the use of masked email has been hindered due to the difficulty of remembering which email address was assigned to which company, FastMail revealed they have an already-existing workaround to users' struggles. For instance, users can add masked emails, called \"sending identities\" in Fastmail. The parent poster suggested that supplying the masked email autocomplete dropdown with the company domain tag would be a better solution. Others recommended using catch-all aliasing and sift out the offenders.The comments section discusses the effectiveness of FastMail's spam filtering and provides tips on how to use it effectively. There is also a comparison of FastMail's pricing to other email services and recommendations for alternatives. Overall, the post provides insight into email service options and how to optimize spam filtering.FastMail is a fully independent email service with no outside debt. The company is self-funded by its customers and has been in business for 24 years. The company offers paid services for email and is not a startup. FastMail is a beloved company among HN readers. The email service supports features like catch-all email addresses, global forwarding rules, and wildcard email addresses for domains. FastMail also supports comments and tags within email addresses. The possibility of generating a unique, single-source token that can be used to send emails to an individual is a desirable but not currently supported feature for email protocols.JMAP has garnered attention for being an efficient protocol that can replace IMAP, especially in mobile environments. However, comments on an HN post suggest that it lacks end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and encryption at rest, which are significant concerns. Additionally, some users proposed using unique email addresses for managing spam and reducing information overload, but there are reservations about using random or lengthy email addresses as standard. Lastly, some users raised concerns with the implementation of E2EE, and proposed solutions using probabilistic filters like bloom filters for search. JMAP only supports TLS, and there is a draft for including sender encryption in JMAP.The article discusses the potential of the JMAP protocol as an alternative to IMAP/SMTP for email communication. JMAP aims to simplify email communication for developers by using a JSON-based API instead of the more complex IMAP/SMTP protocols. Some readers are hopeful about the potential of JMAP, as it would make it easier to create new email clients, but others are skeptical about its adoption due to established email providers' resistance to change. The discussion also includes ideas for improving email search capabilities, implementing encryption, and delegating user management to SQL databases or LDAP directories. Overall, the article highlights the need for more innovation in the email communication space and a simpler solution for developers.JMAP, an open standard email client that utilizes JSON and HTTP over TLS protocols, has been released as an alternative to IMAP/SMTP, but adoption is limited due to Gmail's monopoly. JMAP features a stateless protocol, the ability to fetch updates efficiently, and WebPush-style push notifications. However, converting mail to classical mail instead of existing protocols remains an obstacle. While Fastmail and Cyrus IMAP server support JMAP, its lack of clients means that it cannot be widely deployed. Additionally, Gmail's lack of support for JMAP means that it is not a priority. Users' unmet needs, along with potential proprietary API integration by Gmail, limit JMAP's adoption.Fastmail's open-source JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) enables easy offline data sync and support of email access API standard with a simple design principle. A proxy feature in Stalwart and jmap-perl allows for support of\u00a0IMAP clients. Microsoft and Apple should support the JMAP protocol. Fastmail receives praise for its superior services, filtering, and spam protection. Encrypted email integration is desirable. JMAP has gained interest since it offers an alternative to proprietary email APIs that only work with Gmail. People who access their emails across multiple devices to keep everything in sync opt for JMAP, a less complicated replacement for IMAP. Numerous articles on HN have been published on the JMAP protocol since 2014.",
    "hn_summary": "- JMAP simplifies integration of masked emails and FastMail offers a workaround with \"sending identities\"\n- FastMail is an independent email service with beloved features and pricing but lacking end-to-end encryption\n- JMAP is a potential alternative to IMAP/SMTP, but adoption is limited due to Gmail's monopoly and lack of clients and support"

    "content": "The Crab Programming LanguageThis is the main source code repository for Crab. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.Note: this README is for users rather than contributors. If you wish to contribute to the compiler, you should read CONTRIBUTING.md instead.Quick StartTo get started with the renamed CrabLang toolchain, run the following:sh <(curl https://install.crablang.org -L)* currently Unix onlyInstalling from SourceThe Crab build system uses a Python script called x.py to build the compiler, which manages the bootstrapping process. It lives at the root of the project.The x.py command can be run directly on most Unix systems in the following format:./x.py <subcommand> [flags]This is how the documentation and examples assume you are running x.py.Some alternative ways are:# On a Unix shell if you don't have the necessary `python3` command./x <subcommand> [flags]# On the Windows Command Prompt (if .py files are configured to run Python)x.py <subcommand> [flags]# You can also run Python yourself, e.g.:python x.py <subcommand> [flags]More information about x.py can be found by running it with the --help flag or reading the crabc dev guide.DependenciesMake sure you have installed the dependencies:python 3 or 2.7gitA C compiler (when building for the host, cc is enough; cross-compiling may need additional compilers)curl (not needed on Windows)pkg-config if you are compiling on Linux and targeting Linuxlibiconv (already included with glibc on Debian-based distros)To build Crabgo, you'll also need OpenSSL (libssl-dev or openssl-devel on most Unix distros).If building LLVM from source, you'll need additional tools:g++, clang++, or MSVC with versions listed on LLVM's documentationninja, or GNU make 3.81 or later (Ninja is recommended, especially on Windows)cmake 3.13.4 or laterlibstdc++-static may be required on some Linux distributions such as Fedora and UbuntuOn tier 1 or tier 2 with host tools platforms, you can also choose to download LLVM by setting llvm.download-ci-llvm = true. Otherwise, you'll need LLVM installed and llvm-config in your path. See the crabc-dev-guide for more info.Building on a Unix-like systemClone the source with git:git clone https://github.com/crablang/crab.gitcd crabConfigure the build settings:The CrabLang build system uses a file named config.toml in the root of the source tree to determine various configuration settings for the build. Set up the defaults intended for distros to get started. You can see a full list of options in config.example.toml.printf 'profile = \"user\" \\nchangelog-seen = 2 \\n' > config.tomlIf you plan to use x.py install to create an installation, it is recommended that you set the prefix value in the [install] section to a directory.Build and install:./x.py build && ./x.py installWhen complete, ./x.py install will place several programs into $PREFIX/bin: crabc, the CrabLang compiler, and crablangdoc, the API-documentation tool. If you've set profile = \"user\" or build.extended = true, it will also include Crabgo, CrabLang's package manager.Building on WindowsOn Windows, we suggest using winget to install dependencies by running the following in a terminal:winget install -e Python.Python.3winget install -e Kitware.CMakewinget install -e Git.GitThen edit your system's PATH variable and add: C:\\Program Files\\CMake\\bin. See this guide on editing the system PATH from the Java documentation.There are two prominent ABIs in use on Windows: the native (MSVC) ABI used by Visual Studio and the GNU ABI used by the GCC toolchain. Which version of CrabLang you need depends largely on what C/C++ libraries you want to interoperate with. Use the MSVC build of CrabLang to interop with software produced by Visual Studio and the GNU build to interop with GNU software built using the MinGW/MSYS2 toolchain.MinGWMSYS2 can be used to easily build CrabLang on Windows:Download the latest MSYS2 installer and go through the installer.Run mingw32_shell.bat or mingw64_shell.bat from the MSYS2 installation directory (e.g. C:\\msys64), depending on whether you want 32-bit or 64-bit CrabLang. (As of the latest version of MSYS2 you have to run msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32 or msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64 from the command line instead.)From this terminal, install the required tools:# Update package mirrors (may be needed if you have a fresh install of MSYS2)pacman -Sy pacman-mirrors# Install build tools needed for CrabLang. If you're building a 32-bit compiler,# then replace \"x86_64\" below with \"i686\". If you've already got Git, Python,# or CMake installed and in PATH you can remove them from this list.# Note that it is important that you do **not** use the 'python2', 'cmake',# and 'ninja' packages from the 'msys2' subsystem.# The build has historically been known to fail with these packages.pacman -S git \\      make \\      diffutils \\      tar \\      mingw-w64-x86_64-python \\      mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \\      mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc \\      mingw-w64-x86_64-ninjaNavigate to CrabLang's source code (or clone it), then build it:./x.py build && ./x.py installMSVCMSVC builds of CrabLang additionally require an installation of Visual Studio 2017 (or later) so crabc can use its linker. The simplest way is to get Visual Studio, check the \"C++ build tools\" and \"Windows 10 SDK\" workload.(If you're installing CMake yourself, be careful that \"C++ CMake tools for Windows\" doesn't get included under \"Individual components\".)With these dependencies installed, you can build the compiler in a cmd.exe shell with:python x.py buildRight now, building CrabLang only works with some known versions of Visual Studio. If you have a more recent version installed and the build system doesn't understand, you may need to force crablangbuild to use an older version. This can be done by manually calling the appropriate vcvars file before running the bootstrap.CALL \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvars64.bat\"python x.py buildSpecifying an ABIEach specific ABI can also be used from either environment (for example, using the GNU ABI in PowerShell) by using an explicit build triple. The available Windows build triples are:GNU ABI (using GCC)i686-pc-windows-gnux86_64-pc-windows-gnuThe MSVC ABIi686-pc-windows-msvcx86_64-pc-windows-msvcThe build triple can be specified by either specifying --build=<triple> when invoking x.py commands, or by creating a config.toml file (as described in Installing from Source), and modifying the build option under the [build] section.Configure and MakeWhile it's not the recommended build system, this project also provides a configure script and makefile (the latter of which just invokes x.py)../configuremake && sudo make installconfigure generates a config.toml which can also be used with normal x.py invocations.Building DocumentationIf you'd like to build the documentation, it's almost the same:./x.py docThe generated documentation will appear under doc in the build directory for the ABI used. That is, if the ABI was x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, the directory will be build\\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\doc.NotesSince the CrabLang compiler is written in CrabLang, it must be built by a precompiled \"snapshot\" version of itself (made in an earlier stage of development). As such, source builds require an Internet connection to fetch snapshots, and an OS that can execute the available snapshot binaries.See https://doc.crablang.org/nightly/crabc/platform-support.html for a list of supported platforms. Only \"host tools\" platforms have a pre-compiled snapshot binary available; to compile for a platform without host tools you must cross-compile.You may find that other platforms work, but these are our officially supported build environments that are most likely to work.Getting HelpNeed help?

    "hn_content": "Rust has been forked to create Crab Language, which promises to have 100% less bureaucracy as it doesn't have a trademark policy. However, all commits are auto-merges of Rust's main branch, and the project isn't actually doing any work yet. Rust is experiencing growing pains with developing a governance structure that works for everyone, which they are still trying to figure out. The goal of the Crab Language is to influence Rust stakeholders' decisions. Fragmentation from the fork could slow down Rust's progress, but it could also become a place to test ideas and port successful concepts over to Rust. The lack of transparency in Rust's interim missteps can be interpreted as \"bureaucracy\" to outsiders. The Rust Foundation tries to stay hands-off on technical decisions and does not interfere in how teams organize themselves.Developers are discussing a fork of Rust programming language called CrabLang due to disagreements over trademark licensing that have left negative impressions on Rust's governance and leadership. However, some commentators argue that forking can still benefit the original project, citing examples like Node.js and GCC. Others note that human interaction is complex and that community behaviors are unavoidable in large programming projects. Meanwhile, amidst concerns about Rust's leadership, some voices suggest that a clean house and electing new people to lead is in order. This situation brings to light the power games and politics that are part of FOSS projects. However, some comments suggest that this drama is nothing new or controversial, and rivalries between developers and projects can be beneficial in some cases.- The Rust community has some members who aggressively seek attention, but this is not unique to Rust.\n- The creation of Crab, a Rust fork, is mainly to avoid trademark infringement.\n- Rust was always supported by major corporations, like FAANG.\n- The more open a project is governed, the more likely problems will arise.\n- .NET/C# is not without drama, and MS has made toxic steps with community projects.\n- Multiple variants of a language can create problems with interoperability, but establishing a common language is essential.\n- The Crab project does not seem to have a significant impact, and ignoring drama is the best way to get rid of narcissists and idiots.\n- There is a debate about whether forking Rust, a language aimed to be the long-term systems language, is a good choice.A debate surrounding the Rust programming language's trademark policy and leadership has led to the creation of a forked version called \"Crab\". Some contributors feel that the Rust Foundation's trademark policy is too strict, and that the leadership is causing issues. Critics fear that the creation of this fork could lead to a fracturing of the Rust community. However, others argue that forking doesn't necessarily have to be a zero-sum game, and can potentially benefit both parties. While some see this move as a credible threat to enable pushback against an unresponsive leadership, others worry that the fork may introduce more confusion and instability, ultimately causing more work for contributors. Some notable contributors have already weighed in on the matter, but it is unclear yet whether this fork will gain traction or die off quickly.The Rust community is experiencing drama stemming from recent trademark policies, with a possible fork of the Rust Project occurring. The fork is seen as a negotiation tactic or a genuine effort by various parties. The main issue is whether the fork leads to a better experience for writing systems code with strict ownership semantics, and there have been discussions around alternative governance models for Rust. Some individuals have expressed concerns over the name and trademark policies of the Rust Foundation, arguing that it is important to protect the language's trademarks. However, others have questioned the need for this level of control and point to open-source programming languages without similar policies. Regardless, the fork is yet to present a lot of credible and high-level contributors.A community fork of the Rust programming language, called CrabLang, has been created as a response to the Rust Foundation's restrictive trademark policy. The policy has been criticised for dividing the Rust community into \"official\" and \"unofficial\" users, and hindering creativity and promotion. The CrabLang Collective plans to maintain a balance between corporate influence and the will of the community, providing an alternative for those who share their concerns and seek unrestricted use. The group plans to keep its main branch up to date with the upstream codebase, hoping to maintain a spirit of collaboration, innovation, and creative freedom. Critics have suggested the recent drama surrounding Rust is down to a communication failure, but proponents of the CrabLang fork believe it represents a necessary and long-overdue solution to an existing problem.\n- GNU's uncompromising stance on values have reportedly caused it to lose relevance in the computing industry.\n- Richard Stallman's abrasive and confrontational posturing has damaged the chances of reaching his goals.\n- The GNU \"copyleft\" license has fallen more into disuse in favor of less restrictive licenses such as BSD and MIT.\n- There are still important GNU projects like GCC, GNU libc, and Grub.\n- GNU seeks to recreate a 1988 Unix, potentially limiting their ability to stay at the forefront of computing.\n- The FSF and GNU's lack of compromise affects effective advocacy, hindering progress in the long run.\n- Stallman has reportedly made many people uncomfortable and has a lack of manners up to modern standards.\n- Stallman has contributed an incredible amount of software and has been a very important factor in the free software movement.There is a discussion about the reputation of Richard Stallman, the founder of the FSF. Although some people believe that his contributions to the field are essential, others refuse to interact with him due to his reputation. Stallman is known to be an inflexible person with polarizing views. The debate includes anecdotes about his position in relation to the GPL, the need for microcode, and his emphasis on calling a Linux distro 'GNU/Linux' to give him credit. There is also speculation about why some large corporate entities in tech don't support his ideas. Regardless of the debates, Stallman's ideas have shifted the 'Overton Window' of software copyright towards more openness.No meaningful summary or content to include.",

    "content": "I gave commit rights to someone I didn't know, I could never have guessed what happened next!SEPTEMBER 17, 2016 \u00b7 4 MINUTE READ(Spoiler: trusting your contributors works)Some years ago, I polished up and released an abandoned project for storing financial data in Django. It let you declare \u201cMoney\u201d fields on your models, dealing with proper storage and currencies for you.My use case for the library, django-money eventually faded, but it ended up teaching me a useful lesson in trust and OSS abandonware.Some time after the project I was using django-money for was binned, I read a blog post about trusting OSS contributors.I don\u2019t recall the author now, but the gist of the argument made was that we\u2019re too protective of our code - if you give someone responsibility, show that you trust them, more often than not, your intuition about people abusing their freedom is way off. On the contrary, giving a diligent contributor commit rights will often have the opposite effect from what you might expect, making people take their contributions even more seriously.Obviously this has caveats and depends on what your project is - but the gist of the post really struck a chord.A few weeks later, I was going over issues and contributions for the projects I maintained on Github, when a massive PR emerged for django-money. Someone had fixed tons of bugs and orchestrated a much larger group of contributors around a fork they\u2019d made of my project, and now they were asking me to merge their fixes back upstream.The PR was bigger than what I felt I could sensibly review and, in honesty, my desire to go through the hours of work I could tell this would take for a project I no longer used was not stellar. But I remembered that blog post. So, instead of doing what I\u2019d done previously when someone sent hard-to-review PRs to other projects and close them with a short note on how to break it into reviewable parts, I did something different.I opened the project settings, and I gave this person I\u2019d never heard of commit rights to the repo.And then I wrote a comment on the PR saying as much:And then I forgot all about it.A few years laterI\u2019m having lunch with some friends, and one of them mentions that they were reviewing django addons to handle money. I say, that\u2019s funny - I\u2019ve got a project on Github for doing that, django-money.To which my friend says \u201cYOU built django-money!?? That was one of the libraries we were reviewing!\u201dI\u2019m entirely startled - how had they found my obscure little library? I browse over to my github profile, and realize something I had not before - django-money was, by far, the most popular repository I have. As in, all the other repos with one-off things had a few stars, django-money had several hundred!So, I open it up, and it was like walking into a factory filled with people I\u2019d never met, PRs flying. It was a very odd feeling, since it was all happening on my Github page, right under my nose!After digging some, it turns out that Greg Reinbach, the guy who opened the PR, had eventually done basically the same thing I did, and given a third person commit rights, Benjamin Bach.Benjamin had since then, for several years at this point, quietly been maintaining the project, reviewing PRs that people sent, making sure CI hummed along and so on. And as he had, the project had slowly but surely gained more and more adoption, to the point where it was now being considered to be used for a project at the crowdfunding platform where my friend worked.Wrap-upWe eventually moved the project into it\u2019s own org, Benjamin is still maintaining the project, and the world is a tiny bit better at building web-apps because of it.So, I guess this is my way of saying thanks, whoever you are, who wrote that blog post back in 2012; you were right.See alsoAsynchronous transactional patternsOn professionalism in softwareBrian Flanagan goes to IrelandThe end of the market",

The post cites past incidents, such as when the creator of uBlock adblock extension handed off the reins to a contributor who promptly removed all references to the original creator and charged for the plugin & turned it into an affiliate marketing product. The conversation includes opinions on code review, commit history, and how easy it is for bad actors to take over popular extensions. The post serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering giving commit rights to unknown contributors.The article discusses the importance of good commit messages and how they can impact the understanding of code changes in the future. It also delves into how larger code changes can be time-consuming to review, even if they don't seem that substantial at first glance. Some commenters mention the importance of well-designed libraries, good tests, and the difficulties of maintaining large projects. Overall, the post highlights the challenges of managing code changes in open-source projects and the need for clear and concise communication.Software engineers discuss the difficulty of reviewing large pull requests (PRs) with thousands of lines of code, with most agreeing that such PRs are problematic due to their potential to introduce bugs, be more difficult to bisect, and be overlooked. However, some argue that large PRs can be necessary for complex or fundamental code changes, with trust and thoughtful code walkthroughs essential to ensure that the changes are necessary. Some examples of when large changes are necessary include modifying the type system, refactoring large swaths of the project, upgrading frameworks with breaking changes, and adding new features that require modifications to existing code. Trust in colleagues and ownership of and responsibility for the code is also crucial to effective software development.In this HN thread, individuals discuss the merits and drawbacks of giving commit rights to contributors in open-source projects. Some argue that it fosters community engagement and speeds up development, while others caution about the risk of abuse. It is suggested that trust should be given gradually, through proven good PRs and community participation. While survivorship bias is brought up, some examples of successful \"commit bit to everyone\" approaches are also shared. Additionally, concerns around the security risks of giving commit rights to non-administrative users are discussed. The thread includes tangential conversations on human psychology and in-person vs. remote collaboration.- A discussion on using personal accounts and repos versus organizations for growing open-source projects with a team\n- Some argue that using personal accounts can lead to the maintainer becoming the bottleneck and gatekeeper for development, while others believe that a personal repo doesn't preclude growing the project with a team\n- A user shared a positive experience of taking over a small abandoned repository through an org\n- Some commenters express concerns about giving commit rights to random contributors, or creating unnecessary overhead and complexity with orgs\n- Others mention the risk of supporting abandoned repos or the importance of ongoing communication in collaborations.",

Suggestions include skydiving, hobbies with events and competitions, throwing block parties, and welcoming neighbors with small gifts. Some respondents believe that front yard spaces and other community design features facilitate social interactions, while others express a preference for privacy and less frequent interactions with neighbors. Overall, people find that building a sense of neighborhood or other community connections leads to feelings of purpose, support, and friendship.A discussion on the significance of spending time with others in building relationships, particularly with neighbors. Some users suggest strategies to interact with neighbors, such as volunteering or offering help, while others share their experiences with building community through sports programs or animal shelters. Some comments touch on the challenges of building community in certain regions, such as the difficulty of gardening in desert areas. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of human connections and suggests practical ways to nurture them.The benefits of volunteering for personal growth and the potential to build a community are discussed. A commenter cautions against scams and high fees that some organizations charge for volunteer work. Another suggests joining a fitness community, highlighting the benefits of shared experience and camaraderie. Climbing and bouldering are suggested as sports that can facilitate the creation of friendships with a diverse range of people. However, one commenter suggests that some climbing gyms may not be welcoming to non-conformists or individuals who do not fit a certain look or demographic.The article discusses how non-tech related communities, such as sports teams, martial arts, yoga, and church, can be great places to build connections and friendships outside of work. The article highlights the benefits of shared experiences and emphasizes the importance of finding diverse communities to engage with. The article also mentions the potential downsides of hierarchical structures in some martial arts but notes that this differs depending on the specific practice. Overall, the article encourages readers to explore and invest in diverse communities to build meaningful connections and friendships outside of work.Various individuals suggest different options for meeting new people and making friends, including going to church (especially a Catholic one), joining clubs or groups that share your interests (like hackerspaces, sports teams, or book clubs), and participating in online communities. Emphasis is placed on finding places where psychological safety is high so that people can be vulnerable and form real connections. Different individuals also suggest bonding over shared activities like drinking beer, attending dog parks, or playing bunco or poker with neighbors. It is noted that meeting new people is important for social mobility and accessing opportunities that might not otherwise be available.Service clubs like Rotary are facing a demographic crisis just as people show renewed interest in in-person social and community engagement. Volunteering for programs like FIRST, joining local political or religious organizations, and pursuing hobbies with like-minded individuals are great ways to connect with others and find purpose. However, some groups like Rotary and Freemasonry may not be technologically savvy, preferring phone or in-person communication. Additionally, some may have rules or expectations that conflict with certain beliefs or lifestyles. It's important to find a community that aligns with personal values and interests. Overall, seeking connections and engaging with others can lead to a more fulfilling life.The thread discusses the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses. The group is known for defellowshipping (shunning) members who leave the faith, and not accepting blood transfusions. They refute the claim that they expect people to die rather than accept transfusions. The conversation touches on the nature of religion, shared beliefs, and community. Some people criticize the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses as cult-like, but others support the group and find meaning in their beliefs. The post may interest those curious about Jehovah's Witnesses or the relationship between beliefs, community, and individuals.There are various ways to find and build community, including through sports teams, volunteering, Meetup groups, gyms, fostering rescue animals, and local playgrounds. Additionally, some have found community through church, ultimate frisbee, gaming guilds, and fraternities. It's important to put yourself out there and make an effort to connect with others. Being consistent and showing up regularly is key to building lasting relationships.No meaningful content found.",

Some express that they prefer to keep a social distance from neighbors. Others suggest implementing front yard design spaces to promote social interaction between residents. Many agree that making connections with others is more important than ever in our current society.Spending time with people is the most significant factor in building relationships, and this can be achieved by interacting with neighbors. Offering help in situations like gardening or volunteering is an excellent way to start these interactions, even for those who don't like small talk. Having a friendly dog can also help initiate conversations with people. Volunteering, especially in places related to one's interests or hobbies, is a scientifically proven way to improve happiness and establish a sense of community. It can be challenging to establish relationships with neighbors in apartments, but in single-floor homes or communities, there is more interaction. Gardening can be a way to connect with neighbors and build relationships, and volunteering at local communities can bring unexpected experiences and connections.The discussion on volunteering emphasizes its importance as a valuable aspect of life. A user highlights the impossibly easy way of finding volunteer activities if one has kids. But, another user sees many scammers in volunteering. The discussion includes a focus on fitness communities as places to build communities of people who share something in common and have nothing to do with work. Although some users mentioned some negativity around gym communities, most agreed that it is an excellent way to meet new people for young adults. Furthermore, rock climbing was an inclusive space, too, and non-conforming individuals found it welcoming. Climbing was seen as an intellectual pursuit.The comments section discusses how community-building occurs through shared physical activities, such as martial arts, CrossFit, and yoga. Participants form bonds through shared \"misery\" and can serve as peer mentors to new members. Some argue that the hierarchal structure of martial arts can be exclusive, while others feel that it provides a more accurate reflection of skill level. Other community-building activities not related to exercise include attending church and organizing events to bring people together. While some people seek out tech communities, others prefer activities outside of the tech world to keep their interests and social lives diverse. Overall, community-building is a positive force in people's lives and enhances their physical and mental well-being.The article discusses various ways to meet new people and form new communities. One suggestion is to attend church, especially as it promotes social interaction and encourages people from all backgrounds to join. Other potential ways to form social networks include joining sporting groups, attending Meetup events, joining hackerspaces, or using apps like Bumble BFF to connect with like-minded people. The article highlights the benefits of forming meaningful connections and encourages readers to explore different avenues to expand their social circle.Service clubs like Rotary are facing an existential demographic crash, despite a renewed interest in IRL social/community engagement, due to resistance to technology. Many people have found fulfilling connections through hobbies, interests, and volunteering, such as open source projects, cycling, pinball, folk music, and volunteering for FIRST programs. Some have found a sense of community and purpose through religious groups, such as the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses or the Democratic Party. However, some caution against casually joining a religion for the sake of making friends. Building relationships with like-minded people through these avenues is an effective way to combat loneliness and isolation, especially for those with transactional relationships at work or who are working from home.The discussion revolves around Jehovah's Witnesses and their practices, including the controversial practice of shunning those who leave the faith. The topic of blood transfusions and their prohibition in the religion is also discussed. Some comments express disbelief in religious beliefs in general or critique Jehovah's Witnesses' practices. The original poster asks for suggestions for communities to join solely for the purpose of socializing, and there is some discussion around the ambiguity of attending religious services without sharing the same faith. One commenter suggests Unitarian Universalists as an explicitly inclusive religious organization.No meaningful content found.No meaningful content to provide a summary.",

Some of these advancements include PaC-trees, tree algorithms for succinct data structures, and functional frameworks for chemical data. There are also recommendations for simplified finger trees and Zip trees.

The post highlights the importance of reasoning about amortized runtimes and some suggested reading. It's noted that computer scientists and engineers care about real-world performance and the theory/systems split in the field.The article discusses the benefits of pure functional data structures, which are immutable and lack shared mutable state, making them safer for parallel programming and reducing bugs. The article relates this to the broader concept of programming with immutable values and a more declarative style that can be easier to understand and reason about, as it allows for tracing the flow of data. The article also notes that different hardware may be better suited to different collections of hardware and workloads, with GPUs being more useful for vectorized/parallel workloads involving simple operations.\n- Purely functional data structures allow for immutability and declarative style, reducing issues with concurrency and data races\n- They force programmers to be deliberate about where and when state changes occur, improving reasoning, reducing bugs, and easing debugging\n- Immutable structures can reduce race conditions in parallel code and optimize memory usage \n- Functional programs have no side effects, making them adaptable for parallel tasks (such as MapReduce)\n- The merit of pure FP is the same input to a function yields the same output, making debugging easier and more efficient \n- However, bad programming can still produce bad programs regardless of language, and good tools cannot entirely prevent it \n- Available resources on purely functional data structures include a survey by Chris Okasaki and translations of the concepts to languages like TypeScript and F#",

That\u2019s why the main metric tracked by screen time apps is deceptive: ten minutes of shooting crack cocaine intravenously are still ten minutes of shooting crack cocaine intravenously.But that\u2019s expected: a tech company trying to cop around how much you use your devices is like a booze maker helping you track how much booze you should drink. Sure, they want to keep you alive: you are the consumer after all, and you must be around to consume.AA meetings don\u2019t give out badges to members who drink for less than 2 hours per day. Or to those who stop drinking 2 hours before bed.Improving the relationship with your phone requires conscious decisions. It\u2019s like couples therapy, but for you and your tech. Sometimes you need some me-time, sometimes it\u2019s better to break up. Sometimes, everything is great!
