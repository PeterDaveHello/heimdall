When Voyager 1 sends messages to Earth, roughly how many photons are (1) transmitted and (2) received per bit? electromagnetic-radiation estimation antennas radio space-travel Share Cite Improve this question Follow Follow this question to receive notifications edited 2 days ago Qmechanic♦ 204k4747 gold badges559559 silver badges2.3k2.3k bronze badges asked 2 days ago Craig GidneyCraig Gidney 6,54222 gold badges3030 silver badges3939 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 1 $\\begingroup$ There is now a long thread on HackerNews about this post: news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40561872 $\\endgroup$ – Punnerud 39 mins ago Add a comment2 Answers Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) This answer is useful 95 Save this answer. Show activity on this post. $\\begingroup$ For an exact calculation we need to address a few choices: (you can change them, the answer will not be tremendously affected) What is the receiver? Let's assume a 70 m dish, like this one [CDSCC] in the Deep Space Network. [Voyager 1] can transmit at $2.3 {\\rm GHz}$ or $8.4 {\\rm GHz}$. Let's assume $8.4 {\\rm GHz}$, for better beam forming (but probably it can only use the lowest frequency at the highest power, so this could be too optimistic). Does \"received\" mean all photons hitting the antenna dish, or only those entering the electronic circuit of the first LNA? A similar question can be asked for the transmitter in the space craft. We'll ignore this here since losses related to illuminators or Cassegrain construction will not even be one order of magnitude, insignificant compared with the rest. Answers: A) Voyager sends $160$ bits/second with $23{\\rm W}$. Using $8.3 {\\rm GHz}$ this is $4 \\cdot 10^{24}$ photons per second, or $2.6 \\cdot 10^{22}$ per bit, because for frequency $f$ the energy per photon is only $$E_\\phi=\\hbar\\, \\omega=2\\pi\\hbar f=5.5\\cdot10^{-24}{\\rm J} \\ \\ \\text{or} \\ \\ 5.5 \\ \\text{yJ (yoctojoule)}.$$ B) The beam forming by Voyager's $d=3.7{\\rm m}$ dish will direct them predominantly to Earth, with $(\\pi d/\\lambda)^2$ antenna gain, but still, at the current distance of $R=23.5$ billion kilometers, this only results in $3.4\\cdot10^{-22}$ Watt per square meter reaching Earth, so a receiver with a $D=70{\\rm m}$ dish will collect only $1.3$ attowatt ($1.3\\cdot 10^{-18}{\\rm W}$), summarized by: $$ P_{\\rm received} = P_{\\rm transmit}\\ \\Big(\\frac{\\pi d}{\\lambda}\\Big)^2 \\ \\frac1{4\\pi R^2}\\ \\frac{\\pi D^2}4 $$ Dividing by $E_\\phi$ we see that this power then still corresponds to c. $240000$ photons per second, or $1500$ photons per bit. If we assume $f=2.3{\\rm GHz}$ this becomes $415$ photons per bit. And if we introduce some realistic losses here and there perhaps only half of that. C) (Although not asked in the question) how many photons per bit are needed? The [Shannon limit] $ C=B \\, \\log_2(1+{\\large\\frac{S}{N}})$, relates bandwidth $B$, and $S/N$ ratio to maximum channel capacity. It follows that with only thermal noise $N=k\\, T_{\\rm noise}\\,B$, the required energy per bit is: $$ E_{\\rm bit} = \\frac S C = k\\, T_{\\rm noise} \\ \\frac{2^{\\,C/B}-1}{C/B} \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\lim_{C\\ll B}\\ E_{\\rm bit} = k\\, T_{\\rm noise} \\log 2, $$ where $C\\ll B$ is the so-called \"ultimate\" Shannon limit. With only the CMB $(T_{\\rm noise}\\!=\\!3{\\rm K})$ we would then need $41 {\\rm yJ}$, or $41 \\cdot 10^{-24}\\,{\\rm J}$, per bit. That's only $7.5$ photons at $8.3 {\\rm GHz}$. But additional atmospheric noise and circuit noise, even with a good cryogenic receiver, could easily raise $T_{\\rm noise}$ to about $10{\\rm K}$ and then we need $25$ photons per bit at $8.3 {\\rm GHz}$, and even $91$ at $2.3 {\\rm GHz}$. So clearly there is not much margin.

The thermal noise Jos discusses at the end of the answer is the 'random' photons from the environment that are absorbed by the antenna. Deep space probes operate in parts of the spectrum no one else is allowed to radiate in to avoid manmade noise. $\\endgroup$ – Dan Is Fiddling By Firelight 15 hours ago 1 $\\begingroup$ On \"bad weather days\" the atmosphere can of course add more thermal noise than the value I used in the example. Also the cryogenic LNA's can be somewhat worse.

    "commentBody": "How many photons are received per bit transmitted from Voyager 1? (physics.stackexchange.com)603 points by williamsmj 6 hours agohidepastfavorite123 comments Strilanc 4 hours agoWasn't expecting my question to hit top of HN. I guess I'll give some context for why I asked it. I work in quantum error correction, and was trying to collect interesting and quantitative examples of repetition codes being used implicitly in classical systems. Stuff like DRAM storing a 0 or 1 via the presence or absence of 40K electrons [1], undersea cables sending X photons per bit (don't know that one yet), some kind of number for a transistor switching (haven't even decided on the number for that one yet), etc. A key reason quantum computing is so hard is that by default repetition makes things worse instead of better, because every repetition is another chance for an unintended measurement. So protecting a qubit tends to require special physical properties, like the energy gap of a superconductor, or complex error correction strategies like surface codes. A surface code can easily use 1000 physical qubits to store 1 logical qubit [2], and I wanted to contrast that with the sizes of implicit repetition codes used in classical computing. 1: https://web.mit.edu/rec/www/dramfaq/DRAMFAQ.html 2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928 reply cycomanic 4 hours agoparentSubsea cables don't use repetition codes (they are very much suboptimal), but typically use large overhead (20%) LDPC codes (as do satellite comms systems for that matter (the dvb-s2 standard is a good example). Generally to get anywhere close to Shannon we always need sophisticated coding. Regarding the sensitivity of Subsea systems they are still significantly above 1 photon/bit, the highest sensitivity experiments have been done for optical space comms (look e.g. for the work from Mit Lincoln Labs, David Geisler, David Kaplan and Bryan Robinson are some of the people to look for. reply Strilanc 4 hours agorootparentI think you're picturing a different level of the network stack than I had in mind. Yes, above the physical level they will be explicitly using very sophisticated codes. But I think physically it is the case that messages are transmitted using pulses of photons, where a pulse will contain many photons and will lose ~5% of its photons per kilometer when travelling through fiber (which is why amplifiers are needed along the way). In this case the \"repetition code\" is the number of photons in a pulse. reply cycomanic 2 hours agorootparentBut we are classical, so I think it's wrong (or at least confusing) to talk about the many photons as repetition codes. Then we might as well start to call all classical phenomena repetition codes. Also how would you define SNR when doing this? Repetition codes have a very clearly defined meaning in communication theory, using them to mean something else is very confusing. reply jessriedel 1 hour agorootparent> Then we might as well start to call all classical phenomena repetition codes All classical phenomena are repetition codes (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5082 ). And this is perfectly compatible with the meaning in communication theory, except that the symbols we're talking about are the states of the fundamental physical degrees of freedom. In the exact same sense, the von Neumann entropy of a density matrix is the Shannon entropy of its spectrum, and no one says \"we shouldn't call that the Shannon entropy because Shannon originally intended to apply it to macroscopic signals on a communication line\". reply Strilanc 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, I agree it's unusual to describe \"increased brightness\" as \"bigger distance repetition code\". But I think it'll be a useful analogy in context, and I'd of course explain that. reply s1dev 32 minutes agoparentprevI believe that a classical radio receiver is measuring a coherent state. This is a much lower level notion than people normally think about in QEC since the physical DoF are usually already fixed (and assumed to be a qubit!) in QEC. The closest analogue might be different choices of qubit encodings in a bosonic code. In general, I'm not sure that the classical information theory toolkit allows us to compare a coherent state with some average occupation number N to say, M (not necessarily coherent) states with average occupation number N' such that N' * M = N. For example, you could use a state that is definitely not \"classical\" / a coherent state or you could use photon number resolving measurements. A tangential remark: The classical information theory field uses this notion of \"energy per bit\" to be able to compare more universally between information transmission schemes. So they would ask something like \"How many bits can I transmit with X bandwidth and Y transmission power?\" reply resters 2 hours agoparentprevIsn't sending more than one photon always \"repetition\" in that sense? Classical systems probably don't do that because of the engineering complexity of sending a single photon at a time -- we had oscillators and switches, not single photon emitters. reply jessriedel 1 hour agorootparent> Isn't sending more than one photon always \"repetition\" in that sense? Yes. But regardless of whether its feasible to send single quanta in any given circumstance, the redundant nature of the signals is key to understanding its much higher degree of robustness relative to quantum signals. And to be clear, you can absolutely send a classical signal with individual quanta. reply grog454 4 hours agoparentprev> by default repetition makes things worse instead of better Can you elaborate on this a bit? My intuition is that, by default, statistical models benefit from larger N. But I have no experience in quantum physics. reply Strilanc 4 hours agorootparentIt's because unintended measurement is a type of error in a quantum computer. Like, if an electron passing near your qubit would get pushed left if your qubit was 0 and right if was 1, then you will see errors when electrons pass by. Repeating the 0 or 1 a thousand times just means there's 1000x more places that electrons passing by would cause a problem. That kind of redundancy makes that kind of error mechanism worse instead of better. There are ways of repeating quantum information that protect against accidental measurement errors. For example, if your logical 0 is |000> + |110> + |011> + |101> and your logical 1 is |111> + |001> + |100> + |010> then can recover from one accidental measurement. And there are more complex states that protect against both bitflip errors and accidental measurements simultaneously. They're just more complicated to describe (and implement!) than \"use 0000000 instead of 0 and 1111111 instead of 1\". reply nomel 53 minutes agorootparentIs this the correct interpretation? Classical systems: You measure some state, with the measurement containing some error. Averaging the measurement error usually gets closer to the actual value. Quantum systems: Your measurement influences/can influence the state, which can cause an error in the state itself. Multiple measurements means more possible influence. reply Kerbonut 2 hours agorootparentprevIf there's interference, could you do something like when using 7 repetition for each bit, take whatever 5 of 7 is, e.g. 1111100 is 1 and 1100000 is 0. reply ziofill 4 hours agorootparentprevIt actually depends how this sentence is intended. There exist quantum repetition codes: the Shor code is the simplest example that uses 9 physical qubits per logical qubit. Since the information is quantum it needs majority voting over two independent bases (hence 3x3=9 qubits to encode a logical one). reply Sniffnoy 1 hour agorootparentprevYou might be making the mistake of thinking that quantum mechanics runs on probabilities, which work in the way you are used to, when in fact it runs on amplitudes, which work quite differently. reply nico 4 hours agoparentprevVery cool. It’s interesting to realize that at some level, every system is a quantum system if you “zoom in” enough reply empyrrhicist 4 hours agorootparentI think the point is the model though - if a system's behavior can be modeled/described classically, it's a bit silly to to call it a \"quantum\" system in the same way that it's reductive to say Biology is just applied particle physics. Sure, but that's not a very useful level of abstraction. reply jessriedel 1 hour agorootparentIf you want to understand the transition between a fundamental theory and its effective description in some limiting regime, you need to be able to describe a system in the limiting regime using the fundamental theory. It's not \"silly\" to talk about an atom having a gravitational field even if it's unmeasurably small (currently). reply fsckboy 3 hours agorootparentprev> at some level, every system is a quantum system if we consider \"quantum\" to mean our quantum theory, at the level of general relativity, gravity is not a quantum system. and the qualifier \"yet\" is also not known. reply Ringz 4 hours agorootparentprevI would spontaneously respond that you are right and at the same time have no problem if someone explains to me that it is not so. reply fsckboy 3 hours agoparentprev> How many photons are received per bit transmitted from Voyager 1? wouldn't you also want to know how many photons are transmitted and how many bits transmitted are received? reply stracer 3 hours agorootparentAll transmitted bits are also received, at least when everything works as intended. reply cycomanic 4 hours agoprevActually the limit predicted by Shannon can be significantly beaten, because Shannon assumes gaussian noise, but if we use photon counting receivers we need to use a poisson distribution. This is the Gordon-Holevo limit. To beat Shannon you need PPM formats and photon counters (single photon detectors). One can do significantly better than the numbers from voyager in the article using optics even without photon cpunting. Our group has shown 1 photon/bit at 10 Gbit/s [1] but others have shown even higher sensitivity (albeit at much lower data rates). [1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-020-00389-2 reply aptitude_moo 4 hours agoparentVery interesting, I studied telecommunications and I thought the Shannon limit was the absolute limit. I wonder now if this Gordon Holevo limit is applicable for \"traditional\" telecommunications (like 5G) as opposed to photon counting a deep space probe EDIT: This paper seems to answer my question [1] [1] https://opg.optica.org/directpdfaccess/8711ab35-bbc2-4d51-8e... reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentAs also explained in the conclusion of the paper linked by you, \"photon-counting\" detectors are possible only when the energy of one photon is high enough, which happens only for infrared light or for higher frequencies. \"Photon-counting\" methods cannot be implemented at frequencies so low as used in 5G networks or in any other traditional radio communications. reply stracer 2 hours agorootparentprevCan you please post another link?

That’s what my lab did for microscopy anyway. Saying you’re beating the Shannon limit is like saying you’re beating the second law of thermodynamics to me.. but I could be wrong. reply Sanzig 2 hours agorootparentYou are correct. People often say \"Shannon limit\" (the general case) when they are really referring to the \"Shannon-Hartley Limit\" (the simplified case of an additive white Gaussian noise channel). For example, MIMO appears to \"break\" the Shannon-Hartley limit because it does exceed the theoretical AWGN capacity for a simple channel. However, when you apply Shannon's theory to reformulate the problem for the case of a multipath channel with defined mutual coupling, you find that there is a higher limit you are still bounded by. reply s1dev 28 minutes agorootparentI often wondered why MIMO was such an investigated topic. It would make sense if the Shannon limit is higher for this channel. Is there a foundational paper or review that shows this? reply cycomanic 2 hours agorootparentprevShannon theory assumes Gaussian noise, however in the very low power regime that's just not true. I agree it's unintuitive. Have a look at the Gordon paper I posted earlier. reply sansseriff 1 hour agoparentprevThe Deep Space Optical Communication (Dsoc) between earth and the psyche spacecraft uses large-M PPM for this reason! This mission is currently ongoing. They send optical pulses in one of up to 128 possible time slots, thereby carrying 7 bits each. And each optical pulse on earth may only be received by 5-10 photons. reply stracer 2 hours agoparentprevIs there some fundamental limit to the number of bits per photon that can be communicated via EM radiation? I think it does not exist, because photons aren't all equal, we can use very high frequency and X-ray quantum can probably carry much more information than RF quantum. reply resters 2 hours agorootparentthis is called the Shannon limit. To discern signal from noise, a minimum sample rate of 2x the frequency of the signal is required. A signal is something that can be turned on or off to send a bit. Higher frequencies can carry more data as you infer but the engineering challenges of designing transmitters and receivers create tradeoffs in practical systems. reply ganzuul 1 hour agorootparentIn addition to wavelength EM also has several polarization modes and near/far field characteristics that can carry information. reply resters 1 hour agorootparentCan individual photons be measured for polarization and phase or is there a similar limit that requires more than one photon to do so? I suppose both are relative to some previous polarization or phase? reply ganzuul 1 hour agorootparentprevGood induction to thinking about quantum gravity. reply im3w1l 34 minutes agorootparentprevSend three photons A B C. They arrive at times ta, tb, tc. Compute fraction (tc - tb) / (tb - ta). This can encode any positive real number with arbitrary precision. But clearly you need either very precise measurements or send the photons at a very slow rate. reply nico 4 hours agoparentprevInteresting. Is that related to compressed sensing? I wonder if compress sensing could be used for something like the Voyager signals It seems there might be multiple ways to go beyond Shannon’s limit, depending on what you are trying to do reply cycomanic 4 hours agorootparentI don't think compressed sensing is really extracting more information than Shannon, it simply exploits the fact that the signal we are interested in is sparse so we don't need to sample \"everything\". But this is somewhat outside my area of expertise so my understanding could be wrong. reply nico 3 hours agorootparentMaybe I’m mixing Shannon’s limit with the sampling rate imposed by the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling theorem > Around 2004, Emmanuel Candès, Justin Romberg, Terence Tao, and David Donoho proved that given knowledge about a signal's sparsity, the signal may be reconstructed with even fewer samples than the sampling theorem requires.[4][5] This idea is the basis of compressed sensing … > However, if further restrictions are imposed on the signal, then the Nyquist criterion may no longer be a necessary condition. A non-trivial example of exploiting extra assumptions about the signal is given by the recent field of compressed sensing, which allows for full reconstruction with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Specifically, this applies to signals that are sparse (or compressible) in some domain From: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_samp... reply sunk1st 8 minutes agorootparentIn so many words, Shannon gave a proof showing that - _in general_ - the sample rate of a digital sensor puts an upper bound on the frequency of any signal that sensor is able to detect. Unlike the Nyquist-Shannon theory, compressed sensing is not generally applicable: it requires a sparse signal. As many other optimization techniques, it’s a trade off between soundness and completeness. reply cycomanic 4 hours agoprevFor anyone who is interested in the ultimate limits to communications the seminal paper by Jim Gordon is quite easy to understand even without a physics degree (unlike the Holevo paper IMO). He was incredibly good at writing in an accessible manner (apart from probably being the person who most deserved a Nobel prize but didn't get it). https://doi.org/10.1109%2FJRPROC.1962.288169 reply PeterCorless 2 minutes agoprevI just wanted to chime in with a reminder that though Voyager 1 is speeding away from Sol at a constant velocity because of the Earth's revolution around the sun it can be up to ±1 AU closer or further away, depending on the time of the year. This article is for Voyager 2, but the issue is the same. For a brief moment every year we actually get closer to Voyager 1, then we pivot away in our revolution around the sun and the distance between Earth and Voyager 1 or 2 increases sharply. So distance, when plotted over time, looks like a wobbly line. https://earthsky.org/space/voyager-spacecraft-getting-closer... reply superposeur 4 hours agoprevThe overwhelming loss in this calculation is from the antenna’s radiated energy spreading out over a larger and larger area (despite the directional “gain” factor). I’m wondering: would a probe launched today instead employ a laser to communicate? This would seem to offer many orders of magnitude improvement in the directionality of the signal. reply sunk1st 4 minutes agoparentPerhaps we should consider relaying the signal through a third satellite. reply londons_explore 3 hours agoparentprevThe main challenge is the earth to probe comms for distant probes, since the earth is often very close (in an angular sense) to the sun from the probes perspective, and the sun gives out a lot of black body radiation. However, due to the shape of the black body radiation curve, the sun gives out relatively less microwave radiation than it does visible light, which might outweigh the advantages of more directionality given by using a laser. reply superposeur 3 hours agorootparentOk what about using a maser instead of a laser? reply opwieurposiu 2 hours agorootparentThe big dish antennas do use ruby masers, but not to transmit. The maser is used as the LNA on the receive side. Check out the picture on page 41 of the pdf, clearly this a flux capacitor, mislabeled to deceive us ;) https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/monograph/series10/03_Reid_cha... https://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/amazin... reply superposeur 44 minutes agorootparentCool use of maser for receive. Not having thought this through before, I see now that while a transmit maser may have efficiency advantages, it may not improve directionality relative to a standard parabolic radio transmitter. All methods of producing microwaves will have basically the same diffraction-limited gain for a given “aperture” (dish) size. That darn uncertainty principle! (However, an optical laser would still give way better directionality.) reply jjk166 3 hours agorootparentprevFurther, we're good at building really big radio transceivers here on Earth, we don't have nearly the same technical experience with lasers of that scale. reply sebzim4500 3 hours agorootparentprevPresumably though it would be useful to have a high bandwidth link back to earth even if we had to use conventional microwave transmitters to send data back. We want to download high resolution images/spectrographs whereas we only want to upload code/instructions. reply cycomanic 2 hours agoparentprevAll space agencies have optical comms in their road maps. Largely they are thinking about inter satellite communications (the atmosphere causes significant issues when going back to earth). So the main application is to have some relay satellite that can then transmit to earth via RF. The application is not mainly deep space ropes but Leo or meo satellites, the typically only have very short transit times over the ground stations, so can't get all their measurement data down. By using e.g. a geo relay they can transmit lots of data optically and the geo relay can more slowly transmit the data to earth until the leo satellite comes back in view. reply Out_of_Characte 3 hours agoparentprevThere's several projects for laser-based communication and research. It would also make it really difficult to aim since you can miss your target now. https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-deep-space-optical-comm-... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_A... reply superposeur 3 hours agorootparentInteresting about the JPL program and I’m amazed this prototype was only launched last year! Apparently the answer to comms laser use is “not yet but soon”. reply mordae 1 hour agoparentprevImproving directionality also makes aiming much harder. reply deelowe 3 hours agoparentprevI imagine it'd certainly employ some type of beamforming at the least. reply wongarsu 3 hours agorootparentAssuming you don't need fast steering, is a 3.7m transmitter array doing beamforming really better than a 3.7m dish transmitting at the same power? My intuition would have been that you are better off using a fairly standard transceiver and spending your engineering budget either increasing power or getting a bigger dish (either by launching on a wider rocket or with a folding design). Lasers might interesting for the downlink, but receiving a laser signal on the probe sounds difficult (earth is pretty bright). reply outworlder 1 hour agorootparentThere's some value in getting rid of mechanical devices (or reducing the need to rotate the entire spacecraft). reply cycomanic 1 hour agorootparentprevDiffraction scales inversely proportional to wavelength so you gain significantly by going to optics, i.e. you can use a much smaller aperature in optics. reply jsjohnst 6 hours agoprevDidn’t realize the math would be that straightforward. Is there something the author isn’t taking into account or is that a decent plausible range? reply magicalhippo 4 hours agoparentOne thing that seems missing to me is that while the probe might send 160 bits/sec of useful data, those bits are not sent directly as such[1]: The TMU encodes the high rate data stream with a convolutional code having constraint length of 7 and a symbol rate equal to twice the bit rate (k=7, r=1/2). So the effective symbol rate is 320 baud[2], and thus a factor of two should be included in the calculations from what I can gather. Note that the error correction was changed after Jupiter to use Reed-Solomon[3] (255,223) to lower the effective bit error rate, so effectively I guess the data rate is more like 140 bps.

For the \"how many photons are needed\" question, I agree that 320 baud (i.e., the effective analog bandwidth of 320 Hz) should have been used for the Shannon-Hartley calculations. reply rcxdude 5 hours agoparentprevIt looks like a pretty reasonable order of magnitude estimate to me. Energy arguments tend to be quite neat for that because if the efficiency is at all reasonable they constrain things well with fairly simple calculations. The antenna directionality is also reasonably well understood and characterised. The exact noise level discussed later on is probably where things get a bit more uncertain (but aren't directly needed to answer the question). reply krylon 5 hours agoparentprevI was surprised, too. Knowing little about physics, this was a pleasant surprise, however. reply tb0ne 1 hour agoprevSuper interesting! But I feel like there is a bit of a conclusion missing for me. So 1500 Photons hit the receiver per bit send, but this is obviously way to few to keep processing the signal and it will just be drowned out by noise? Where do we go from here? Does voyager repeat its signal gazillions of times so we can average out the noise on our end? Where can I find more information on what is done with these few photons? reply ziofill 4 hours agoprevWhat a lovely question. The estimate is 10-100 photons/bit (minimum). If you’re curious about how many bits a single photon can carry, in controlled settings (tabletop quantum optics) a single photon can carry log(n) bits where n is the size of the state space of the photon, which theoretically is infinite and in practice it can reach into the hundreds/thousands. reply layer8 4 hours agoparentNo, the estimate is around 750 or 200 photons/bit received, depending on the transmission frequency. The answer to the question is B, not C. Your numbers are the estimated minimum needed, not the actual amount received, which is what the question was asking. reply mnw21cam 4 hours agoparentprevVisible light is different, because each photon has a lot more energy than in the 2.3GHz range. Your average decent consumer-level camera has a sensor that can nominally just about detect single photons some proportion of the time (as in, some of them bounce off instead of being detected) though it can't technically count them. The graininess on digital camera images is more from the Poisson noise of the incoming photons than it is from the applied noise of the sensor itself. reply bandrami 5 hours agoprevIt's crazy to me how many theoretical limits Shannon predicted way before the hardware was there. reply ziofill 4 hours agoparentThat’s because his results are about pure information (and in the limit for infinite string lengths), so sooner or later some hardware will hit onto those limits or tend to them. reply bandrami 4 hours agorootparentAgreed, but: he's still understudied. I think in retrospect any 21st-century math course has to include Shannon, and they don't all, yet. reply sebzim4500 3 hours agorootparentOn some level he's a victim of his own success. He invents information theory in the same paper that proves the most interesting results, so who else will work on it? reply aidenn0 2 hours agorootparentEven the practical work was done surprisingly early. I have a book on error correcting codes from the 1950s and it's missing very little (Most notably trellis codes and LDPC; the former being invented in the '70s and the latter in 1963). reply somat 2 hours agoprevAn interesting thing about photons (which may not be true, I just enjoy this stuff amateurishly, that is, without the effort or rigor to actually understand it.) is that they might not exist. the em field is not quantized, or at least is not quantized at the level of photons. A \"photon\" only exists where the em field interacts with matter, where the electrons that create the disturbance can only pulse in discrete levels. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExhSqq1jysg Not that this changes anything, we can only detect or create light with matter. but it does make me curious about single photon experiments and what they are actually measuring. reply leetrout 1 hour agoparentThanks for the link. I never conceptualized photons outside of the visual spectrum so the headline made me take a step back and get nerd sniped in the process. I stumbled upon this before seeing your comment: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/90646/what-is-th... reply lordnacho 5 hours agoprevI love these kinds of questions. So what does that conclusion mean about when the probe will be so far away that we are below the Shannon limit? And can we beat the Shannon limit somehow, eg collect for longer, put the dish outside the atmosphere, and so on? reply ethbr1 5 hours agoparentNot my field, but assuming transmitting hardware (including beam forming) is constant and that atmosphere can mostly be ignored (see comments about it usually being a non-impact in the transmission frequencies), two approaches would suggest: 1. Increase the effective receiving dish size, to capture more of the signal. Essentially, this would be effective in direct proportion to beam spread (the more beam spread, the bigger dish you can use to capture signal). In practice, this would use multiple geographically-displaced dishes to construct a virtually-larger dish, to allow for better noise-cancellation magic (and at lower cost than one huge dish). I believe the deep space network (DSN) already does this? Edit: It certainly has arrayed antennae [0], though not sure how many are Voyager-tasked. 2. Increase the resilience of the signal, via encoding. The math is talking about bits and photons, but not encoded information. By trading lower bit-efficiency for increased error tolerance (i.e. including redundant information) we can extract a coherent signal even accounting for losses. Someone please point out if I'm wrong, but afaik the Shannon–Hartley limit speaks to \"lower\" in the physical stack than error coding. I.e. one can layer arbitrary error coding on top of it to push limits (at the expense of rate)? If the above understanding is correct, is there a way to calculate maximum signal distance assuming a theoretically maximally efficient error coding (is that a thing?) ? Or is that distance effectively infinite, assuming you're willing to accept an increasingly slow bit receiving rate? [0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network#Ante... reply shagie 5 hours agorootparentThe resilience of the signal part... https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/voyager-mission-annive... > The uplink carrier frequency of Voyager 1 is 2114.676697 MHz and 2113.312500 MHz for Voyager 2. The uplink carrier can be modulated with command and/or ranging data. Commands are 16-bps, Manchester-encoded, biphase-modulated onto a 512 HZ square wave subcarrier. The \"Manchester encoding\" brings us to https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/manchest... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code Note that \"16 bps\" while the system runs at 160 bps. This suggests that the data is repeated ten times and xor'ed with a clock running at 10 HZ. While there's no VOY set up now, https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html will occasionally show it. When that happens, you will likely see two set up for it. I've not seen them set up across multiple facilities - the facilities are 120° apart and only one has a spacecraft above the horizon for any given length of time. --- In the \"sensitivity to photons\" category, I'll also mention https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment... At the Moon's surface, the beam is about 6.5 kilometers (4.0 mi) wide[24][i] and scientists liken the task of aiming the beam to using a rifle to hit a moving dime 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) away. The reflected light is too weak to see with the human eye. Out of a pulse of 3×10^17 photons aimed at the reflector, only about 1–5 are received back on Earth, even under good conditions. They can be identified as originating from the laser because the laser is highly monochromatic. While there's no signal there, we're still looking at very sensitive equipment. reply nsguy 3 hours agorootparentprevTIL from another comment that the Shannon limit assumes Gaussian noise so it's not actually always the theoretical limit. You can't work around the Shannon limit by using encoding. It's the theoretical information content limit. But you can keep reducing the bandwidth and one way of doing that is adding error correction. So intuitively I'd say yes to your question, the distance can go to infinity as long as you're willing to accept an increasingly low receive bit rate. What's less clear to me is whether error correction on its own can be used to approach the Shannon limit for a given S/N ratio - I think the answer is no because you're not able to use the entire underlying bandwidth. But you can still extract a digital signal from noise given enough of a signal... EDIT: There is a generalization of the Shannon limit to non-white Gaussian noise here: https://dsp.stackexchange.com/a/82840 reply retrac 5 hours agorootparentprevThere's another major factor. I suppose it falls under the encoding. Frequency stability. In a certain sense, having an extremely precise oscillator at both the receiver and the transmitter, is the same thing as just having a better more frequency-stable antenna, or less noise in the channel (because you know what the signal you're listening for should look like). I'm no physicist here so take this with a major grain of salt. I think the limit might ultimately arise from the uncertainty principle? Eventually the signal becomes so weak that measuring it, overwhelms the signal. This is why the receiver of space telescopes is cooled down with liquid helium. The thermally-generated background RF noise (black bodies radiate right down into the radio spectrum) would drown everything else out otherwise. Along those lines, while I'm still not quite sure where the limit is, things become discrete at the micro level, and the smallest possible physical state change appears to be discrete in nature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle Enough work physically must occur to induce a state change of some kind at the receiver, or no communication can occur. (But this interpretation is disputed!) reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentCoding counters the uncertainty principle by allowing multiple measurements, which can then be averaged. Thant counters the contribution of random noise. There are practical signals we use every day that are \"below the noise floor\" before we decode them. So while there is an ultimate limit of the maximum coding rate for a given signal-to-noise ratio, this is expressed in terms of a data rate (i.e. bits per second). If you're fine with lowering your data rate, there is no fundamental theoretical limit, as far as I understand. reply RetroTechie 4 hours agorootparentprev3. Use relays. Of course that would mean sending (a) giant receiver dish(es) in the general direction a probe is sent. On the flip side, if using a single relay it could travel at roughly 1/2 the speed of the probe. Note that signal strength weakens with distance^2. So if eg. you'd have 2 relays (1/3 and 2/3 between Earth & the probe), each relay would receive 9x stronger signal. No doubt the 'logistics' (trajectory, gravity assist options, mission cost etc) make this impractical. But it is an option. reply ethbr1 8 minutes agorootparentThat'd be really cool! And definitely helped by the fact that you'd only need to head out at a fraction of Voyagers speeds to get the benefit. There's some details on the Voyager gravity-assist mechanics here [0], but you'd also need the escape trajectory to be pointed in the Voyager direction which would further constrain... That said, Earth-Jupiter-Saturn alignments don't seem that rare (on a decades scale). [0] http://www.gravityassist.com/IAF3-2/Ref.%203-143.pdf reply 7373737373 5 hours agoparentprevIf the current number of photons per bit is 1500 and the effective limit at 8.3GHz is 25, that is a factor of 60. With each doubling of distance the number decreases by the inverse square law, so with the current setup we'd have a maximum distance of log2(60) = 5.9 times the current distance (about 163 astronomical units (AU)) which is 961 AU. In comparison, the closest star to our sun, Proxima Centauri, is 268774 AU away! Which means we would need something 268774/961 ~= 280 times SQUARED = 78222 times more sensitive than the current setup at the Shannon limit to communicate with it if it managed to get that far. reply Symmetry 5 hours agoparentprevThe Shannon Limit is fundamental so you can't get around it directly. But yes, there are things you can do to receive information from further away. 1) A bigger dish is the most obvious one. 2) Use a lower bitrate to send more energy per bit at the same transmitter power. 3) Reduce the effective receiver temperature. This is a case where putting it outside the atmosphere might help in reducing noise. reply mpreda 5 hours agoparentprevMaybe multiple receiving antennas could be used, spaced widely apart (e.g. one on Earth, one on the moon, one in orbit somewhere); each would receive some signal affected by noise, but the noise would be different for each (such as the atmosphere affecting only the on-ground antenna). Also given that we know the precise location of the transmitter, we can work-out the exact phase difference between the antennas. Some digital post-processing would combine the raw signal+noise from the multiple receivers and extract the signal. In fact, I assume that at this distance, even a very narrow signal would spread wide enough to illuminate more than just the Earth diameter. reply kibwen 4 hours agoparentprev> So what does that conclusion mean about when the probe will be so far away that we are below the Shannon limit? I think the practical limit right now is that the Voyagers are losing power. \"The radioisotope thermoelectric generator on each spacecraft puts out 4 watts less each year.

Which works fine for receiving but not so much for transmitting (while there are multiple sites in the world capable of receiving from voyager 2, there's only one dish which can actually transmit to it) (I recall seeing a video on that dish, and the director seemed confident there was enough noise margin left that voyager's power would fail before they lost contact with it) reply hammock 3 hours agoprev>Voyager sends 160 bits/second This makes me wonder, are the bits = the power turned on for exactly 1/320th sec, every 1/160th sec?

What are the pros and cons? reply danbruc 3 hours agoparentWithout looking up what kind of encoding and modulation they are using, I would assume that they are sending a continuous sine wave at the carrier frequency that has the bits - probably after encoding the raw data bits with some error correction code - modulated onto it by changing frequency, amplitude, phase, or a combination of them depending on the value of each bit or group of bits. reply notorandit 6 hours agoprevIt's really nice!

In the earth->Voyager direction it seems even less intuitive - sure we can broadcast a powerful signal, but it's being received by a 12' wide antenna 15 billion miles away. WTF?

It's one of those things that can take a bit to get used to, but everything on the electromagnetic spectrum is just light in the general sense. The only difference between radio-waves, x-rays, infra-red and (human) visible light is the frequency/wavelength. If the frequency is high enough then the waves of light can be detected by things as small as cells in the back of your eye, or the pixels in a camera sensor. If it is too low then you need much larger detectors. Other animals have detectors for different frequencies/wavelengths, allowing them to see either infra-red (mosquitos) or ultraviolet (bees, butterflies etc). What we call \"visible light\" is just the particular range that our eyes can detect (about 400 to 800THz). If we were the size of a planet, and our eye cells were the size of a radio-telescope dish we would be able to \"see\" in those wavelengths. In fact, when we see images taken by radio telescopes, those have been essentially pitch-shifted up to something we can see, like the reverse of what we do when listening for bat clicks (where the pitch is downshifted to our hearing range). The wikipedia article has a nice little diagram putting the wavelengths into perspective. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum reply pcdoodle 4 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply. This makes me think of the dual slit experiment. Does the universe treat everything as a wave to save CPU cycles or something?

One way of thinking of it - everything is a wave until you make a measurement. Then you get a \"collapse\" (localization) of the wavefunction. Which leads to the question of why the wave function collapses - i.e. how does nature know we want to make a measurement. Which leads to all sorts of crazy ideas like the simulation hypothesis.

Giving players so much freedom that they can easily identify and execute a grindy, brute-force but boring strategy is an extremely common problem in game design. Fault is irrelevant, it is the game's problem if the player stops having fun because they got trapped in a psychological pit tying to circumvent the rules when playing by the rules is ultimately easier. This is a tradeoff so requires some balance, but OP's suggestion is simple, unobtrusive, and probably effective. reply cubefox 6 hours agorootparentExactly. That's also the same reason why a game being too easy is the game's fault. One could object that players should be more disciplined and intentionally forego (e.g.) the stronger weapons in the game. But part of the fun of playing the game is to try to get the best possible weapon. Similarly, it is little fun to play e.g. tennis or chess against a weak opponent. Either it is too easy, or you don't give your best, neither of which is particularly fun. reply louthy 6 hours agorootparentprevThe whole purpose of a game is to complete a goal. Good games gamify you to achieving that goal. If the goal is to learn CSS and the game hasn't guided you to achieve that goal then it's failing at its purpose.

CSS Grid was the first specification for page layout using rows and columns (grids) since the creation of the web. Everything else prior was a compromise. Flexbox is for laying out rows or columns; while you can do some limited page layout, that's not what it's designed for. Just like tables and floats weren't designed for page layout either. Another way to grok this: CSS Grid is for two dimensional layout and Flexbox is for one dimensional layout.

You can use flexbox for these, but the treatment of wrapping items in non-full rows was always a point of frustration for me.

    "originLink": "https://popovicu.com/posts/making-usb-devices/",
    "originBody": "Follow @popovicu94 Today we’ll build some USB devices. By this I mean devices that can be plugged into your computer and be recognized by them. The goal of this writeup is to be your first article to read when embarking on developing USB devices. A small disclaimer first: I do not consider myself an expert on USB. Please don’t consider this some sort of an authoritative guide, think of it more as a documentation of my little project towards building the simplest possible E2E USB device. It’s also an index to some really good material that other people have made that goes into a lot of detail. Table of contents Open Table of contents Background I’m sure I don’t need to explain why USB devices are useful. They’re all around us and our daily computers have plenty of USB ports. Even if they don’t, USB hubs can open up the possibility of more ports. This is where we plug in various devices that extend the capabilities of our machines. I’ll refer to these USB devices simply as devices, while referring to the machines we’re extending as hosts. The goal of this article is to give you the simplest end-to-end journey to a working USB device. We’ll cover everything from the physical connection between the USB device and the host, and developing a super sample application that interacts with our USB device (from the host). What is USB? Let’s cover first what exactly is USB, and for that, I’ll quote the first paragraph from Wikipedia: Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics. It specifies its architecture, in particular its physical interface, and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from hosts, such as personal computers, to and from peripheral devices, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediate hubs, which multiply the number of a host’s ports. The rest of this article will unpack this description piece by piece. To begin, though, we need to know first and foremost that USB is a serial bus. Bits go onto the bus one by one, in contrast to parallel buses. I don’t recall seeing a parallel bus for decades now. The last time I saw a parallel bus was to connect a hard disk to the motherboard with a ribbon cable. Those are outdated now, and modern buses are primarily serial. Again, this means bits go one by one, rather than in parallel. I won’t get into the details of this (mainly because I’m not an expert myself) — my understanding is that simply it’s really hard to make parallel transmission work efficiently in this context, so simple protocols end up in more elegant and faster devices. This mental model doesn’t capture nearly all the complexities, but still gives us enough to get started with USB: this is a way to exchange bits serially between the host and the device. However, USB is more than just a spec on how to connect two devices and send bits back and forth. It also, per the quote above, captures some parts of the communication protocol. Let’s start unpacking, and we’ll focus on USB 2.0. USB wires You’ve likely seen different kinds of USB plugs and cables, but they all boil down to the same thing. Inside the connection are the wires to provide power from host to the device and to transfer the bits back and forth. Let’s focus on the typical USB 2.0 connection, these are the wires you’ll see inside: +5 V wire, this is where the device gets its power from, if powering from the host. D- and D+ wires: I lump them together as one item here, since they jointly work to transfer 1 bit (not 2!) as a differential pair. Much more info on that below. GND wire: unsurprisingly, this is ground. Some connections may have a few more pins, like the ID pin, but since this is the bare minimal writeup on USB, let’s skip that now. We’ll be working only with the 4 wires described above. A note on USB-C USB-C is super common these days. What I wrote above for the USB wires still somewhat applies to USB-C, but it’s slightly different in that case. One of the main differences, obviously, is the fact that you can plug a USB-C device either way and things should work. At the core of it, there’s still a differential pair. Let’s just focus on one very important thing here: if a device connects via USB-C, it still doesn’t mean anything when it comes to the speed, or even which USB version it is. It could still be a USB 2.0 device, or it could be a more modern USB 3.0 device. With that out of the way, we won’t be discussing USB-C anymore here. Data over a differential pair If you’ve never seen differential pairs before, then having 2 wires somehow transmitting 1 bit may stump you. In the most basic computer architecture course, you learn that you only need one wire to signal a digital bit. The wire’s voltage (or should I say potential?), in relation to the ground (point of 0 volts) signals what is the value of the bit. If you’re playing with something like Raspberry Pi, you know that if you set a GPIO pin to logical 1, it gives you 3.3 V, 0 V otherwise. And this is fine over something like super short distances, within a chip, or even within small traces on the PCB. However, we frequently have a need for longer distance wired connections. Your keyboard and mouse are at least a few feet away from your computer, for example. This is where the differential pairs come in. Instead of having one wire at voltage V, in relation to GND, we now have two wires. One is still at voltage V, while the other one is the polar opposite at -V. When a differential pair comes out of one component into the other, what the other component considers is the voltage difference between these two wires. V - (-V) = 2V. There seems to be little benefit in this — we just got double the voltage we otherwise would, and that’s true in this model; however this model doesn’t paint the whole picture. We assumed our wires carry our voltage perfectly. Let’s mark the voltages of these wires as V+ and V-. If we use a more realistic model, V+ isn’t simply equal to V, it’s equal to V plus some voltage noise, let’s mark it as Vn. Therefore V+ = V + Vn. Now, V- is similarly V- = -V + Vn. This time, when we calculate what the other device sees, it’s V+ - V- = (V + Vn) - (-V + Vn) = 2V. The voltage noise is gone! Now it’s a little clearer what the benefits of the differential pairs are. Of course, this is a mega simplified view of things. For example, why do we treat the noise factor as the same for both wires here? For a more serious introduction to differential pairs, I’d recommend Zach Peterson’s videos on Altium YouTube channel, starting from this one: Now it should be clearer why I lumped D+ and D- wires above as one item: these two wires carry one bit at the time. It should also be clearer why they’re identified as D, and what is plus and what is minus. USB on a PCB If you don’t intend to make your own hardware for a USB device and instead want to use some existing development board, you can skip this altogether, but I’d still recommend quickly scanning through it. When you add a USB connector to your PCB from some library, you should see the pins that I listed above, and you can route accordingly. Your PCB may have a microcontroller, or a more complex SoC onboard, and you’ll definitely need to run the differential pair to the relevant two neighboring pins on the chip. For routing differential pairs, there are a couple of basic things to keep in mind. First, the trace from the D+ pin on your USB connector to the plus pin for the differential pair on your chip should be of same length as the other trace for the differential pair. Second, these traces should be very close to each other. For a graphical example, please check out this article, the graphic at the top should quickly illustrate what I’m talking about (again, great article by Zach Peterson). These two principles should explain a little bit why in our (still simplistic) calculation, we assumed that the noise in our voltage is the same. The two wires are running in almost identical context and that’s how the noise ends up cancelling. Third, and this is potentially very important, we should have a certain impedance for the signals. The calculations here are very complex and many factors go in. I recommend watching the following video for an introduction here: tl;dr is that you’ll go to your fabricator’s website, put some parameters into the calculator, and it will calculate the missing parameters. For example, you’ll specify your target impedance for the differential pair running above a layer of ground plane, specify the distance between your differential pair lines, etc. and it will provide you with the trace width you should use in order to achieve that impedance. I’ll link below to another great video by Zach Peterson about USB routing, but I think if you’re just getting started, the one above should be enough: Different speeds of USB We said initially we’re focusing on USB 2.0, but that still doesn’t fully tell us what’s the speed we’re reaching here. Even within the same USB version, we can have different speed levels. For example, you can run USB 2.0 at full speed, which is 12 Mbit/s, but you could also run it at high speed, which is 480 Mbit/s. The device and the host need to figure out what’s the speed they’ll be utilizing when they connect. A quick note on the speeds over PCB Again, you can skip this if you aren’t making your own PCB, but it still makes sense to try to parse through this, it could be useful. While there seem to be many requirements for correctly routing USB over the PCB, the hardware you’re connecting on both ends, the host and the chip in your device, can be fairly forgiving, especially if you’re not going for the high speed (and at full speed, 12 Mbit/s should be more than enough for a basic prototype). One of the big things about reaching high speeds is hitting the right impedance. Lots of thought needs to go into this, but from my understanding, if you’re going for full speed, you can get away with a lot (and we will in our working example below!). The trace widths don’t matter all that much, especially if your traces are short from the USB connector to your chip. Protocol and software layers I think so far we’ve covered a decent chunk of hardware, and we should discuss what about the protocol itself and how does software (on both sides) use USB. I’ll go ahead and simply recommend watching this video: This video talks about USB from the Linux perspective, which is great, but we still haven’t covered Linux here. That said, the video also covers USB broadly, and is pretty well packed into ~45 minutes of content. For the purposes of this article, I’d recommend watching until the Linux example. There’s a lot of background on what the USB frames look like, how there are different endpoints involved and so on. There’s a great bit on configurations and how one device can fulfill multiple USB functionalities. I think if there is one thing to take away from that video, it’s to think about USB as a network of devices, and try to understand that. I won’t try to reproduce any of the details here, I highly recommend watching the video. USB device classes and how hosts use them Hosts obviously need drivers in order to abstract away the hardware and handle the interaction with their components. However, it would be unreasonable to expect that different kernels have drivers implemented for every single USB device. Instead, operating systems recognize different classes of devices. Some classes are mass storage devices (probably the most common everyday use case), some are serial devices, and so on. Therefore, there is some level of uniformity across devices here. In our example below, we’ll build a sample device that’s simply a serial port from the host’s perspective. Building a serial port device Our device will be very simple — we will have a USB-capable microcontroller that is powered by the host and serves the host by simply turning on an LED when requested. The host will see this device as a simple serial port device. I see two main approaches in this kind of scenario: use a microcontroller or a Linux-ready SoC. In the latter case, the kernel itself can do a bulk of work and offer you a very clean Linux API for the functionality, but that is an overkill for this simple use case, and we’ll stick with the microcontroller. I’ll do a reflection on the state of software for this kind of a use case below. STM32 microcontroller and the Nucleo board We’re opting for the first approach, which is using a USB-ready microcontroller and our development board of choice is NUCLEO-F103RB. In the US, it can be bought on something like Digikey for a little over $10. When you look at this board, you can clearly see it consists of 2 pieces spliced together. The connection is almost like a perforation, and I’ve seen some videos on YouTube where people literally break this board in two along that connection by hand. I wouldn’t do it, though. The smaller piece is the microcontroller programmer. This is where the USB connection with the computer also lies and that’s how you’ll be programming the board. Be careful though, that’s not the USB connection we’re looking for here, and this may stump you right now. To be fully perfectly precise, there are 2 big chips on this Nucleo board. One lies on the programmer piece of the PCB, and the other one is the microcontroller you’re actually programming, and it lies on the bigger piece. The USB connection your computer establishes with the board is actually with the microcontroller on the programmer side. This programmer speaks the ST-LINK protocol, which to the best of my understanding, is just a protocol built on top of USB messaging. Your computer and the programmer MCU will exchange USB messages according to the ST-LINK protocol, and then that MCU will program your “main” MCU. How that happens on this board, I don’t know, nor should it matter for our experiment. It could happen over something like SPI, as far as we’re concerned, or maybe they could even have their own USB connection between themselves, who knows. If you were to build your own PCB with an STM32 microcontroller, you could place one chip on the board, program it over USB and later use the same USB port for business logic between your device and the USB host. I’ll link to two videos from Phil’s Lab (fantastic materials) on building STM32-based PCBs, as well as how to do programming on these over USB. The first one is 20 minutes only, and absolutely worth your time. Setting up the actual USB port Now that we’ve established that the USB connection we have on the Nucleo board indeed isn’t connected to the chip that we’re actually programming, we need to figure out a way to get that USB port from the “main” chip to work. In this exercise, once we program the chip, we’ll disconnect the ST-LINK programmer piece from the computer, and power our main chip from the “real” USB port instead. Below is how we do it, step by step. We’ll be using STM32CubeIDE to write the software, and then use STM32CubeProgrammer to drop that software onto the board, in order to keep things simple. The first thing we need to do is identify which pins on the MCU are able to work as the USB port. We’re making a USB 2.0 device, keeping things simple, and this is what we need: A pin to supply 5 V power from the host device. GND pin. D+ and D- pins that can handle the USB differential pair data. GND is trivial, and so should be the 5 V power. The only detail regarding powering this board over the “proper” USB port is that you need to change the pins on jumper JP5 in order to configure the board to accept “external 5 V” supply. Check the board documentation for more details, but this is really all I had to do. With that, we’ve taken care of 2 pins. In your STM32CubeIDE app, you should configure (through the UI) PA12 to act as USB_DP and PA11 to act as USB_DM (+ and -, respectively, of course). The end result should look like this: Now, one important thing to note is that the chip on this board will expect an external 1.5 kΩ resistor to be present in the circuit for the USB connection to work. To make this simple, I just bought a pack of 1.5 kΩ resistors from Amazon (not the cheapest solution, though). That resistor should be pulling up the pin PA12 to 3.3 V, which you can also find on the Nucleo board. I used a breadboard to wire this up, so nothing fancy is required. Now that we have identified these 4 pins on the board (plus the 3.3 V for pull-up) and flipped the power supply jumper, we’re ready to make the physical connection to the host. In my case, this is a MacBook Pro running Mac OS. To be able to connect my MacBook to these individual pins, I used a breakout cable from Amazon. For this particular cable that I linked, I popped off the terminal blocks (it’s all modular) and instead got the USB pins exposed. There were 5 pins, but you can ignore the S pin for this exercise. After that, I used regular jumper wires to connect these pins to my Nucleo board, as well as the breadboard where I handled the pull-up for the PA12 pin. I’d like to quickly point back to all the previous notes about length matching with differential pairs, impedance control and so on — as you can see, we’re super relaxed here, and we will be able to achieve the 12 Mbit/s connection regardless. This is what I meant when I said that the devices can be pretty forgiving, at least at some speed. We’re now wired up and ready to go! Writing the software Once you set up the USB pins in CubeIDE, you’ll get some notifications about the clock set up — go for the option where CubeIDE takes care of it for you, it should be able to fix things up. There are a few things to set up for the software part of the USB left. In Pinout & Configuration section, you will see a sub-menu called Middleware and Software Packs. In there, you should see a USB_DEVICE option, so let’s open that. What really matters for this exercise is to set up the mode of the device to: Communication Device Class (Virtual Port Com) This will ensure that your Nucleo board behaves as a serial port device (CDC) from the host perspective. Thus, your host will be able to set up the correct drivers in order to work with your custom device. At this point, CubeIDE will also generate some C code in your program. In my main.c file, I see a line that says: MX_USB_DEVICE_Init(); For a more step-by-step guide on all this, if the above wasn’t enough, please take a look at this video: We’ll do pretty much the same thing as in this video, in order to enable turning on of the LED (we’ll skip turning off in this exercise). The CDC_Receive_FS routine will have this snippet: /* USER CODE BEGIN 6 */ if (Buf[0] == '1') {HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, 1); } This call to the HAL layer will switch on the onboard LED, which is connected to pin 5 of port A. Flashing and running You can go ahead and build the ELF file and use the CubeProgrammer to drop the code bytes onto the board. Once that is done, you can unplug the programmer and wire the board as we described above, powering it from “external 5 V” supply. Once your board powers on, you should be able to see it in whatever device manager your operating system has. Unless you’re running something extremely exotic, I would expect your operating system to be able to recognize the device. In the USB section of your device manager, you should see something like a “COM port”, or a “Serial port” or something along those lines. If you want to be extra cool, you can go back to CubeIDE, head over to the USB_DEVICE menu for the middleware where we previously set up the CDC class for our microcontroller software, and take a look at the bottom section. There, you are able to change the values in the Device Descriptor section, and set up a custom name for your device. That would be reflected in your operating system’s device manager. And for the fun part, you need to connect to your serial port and send byte ‘1’ to make the LED flip on. On my Mac OS, I can find my new device under the /dev filesystem tree. It’s listed on my machine as /dev/tty.usbmodem497A0F6739561. If you’re on Linux, you should get something similar. You may see it listed as /dev/ttyUSB0 or something like that. I’ll use Minicom to talk to this serial device, but you can do pretty much anything here, as long as it works with the serial ports on your device. I run something like this: minicom --device /dev/tty.usbmodem497A0F6739561 At this point, I can simply tap the number ‘1’ on my keyboard, and the green LED on the Nucleo board should go green. Conclusion We’ve basically built a USB serial port device from scratch, and it’s recognized (hopefully) by any mainstream operating system. There’s a bit of theory in the beginning regarding building the PCBs that can do this, and I hope that was helpful as well. I mentioned that from the software perspective, high level, there are 2 approaches: use a microcontroller or with a more complex system, let something like Linux kernel handle the software on the device side. The first approach was simpler for this exercise, but I will highlight that I’m not a huge fan of how things are with STM32 here. This is mostly from a software engineering perspective, and I feel more comfortable sharing my opinions here, given that my professional background is mostly in software engineering. For a start, I don’t like how we have to generate a ton of boilerplate with the IDE after clicking through the UI menus. I wish that we had a library that was more flexible and parameterized in code, so that we can have something like InitUsbDevice(UsbClass.CDC), instead of going through the UIs to generate the code. There’s also a lot of boilerplate with STM32, and it’s very tightly coupled with the user code. In my view, this makes code reviews very difficult. Additionally, how exactly do we update all this boilerplate when a new version is out? This seems a bit like an afterthought with the CubeIDE, and it’s not unheard of in the embedded world. I’ve read some research that says that an overwhelming majority of the embedded devices never see a software update (this can make a lot of software engineers recoil as they read it). There are also other things that are tricky here, for example, what if one day we wanted to change our microcontroller for something different? We’re super tied into the STM32 world with this current set up. There’s a reason why I mentioned Linux being able to act as a USB device — I believe that’s a much cleaner approach. The Linux APIs are much more solid and standardized. Things with Linux would be based on interactions with the pseudo-files and some system calls. The user space is very cleanly separated from the kernel space. Additionally, I think of Linux as the HAL layer. If our microcontroller could run Linux, we’d see a very nice view of all these devices and there wouldn’t be a need for wonky HAL libraries and so on. That said, obviously, sometimes we want lightweight and cheap USB devices that are easy to produce. Linux SoCs are more heavyweight, obviously, and may be an overkill for a lot of use cases. I guess my main point here is that I wish there were more portable and less opinionated frameworks for building bare metal USB devices than what’s available out there. There are things that drive me away from some of them that may be widely accepted: things like frameworks dictating a particular build system that should be used, etc. All this may or may not be a big deal for your project, it’s ultimately for you to decide. I hope I’ll have some time in the near future to play around with this other variation, using Linux itself as the way to implement software on the USB device side, but that’s for another day. For now, let’s enjoy starting up our first custom USB devices that can cleanly integrate with our standard everyday machines like our laptops. As always, I hope this was useful.

One of the things I often saw problems with was the inrush current test. Basically too much bypass caps on the 5v. I didn't see it mentioned in the article. It's really easy to get focused on the high speed digital design but for compliance it's sometimes the less sexy stuff that gets you. No idea how this stuff works with newer versions of the standard but it seems like there still is a test. Nice article though. https://compliance.usb.org/index.asp?UpdateFile=Electrical#:.... reply AdamH12113 26 minutes agoprevIve written bare-metal USB code on an MCU before, and I found it to be quite a shock compared to simple digital protocols like SPI or I2C. The physical and data link layers aren't much more complicated than, say, CAN, but beyond that you immediately run into a brick wall of descriptors, endpoints, and driver configuration. USB was designed from the ground up to be a plug-and-play ecosystem for PCs, and it really shows. Using the vendor-provided software as much as possible is definitely the way to go if you can. Some half-remembered hints: You want bulk transfers for high throughput (don't even look at isochronous). USB is a master/slave protocol so if you're not getting peak throughput it's usually due to something on the host (PC) side. If the license (LGPL) is compatible with your needs, libusb is pretty easy to use. If you're not using the vendor driver, a hardware USB protocol analyzer is really helpful. USB in a NutShell[1] is a decent web reference for understanding the protocol.

Another issue is differential pairs - having designed several working USB boards myself, this has not a concern for beginners, mainly relevant for doing high-speed work.

Many MCUs will also need series resistors between the USB PHY pins and the connector. Will you need to respin a board because you needed to use a 20 mil trace instead of 24 mil? Probably not.

(Dunno which stm32 you're talking about, but stm32g4 is only full speed.) reply jmole 1 hour agorootparentA single BULK USB endpoint can only support 64 bytes per transfer. You could make use of multiple endpoints (8 are available in total) or switch to isochronous endpoints which can support up to 1023 bytes per frame. Most hardware support for isochronous transfers requires DMA on the MCU side, so it tends to be a pain unless your vendor has a library that handles it for you. You can in general send up to 19 bulk transfers in a single frame (even on a single endpoint), but again, vendor libraries differ wildly in their support for this. reply AdamH12113 49 minutes agorootparentNote that isochronous transfers require kernel-mode drivers on the host side, so you won't be able to use libusb in that case. Bulk transfers are the way to go if you want high throughput. reply the__alchemist 37 minutes agorootparentIsn't the restriction just on the reception side? So, if you have a MCU talking to a PC or another MCU, you can send however many bytes you want, but not receive? I say this because A: The Reference Manual only indicates this limit for reception, and B: I only experienced this on reception: PCs seem capable of sending and receiving messages larger than 64-bytes, and STM32s seem capable of sending messages larger than 64-bytes, but not receiving (without isosynchronous, or anything special) reply the__alchemist 1 hour agorootparentprevG4 indeed!

The only important differences in throughput between Intel and AMD were for the 512-bit load and store instructions from the L1 cache and for the 512-bit fused multiply-add instructions, where Intel had double throughput in its more expensive models of server CPUs. I interpret AMD's announcement that now Zen 5 has a double transfer throughput between the 512-bit registers and the L1 cache and also a double 512-bit FP multiplier, so now it matches the Intel AVX-512 throughput per clock cycle in all important instructions. reply Aardwolf 10 hours agorootparent> There is no difference between Intel and AMD Zen 4 for most 512-bit AVX-512 instructions.

As you say, Intel has abandoned the use of the full AVX-512 instruction set in their laptop/desktop products and in some of their server products. At the end of 2025, Intel is expected to introduce laptop/desktop CPUs that will implement a 256-bit subset of the AVX-512 instruction set. While that will bring many advantages of AVX-512 that are not related to register and instruction widths, it will lose the simplification of the high-performance programs that is possible in 512-bit AVX-512 due to the equality between register size and cache line size, so the consumer Intel CPUs will remain a worse target for the implementation of high-performance algorithms. reply BeeOnRope 5 hours agorootparent> of the high-performance programs that is possible in 512-bit AVX-512 due to the equality between register size and cache line size, so the consumer Intel CPUs will remain a worse target for the implementation of high-performance algorithms. Can you elaborate here? I love full-width AVX-512 as much as the next SIMD nerd, but I rarely considered the alignment of the cache line and vector width one of the particularly useful features. If anything, it was a sign that AVX-512 was probably the end of the road for full-throughput full-width loads and stores at full AVX register width, since double-cache line memory operations are likely to be half-throughput at best and a doubling of the cache line width seems unlikely. reply celrod 11 minutes agorootparentI read that comment as \"the wider, the sweeter\" (which I agree with), but that we're now (as you say) at the end of the road, and thus the sweetest point.

The whole intel instruction support story feels garbage here. Weren't they the ones to introduce this whole 512 thing in the first place? reply shrubble 3 hours agorootparentMy view is that Intel is trying to do market segmentation. Want AVX512? You need to buy the \"pro\" lineup of CPUs... reply wtallis 2 hours agorootparentThat's being very generous to Intel. It's much more believable that the strategy of mixing performance and efficiency cores in mainstream consumer processors starting with Alder Lake was a relatively last-minute decision, too late to re-work the Atom core design to add AVX512, so they sacrificed it from the performance cores instead. The Intel consumer processors due out later this year are expected to include the first major update to their efficiency cores since they introduced Alder Lake. Only after that ships without AVX512 will it be plausible to attribute product segmentation as a major cause rather than just engineering factors. (Intel's AVX10 proposal indicates their long-term plan may be to never support 512-bit SIMD on the efficiency cores, but to eventually make it possible for full 512-bit SIMD to make a return to their consumer processors.) reply tempnow987 2 hours agorootparentprevNo question - but these kind of games lead to poor adoption. They made a big todo about how much better than AMD they are with things like AVX512. Then they play these games for market purposes. Then they have stupid clock speed pauses, so when you try it your stuff goes slower. Meanwhile - AMD is putting it on all their chips and it works reasonably there. So I've just found the whole Intel style here kind of annoying. I really remember them doing bogus comparisons to non AVX-512 AMD parts (and projecting when their chips would be out).

Can someone explain the clock speed drop? reply adrian_b 8 hours agorootparentA clock speed drop must always occur whenever a CPU does more work per clock cycle, e.g. when more CPU cores are active or when wider SIMD instructions are used. However the early generations of Intel CPUs that have implemented AVX-512 had bad clock management, which was not agile enough to lower quickly the clock frequency, i.e. the power consumption, when the temperature was too high due to higher power consumption, in order to protect the CPU. Because of that and because there are no instructions that the programmers could use to announce their intentions of using intensively wide SIMD instructions in a sequence of code, the Intel CPUs lowered the clock frequency preemptively and a lot, whenever they feared that the future instruction stream might contain 512-bit instructions that could lead to an overtemperature. The clock frequency was restored only after delays not much lower than a second. When AVX-512 instructions were executed sporadically, that could slow down any application very much. The AMD CPUs and the newer Intel CPUs have better clock management, which reacts more quickly, so the low clock frequency during AVX-512 instruction execution is no longer a problem. A few AVX-512 instructions will not lower measurably the clock frequency, while the low clock frequency when AVX-512 instructions are executed frequently is compensated by the greater work done per clock cycle. reply camel-cdr 12 hours agoparentprevAVX512 was never over 2 cycles. In Zen4 it used the 256 wide execution units of avx2 (except for shuffle), but there are more then one 256-bit wide execution units, so you still got your one cycle throughput. reply dzaima 5 hours agorootparentMore importantly for the \"2 cycles\" question, Zen 4 can get one cycle latency for double-pumped 512-bit ops (for the ops where that's reasonable, i.e. basic integer/bitwise arith). Having all 512-bit pipes would still be a massive throughput improvement over Zen 4 (as long as pipe count is less than halved), if that is what Zen 5 actually does; things don't stop at 1 op/cycle.

And Zen 4 already has a throughput of 2 FP ops/cycle for up to 256-bit arguments. The thing discussed is that Zen 4 does 512-bit SIMD ops via splitting them into two 256-bit ones, whereas Zen 5 supposedly will have hardware doing all 512 bits at a time. reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentEven if Lisa Su said this at the Zen 4 launch, it is not likely that 512-bit operations are split into a pair of 256-bit operantions that are executed sequentially in the same 256-bit execution unit. Both Zen 3 and Zen 4 have four 256-bit execution units. Two 512-bit instructions can be initiated per clock cycle. It is likely that the four corresponding 256-bit micro-operations are executed simultaneously in all the 4 execution units, because otherwise there would be an increased likelihood that the dispatcher would not be able to find enough micro-operations ready for execution so that no execution unit remains idle, resulting in reduced performance. The main limitation of the Zen 4 execution units is that only 2 of them include FP multipliers, so the maximum 512-bit throughput is one fused multiply-add plus one FP addition per clock cycle, while the Intel CPUs have an extra 512-bit FMA unit, which stays idle and useless when AVX-512 instructions are not used, but which allows two 512-bit FMA per cycle. Without also doubling the transfer path between the L1 cache and the registers, a double FMA throughput would not have been beneficial for Zen 4, because many algorithms would have become limited by the memory transfer throughput. Zen 5 doubles the width of the transfer path to the L1 and L2 cache memories and it presumably now includes FP multipliers in all the 4 execution units, thus matching the performance of Intel for 512-bit FMA operations, while also doubling the throughput of the 256-bit FMA operations, where in Intel CPUs the second FMA unit stays unused, halving the throughput. No well-designed CPU has a FP addition or multiplication latency of 1. All modern CPUs are designed for the maximum clock frequency which ensures that the latency of operations similar in complexity with 64-bit integer additions between registers is 1. (CPUs with a higher clock frequency than this are called \"superpipelined\", but they have went out of fashion a few decades ago.) For such a clock frequency, the latency of floating-point execution units of acceptable complexity is between 3 and 5, while the latency of loads from the L1 cache memory is about the same. The next class of operations with a longer latency includes division, square root and loads from the L2 cache memory, which usually have latencies between 10 and 20. The longest latencies are for loads from the L3 cache memory or from the main memory. reply dzaima 2 hours agorootparentYeah, it's certainly possible that it's not double-pumping. Should be roughly possible to test via comparing latency upon inserting a vandpd between two vpermd's (though then there are questions about bypass networks; and of course if we can't measure which method is used it doesn't matter for us anyway); don't have a Zen 4 to test on though. But of note is that, at least in uops.info's data[0], there's one perf counter increment per instruction, and all four pipes get non-zero equally-distributed totals, which seems to me much simpler to achieve with double-pumping (though not impossible with splitting across ports; something like incrementing a random one. I'd expect biased results though). Then again, Agner says \"512-bit vector instructions are executed with a single μop using two 256-bit pipes simultaneously\".

They're also re-using CPU's IO die from last generation and re-using the same chipset silicon, which further constrains them to only minor tweaks. Typical use cases and motherboards give an x16 slot for graphics, x4 each to at least one or two M.2 slots for SSDs, and x4 to the chipset. Last generation and this generation, AMD's high-end chipset is actually two chipsets daisy-chained, since they're really not much more than PCIe fan-out switches plus USB and SATA HBAs. Nobody allocates a single PCIe lane to an SSD slot, and the link between the CPU and chipset must have a lane width that is a power of two; a seven-lane link is not possible with standard PCIe. Also, keep in mind that PCIe is packet-switched, so even though on paper the chipset is over-subscribed with downstream ports that add up to more bandwidth than the uplink to the CPU provides, it won't be a bottleneck unless you have an unusual hardware configuration and workload that actually tries to use too much IO bandwidth with the wrong set of peripherals simultaneously. reply dhx 11 hours agorootparentThanks for the description. The article was confusing as to whether the CPU's stated 24x PCIe 5.0 lanes included those required for the chipset. Given that the same AM5 socket is used and X870E is similar to the X670E, this appears to not be the case, and instead the 9950X would have 28x PCIe 5.0 lanes, 4 of which are connected to the daisy-chained chipset and 24 then remain available to the motherboard vendor (nominally as 16 for graphics, 8 for NVMe). I also hadn't realised the CPU would offer 4x USB 4.0 ports directly. Block diagram for AM5 (X670E/X670): https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-7950x/images/...

It's sort of an unfortunate artifact of the way server platforms have gone that HEDT has fizzled out, they're mostly just too big and it isn't that practical to fit into commodity form-factors anymore, etc. a bigass socket sp3 and 8ch was already quite big, now it's 12ch for SP5 and you have a slightly smaller one at SP6. But still, doing 1DPC in a commodity form factor is difficult, you really need an EEB sort of thing for things like GENOAD8X etc let alone 2 dimms per channel etc, which if you do like a 24-stick board and a socket you don't fit much else. https://www.anandtech.com/show/20057/amd-releases-epyc-8004-... 2011/2011-3/2066 were actually a reasonable size. Like LGA3678 or whatever as a hobbyist thing doesn't seem practical (the W-3175X stuff) and that was also 6ch, and Epyc/TR are pretty big too etc. There used to exist this size-class of socket that really no longer gets used, there aren't tons of commercial 3-4-6 channel products made anymore, and enthusiast form-factors are stuck in 1980 and don't permit the larger sockets to work that well. The C266 being able to tap off IOs as SAS3/12gbps or pcie 4.0 slimsas is actually brilliant imo, you can run SAS drives in your homelab without a controller card etc. The Asrock Rack ones look sick, EC266D4U2-2L2Q/E810 lets you basically pull all of the chipset IO off as 4x pcie 4.0x4 slimsas if you want. And actually you can technically use MCIO retimers to pull the pcie slots off, they had a weird topology where you got a physical slot off the m.2 lanes, to allow 4x bifurcated pcie 5.0x4 from the cpu. 8x nvme in a consumer board, half in a fast pcie 5.0 tier and half shared off the chipset. https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=E... Wish they'd do something similar with AMD and mcio preferably, like they did with the GENOAD8X. But beyond the adapter \"it speaks SAS\" part is super useful for homelab stuff imo. AMD also really doesn't make that much use of the chipset, like, where are the x670E boards that use 2 chipsets and just sling it all off as oculink or w/e. Or mining-style board weird shit. Or forced-bifurcation lanes slung off the chipset into a x4x4x4x4 etc. https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=G... All-flash is here, all-nvme is here, you just frustratingly can't address that much of it per system, without stepping up to server class products etc. And that's supposed to be the whole point of the E series chipset, very frustrating. I can't think of many boards that feel like they justify the second chipset, and the ones that \"try\" feel like they're just there to say they're there. Oh wow you put 14 usb 3.0 10gbps ports on it, ok. How about some thunderbolt instead etc (it's because that's actually expensive). Like tap those ports off in some way that's useful to people in 2024 and not just \"16 sata\" or \"14 usb 3.0\" or whatever. M.2 NVMe is \"the consumer interface\" and it's unfortunately just about the most inconvenient choice for bulk storage etc. Give me the AMD version of that board where it's just \"oops all mcio\" with x670e (we don't need usb4 on a server if it drives up cost). Or a miner-style board with infinite x4 slots linked to actual x4s. Or the supercarrier m.2 board with a ton of M.2 sticks standing vertically etc. Nobody does weird shit with what is, on paper, a shit ton of pcie lanes coming off the pair of chipsets. C'mon. Super glad USB4 is a requirement for X870/X870E, thunderbolt shit is expensive but it'll come down with volume/multisourcing/etc, and it truly is like living in the future. I have done thunderbolt networking and moved data ssd to ssd at 1.5 GB/s.

Their TDP is more of an aspiration than a reality (ironically, Intel seems to have gotten more accurate with their new base and turbo power ratings). 9700x runs 100MHz higher on the same process as the 7700x. If they are actually running at full speed, I don't see how 9700x could possibly be using less power with more transistors at a higher frequency. They could get lower power for the same performance level though if they were being more aggressive about ramping down the frequency (but it's a desktop chip, so why would they?). reply ComputerGuru 3 hours agorootparentI know AMD has joined the “fudging the TDP numbers” game but you should still be able to more or less compare TDP across their own products. reply hajile 3 hours agorootparentFor the same node, you aren't cutting power by 40% while increasing clockspeeds.

Yes, competition drives innovation. When Ryzen APUs only had Intel to worry about, they rested on their laurels with stagnating but still superior performance.

Framing the distinction between a highly integrated SoC-based computer and a traditional motherboard+AIB arrangement as a quantitative rather than a qualitative difference is an error. Both Intel and AMD have already received Apple's wakeup call and have adjusted their strategies. I also think it's unfair to say that nothing has changed until just now. I consider Ryzen 6000 to be an understated milestone in this competition with a big uplift in iGP performance and a focus on efficiency.

In general, CPU clock speeds stagnated about 20 years ago because we hit a power wall. In 1985, the state of the art was maybe 15-20MHz; in 1995, that was 300-500MHz; in 2005, we hit about 3GHz and we've made incremental progress from there. It turns out that you can only switch voltages across transistors so many times a second before you melt down the physical chip; reducing voltage and current helps but at the expense of stability (quantum tunneling is only becoming a more significant source of leakage as we continue shrinking process sizes). Most of the advancements over the past 20 years have come from pipelining, increased parallelism, and changes further up the memory hierarchy. > today, the latest $1600 Macbook Pro comes with.... 8GB of RAM. That's an unfair comparison. Apple has a history of shipping less RAM with its laptops than comparable PC builds (the Air shipped with 2GB in the early 2010s, eventually climbing up to 8GB by the time the M1 launched). Further, the latest iteration of the Steam hardware survey shows that 80% of its userbase has at least 16GB of RAM, whereas in 2014 8GB was merely the plurality; not even 40% of users had >= 8GB. A closer comparison point would have been the 4GB mark, which 75% of users met or exceeded. reply michaelt 3 hours agorootparent> That's an unfair comparison. When I visit retailers' websites, the 8GB product category seems to be the one with the most products on offer.

Although I would agree don't charge $1600 and call them \"Pro\" So 8GB machines are still around, and not just in the throwaway $200 laptop segment. I would agree with you that the 2024 Steam hardware survey shows a plurality of users with 16GB, whereas the 2014 survey said 8GB, so progress hasn't entirely stopped.

What you want to do is look at the benchmarks for the thing you're actually using it for. > they're 2-4x more power efficient as well. This is generally untrue, people come to this conclusion by comparing mobile CPUs with desktop CPUs. CPU power consumption is non-linear with performance, so a large power budget lets you eek out a tiny bit more margin. For example, compare the 65W 5700X with the 105W 5800X. The 40 extra watts buys you around 2% more single thread performance, not because the 5700X has a more efficient design -- they're the exact same CPU with a different power cap. It's because turning up the clock speed a tiny bit uses a lot more power, but desktop CPUs do it anyway, because they don't have any such thing as battery life and people want the extra tiny bit more. Or the CPU simply won't clock any higher and doesn't even hit the rated TDP on single-threaded workloads. The extra power will buy you a lot more on multi-threaded workloads, because then you get linear performance improvement with more power by adding more cores. But that's where the high core count CPUs will mop the floor with everything else -- while achieving higher performance per watt, because the individual cores are clocked lower and use less power. reply aurareturn 3 hours agorootparentThe problem with Geekbench is it's trying to average the scores from many different benchmarks, but then if some of them are outliers (e.g. one CPU has hardware acceleration or some other unusual aptitude for that specific workload), it gets an outsized score which is then averaged in and skews the result even if it doesn't generalize.

The blog post you linked just shows that one synthetic benchmark correlates with another synthetic benchmark. Where do SPEC CPU2006/2017 benchmarks guarantee or specify correlation with real-world performance workloads? Cinebench fits characteristics of a good benchmark defined by SPEC [1]. It's not a general benchmark, but biased benchmark. It's floating-point intensive. It should do a perfect job of evaluating Cinema 4D rendering performance, a good job as proxy for other floating-point heavy workloads, but a poor job as proxy for other non-floating-point heavy workloads. The thing is, most real world workloads are biased. So, no single-score benchmark result can do an outstanding job of predicting CPU performance for everyone (which is what a general CPU benchmark with a single final score aims to do). They are useful, but limited in their prediction abilities.

Near 10% IPC uplift and they bumped the e-core on the base M4, so we're probably looking at the same 12 p-cores for the M4 max, but likely going from 4 to 12 e-cores (two of the 6-core complexes). In multithreaded workloads, 2 of their current e-cores are roughly equivalent to 1 p-core, so that would represent the equivalent of 4 extra p-cores. reply resource_waste 4 hours agorootparentprev> How much faster does your Apple Silicon compile compare to a Zen4 (e.g. the 7950x?)?

It's not the entire Geekbench 6 CPU suite. It's deceptive. Overall GB6 improvement is likely around 10-15% only because that's how much IPC improved while clock speed remains the same. reply hajile 3 hours agorootparentprevApple themselves have around 10% IPC uplift with M4 too.

But not only is M4 significantly faster in ST, it'll probably 3-4x more efficient than Zen5 mobile just like how M3 is against Zen4 mobile. This difference in efficiency cannot be explained by node advantage alone as N3E vs N4 is probably around only 15-20% more efficient. reply jiggawatts 10 hours agoprevI wonder when the PC world will transition to unified memory and more monolithic architectures as seen in the Apple M-series chips, but also in the NVIDIA GB200 \"superchip\", the AMD MI300 accelerator, the X-Box and Playstation consoles, and even in some mobile phone system-on-a-chip designs. It feels like the PC is the \"last holdout\" of discrete upgradeable components with relatively low bandwidth between them. Sooner or later, AI will need to run on the edge, and that'll require RAM bandwidths measured in multiple terabytes per second, as well as \"tensor\" compute integrated closely with CPUs. Sure, a lot of people see LLMs as \"useless toys\" or \"overhyped\" now, but people said that about the Internet too. What it took to make everything revolve around the Internet instead of it being just a fad is broadband. When everyone had fast always-on Internet at home and in their mobile devices, then nobody could argue that the Internet wasn't useful. Build it, and the products will come! If every gaming PC had the same spec as a GB200 or MI300, then games could do real-time voice interaction with \"intelligent\" NPCs with low latency. You could talk to characters, and they could talk back. Not just talk, but argue, haggle, and debate! \"No, no, no, the dragon is too powerful! ... I don't care if your sword is a unique artefact, your arm is weak!\" I feel like this is the same kind of step-change as floppy drives to hard drives, or dialup or fibre. It'll take time.

I don't want AI generated stilted dialogue, uncanny valley speech, etc. And I also don't want an extra few hundred watts of power draw on gaming PCs - they're already high and in modern games the CPU is under pretty substantial load, the GPU is maxed out, and the GPU's AI/NPU style cores are being used for things like DLSS too.

    "originBody": "on 31. May 2024 0 Majority for chat control possible – Users who refuse scanning to be prevented from sharing photos and links European Parliament Freedom, democracy and transparency Press releases The highly controversial indiscriminate child sexual abuse regulation (so-called chat control) could still be endorsed by EU governments after all, as France could give up its previous veto. This is reported by Euractiv and confirmed by internal documents. France considers the new “upload moderation” proposal in principle as a viable option. According to the latest draft regulation dated 28 May (Council document 9093/24), which is presented as “upload moderation”, users of apps and services with chat functions are to be asked whether they accept the indiscriminate and error-prone scanning and possibly reporting of their privately shared images, photos and videos. Previously unknown images and videos are also to be scrutinised using “artificial intelligence” technology. If a user refuses the scanning, they would be blocked from sending or receiving images, photos, videos and links (Article 10). End-to-end encrypted services such as Whatsapp or Signal would have to implement the automated searches “prior to transmission” of a message (so-called client-side scanning, Article 10a). The initially proposed scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which is hardly being used to date, is to be scrapped, as is the scanning of voice communication, which has never been done before. Probably as a concession to France, the chats of employees of security authorities and the military are also to be exempted from chat control. During the last discussion on 24 May, the Council Legal Service made it clear that indiscriminate chat control scanning of non-suspects is still envisioned and remains a violation of fundamental rights. Nevertheless, most EU governments are determined to go ahead. EU governments plan to continue their discussions on June 4th. “The Belgian proposal means that the essence of the EU Commission’s extreme and unprecedented initial chat control proposal would be implemented unchanged,” warns MEP and most prominent opponent of chat control Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party). “Using messenger services purely for texting is not an option in the 21st century. And removing excesses that aren’t being used in practice anyway is a sham. Millions of private chats and private photos of innocent citizens are to be searched using unreliable technology and then leaked without the affected chat users being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse – this would destroy our digital privacy of correspondence. Our nude photos and family photos would end up with strangers in whose hands they do not belong and with whom they are not safe. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side scanning would undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in order to turn our smartphones into spies – this would destroy secure encryption. I am alarmed that EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged plans, which threatens to overturn the previous blocking minority. If the EU governments really do go into the trilogue negotiations with this radical position of indiscriminate chat control scanning, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises that put our online security at risk. Now is the time to take to the barricades for privacy and secure encryption.” Information portal and document archive for chat control Tags: Chatcontrol",

Locations and status of missile silos, troop locations, etc. In an ideal world, all of that would be on secured channels that are managed by appropriate entities. In the real world, it seems like a struggle to get troops to stop posting selfies with sensitive data on Facebook; I don’t doubt much more exists in private messages.

I just also think that it's worth considering that there are some communications where the cost of leaking data is higher than the cost of a very low chance of catching CSAM. These exclusions are overly broad in my opinion (the cost of most of these comms leaking is low to non-existent), but there are good reasons for some limited communications to either be excluded or have an alternative system. A Watergate scenario weakens shared belief in the government/democracy. Leaking nuclear secrets is obviously bad. Leaking troop locations/movements is also very bad. A prosecutor getting access to communications between a defendant and their lawyer would be very bad. My preferred solution would be to not have the scanning, for various reasons including that exclusions would either be so broad that practically nothing gets scanned or too narrow and we'd eventually have some kind of crisis. reply r00fus 3 hours agorootparentI predict the scanning will be worked around by all parties except for the ones who really don't need to be scanned. reply InCityDreams 7 hours agorootparentprevAlways NOT surprised why politicians get exempted from these kind of rules.

Some of these laws you can see a trade-off between safety and freedom, which you can decide where to position yourself.

In any platform \"that doesn't allow links\" you see people sharing them anyway through normal text, even if they have to create some new conventions.

For every crafty career criminal there's a dumb idiot doing dumb stuff on account of being a dumb idiot. And even crafty career criminals can and do make mistakes. Of course it won't catch 100% of it, but very few laws or measure do that (and those that do almost always come with very high amounts of false positives). Also links are not hard to scan for either, and you can't \"just\" upload CSAM to anywhere either and not expect troubles sooner or later (unless you know what you're doing, in which case we're back to the previous paragraph). I think it's very hard to deny that of course it will catch a non-zero number of people, although it's hard to determine exactly how many beforehand. That doesn't mean it's a good law, it just means that all these type of \"it won't even catch anyone!\" argument are just bad arguments. reply vasco 8 hours agorootparentI think you're making my argument out to be something else.

I'll go a step further and say that providing such a large platform which ties in to so many aspects of life (whether you want to or not) means accepting some responsibility. This means having at least vaguely helpful support. And also means not being a massive host for CSAM.

This is precisely the kind of situation where a best-effort can be done. Though let us swap your example of \"sex lines\" for something legitimately harmful. Scamming callcenters. Should they stop all scams? No, they can't. Inspecting phone call traffic to monitor for scams would be extremely invasive. Should they disconnect the firm they and everyone else knows are scammers? Yes. Thus the point. When these companies don't make a best-effort, the government gets involved. The only added complexity here is that the chat apps themselves can't do anything. But the big tech giants could stop making the problem infinitely worse, big platform holders who already monitor publicly-posted content could work to ensure their reports are actioned upon. reply robertlagrant 8 hours agorootparent> Should they disconnect the firm they and everyone else knows are scammers?

The European Council can keep proposing pretty much the same law over and over again until they get a pliant EP that will accept it.

Recently in the EU, foreign (also Russian and Chinese) interference has been more visible in parties on the political right.

The extreme left is the least likely to be significantly corrupted by Russian interests, since the goals of far left parties in Europe typically align very badly with Russia's goals. The only exception is that far left parties are typically anti-war, so they view support of Ukraine's military quite suspiciously. But on all other fronts, a modern far-left Europe would be a disaster for Russia. The single most important Russian interest in the region is to sell its fossil fuels, which the far left is very skeptical of. reply snowpid 7 hours agorootparent\" the Center (especially in Germany, with examples like Gerhard Schroder becoming a VP of Gazprom almost immediately after his last stint as chancellor). \" Schröder was part of the Center - Left and the Left in the SPD were very proud of their \"understanding of Russia\" . \" The extreme left is the least likely to be significantly corrupted by Russian interests, since the goals of far left parties in Europe typically align very badly with Russia's goals. \" This is contraire against any evidence, which ignoring examples from above. reply staunton 8 hours agorootparentprev> It also clearly visible on the Left (in Germany Wagenknecht, die Linke, in France le francais insoumni, every Communist and Left populist party I am aware of) Those parties certainly seem more sympathetic to Russia than \"centre\" parties in their rethoric and likely policy.

But when we learned to produce it on an industrial scale, suddenly our love for sweet things became a liability. The same is now true of data. In an age of information overabundance, our curiosity, which once focused us, now distracts us. And it’s led to an epidemic of intellectual obesity that’s clogging our minds with malignant junk. The analogy of information as sugar is not just rhetoric. A 2019 study by researchers at Berkeley found that information acts on the brain’s dopamine-producing reward system in the same way as food. Put simply, the brain treats information as a reward in itself; it doesn't matter whether the info is accurate or useful, the brain will still crave it and feel satisfied after consuming it (at least until it starts craving more). For hundreds of millennia, this wasn't a problem, because on the plains of the savanna, information was as scarce and precious as sugar. But this all changed with the rise of industrial society and the web. We now live in an attention economy, where people are trying to draw our interest by any means possible. Since low-quality information is just as effective at satisfying our information-cravings as high-quality information, the most efficient way to get attention in the digital age is by mass-producing low-quality “junk info”— a kind of fast food for thought. Like fast food, junk info is cheap to produce and satisfying to consume, but high in additives and low in nutrition. It's also potentially addictive and, if consumed excessively, highly dangerous. Junk info is often false info, but it isn't junk because it's false. It's junk because it has no practical use; it doesn't make your life better, and it doesn't improve your understanding. Even lies can be nourishing; the works of Dostoevsky are fiction, yet can teach you more about humans than any psychology textbook. Meanwhile, most verified facts do nothing to improve your life or understanding, and are, to paraphrase Nietzsche, as useful as knowledge of the chemical composition of water to someone who is drowning. Common types of junk info include gossip, trivia, clickbait, hackery, marketing, churnalism, and babble. But in fact, any information that you can't use is junk info. A typical example on social media would be a photo of a freshly cooked burger, captioned with “Look what I just made!” but posted without a recipe so you can't even recreate it. Such an image might make you briefly salivate, and possibly spur you to make a burger of your own, but it provides no discernible value to your life. Most people don't think very hard about what they post on social media, and such people are naturally able to post at a faster rate than more careful minds, so trivialities (e.g. “feeling tired, might go to sleep, lol”) quickly saturate these platforms. But the junk info that spreads furthest of all is that which evokes strong emotions, and this hasn't gone unnoticed by those, such as journalists and commentators, who are most desperate for your attention. The easiest strong emotion to evoke is outrage; it requires nothing more sophisticated than a simple story of oppression, tailored to the appropriate political tribe. And yet outrage, for all its cheapness, is highly addictive and highly contagious, making it the weapon of choice for anyone who wants to be noticed in the online cacophony. Even once-respected outlets like the New York Times now resort to “ragebait,” sensationalist stories calculated to infuriate both the newspaper's readers and its political opponents, ensuring maximum attention. Market forces and social pressures have caused junk info to dominate the web because it's cheap, easy to produce, and good at stealing your attention. Its ubiquity means it's always within easy reach of netizens, and as a result, millions of people are now hooked on it. It's why they endlessly scroll their Twitter timelines or check their Instagram notifications, or repeatedly click refresh on the YouTube homepages, or keep renewing their subscriptions to the Times. The vast majority of the online content you consume today won't improve your understanding of the world. In fact, it may just do the opposite; recent research suggests that people browsing social media tend to experience “normative dissociation” in which they become less aware and less able to process information, to such an extent that they often can’t recall what they just read. But despite being “empty calories,” junk info still tastes delicious. Since your dopamine pathways can't distinguish between useful and useless info, consuming junk info gives you the satisfaction of feeling like you're learning—it offers you the sensation of mental nourishment—even though all you're really doing is shoving virtual popcorn into your skull. Eventually, the addiction to useless info leads to what I call “intellectual obesity.” Just as gorging on junk food bloats your body, so gorging on junk info bloats your mind, filling it with a cacophony of half-remembered gibberish that sidetracks your attention and confuses your senses. Unable to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant, you become concerned by trivialities and outraged by falsehoods. These concerns and outrages push you to consume even more, and all the time that you're consuming, you're prevented from doing anything else: learning, focusing, even thinking. The result is that your stream of consciousness becomes clogged; you develop atherosclerosis of the mind. We now live in a state of constant distraction caused by an addiction to useless information, and this distraction is so overpowering it even distracts us from the fact we're being distracted. You'll probably read this article, briefly consider the damage junk info has done to you, and then return to aimlessly scrolling Twitter. But before you do that, let's try to work out some kind of solution. The most straightforward way to improve your information diet is to develop a habit for meta-awareness; to pay attention to what you're paying attention to. When you find yourself reaching unprompted for your phone, or hovering over the Twitter icon, invoke the “10-10-10 rule:” ask yourself, if I consume this info, how will I feel about it in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years? Doing this may help you realize that the brief sugar-rush offered by junk info is so transient and insignificant in the grand scheme of your life that it's simply not worth your time. And if your cravings can't be beaten by mere reasoning, then consider rearranging your lifestyle so junk info is simply not an option. The way I beat intellectual obesity was by trying to become the best writer I can be. Writing requires you to filter out bad information because you have a duty to your readers to not be full of shit. Writing also forces you to periodically shut out information altogether so you can be alone with your thoughts. This regular confrontation with yourself helps you keep your bearings in a world constantly trying to lure you away from your brain. Ultimately you'll have to determine the info-diet that works for you. But if you insist on endlessly consuming whatever the web serves you, know that this banquet culminates in a bitter dessert: at the end of your life, when you're weighing your regrets, you probably won’t say “Man, I wish I’d spent more time browsing the web.” On the contrary, you'll have no recollection of that tweet by a stranger telling you they prefer pasta to pizza, or that gif that amused you for five seconds, or that Times piece that made you mad for a whole minute. And when you notice the myriad holes that all this junk has left in your memory, then it’ll finally be clear that you weren’t consuming it as much as it was consuming you.

I'd argue that the difference comes from the brain trying to classify what information is useful and then rewarding you for engaging with that useful information. So for example, at least for me TikTok isn't useful and thus doesn't engage me at all, its just irritating to try to get into it. But for many other people their brains obviously identifies TikTok differently than mine, likely seeing it as useful so rewards them for it. So the problem is information that most people misclassify as useful even when it isn't. It is like sweeteners, they don't give you calories but your taste buds still rewards you as if you did get a lot of calories. I'd say that isn't an obesity crisis though, people sit and eat those artificial sweetener information all day and thus starve out on real useful information since they don't get any of it. reply ffwd 15 hours agoparentI agree and I think if there are any hazards to modern information landscape it's kind of 2 fold (that I can think of) 1) the brain likes simple generalized information/models more than specific information and 2) the brain likes information that confirms our existing beliefs more than staying in a gray area where it's not sure what information is true or not. Regarding first one I think one of the main challenges will be finding which general explanations are true or not. This can be anything from cultural things like gender discussions to conspiracy theories to scientific theories. If there are generalized models that explain a lot of phenomena, the brain likes those, but at the same time they can also take the place for when empirical evidence should have been gathered (that doesn't fit with the general model), and so in that sense they can be hazardous. And models that already have stood up to a lot of empirical data are especially hazardous because they have already proven themselves to some extent which means there's even less incentive to gather empirical data. Or at least that's my current (maybe hazardous) general view. I also don't think we should give up on generalized models because they are so powerful and useful, but it's definitely a challenge in todays climate because they get so many clicks and they are very satisfying to know. reply Lisdexamfeta 13 hours agoparentprevI think the essay is really speaking to a particular type of person, one whom is described in Tyler Cowen's book The Age of the Infovore: Succeeding in the Information Economy. This sort of person is probably reasonably common on HN (and that help explain the upvotes for the essay) but not super common in the broader and larger population. The real kind of underlying question is about how to be most effective. reply stevenAthompson 6 hours agorootparentI believe that's generally referred to as the \"assumed similarity bias\", and does appear to be what's going on here. I recently read someplace that only 54% of Americans read at least one full book last year, and that includes audiobooks. It doesn't seem to me like a world full of infovores. reply schmidtleonard 15 hours agoparentprev> TikTok isn't useful If information is increasingly hyper-abundant and attention is not, we must increasingly learn to value high bandwidth / compressed communication. Like TikTok. Yeah, most of the content is unproductive attention bait, but that's true of any medium. Yeah, some information compresses poorly and really does require irreducible minutes or pages. However, I've seen a 10 second TikTok monkey-see-monkey-do beat a 10 page instruction manual full of diagrams and paragraphs at effectively instructing newbies who always struggled with cable assemblies -- until they didn't, because they had TikTok. reply skydhash 14 hours agorootparent> If information is increasingly hyper-abundant and attention is not, we must increasingly learn to value high bandwidth / compressed communication. Like TikTok. What has grown is irrelevant information. We don't need compressed communication (which loose nuance and is dangerous, because it leads to erroneous understanding) or high bandwidth one (which doesn't lead to reflection and internalization). What we need is better filtering. Be conscious and mindful of what you're spending your time on. Instead of watching 500 hundreds video of making cakes, just buy a cookbook and go make cakes. > However, I've seen a 10 second TikTok monkey-see-monkey-do beat a 10 page instruction manual full of diagrams and paragraphs at effectively instructing newbies who always struggled with cable assemblies -- until they didn't, because they had TikTok. Short Training Videos existed before tiktok (I had a VHS tape for learning Windows and it was mostly a collection of these). But that's mostly like watching someone play a song on the piano and believing you can do it too. If you have a good memory, you can probably replay the same song, but you still can't play the piano. Some fields don't have that depth of theory. But books are still the best at transmitting it (watching an expert is best at understanding it). reply schmidtleonard 3 hours agorootparentIt's funny that you're repeating my statements on other forms of media sometimes being more appropriate back to me as if I hadn't thought of the possibility, lol. Better filtering values compression. There are other concerns -- I mentioned them myself -- but compression is orthogonal and significant and TikTok progresses considerably on that front and if you don't see the value in it you're missing out in a big way. reply unhingedcrouton 1 hour agorootparentprev> What we need is better filtering. Better filtering, while useful, is a fools errand. What we really need is to remove the incentives to produce junk content. I have no idea how but I am pretty sure it is related to digital ~~cancer~~ advertising. reply YurgenJurgensen 14 hours agorootparentprevNothing is stopping you from putting a 10-second webm in that instruction manual, and has the advantage that you're not selling your soul to a company that probably hates you. reply johnisgood 15 hours agoparentprevYeah, if anything, watching TikTok would make me feel guilty for having wasted my time. It does not work for me for entertainment either. reply DaSHacka 14 hours agorootparentI feel the same, especially since I've actively avoided TikTok after first trying it out shortly after the Musical.ly rebrand. What makes it worse is literally _every_ other social media network baking the a TikTok clone into their existing apps; Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, the list goes on and on. So even though I've avoided TikTok, I can't stop this garbage dopamine-slop content from being shoved in my face. Especially egregious is SnapChat, which immediately moves you to their version of TikTok and autoplays videos after you finish checking your friends stories, with no warning. I always feel like utter garbage after falling down these rabbitholes; That's time I can never get back, and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. Thankfully more and more people are seeing the issues caused by these social networks, so going full cold-turkey and uninstalling the worst offenders isn't unheard of and isn't as much of a blow to one's social circle as it once was. reply Scene_Cast2 15 hours agoprevSlightly tangential - there's this quote I've been thinking of: \"The ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life.\" On one hand, chess is pretty well regarded. On the other, it's pretty memorization heavy - not just openings, but end game strategies and patterns in general. It takes up brain space. I've been trying to frame it in terms of enjoyment.

You can feel wonderful watching the video on time dilation but there is a zero chance a single viewer of that video actually understands any of the presented equations (or understands the various counter arguments/theories and nuances). You will leave with a shallow understanding of the topic. If you talk to an expert, they will have to work hard to not embarrass you. reply Aerroon 12 hours agorootparentBut I think that's where learning begins. The most-likely point of failure in learning is motivation. Getting somebody interested with bite-sized information can bait a person to go further without them using up much motivation. You're not going to learn every topic you hear about, but you might learn some. reply pompino 12 hours agorootparentThat sounds nice, but I don't agree that it is the most-likely point. Anyway, I would argue the point of failure is lack of expert level guidance/mentorship and (sometimes) monetary resources to pursue higher education. Once you've received formal training, you also need someone to bounce ideas off-off, or a community for collaboration etc, etc. reply Aerroon 10 hours agorootparentI think you're right in a sense. Expert-level guidance is helpful, but I think its main value is filling up the gaps of motivation. Take school as an example. You don't need a math teacher to learn math. Everything you learn in that class is in the textbook. The textbook will even teach you math in a more formal way than a teacher will (at least mine did). But very few people end up learning math from the textbook. It's not because the teacher has better expert knowledge than the book, but because the teacher keeps you engaged in the learning process. A book won't do that. I think a sufficient amount of motivation can overcome a lack of expert guidance and lack of formal training. It might not get you to the exact same result as somebody that did receive all that, but for a lot of things I think it can get you close. I do agree with you on monetary resources. That will kill motivation and limit your ability to get guidance. reply zero-sharp 2 hours agorootparentprevI mean, I understand that you can't usually get a deep understanding of a topic through a youtube video. Sometimes when I watch math videos I'm surprised by the density of the information. Things that I studied in college that took practice, exploration, and grappling will get a 30 second explanation. On the other hand, you'll also find lectures from professors and other content made by professionals. I bookmark them and probably never look at them ever again. It's valuable, interesting, but it's too much. reply makeitdouble 14 hours agoparentprevIt sounds like you found a happy place where your mind can get infinitely engaged and you can get back to it whenever needed ? Arguably that's better than being apathic and frustrated all day long with no escape. In particular you seem to handle it responsibly, it all sounds pretty nice as you put it. reply layer8 11 hours agorootparentOne can be infinitely engaged and apathic and frustrated at the same time. reply LoganDark 16 hours agoparentprevAbsolutely. The only place I get videos from is from my home page. I use an extension (Unhook) to remove the side recommendations and end cards, otherwise I'd never be able to finish.

Obesity is bad, of course because it makes your life more difficult, but also due to the negative feedback loop. It’s hard to start exercising if you are already in bad health. I don’t see a similar feedback look with information.

I don’t think they scratch the itch for anybody. They aren’t dangerous, IMO. Politics and tech stuff seem more dangerous to me. They are legitimately important and useful. But, for politics, you can only read so many stories before your mind is made up. There’s important stuff going on, but reading a dozen stories about one thing and then listening to the podcast just amps up the anxiety. Tech stuff, I could waste ages reading about stacks and algorithms I’ll never use… reply warcher 14 hours agoparentIn the end if reading content, especially content that is emotionally evocative, does not initiate some sort of change in action or thinking, it is useless. The overwhelming majority of political content is useless. Did you do anything? Did anything actually happen?

The primary reason to engage with social media is not to consume useless content. If that's all it was, I wouldn't use it. No, the primary reasons are: to improve your professional standing, attract an audience that can be monetized, and learn useful information in your field (which can also be monetized). Or to make it even simpler: money, and power. That changes the perspective on what has value and what is worth saying & doing. For example, \"low effort content\" obviously has value if that's your goal, since you can spend 10 minutes crafting some tweet about your profession with low reach, or 10s photographing your food for a similar result. If you can type out something low effort than you can squeeze it in during work hours, for example - and building an audience is one example of how that could pay off. Second, if money and power are your goal, then getting very familiar with marketing content is useful also. You have to learn what engages people and what gets people to sign up for stuff, even if its tedious or slightly cheesy. And hanging out on social media is how you do that. Finally, if there are useful professional jewels amid all the chaff, then it may be okay that 95% of it is junk, if 5% of it is good. I will say that there are times when I've sworn off social media, then dipped back and noticed, actually, I do learn useful stuff here.

I often open Hacker News, scan the titles, and open all interesting threads in separate tabs for later reading (I opened this thread the same way). Each thread usually contains insightful discussions and useful references on topics I enjoy, like music, programming, and recently, LLMs. Unlike Reddit, I often read the original articles instead of just shit-posting on clickbait titles. Most of the discussions and articles are information-dense, requiring a significant amount of time and mental effort to read through them all (and close all the tabs). It's not uncommon for these dozens of open tabs to drain my willpower just by being there all day long. I feel like I'm driven by FOMO rather than sheer curiosity.

Computerized too when lots of the chemical plants still didn't have that either. For a while there I had the only advanced abilities in this type analysis. This is the modern apparatus in use today that was seen only rarely for research purposes when I set it up the first time for routine use. The technology was very well set to emerge on its own. Nothing that wouldn't have been done without me eventually, and by about 10 years later most operations had progressed in that direction, in many analytical fields besides chemicals, without any relationship to my particular early effort. But I've probably still run more experiments in this field than anybody else who didn't start that early. With the employee turnover of a measurement bureau having an inherently outdated approach to staff, alternative international testing labs were eager to pick up our people who knew how to do this. Bigger companies knew I was up to something the whole time but I was not trying to hide anything, just not giving away the details. When it comes to alcohols, at the beginning all the PhD's who were established chided me that it couldn't be done the way I had in mind. Little did they know I had already validated it for a year, so they didn't actually turn out to be wrong in the end. They were all wrong from the beginning and I knew it as I went along. And that's just the apparatus, which is all over the world now, plus for alcohols well-standardized internationally. Even though the standard allows for lower performance and uses lesser math than I had implemented originally. Now that I have officially retired from my last employer, I still consult and earlier this week the manager called me about a specialty chemical on the way that nobody knows how to do and there are no publications. We'll see if this ship comes in. It's really just a non-toxic hiatus for me, I grew up in a retirement community, so unspoiled resort life has already been accomplished and well behind me for decades. Still deciding whether it's best to present the advanced math at a conference this year or next. That I will be able to take full credit for if I want to, and it could be quite popular now that people have the corresponding apparatus already. Regardless, the way we do it is slides and lecture only, no publication will necessarily be forthcoming. That reminds me, I don't disclose much but last time it was 2021, maybe a week after Windows 11 was released. Here's how I did it, being the only one seen with W11 (even up to this year w10 outnumbers it 10:1). Two laptops, neither one fully meeting the stiffest software requirements, one with HDMI, the other much further out-of-date with VGA. Each alternatively multibootable to XP on demand (just in case) with the same Powerpoint, projectable from either OS on either laptop. All slides at the native resolution of the projector supplied by the AV service. HDMI it was, no need for XP arose but it turned out the HDMI cable that was supplied by AV was a worn out POS which would have been a show-stopper except I pulled out a long HDMI cord brand new in the package, manager hooked it up and we kept on going. reply zer00eyz 10 hours agorootparent... chided me that it couldn't be done the way I had in mind.

As long as you're going to spend 8 hours per day relaxing, why not learn something new along the way? If you're going to have fun while learning -- if it's not something you have to force yourself to do -- that's even better right? Sure, this learning will come in the form of lots of little bits and pieces. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Imagine going super deep into a single subject, then eventually realizing that subject isn't even useful. Plus, I've found that if I try to do intensive single-subject learning, it begins to feel like work anyways. Learning little bits and pieces seems less taxing for my brain, and is arguably better from a spaced-repetition point of view too. The piece seems to mainly rest on a single study which is here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501899 Based on a quick skim, that study didn't actually measure retention of info from social media. Even if it did, the right way to measure retention would not be to ask \"Do you remember what you read this past week?\" That's not a useful way for your brain to index information. It'd be better to ask someone about the topic of something they read, and see if they had any recollections related to it. I think many people do use social media in an unhealthy way.

Far from being \"junk information\", I believe it to be a wonderful opportunity. Rather than avoid it, we should do the exact opposite by seeing the extraordinary opportunity in adverstity. What opportunity? The opportunity to mindfully explore why it triggers the emotion of rage in us. Why is this useful? Because rage is an accurate predictor of a learning disability that is holding us back from reaching our full potential. Both as individuals and as a species. Learning disability? What do you mean? The Buddha pointed out that avijjā, the choice to ignore uncomfortable truths, is the root cause of all suffering. The Buddha called such rage bait, the first arrow. The first arrow is, in reality, a notification of sensory motor misprediction. We experience this notification of misprediction as pain because this alerts the brain to the existence of an error in our sensory motor predictive model. In order to restore equanimity as we move through this domain of sensory experience, the brain should respond by striving to correct the error in the model so that sensory experience is predicted correctly. With the error corrected, we can now move through that domain of sensory experience without anxiety; confident that our model will guide us to make good decisions. Most of the time, we do this. However, sometimes, a bias we have prevents us from doing so. The Buddha called such biases, āsava. The path to liberating the mind involves the total destruction of the āsava. The suffering we experience in response to rage bait then is an inner conflict between 2 strategies to satiate our craving for the restoration of the certainty of an accurate predictive model of sensory experience. 1: The more intelligent strategy of seeking to find and correct the error in the predictive model so that we can \"see the world the way it actually is\" and 2: The less intelligent strategy of clinging to bias and demanding that sensory experience bend to our will now. i.e. between 1: mature delayed gratification and 2: immature immediate gratification ALL suffering we have ever experienced, are experiencing and will ever experience is an inner conflict between these 2 parts of us pulling in different directions. ALL suffering we have ever experienced, are experiencing and will ever experience is resolved by extinguishing the craving for things to be different than they actually are now in favor of seeing the world the way it actually is. We don't see it as such when we are doing it, but suffering is clearly a learning disability. Were we to free our mind of all such learning disabilities, rage bait would have no effect on us whatsoever. In this regard, rage bait everywhere should be seen as a wonderful opportunity to free our minds of a learning disability that is preventing us from contributing to our full potential. Both as individuals and as a species. What might billions of minds liberated from bias in this fashion be capable of producing? For this reason, \"rage-bait\" should be embraced as a wonderful opportunity. reply lo_zamoyski 4 hours agoprevThe general idea, that we suffer from a kind of information glut, is true. And by glut, I don't even mean the ubiquity of bad information. I mean specifically and especially the bad habit of consuming it inordinately. The desire to know is an appetite, like the desire for food, sex, etc. And like any appetite, it must be moderated, ordered, and tempered by restraint and reason, which is to say the good. Otherwise, it becomes a vice, a bad and destructive thing. It doesn't lead to wisdom and understanding. It doesn't contribute to your station in life or your life's ultimate end. It can become the basis for arrogance, and pride may be the motive.

Maybe this is obvious to you but it's not necessarily obvious to everyone. - The author points out that this would have historically been an evolutionary advantage (at least that's my interpretation), but access to modern high-volume, low-nutrient information has made this an addictive unhealthy habit. - For those already familiar with how modern access to high-calorie, low-nutrient food (that triggers the dopamine response), the author is showing that the same mechanisms are at play with information.

I guess the difference now is that the web is much more interactive, and our minds can be more easily hooked as a result. Dunno; when I was growing up, the kids who gorged themselves on shitty cable TV weren't the brightest bulbs in the chandelier. I feel the same now in the Internet era.

Most of time, I think, \"No, it isn't that different.\" (I use the same mental exercise when I hear people say that \"this generation is so different than the last for reason A, B, or C.\") reply usrbinbash 13 hours agorootparent> but what about crap daily newspapers that came in mass around 1900, then radio, then over-air television, then cable television? a) None of these were, first algorithmically, and then using machine learning, optimized to constantly grab attention and maximize interaction time on an individual basis. b) None of them had the interactive effects where peoples interactions with one another are guided and used, to draw them into echo chambers which are, again, designed to maximize interaction time. > Then think: Is this really that different? Yes. It is. Simple example: How do politically motivated troll armies influence an election in a reality where people don't use social media as their primary news source? Answer: They don't.

If you trace them back to the sources you arrive at academic papers that are just intellectually fraudulent in various ways, like they misrepresent their data or they are identifying real westerners as Russian bots.

Also, a lot of stories on Russia are or were plain old western misinformation, long predating Ukraine: https://blog.plan99.net/правда-6e24757a67ba So it's very important to be careful when making claims about \"influencing elections\" because there's such a long history of false claims from western sources, amplified by western media, of which the outlets you've cited are prime offenders unfortunately. reply benterix 5 hours agorootparentAs this subject is interesting to me, I decided to read one of your articles to understand where you are coming from. And I came across this part[0]: > The cited evidence is two men who joined the Lithuanian Rifleman’s Union, an organisation with a stable membership of around 10,000 people (0.3% of the population). ... The article presents no data or other evidence to suggest behavioural changes in the Lithuanian population: the anecdote of two people is generalised to the entire country. So I checked the article and it says: > \"We are growing dramatically in numbers. Three years ago we had 50 people in Vilnius - now we have 3,000.\" and then: > Some 4,000 troops are being shipped out to the region - with 1,000 German soldiers allocated to Lithuania. So while I believe your engagement in bot detection is genuine and you can offer some useful insights into how some bot detection platform are broken, as for the field reporting, forgive me but I still trust more traditional journalists than you, in spite of living on this Earth long enough to realize everything is imperfect.

Still, it looks like you're right about the recruiting. This was written seven years ago, guess I didn't spot the quote about their growth. I'll remove that story and add a note to the bottom. There will still be 15 examples which is plenty to make the point, especially as that's the least important example. > I still trust more traditional journalists than you By all means, trust who you want! But bear in mind you could easily check these examples because there are links and sources for everything, something journalists often don't provide. For example, the Reuters story in the parent post about \"Peace Data\" doesn't seem to have any links at all. reply montjoy 8 hours agorootparentprevI want to believe you but now I have to trust your claims over what the NYT, etc are publishing. In order to do that I not only need to follow your sources but the original sources that NYT etc define to ensure they are the same.

To put an even finer point in it, they're asking us to believe their blog posts over numerous large media outlets, and even above (presumably) peer reviewed research.

Some of these statements are completely untrue, many contains bits of real information mixed with false statements. I don't know who is behind these and I will never have a proof, but ignoring this massive phenomena will get us nowhere. Specifically, what gets me worried is not the subset that is related to making Westerners averse to supporting Ukraine but many subtle and not so subtle attempts at sowing discord using the divisions already present in our society. This really works extremely well and we're super-weak when faced with these. reply mike_hearn 5 hours agorootparentDo you have any specific examples of claims that worry you? reply skhunted 3 hours agorootparentThe Russian claim that Ukrainians are Nazis. This claim is based off of members of right wing paramilitary organizations that fight Russian occupation. Of course if such a broad generalization could be made based on a few people then would also claim that Russia are themselves Nazis based off of Prigoshin’s SS tattoos. One can find numerous examples of right leaning Americans repeating the claim that Ukrainians are Nazis. These same people are intellectually immune to applying the same reasoning when confronted by similar evidence of Russian Nazism. reply mistermann 5 hours agorootparentprevDoes it bother you if it is domestic media and politicians sowing discord? How do you figure all of this stuff out anyways, do you have a massive spreadsheet or model of some kind? But then, those can inventory stories, but they typically don't help much with whether the stories are true, assuming that matters. reply skhunted 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s obvious that there are misinformation campaigns coming from Russia and China directed at Americans and others.

It's not that different to me. reply thecodedmessage 7 hours agorootparentScrolling shitty cable is much less fun and therefore less addictive. It’s also not always available. But both are terrible ways to spend your time and bad for your brain. reply kmarc 12 hours agorootparentprevI do see some. TV shows are longer. And I don't mean double the length, but literally 100xtimes longer. There is a chance you accidentally find a channel with a program that really triggers your curiosity, and then you stop scrolling. On TikTok, this is not possible, after a couple seconds the mildly interesting content is gone. Good luck finding it again, or even remembering what you found interesting in the morning sitting on the toilet swearing \"you'll check out this topic later\" Another aspect is the quality of the content, which, chances are, higher. Not all of the programmes, obviously, but, again, you might find a documentary, an art piece (aka movie), etc. On TikTok/instagram/yt/Facebook reels anyone can post any rubbish, without any curation, and it's up to some algorithm to decide if it's shown to you. Not to mention the regimen you create, the ritual if you like, of sitting down in front of the TV at the time your beloved programme is aired. I used to think a lot about the \"it's the same as TV / newspaper / books used to be\" argument, and I definitely believe it's not. Especially since I dated the \"book reader\" and the \"insta story addict\" persons and tried to have conversations with them about topics. Day and night. In fact, I started going back to TV. Not the smartphone-controlled / streaming kind, but using the remote. And scrolling through the handful of channels I added to favorites. I do sometimes stop at a random program (yesterday I just learned that there are venomous beetles in Switzerland!). Sometimes I won't and switch the TV off, and just stare out on the windows. TV doomscrolling is bad (news channels to the front). A bit less worse than \"social media\" (scrolling addiction). I kinda think the suggested meta observation (10-10-10) is worth to try. reply adamrezich 12 hours agorootparentprevWith cable TV, you might click around while finding something to watch, but when you found something to watch, you'd watch it, for multiple minutes, until commercial break. Then, you'd either sit through the commercials, or press JUMP to go back to your \"backup channel\", with something else you'd want to watch while you estimated the duration of the commercial block on the first channel. The point is, you were being exposed to novel content at a much slower rate than you are when you scroll through your short-video social media feeds. It already wasn't a great situation to begin with, as far as attention spans are concerned, but this new age of short video social media apps has undoubtedly exacerbated the issue. reply mistermann 11 hours agorootparentprevIf you curate your feed, TikTok offers plenty of useful content, way beyond what you could find on 2000's cable tv, or anywhere else even today.

I don’t see how that would be possible without reading the news I see this meme repeated all the time, but I have my doubts. First of all, approximately no one does it anyway - one would have to take effort finding out sources from opposite ends of political spectrum (vs. \"opposite\" but really just the same), and then force themselves to read all of them (vs. just the most enjoyable one or two). It's possible as a form of study It's definitely not what's happening when you see people reading the news with their coffee or on the bus. Secondly, opinions aren't like waves that cancel out. You read a thing in source A and then the opposite of it in source B, it's not like you're left with enlightened lack of opinion. You just expended twice the energy to read twice the amount of lies. Lies which will stay with you and pop into your consciousness when thinking or talking about the topic they pertain to.

There will be content written by a variety of people, so you'll automatically be exposed to different opinions, It doesn't need to be the full spectrum, even. > You just expended twice the energy to read twice the amount of lies Are you claiming that all news sources publish lies exclusively here…? Other than that, opinions don't need to cancel each other out. You just need to be aware of a different view on things to even consider that some other viewpoint might resonate with you more. If you only ever heard, say, abortion opponents, their arguments may seem reasonable and sound to you, so much that you don't question their claim to be right; but the moment you get exposed to critical voices, you're in the position to even decide which side's arguments convince you. If, instead, you opt to just blindfold yourself, you stop participating in democratic processes—which is a civic duty—and let other people decide for you.

And as the virus author, you've never seen Linux, have no idea about anything past the C64, including bioses, CPU structure, APIs, PCI/etc architecture, and all other computing hardware, and? That's being friendly, because they'd be interfacing with computing systems hundreds, thousands, or millions of years more advanced, written by aliens, which view the universe entirely differently due to different brain structures, with an unknown number or type of senses, with an unknown way those senses work or are perceived, with \"code\" not necessarily in binary, or using silicon based chips, or even transistors, or.. well, this part never ends.

That has the additional benefit of also inverting the x axis. reply netmare 12 hours agorootparentYou could then fix the inverted x axis by using the mouse on the underside of the table.

I say technically because neither by building or downloading with wget I can get a local html version working, so I guess it would be useful to waste time creating 5 QR codes. reply alexjplant 15 hours agoparentNintendo kind of did this back in the day with the e-Reader accessory for the Game Boy Advance. It used dot-based \"barcodes\" to encode NES games onto cards that you scanned and subsequently played from RAM.

In that case, one could build a QR code html interpreter (aka read > output to file > open the file with firefox ) and it would be so cool reply mr_mitm 9 hours agorootparentI did that trickery and it works: https://github.com/AdrianVollmer/Zundler (I had to fix the mime type detection and I'll have to push that fix to PyPI, so use the main branch if you want to try it yourself.) Unfortunately, since we have to ship it with the gzip lib pako.js, the size more than quadruples to 77kb, so no QR code with this approach. Maybe I should look into making compression optional. reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agorootparentYou can use DecompressionStream instead of pako.js for all modern browsers. FetchCrunch [1] uses it to generate self-extracting HTML files, which were not portable at that time but now fully portable across browsers.

Also fun fact the \"crosshair\" in original Quake was limited to only the character \"+\" from the character set. QuakeWorld later introduced a \"crosshair 2\" which was a slightly more complicated bitmap that you could change the color of. reply huesatbri 14 hours agorootparentAnd the “+” was slightly off center as well if I remember correctly. reply lloeki 13 hours agorootparentMy memory is fuzzy, there might not even had one at all in the first version. I had one of the first publicly distributed one (on a promo CD) and I remember it sure lacked a lot of stuff that were present down the road, IIRC even early 3dfx and then glquake had a bit more console options. As for alignment, well at 320x200 (or 240 if your video card+monitor could manage): - the crosshair might have been on the HUD layer which was pixel-aligned. - 2px wide would have been quite wide, and 1px would have been off centre. Tradeoffs tradeoffs. I remember thinking that Doom had this \"always looking down the sights\" feel and Quake inherited that but the 3D aspect of it was more like the weapon felt belly height instead of shoulder height. Since weapon was centered it wasn't too hard to aim horizontally, but Quake having 3d look up down and LOS hitscan line (vs Doom which hit the first enemy along a vertical plane) made Q hard-ish to aim vertically. reply eru 12 hours agorootparent> - 2px wide would have been quite wide, and 1px would have been off centre. Off-centre of your monitor, but not necessarily off-centre as far as the game is concerned: it would be trivial to shift everything one (or half?) a pixel to the upper left. Ie so that your shooting direction perfectly aligns with the crosshair. You could do that for any crosshair position. Even cross-hairs that are off-screen. reply lloeki 11 hours agorootparentTo be fair, I don't think it really mattered, I mean there was so much hackery going on (either because of oversight or as performance tricks)† than a pixel off isn't really a problem. † such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gNYTqn3qRc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfY96tAqmdI reply tomduncalf 12 hours agorootparentprevI seem to recall you had to open the console and type “crosshair 1”.

He had a little crosshair made of string taped to the middle of his monitor. reply system2 11 hours agoprevIt is mind boggling for 13kb. After a few minutes I didn't even feel the difference. Just perfect. reply mdaniel 14 hours agoprevI promise this is not intended as snark: if you already have .php files used for the build, why then do string and memory management in C? reply phoboslab 9 hours agoparentI assume you're talking about the pack_map.c used during build? That just was written in C because I had the .map parser already lying around from another side project. If I had done it from scratch for this project it likely would have been JS or PHP, too. reply bilekas 11 hours agoparentprevI don't know for sure, but I would hazard a guess that it would take up less space, if memory serves, I don't think PHP has pointers for example and I guess things like that would be more space efficient in c. reply treve 15 hours agoprev [–] Mind bending! reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I spent a few months in a bandwidth constrained environment (bluetooth tunnel to free Cafe wifi across the town square...). I generally got a few KB/s. The recent article on Antarctica's internet reminded me of those days. HN was one of the only sites that was reasonably pleasant to use during that time. Still, I found it more fun and faster to surf via a VPS. So the VPS itself would load and render the page, and only send me the bytes over Mosh (a more efficient SSH protocol). I tried a few terminal based browsers using this setup. The one that worked best for HN (especially comment indentation!) was w3m. Here's the current thread in w3m: https://files.catbox.moe/zuabb4.png I did have fast mobile data but it was expensive and limited. I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and one day realized that almost everything I watched was actually just lectures or discussions. So I could just stream the audio and save 80% of the bandwidth. I set up a little PHP script* that took a YouTube URL and ran `youtube-dl -g f bestaudio` to give you the URL of an audio-only stream. (Directly from YouTube's servers!) I could then just load it directly in my browser, or download it for later. (I think I should have used `worstaudio` instead.) * That little utility page is not up anymore, but others found it very useful so I should probably make another one... Another benefit of this is to battery life (decoding video is expensive) and being able to turn off the screen (a feature that Google banned from the app store, years before making their own (paid) version available...) Later I learned about f-droid and newpipe... good times :) reply fragmede 18 hours agoparentThe Antarctica Internet one reminded me of http://hn.zip, which caches as much as it can for spotty connections. reply lukeschaefer 1 hour agorootparentAuthor of hn.zip here - thanks so much for the shout out! I never really publicize it and never 100% finished it, but I'm so glad people are using it! It's basically how I browse HN on my phone and once it reached 90% good enough I stopped working on it haha. reply inslee1 4 hours agorootparentprevGreat link! Might have found a bug in Chrome with it though :) I was curious to see more about the internals so I opened up Chrome Devtools and as soon as I clicked on the \"Application\" tab, it crashes Chrome and did it every time. reply codetrotter 17 hours agorootparentprevThe https://www.hn.zip/ website links to a GitHub repo https://github.com/lukeschaefer/hn.zip but that repo link currently gives a 404. Maybe owner of the site forgot to make the repo public or something. Can’t find any other repo on their profile that appears to be for that project either. reply lukeschaefer 1 hour agorootparentAh that's on me, it's a private repo because my code is embarrassing. But behind the scenes here's how it works: - I wrote my own scraper for HN for reasons I no longer remember - Scraper is called every 30 seconds by an Apps Script timer on a Google Sheet (to be dirt cheap, Vercel doesn't have free cron jobs). - Caches the front page, plus ten comments per post into a single Firestore document (to save money on reads vs 20 reads per load) - Home page loads via SSR with Nuxt. - Post pages will load the rest of the comments from a separate doc for each post - the other comments load instantly on navigation if on a halfway decent connection - but if not, you still get to see the first 10 comments to get an idea of the discussion while you wait. - Added some Workbox stuff to get it offline-first. - Added an IndexDB wrapper around Firestore for more control over cache behavior I think. - It's worked now for over a year with no oversight needed and not costing a penny! Then I got distracted because I wanted to rebuild it from scratch to not use Nuxt and never completed that rewrite. Been a while since I've worked on it, had no idea other people even knew it existed! There's definitely some bugs (I think CSS gets broken on deeply nested comments) but it worked enough for my uses so I moved on. reply dionian 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is pretty amazing on my fast connection. makes you realize how slow things actually are when you use something like this reply mikenew 14 hours agoparentprevWhat do you mean by Bluetooth tunnel?

However, I realized that my entire motivation for working offline was that it eliminates distraction. So it would defeat the purpose! However I'd still much rather be distracted on Wikipedia (or even HN) than other sites (esp. those with primarily images, gifs or video). I might need to segment it into \"tiers\", and have more fun parts come \"online\" as the day progresses... reply Zambyte 18 hours agorootparentThat sounds awesome. I have actually been working on something similar myself. I have been building a distributed NATS[0] cluster to funnel data down from the internet and index it locally.

Most of the time REMOTE, but, generally we like to meet up 2-3 times a year for a few weeks in a nice location. We make software for learning languages. The focus is on making tools, rather than content. It's a competitive field. That means understanding learners' needs, and relentlessly applying ingenuity and resourcefulness to make something of value. We manage well though, and the financial side is solid. We run bare metal servers at Hetzner, and a number of big GPU machines in Bulgaria. Salaries are ~Western European. Additionally, special effort will not be unrewarded. I can help arrange an EU Blue Card / VISA if needed. Bulgaria is Schengen now, taxes among the lowest in the EU, lots of mountains and pine trees, cost of living still relatively low. No hard rules around work hours or vacation. If you are reliably helping the project progress, and are available during critical weeks, I don't mind what time you drink your coffee or what timezone you are in. As a minimum: -- Thoroughly comfortable writing Typescript (or experience with similar language) -- Familiarity with HTML/CSS -- ..and linux terminal. There's a substantial amount of mostly decent code, some even pretty good. It will take some time to become familiar. Noone will be standing over your shoulder, you need to be able to make yourself useful. You will be creating new features. Somewhat open-ended, rather than just taking bug tickets. Things need to be polished and hardened before launch, and some older code needs rewriting from time to time. Other skills that would be highly useful: -- Backend skills (linux admin, ZFS backups, postgres tuning etc.) -- Knowledge around ML/DL, Python, NLP, fine-tuning LLMs, ASR and TTS. -- Strong React and CSS skills (we use MUI for our website, and have an unfinished RN Tamagui prototype). -- Doing some server hardware maintenance or upgrades (server hardware is mostly like PC hardware with some extra bits). -- Not adverse to occasional travel to meet a potential collaborator, or some occasional non-code work. -- Experience or connections in highschool/university language education. -- Knowledge of languages, particularly East Asian. -- Electronics design and manufacture (yes).

What kept you motivated to continue building this when similar tools available? reply darrylb42 3 hours agoprevLooks cool. What is the benefit of registering? I skipped it to try it out. Was very quick looking at my local MySql database. I liked being able to run sql against some local parquet files. Would need to support Redshift via an ssh tunnel for me to use it on a regular basis. I don't want to manage the tunnel with a different tool. reply RadiozRadioz 2 hours agoparentI think SSH tunnels are exactly the type of thing that should be handled by a different tool. It's a lot of complexity to add to the app, when the app (and any DB client) inherently already supports connecting via an externally managed tunnel. An established tunnel managing program, or just your terminal, would be better at managing tunnels than a tunnel tool tacked onto this app, and the interoperability is already free. Tunnels have so many configuration options that you'd either have to support raw configuration in the app (at that point just DIY a tunnel in the terminal), implement something incomplete, or build a full featured SSH tunnel manager into the app. SSH tunnels can be totally transparent to DB clients. Unlike DB application-layer stuff like credentials, where the DB client needs knowledge of them, I don't see the cost/benefit of integrating SSH tunnels into the app itself. reply hnlmorg 55 minutes agorootparentNo reason why you couldn’t call the ssh binary if it’s available in $PATH. I’ve seen other tools do this too. You’d need to be transparent in your GUI wording that this is forking SSH (in the case of Windows users) but it wouldn’t be an issue for Linux or macOS. reply RyanHamilton 2 hours agoparentprevCurrently registration is eventually enforced. I need to remove some logic to make it restricted to only happen for one niche database as I use the email to reach out to large finance firms to finance the dev effort. >>Would need to support Redshift via an ssh tunnel for me to use it on a regular basis. Redshift has definitely moved up the priority list lately. I will look into it. reply numlocked 5 hours agoprevHi - I am trying to run this on an Intel Mac. I got it to launch once, and attempted to open a small (~30mb) sqlite DB, and got a crash. It now hangs/freezes as soon as the application opens (taking over > a full core of CPU e.g. 120% plus utilization in Activity Monitor), even after deleting and re-downloading the .jar file. Any ideas? Would love to check this out! edit: Apple silicon, which I note because the process type in activity monitor is 'Intel' reply numlocked 5 hours agoparentAh! I figured it out. User error. I had hit \"open file\" instead of \"open database\" and the application decided to open the 30mb sqlite DB as text (e.g. a sql query), including syntax highlighting. Simply letting it grind away for 10 minutes or so allowed it actually open the file, at which point I could close the tab and performance is back to normal. Look forward to experimenting! reply jchw 4 hours agorootparentHey, that's some amazing QA work. If I were the developer, I'd add a quick check to see if the file appears to be a SQLite database and do something useful in that case. reply RyanHamilton 2 hours agorootparentprevThanks for letting me know and great QA.

Year 2 - Cleaning it up enough to promote wider use. Documentation. Years 3-5 - Minor bug fixes only as I thought qStudio solved the problem. Years 6 - I realised restricting qStudio to only 1-2 database technologies was foolish. Major change to support many more databases. Improved generic SQL highlighting. Added a partial dark mode. Years 7-8 - Minor bug fixes. Year 9 - Added a proper Dark Mode and support for many themes by using FlatLaf. Now looking properly modern. Year 10 - Realise that I'm not fully solving the problem. That actually for most data analysts I should support creating the analysis (pivot table) and improve exporting (real excel export, not just nicely escaped CSV). There were more learnings, like I should definitely have went fully open source at the start.

The title makes it seem like it took you ten years to release a first version, but the website says it’s version 3.0 and claims it’s “the leading SQL Editor […]”¹.

After that mostly useless changes in the readme, even the \"bugfixes\" do the same (nothing). reply hoistbypetard 4 hours agoprevCongrats on launching! I haven't gotten very far into it, but here's a little feedback about what it took to get to the point where I could try it out. 1. I'm running MacOS 14.4.1. 2. I downloaded the jar file. 3. I double-clicked the jar file. It wouldn't open. I've seen this before, so I navigated to the jar file, right-clicked it and chose open, and it gave me the option to launch it even though it was unsigned after a warning. 4. Then it told me I needed a java runtime, and I should go to java.com to get one. 5. I went to java.com to get one, downloaded the java 8 runtime things defaulted to, and when I went to install it, I got a scary warning that Oracle might sue me if I used this for commercial use. This is my personal machine, but I didn't know what might count as commercial use, so I noped out and decided to look for an open source runtime. 6. I figured out that `brew install java` seemed like what I want and ran that. 7. Once that completed, I double-clicked the jar again. No luck. 8. Since the SQL editor site advised running from the command line if double-clicking didn't work, I tried that. An error message directed me to java.com. 9. I didn't want to go back there, so I did more web searches. I learned that if I ran `sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk` things might work. So I tried that and went back to right-click the jar and run it. I again accepted the warning. It launched! 10. It asked me for an email address. I just wanted to try out the software, not sign up for email. I declined to enter one. 11. It asked me for a license code. I declined to enter one. 12. Then it told me I was in a 30 day trial mode once the GUI came up. I'm still interested, but that's the end of my timebox today. I hope I remember to come back and try it some more. But what's the deal? Is it a 30 day trial for a paid product? Or is it really free? Or do you need email to make it really free? You might want to look at how JetBrains bundles the JRE with datagrip on Mac. The level of effort needed to try this was maybe higher than I'd consider ideal. reply RyanHamilton 1 hour agoparentMassive thanks for this. I've opened an issue to ensure I improve this: https://github.com/timeseries/qstudio/issues/54 To be honest I've delayed improving Mac as I don't use the platform myself so I don't know how people usually install java apps on mac. I guess it's time I dove in and properly solved this. With the upcoming windows spyware I may have to move platform anyway. reply tt_dev 2 hours agoparentprevVery helpful - TY reply PaulHoule 4 hours agoprevYet to find one of these (Microsoft SQL's query editor, Oracle's query editor, DBeaver, pgadmin 4) that I really like. The basic problem I have is that the structure of the typical relational db which uses primary and foreign keys (even if they aren't declared) is a graph. A user interface that lets me pick out individual tables and columns for one little query tab which gets lost in a sea of tabs just doesn’t cut it. (I need to see the whole graph relevant to a problem on the screen at once, not just look at it through a keyhole… Even very smart autocomplete isn’t that big of an advantage over editing SQL in vim and using another window to look at the schema) Practically I am often understanding how to write certain queries by starting out with a certain table or a certain row and then looking at the resulting subgraphs of tables or rows that are linked to it. I want to be able to bookmark a row and come back to it immediately. Also tools like this also implement \"save\" in a way that is useless at best and sadistic at worst. Who really saves a bunch of SQL files in a directory like \"Query001.sql\"? If I want to \"save\" queries and updates I don't want to save them in a strange SQL-specific project. Depending on my project these are either going to be incorporated inside source code files or possibly saved in files that live inside a project I manage with a non-SQL IDE. If I want to \"save\" DDL these are either saved in the database themselves by executed or could be managed as part of a migration system, which I haven't seen a tool of this sort support. Although I never \"save\" files in that kind of tool, it is certain to try to stop me from turning my computer off so it is another thing that makes turning my computer off like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyOEwiQhzMI reply RyanHamilton 1 hour agoparentIt's interesting to hear your perspective thanks. FYI there is no need to save before shutdown. I stole notepad++s excellent idea of autosaving regularly. Edit: Actually your description reminded me of jailer: https://github.com/Wisser/Jailer Does that do what you want? reply Svetlitski 5 hours agoprevI have a genuine question, intended in good faith: why? Why spend 10 years working on this, only to give it way for free? reply RyanHamilton 1 hour agoparentI originally built it for myself to use with one niche database that had no IDE support at all. I then gave it to my team and then others. Years ago I began to sell it and I still have large banks and finance firms that pay to use it with that one database. Adding support for other databases was actually very little effort however I don't want to have to do the much harder work of: a) Marketing to those users. b) Competing with excellent paid alternatives. c) The various hassle of support / payment processing for many smaller firms. So the large finance firms pay me for the one niche database supported, everyone else gets it free but \"unsupported\". If a major bank that pays emails a problem, I may have to log in even from holiday to fix it.

Ok, so the big political economy news of the week was obviously Donald Trump’s conviction on the charge of falsifying business records, even as he is on track to become the Republican Presidential nominee. I don’t have anything to add here that you can’t access in any ordinary political trade magazine or news program, but it’s important to flag it since the election will have significant consequences on market power questions. In the round-up below, you’ll notice increase news about what Trump is saying he’ll do on monopoly issues. In a far less-noticed law enforcement action, the FBI this week conducted a dawn raid of corporate landlord giant Cortland Management over what’s called algorithmic price-fixing. This corporate real estate management firm, based in Atlanta, rents out 85,000 units across thirteen states. But Cortland is allegedly part of a much bigger conspiracy orchestrated by a software and consulting firm named RealPage to increase rents nationwide by coordinating landlord pricing decisions and holding apartments off the market. How much bigger? Well, there’s a civil antitrust action in Tennessee that’s been going on since 2023, where the argument is that RealPage has been working with at least 21 large landlords and institutional investors, encompassing 70% of multi-family apartment buildings and 16 million units nationwide, to systematically push up rents. And RealPage isn’t just some software company distorting rental markets, it’s also owned by Thoma Bravo, one of the biggest private equity firms in the U.S. So yeah, this scandal matters. (RealPage is also lobbying up, which politically connected firms do…) How does the cartel allegedly work? Well large corporate landlords, who would normally compete with one another for tenants via price or quality, have since 2016 stopped doing so. Instead, they all share “detailed real-time data regarding pricing, inventory, occupancy rates, and unit types that are or will be coming available to rent” every day with one another through RealPage’s revenue management system, which in turn sends back recommendations on pricing. Landlords adopt RealPage recommendations on pricing 80-90% of the time, which explicitly drives up revenue by holding apartments off the market. As the architect of RealPage once explained, “[i]f you have idiots undervaluing, it costs the whole system.” It’s not just an information-sharing and price recommendation engine. RealPage has ‘pricing advisors’ that monitor landlords and encourage them to accept suggested pricing, it works to get employees at landlord companies fired who try to move rents lower, and it even threatens to drop clients who don’t accept its high price recommendations. This one’s a very clear conspiracy. Allegedly. Cortland is located in Atlanta, where 81% of multifamily rental unit prices are set via software. And rent in that city has exploded, up 80% since 2016. What’s odd about this price increase is that vacancy rates have been inching up, and when there’s more supply, prices should come down. But they aren’t. What seems to have happened in the period between 2015-2017 is that a bunch of landlords started using RealPage pricing recommendations. Then in 2017, RealPage bought its main rival, Lease Rent Option, giving it perfect information into the supply and demand for apartment rentals. Here’s a map of Atlanta properties using RealPage’s software. The Department of Justice is clearly deep in an investigation of RealPage and its cartel. And this one looks criminal. It’s also fascinating that the FBI is involved. The FBI, though historically it had a big role in antitrust investigations for its first hundred years, hasn’t really done much in this area since the early 2000s. I don’t know what conclusions to draw from that. But I’ll be watching. And now for the good and bad news of the week. One item of note involves BIG. Last year, I investigated and wrote up Equifax's monopoly over income verification. That argument has now turned into a class action antitrust suit by mortgage lenders against the credit bureau.

I’m skeptical that analysis reports telling landlords to raise rent are illegal, but writing in the contract that you have to follow the rules of the association is obvious collusion/cartel behavior. reply mjcl 58 minutes agoparentI worked for a company that started using YieldStar back in 2006 and at least back then there was no contractual requirement to use the recommended prices. RealPage did heavily push the idea that you needed to work within YieldStar at all times. If a manager disagreed with a recommended price, our in-house revenue management would work with the manager to see if there is a configuration error in YieldStar (wrong amenities, wrong unit type, wrong target vacancy, etc). If there isn't a configuration error, then the recommended price would usually stand. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agoparentprevYep, on one level it could just be automating the task of scanning Zillow and other sites and seeing what other landlords are asking. Any landlord is going to be doing that to some degree. But the price-fixing amongst \"competing\" landlords is where it goes wrong. reply phkahler 1 hour agorootparent>> But the price-fixing amongst \"competing\" landlords is where it goes wrong.

In LA, you used to have a ton of extremely cheap studio apartments. We're talking $600 for a nice studio apartment with its own bathroom, you had SROs as well which while not luxury apartments, provided housing. But the vast majority of this housing stock was very old and created before there was thousands upon thousands of regulations, for example most apartments in Los Angeles need to be constructed with parking. You have to have a certain amount of outdoor space, etc. So you end up having housing cost twice as much as it really needs to . It's really sad too, because just 15 years ago or so you could have a minimum wage job and afford your own place. Now that's not really obtainable anywhere in the United States. I've met tons of young adults, some even ranging into their 30s who have really bad home lives but can't afford to move out . Solutions to this are often really short-sighted, you have affordable housing units going up which are costing $600 to $700,000 for the city to build. Obviously this just doesn't work so you have a bizarre lottery system just to have a roof over your head. Personally I think the solution would be a combination of subsidized high speed rail and an aggressive rethinking of what a town needs to be. Imagine being able to hop on a high speed train that goes about 150 miles an hour. You could have a community of affordable housing that's a short train ride away from San Francisco, LA, or any other unaffordable city.

It’s zoning, it’s environmental review, it’s historic/landmark review, it’s good neighbor agreements, it’s disorganized and/or corrupt permitting departments, etc. All of this gets weaponized against new supply. Ultimately. City electeds answer to voters, not builders, so they get the government they deserve. Some places are building, adding supply, and consequently lowering prices.

Here is the FTC and DoJ's explanation of algorithmic price-fixing: https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/YardiSOI-filed%... Some quotes: > concerted action can take many forms—including, inter alia, competitors’ jointly delegating key aspects of their decisionmaking to a common algorithm, because doing so “joins together separate decisionmakers” and thus “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking.” > As technology has developed in the 133 years since the Sherman Act created a federal prohibition on price fixing, firms have evolved the mechanisms they use for reaching unlawful price-fixing agreements. In-person handshakes gave way to phone and fax, and later to email. Algorithms are the new frontier. And, given the amount of information an algorithm can access and digest, this new frontier poses an even greater anticompetitive threat than the last. > The question in this case is whether the defendants have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by allegedly knowingly combining their sensitive, nonpublic pricing and supply information in an algorithm that they rely upon in making pricing decisions, with the knowledge and expectation that other competitors will do the same. Although not every use of an algorithm to set price qualifies as a per se violation of Section 1, taking the allegations set forth in the complaints as true, the alleged scheme meets the legal criteria for per se unlawful price fixing. (emphasis mine) > To begin, the complaints allege that RealPage’s proposal “contemplated” and “invited” concerted action among the landlords. In fact, its “intent to create coordination among users,” including its “aim” of “increasing revenues by raising rents,” was “transparent to all.” Among other things, RealPage required each user to submit real-time pricing and supply data to it, and RealPage’s marketing materials allegedly “touted” its use of “non-public data from other RealPage clients,” enabling them to “raise rents in concert”; as well as the algorithms’ ability to “facilitate collaboration among operations” and “track your competition’s rent with precision.” > Indeed, the complaints also contain ample allegations on how RealPage directly constrained the “deviations” from its suggested prices, including by enforcing and monitoring compliance with those prices, so the landlords effectively delegated aspects of their pricing decisions to RealPage. > Indeed, RealPage allegedly touted this feature—stating in a press release that it gives clients “the ability to ‘outsource daily pricing and ongoing revenue oversight,’” such that RealPage could “set prices” as though it “own[ed]” the clients’ properties “ourselves.’” You can think of RealPage's role as a facilitator that gathers competitors together and says \"let me set all of your prices, if enough of you agree then you won't need to compete and we'll all make a lot of money together.\" That is illegal under antitrust law. reply prophesi 1 hour agorootparentI like the way Maureen K.

However, if what the complaint says about the advisors is true, then I think that is a much stronger case. reply bombcar 1 hour agoparentprevAs a landlord, you want to know what to price your rental so it rents relatively quickly. You need to know the \"fair market rent\" for the unit. If you're familiar with the area, do your research, and have some experience, you can get a number pretty quickly. RealPage offered to do that work for you - but once they are doing for a certain percentage of the market in an area, they become controlling of that market, and you can get \"harmonic errors\" that don't get corrected, because they control too much of the supply pricing. reply pixl97 1 hour agoparentprev> Realpage should just be concerned with keeping their saas customers by making a good product.

As the architect of RealPage once explained, “[i]f you have idiots undervaluing, it costs the whole system.” It’s not just an information-sharing and price recommendation engine. RealPage has ‘pricing advisors’ that monitor landlords and encourage them to accept suggested pricing, it works to get employees at landlord companies fired who try to move rents lower, and it even threatens to drop clients who don’t accept its high price recommendations. This one’s a very clear conspiracy. Allegedly. This raid is potentially glorious. Faith in the system tentatively renewed. I'll keep my fingers crossed for not only certain parties going to prison, but also certain parties being forced to compensate for the huge harm to entire markets and the people in them that they knowingly caused. (IIUC, if a lot of owners collude to manipulate prices, then the rest will also tend go up, because they notice the new \"market\" price, and they see their costs are going up. And then this has other economic effects, including payroll and retention for small businesses. And presumably also the various costs to society of health and happiness problems, since the economic stresses can be pretty bad for some.) reply toyg 1 hour agoparentI doubt much punishment will actually happen, beyond some nominal reparations; but it could establish a legacy in the field of SaaS antitrust, which could cool down some of the worst animal instincts in the market. reply Apreche 1 hour agoprevIs there a source for this story? reply settsu 1 hour agoprevWhile this seems like a legal (and moral/ethical) win, I can't help assume there will be no meaningful justice for anyone directly affected by the conspiracy.

It wasn't this video, but very similar (he swears at the 1:35 mark so use headphones if needed): https://www.tiktok.com/@newsforthought/video/715903134243979... What's going on is that Vanguard, BlackRock and (other?) private equity firms have bought up huge swaths of real estate in the US as secure investments. This started around 20 years ago when financial advisers like Suze Orman recommended Vanguard as a vehicle for retirement savings alongside a 401k, Roth IRA, etc: https://www.suzeorman.com/resources/mutual-funds https://www.oprah.com/money/financial-freedom-by-suze-orman (2008) Now during a slow housing market, private equity firms are holding land and housing, rather than selling for a loss like banks did when the 2008 housing bubble popped. Due to a weak economy post-pandemic, inflation driven by corporate greed to prevent losses by the wealthy during those ~2 years that labor stayed home from the workplace, and high interest rates which resulted from the Federal Reserve trying to slow that inflation. Their infinite holds have resulted in record high rents and mortgages due to low volatility from lack of competition. Depending on how the presidential election goes, and if there's a recession or stagflation in the following year(s), private equity firms will likely find themselves under increasingly high pressure to sell and free up capital to pay their investors dividends. Then private equity firms may go to the federal government for a bailout just like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did. Basically Gen X, Millennials and Gen Z on Main Street will be asked to bail out private equity firms on Wall Street to save the retirements of Boomers. The key difference between the Housing Bubble popping and today being that people under 50 have been under the yoke this whole millennium: underemployed, working excessive hours and multiple jobs while being denied raises/savings/retirements and even having their social safety net slowly dismantled (for example the unemployment work search requirement used to deny benefits after the mid-2000s) since the economy became financialized after the 2000 Dot Bomb. At every turn, rather than investing in stuff like automation and renewable energy, prioritizing work/life balance like in Scandinavian countries, or even promoting unions/guilds/cooperatives, the US outsourced 100,000 factories under the GW Bush Administration and stonewalled nearly all pro-labor programs under the Obama Administration. Leaving us with a monopolized and duopolized economy that nickel and dimes working people and blocks them from participating in capital investment by labeling low-dollar trades as \"pattern day trading\" in 2001, for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader After a lifetime of exploitation, it's a bit like the Lannisters having to go to the Iron Bank when their gold mines stopped producing. Or billionaires who can't find where all of the money went, begging young people for their last penny so their grandparents can retire in dignity. It.. raises some eyebrows to say the least. RealPage may be the first in a long chain of dominoes that leads to young people having real leverage over moneyed interests. It will be curious to see how they respond - whether they bow to the status quo or organize to demand structural changes in the economy like during the Progressive Era, New Deal and post-WWII economic expansion before trickle-down Reaganomics flatlined wages as productivity increased after 1980. reply gruez 47 minutes agoparent>Leaving us with a monopolized and duopolized economy that nickel and dimes working people and blocks them from participating in capital investment by labeling low-dollar trades as \"pattern day trading\" in 2001, for example: >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader wtf are you talking about?

This notion that homelessness is primarily driven by high rents stands up to zero scrutiny. Especially visible homelessness as in, the people you see sleeping on the street. That is driven by other public health epidemics such as drug addiction and untreated mental health issues. It’s important to get this right, or we won’t be able to solve either of these problems (skyrocketing rents & homelessness). reply vineyardmike 1 hour agorootparent> homelessness is primarily driven by high rents It stands up both to intellectual review and research studies. It’s a very clear idea that higher rents are harder to pay for, so it’s more likely you can’t pay. It’s conceptually sound AND backed by research. > Especially visible homelessness In many parts of the country visible homelessness is a small fraction of the total homelessness. For example, historically Boston had 5% of the homeless population on the street. Homelessness doesn’t look like what people see. For every homeless person laying on the sidewalk having a health crisis there are 10-20 more people in homeless shelters or cars. This is where the homeless families are. If you have bad luck (eg medical expenses, car crash etc) and suddenly can’t afford rent, high rents make it hard to get enough money to bridge that gap. This is a real risk for low-income workers - one surprise bill could easily deplete savings and risk not paying rent. If you’re just irresponsible or handicapped and can’t work full time (eg mental health issues, physical health issues) and have trouble maintaining income and savings, then expensive rent makes it more likely you won’t earn enough any given month. Hell, if you’re a drug addict and barely able to hold a job and always looking for your fix, high rent makes it harder to find a slummy house to get out of the rain.

There could be any number of explanations for why two things increased in the same time period without one causing the other. reply llamaimperative 50 minutes agorootparentWhat GP said is it stands up \"to zero scrutiny.\" That is an absolutely absurd claim. There is a mountain of evidence pointing to exactly this. Sure, correlation vs causation blah blah. This correlation persists even when controlling for most other variables people can think of: > A large body of academic research has consistently found that homelessness in an area is driven by housing costs, whether expressed in terms of rents, rent-to-income ratios, price-to-income ratios, or home prices. Further, changes in rents precipitate changes in rates of homelessness: homelessness increases when rents rise by amounts that low-income households cannot afford. Similarly, interventions to address housing costs by providing housing directly or through subsidies have been effective in reducing homelessness. That makes sense if housing costs are the main driver of homelessness, but not if other reasons are to blame. Studies show that other factors have a much smaller impact on homelessness. > Much of the research looks at the variation in homelessness among geographies and finds that housing costs explain far more of the difference in rates of homelessness than variables such as substance use disorder, mental health, weather, the strength of the social safety net, poverty, or economic conditions. Some vulnerabilities strongly influence which people are susceptible to homelessness, but research has repeatedly concluded that these factors play only a minor role in driving rates of homelessness compared with the role of housing costs.

This information is being voluntarily shared in order to manipulate the market - that is, they broker horizontal collusion between players in a vertical industry. A group of landlords calling each other to say \"we're going to make sure the vacancy rate stays at 5.5% this year\" or \"hey let's make sure we don't let these units go for under market value even though they're empty\" would also be illegal collusion, it's just being laundered through an algorithm. This is the big smoking gun that makes it a hub-and-spoke price fixing ring (also called vertically integrated horizontal collusion - ie, a cartel). There's also the part where RealPage bought their main large-scale competitor, Lease Rent Options (who claimed to use only public data, in contrast to RealPage), in a 2017 deal that probably shouldn't have passed antitrust review, so there isn't anyone else to blame (they also own Buildium). reply infecto 1 hour agoparentprev- RealPage has the majority of the market for big property owners. - RealPage makes the price increases opt-out with required justification. reply dudeinjapan 1 hour agoprevRent-seeking, pun intended. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agoprev [–] Anyone here working on tech for RealPage?

It has been almost six years since the first source code was written for the project back in 2018, and a lot has happened since: There are now over 300 000 lines of C++ engine code, over 42 000 commits and almost 4 000 issues were opened and closed again. DuckDB has also gained significant popularity: the project has attracted tens of thousands of stars and followers on GitHub and social media platforms. Download counts are in the millions each month, and download traffic just for extensions is upwards of four terabytes each day. There are even books being written about DuckDB, and – most importantly – now even Wikipedia considers DuckDB notable, albeit barely. Why now? Of course, version numbers are somewhat arbitrary and “feely”, despite attempts at making them more mechanical. We could have released DuckDB 1.0.0 back in 2018, or we could have waited ten more years. There is never a great moment, because software (with the exception of TeX) is never “done”. Why choose today? Data management systems – even purely analytical ones – are such core components of any application that there is always an implicit contract of trust between their developers and users. Users rely on databases to provide correct query results and to not lose their data. At the same time, system developers need to be aware of their responsibility of not breaking people’s applications willy-nilly. Intuitively, version 1.0.0 means something else for a data management system than it means for an egg timer app (no offense). From the very beginning, we were committed to making DuckDB a reliable base for people to build their applications on. This is also why the 1.0.0 release is named after the non-existent snow duck (anas nivis), harking back to Apple’s Snow Leopard release some years ago. For us, one of the major blockers to releasing 1.0.0 was the storage format. DuckDB has its own custom-built data storage format. This format allows users to manage many (possibly very large) tables in a single file with full transactional semantics and state-of-the-art compression. Of course, designing a new file format is not without its challenges, and we had to make significant changes to the format over time. This led to the suboptimal situation that whenever a new DuckDB version was released, the files created with the old version did not work with the new DuckDB version and had to be manually upgraded. This problem was addressed in v0.10.0 back in February – where we introduced backward compatibility and limited forward compatibility for DuckDB’s storage format. This feature has now been used in the wild for a while without serious issues – providing us with the confidence to offer a guarantee that DuckDB files created with DuckDB 1.0.0 will be compatible with future DuckDB versions. Stability The core theme of the 1.0.0 release is stability. This contrasts it with previous releases where we have had blog posts talk about long lists of new features. Instead, the 1.0.0 release has very limited new features (a few might have snuck in). Instead, our focus has been on stability. We’ve observed the frankly staggering growth in the amount and breadth of use of DuckDB in the wild, and have not seen an increase in serious issues being reported. Meanwhile, there are thousands of test cases with millions of test queries being run every night. We run loads of microbenchmarks and standardized benchmark suites to spot performance regressions. DuckDB is constantly being tortured by various fuzzers that construct all manners of wild SQL queries to make sure we don’t miss weird corner cases. All told, this has built the necessary confidence in us to release a 1.0.0. Another core aspect of stability with the 1.0.0 release is stability across versions. While never breaking anyone’s workflow is likely impossible, we plan to be much more careful with user-facing changes going forward. In particular, we plan to focus on providing stability for the SQL dialect, as well as the C API. While we do not guarantee that we will never change semantics in these layers in the future – we will try to provide ample warning when doing so, as well as providing workarounds that allow previously working code to keep on working. Looking ahead Unlike many open-source projects, DuckDB also has a healthy long-term funding strategy. DuckDB Labs, the company that employs DuckDB’s core contributors, has not had any outside investments, and as a result, the company is fully owned by the team. Labs’ business model is to provide consulting and support services for DuckDB, and we’re happy to report that this is going well. With the revenue from contracts, we fund long-term and strategic DuckDB development with a team of almost 20 people. At the same time, the intellectual property in the project is guarded by the independent DuckDB Foundation. This non-profit foundation ensures that DuckDB will be around long-term under the MIT license. Regarding long-term plans, there are, of course, many things on the roadmap still. One thing we’re very excited about is the ability to expand the extension environment around DuckDB. Extensions are plug-ins that can add new SQL-level functions, file formats, optimizers, etc. while keeping the DuckDB core mean and lean. There are already an impressive number of third-party extensions to DuckDB, and we’re working hard to streamline the process of building and distributing community-contributed extensions. We think DuckDB can become the basis for the next revolution in data through community extensions connected by a high-performance data fabric accessible through a unified SQL interface. Of course, there will be issues found in today’s release. But rest assured, there will be a 1.0.1 release. There will be a 1.1.0. And there might also be a 2.0.0 at some point. We’re in this for the long run, all of us, together. We have the team and the structures and resources to do so. Acknowledgements First of all, we are very, very grateful to you all. Our massive and heartfelt thanks go to everyone who has contributed code, filed issues or engaged in discussions, promoted DuckDB in their environment, and, of course, all DuckDB users. We could not have done it without you! We would also like to thank the CWI Database Architectures group for providing us with the environment and expertise to build DuckDB, the organizations that provided us with research grants early on, the excellent customers of DuckDB Labs that make it all work (especially the early ones), and the generous donors to the DuckDB Foundation. We are particularly grateful to our long-standing Gold sponsors MotherDuck, Voltron Data and Posit. Finally, we would like to thank the excellent and amazing team at DuckDB Labs. So join us now in being nostalgic, teary-eyed and excited for what’s to come for DuckDB and celebrate the release of DuckDB 1.0.0 with us. We certainly will. Mark and Hannes PS: We are holding our next community event, DuckCon #5, in Seattle on August 15, only a few short weeks from today. Attendance is free. Hope to see you there!

I can't imagine a better, practical structure: DuckDB Labs: The core contributors. Instead of developing features that will be behind a paywall, they provide support and consulting. Awesome. DuckDB Foundation: A non-profit that ensures DuckDB remains MIT licensed. Perfect. We actually just published a post on how to replace your warehouse with DuckDB.

Thanks for your benchmarking! Your blog does a great job contrasting the two use cases. I don't think too much has changed on your main use case, however here are a few ideas to test out! DuckDB can read SQLite files now! So if you like DuckDB syntax or query optimization, but want to use the SQLite format / indexes, that may work well. Since DuckDB is columnar (and compressed), it frequently needs to read a big chunk of rows (~100K) just to get 1 row out and decompressed. Mind trying to store your data uncompressed?

Zewude, Kenneth Croitoru, Ronit Das, Brian Goldman and Isaac I. Bogoch CMAJ June 03, 2024 196 (21) E724-E727; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.231319 Article Figures & Tables Related Content Responses Metrics PDF KEY POINTS Auto-brewery syndrome involves endogenous alcohol fermentation by fungi in the gut. Diagnostic evaluation includes collateral history, ethanol level measurements with an oral glucose challenge, and, potentially, fungal culture and susceptibility testing of gastrointestinal secretions. Management involves longitudinal, multidisciplinary care involving specialists in primary care, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, and mental health, as well as dietitians, with a strategy of antifungal therapy and a low-carbohydrate diet. Auto-brewery syndrome may carry substantial social, legal, occupational, and medical consequences for patients, and awareness of this syndrome is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. A 50-year-old woman was referred to a gastroenterology clinic after 7 presentations over the previous 2 years to emergency departments (EDs) with alcohol intoxication despite her report of no alcohol consumption. Over the preceding 5 years, she had had recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which required frequent courses of ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin, as well as gastrointestinal reflux disease, treated with dexlansoprazole. In the past, she would drink a glass of wine at holidays; however, in recent years, she had stopped drinking altogether because of her religious beliefs. She lived with her husband and children. Two years previously, the patient started to have excessive somnolence and episodes of falling asleep suddenly while getting ready for work or preparing meals. She presented to her family physician several times with excessive somnolence and to EDs with slurred speech, the smell of alcohol on her breath, and falls caused by somnolence. On her ED visits, she was discharged with the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication, despite her reports of no alcohol intake, corroborated by her family. During her initial ED visit, her alcohol level was elevated at 39 (normal < 2) mmol/L, with normal liver enzymes. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of her head showed no acute intracranial findings. During subsequent ED visits, she had 3 separate assessments by psychiatrists who provided care related to addiction medicine at the hospital. During these assessments, she scored zero on the CAGE (Cut, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye) screening questionnaire for alcohol use disorder. Notably, during her third ED visit, she received certification under the Mental Health Act (Form 1), as the treating emergency physician had concerns for self-neglect when the patient initiated discharge before psychiatry assessment. After each ED visit, the patient needed 1–2 weeks off work because of persistent lethargy and somnolence. During this time at home, she ate little, given her suppressed appetite from somnolence. Her lethargy would then resolve over 1–2 weeks, with subsequent improvement in appetite. Her lethargy and somnolence recurred in an episodic manner every 1–2 months thereafter. On her seventh ED visit, the patient presented with slurred speech, alcohol odour on her breath, and an elevated ethanol level of 62 mmol/L. A diagnosis of auto-brewery syndrome was considered by the emergency physician, who prescribed oral fluconazole (100 mg, twice daily) and sent a gastroenterology referral. At the gastroenterology clinic, the patient was assessed by a dietitian, who suggested a low-carbohydrate diet (Table 1). A CT enterography scan did not show any small bowel pathology indicative of stasis or microbial overgrowth. After completing a 1-month course of fluconazole and adhering to the low-carbohydrate diet, her symptoms resolved and remained absent for 4 months. The patient then started increasing her carbohydrate intake. One month after increasing carbohydrate intake, she had recurrence of slurred speech and drowsiness, which led to a fall. She was reassessed in the gastroenterology clinic, restarted on fluconazole, advised to revert to the low-carbohydrate diet, and referred to our infectious diseases clinic. After 2 weeks of fluconazole and a low-carbohydrate diet, her symptoms resolved. View this table: View inline View popup Table 1: The low-carbohydrate diet prepared by a dietitian for a 50-year-old woman with auto-brewery syndrome On consultation with the patient in our infectious diseases clinic, we agreed with the diagnosis of auto-brewery syndrome based on her recurrent intoxication presentations with elevated ethanol levels and consistent self- and corroborated reporting of no alcohol consumption. Moreover, the complete resolution of symptoms and absence of detectable alcohol levels after treatment with fluconazole and a low-carbohydrate diet provided additional support for the diagnosis. We stopped the patient’s fluconazole after 6 weeks because of symptom resolution and an elevated alanine transaminase level of 217 (normal 17–631) IU/L, attributed to the fluconazole. Her alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels remained normal. A gastroenterologist performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy 3 days after she completed the fluconazole course. Fungal cultures from duodenal and terminal ileum aspirates showed no growth; however, the likelihood of isolating fungi in cultures obtained after the course of fluconazole was low. We started the patient on Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotics to replenish gut microbiota. To reduce further gut dysbiosis, we advised the patient and her family physician to use narrow-spectrum antibiotics only after confirming a UTI diagnosis with urine culture and compatible symptoms. The patient remained asymptomatic for 6 months, after which we conducted an oral glucose challenge test to evaluate the safety of carbohydrate consumption. She was given 150 g of oral glucose after we determined an undetectable baseline level of ethanol. Subsequent measurements taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 24, and 48 hours after glucose intake showed no detectable ethanol levels (< 2 mmol/L). Based on these results, we advised her to gradually increase her carbohydrate intake, and she will continue follow-up with our infectious diseases clinic, the gastroenterologist, and the dietitian. Discussion Auto-brewery syndrome is a rare syndrome of endogenous alcohol fermentation. A 1948 report of a boy with a ruptured stomach whose contents smelled of alcohol was the first to describe gut fermentation.1 Auto-brewery syndrome as a diagnostic entity was first described in 1952 in Japan, where it bears the layman term Meitei-sho, which translates as “alcohol auto-intoxication syndrome.” 2 The first cases in North America were published in the United States in the 1980s.3,4 A 2020 systematic review identified 20 patients reported in the English medical literature since 1974.5 Auto-brewery syndrome is thought to result when microorganisms capable of fermenting alcohol from carbohydrates outgrow normal gut flora.6 Although population-based studies have shown that gut alcohol fermentation with low levels of endogenous ethanol can occur even among healthy people, blood ethanol levels rarely reach concentrations high enough to cause intoxication.7 Auto-brewery syndrome is uncommon because it requires several host factors to interact with substantial overpopulation of fermenting microorganisms, and high carbohydrate consumption.6 Comorbidities such as diabetes, liver disease, gut dysmotility disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease are associated with auto-brewery syndrome through mechanisms contributing to increased levels of blood glucose and decreased ethanol metabolism.6,7 Genetic predisposition for inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme and subsequent inefficient alcohol metabolism, may also play a role.6 In our patient, we suspect her recurrent antibiotics for UTI and dexlansoprazole use led to gut dysbiosis with potential contribution of genetics, resulting in auto-brewery syndrome. Commonly implicated fungi responsible for outgrowing normal gut flora in auto-brewery syndrome are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida species including C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata.2 Bacteria have also been cultured from patients with auto-brewery syndrome. Although the role of bacteria remains unclear, a recent case–control study proposed Klebsiella pneumoniae as an important culprit.7–9 No standardized diagnostic algorithms are available for autobrewery syndrome and years of delay to diagnosis are common. 8,9 When auto-brewery syndrome is suspected, the diagnostic framework includes performing a history (from the patient and close contacts), physical examination, blood work, glucose challenge test, and microbiological assessments (Figure 1). A CAGE screening questionnaire should be performed and blood ethanol and liver enzyme levels should be measured.3 Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint Figure 1: Diagnostic framework for suspected auto-brewery syndrome. Protocols for glucose challenges include obtaining a baseline level of ethanol from blood or via a breathalyzer, followed by ingestion of a high load (100–200 g) of glucose. Ethanol levels are obtained at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours after glucose ingestion. The glucose challenge should be conducted in a monitored setting to ensure no consumption of ethanol and safety in the event of intoxication.3,8 Undetectable ethanol levels at baseline, followed by detection of ethanol after glucose ingestion, can confirm the diagnosis. Fungal and bacterial cultures of gastrointestinal secretions obtained through esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy can help identify culprit pathogens with antimicrobial susceptibility. 3 Stool fungal cultures can also be obtained as an adjunct test.6,8 The diagnostic yield of the glucose challenge and microbiologic evaluations will decrease if these are conducted after administration of empiric antifungal agents, as with our patient. Therefore, prompt arrangements for these diagnostics are crucial when auto-brewery syndrome is suspected, as delays in treatment can prolong its physical, social, and financial ramifications. Management of auto-brewery syndrome lacks established guidelines. Antifungal therapy and low-carbohydrate diets have been the primary treatments in documented cases. If a microbiologic diagnosis is established, an antifungal agent can be chosen based on susceptibility. Otherwise, fluconazole is a reasonable empiric choice given that S. cerevisiae and C. albicans are the most commonly implicated fungi.2,7 Relapse after antifungal treatment, in the absence of dietary nonadherence, should prompt endoscopic evaluation for culture and susceptibility testing. Echinocandins, itraconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B have been successfully used in cases of relapse after fluconazole.7,8 One patient who had refractory symptoms despite trials of several antifungals received a fecal microbiota transplant with effective symptom resolution.10 Clinical and biochemical resolution of auto-brewery syndrome has been reported with 3 weeks of fluconazole (100–150 mg/d).3,7 Among patients with relapsing disease, antifungal durations of 6–8 weeks have been successful.3 In addition to antifungals, probiotics may provide benefit by replenishing gut bacteria as competitive flora to fungi.3,8 Levofloxacin therapy resolved auto-brewery syndrome in a patient in whom K. pneumoniae was identified as a culprit pathogen.9 Management of auto-brewery syndrome should include evaluation for hepatic effects of ethanol similar to those with alcohol use disorder. Auto-brewery syndrome carries substantial social, legal, and medical consequences for patients and their loved ones. Our patient had several ED visits, was assessed by internists and psychiatrists, and was certified under the Mental Health Act before receiving a diagnosis of auto-brewery syndrome, reinforcing how awareness of this syndrome is essential for clinical diagnosis and management.

I feel like auto-brewery syndrome is well known enough in pop culture that I am somewhat stunned it went so long before anyone considered the possibility. reply Workaccount2 5 hours agoparentThe core issue is that the system is just not good at catching outliers, and the only conceivable way to do so would be incredibly wasteful and expensive. For every case of \"It took 8 doctors over the course of 3 years to get a diagnosis\" there are 5000 cases of \"It took 1 doctor on one visit to get a diagnosis\" reply tivert 4 hours agorootparent> The core issue is that the system is just not good at catching outliers, and the only conceivable way to do so would be incredibly wasteful and expensive. But in this case, I don't think it would be \"incredibly wasteful and expensive.\" The case study stated, \"On her ED visits, she was discharged with the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication, despite her reports of no alcohol intake, corroborated by her family.\" She didn't need some expensive diagnostic test for a diagnosis, she needed a doctor to pay attention to what she and her family were saying. reply shermantanktop 4 hours agorootparentAnd to disregard their previous experience with high-functioning alcoholics who deny everything when they mess up. I’d bet there’s a lot more hidden day-drinkers out there than patients like this. As someone with a relatively obscure condition, I’ve gotten used to being the pachinko ball that falls straight down the diagnostic chart to the wrong conclusion. But I understand the numbers are against me. reply tivert 2 hours agorootparent> And to disregard their previous experience with high-functioning alcoholics who deny everything when they mess up. I’d bet there’s a lot more hidden day-drinkers out there than patients like this. I'd rather them disregard their bias than disregard their patients. If someone insists they don't drink when challenged with the BAC data (especially with corroboration like in this case), do a test to determine if they're lying or not. Don't just assume they're lying. But doctors often are arrogant and unwilling to admit error, even to other doctors. The best you can sometimes do in those situations is to get bossy and try to take control of the situation (e.g. I know you're assuming I'm a lying alcoholic, but I don't drink, so explain to me how I could be intoxicated without drinking...what tests would you need to prove that...), but not everyone has the confidence to do that or to do it only when it's needed. reply DoreenMichele 1 hour agorootparentWhen I was extremely sick, I was super frustrated with the 15 Minute Appointment. It was more infuriating than the things that inspired me to bitterly joke \"They majored in medicine and minored in hubris and contempt.\" Some of my big breakthroughs came in ER visits where they are a little more focused on problem solving and less on getting you out the door in time to keep to schedule. It doesn't live up to the fiction of House but sometimes if I had good rapport with an ER doctor, they took a few minutes to think about how best to keep me out of their ER in the future. This sometimes got me what a relative called \"real drugs instead of tea and sympathy.\" We have a broken system. I don't know how to fix it but some of the criticisms of specific people in the broken system implicitly assume \"These people are the problem!\" And that doesn't really fit my firsthand experience. reply nerdponx 49 minutes agorootparent> little more focused on problem solving I actually had a great ER experience along these lines. I felt bad being there after it became clear that I was going to be fine while there was a lady wailing in pain about 10 feet away, but at least I left with a lot of things to discuss with my regular doctor and I at least knew when I should/shouldn't worry in future situations. reply encoderer 3 hours agorootparentprevYes. High functioning alcoholics are not checking themselves into the emergency room 9 times over a year. reply monkeyfun 3 hours agorootparentprevShould doctors never trust their patients? What's the threshold for where doctors should begin to believe their patients' claims, as opposed to simply assuming they're merely some drug addict seeking another hit or someone lazy seeking time off work? I'm someone who's specifically had GI doctors ignore what I say so intensely as for this conversation to have seriously taken place: Me: \"The [medication] might have worked, I feel slightly better, but it was way too strong. I had nearly all the major side effects that the instructions said to contact you if I get them. Is there any smaller dose, or could I try out something else?\" GI Specialist: \"Ok, so would you like me to increase the dose? I can prescribe [double].\" Edit: meant to conclude that I think it's not just excessive distrust, and that it'd be absurd and cruel to just always distrust patients completely -- that doctors definitely seem to ignore patients heavily, especially if they're in any way abnormal. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentDoctors are human. how did the rest of conversation go? did you explain that they misunderstood what you said? Also, Did you consider just taking half the dose? reply hooverd 1 hour agorootparentThey can't be human too and make oopsie whoopsies with no repercussions while demanding unlimited deference from society. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentWhat is this \"unlimited deference\" you speak of? I dont think doctors should be elevated to some super-human status. They are human. Many of them do a tricky and socially useful job, but there is nothing magic about it or them. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentprevAnd that is the tradeoff. 99.999% of the time the person is lying, confused, or crazy. I doubt it was lack of attention, but lack of trust instead. reply op00to 35 minutes agorootparentYou get much further with crazy people by not directly challenging them. reply DoreenMichele 3 hours agorootparentprevWomen get dismissed a lot by doctors. (This is common enough knowledge I'm not going to provide citations in spite of being a woman posting on an overwhelmingly male forum. If you downvote this without doing a quick google: There's your problem.) When I was a homemaker and having serious health issues, I sometimes wore a suit to see a medical professional to try to get them to take me more seriously. I used to bitch to friends that I felt like pinning a list of my academic achievements to my lapel. \"Oh, it's a homemaker. Must be stupid! Couldn't possibly have been a good student in school! Smart women all have serious careers.\" Yeah, sure. That's reality./s reply wing-_-nuts 3 hours agorootparentIf 200 people presented with alcohol intoxication and no history of use, 199 would be secret alcoholics sneaking booze, and maybe 1 would be someone with this condition. The previous case I read about, they forced the poor guy to inpatient for weeks to rule out alcohol use. It's not just 'doctors don't believe women' it's 'doctors don't believe (probable) addicts'. reply roxya 3 hours agorootparentYeah, as a man nobody would believe me either. I was in hospital with acute pancreatitis and they found at the same time I had a fatty liver. Both are often explained by heavy alcohol intake. The truth is I hardly drank at all (I had perhaps had a single bottle of beer in the whole previous 12 months) but nobody would believe me. I ended up being told to never drink alcohol again. reply rvnx 2 hours agorootparentDid you find a solution eventually ? reply themaninthedark 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't thin this has anything to do with sex... A coworker of mine had back issues, they only took him seriously when he was brought in via ambulance because he couldn't stand a year later after multiple visits to both his GP and hospital. And they still didn't take him seriously, they were going to discharge him in a wheelchair until he pissed himself because he had lost all control of his lower body and couldn't even tell that he had to pee. White guy, steady job and good insurance. To the doctor's it look like someone trying to get pain meds. Edit to change tone reply DoreenMichele 1 hour agorootparentI'm not suggesting gender is solely and entirely The Reason. I don't think I should have to say that. But it's a factor generally for women. Which doesn't assert men always get fabulous results every time, nor does it in any way \"rebut\" points other people already made elsewhere in this discussion. I was just going to ignore the ridiculous pile on to my comment, but it's not stopping. Folks are blowing it out of proportion. Which may not stop but now I'm on record with that observation. reply adamomada 16 minutes agorootparentYou could have just posted “people get dismissed s lot by doctors” and not bring attention to your username or gender, but ya did reply DoreenMichele 9 minutes agorootparentYour comment assumes no one remembers me and no one reacts to my username and gender unless I point it out. This seems implausible to me. I wish it really were that simple. I dont think it is. Additionally, your suggestion fundamentally dismisses my main point: This is apparently a bigger issue for women than men generally. And when men act like it's unreasonable for a woman to be aware this is a bigger issue for women and to toss that detail out there in public discussion, it's just a no win situation for women. The people most impacted are routinely treated like they are whiners who should just shut up and accept that no one will bother to care. And not just about gender. People of color also routinely get treated crappily for being the ones who bring up X issue when no one else will and they bring it up because they are the ones aware of it. jamesblonde 2 hours agorootparentprevNo downvote from me. My wife did her Univerity thesis on this topic, and it's hard to correct for 100 years of RCTs that didn't consider gender, and were mostly male-centric. Never mind a system that churned out mostly male doctors. However, in most Western European countries, we now have a good balance of male/female doctors (trending massively towards more females) and being not believed is much less of an issue. reply throwaway173738 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah I have to go with my wife to doctors visits or they ignore her. All I have to do is sit in the corner and not say anything but my presence is still required for 50% of the doctors she’s seen over the years. reply unsupp0rted 3 hours agorootparentprevI'd like to watch a hidden camera reality show in which people try to convince doctors to take their conditions seriously. Meet Amanda- will she be able to convince Doctor #3 that she's not a secret alcoholic? reply belmarca 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd \"outliers\" aren't necessarily exotic. Idiopathic disease isn't rare and difficult to diagnose. reply colechristensen 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't really think it's about catching outliers. With doctors it's about catching anything that isn't obvious. If you've broken a bone or have a tumor or one of the standard tests comes back out of range, their job is easy. If you haven't they're completely useless and will prescribe either an SSRI or a stimulant. Very many people have very many conditions that aren't trivial to diagnose and just get ignored. It's not because they can't, it's because they're not interested and resources aren't organized enough to be able to give the appropriate amount of attention to a person. reply failrate 5 hours agoparentprevIt took me several years to get a SIBO diagnosis even though the \"breath test\" fir it is cheap and easy. Similar symptoms and treatment to autobrewery syndrome, and a lot of the feedback I got from doctors prior to diagnosis was that I was either a hypochondriac or \"just more sensitive to pain\". reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentI was told that I was a hypochondriac by a few doctors so I went away and studied what hypochondriacs typically complained about. I found that there isn't as much variety in complaints as you would expect if people were independently making things up to complain about and there isn't as much consistency as you would expect if the complaints were due to social contagion. There does seem to be spikes around general awareness like when a popular TikTok or famous person is diagnosed with a thing, but it's possible to use the less well known bucket of comorbidities to figure out what percentage of those are examples of social contagion, what percentage do present with these actual conditions, and what percentages are true hypochondriacs. The first group lack the depth of comorbidities that the second group have, and the true hypochondriacs tend to claim they have absolutely everything no matter how preposterous. From what I found the large majority of those considered hypochondriacs do exhibit the conditions that they believe they have. The social contagion and true hypochondriacs appear to cooccur with mental disorders and are only a small percentage of the cases. I really wish medicine made an effort to distinguish between these three cases to extract the apparent hypochondriacs from the true hypochondriacs and treat them separately. I think a large number of those with undiagnosed conditions actually exhibit conditions from the hEDS bucket of comorbidities which is especially vast and varied. See https://ohtwist.com/about-eds/comorbidities for an incomplete list. This bucket does include SIBO. So if you have been told by a doctor that you're a hypochondriac and you exhibit SIBO these do increase the probability of you having hEDS. There is an assumption that hEDS requires the person to exhibit excess flexibility and while this does appear to be generally true it doesn't appear to be a necessary condition. A person with hEDS, especially if they are male, may not exhibit any excess flexibility but will exhibit hEDS comorbidities at the exactly same rate as someone who has been officially diagnosed with hEDS which would be rather unlikely if they didn't have also have hEDS. Of course if a person exhibits excess flexibility that would increase their likelihood of having hEDS. What is very unorthodox about about my view is that this flexibility is not an essential component so a lack of flexibility is not sufficient to rule it out even if it does reduce the likelihood. reply failrate 4 hours agorootparentThank you for the well considered response, but my symptoms include a tremendous amount of flatulence and diarrhea, a specific smell that other people can detect, etc. that cannot be explained by hypochondria. reply cjbgkagh 4 hours agorootparentI 100% believe that you are not a hypochondriac and did expect you to have corroborating evidence of such. I was writing in criticism your doctor’s initial assessment and of doctors in general. I was also throwing information over a wall on the off chance that the information would be useful to a third party that may not yet know about hEDS and hEDS related comorbidities. reply haldujai 3 hours agorootparentprev> I think a large number of those with undiagnosed conditions actually exhibit conditions from the hEDS bucket of comorbidities which is especially vast and varied. See https://ohtwist.com/about-eds/comorbidities for an incomplete list. This bucket does include SIBO. So if you have been told by a doctor that you're a hypochondriac and you exhibit SIBO these do increase the probability of you having hEDS. Not really. SIBO prevalence increases with age and goes up to 80% in elderly patients. hEDS prevalence is between 0.005% and 0.02%. The symptoms/diseases you listed are very common. We don’t really use hypochondriac anymore but the reason these are common is because they’re vague constitutional symptoms that have 1000 different possible causes or nothing at all. > What is very unorthodox about about my view is that this flexibility is not an essential component so a lack of flexibility is not sufficient to rule it out even if it does reduce the likelihood. There is nothing unorthodox about this, it’s part of the 2017 international criteria for hEDS. https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mal... reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentWell if the actual hEDS prevalence is a lot higher than that then it would upset a lot of your other numbers. The presumed prevalence of hEDS used to be 1/50K, then 1/15K, then 1/5K (you are here) and now more recent research has it 1/500 (post 2019). So I don’t take much stock in presumed prevalence given the history of it. What are the odds that they got it wrong all those other times yet completely right this time. The problem with first presuming this prevalence and then designing diagnostics around it is that of course the measured prevalence using these diagnostics will match the prior assumptions. I’m of the view that it’s ~1/50 (2%) depending on ethnicity and that >90% of these are rather mild and very difficult to detect yet still show up as comorbidities. I currently don’t have the evidence I would like for this theory, I do have enough for my own beliefs. Until I get my hands on enough relevant WGSs I will not have definitive proof. reply Chinjut 5 hours agorootparentprevIt took me nearly two decades of problems before I got a SIBO diagnosis, via breath testing. But now I'm not sure how much stock to put in such tests, given the very recent paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nmo.14817 which suggests positive breath test results may usually be an artifact of decreased transit time more than any small bowel overgrowth. I definitely sympathize with you on doctors generally being unhelpful and uncurious. reply nerdponx 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's ridiculous what doctors will put people through instead of doing a basic test that's cheap and easy to administer and (in the USA) should be covered by health insurance. I know someone who went through a similar experience with H. pylori. reply jrockway 4 hours agorootparentTests are not 100% accurate, so running a test without a good reason can lead to a lot of unnecessary medical intervention. A false positive can lead to thousands of dollars of expense and not getting better. reply solveit 3 hours agorootparentThis reasoning only makes sense in the context of a dysfunctional system. \"We can't gather information because we will react in stupid ways\". Surely the correct response for noninvasive tests is to run the test, and raise the threshold for intervention? reply andrewflnr 2 hours agorootparentOr if it's cheap, run the test twice. And you're presumably going to have other symptoms that corroborate the results. Maybe the symptoms of X are ambiguous alone, but what are the odds you have a positive test for X and matching symptoms but not X itself? Not zero, but lower. reply nradov 1 hour agorootparentRunning most tests twice won't necessarily give you any useful additional information. Tests generally don't give binary results. Like a hydrogen breath test will give a value within a range, but a high value isn't necessarily definitive for diagnosis of SIBO. It's just one piece of evidence. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/12360-hydr... reply failrate 4 hours agorootparentprevIn my particular case, I had numerous other more expensive and invasive tests before my gastro finally decided to even offer the breath test.

The idea that it somehow has opposition from mainstream medicine seems like the kind of thing that an internet community would invent to pretend at being brave rebels (and run defense if case they were caught getting frisky with unsubstantiated health claims.) If you search \"intermittent fasting\" on google, the results are full of very positive articles from all the big names in medicine: Johns Hopkins: Intermittent Fasting: What is it, and how does it work? Mayo Clinic: Intermittent fasting: What are the benefits? Harvard Health: Intermittent fasting: The positive news continues So no, I don't buy for one second that \"most doctors do not believe something like fasting can improve health.\" reply sed3 4 hours agorootparentIntermittent fasting is pretty much American invention with all the usual marketing. reply Cthulhu_ 5 hours agorootparentprevThere's a lot of vagueness in your last statement and I'm not sure what you're trying to imply. \"Most doctors\" is an unspecific appeal to authority; which doctors can you cite that do not believe something like fasting can improve health? \"believe\" was already mentioned by another commenter. An authority will make an assertion based on facts, not a belief based on ??? \"something like\" is it fasting or is it something else? Be specific. \"fasting\" What kind of fasting do you mean? Between sunup and sundown like ramadan? Intermittent fasting? 30 day juice diet fasting? \"improve health\" Improve how? And what aspect of health? \"Health\" is such a broad term that saying \"this is good for your health\" or \"this food is healthy\" are empty statements. reply sed3 4 hours agorootparentMy point is that \"auto brewery syndrome\" is pretty well known at some type of community. reply master-lincoln 5 hours agorootparentprevbecause believing is for religious people... reply sed3 5 hours agorootparentBelieving something with 4000 years of tradition in different cultures, was validated in several studies is \"religious\".

Now that was a resolved case, what about all the other cases? I am living with someone that was told for decades that it was all in their head and that they had psychiatric issues before finally they decided to listen and map the symptoms and realize it was a simpler endocrine problem. This is how patients are treated and especially if they are women and/or racialized. reply thinkingtoilet 2 hours agoparentIt goes both ways. How many alcoholics had this doctor treated that lied about their drinking? We can expect our doctor's to be perfect but addicts lie, and it's normal to expect addicts to lie. I think a little empathy would have gone a long way here, don't get me wrong, but saying they have no humanity is a bit much. reply escape_goat 2 hours agorootparentI do not think it true that it goes \"both ways.\" Patients do not have a collective responsibility to doctors. Patients should not go untreated because other patients lie about their addictions.

There's a fundamental responsibility to perform differential rather than normative diagnosis. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentPatients do not have a collective responsibility to doctors, but I dont think doctors have the responsibility to provide a diagnosis at all.

Reality is messy, and optimal care has a non-zero failure rate. reply ok_dad 1 hour agorootparentMy standard is that doctors listen to patients, which they don’t do because they don’t respect them. They think they’re all knowing, incapable of mistakes, and let their personal biases rule. Every doctor I’ve been to has struggled to listen. Listening is not an impossible standard. reply s1artibartfast 23 minutes agorootparentI have never expereinced a doctor that doesnt listen to their patient. However most dont take everything the patient says at face value. Processing, weighing, and interpreting what patients say is a fundamental part of their job. Sifting through crappy data and figuring out what is relevant. You are paying them for their personal biases. reply ok_dad 18 minutes agorootparent“I haven’t drank alcohol.” The doctors interpretation: “She’s clearly a drunk.” Like I said elsewhere, a night in the hospital would have solved this immediately, but the doctor was unable to get past their own bias. reply nradov 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat standard of care are you proposing? Please be specific. Auto mechanics frequently misdiagnose problems, especially those caused by electrical or software faults. But in the worst case they can usually just keep following the manufacturer's service manual and replacing parts in a trial-and-error process until the vehicle works again. The human body is orders of magnitude more complex and there is no service manual. We have a few evidence-based medicine clinical practice guidelines but those cover only the simplest of cases. For anything more complex, physicians have to fall back on theory, intuition, and experience. It's not surprising that they sometimes get it wrong. And sometimes there's just no way to make a definitive diagnosis for the root cause of a patient's complaints and so treatment is necessarily symptomatic; this can be tough for patients to accept. I'm not trying to defend clinicians who make preventable errors or dismiss legitimate patient concerns but we need to be realistic about what is achievable given the current limited state of medical knowledge. reply ok_dad 1 hour agorootparentThe standard here was the doctor didn’t listen to the woman. He could easily have found she was lying or not with a simple overnight visit to the hospital. Put her in there for one night, see she’s not drinking but still drunk, and that’s it. Instead, she suffered for ages. Listening is a simple standard. Doctors don’t listen because they don’t care further than getting more patients through the door faster. If I tell my mechanic there is a problem with the steering, he’s not going to change the oil and send my car out, he’ll check the fucking steering. reply s1artibartfast 19 minutes agorootparentDid the woman come in and say \"I have auto-brewery syndrome, and I want you to test me for it\"? If so, then the comparison is off. It isnt that the doctors \"didn't listen\", it is that they didn't correctly deduce a 1 in a million cause, based on the information they had. reply ok_dad 15 minutes agorootparentShe came in, the doctor asked if she had drunk alcohol, she says no, what more is there to understand? This doctor didn’t listen. If he had, even if he didn’t know about this specific disease, he could have started tests and brought in other doctors. Instead, suffering. Not hard to understand. Doctors don’t listen. s1artibartfast 2 hours agoparentprevI think there is a major disconnect between the public expectation for doctors, and what their role actually is. It is more accurate to think of a doctors as job as offering aid to resolve a problem if they can, and not ensuring a particular outcome.

It is probably more common than diagnosed, but still incredibly rare! reply jxramos 2 hours agoprev> with a strategy of antifungal therapy and a low-carbohydrate diet.

I think the last 3/4 times I've been prescribed antibiotics (different doctors, different states) I was given a speech and take home sheet about needing to take probiotics with them. The 4th just gave the sheet and skipped most all the talking in general. No prescription for it on any count but that's no different than being told to take any standard dosage of an OTC (in lieu of making you feel better about going if nothing else was prescribed already that visit). I think it also depends on the antibiotic how much you get recommended a probiotic. There was one I was given for a stubborn tooth infection and the endodontist was militantly clear that I needed to take a probiotic and spent about 5 minutes going over the signs of cdiff as it was a common result and can be so problematic. Still ended up getting cdiff anyways but at least I knew what to expect :). reply nerdponx 52 minutes agorootparentIt really sucks that you ended up with c. diff even with the probiotics. But it's a relief that the doctors seem to care. Here in the northeast at best they offhandedly suggest trying a probiotic, but give no advice beyond that. If you mention probiotic foods you get a shrug and a \"sure that's good\", but they never volunteer it. reply belorn 4 hours agorootparentprevThe metabolic system is like a ecosystem, where every intervention has a fairly large spectrum of unknowns. Probiotics can do harm, just like antibiotics, or it may do nothing, or it may improve health or reduce symptoms. Generally it doesn't have long term negative effect so it fairly safe, but I can see how doctors would be careful throwing in additional unknowns, especially initially when testing if the antibiotics themselves has the intended effect without major side effects. We live in symbiosis with the gut flora, and the tools we have to fix problems are crude and based on trial and error. reply nerdponx 55 minutes agorootparentThat is true of literally anything ever. It's becoming clear that the risks of probiotic supplementation to counteract the damage caused by antibiotics are substantially lower than the benefit of actually counteracting the damage caused by antibiotics. Yes, you can get cramps or diarrhea or brain fog or even SIBO, but that all sounds a lot better to me than intractable c-diff or the growing number of \"peripheral\" health problems that we now know are at least somewhat related to gut health. reply AuryGlenz 4 hours agorootparentprevProbiotics are really limited in scope compared to what bacteria you naturally have, unfortunately. They’re far from a silver bullet. That’s why things like fecal transplants exist. reply nerdponx 57 minutes agorootparentYeah but obliterating your gut flora without even making an attempt at remediation is madness to me. It's like saying that people who quit smoking shouldn't bother going to the gym because their lungs are already busted. I haven't looked at the literature in a while, but several years ago I saw some research which concluded that probiotics generally do not directly recolonize the gut; instead, they temporarily prevent colonization by \"bad\" things and help maintain a healthy environment until diverse recolonization happens gradually over time. I also saw some evidence (backed by personal experience) that \"complex\" naturally fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, etc) were more effective than single-culture probiotics. reply jakubmazanec 4 hours agorootparentprevIt probably depends on a country or a doctor. Here in Czechia I never got prescription for antibiotics without both doctor and pharmacist advising me to also take probiotics. reply simiones 4 hours agorootparentprevI was prescribed probiotics every time I was prescribed an antibiotic in the last few years, even by a dentist. This may vary a lot by country, though. reply metadaemon 5 hours agorootparentprevA very notorious antibiotic for its plethora of side-effects. reply im3w1l 6 hours agoparentprevThe article seems to hint at her previous gut flora being wiped out by broad-spectrum anti-biotics taken for her recurrent urinary tract infections, thus allowing the fungi in. reply jMyles 6 hours agoparentprevSecond and third paragraphs under \"discussion\": > Auto-brewery syndrome is thought to result when microorganisms capable of fermenting alcohol from carbohydrates outgrow normal gut flora.6 Although population-based studies have shown that gut alcohol fermentation with low levels of endogenous ethanol can occur even among healthy people, blood ethanol levels rarely reach concentrations high enough to cause intoxication.7 Auto-brewery syndrome is uncommon because it requires several host factors to interact with substantial overpopulation of fermenting microorganisms, and high carbohydrate consumption.6 Comorbidities such as diabetes, liver disease, gut dysmotility disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease are associated with auto-brewery syndrome through mechanisms contributing to increased levels of blood glucose and decreased ethanol metabolism.6,7 Genetic predisposition for inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme and subsequent inefficient alcohol metabolism, may also play a role.6 In our patient, we suspect her recurrent antibiotics for UTI and dexlansoprazole use led to gut dysbiosis with potential contribution of genetics, resulting in auto-brewery syndrome. > Commonly implicated fungi responsible for outgrowing normal gut flora in auto-brewery syndrome are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida species including C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata.2 Bacteria have also been cultured from patients with auto-brewery syndrome. Although the role of bacteria remains unclear, a recent case–control study proposed Klebsiella pneumoniae as an important culprit.7–9 reply im3w1l 5 hours agoprevI'm a little surprised there is no mention of flatulence in that article. The reddit post in aaron695's comment does bring it up, and intuitively I think it should be present. I self-diagnosed (so yeah make of it what you will) auto-brewery syndrome in myself, after I had ingested unusually large amounts of live yeast - I had been making cider and drinking it a bit earlier then recommended - while the yeast was still very active, as I was playing around. Only symptom I noticed was flatulence after carb-heavy meals (didn't notice becoming tipsy, but I'm not very good at noticing that either ig). Like I literally farted once a minute for a day one time. However this only lasted a very short time, maybe a few days. I still had a very mild version of that like a month or two later (from memory so idk) and like a year or two later it was completely gone. reply steezeburger 5 hours agoparentHow can you self diagnose yourself from a symptom that's not even included as a symptom for what you're self diagnosing for? reply im3w1l 5 hours agorootparentWell I didn't think of it in terms of the label auto-brewery syndrome. Rather I was just thinking \"I guess the yeast has colonized my gut\". How, well because I have seen and listened to fermentation and admired the bubbling process - it's very satisfying btw. And so it seemed very natural to assume that the same thing was happening inside me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV_9tfFyY00 reply MisterTea 4 hours agoparentprevBrooklyn Lager + 24 month aged Canadian cheddar + rosemary & olive oil Triscuits = flatulence so bad it will keep you awake or you will fart yourself awake multiple times.
