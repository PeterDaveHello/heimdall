    "originBody": "Tales from Kagi Home Blog Unlimited Kagi searches for $10 per month 21 Sep, 2023 This year has been extraordinary for Kagi. We had tremendous support from our customers, and we want to start this by taking a moment to say thank you. We really appreciate it. Since we launched Kagi, our users have raved about the search quality, but many have stressed about the cost of search and having to change their search habits when switching from an ad-supported service, so we’re fixing that. We’re thrilled to announce that unlimited search is now included in our $10/month Professional plan and our Ultimate, Family, and Duo plans. “When I first heard of Kagi (and saw the prices) I thought: this is the stupidest thing ever, jesus it’s priced for Silicon Valley bros. Well, I just turned on yearly payments seconds ago… I guess it’s just that good?” Kagi Discord user, a couple of weeks ago - good news for this member :) When we first adjusted our pricing, the search landscape was undergoing seismic shifts and brimming with uncertainty. The world watched as the emergence of powerful AI began rewriting the rules of search, and giants in the tech industry started a battle for dominance. It was a time of challenges and tough decisions for a small bootstrapped company like ours. We were determined to ensure Kagi was still around next year and remains a constant, reliable companion for your search needs. Today, the tides are changing. With new search sources proving more cost-efficient, the improved efficiency of our infrastructure, and the broader market embracing Kagi, we can again offer an unlimited experience to a broader group of users. We’re excited that this change will let many more people enjoy a fun, ad-free, and user-centric web search. Here is how the changes look through our membership plans. Professional Plan Kagi has one goal - creating the most delightful search experience for our members. Starting today, enjoy unlimited searches with Kagi. For a mere $10/mo, step into the expansive world of Kagi’s renowned search quality and rich features, all crafted with you in mind. Oh, and by the way, this also includes unlimited use of our Universal Summarizer, which can summarize unlimited-length documents, audio, and video! As a part of this update, we are also introducing the annual payment option with 10% off! “For me Kagi represents an incredible accomplishment: the first search engine that gives better results than Google, respects privacy, offers customization and so much more. Thank you.” No, thank you, for supporting us! Starter Plan (formerly called Standard) This plan continues as our special introductory offer, designed for those ready to step beyond the free trial but still exploring whether the Professional plan aligns with their needs or fall into the category of most internet users who search just a few times a day on average. We are removing the pay-per-use component (to simplify our billing infrastructure) and making it simple: 300 searches for $5/month. If a user hits this cap consistently, we recommend upgrading to unlimited searches at $10/month. This change also allows us to add the annual payment option at 10% off, which many of you requested. “3 months in - I find myself annoyed when I’m on a device that isn’t mine and I have to use google.” Same here, same here Ultimate Plan We’re aware that many of you used the Ultimate Plan for its access to unlimited searches. Starting today, we will be giving Ultimate Plan users access to the closed beta of the next generation of tools that Kagi is bringing to the web, and we’re targeting access for all our current Ultimate users in the next few days. While we can not reveal yet what that is in detail as we’re still iterating quickly, no competitor comes close to the value proposition of this new feature suite. We would like you to help us better shape their future and join the fun! When we release these new tools publicly, Ultimate users will have exclusive use of their most advanced features - ensuring your Kagi experience remains top of the line. The Ultimate plan is also still the best way to support Kagi on its mission to humanize the web, and we are incredibly grateful to all of you who have chosen to do so. “The belief the search was better because they have so much history of me and such a strong ML team is why I kept using Google Search despite trying to get away from other Google products. Kagi lenses really do show how much it’s not true, and how much Google’s collection of my data isn’t actually returning on my data and privacy investment.” Turns out people know what they want better than algorithms do New Kagi Search Individual plans Family & Duo Plans Family moments are precious, and we’re here to enrich them. Now, the whole family can explore a world of information together, with unlimited searches for $20/month (Family, up to six members) and $14/mo (Duo, for a couple). We are inching closer to our vision where families can trust their search engine to prioritize their well-being over third parties and advertisers and where young minds grow uninfluenced by the data-hungry algorithms profiling them and changing their behavior. Discover the joy of safe and ad-free search, nurturing curiosity without compromise. Learn more about the values that shape the Kagi Family plan. “This sort of stuff makes me really happy to be a Kagi subscriber. Not only do I get value out of Kagi, but it shows me that the money is being used to develop Kagi in a way I agree with. By comparison, REDACTED (just picking one of my subs) feels hostile to me. I pay them, but I would cancel in a heartbeat if I felt I had options. I really appreciate Kagi’s development matching what i feel like i’m buying. Thanks Kagi Team ” Awww, thank you! We'll keep on putting your money to good use New Kagi Search Family plans Frequently Asked Questions Q. How do I sign up? A. Click here to become a member. Q. Do I need to do anything to get the benefits of the new plans? A. All changes will be automatic and applied to your account today. Q. I do not have a credit card. Can I also pay for Kagi with PayPal or crypto? A. Yes. We have recently added new payment options to allow payment through credit card, PayPal, and Bitcoin/Lightning through OpenNode. Q. Now that I don’t have to count my searches, how can I switch all my browsers and devices to Kagi? A. We have several options available. See here for more details. Q. I have an outstanding pay-per-use balance on my current Standard or Professional plan. What happens now? A. Effective today, we are waiving all pending metered usage charges for you. Yahoo! Q. I noticed that the Ultimate plan changed to 10% off for annual payments. I previously had 15% off. Do I remain locked in? A. Yes, as long as you do not cancel, you will have the previous discount applied to your renewals. Q. When do I get the new advanced features of the Ultimate plan? A. We are starting to roll out access today in batches, and we expect to onboard all Ultimate plan users to new features by the end of the next week. Q. How can I get the new Ultimate plan level features in the Family plan? A. We haven’t established a mechanism to incorporate Ultimate plan features into the Family plan yet. However, we are open to suggestions and would appreciate any ideas you may have. Please share your thoughts at KagiFeedback.org. Q. Do I need to do anything with my grandfathered Early-adopter/Legacy Professional plan? A. We will be simplifying this over the next few days in the UI, as this is all the same Professional plan now from a perspective of functionality. If you recently renewed with Legacy Professional Annual and want to take advantage of the new 10% off, you can cancel and renew to take advantage of the discount. You may will be left with some pro-rated credits in your Stripe account which will be used for future renewals. If you have the Early-Adopter flag, you will still keep it - we just didn’t have anything to tie it to right now, which does not mean we won’t in the future. Q. I’m keen to support Kagi but concerned about its longevity, given the history of search startups. How can I be assured Kagi is here to stay? A. What sets Kagi apart from other search engines is our fundamentally different, user-centric approach that prioritizes the interests of our members and the alignment of incentives. It’s worth noting that Kagi’s growth has been purely organic, without any expenditure on marketing or customer acquisition, attesting to the inherent value and trust our user base places in us and the growing need for better search. We have priced our offering so that we do not rely financially on VC funding, data sales, or anything but our users’ contributions. We have had requests from our users to invest in Kagi, and we’re happy to offer that way to support us (see below). We are striving to build a sustainable business, and we invite you to review our live stats for a transparent view of our steady progress. Your support matters, and we appreciate it a lot. Q. How can I deepen my involvement with Kagi’s journey? A. We are thrilled to hear of your interest! Kagi is very open to collaboration, and we like to say that 50% of our product has been built by its members. We have a variety of ways you can get involved and contribute. We are also open to applications for positions at Kagi. If you’re already a Kagi user and are interested in becoming a shareholder, we’re considering another fundraiser early next year. Please get in touch, and we will let you know once we are ready.

Kagi is by far the best search engine there is.When I first started using Kagi a year ago or so, I compared results with Google every now and then.Now? Never.10 bucks a month for a tool that I use multiple times every single day is more than reasonable. The results hit home virtually every time.There are variety of features to customize your searches but truthfully, I never found the need for them. I&#x27;ve only blocked&#x2F;deprioritized some domains, that&#x27;s it. The results are just so good. reply antihero 26 minutes agoparentI am giving it another shot. First thing I&#x27;ve noticed is the lack of localisation with results.If I search for \"Elac 6.2 speakers amazon\" it comes up with a .com link. I have to search for \"Elac 6.2 speakers amazon uk\" for it to go to .co.uk.This was an option with Google that I liked.*Weirdly now if I search for \"elac debut 6.2 amazon\" it comes up with a UK link :S reply jjar 13 minutes agorootparentThere&#x27;s a dropdown at the top for the locale - you can select UK and you should get UK results. reply mongol 13 hours agoparentprevCan the search result quality be quantified somehow? I remember when Google was new, and I used to use Altavista and Hotbot and those older search engines, the difference in results were like night and day, and Google&#x27;s results were \"wow!\"Does Kagi give a similar impression as Google did then? reply viraptor 12 hours agorootparentIn my experience it&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s better quality results found, but rather low quality results are skipped. There&#x27;s a lot filtered by default + it&#x27;s easy to click \"block this domain\" when you run into yet another stackoverflow copy. It means that when you&#x27;re searching for code related things, you often get small relevant blogs in position 3+ rather than SEO spam.For example searching for \"current time on JavaScript\" on Google, I get SO, MDN, and basically a lot of SEO spam sites. Same thing on Kagi https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com&#x2F;search?q=current+time+in+JavaScript&r=au&sh... ends with an actually interesting blog on position 5, link to moment.js on GH, further down posts about accuracy and about the Temporal API proposal, etc. reply bambax 3 hours agorootparent> when you run into yet another stackoverflow copyOMG. Why doesn&#x27;t Google filter out the likes of geeksforgeeks for instance? How is it possible that it always come before the genuine SO answer?Even without offering the possibility to filter out a domain (which they had, and later removed), how does the ranking algorithm not see those horrible, zero value clones?? reply popcorncowboy 26 minutes agorootparentThese sites exist precisely _because_ of their expertise in the toxic race-to-the-bottom SEO&#x2F;SEM game that Google created. reply oblio 2 hours agorootparentprevMisaligned incentives (in corporate terms, $$$).I can&#x27;t tell you what they are, but there are probably internal Google incentives to filter and internal Google incentives to not filter, and the ones to not filter are probably stronger. reply willvarfar 1 hour agorootparentMy theory is that google went from ads in search results to ads on visited pages. By buying doubleclick etc they are suddenly incentivised to drive traffic to ad-supported websites.Almost all the interesting factual websites are not ad-monetized. The SO spam etc are all scraps of the factual websites with ads injected. If google simply deprioritized ad-supported websites the search results would be much cleaner, but the part of google that sells the ads on sites instead of in search results would throw a fit. reply flir 6 minutes agorootparentWe could test this. Take a few hundred search queries, strip the pages that display Google ads, and see if the remainder of the search result is better or worse.Probably need to get some humans in to rank the results, but that&#x27;s not a big problem. \"How well does this web page answer this query, on a scale of 1-10?\"Worth bearing in mind that the stackoverflow clones may actually answer the query just as well as the original site - that is, it might be our definition of a \"good result\" that&#x27;s out of whack, not Google&#x27;s results. (I doubt this, but again it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s testable). Phemist 54 minutes agorootparentprevAha. This makes a lot of sense for Google.But the same websites show up in e.g. DDG (through Bing), as far as I know neither DDG nor Microsoft make a dime from ad-supported websites like Google would, why are these results not nuked similarly to what Kagi is doing? reply Phemist 37 minutes agorootparentAha. Couldn&#x27;t help but scratch my own itch. I wonder if DDG has a deal with Google where they get a cut of the ad profit if they are mentioned as a `ref` in the doubleclick ad request.:path: &#x2F;pagead&#x2F;viewthroughconversion&#x2F;796001856&#x2F;?random=1695374589838&cv=11&fst=1695374589838&bg=ffffff&guid=ON&async=1&gtm=45be39k0&u_w=2704&u_h=1756&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geeksforgeeks.org%2Fc-plus-plus%2F &ref=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F.it&#x27;s easy to click \"block this domain\"Friendly reminder that google had this feature a decade ago then removed it. Hopefully someone in the C-Suite got a few back pats for that decision.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchengineland.com&#x2F;google-brings-back-blocking-sit... reply RajT88 6 hours agorootparentGoogle&#x27;s gotta make money off Pinterest somehow, based on the most blocked domains on Kagi:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com&#x2F;statsPinterest is a scourge on the modern web, worse than any other. reply ask_b123 5 hours agorootparentMight these stats be biased by the demographics that use Kagi? I don&#x27;t use Pinterest, and never really encounter it on a daily basis, but some of my friends really like the site. Tbf, they might use stackoverflow more, but seeing Hacker News on the top 5 doesn&#x27;t seem to reflect the average web user&#x27;s usage... reply hnben 27 minutes agorootparent> Might these stats be biased by the demographics that use Kagi?yes, obviously.but also: Selection Bias Is A Fact Of Lifehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.astralcodexten.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;selection-bias-is-a-fact-of... reply climb_stealth 5 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if it is also biased in the sense that it&#x27;s only certain people who customise these things. And that it&#x27;s only the most common ones. You would never see my favourite car forum listed here, but bumping it in search results is where I see value with the feature. reply tayo42 3 hours agorootparentprevThere was a time where Google image search was dominated by Pinterest results but clinking through never took you to the photo. And most of the photos were rehosting of the original so you wouldn&#x27;t get that either. reply popcorncowboy 22 minutes agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s telling that the top sites on that list accurately map to companies that have been the most \"successful\" at blitzing the incentive structures of the current internet economics model. reply lostlogin 30 minutes agorootparentprevI’d argue that Google is worse than Pinterest. We got here due to Google. reply CynicusRex 4 hours agorootparentprevIt is indeed, hence “https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startpage.com&#x2F;do&#x2F;search?q=%s -site:quora.com -site:pinterest.com” as my default search syntax. reply permo-w 3 hours agorootparentI have a strong memory that Quora used to be quite good, and then was suddenly horrendous. Is this just me? reply ConSeannery 1 hour agorootparentNot just you, it used to have solely high quality Q&A...then the yahoo answers folks migrated over reply laserlight 3 hours agorootparentprevI had to quit doing so, because I discovered that it didn&#x27;t just exclude listed domains, but performed a totally different search. Locations or local results were largely missing, when I excluded some domains. reply mrAssHat 1 hour agorootparentThat&#x27;s curious, please expand on this. Do you really mean it performed a search for different thing? If so - have you figured how it differed?Or did it just have to perform a non-cached search and thus not only excluded said domains, but could also reorder the other results based on the current relevance, rather than cached relevance from the past that is being served to everyone else who doesn&#x27;t exclude said domains? reply biglyburrito 5 hours agorootparentprevThe uBlacklist browser plugin adds support for blocking sites in Google searches.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iorate.github.io&#x2F;ublacklist&#x2F;docs reply Gustomaximus 6 hours agorootparentprevThis seems the most obvious value add feature for search results at both an individual level and for reviewing overall moderation.I wonder what possible logic there could be to not allow it? The only one I can think of is they don&#x27;t want bridgading to create a wider system block but that seems easily enough to resolve. reply beefield 5 hours agorootparentThe easiest is to look where the money is. Might be risky to let your custo^H products hide the pages where you have most revenue generating ads. reply zo1 1 hour agorootparentprevEventually someone was going to create an easy to list&#x2F;share&#x2F;subscribe list that individuals could easily add to their personal Google domain block list. Think EasyList.At that point they would be bleeding ad revenue as all the nasty, fake, abusive, spammy websites would be insta blocked.Imagine being able to add a list and all of a sudden half the SEO blogs are excluded from results. Assuming Google even allows it, they would then have to work even harder to find relevant content to your search query. They can&#x27;t rely on throwing a huge wall of semi-relevant results that you have to wade through, generating ad impressions as you go along. reply JoshuaEN 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is my experience as well. Low quality junk is often not present, and if it does show up, it&#x27;s two mouse clicks to never see that domain again.Also the ability to promote high quality domains helps even more with this (though i have found one needs to be careful with pinning domains, as it can lead to irrelevant results being shown first because they have some if the same keywords). reply ipaddr 4 hours agorootparentFeels like I&#x27;m paying to do someone elses job. reply stavros 3 hours agorootparentWell, your alternative is that the job doesn&#x27;t get done, for free. reply kelnos 10 hours agorootparentprev> yet another stackoverflow copyI never got why these even ever appear in Google search results (or any search results, really). It feels like it would be super trivial to identify sites that are scraped copies of other sites. Granted, without foreknowledge, the engine doesn&#x27;t know which is the original. But at the very least this can be determined by a human once, and then the problem goes away forever for that particular site. reply cryptonym 1 hour agorootparentMaybe that scraped copy leverages doubleclick so its success is aligned with Google interests, sometimes even more than the original website. reply tiagod 9 hours agorootparentprevThat ship has already sailed, they are already using AI in mass to generate original looking content. reply BizarreByte 8 hours agorootparentAt this point it&#x27;s just safer to treat any content newer than about a year ago as highly suspect. Bots and fake content have been around for years, but things changed when ChatGPT and the copycats went live. reply waynesonfire 9 hours agorootparentprevit&#x27;s kind of upsetting that the first to benefit from LLMs are the scum of the internet. reply boxed 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s googles fault. They are the ones who make this a viable business model. They pay the ads, and they pollute their search results with this garbage.100% Google who are destroying this part of the internet. reply mensetmanusman 6 hours agorootparentprevThe love of money reply HideousKojima 3 hours agorootparentprevTrying to find any guides for anything in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 returns page upon page of AI generated garbage, a sure sign of things to come. reply retsibsi 4 hours agorootparentprevIs this after you&#x27;ve done a lot of blocking (or other customisation)? For me the top Kagi results are mostly similar to the Google ones, and when I scroll down a bit Kagi doesn&#x27;t save me from articles with openings like> Time is an important part of our life and we cannot avoid it. In our daily routine, we need to know the current date or time frequently.and> Time, a measure of the passing of moments. reply viraptor 4 hours agorootparentNot too much. I&#x27;ve got maybe 5 straight up SO clones blocked, but that&#x27;s about it. reply dbish 4 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s still an example of better quality results that should be quantifiable, that&#x27;s ranking. We have things like precision@n&#x2F;NDCG@n&#x2F;etc. where it should be straight forward to show a metric for some smaller n where Kagi beats Google since it doesn&#x27;t show some set of irrelebant&#x2F;low quality results interspersed. reply eviks 3 hours agorootparentprevBut with an extension I can have a personal garbage block list or hide&#x2F;collapse website preview without removing the result completely that works on other search enginesBtw, can you hide text preview on Kagi instead of removing the domain completely (in case you&#x27;re not certain the website is garbage and sometimes want to check the results, but just want them less visible)? reply alberth 5 hours agorootparentprev> “searching … on Google, I get SO, MDM and basically a lot of SEO spam sites”I get the same in Kagi clicking your link above.Both the 1st and 3rd result is SO. 2nd result is MDM.I’m confused, so what’s different between paid Kagi and free Google search then?(Note: I’m not hating on Kagi, I’m just genuinely wanting to understand) reply pasc1878 2 hours agorootparentSO, MDM are the good results together with the blog Kagi gave in 5th place. In google you got the first two then a lot of spam and not the other good results. reply FpUser 9 hours agorootparentprevI just did exactly this search on Google. The first result was this -[0] which is exactly spot on. Not sure if it is because I use Brave browser which also blocks ads on websites.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tecadmin.net&#x2F;get-current-date-time-javascript&#x2F;#:~:te... reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentThe result on Google is indeed correct, but I was posting a trivial example that was supposed to show the variety of answers&#x2F;sources not the accuracy of the top one. For that, they&#x27;re fairly similar, although Kagi seems to prefer the higher signal-to-crap ratio. reply MatthiasPortzel 8 hours agorootparentprevYou clearly use an ad blocker. That page is over 50% ads. reply Falkon1313 5 hours agorootparentWow. I just loaded it and then turned off the adblocker and reloaded it. It&#x27;s like you need another search engine just to find the content in the page hidden amongst all those ads.I can&#x27;t believe some people actually use the internet like that all the time. reply dgb23 3 hours agorootparentYes people are. And it’s the least technically literate people with “outdated” machines and bad connections that slug through the web like this. They don’t know what to trust and often fall prey to deceptive tactics. reply fauigerzigerk 3 hours agorootparentprevStrange, I don&#x27;t see a single ad for this query (current time in javascript), using Chrome logged into my Google account. Results are good as well. reply FpUser 8 hours agorootparentprevWell I did not see any thanks to Brave and the content was spot on and that is all that really matters to me reply darkwater 6 minutes agorootparentAnd by that, you are telling google you liked that result (by clicking on it), even if in the end ads revenue is not increased by your visit. Maybe Google consider less important signals coming from ad-blocking browsers, that I don&#x27;t know. spencerchubb 7 hours agorootparentprevMy goodness, I thought you were exaggerating. I&#x27;ve been using ad blockers for so long, I forgot the web had this many ads. Or has it just gotten worse over time? reply donny2018 2 hours agorootparentWell, I still remember times when 50% of google results weren’t ads.Interestingly, Bing almost doesn’t display search ads, and the search results are becoming even better than Google. I haven’t had a need to use google for a few months now. reply retsibsi 4 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if adblockers have contributed to this. In theory we users can reward non-horrible advertisers by whitelisting their ads, but in practice we tend to block as much as possible. The remaining ad-viewing audience will be partly composed of people who are ethically opposed to adblocking or are held back by a lack of tech knowledge, but it will also be relatively insensitive to ads (both in the sense of being able to put up with a lot, and in the sense of requiring a lot to attract their attention). reply pbhjpbhj 2 hours agorootparentIf Chrome, Edge, Safari all came with uBlock by default, what percentage do you think would be \"ethically opposed\" enough to disable the extension? How many would turn it right back on? reply allarm 2 hours agorootparentprev> ethically opposed to adblockingHow can you be ethically opposed to something that ruins your experience? It’s obviously their choice, I just can’t imaging browsing without adblock, I’m ethically opposed to the pages filled with crap I guess. reply bluGill 27 minutes agorootparentThose who go through the effort to make good web content, and who pay the costs for a web server deserve to be paid. So ethically I should not block ads.I block them anyway because ads also have an ethical contract with me that they have broken. They need to not take up too many resources on my computer, not make noise when the website otherwise has no noise content, not install malware, and be for legitimate products not scams. Probably more as well, but the above are things I regularly caught ads doing before I got an ad blocker. reply abustamam 7 hours agorootparentprevI think it depends on the site. I remember early 00s where many download sites would have ads with a download button, or pop-ups that blasted sound like YOU JUST WON. Now I think that sorta thing has been normalized to even non shady sites. My primary use of ad blocker is so that I don&#x27;t get random autoplaying videos. reply tacitusarc 7 hours agorootparentprevIt has gotten significantly worse. replyvachina 3 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that Kagi has a blocklist tells me their algo isn’t any superior.The best kind of search engine is the kind that can read your mind (by inferring your intention or something) reply pbhjpbhj 2 hours agorootparentMaybe for you that is better, but I want word negation to work, and \"verbose\" to actually require words I specify to be on the page. Word stemming would be good as an option.Sure, I&#x27;d like Booleans to work again, and intitle:.That said, Google could probably make an inferred search interpretation work well if they wanted to return results that were good for the user rather than return results that optimise their ad revenue. reply efdee 3 hours agorootparentprevI feel that Google&#x27;s going downhill ever since they started to try reading my mind. reply eitland 4 hours agorootparentprevYes.In four ways for me:- it actually respects my search. If I search for \"\" I get no result. It doesn&#x27;t silently twist my search until it gets something it can show me a million utterly irrelevant results for. This is a huge time saver for me.- there are no ads. I usually didn&#x27;t notice ads in the search results anyway as they were always irrelevant, but recently there has been so many of them that it took away space from the search results. Going back now feels weird.- as others have already mentioned a lot of low quality pages just doesn&#x27;t show up, leaving room for other, more relevant and&#x2F;or high quality pages.- built in tooling to deal with pages I don&#x27;t care about and that Kagi hasn&#x27;t already dealt with. reply eviks 3 hours agorootparentDoes it warn you about typos in your \"prhase that exists with a phrase \" or just blanks out? reply _flux 43 minutes agorootparentIf you get zero results, you&#x27;d probably see the mistake prettty fast, right?I imagine most often (like 90%+ of cases) when one searches for phrases they would be a result of copy-pasting from another source, so handling this case in a special way would just not be worth the effort. reply benhurmarcel 3 hours agorootparentprevIt does fix typos unless you put them in quotes. And tells you about it. reply eviks 2 hours agorootparentI was specifically asking about typos in quotes reply adamsb6 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m just a week into using it, but one of the things I&#x27;ve noticed is that for technical queries official docs are ranked a lot higher than random blogs and those sites that just repackage content they scraped from Stack Overflow.I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re putting a finger on the scale, or maybe they&#x27;re just doing the original Google thing of ranking sites that seem to be where the search terminates higher, but it&#x27;s good. reply olig15 10 hours agorootparentYou can bump individual sites up and down in priority for your account. Hover over the shield to the right of each result and click ‘raise’, ‘lower’ etc reply 14 9 hours agorootparentIt appears you can as one commenter who uses the search engine states in one of the comments. reply svaha1728 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you evaluate Kagi make sure to play around with the \"Personalized Results\" settings.

Maybe it&#x27;s because we have really good ad-blockers running, but their content seems fine and (generally?) not terribly \"lifted\" from other sites (I.E., just SEO spam).Is there a replacement for them that fills the same gap for web reference &#x2F; tutorials? reply belltaco 11 hours agorootparentI think people have been using MDN.This has some of the context https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110412103745&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3fools.co...But looks like w3schools has cleaned up their act in the past decade. reply wyclif 7 hours agorootparentThey have. It&#x27;s a lot better now than when they started out. They have incrementally been improving it. The reason why it gets pushed down is because a lot of people have a natural distate for the ads and the fact that it&#x27;s a content farm. But if you have good ad blocking I don&#x27;t see the harm in using it as long as you understand what it is. reply jacurtis 7 hours agorootparentI think its the same as it has always been.They went from being bad compared to everything else to now feeling good compared to everything else.Basically they stayed static and the rest of the internet worsened around them and our perspectives are now skewed.What used to feel like a spammy content farm is actually not that bad now that we have seen real spammy content farms, like the SO clones that just take SO posts, rip out important css elements so it is harder to read, and slap as many ads as the ad networks allow them around it and then throw up exit intent banners and crypto-mining javascript.Now just a normal content farm feels like a breath of fresh air when we deal with those garbage sites as alternatives. reply wyclif 7 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you about w3schools; they&#x27;ve improved a lot since they first started out, and cleaned up a lot of problems. I think it&#x27;s just fine to use for that purpose.

I don&#x27;t gamble because I expect to win money; I gamble because the experience (especially with more social games like craps) is fun to me, even when I lose. Certainly it&#x27;s not fun to everyone, but roller coasters aren&#x27;t fun to everyone either, and that&#x27;s fine.If you only gamble or play the lottery because you genuinely think you have a reasonable shot of coming out ahead (vs. other uses for that money), then you may have a problem. Or if you have an addiction to gambling and it&#x27;s actually hurting your finances.The other bit is that if you&#x27;re poor, and playing the lottery is a way for you to build a little hope into your life (even if, deep down, you know you&#x27;re unlikely to win), that&#x27;s... questionable, maybe? Not an indictment of yourself, but it calls into question societal structures that essentially profit off your low-level financial despair, in return for lessening that despair a little, but only with a placebo. When instead society should instead be helping you, to, y&#x27;know, not be poor.But hey, if someone allocates $5 in their budget to buy scratch-offs every day, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s probably better for their health than eating a $5 ice cream sundae every day. reply pbhjpbhj 2 hours agorootparentThe poor people who buy a $5 ice-cream sundae every day are the ones addicted to food ... people are not making a freely reasoned choice to spend money gambling, poor people are in a vulnerable position and lottery runners exploit that with heavy advertising to ensure people are hooked on the idea they can improve things by spending money on what seems like hope. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentprevLook at the numbers of the people playing lotto&#x2F;scratch-offs.

But if, rather than expected value, you are optimizing for “probability of having a hundred million dollars” or whatever, your options are: keep the money you would have spent on the ticket (0% chance of success) or buy the ticket (very small chance of success).So, I can see why people go for it. Especially if the ticket cost won’t make an actual difference to their life circumstances, and the winning money would. reply yunwal 5 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s still probably better to throw all the money down on an unlikely sports bet or some crazy options trade. The lottery is particularly skewed to the house. reply bluGill 10 minutes agorootparentAt least with sports betting skill can make money. Just betting on the first place team to win over the last place team for example, it won&#x27;t always win, but typically will. Of course bookies know this and so the payoff isn&#x27;t enough to make a living on (if you can figure out the exception and bet only on the last place teams that win you can live well). Statistics are generally well studied in sports, but if you study how a team is coached you can find cases where they have a better than statistical chance to win a game they are expected to lose. Most people betting sports either always bet for their team, or bet on statistics, so if you can exploit something else. dazc 4 hours agorootparentprevI can see a potential problem here in that a sizeable win from a random bet is likely to encourage some people to keep making these bets in future, with inevitable consequences. reply Falkon1313 5 hours agorootparentprev$2 isn&#x27;t going to get much from an options trade, or a sports bet either. reply audiodude 6 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t love the lottery or scratch offs, though I don&#x27;t mind playing occasionally.But what I can&#x27;t stand is the self perceived moral superiority of people who are like \"haha, lottery is for idiots!\" reply dazc 4 hours agorootparentprevPeople still win the lottery though, bad math skills or not. reply meroes 10 hours agorootparentprevEven those who don’t think ads affect them are mistaken. And if you extirpate ads completely from your life the tax is your time and effort to do so. That’s one of the most toxic mantras, it even seems purposefully misguiding. reply gaudystead 7 hours agorootparentI mostly agree, but I&#x27;ve been blocking ads however ways I can for years now, and I&#x27;d say a few minutes of setup has saved me HOURS of dealing with ads at this point.Plus... Building a PiHole was downright fun and easy. reply Falkon1313 5 hours agorootparentI wish I&#x27;d been able to get the pihole to work as easily as it sounded. It looked cool. But it was incompatible with the router from the ISP I had at the time, and rather than also buy and setup a new router, I just packed it away. Now I have a new ISP with a different router, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s incompatible too.But at least it only takes 30 seconds to install ublock origin, and no extra hardware. reply Silasdev 1 hour agorootparentYou should really consider getting a proper router like Unifi or the like. It&#x27;s a one time cost and it will save you from these issues no matter what ISP supplied crap you end up getting.Just plug whatever ISP router directly into your own, more capable, router and your home network will look identical, no matter where you move to or how many times you change ISP.That said, running Pi-hole on a Raspberry pi is a treat! reply lostlogin 22 minutes agorootparentI used a EdgeRouter and it was amazing, though a little-hair raising as a complete rookie.The Unifi line solves this, and while it has some rough edges, it is so great. 9&#x2F;10. reply comprev 3 hours agorootparentprevConsider using NextDNS to help block ads on both individual devices and network-wide too. replycrisp 12 hours agorootparentprevI think I belong to the generation that grew up using just Google so I cannot comment on quantification.The biggest difference for me is that on Kagi, the first results are always relevant instead of clutter&#x2F;ads that you see on Google. reply mypetocean 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been around to compare them all (and used to spend countless hours doing search engine research on Fravia&#x27;s \"web search lores\" website).Google represented a huge step up in search result quality generally. But in recent years, the quality has really slid – even while tuning results using more advanced Google features.I don&#x27;t think Google cares much about search result quality these days, except insofar as they have to keep a minimum threshold just to drive their ad and analytics revenue.There is a lot of opportunity for other search engines to make strides forward in quality relative to Google these days. reply Falkon1313 5 hours agorootparentOne of the big differences is that at some point they seemed to basically delist forums, de-rank most blogs, and totally forgot that personal web pages still exist. All those things are still out there, but you are highly unlikely to find them via Google now. Maybe if you do an exact phrase search for the page&#x27;s title, otherwise, they&#x27;re buried.Another is that they tried to get too helpful and it backfired. There used to be a bunch of search operators that you could use to be specific and most of them don&#x27;t work anymore. Because that was too complicated for most people. So now instead Google just ignores what you searched for and tries to guess what you actually meant, and ends up showing a lot of irrelevant results, some of which don&#x27;t match what you searched for at all.The third is that nowadays almost always, Google tries to spin it into a commercial request. The top results are usually for e-commerce sites or something selling products or services, no matter what you search for. It always assumes you&#x27;re trying to buy something, not trying to find information.I switched to duckduckgo years ago, and it generally gives much better results, but even it seems to be slipping a bit now. Still way better than the modernized Google, but for how long? reply root_axis 8 hours agorootparentprevThe results are worse because the Internet is worse. reply dazc 4 hours agorootparentExactly, the incentive to produce good quality content is no longer there. reply hyperhopper 4 hours agorootparentprevI, like any person in 2023 should, use unlock origin so I never see ads on Google. reply zoklet-enjoyer 12 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s how Google was when I was a kid reply louthy 11 hours agorootparentprevWhen I first signed up for Kagi, I found myself just searching for fun.

I say ‘biro’ for pens and say ‘twink’ for that white stuff.I don’t think it really matters as long as meaning is there.Though ‘Google’ is starting to mean ‘ad infested trash’, so maybe the word will lose favour. reply ldx1024 5 hours agorootparentprevI think if Kagi was the established leader and Google was the challenger you would be saying the opposite. reply helboi4 1 hour agorootparentNo it&#x27;s the actual word. \"google it\" allows for a liaison between the two words because \"google\" technically ends with an l sound (a consanant) and \"it\" begins with with a vowel - \"googlit\". It&#x27;s also a soft sorta rolling consanant, which helps. In the case of \"kagi it\", \"kagi\" ends in an I and \"it\" begins in an I. That means you have to make a hard stop between the two words and pronounce clearly to differentiate between one I and the other otherwise you lose the words entirely. The two words fail to flow into each other in any way, making them feel less like a pair. Phrases that are easy and satisfying to say in the sense that they are actually just easy to get your mouth around are more likely to catch on. This is definitely something they should consider more carefully.One could also argue that google is a pretty nice word for the English language since it evokes words like \"look\", \"oggle\", \"oodles\", implying looking through a lot of stuff and having a playful tone. Sounds silly but when someone says words sound like they mean something, it is a real phenomenon due to the way we interpret various sounds. In most languages, B sounds sound like big and round things and K sounds sound like sharp things. There have been studies on this. You can then get more specific in the subconscious patterns people recognise when you narrow it down to a certain language. This is why I say, Google is a great word for its function in the English language. reply paradox460 1 hour agorootparentprevKagit reply matt-attack 3 hours agorootparentprevDo you retain search logs? reply claytongulick 5 hours agorootparentprevMy biggest question - and the one that will drive me to subscribe right now is how \"harmful\" \"misinformation\" and \"malinformation\" is treated today, and how it will be in the future.I Do Not Want anything or anyone deciding what is good for me, what I should be seeing, or making it difficult for me to find things I&#x27;m searching for, regardless of the content.A search engine should be like the phone company - providing a pipe to content and allowing me to decide what I want to see &#x2F; block.If I want to search for Nazi propaganda because I want to understand why people believe the things they do - I don&#x27;t want the safety rails.

I switched to DDG a couple of years and seldom have to revert to Google but, to be fair, results tend to be about the same for most queries, save a few nuances.Kagi are getting a lot of love around here, likely because they block a few annoying domains and boost some others.The real problem is the quality of free to access sites generally available and this is a problem that&#x27;s not so simple to solve. reply devjab 4 hours agorootparentprevI switched to Ecoasia when BG3 released and a search for “BG3 wiki” didn’t turn up the actual wiki site on Google. Maybe it’s because it’s on a .wiki subdomain (I’m only 90% sure that’s what it’s at since I haven’t used it for a couple of weeks, but it’s on some “odd” subdomain), but Google returned a plethora of useless wiki sites that were frankly so terrible it hurt. I believe the Duck had largely the same issue, but Ecoasia didn’t.Anyway, I switched mostly at a joke at first. I had tried replacing Google with DuckDuckGo a few times, and it’s just not good enough. At least not for my searches (and I am Danish, with a work VPN in Holland, so there is that issue to confuse it). Anyway Ecoasia has turned out to be great. I do still use the !g feature once in a while, but far, far, less often than I did on the Duck. It’s actually mostly for when I want to buy stuff since Google is better at listing Danish shops. reply mypetocean 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I use DDG by default now, and only use Google for hard searches – and even then, I&#x27;m continually surprised by the frequency of terrible search results on Google these days. reply pierat 11 hours agorootparentprevOh Yandex is AWESOME, especially for tech, porn, and piracy.

I suppose it is mostly just aimed at Americans. reply willisjs 4 minutes agorootparentThere is a hard price floor. They have to pay the Bing&#x2F;Google search API costs. reply jchw 11 hours agorootparentprevSome platforms actually do account for this by having special \"developing countries\" discounts, or some other euphemism like that. IIRC Gumroad is one that supports this. reply g_p 10 hours agorootparentThis is an interesting challenge.Part of the difficulty in doing this at early stage (without VC) is that your costs often don&#x27;t scale in proportion to customer ability to pay.A big chunk of the costs of running Kagi will come from external search indexes - their founder is active here and was pretty open about the impacts on costs when Bing raised their API pricing significantly. That&#x27;s just one player in the market, but when Bing raises their prices, they don&#x27;t offer discounts to make it cheaper for developing countries for users downstream.With investment or a significant customer base in full-price countries, it&#x27;s easier to subsidize a lower price model for developing markets. Trouble is, businesses like Kagi aren&#x27;t in the business of getting eyeballs today for future monetization (which works fine as justification to grow user stats if someone else is footing the server bills, and is willing to buy future growth).It&#x27;s certainly an imperfect setup, but regional pricing seems an interesting challenge to make work without relying on external investment. reply somsak2 11 hours agorootparentprevPretty funny that when textbook publishers try to do this, people really hate it. reply jchw 10 hours agorootparentI think most people have a negative kneejerk reaction to asymmetrical pricing when they&#x27;re the ones paying more. Generally for most things, the cost of delivering a product or service doesn&#x27;t vary too much based on factors like local living wages, so at the end of the day, you&#x27;re paying more margin than some other people are. In some cases, maybe your group is flat-out subsidizing other groups.It does seem people&#x27;s opinions on this are cultural and situational, though. Like many people do not feel particularly upset by a veteran or senior discount. But for textbooks, I think most people feel like the massive margins publishers push are already unreasonable and thus the existence of asymmetric pricing is actually evidence that the margins are larger than necessary.Not sure, though. Most practices that involve some form of discrimination are bound to be controversial in some way. (Even describing them using the term &#x27;discrimination&#x27; is sometimes controversial due to the connotations that the word carries, but alas.) reply paradox460 1 hour agorootparentSome people will even go out of their way to abuse a pricing scheme to get things for far cheaper. See cdkeys selling Xbox live cards from Argentina, for example reply somsak2 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is a company, not a charity. reply selcuka 9 hours agorootparent> This is a company, not a charity.By this logic they should increase their prices to $1,000,000&#x2F;mo. They are not a charity, right? Why would they sell it for a measly $10?The point is, pricing is adjusted to maximise profitability. If lowering the price for a specific market increases your profitability, you would go for it. There is a sweet spot, but it is not the same for every customer. You need segmentation to fully utilise the potential. reply Mathiciann 31 minutes agorootparentKeep in mind that executing the searches has a cost for Kagi.I remember I could see my usage which was about 700 searches per month and which costed ~8$ I think. My subscription was 10$ so 2$ would go to pay their devs and to R&D. So they can&#x27;t really go lower then 10$ for specific markets. reply carlosjobim 9 hours agorootparentprev>This number really varies based on where you liveNo, it varies based on who you are.

Google results are full of SEO spam, marketing pages, etc. Kagi tends to surface official documentation, blog posts, online discussion&#x2F;Q&A. Overall, it does a very good job highlighting “real” content rather than “artificial” content. Plus, you can personalize it by boosting&#x2F;downranking&#x2F;blocking sites, creating regex rewrite rules on URLs, etc. reply daft_pink 12 hours agorootparentprevI think it is better most of the time because:- it combines the top 10 this or that list into listicles that are aggregated into their own section and I find to often be full of spam - it lets you block or deprioritize any site you want like quora, medium, Forbes, that often give me useless or incorrect info or are just their to boost so - it lets you prioritize sites you like in the search ranking - it doesn’t have blocked or censored keywords - it lets you specify by date or time quickly and easily which I find to be beneficial and google seems to hide it constantly move around in newsIt’s weaker for like looking up a phone number or hours for a local eatery, but in general I like it better. reply r3trohack3r 12 hours agorootparentprevFor me, it&#x27;s substantially better.The results are good by default. But you can change the ranking of sites in your results, so every search is custom to you.I pin documentation sites like MDN and pkg.go.dev and penalize SEO span sites.My results are custom to me and my workflows, it&#x27;s pretty hard to go back at this point.Kagi is one of the stickiest subscription services I have. reply andyjohnson0 12 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience it&#x27;s far, far better than google search. The ability to boost some domains and block others is invaluable.But also, because you&#x27;re the customer not the product, you don&#x27;t have to contend with Google&#x27;s ad-driven search results and their privacy violating bs.

Yes with the new \"Play System Updates\" there&#x27;s better security coverage, but it&#x27;s still a gap compared to supported hardware. reply Cyphase 6 hours agorootparentI had to read your comment extra carefully to realize that you weren&#x27;t saying LineageOS is _behind_ on updates for the baseband&#x2F;etc., but rather that it only extends availability of Android updates, not baseband updates, due to the baseband being proprietary and updates no longer being released by the OEM.In other words, LineageOS provides the latest Android and baseband updates available; it&#x27;s just that for the baseband, \"latest\" can be a lot older than for Android, if your phone hardware is no longer supported by the OEM. reply muppetman 3 hours agorootparentYea, that&#x27;s what I was trying to say.

It was even more annoying because when attempting to get to \"Internet Options\" or \"File Explorer\", it automatically replaced those with Edge, which is not at all helpful.This effort was also completely undone by the fact that if you misspelled Internet Explorer it would still come right up as the first option.I&#x27;m still upset that they&#x27;ve removed most Control Panel results from the start menu search as well, because after all these years the Settings app is still incomplete. reply judge2020 10 hours agorootparent> My favorite was when they wanted everyone to switch over from Internet Explorer to Edge (this was before support was dropped), so attempting to search \"Internet Explorer\" in the start menu caused it to override it with Edge instead.Was this before or after they actually removed iexplore.exe? reply vanchor3 9 hours agorootparentThis was at least several months before, maybe more.I&#x27;m not actually sure they even fully removed it.

There are exceptions to this, like \"suggestions\" in the Start menu, but outside of this it&#x27;s designed in a user-first way.(Desktop) Linux, on the other hand, seems to be more of an intellectual experiment designed to please the people who are writing it rather than a consumer-focused product.

Lost some work like this and had to do some tinkering, not sure if register or otherwise. Or maybe I just disabled automatic updates I guess.So, in conclusion, no, an OS taking control off my hands forcefully is not user-centered, no matter how much in programming circles updates are seen as \"crucial\". Nothing is more crucial than the computer being predictable to its owner. reply wpm 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not when it reboots in the middle of the night while you had open documents and apps, and the OS didn’t save any of that.However, the forced reboots are trivial to disable in Group Policy. reply iopq 39 minutes agorootparentI can&#x27;t use Group Policy because when I upgraded from Windows 8, it upgraded to Home editionit&#x27;s Home edition because that&#x27;s what came with the laptop&#x27;s Windows 8, it was never an issue on Windows 8 because you could disable stuff on Windows 8 without using Group Policy reply Kye 6 hours agorootparentprevPeople forget the security hell that preceded Microsoft&#x27;s obsession with updates. You get half the internet&#x27;s bandwidth used by a worm or you get forced updates. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone propose a viable compromise. reply spongebobstoes 3 hours agorootparentthe right solution is updates that don&#x27;t require any restart or service interruption. but that is technically difficult atm reply jholman 5 hours agorootparentprevThat list mostly seems a bit odd.This Windows computer doesn&#x27;t force reboots (though it does nag me), it hasn&#x27;t tried to trick me to upgrade to 11, it isn&#x27;t sending telemetry to MS, it has never forced me to sign up for a non-local account.I think it does force security updates on me, which I think is clearly pro-user, though arguably not respectful.I also decided to use Edge to access my job&#x27;s shitty Outlook stuff, and every ten minutes Edge tries to trick me into doing something, including but not restricted to making itself the default (you can pry my Firefox from my cold dead...). Until I decided to try Edge, it has not ever done anything to try to get me to use Edge.That said, I&#x27;m not agreeing with GP that Windows \"has more respect for the user than Linux does\", that just seems confused to me. But I also think that I read a lot of criticism of Windows that seems laughable. reply Accacin 2 hours agorootparentPreviously when I installed Windows, I had the option to create a local account. I had to click on a few misdirections but I was able to do it.Recently though, I had to reinstall Windows to do something, and I could not find a way to create a local account at all. AFAIK they removed the option now, or made it much harder to find. reply sodality2 4 hours agorootparentprev> it isn&#x27;t sending telemetry to MSHow? Literally even LTSC builds have some amounts of telemetry. Are you running some nonstandard build of Windows? reply jholman 4 hours agorootparentWell, maybe I&#x27;m wrong about that. It&#x27;s a standard build of Home, with an hour or two invested in config maybe a decade ago when I installed it (back when it was 7, or something, before 10 existed). I spent a little time on Wireshark seeing what it was doing, but not much time, and that was a long time ago. So maybe I&#x27;m wrong. :thinking: reply Falkon1313 3 hours agorootparentprevMine doesn&#x27;t do any of that. (Except maybe the telemetry, which I don&#x27;t care about.) You&#x27;ve configured yours wrong if it is doing that. reply magic_hamster 6 hours agorootparentprev> (Desktop) Linux, on the other hand, seems to be more of an intellectual experiment designed to please the people who are writing it rather than a consumer-focused productHonestly can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re joking, but I guess yes. Linux is the most stable OS I&#x27;ve ever used. There&#x27;s a reason most mission critical and online services that require constant uptime run almost exclusively on Linux.Windows used to have a nice GUI attached to a mostly unstable system. That was 20 years ago. Now Windows feels like a predatory product that&#x27;s borderline unusable. reply laserbeam 6 hours agorootparent> There&#x27;s a reason most mission critical and online services that require constant uptime run almost exclusively on Linux.That argument only applies to servers. Places where you don&#x27;t need to wrangle x11, the audio stack, gpu drivers for less common cards, conflicting gtk and qt versions for different apps you might use on a whim, hidpi support in old apps, theming issues... I&#x27;ve no idea how many of these are still a plague these days, but they certainly have been for long.Servers are way more predictable linux configurations.For desktop, win32 is as solid as it gets (too bad it&#x27;s shipped within a desktop filled with increasingly many dark patterns). reply iopq 37 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t need to wrangle with x11 because I use Wayland, and I don&#x27;t need to wrangle with the audio stack because I use pipewireWhat year is this post from? reply davkan 4 hours agorootparentprevAudio has come a long way, pipewire just works in my experience. And Wayland is in daily driver territory, so X11 is only needed if you have some specific requirements. Steamdeck&#x2F;proton has massively improved gaming.That’s not to say it’s not still Linux, there will be some tinkering. But compared to a decade ago there’s way less banging my head against the wall.If you’re already competent in administration Linux you might find it’s time to revisit the desktop. reply nighmi 1 hour agorootparentprevYou are thinking of BSD, which is far more stable than Linux for servers etc. reply iopq 40 minutes agorootparentprevI couldn&#x27;t disable the anti-virus in Windows 10 that kept checking my hard drive (yes, my laptop is so old it has a hard drive) and making it slow downthen I just downloaded a program that let me disable it, and I also disabled the firewallbut without the firewall service, I can&#x27;t get updates (why is that service a pre-requisite for updates?), and I forgot how to re-enable it because I don&#x27;t remember what program I used to disable it since it&#x27;s some hack anywayso now my Windows partition is not really usable, and I&#x27;m typing this on Linux where I can just change stuff without breaking everything reply jxi 7 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s more ads on a clean install of Windows than most streets of New York City. Why does a professional OS come with Candy Crush installed by default? reply hresvelgr 8 hours agorootparentprev> Hot take, but IMO Windows has far more respect for the user than Linux does.You need to be more specific about what desktop Linux flavours aren&#x27;t holding up in your eyes because window managers like XFCE and Cinnamon are bulletproof as far as I&#x27;m concerned and I&#x27;ve never had issues with them. Especially XFCE.> there&#x27;s no single dominant standard.This is a common criticism and I totally get you here. Not knowing what&#x27;s going to work for you is annoying and truthfully, no one really wants to shop around for window managers and the only reason I know what&#x27;s good in the first place is because I spent weeks in my youth test driving everything available, something I no longer have the energy for. reply Aeolun 1 hour agorootparentprev> Everything is far more QA&#x27;d (and designed to be QA-able) and at least tries to minimise user frustration. There are exceptions to this, like \"suggestions\" in the Start menu, but outside of this it&#x27;s designed in a user-first way.I feel like windows is deliberate about being user hostile. Just because they&#x27;re very slick about being user hostile doesn&#x27;t make it any different.Linux feels like someone with my best interests at heart made a good attempt and half succeeded. reply resonious 1 hour agorootparentprevYour take on desktop Linux is quite accurate, but Windows feels less QA&#x27;d than Linux to me nowadays. Windows will give me a popup begging for a reboot, then when I reboot it asks for another reboot. For months there was a bug where the settings window would become tiny and resizing didn&#x27;t work. The Microsoft Teams \"get started\" window takes on the order of 30 seconds to close - that is I click the X button, no immediate reaction, and then it closes half a minute later. reply gridlocdev 6 hours agorootparentprevMaybe 5-10 years ago, but today’s Linux desktop has evolved to be much more user friendly and stable. Applications have a standard containerized format (Flatpak), the most popular distributions ship a software store to update your apps and system with one click, and the stability of things has improved to a point where (in my experience) things almost never break unless you’re running the absolute bleeding-edge latest-gen hardware. I would highly recommend giving it a shot if you haven’t at least tried it as a daily driver before. (To get started, just look up a tutorial for how to dual-boot with Windows or play around with it in a Virtual Machine) reply dade_ 8 hours agorootparentprevWindows has never respected users. Not in version 3.0, and not today in 11. Millennium Edition and Vista were particularly egregious, and 11 took it to a brave new world.There is no such thing as a single Linux experience, each distribution targets different personas and goals.If you want a curated Linux desktop experience, then try Elementary OS. It is very aligned to a Mac experience. reply kyruzic 8 hours agorootparentprevNone of what you said is true. Use gnome and a popular distribution. Everything will just work out of the box. reply hobofan 2 hours agorootparentWith popOS maybe, but I would never hand Ubuntu Desktop to a non-dev. I can&#x27;t remember the last time where it properly installed (including getting NVIDIA drivers working) without using the terminal. reply iopq 36 minutes agorootparentUbuntu installed just fine for me. Broke on update, though reply hresvelgr 8 hours agorootparentprevEh, honestly with GNOME ymmv. Many API breakages, most recently with extensions in version 45. It&#x27;s also not very light. GNOME&#x27;s UX is also quite opinionated but some people like that. reply behnamoh 7 hours agorootparentprev> Use gnome ...Yeah no. You often need to install extensions to get icons on the desktop etc., which break when you upgrade Gnome. Talk about user-hostile design. reply replwoacause 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is an extraordinarily uninformed take reply DavideNL 4 hours agoparentprevYou should check out Pop!_OSI went from Windows to Pop!_OS, and was surprised how it just worked flawlessly on all my hardware right after installing, the UI is nice too. reply nikodunk 1 hour agoparentprevWhat an inspiring post. I&#x27;m like on the Nebula step already - will follow your path though :D reply pentae 7 hours agoparentprevI would love to use Nebula but it seems to lean quite politically in one direction (as I suspect from a Canadian platform) which seems like something I don&#x27;t want to support with my dollars. At least on YouTube I can find a diverse range of opinions reply tekknik 6 hours agorootparentThanks, they’ve likely got another customer now. Freedom of speech is worth protecting. reply flexagoon 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t have a Nebula account, but I checked their feed a while ago and they seem to have a variety of opinions, at least for videos about politics&#x2F;economics. I found both socialist channels (eg. \"Second Thought\") and liberal&#x2F;pro-market channels (eg. \"PolyMatter\"). I&#x27;m not sure if they have any right-wing&#x2F;republican channels though, so if that&#x27;s what you want, perhaps it is not for you reply SalmoShalazar 1 hour agorootparentprevThere’s a lean towards thoughtful, educational content on Nebula reply dzogchen 1 hour agoparentprevYou &#x27;installed&#x27; OpenStreetMaps?! reply BoppreH 1 hour agorootparentAh, sorry, I meant an app that uses OSM as data source (OrganicMaps in my case). For some reason I thought I had an \"official\" app the OSM project, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be so casual with the name.And a shout-out to StreetComplete, that gamifies contributing to OSM. reply wowgoldfarmer 2 hours agoparentprevI tried kagi a little bit and the search results is very good compared to other engines reply Melatonic 10 hours agoparentprevYou might really like Windows 10 LTSC 2021 - it has all the crap stripped out and retains all core functionality reply doublerabbit 10 hours agoparentprev> I might ditch Windows next.Tryout FreeBSD.

Gary Steele President & CEO, Splunk Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on Splunk’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, its business and industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by Splunk and Cisco, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “expect,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Splunk’s business and other conditions to the completion of the transaction; (ii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Splunk’s business and general economic conditions; (iii) Splunk’s ability to implement its business strategy; (iv) significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction; (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction; (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Splunk’s business, including current plans and operations; (vii) the ability of Splunk to retain and hire key personnel; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Splunk’s business; (x) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xi) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Splunk operates; (xii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect Splunk’s financial performance; (xiii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Splunk’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; and (xiv) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Splunk’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in the Proxy Statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Proxy Statement will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Splunk’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Splunk does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.

Is that the wrong take? reply bradleyjg 1 hour agorootparentNot that I recommend you try this, but my understanding is that if a careless splunk executive were talking about the merger on the phone at the local coffee shop and you, a total stranger, happened to overhear you could trade on that without it being a crime. reply theogravity 12 hours agorootparentprevThe not-insider-trading possibility:It&#x27;s possible someone was selling contracts as a hedge since the tech market has been really bad this week. A market maker was obligated to buy the contracts.The person selling the contracts gets $22k in premium, and misses out on the pop. The market maker will absolutely exercise the contracts and profit.(This is coming from someone who sold APPL calls expiring tomorrow for .08 at a high strike today)Personal opinion: It&#x27;s insider trading. You&#x27;d need a ton of shares to be able to sell $22k worth of contracts at a high strike unless you&#x27;re doing naked options selling. reply qeternity 11 hours agorootparentThis is not quite how things work. Market makers don’t just take risk and not hedge. They would have hedged deltas (by shorting stock) and gamma&#x2F;vega by selling other stuff (or this offset stuff they had sold previously). Impossible to say whether an MM would have made or lost money but usually gap moves like this cost MM on a net basis. reply theogravity 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right, and it&#x27;s something I should have mentioned. reply hyeomans 10 hours agorootparentprevI understood nothing of what you said, what is a good resource&#x2F;starting point to understand the meaning of this? reply theogravity 10 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;o&#x2F;optionscontract.aspIn terms of how the market maker is involved:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectfinance.com&#x2F;options-market-maker&#x2F;hedging:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectfinance.com&#x2F;what-is-delta-hedging&#x2F; reply Sebguer 13 hours agorootparentprevMatt Levine&#x27;s money stuff offered the hypothesis that it could just be normal gambling. But, it&#x27;s almost definitely insider trading, and either way, someone will definitely be getting an SEC visit. reply posnet 11 hours agorootparentThey also directly broke Levine&#x27;s second rule of insider trading.2.

I guess you can&#x27;t remove the idea that the information was found through some open means. For all we know the private jets of the Cisco leaders might have been in the same location as those from Splunk. reply aodin 13 hours agorootparentThey bought 1-day options, so they knew the timing of the announcement. reply noselasd 11 hours agorootparentDid anyone do the same the two days ago?

And so on.It is certainly no secret that Cisco wanted to buy Splunk for $20BN in Februart 2022 reply arcticbull 9 hours agorootparentprevSounds like something one of the very special folks on WallStreetBets would have done on the basis of half-baked \"dd.\" reply secfirstmd 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah true. Pretty hard to figure out that accurately from open sources. reply fatnoah 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have the knowledge or the patience to find out, but it would be interesting see the overall pattern of 1 day calls on Splunk stock to see if this was an outlier. reply roozbeh18 13 hours agorootparentprevEasy for sec to identify affiliation to Splunk for this call. reply kabes 12 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the chance the sec will go after this? I guess they don&#x27;t have the capacity to go after all these cases, even the clear cut ones reply positr0n 7 hours agorootparentI think the SEC loves cut and dry cases like this. You see enforcement actions all the time about similar situations.

The difference with Meraki, compared to the typical Cisco acquisition, is how independently they were allowed to operate. WebEx was a similar story. Cisco would tell you that acquisition is a core competency of theirs[1], but having worked there for 8 years (including during the WebEx and Meraki acquisitions,) I&#x27;d say their track record is far more spotty. A few successes like Meraki, a bunch of mediocre examples and a few really bad ones, like Scientific Atlanta.0 - Even switching originally came to Cisco via a whole series of acquisitions in the 90s. You could argue -- and Stanford certainly did -- that routing was an acquisition of sorts, as well.1 - Their M&A guy even wrote a book about it, called Doing Both, which purported to explain how Cisco achieved so many of their goals by refusing to make false \"either&#x2F;or\" decisions. Ironically, almost every example in the book was something that Cisco is spectacularly bad at. reply PeterCorless 14 hours agorootparentI sat in on the all Cisco acquisitions teams from c. 1994 - 1999. Even during that heyday there were awesome acquisitions that took off and others that went nowhere. Cisco was historically always better at hardware acquisitions than pure-play software. It would often kill the software products entirely — Internet Junction, TGV, Precept come to mind.The one other rule that John Chambers lived by was \"no merger of equals.\" It was always about a big fish swallowing a smaller one. Cisco&#x27;s market cap is an order of magnitude greater than Splunk&#x27;s, but this is as close to breaking that Chambers Rule of Acquisitions as anything they&#x27;ve done to date.Here&#x27;s the full history of Cisco acquisitions. Maybe someone with more M&A lore would scorecard it to see which were dreams and which were duds.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;about&#x2F;corporate-strategy-offic... reply marcus0x62 13 hours agorootparentI think they had better success integrating hardware companies, but SA — which was pretty much a hardware company — was a pretty big counter-example.

The people building it are formally trained, the government forces a minimum amount of safety testing, and a design mistake could cost millions to fix, besides the reputational damage. Software is more like getting retail workers to build a remote controlled forklift out of junkyard parts. reply TylerE 19 hours agorootparentprevScientific Atlanta… there’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time. Didn’t they use to make crappy cable boxes, back when cable TV meant a box that connected to the antenna input via coax. reply marcus0x62 19 hours agorootparentSA made set top boxes along with a bunch of back-end infrastructure to make them work. It was an acquisition that made sense on paper -- Cisco did (does) a lot of business with service providers, they make cable modem termination systems (the headend devices that handle cable modem connectivity,) had dabbled in IP video, so it was a natural evolution to make and sell the rest of the gear you&#x27;d need to operate a cable-based service provider. I don&#x27;t think they were counting on how rapidly Internet streaming would take over, but in any case, the acquisition didn&#x27;t work out so well and last I heard they had divested it.One other thing that I think feeds into these acquisition mishaps is that Cisco has, in my opinion, consistently over-estimated how much intelligence would be needed (or wanted) in the core network. In their view, intelligent network services = expensive network devices = revenue for Cisco. I think what the Internet specifically and IP in general, as well as the evolution of LAN technologies over time have proven is that when it comes to the core network, simple is almost always better and intelligence should move to the edge, where innovation can happen quicker and where services can be implemented in software.As an example, at one point they had what was, essentially, a middleware system (like Websphere,) which they called Application Oriented Networking. The idea was you would deploy these on your network gear, throughout your network, and it would provide message routing and translation services. They had a whole \"architecture\" built for it, called Services Oriented Network Architecture[0]. I don&#x27;t think the people who built it really understood that it provided no real advantage over a cluster of middleware&#x2F;ESB&#x2F;MQ servers in a data center and that nobody was going to pay a huge premium to build that capability in their IP routers.0 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;dam&#x2F;global&#x2F;it_it&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;ent&#x2F;tecno... reply drdec 9 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t think they were counting on how rapidly Internet streaming would take overIronically, those set top makers were in a perfect position to take advantage of it.

The STB companies also, as a general rule, were really bad at UX -- there&#x27;s a reason why the interface on those things was universally bad, and it&#x27;s that the cable companies were the customer of the STB maker, not the end consumer. SA and the rest of them just didn&#x27;t have consumer UX expertise as a real competency and didn&#x27;t need to have it. reply TylerE 18 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking way earlier than that. My grandparents had a Scientific Atlanta box connected to their giant piece-of-furtniture Hughs and Mathis TV. This was late 80s, early 90s, long before digital TV, or cable having more than 30 or 40 channels. reply marcus0x62 17 hours agorootparentI believe they made equipment related to cable&#x2F;satellite TV as far back as the 70s. reply biggerstep 15 hours agorootparentYep.

Was a lot of fun as digital settops rolled out, then DVR, then HDTV. As others have noted, the Cisco acquisition in 2006 did not, uh, work out too well. I believe Cisco had visions of video control \"in the network\", but that was never going to work for extant cable systems, and we couldn&#x27;t get an IPTV solution going for lots of reasons.

Structured logs and Splunk are the stuff dreams are made of if you care about monitoring the quality of software.The logs into metrics abilities along with the ability to unlock finding relationships in data is amazing. Mouse over the fields found in logs matching your search and see the top N values for other these keys.Imagine getting an alert and being able to search your logs for that error message and immediately being able to see it affects these N users disproportionally, that it is split 50&#x2F;50 in two of your seven regions, only affects version X of your service. A couple more searches to dig in and you can see it is only feature Y with setting Z that is the problem. You switch to a timechart view and can see the moment the error started and the affected user counts. A few more minutes and your support team has a list of known affected users. You decide to monitor this new feature so you quickly create a new dashboard (or panel on an existing dashboard) and a new alert. At no time did you have to declare a field of your structured logs as an index or as searchable or aggregatable. reply 0xEFF 6 hours agorootparentSplunk has delivered this level of innovation and quality since 2007 when I first used it.We used Splunk to associate a change request ticket number all the way through the change control process to the Puppet log output tagging each change to the original business purpose.It was like magic for auditors back then and I rarely see that depth of tracing automated changes to business purpose in the field today, though we get close with gitops. reply jitl 11 hours agorootparentprevWe [Notion] switched to Splunk Cloud a year or so ago, and it&#x27;s vastly better than the other logging systems we&#x27;ve used.

They talk to the higher-ups and either make them happy, or feed them a lot of FUD (or both), and then they&#x27;re in, regardless of what the people working with the products (many of whom might be external vendors or consultants!) think.They&#x27;re basically focused on more traditional sales & marketing instead of more grassroots sales & marketing (mindshare), but at least in my experience they definitely still get new customers. reply frankchn 17 hours agorootparentprev> Mindshare is valuable, was the point GP was making.

This was in the age of graphite which was great for aggregating metrics cheap but not getting detail.Splunk was used by a much larger product (easily 10x our scale) for monitoring events so there was no red tape to start using it.After launching the detailed instrumentation (1 structured log event per HTTP request with a breakout of database&#x2F;service activity) I was able to gain all of the insight needed and build a simple user&#x2F;url lookup dashboard page to help other engineers see what was going on. We went from being mostly blind to almost full visibility in less than two weeks.The downside was, we increased our billable Splunk usage by 50% since we were capturing so much more data per log event than the other product just consuming standard IIS&#x2F;Apache logs.That type of flexibility was totally worth it. Due to some acquisition shenanigans we broke off from that group and wound up on ELK stack which didn&#x27;t perform quite as well, but was still usable with the same data.

Custom pipeline, integrations in multiple languages, high resolution, custom aggregation and rollups. It was nice. We also had in-house logging, exception tracing, alerting, service discovery, metrics dashboards, etc. It was all actually pretty good. All engineered by xooglers.Someone (not to name names) got bitten by the \"anti-weirdware\" bug and started shifting us off of all our custom-built solutions. Every team got hit with major distractions from their roadmaps for each of these changes. None of the headcount dedicated to staffing the internal systems was freed up - they had to run the new integrations.The decision was made one day to migrate all of our observability stuff over to SignalFx. Observability wasn&#x27;t our \"core competency\" and our systems were \"weirdware\".We had to rewrite our instrumentation, all of our reporting dashboards, and all of our alerting DSLs changed. They were not replaced 1:1 for every system and metric, so we emerged in a much worse, much less visible situation across the board. Outages happened or went unreported.Splunk acquired SignalFx and dramatically raised prices. We scrambled to do the migration process yet again, impacting roadmaps and leading to more outages.Leadership was changed.There&#x27;s one thing to be said about NIH, but when you write systems that are already working, inexpensive, and easy to maintain, you shouldn&#x27;t throw them out because you&#x27;re worried analytics isn&#x27;t your \"core competency\".

Esp. when there weren&#x27;t any simple distributed storage operators.They have been a cockroach in the orgs, surviving every downturn. As a dev, you might hate it, CISO and CIOs love it. Orgs, often mandate it. The way they dominated the market is via creating CEF formats, integrations. It is more than a logging solution right now. It is an XDR, threat analysis platform etc.This acquisition is going to be interesting with app dynamics+splunk and others, it feels like there is a larger play here for Cisco.I don&#x27;t think the value that splunk have is transitive to ES or grafana.

Splunk is very expensive, ElasticSearch is still lacking many of the features of Splunk and when hosted on AWS is very expensive. SumoLogic was acquired by private equity, which means that it won&#x27;t get cheaper. DataDog is also very expensive.Solution like SnowFlake for logs &#x2F; telemetry where compute and storage are separated might be the future. reply cliffcrosland 8 hours agoparentWe’re also giving this a shot. The annual Splunk bill at our last startup exploded from $10k to $1M when we reached 1TB of logs generated per day, which is actually an easy threshold to hit when you have decent traction and aren’t proactively reducing logs. So we built Scanner.dev to drop these costs by 10x.Decoupling compute and storage is definitely the way to go. We’re using Lambda functions and ECS Fargate containers for compute that scales up and down rapidly, and S3 for storage. Getting ~1TB&#x2F;sec log scan speeds, which feels fairly good. We keep sparse indices in S3 to narrow down regions of logs to scan. Eg. if you’re searching for an IP address that appears 10 times in a 25TB log set, the indices reduce the search space to around 300MB. Takes a few seconds to complete that query, whereas Athena and CloudWatch take like 20 minutes.We’re also using Rust to maximize memory efficiency and speed - there are lots of great SIMD optimized string search and regex libraries on crates.io.We’re early, so there are a lot of SIEM features like detection rules that we are still building.

Studio Ghibli will be headed by Hiroyuki Fukuda, the senior operating officer and board director at Nippon TV. Studio Ghibli President Toshio Suzuki will assume the position of chairman, while Hayao Miyazaki, the famed filmmaker and co-creator of the studio, will be its honorary chairman. Nippon TV made the decision at a board of director’s meeting on Thursday, with Studio Ghibli approving the deal the same day. The broadcaster will own 42.3% of Studio Ghibli’s shares. The deal comes amid speculation over the future leadership of the studio. Miyazaki is 82 and Suzuki is 75. ”For a long time, it has been a concern who will take over the studio,” Studio Ghibli said in a press release. Studio Ghibli said in the release that there had been discussions in the past about Goro Miyazaki, Hayao Miyazaki's eldest son and animation director at the company, taking over. However, the studio said it decided it would be better to put the future of the company in someone else’s hands, with Goro Miyazaki believing it would be too difficult to bear the responsibility on his own, according to the press release. Goro’s strained relationship with his father has been widely reported. Nippon TV will be handling management operations, allowing Studio Ghibli to focus more on the creative side, according to the press release. Since 1985, the television network has maintained close ties with the animation studio, when the former aired “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” on TV for the first time. The network has frequently aired Ghibli films on Friday Roadshow, which sees the weekly broadcast of feature-length films. Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by Suzuki, Miyazaki and the late director Isao Takahata. The studio has achieved both domestic and international acclaim for hit films such as the Oscar-winning “Spirited Away,” “The Tale of The Princess Kaguya,” “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Princess Mononoke.” Ghibli Park opened in November in Aichi Prefecture and Goro Miyazaki was tasked with overseeing the theme park.

This is near the better end of possible outcomes given at least they have a track record of respecting legacy and showing the value of archives.The idea that Ghibli as a major production concern would outlast Hayao Miyazaki was obvious nonsense, and you can almost feel the relief of Goro. reply hinkley 17 hours agorootparentThere are adults now that grew up with Ghibli films. And not just from HBO playing an abridged Nausicaa on a loop as filler.Certainly Miyazaki has succeeded in keeping the wheels on long enough that there’s a cadre of people out there that have a deep psychological investment in preserving the legacy.It won’t be Miyazaki’s Ghibli, but it could be something. reply jonhohle 16 hours agorootparentBut why can’t it be something else? Does the name matter apart from the creators?If I see Miyazaki on a poster, I’m going to be interested. There’s been enough Ghibli without him that I know the studio isn’t magic, it’s him.

I think this also comes less as a shock as the new generation of directors have a number of studios willing to give them a chance (including new studios beasically founded for a single director, or even single piece).Ghibli can stay an icon of a glorious past area, in good hands. reply HenryBemis 19 hours agorootparent\"We&#x27;ll Always Have Paris\" is the phrase that came to my mind. If we are lucky, the Ghibli will be the empty shell holding the royalties&#x2F;rights&#x2F;etc of the Miyazaki (and other) produced movies.If we are unlucky, someone will use the brand name to start producing (en masse) garbage, selling it to Netflix, and Netflix will be pushing garbage low-quality, hi-speed cartoons. reply nordsieck 19 hours agorootparent> If we are unlucky, someone will use the brand name to start producing (en masse) garbage, selling it to Netflix, and Netflix will be pushing garbage low-quality, hi-speed cartoons.I would really hate to see the Ghibli version of \"rings of power\" reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparent> I would really hate to see the Ghibli version of \"rings of power\"Then, don’t see it.Fans need to stop enabling these awful reboots: by withholding their wallets. These IP vampires are only motivated by money, and if we give them money as a reward for milking past franchises, then they will continue to do it. reply smolder 15 hours agorootparentI agree in principle, but it can be difficult in practice to vote with your wallet.In the case of movies, once you have a ticket or purchase it or even rent it, they&#x27;ve got your money and have learned the lesson that people will pay, regardless of how you felt about what you watched or whether you intend to boycott future productions.In general, though, I do try to send the signal that I&#x27;m not personally a garbage dump for low effort content, by doing a few things:- No \"guilty pleasure\" watching of things that I&#x27;d prefer didn&#x27;t exist, i.e. junk reality TV- Actively avoiding clicking on things that have clickbait titles, especially if they&#x27;re part of an algo-feed- Read reviews &#x2F; get reviews from friends first- If a streaming show is bad, stop watching ASAP. Stopping at episode 2&#x2F;10 is a reliable signal for Netflix et al. reply nordsieck 14 hours agorootparentYeah; I&#x27;ve come to the point where I don&#x27;t really want to watch \"fresh\" content. There&#x27;s so many great movies in the back catalog, I&#x27;ll probably never run out of great stuff to watch.And if there&#x27;s something great that&#x27;s come out, I&#x27;ll check it out after a couple of years when the reviews have settled down and all of the parts (I&#x27;m looking at you, Dune) have come out. reply Andrex 16 hours agorootparentprevPrime is subsidized by a million other things. Cancelling does not send a message, or rather, the message isn&#x27;t nearly specific enough to be interpreted by Amazon as \"we should make a better show and&#x2F;or stop making this one.\"The entire feedback loop for the media industry has been perverted by tech companies and Venture Capital vampires, and it wasn&#x27;t in a great place before. reply midoridensha 2 hours agorootparentHuh? I&#x27;m sure Amazon has no trouble gathering data about exactly how many of its Prime members are watching various shows&#x2F;movies on their service. They&#x27;re not going to pour money into something if no one is watching it. It&#x27;s not like the old days of regular TV where they needed Nielsen to try to guess how many people were watching something. reply tetris11 17 hours agorootparentprevPeople don&#x27;t vote with their wallets with clear minds though. People vote with half-asleep notions of what&#x27;s good based on an onslaught of direct and viral marketing combo that threatens to ostracize them from their various social&#x2F;support groups if they don&#x27;t consume said product. No one has the time and energy to fight that on every front, nor has the know-how in every conceivable field to understand what is a lie and what isn&#x27;t. reply dwighttk 19 hours agorootparentprevDon’t have to watch it… we’ll always have the books…maybe one day I’ll forget watching the first third of The Hobbit in 3D reply hx8 18 hours agorootparentAfter Game of Thrones season 3 I&#x27;ve began ignoring film adaptations of books I enjoy. I think the risk of tarnishing my experience with a good book is much worse than any possible film enhancement I&#x27;ve experienced.The screenshots from Blade Runner 2 and Dune do look cool though. reply toast0 17 hours agorootparentIMHO, Denis Villeneuve (and the rest of the crew) did a wonderful job with the visuals in Dune; there&#x27;s some aspects of it I don&#x27;t care for, but it definitely looks cool. But then again, I also think David Lynch (and the rest of the crew) did a wonderful job with the visuals in Dune, although somethings were a bit over the top; OTOH, I first watched this one when I was like 10 and got sucked in, so I&#x27;m not unbiased. I think both films did a great job of practical shooting that will continue to look good well into the future unlike a lot of recent films that are a lot of short takes in front of a green screen (cough Star Wars after the first two; most of Marvel cough). I&#x27;m looking forward to Dune: Part 2 this year, even if I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll dislike the same things I dislike from Dune: Part 1, because the visuals are likely to be going to be wonderful.The SciFi channel had zero budget and it showed; but I think they stuck to the book a lot better; but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever rewatch them, because the visuals are so bad.Anyway --- we can always treat adaptations as inspired by rather than based on. I, Robot is a fun action film that name drops the three laws, but is otherwise unconnected to the book. The song retains the name, as they say. reply dwighttk 12 hours agorootparent(Dune has been delayed to early next year) reply the_af 15 hours agorootparentprev> The screenshots from Blade Runner 2 and Dune do look cool though.Good news about Dune! It&#x27;s actually a good movie. It&#x27;s both close to the book and makes the right calls in changing what needs to be changed for the big screen. It looks amazing, too. Give it a chance.Bad news about Blade Runner 2: it&#x27;s not good. It looks good, but the movie is pointless and jarringly bad acted at times (Jared Leto, enough said). And I say this as someone who absolutely loves Blade Runner, so I&#x27;m not one of the naysayers who found it \"boring\". It&#x27;s not boring -- it&#x27;s bad and pointless. Someone here called it \"fanfiction\", and that&#x27;s what it is: fanfiction by a very competent director who doesn&#x27;t truly understand the source material. reply aftbit 18 hours agorootparentprevI only read the first Dune book, but I feel like the recent-ish movie did a pretty good job following what happened in the book. reply KineticLensman 16 hours agorootparentThe third Dune book (arguably the second) actually illustrates this general point about decline as well. Run screaming from the subsequent books reply yongjik 16 hours agorootparentI think the second and the third was okay, but the fourth was... hmm maybe \"decline\" is not the right word, it was as if I walked into my favorite coffee shop and they decided to drop a bunch of bricks and PVC pipes on my laps because that&#x27;s what they do now. (Can&#x27;t talk about later books - I kinda stopped there and never picked up again. Maybe I should.) reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agorootparentGod Emperor is a slog, but sets the groundwork for Heretics and Chapterhouse, and they&#x27;re in my opinion very good. I&#x27;ve re-read Chapterhouse more than any of the others.But I think he meant for there to be a final one to follow it, and so it closes off somewhat unsatisfactorily. reply dwighttk 12 hours agorootparentI always tell people to read the first one and stop or grit your teeth and read all of them…(Possible spoiler:)I was a little surprised in my last read through how small a part Duncan Idaho played until I got to the second book and remembered reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, not run scremaing! God Emperor and beyond are awesome. But they&#x27;re not the same thing, no. They&#x27;re far more philosophical, and kind of about something else.The Brian Herbert books are very bad. reply skjoldr 3 hours agorootparentprevDune has the opposite problem, the movie by itself is quite confusing and even boring to newcomers, but people who had read the book can really appreciate its effort to stay true to the source material. It is a very difficult story to adapt. reply jncfhnb 16 hours agorootparentprevBlade Runner 2 was a great film. I think made slightly worse by its connections to the original. But I would recommend it. It’s nice that it is far enough in the future that it is a different world concept and there is no inclination to care about the canon. reply the_af 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m a fan of Blade Runner and really disliked Blade Runner 2.To be honest, it didn&#x27;t stand a chance with me: BR2 is a movie that didn&#x27;t need to get made. Someone else in this thread called it \"fanfiction\", and that&#x27;s what it is: technically very well made, but pointless fanfiction nonetheless.But if I had a slightly open mind about it, the inclusion of old Deckard, the chew-the-scenery overacting of Jared Leto (and actor that is always hard to like), and that ridiculous \"I&#x27;m the best\" Luv -- which is miles behind the marvelously inspired Roy Batty -- were the final nail (nails?) in the coffin of this trainwreck of a movie.The only saving graces are set design, K and the implications about Joi and her mass-produced but convincing displays of affection. The rest of the story is pointless and most of the characters are unlikable and badly acted.Again, no movie would have satisfied me. I think the very concept of a Blade Runner sequel is wrong and a mistake; but Hollywood must march on, I guess. reply jncfhnb 14 hours agorootparentIdk. I thought the hooker scene and the android test scene were phenomenal and interesting. If the first one asked if synthetic life could be human, this one seemed to argue that it’s arguably inevitable if the beings are living real lives; and the ultimate meaningless of the distinction. I thought that was great.I agree Ford and Leto were distractions to the detriment of the film. Would have been fine as an independent original film and not blade runner although the reflections of the original did help highlight the themes. reply the_af 13 hours agorootparentThe hooker scene did nothing for me, but the replicant alignment test was interesting. I think K was an interesting character.I do agree there were some good questions asked by the film (just not anything to do with Wallace&#x27;s \"vision\" -- boy did this ruin the movie for me!).> Would have been fine as an independent original film and not blade runnerYes. I would have received this way better had it been an original film with echoes of Blade Runner (so I would have been spared, for example, the ridiculous execution of clone-Rachael) instead of an official sequel.I can accept \"I&#x27;m a director who admires Blade Runner and want to do a film that is a homage to it\", but cannot accept \"I want to do Blade Runner 2\".For the record, I think Villeneuve is a good director and also think this was a genuine attempt at doing something good. It just happens that it was a bad idea, doomed to fail. reply idrios 10 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t believe how many people in this thread are dunking on Blade Runner 2. I thought it was phenomenal.The \"fanservicy\" stuff in this movie fits really well with the rest of its themes. It&#x27;s not like Indiana Jones 5 or Star Wars 9, where the directors are just pulling back old characters in the hopes that you&#x27;ll overlook shoddy writing because you like the characters. K is a well-developed character, without a sense of purpose, identity, or agency, caught in the crossfire of cartoonish and 1-dimensional characters who are just using him to advance their cause. The reprisal of old characters, and the eccentricity of other characters, all of it adds to the feeling that K doesn&#x27;t belong.There&#x27;s so much more that I want to say about it but I&#x27;m worried about spoiling the movie to people who haven&#x27;t seen it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone remotely interested in it. reply the_af 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t begrudge you for liking the movie, I just cannot bring myself to like it. Mostly because the movie was unnecessary, but also because of all its crappy details.I do like K and I agree with you his lack of agency and his helplessness is a plus. Gosling does a good job, too. And Joi is an interesting reflection on manufactured feelings and appealing to consumers who all think they are special.But seriously it&#x27;s hard to defend the other, cartoonish characters, who constantly ham it up to 11. Contrast, you say? Maybe.. but you cannot have a movie of bad actors (or good actors acting badly) and expect me to enjoy it.Also, Roy Batty is so much better an antagonist than Luv (or anyone else in BR2, really) that it hurts. Luv and Wallace are seriously the worst in this movie; every second of Wallace is painful to watch.Harrison Ford didn&#x27;t seem particularly inspired, either. reply nordsieck 14 hours agorootparentprevSequels are particularly tough to pull off.Aliens and Terminator 2 are beloved by fans, but most sequels seem to be either overt cash grabs, or a director trying and failing to recapture what made the first movie special.> Again, no movie would have satisfied me.

It even feels more true to his character, as the lightness of his personality and others is even more contrasted to the seriousness of the situations they face (similar thematically to old school Teen Titans perhaps), and also makes the argument that Earth influenced him for the better as a child much more compelling.The stakes are high, but goodness and strength of character prevails.

Disney bought Lucasfilm.

See the number of people who say that new star wars ruined old star wars, \"ruined their childhood\" even. How? How can a new movie ruin an old movie? Causality does not work in that direction. But some people think it does and the illogicality of their position doesn&#x27;t change the fact of how they genuinely feel. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentPeople who claim a new movie ruined their childhood are just being over-dramatic, are using it as a shorthand for it destroyed a thing from their childhood, or both.I do think, though, that sequel can make a story worse pretty easily. For example, the combined story of the Star Wars sequels, prequels, and originals is simply worse than the originals alone. When you just watched the originals, you could imagine your own Clone Wars, they could be whatever cool thing you want. Dropping neat-sounding hints and letting the audience fill in the gaps with whatever cool thing they imagine is a classic storytelling technique get a free feeling of depth. Replacing that cool thing the audience imagined with trade negotiations makes the story worse.Similarly, character arcs are a thing. The protagonists usually win and end up in a happy place, at least in a non-grimdark universe like Star Wars. Making a sequel that says: Actually Luke Skywalker spent the rest of his life failing and ended up as a miserable old grump makes his story arc worse.You can just watch the original movies and ignore the rest of course, it is after all fiction so getting the whole story doesn’t really matter. But these are huge releases that get lots of press, and I think it is unrealistic to expect fans to just ignore them. reply mcpackieh 15 hours agorootparentMaybe I&#x27;m making too much of it, perhaps it&#x27;s just the modern style to use hyperbolic rhetoric in movie reviews.But for new movies to make old movies worse used to be an uncommon attitude I think. I remember in the 90s and 00s, lots of movies had really shitty sequels, often straight to DVD, but nobody talked about these cash grabs ruining the original movie. For instance Aliens 3, Alien Resurrection and then all the AvP crap... some people like these (I think Aliens 3 is defensible FWIW) but a lot of people really don&#x27;t. Still, nobody talks about Alien or Aliens (e.g. 1 & 2) being ruined by the later movies. Aliens 3 is frequently criticized for the way it killed well-liked characters from Aliens, but that doesn&#x27;t stop people from still enjoying Aliens. People just choose to ignore Aliens 3. And why shouldn&#x27;t they, because Aliens 3 is canon? That&#x27;s just a legal IP relationship, that doesn&#x27;t matter.And Disney has dozens of straight-to-vhs&#x2F;dvd cashgrab sequels of their classic animated movies, people who don&#x27;t care for them just ignore them and they aren&#x27;t said to ruin the originals. There used to be a general understanding that sequels are very rarely good, people were pleasantly surprised when it was otherwise and nobody said their life was ruined by a bad sequel. Because who cares about cannon in animated disney movies?I&#x27;ve seen Lucas&#x27;s Clone Wars, but if I watch the original Star Wars I&#x27;m not compelled to relate it to the Clone Wars movie. By simply choosing to ignore it because I don&#x27;t like it, I free myself to imagine my own clone wars.I think new movies ruining the originals is some relatively recent cultural phenomena that was brought on by internet culture&#x27;s obsession with canon. The existence of popular sites like wookiepedia both evidence it and drive it. If I&#x27;m wrong and it&#x27;s not an overabundance of respect for IP laws that is the root of this, then why isn&#x27;t bad fanfic also said to ruin the original? reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentOf course, it is fiction, so if you want to have your own version of the story and cut off the bad parts, that’s definitely not hurting anyone.Nowadays studios really lean into the idea of establishing an expanded universe and canon, since then it becomes a recurring revenue stream and all that. So, I wonder if this is an aspect of that trend, just a different way people tell stories and, as a result, consume them.I think people ignore 90’s disney cash grab sequels mostly because they were so garbage that they didn’t get integrated into the cultural zeitgeist (and also, people who loved Lion King when it came out were too old to care about the sequel).Stuff like the Star Wars prequels is not quite at that level of badness, might be marketed toward everyone, so it enters the general conversation about the movies. Of course, it is possible to not engage in that stuff, but then, I guess people who are talking about Star Wars in 2023 are interested in the whole thing, right? You can only think about 3 movies for so long, haha. So, I bet lots of people saw them movies, have fond memories, and then moved on, but they aren’t talking about it anymore. reply lancesells 12 hours agorootparentprevI think some of the reason for the strong reaction is Star Wars is for kids while Aliens is not. There are a lot of people who were in an age of innocence when they watched Star Wars and it gets them upset if the new movies aren&#x27;t entertaining to them as adults. Even if you did watch Aliens as a kid it&#x27;s a horror movie in space with a giant bug in the shadows making it a lot less relatable. reply autoexec 18 hours agorootparentprev> How? How can a new movie ruin an old movie?I think it must be kind of like desecrating a corpse. Maybe watching someone dig up and do something prolonged and unthinkable to the body of your dead grandmother can&#x27;t undo all the lovely years you had together, but if witnessing that act enraged you, you might find that suddenly every time you see her photo or visit her grave you&#x27;re reminded of what you saw and that it upsets you all over again. reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparentNot saying I fully buy it but I think the fans’ point is that what Disney is doing to Star Wars today is diminishing the entirety of Star Wars, the average of past + present.

Fiction often involves the audience filling in the gaps: Someone drops a hint that characters have known each other a long time; you can imagine that as you’d like. In the end, you get “and they lived happily ever after,” you decide what “happily ever after” looks like.Sequels and prequels need to add more drama and action, so happily ever after never ends up being all that happy. reply ndsipa_pomu 15 hours agorootparentprevAndor is well worth a watch though reply mcphage 17 hours agorootparentprev> I think the fans’ point is that what Disney is doing to Star Wars today is diminishing the entirety of Star WarsThey may believe that, but it&#x27;s not true. reply omoikane 16 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it&#x27;s because they re-released modified versions of the original Star Wars trilogy[1].

He&#x27;s not objecting to horror or disgusting things per se, but pointing out there&#x27;s no point without the humanist part as well. Their project is ultimately artless, regardless of topic, and they pick this to show him because they&#x27;re too dumb to see that in the first place.

Your linked video clearly shows what he was looking at -- how is that remotely similar to anything like Dall-E or Midjourney? Miyazaki would love Stable Diffusion.

It gets me worked up. reply EatingWithForks 18 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstand the joy and pride that is an animator, which is in the nuances of the actual creation process which Stable Diffusion removes. We can also compare this to western shows like Arcane, where despite 3d modeling the shading and lighting was done by hand, to immense pride of the animators.The problem with AI has been always that it removes from the artist the act the artist finds joy in, the work to create a beautiful final product, and leaves only the most boring and meh parts: contract negotiation, right fights, pay and attribution concerns, etc. reply nemothekid 19 hours agorootparentprev>Miyazaki would love Stable DiffusionNot sure how you could confidently say this.

Miyazaki did not say \"I love this tech but it doesn&#x27;t look good enough yet.\"He actually doesn&#x27;t comment on the quality of the animation at all. His comments are entirely focused on how he feels the technique lacks a human-ness that he thinks is important to art. An early effort you would like to see improved does not \"disgust\" you or make you feel the creators are \"insult[ing] life itself.\"Of course he could change his mind, but if you don&#x27;t think his comments reflect a belief at that moment in time about machines creating art, I do not believe you&#x27;ve understood what he is saying. reply whymauri 19 hours agorootparentprev>Miyazaki would love Stable Diffusion.You don&#x27;t know that. reply bitwize 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve felt the same way about Gainax, from whom all the good original people departed, forming splinter studios while Gainax&#x27;s \"loose management\" ran it into the ground.

I recently accidentally watched Castle In the Sky with the English dub and I was so angry at the terrible changes they made to the sound design.The opening scene in the Japanese version is completely quiet except for the sound of engines running, and in the English dub they just added crappy music over the whole thing. In the Japanese version they break the silence with this really startling piano&#x2F;electronic track. In the English dub they fade it in.I don’t know who was responsible for that but there’s nothing I hate more than someone ruining something good for literally no reason. reply autoexec 16 hours agoparentEnglish dubs are usually terrible in general. I&#x27;d mind them a bit less if they were just faithful translations using different voice actors, but so often they dumb the scripts down and add a bunch of other changes as if no one in the English speaking world could appreciate it otherwise.It can make a huge difference. One example of this is the animated Canadian&#x2F;French film \"Ballerina\" which got good reviews. The Weinstein Company got the rights to distribute it in the US and they butchered the script adding a bunch of bad jokes everywhere and making unnecessary changes and the resulting film \"Leap!\" got terrible reviews. reply JeremyNT 14 hours agorootparent> English dubs are usually terrible in general.

They aren&#x27;t perfect, but increased awareness of Miyazaki in the west (and from Disney no less) meant that it was worth spending the money to do them well. In general they have good writers and voice actors, and demonstrate a respect for the source material.The earlier Miyazaki stuff, before he was as well known here (like Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind or Laputa: Castle in the Sky) ... well... not so much (I do think Nausicaä was eventually redubbed, though I&#x27;m not sure how good it was). reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard to complain too much when you&#x27;ve got someone like Neil Gaiman rewriting the script.

I always find it odd when people prefer a sub to a dub. Only in edge cases where the dub is absolutely terrible would I ever consider this for an animated work. In movies, sometimes the mouth moving is distracting but for animation this is not a problem. For the 2 nits you picked above, I don&#x27;t think I would watch 90 minutes in a foreign language. Is this a preference or something? To be clear, I am genuinely curious about why people prefer subs reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparentThe voice acting is almost always vastly better in the original language. The creator of the work spent significant time and money finding the right person for each role and then spent even more time working with them to get the performance they want in every scene. This is especially true in Japan since voice actors are more of a big deal there than in the US. For the dub, that kind of care isn&#x27;t usually put into it, and even when the company producing the dub does put some effort into it that only reflects their desires, not those of the original creator.That&#x27;s why you so often get a very recognizable (and annoying imho) \"anime dub voice\". It sounds extremely unnatural. I can often tell if something has been dubbed from its original language just by hearing a few spoken lines of dialog! That shouldn&#x27;t be possible, but it&#x27;s obvious.The other main problem I have with dubs is that they are not faithful to the content of the original work. Sometimes they rewrite parts of the script to avoid mouths not matching up with English voices, or to limit the amount of work needed to edit the mouths to match. Sometimes they rewrite the script entirely!They also tend to make all kinds of totally needless changes. They&#x27;ll often censor content and dumb down the script (typically by over-explaining everything). They almost always make changes to localize it by removing&#x2F;replacing cultural references. One of the things I enjoy about consuming media made in other countries is that I get to learn things about those cultures. I like to see artistic works that come from a non-US perspective. I don&#x27;t want that stripped away.If you&#x27;re looking at art made in another language, the ideal situation would be to have mastery of the language it was written&#x2F;performed in, and that you&#x27;d have all the cultural knowledge to fully appreciate the many careful and deliberate choices the creator made. Most of the time, that&#x27;s just not possible. Translation itself is a lossy process. It means that for you to enjoy it at all, you have to accept that some things are lost. The goal then, should be to retain as much of the original work as possible. That means subtitles and original voice acting. If you watch a dub you are not getting the work the creators envisioned and labored to bring into the world. You&#x27;re getting something very different and much farther removed. reply projectazorian 14 hours agorootparent> They also tend to make all kinds of totally needless changes. They&#x27;ll often censor content and dumb down the script (typically by over-explaining everything).Excellent example of this is the Ghost in the Shell 4K remaster, which has all new subtitles that are a much more faithful translation of the original work - but you wouldn’t know that if you watched the dub, which wasn’t changed at all. reply robswc 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m the same way. I love subtitles _but_ they degrade some of the experience. I had to turn them off because they will spoil the moment. Good example is King of The Hill.

It might not have even been anime, but the subtitles had blanks in them, until it was time to reveal the word, when that key word would appear.In this way, they didn&#x27;t spoil the punchline, or who was being talked to. It was a little bit jarring the first time, but by the second time it happened, I had already adapted and was thankful for it. reply autoexec 14 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;ll see the punchline before the delivery and I feel like it spoils the scene&#x2F;joke.This I&#x27;ll agree is a major problem with subtitles. It&#x27;s not even just the jokes. I&#x27;ve seen the names of characters shown in subtitles (because they were speaking off screen) long before that character&#x27;s name was revealed to the audience by the script.Another major distraction is the trend companies have these days to refuse to provide subtitles and give only closed captioning with all of its extraneous information about sound effects or the highly subjective descriptions of whatever music is playing. It&#x27;s so obnoxious. reply projectazorian 14 hours agorootparentprev> Are you fluent in Japanese? I always find it odd when people prefer a sub to a dub.You don’t need to be fluent in Japanese to notice a lot of context that (by necessity) gets left out in a dub. How characters address one another, for example. Also, if you’re trying to learn Japanese then the more Japanese you hear, the better - even if you don’t understand it all.Not to mention the usual arguments about the original voice acting being a better reflection of the authors’ intent, etc.I’ll still watch dubs if I don’t want to give something my undivided attention, though. reply kouru225 5 hours agorootparentprevI’d be fine with a dub if they kept the same sound design, but sound design is way more important than dialogue imo. Yea I’ll definitely watch with subs. I got absolutely no fear about that for a foreign movie. For an English movie though I gotta take subs off unless my gf demands them (I dunno why she likes them so much)I used to speak Japanese but I can’t rely on it at all for movies. I’ve forgotten most of it. reply midoridensha 54 minutes agorootparent>For an English movie though I gotta take subs off unless my gf demands them (I dunno why she likes them so much)Maybe for the same reason me and countless other native English speakers do: because everyone mumbles so much in movies these days. It&#x27;s impossible to understand actors now. This isn&#x27;t a problem when watching older movies. reply otachack 16 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s having a general preference over the \"original\" material. Subs do force you to read and watch so you need to initially train yourself to deal with it, but now I always prefer subs even with my native language because voice volume can vary between media.Adding dubs lays another layer onto the original artists vision, such as Ghibli with Disney-produced dubs on top. Some will hit right, others won&#x27;t. Subs are definitely another layer as now you need translators but it&#x27;s a lighter one than dubs.I personally don&#x27;t knock people who do dubs vs. subs. I grew up watching Bruce Lee movies with terrible English dubs and loved them, still.Hope that makes sense! reply goosedragons 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy? It&#x27;s the original intent and the original voice. The sub tends to be closer to the original script because they aren&#x27;t constrained by mouths moving nor can they add lines, music etc. I don&#x27;t think voice acting is as well respected in North America too and so lack of talent&#x2F;desire to keep costs low gets a worse result. I don&#x27;t think it helps that English VAs will sometimes try to mimic the Japanese VAs but it just doesn&#x27;t work and easily sounds really grating.

    "originBody": "Spec About Blog Documentation Ecosystem Podcasts Shop Try Matrix Matrix 2.0: The Future of Matrix 21.09.2023 15:30 — General — Matthew Hodgson TL;DR: If you want to play with a shiny new Matrix 2.0 client, head over to Element X. Matrix has been going for over 9 years now, providing an open standard for secure, decentralised communication for the open Web - and it’s been quite the journey to get to where we are today. Right now, according to Synapse’s opt-in usage reporting, in total there are 111,873,374 matrix IDs on the public network, spanning 17,289,201 rooms, spread over 64,256 servers. This is just scratching the surface, given we estimate that 66% of servers in the public network don’t report stats, and there are many enormous private networks of servers too. We’ve come a long way from creating Matrix HQ as the first ever room on today’s public network, back on Aug 13th 2014 :) Meanwhile, the Matrix ecosystem has continued to grow unbelievably - with huge numbers of independent clients, bots and bridges maturing into ecosystems of their own, whole new companies forming around the protocol, and organisations ranging from open source projects to governments, NGOs and Fortune 100 companies adopting Matrix as a way to run their own secure, decentralised, standards-based self-sovereign communication. The world needs Matrix more than ever. Every day the importance of decentralisation is more painfully obvious, as we concretely see the terrifying risks of centralised Internet services - whether that’s through corporate takeover, state censorship, blanket surveillance, Internet shutdowns, surveillance capitalism, or the spectre of gigantic centralised data breaches. It’s been amazing to see the world pivot in favour of decentralisation over the time we’ve been building Matrix, and our mission has never been more important. On one hand it feels we’re creeping ever closer to that goal of providing the missing communication layer for the open Web. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a huge step in that direction - regulation that mandates that if the large centralised messaging providers are to operate in the EU, they must interoperate. We’ve been busy working away to make this a reality, including participating in the IETF for the first time as part of the MIMI working group - demonstrating concretely how (for instance) Android Messages could natively speak Matrix in order to interoperate with other services, while preserving end-to-end encryption. On the other hand, Matrix has often got stuck in focusing on solving the Hard Problems of decentralisation, decentralised end-to-end encryption, and the logistical complexities of supporting a massive heterogeneous public communication network and its surrounding heterogeneous ecosystem. It’s fair to say that in the early days our focus was on making something that worked at all - and then later, we shifted to focusing on something that worked and scaled correctly… but we hadn’t managed to focus on ensuring that Matrix provides the building blocks necessary to create blazingly fast, hyper-efficient communication apps which has potential to outperform the centralised mainstream messaging services… …until now! Matrix 2.0 Back at FOSDEM we announced the idea of Matrix 2.0 - a series of huge step changes in terms of Matrix’s usability and performance, made up of Sliding Sync (instant login/launch/sync), Native OIDC (industry-standard authentication), Native Group VoIP (end-to-end encrypted large-scale voice & video conferencing) and Faster Joins (lazy-loading room state when your server joins a room). Now, we’re excited to announce that as of today everyone can start playing with these Matrix 2.0 features. There’s still some work to bring them formally into the specification, but we’re putting it out there for folks to experience right now. Developers: watch this space for updates on the spec front. Practically speaking, this means there are now implementations of the four pillars of Matrix 2.0 available today which you can use to power a daily-driver Matrix 2.0 client. The work here has been driven primarily by Element, using their new Element X client as the test-bed for the new Matrix 2.0 functionality and to prove that the new APIs are informed by real-world usage and can concretely demonstrably create an app which begins to outperform iMessage, WhatsApp and Telegram in terms of usability and performance… all while benefiting from being 100% built on Matrix. matrix-rust-sdk and Element X The mission of Matrix 2.0 has been to provide a huge step forwards in real-world performance, usability and stability - and that means using a real client codebase as a guinea pig to ensure the new protocol is fit for purpose. matrix-rust-sdk has been the main vehicle for this, with Element X as the app primarily driving the new features (although other clients built on matrix-rust-sdk such as Fractal 5 can then automatically benefit from the work should they wish). To see what all the fuss is about, your best bet is probably to head over to the Element X launch blog post and read all about it! But from the Matrix perspective, this is a flag day in terms of the existence of a Matrix client which empirically outperforms the mainstream clients both in terms of usability and performance: it shows that Matrix is indeed viable to power communication for billions of users, should we get the chance. From a client perspective: this has meant implementing Sliding Sync (MSC3575) in matrix-rust-sdk - and then creating the entirely new matrix-sdk-ui crate in order to expose higher level APIs to help apps efficiently drive their UI, without each app having to keep reinventing the wheel and risking getting it wrong. The new UI crate gives APIs for efficiently managing a lazy-loaded room list, lazy-loaded room timelines (including edits, reactions, aggregations, redactions etc), and even when the app should show a sync spinner or not. As a result, the vast majority of the heavy lifting can be handled in matrix-rust-sdk, ensuring that the app layer can focus on UI rather than Matrix guts - and performance improvements (e.g. roomlist caching and timeline caching) can all be handled in one place to the benefit of all clients using the SDK. This is a huge breakthrough relative to the old days of Matrix where each client would have no choice but burn significant amounts of time hand-carving its own timeline and encryption glue logic (although of course clients are still very welcome to do so if they wish!) - but for those wanting higher-level building building blocks, matrix-rust-sdk now provides an excellent basis for experimenting with Matrix 2.0 clients. It’s worth noting that the library is still evolving fast, though, and many APIs are not long-term stable. Both the Sliding Sync API and the UI crates are still subject to significant change, and while the crypto crate and its underlying vodozemac E2EE implementation is pretty stable, features such as E2EE Backup are still being added to the top-level matrix-rust-sdk (and thence Element X). In order to hook matrix-rust-sdk up to Element X, the Element team ended up contributing cancellable async bindings to uniffi, Mozilla’s language binding generator, so you can now call matrix-rust-sdk directly from Swift, Kotlin and (in theory) other languages, complete with beautifully simple async/await non-blocking semantics. This looks to be a pretty awesome stack for doing modern cross-platform development - so even if you have a project which isn’t natively in Rust, you should be able to lean on matrix-rust-sdk if you so desire! We hope that other projects will follow the Rust + Swift/Kotlin pattern for their extreme performance needs :) Sliding Sync The single biggest change in Matrix 2.0 is the proposal of an entirely new sync API called Sliding Sync (MSC3575). The goal of Sliding Sync is to ensure that the application has the option of loading the absolutely bare essential data required to render its visible user interface - ensuring that operations which have historically been horribly slow in Matrix (login and initial sync, launch and incremental sync) are instant, no matter how many rooms the user is in or how large those rooms are. While matrix-rust-sdk implements both Sync v2 (the current API in Matrix 1.8) as well as Sliding Sync, Element X deliberately only implements Sliding Sync, in order to focus exclusively on getting the fastest UI possible (and generally to exercise the API). Therefore to use Element X, you need to be running a homeserver with Sliding Sync support, which (for now) means running a sliding-sync proxy which bolts Sliding Sync support on to existing homeservers. You can check out Thib’s excellent tutorial for how to get up and running (or Element Server Suite provides packages from the Element team) Now, implementing Sliding Sync in matrix-rust-sdk has been a bit of a journey. Since we showed off the very first implementation at FOSDEM, two big problems came to light. For a bit of context: the original design of Sliding Sync was heavily inspired by Discord’s architecture - where the server calculates an ordered list of large numbers of items (your room list, in Matrix’s case); the client says which window into the list it’s currently displaying; and the server sends updates to the client as the view changes. The user then scrolls around that list, sliding the window up and down, and the server sends the appropriate updates - hence the name Sliding Sync. Sliding Sync was originally driven by our work on Low Bandwidth Matrix - as it makes no sense to have a fancy line protocol which can run over a 2400 baud modem… if the first thing the app tries to do is download a 100MB Sync v2 initial-sync response, or for that matter a 10MB incremental-sync response after having been offline for a few days (10MB takes 9 hours to shift over a 2400 baud modem, for those who missed out on the 80s). Instead, you clearly only want to send the absolute essentials to the client, no matter how big their account is, and that’s what Sliding Sync does. The first minor flaw in the plan, however, is that the server doesn’t necessarily have all the data it needs to order the room list. Room ordering depends on what the most recent visible events are in a room, and if the room’s end-to-end encrypted, the server has no way of knowing which events are going to be visible for a given client or not. It also doesn’t know which rooms have encrypted mentions inside them, and we don’t want to leak mention metadata to the server, or design out keyword mentions. So, MSC3575 proposed some complicated contortions to let the client tweak the order client-side based on its superior knowledge of the ordering (given most clients would need to sync all the encrypted rooms anyway, in order to index them and search for keyword notifications etc). Meanwhile, the order might be ‘good enough’ even without those tweaks. The second minor flaw in the plan was that having implemented Sliding Sync in Element X, it turns out that the user experience on mobile of incrementally loading in room list entries from the server as the user scrolls around the list is simply not good enough, especially on bad connectivity - and the last thing we want to do is to design out support for bad connectivity in Matrix. Users have been trained on mobile to expect to be able to swipe rapidly through infinite-scrolling lists of tens of thousands of photos in their photo gallery, or tens of thousands of emails in their mail client, without ever seeing a single placeholder, even for a frame. So if the network roundtrip time to your server is even 100ms, and Sliding Sync is operating infinitely quickly, you’re still going to end up showing a placeholders for a few frames (6 frames, at 60fps, to be precise) if the user starts scrolling rapidly through their room list. And empirically that doesn’t look great - the 2007-vintage iOS team have a lot to answer for in terms of setting user expectations! So, the obvious way to solve both of these problems is simply to pull in more data in the background, to anticipate the user scrolling around. In fact, it turns out we need to do that anyway, and indeed pull in all the room data so that room-search is instantly responsive; waiting 100ms or more to talk to the server whenever the user tries to search their roomlist is no fun at all, and it transpires that many users navigate their roomlist entirely by search rather than scrolling. As a result, the sliding sync implementation in matrix-rust-sdk has ended up maintaining an ‘all rooms’ list, which starts off syncing the roomlist details for the most recent N rooms, and then in the background expands to sync all the rest. At which point we’re not really sliding a window around any more: instead it’s more of a QoSed incremental sync. So, to cut a long story short: while the current Sliding Sync implementation in matrix-rust-sdk and Element X empirically works very well, it’s ended up being a bit too complicated and we expect some pretty significant simplifications in the near future based on the best practices figured out with clients using it. Watch this space for updates, although it’s likely that the current form of MSC3575 will prevail in some respect in order to support low-bandwidth environments where roomlist ordering and roomsearch latency is less important than preserving bandwidth. Critically, we want to figure this out before we encourage folks to implement native server implementations - so for now, we’ll be keeping using the sliding-sync proxy as a way to rapidly experiment with the API as it evolves. Native Matrix Group VoIP Another pillar of Matrix 2.0 is that we finally have native Matrix Group VoIP calling (MSC3401)! Much like Sliding Sync has been developed using Element X as a testbed, Element Call has been the guinea pig for getting fully end-to-end-encrypted, scalable group voice/video calling implemented on top of Matrix, building on top of matrix-js-sdk. And as of today, Element Call finally has it working, complete with end-to-end encryption (and integrated in Element X, for that matter)! Much like Sliding Sync, this has also been a bit of a journey. The original implementations of Element Call strictly followed MSC3401, using full mesh conferencing to effectively have every participant place a call to every other participant - thus decentralising the conference and avoiding the need for a conferencing ‘focus’ server… but limiting the conference to 7 or 8 participants given all the duplication of the sent video required. In Element Call Beta 2, end-to-end encryption was enabled; easy, given it’s just a set of 1:1 calls. Then the real adventure began: to implement a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) which can be used to scale up to hundreds of users - or beyond. The unexpected first move came from Sean DuBois, project lead of the awesome Pion WebRTC stack for Golang - who wrote a proof-of-concept called sfu-to-sfu to demonstrate the viability of decentralised heterogenous cascading SFUs, as detailed in MSC3898. This would not only let calls on a single focus scale beyond hundreds of users, but also share the conferencing out across all the participating foci, providing the world’s first heterogeneous decentralised video conferencing. Element took the sfu-to-sfu implementation, hooked it up to Element Call on a branch, and renamed it as waterfall. However, when Sean first contributed sfu-to-sfu, he mentioned to us that if Matrix is serious about SFUs, we should take a look at LiveKit - an open source startup not dissimilar to Element who were busy building best-in-class SFUs on top of Pion. And while waterfall worked well as a proof of concept, it became increasingly obvious that there’s a lot of work to be done around tuning congestion control, error correction, implementing end-to-end encryption etc which the LiveKit team had already spent years doing. So, Element reached out to the LiveKit team, and started experimenting with what it might take to implement a Matrix-capable SFU on top of the LiveKit engine. The end result was Element Call Beta 3, which is an interesting hybrid between MSC3401 and LiveKit’s existing signalling: the high-level signalling of the call (its existence, membership, duration etc) is advertised by Matrix - but the actual WebRTC signalling is handled by LiveKit, providing support for hundreds of users per call. Finally, today marks the release of Element Call Beta 4, which adds back end-to-end encryption via the LiveKit SFU (currently by using a shared static secret, but in the near future will support full Matrix-negotiated end-to-end encryption with sender keys) - and also includes a complete visual refresh. The next steps here include bringing back support for full mesh as well as SFU, for environments without an SFU, and updating all the MSCs to recognise the hybrid signalling model that reality has converged on when using LiveKit. Meanwhile, head over to https://call.element.io to give it a go, or read more about it in the Element X Ignition blog post! Native Open ID Connect Finally, last but not least, we’re proud to announce that the project to replace Matrix’s venerable existing authentication APIs with industry-standard Open ID Connect in Matrix 2.0 has taken a huge leap forwards today, with matrix-authentication-service now being available to add Native OIDC support to Synapse, as well as Element X now implementing account registration, login and management via Native OIDC (with legacy support only for login/logout). This is a critical step forwards in improving the security and maintainability for Matrix’s authentication, and you can read all about it in this dedicated post, explaining the rationale for adopting OpenID Connect for all forms of authentication throughout Matrix, and what you need to know about the transition. Conclusion There has been an enormous amount of work that has gone into Matrix 2.0 so far - whether that’s implementing sliding sync in matrix-rust-sdk and sliding-sync proxy, matrix-authentication-service and all the native OIDC infrastructure on servers and clients, the entirety of Element Call and its underpinning matrix-js-sdk and SFU work, or indeed Faster Joins in Synapse, which shipped back in Jan. It’s been a pretty stressful sprint to pull it all together, and huge thanks go to everyone who’s contributed - both from the team at Element, but also contributors to other projects like matrix-rust-sdk who have got caught in the crossfire :) It’s also been amazing seeing the level of support, high quality testing and excellent feedback from the wider community as folks have got excited about the promise of Matrix 2.0. On the Foundation side, we’d like to thank the Members whose financial support has been critical in providing bandwidth to enable the progress on Matrix 2.0 - and for those who want to help accelerate Matrix, especially those commercially building on top of Matrix, please consider joining the Foundation as a member! Also, in case you missed it, we’re super excited to welcome Josh Simmons as Managing Director for the Foundation - focusing on running the Foundation membership programme and generally ensuring the growth of the Foundation funding for the benefit of the whole Matrix community. Matthew and Amandine continue to lead the overall project (alongside their day jobs at Element), with the support of the other three independent Guardians - but Josh is working full time exclusively on running the non-profit foundation and gathering funds to support Matrix. Talking of funding, we should mention that we’ve had to pause work in other places due to lack of Matrix funding - especially while focusing on successfully shipping Matrix 2.0. Major next-generation projects including Third Room, P2P Matrix, and Low Bandwidth Matrix have all been paused unless there’s a major shift in circumstances - so, if you have money and you’re interested in a world where the more experimental next-generation Matrix projects progress with folks working on them as their day job, please get in touch with the Foundation. What’s next? While this is the first usable release of Matrix 2.0 implementations, there’s loads of work still to be done - obvious work on Matrix 2.0 includes: Getting Native OIDC enabled on matrix.org, and providing migration tools to Native OIDC for existing homeservers in general Reworking Sliding Sync based on the lessons learned implementing it in matrix-rust-sdk Actually getting the Matrix 2.0 MSCs stabilised and matured to the point they can be approved and merged into the spec Adding encrypted backups to matrix-rust-sdk Reintroducing full-mesh support for Native Matrix Group VoIP calling Having a big Matrix 2.0 launch party once the spec lands! Outside of Matrix 2.0 work, other big items on the horizon include: Adding Rust matrix-sdk-crypto to matrix-js-sdk, at which point all the official Matrix.org client SDKs will (at last!) be using the same stable performant E2EE implementation Continuing to contribute Matrix input to the MIMI working group in IETF for Digital Markets Act interoperability Working on MLS for next-generation E2EE Next generation moderation tooling and capabilities Account Portability and Multihomed accounts …and much much more. So: welcome to our brave new Matrix 2.0 world. We hope you’re excited about it as we are - and thanks to everyone for continuing to use Matrix and build on it. Here’s to the beginning of a whole new era! Matthew, Amandine and the whole Matrix team.

However, should we hold off on putting it in people&#x27;s hands while we sort that? Nope. Is it a pain to temporarily run a proxy shim service while the protocol stabilises? Yes. It&#x27;s like running a SPDY or QUIC-aware reverse proxy in front of a webapp that only speaks HTTP&#x2F;1.1 while waiting for SPDY to be ratified as HTTP&#x2F;2. Sure, it&#x27;s another moving part to look after, but the spectacular improvement is likely worth the pain.

Glad it was fairly straightforward. reply the_common_man 16 hours agoparentprevWhy is sliding sync a separate service and not just part of synapse itself? reply Arathorn 16 hours agorootparentBecause the API is still evolving, and it&#x27;s also useful that it supports other homeservers than Synapse. It&#x27;s also written by an entirely different bunch of people (it&#x27;s effectively written by the Dendrite team rather than the Synapse team).Once the API is stable I&#x27;m sure all the homeservers will implement it natively. Until then, think of it like a reverse-proxy that lets an HTTP&#x2F;1 webapp talk HTTP&#x2F;2 to the outside world. reply acheong08 15 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s effectively written by the Dendrite team rather than the Synapse teamI would then ask why it isn’t integrated into Dendrite reply Arathorn 14 hours agorootparent...because then Synapse wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it? reply infinitezest 16 hours agorootparentprevI would guess it&#x27;s so the same functionality can be used with other Matrix servers without having to rewrite the whole thing reply UltimateEdge 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s currently still a proposal to the spec, and it is not yet part of the Matrix protocol. reply the_gipsy 16 hours agoparentprevWell you can just wait.

No complaints so far, although we didn&#x27;t use Discord&#x27;s voice&#x2F;video&#x2F;screen-sharing features (which I hear that Matrix intends to support eventually).UX-wise, it made me appreciate the distinction between Discord&#x27;s \"everyone is subscribed to every channel in a server by default\" stance, and IRC&#x2F;Matrix&#x27;s opposite approach. The latter certainly scales better, but the former is so, so much better for discoverability, so it&#x27;s probably the better default for small servers.And if you&#x27;re looking for a Matrix client with a Discord-like UI, try Cinny. reply Arathorn 15 hours agoparentThe plan on Discord-style voice&#x2F;video&#x2F;screensharing features is Element Call (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;call.element.io) which is built to be embeddable into Matrix clients.

Agreed we should have fixed this years ago, especially as it&#x27;s actually a feature in our pre-Matrix system back in 2012.

I am increasingly disappointed with how centralized Matrix is becoming, since AFAIK there isn&#x27;t really an alternate client close to the same level of quality as Element.I probably would&#x27;ve made all of the same decisions myself though, so I don&#x27;t blame them I&#x27;m just a bit disappointed in how it&#x27;s shaking out. reply panick21_ 16 hours agorootparentYou just can&#x27;t have the newest fancy client without also having the new fancy server.

For instance, my account is in around 4,000 chatrooms, and Element iOS was taking ~10s to launch and sync, and could easily take minutes to sync in the morning (heaven forbid the app was offline for more than overnight). Meanwhile, Element X launches in around 100ms, no matter how long it&#x27;s been offline, and syncs in around a second.The model that we&#x27;re going for is similar to iOS or macOS: something which is incredibly simple for normal users, but can also scale up seamlessly for crazy powerusers.In terms of specific poweruser features: I suspect the strategy will be to see if we can provide the same end result without actually adding the feature - and failing that, add the feature very strategically via progressive disclosure... or perhaps not at all, and rely on other Matrix apps to pick it up.The intention is to fairly rapidly replace regular Element on mobile with Element X, eitherway. reply lousken 14 hours agorootparentOk, I understand... one last thing I ask every year - custom emojis when? :)And thank you for your the hard work! reply Arathorn 14 hours agorootparentBut we just entirely rewrote both mobile clients to get out of having to implement custom emojis! :D Joking aside, it&#x27;s easily one of the biggest features missing from Element&#x2F;Element X, and I for one can&#x27;t wait for it to land.

For example, you should be able to get all the same functionality with Element, Fluffychat, Thunderbird, and other user agents, and with any home server, both now and on an ongoing basis. And the user agent implementation difficulty should become tractable enough, in terms of size&complexity and specification, that one person could write a new one -- not like Web browsers have become, where there&#x27;s mainly only one, that company has been funding the runner-up, and that company can pretty much dictate &#x27;standards&#x27;.) reply Arathorn 16 hours agoparentMatrix 2.0 is a major step towards getting friends & family on Matrix.Firstly, it&#x27;s not introducing new features - it&#x27;s just making the current featureset work super-efficiently (while retaining compatibility with today&#x27;s Matrix). So there should be no fragmentation between Element&#x2F;Fluffychat&#x2F;Thunderbird, with the possible exception of the new scalable encrypted VoIP conferencing (but then very few Matrix clients implemented the old VoIP conferencing, plus you can always just embed an Element Call instance to get at it now - as Element X does today).Secondly, we&#x27;re explicitly working to protect Matrix from the commercial interests from Element (the company set up by the team who created Matrix, of which I&#x27;m ceo&#x2F;cto as well as Matrix project lead). We already have The Matrix.org Foundation (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;foundation) as an independent non-profit to hold the Matrix IP and maintain its neutrality - but we also just hired Josh Simmons (former President of the OSI) as its independent Managing Director (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;introducing-josh-simmons-man...).So: going forwards, the Foundation increasingly does not have to depend on Element not being evil, but instead has its own independent management to ensure the protocol exists to support everyone in the ecosystem, without fragmentation, as per the guiding principles at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;foundation - under its own autonomy.I&#x27;d say this is is good news for libre software privacy & security type people, but then again I&#x27;m biased. Practically, the only thing getting in the way of getting friends & family on Matrix is that Element X requires fancy OIDC-native homeservers for registration, so newbies won&#x27;t be able to use Element X to join Matrix yet. But the app itself should be an excellent way to get folks on board in the very near future. reply em-bee 16 hours agorootparentelement still has serious usability issues that need to be fixed before i can get friends or family on board.the way threads are displayed in the browser versions makes them hard to follow. in our hackerspace, where many are tech minded people, i see regular complaints about that.scrollback to unread messages often fails. i have never had another chat application where that was a problem. this should just work.the handling of encryption keys is very confusing. there are to many moving parts, it&#x27;s not clear what i must save so that i can restore the keys in a new client.private rooms are also confusing. i want to have a private room be the name of my chat partner, and they want it to carry my name. being able to do that would be very helpful.i am also missing the ability to use a different nickname in every room. different groups know me under different nicknames. discord and wechat can do it. it would be great if matrix&#x2F;element could do that too. reply Arathorn 15 hours agorootparentSounds like you’re talking about Element Web or Desktop here.

I used Matrix with a non-technical family member for about six months before giving up and going back to SMS because she frequently got messages about encryption that she was in no way equipped to deal with, and did not even begin to understand (yes, the \"user-friendly\" key fingerprint screen is one of those pain points) and I had to handhold her through the process, every time she got a new device or similar.One time I had to manually export and import my own keys to be able to read old messages, which was a task that would have been too technical for most of the people I&#x27;d like to chat with, and was supremely annoying for me.It&#x27;s just a non-starter. I have a community I&#x27;ve been considering moving to Matrix for literal _years_ now and there are just so many sharp edges.I&#x27;ve been confused about Matrix&#x27;s priorities for a long, long time. I am not getting any less confused, to be honest. reply Arathorn 11 hours agorootparentWell, just as folks might be skeptical about Matrix clients ever being as performant as WhatsApp&#x2F;iMessage&#x2F;Telegram, and yet we eventually got there with Element X... I&#x27;m expecting a similar outcome with E2EE UX.The high level plan is:* Fix all the bugs which cause random undecryptable messages, which was the main thing causing frustration. This is (hopefully) done now by converging on the new Rust implementation.* Generate a recovery key, rather than confuse the user by asking them to pick two passwords (one for their account, one for their encryption). Impress on the user that if they ever want to recover their history, they&#x27;ll need it. Expect that most users will lose it.* When logging in on a new device, scan a QR code on an existing device to transfer over the keys (and thus history). Users are used to this now thanks to WhatsApp and Discord, and empirically they can do it fine. The recovery key is used only as a worst-case scenario if the user has no other devices. The act of logging in (either via scanning another device, or via recovery key) signs that device as owned by you.* Only accept messages from devices that a given user has signed (i.e. trust on first use for users). If you want to verify that user out of band, they get an green tick too, purely to help you keep track of which users you&#x27;re sure are legit and which users you&#x27;ve assumed are legit.* At any given point, encryption is either enabled on your device (i.e. you&#x27;ve signed that device; it can access your encrypted message history; it can store keys for your encrypted message history) or it&#x27;s not (and you can&#x27;t do any E2EE). There are no halfway states.This may sound simple and obvious when written out like this, but each point is a major change from the supremely confusing system we have today. The thing stopping us from having implemented it sooner is the huge amount of effort which went into reimplementing the engine in Rust. But having now (almost) finished that project, next thing up is fixing the UX, at last.

Hopefully others will spin up independent implementations rapidly - although right now it does introduce a potential commercial EEE situation… but from on LiveKit rather than Element.Eitherway, it’s something we’re painfully aware of… while also trying to ensure we find enough $ to pay for dev on Matrix (and Element) otherwise the whole thing collapses. reply sneak 15 hours agoparentprevOne of the big problems as I see it is that all notifications on iOS must be proxied via APNS and those can only be sent by the app publisher, so all home servers must send their iOS notifications to Vector (the Element publishers) to be sent to APNS and on to an iPhone or iPad.This is a centralized point for surveillance of metadata. I also do not know how much information is actually contained in the notification itself. In any case Vector has knowledge of every home server with an iOS client, and their approximate traffic levels. reply Aerbil313 13 hours agorootparentThen everyone should just roll out their own app… this seems like an EU-regulation-needed situation. reply sneak 13 hours agorootparentThis requires paying about $10&#x2F;month to Apple and doxxing yourself with a lot of PII.It also requires that you as a homeserver sysadmin a) have a Mac, b) install Xcode, c) know how to modify and compile iOS applications, d) want to deal with rebuilding and reuploading and re-seeking app approval on major API changes because long-un-updated apps are not allowed in the App Store, etc... reply inhumantsar 10 hours agorootparentSecurity, Convenience, and Speed will always be in constant tension.If you start by assuming that a perfect solution will always be unattainable, deciding on what tradeoffs are acceptable becomes easier.Imho it almost always going to be worth trading the large PITA of self-managing APNS infra for the small surface area that routing push notifications through Elements systems. reply sneak 9 hours agorootparentThis comment makes it seem like Apple&#x27;s anticompetitive stance on sideloading is a basic force of nature instead of something dreamed up by control freak hippies and implemented deliberately in code.The problem is iOS&#x27;s privacy-hostile design (in service of their locked down revenue model), not some unbreakable iron triangle.On Android, messaging apps can run in the background and periodically talk to their homeserver without an intermediary. replykevincox 15 hours agoparentprevFWIW my partner and mother are using it.

Same as it ever was. reply Arathorn 3 hours agorootparentThe reason for Riot->RiotX (aka Element) on Android was to both move to a modern Android UI idiom, move to Kotlin, and have a well defined storage interface and switch to Rx patterns, whereas the original app had been built somewhat organically. And yes, the maintainer had changed.The reason for Element -> Element X is in order to share precisely the same Rust SDK between iOS and Android (and maybe other platforms in future), so all the heavylifting happens in one single audited codebase, rather than doubling up all the development between iOS and Android, doubling the bug count, etc. It’s also a good opportunity to simplify the data flows, which are surprisingly subtle and performant in a messaging app; I’m not sure how much Rx remains. In this instance, the maintaining team remained the same. reply wkat4242 13 hours agorootparentprevAh ok no I don&#x27;t have a Mac, I use FreeBSD :)And thanks I&#x27;ll try that out!!

It deals with transmission of messages between two peers. Just like with SMTP, you can federate servers, so they can exchange messages between each other.And the similarities don&#x27;t end here. XMPP doesn&#x27;t have built-in support for encryption (apart from the basic TLS encryption for the transport layer), it doesn&#x27;t have support for message archiving and chat history syncing, there is no support for group chats, and so on.A lot of this functionality is added as extensions (e.g. group chats are XEP-045), but this simply caused a lot of fragmentation in the ecosystem. So you could never rely on your client (or server) interoperating with other clients properly.Audio calls and video also never really worked well. Google tried to push them by releasing libjingle in 2006 (!!!) but it was kinda ignored by everyone. reply vilunov 13 hours agorootparentMost of criticism of XMPP with regards to fragmentation and extensions can be applied to Matrix as well. In fact, the sliding sync itself already fragments the ecosystem by not being supported out of the box by many server implementations and therefore homeservers. Encryption often has to be enabled with some machinations as well if we&#x27;re talking about clients other than Element (and electron-based).On the other hand, XMPP desktop clients certainly work better and faster than Element, although some of them look quite old, which doesn&#x27;t take away from their functionality.IMO it&#x27;s being heavily overstated how Matrix is better than XMPP.Also a nice read: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;telegra.ph&#x2F;why-not-matrix-08-07And the answer https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;wvi9xw&#x2F;why_not_matrix#c_erbsnb reply cyberax 11 hours agorootparentThis criticism kinda misses the point. E2EE, especially for group chats, is _the_ reason to use Matrix. It&#x27;s an extremely hard problem, and you&#x27;ll basically need to replicate what Matrix does if you want to solve it.Doubly so when you add federation.It required more than one iteration of Matrix to get it right, which I (personally) totally expected to happen. I don&#x27;t think XMPP will _ever_ get it right.Regarding clients, I don&#x27;t think Element is worse than most (all?) XMPP clients when you look at the functionality past simple 1-to-1 messaging. And forget about mobile apps, XMPP just sucks on mobile. reply Arathorn 15 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s more that Matrix is different to Jabber&#x2F;XMPP.In Matrix, your chatrooms synchronise chat history between servers (rather than passing messages around), and that history is replicated equally over the participating servers, a bit like Git.In XMPP, you pass messages between clients on different servers using a given server as a hub, and clients can choose to back up their message history on their local server.Which architecture you prefer probably depends on whether you think instant messaging should be about passing messages or archiving chat history. reply kevincox 15 hours agoparentprevIIUC Jabber never really had decentralized group chats? It had MUC but these were federated, so if the server hosting the room went down the chat also died.Matrix rooms are fully decentralized and can survive any servers failing.(Although note that not much else in the protocol is decentralized, much of it is only federated.) reply iptq 13 hours agoprevexciting to hear!

New hires in such teams tend to assume Slack initially and gradually notice that they get very slow responses on Slack, and then switch mainly over to Matrix to talk to the rest of us.It&#x27;s been good to us. Note that our primary comparison point is IRC, not Slack, mainly because of our project roots of openness and widely distributed contributors. So it&#x27;s a serious workplace, but an atypical one. Encryption has periodically caused problems. Leaving the company and maintaining access to your communication seems to be a bit painful. Search is not great. Threads are tolerable.

Hence Matrix 2.0, and Element X. reply gwd 11 hours agorootparentJust poking around matrix.org, it&#x27;s not clear exactly how one would \"route [some] $[s] to support development\" other than paying someone else for a hosted server. Our open-source project just switched to using Matrix from IRC; we&#x27;re not really big enough to warrant hosting our own Matrix server, so most of us are just using matrix.org. We have some industry funding, and try to support other open source projects when we can; but not on the order of $250&#x2F;mo (which if I&#x27;m reading it right, looks like the cheapest product on element.io -- $5&#x2F;user&#x2F;mo, min 50 users).

I&#x27;d also make a link to the membership page from the \"About\" page, and a link to the \"Support Matrix\" page from the \"Membership\" page, so that people who manage to find the Membership page but aren&#x27;t ready to become members can support via patreon &#x2F; whatever.Thanks for all your work on Matrix!

It&#x27;s that Matrix&#x2F;Element actively seeks out partnership with govt&#x2F;LE (to the extent of presenting on stage at a police conference), suggesting they are particularly interested in a relationship with authorities and personally sympathetic to these authorities, at the management&#x2F;director level.This is not a position I expect from an organization that is determined to build secure communications potentially used by activists, people living in oppressive&#x2F;authoritarian regimes, etc... If I was a member of such a high-risk group, I don&#x27;t think I would be putting my faith in this org to produce something I can actually consider truly secure. reply skeaker 15 hours agorootparentI would guess the reason for that would be that those platforms are willing to pony up real cash and the actual communication protocol itself is no less secure when they use it. See also: Tor, famously developed&#x2F;funded by the government reply Arathorn 14 hours agorootparentprevThe reason we \"actively seek out partnership with govt&#x2F;LE\" is simply because they are by far the primary customer segment who actually have an clear need for self-hosted interoperable end-to-end encrypted communication and are willing to pay for it. If we don&#x27;t find organisations who are willing to pay Element for services, then quite simply we can&#x27;t pay people to work on Matrix and Element as their dayjob, and the whole thing would switch into best-effort volunteer run activity (although I&#x27;d presume most of the team would feel pretty burnt if that happened and go spend their freetime on something else). About 80% of Element&#x27;s revenue comes from public sector, and without it the project simply wouldn&#x27;t exist.Hopefully, eventually, the rest of the world will wake up to the fact that sleepwalking into using Teams and Slack (or WhatsApp) is a catastrophe in the making. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone publishes a torrent of every line of Teams scrollback or Slack scrollback for some high-profile organisation; the breach has probably already happened; the breacher is just waiting for the best strategic moment to drop the information bomb.But until then, Element makes payroll by selling to folks like the French and German Governments, the United Nations, etc. They pick Element because it is high trust, and they can audit it and run it themselves. And there is categorically no way that I or other senior management at Element would destroy the company (let alone Matrix) by breaking that trust by letting someone undermine its privacy.Which is why we&#x27;re in the surreal situation of on one hand selling to the UK Government, while also frantically criticising them for the catastrophic idiocy of the Online Safety Bill: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;element.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-....Separately: I&#x27;m literally years overdue in publishing Element&#x27;s internal ethics guidelines publicly, which spells out precisely who we do and don&#x27;t do business with. For what it&#x27;s worth, the high level summary is: * We don&#x27;t sell to criminals (under UK&#x2F;US&#x2F;EU law) * We don&#x27;t sell to sanctioned (by UK&#x2F;US&#x2F;EU) or abusive govts or organisations * We don&#x27;t sell to orgs who explicitly encourage use which goes against our terms of service.Our definition of abusive governments&#x2F;orgs are those who commit human rights abuses or, who commit international atrocities (as defined by the UN), or contracts which primarily support the above.Most western governments (including their police forces) do not fall into this bracket. reply arkaniad 14 hours agorootparentprevFrom a personal perspective, I do share some of your misgivings about the appearance of sympathies with LE &#x2F; authorities.

By Ganesh Sitaraman Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty. SEPTEMBER 21, 2023, 7 AM ET SHARE SAVED STORIES SAVE Last week, Delta Air Lines announced changes to its SkyMiles program that will make accruing status and taking advantage of perks much harder. Instead of relying on a combination of dollars spent and miles traveled in the air, Delta will grant status based on a single metric—dollars spent—and raise the amount of spending required to get it. In short, SkyMiles is no longer a frequent-flier program; it’s a big-spender program. These changes are so drastic that one of the reporters at the preeminent travel-rewards website The Points Guy declared that he’s going to “stop chasing airline status.” When even the points insiders are sick of playing the mileage game, something has clearly gone wrong. In fact, frequent-flier programs are a symptom of a much deeper rot in the American air-travel industry. And although getting mad at airlines is perfectly reasonable, the blame ultimately lies with Congress. From the late 1930s through the ’70s, the federal government regulated airlines as a public utility. The Civil Aeronautics Board decided which airlines could fly what routes and how much they could charge. It aimed to set prices that were fair for travelers and that would provide airlines with a modest profit. Then, in 1978, Congress passed a sweeping law deregulating the airline industry and ultimately abolishing the CAB. Unleashed from regulation, airlines devised new tactics to capture the market. American Airlines was one of the most aggressive. In the lead-up to the deregulation bills, it created discount “super saver” fares to sell off the final few remaining seats on planes. That meant cheap prices for last-minute travelers and more revenue for American, because the planes were going to take off whether or not the seat was filled. But these fares upset business travelers, who tended to buy tickets further in advance for higher prices. So in 1981, American developed AAdvantage, its frequent-flier program, to give them additional benefits. Other airlines followed suit. Read: Air travel is a disaster right now. Here’s why. In the early years, these programs were simple, like the punch card at a café where your 11th coffee is free. But three big changes transformed them into the systems we know today. First, in 1987, American partnered with Citibank to offer a branded credit card that offered points redeemable for flights on the airline. Second, in the ’90s, the airlines proliferated the number of fare classes, charging differential prices for tickets. With more complicated fare structures came the third change: Virgin America realized that the amount people spend on a flight, based on the fare class, is more important to their bottom line than the number of miles flown. So, in 2007, it introduced a loyalty program rewarding money spent rather than mileage accrued. These three shifts fundamentally transformed the airline industry. They turned frequent-flier systems into the sprawling points systems they are today. And they turned airlines into something more like financial institutions that happen to fly planes on the side. Here’s how the system works now: Airlines create points out of nothing and sell them for real money to banks with co-branded credit cards. The banks award points to cardholders for spending, and both the banks and credit-card companies make money off the swipe fees from the use of the card. Cardholders can redeem points for flights, as well as other goods and services sold through the airlines’ proprietary e-commerce portals. For the airlines, this is a great deal. They incur no costs from points until they are redeemed—or ever, if the points are forgotten. This setup has made loyalty programs highly lucrative. Consumers now charge nearly 1 percent of U.S. GDP to Delta’s American Express credit cards alone. A 2020 analysis by the Financial Times found that Wall Street lenders valued the major airlines’ mileage programs more highly than the airlines themselves. United’s MileagePlus program, for example, was valued at $22 billion, while the company’s market cap at the time was only $10.6 billion. Is this a good deal for the American consumer? That’s a trickier question. Paying for a flight or a hotel room with points may feel like a free bonus, but because credit-card-swipe fees increase prices across the economy—Visa or Mastercard takes a cut of every sale—redeeming points is more like getting a little kickback. Certainly the system is bad for Americans who don’t have points-earning cards. They pay higher prices on ordinary goods and services but don’t get the points, effectively subsidizing the perks of card users, who tend to be wealthier already. Like the federal reserve, airlines issue currency—points—out of thin air. They also get to decide how much that currency is worth and what it can be spent on. This helps explain why the points system feels so opaque and, often, unfair. Online analysts try to offer estimates of points’ cash value, but airlines can reduce these values after the fact and change how points can be redeemed. Airlines even sell points at above their exchange-rate valuation, meaning that people are paying for something worth less than the money they’re buying it with, in part because it’s so hard to know what the real value is. In this context, it’s easy to see why Delta is making changes. The shift to a focus on spending, rather than mileage, has long been coming, because of the rise of multiple fare classes and the decoupling of mileage and revenue. Limiting benefits and increasing the requirements for status, meanwhile, looks like a way to spread out costs: 1 percent of GDP spending is a lot of outstanding points that could be redeemed. Still, you might wonder how airlines can get away with angering their customers by devaluing loyalty programs. Aren’t they worried that those customers will get a little less loyal? Well, not really. The U.S. has only four major carriers, which account for more than three-quarters of the market, and they tend to move in lockstep. Indeed, American Airlines recently made a similar change to its mileage program. Customers don’t have many other places to go. In this and other respects, the strange evolution of airlines into quasi-banks reflects how badly deregulation has gone. Regulation carefully set the terms under which airlines could do business. It was designed to ensure that they remained a stable business and a reliable mode of transportation. Deregulation, in turn, allowed the airlines to pursue profits in whatever way they could—including getting into the financial sector. The proponents of deregulation made a few big promises. The cost of flying would go down once airlines were free to compete on price. The industry would get less monopolistic as hundreds of new players entered the market, and it would be stable even without the government guaranteeing profitable rates. Small cities wouldn’t lose service. In the deregulators’ minds, airlines were like any other business. If they were allowed to compete freely, the magic of the market would make everything better. Whatever was good for the airlines’ bottom line would be good for consumers. They were wrong. As I explain in my forthcoming book, most of their predictions didn’t come true, because air travel isn’t a normal business. There are barriers to entry, such as the fixed supply of airport runways and gates. (And, for that matter, mileage programs, designed to keep customers from ditching an established airline for a rival.) There are network effects and economies of scale. There are high capital costs. (Airplanes aren’t cheap.) The idea that anyone could successfully start an airline and outcompete the big incumbents never made much sense. After a relatively short period of fierce competition, the deregulated era quickly turned to consolidation and cost-cutting, as dozens of airlines either went bankrupt or were acquired. Service keeps getting worse, because the airlines, facing little competition, have nothing to fear from antagonizing passengers with cramped legroom, cancellations, and ever-multiplying fees for baggage and snacks. Worse still, without mandated service, cities and regions across the country have lost commercial air service, with serious consequences for their economies. And when a crisis like 9/11 or the coronavirus pandemic comes along, the airlines—which prefer to direct their profits to stock buybacks rather than rainy-day funds—need massive financial relief from the federal government. Read: Somehow, airline customer service is getting even worse Deregulation even failed to deliver the one thing it is sometimes credited with: lowering prices. Airfare did get cheaper in the years after the 1978 deregulation law. But the cost of flying had already been falling before deregulation, and it kept falling after at about the same rate. The old system of airline regulation wasn’t perfect. Barred from competing directly on price, the airlines got into an amenities arms race that notoriously included in-flight piano bars. But the cure was worse than the disease. The industry went from being a regulated oligopoly, which had real problems, to an unregulated oligopoly, which we are now seeing is much worse. Airlines serve a vital public need, just like railroads, the electric grid, and communication networks. They also exist within a system of special privileges from the government. The public has built and paid for a substantial federal infrastructure to coordinate flights safely. Historically, these are all standard reasons to regulate an industry. A modernized set of rules could arrest the trajectory of airlines becoming financialized e-commerce platforms—and maybe even get them to focus on making air travel less miserable.

The Civil Aeronautics Board decided which airlines could fly what routes and how much they could charge. It aimed to set prices that were fair for travelers and that would provide airlines with a modest profit. Then, in 1978, Congress passed a sweeping law deregulating the airline industry and ultimately abolishing the CAB. Unleashed from regulation, airlines devised new tactics to capture the market.That makes it sound like air travel was great before free markets stepped in. The real cost of air travel fell by about half since then. Before deregulation, there weren&#x27;t as many competitive incentives, and airlines couldn&#x27;t experiment with routes. Air travel became much more popular and got much safer (this might be a coincidence). Granted, service got worse, but you can still buy service at 2x the price in first class. People just don&#x27;t.There are probably a bit too few customer and worker protections, but on the whole, airline deregulation shows just how bad command economies are at planning and allocating resources. reply dools 11 hours agoparent> There are probably a bit too few customer and worker protections, but on the whole, airline deregulation shows just how bad command economies are at planning and allocating resources.I would say that it demonstrates that, where competition exists, deregulation can achieve some pretty good results. It&#x27;s worth noting that consumers can choose which airline to fly every time they fly and the cost of switching is non-existent (absent loyalty programs which is why they&#x27;re called loyalty programs).It&#x27;s also worth noting that since airlines are pretty critical infrastructure, when there&#x27;s an economic downturn and the government bails them out, the government is essentially subsidising the discounts of the previous 10 years and generally doesn&#x27;t do it for the very small airlines that aren&#x27;t too big to fail so it&#x27;s also still a bit government-ish. reply arcticbull 10 hours agorootparentNot to mention the government is still actively involved through programs like Essential Air Service [1]It wasn&#x27;t fully deregulated and left alone, some aspects were deregulated.

Yet the author seems content to pretend there’s some mysterious factor that causes prices to fall for decades that we can infer from just a few year’s data. From first principles, you should always expect that regulation increases prices and the burden of proof is to argue why it would not. Embarrassing that the author is a professor and didn’t bother making a proper argument.A key argument that led to deregulators winning is showing that intra-state fares—which were not federally regulated—were about 40% cheaper than one might expect when comparing to interstate. Anyway, there are articles that go into various reasons why deregulation very probably substantially decreases fares. reply Sai_ 10 hours agorootparentThat prices were falling prior to deregulation and did not fall even faster after deregulation proves that deregulation wasn’t a factor.If you’re coasting to earth in a parachute and someone gives you a cup of coffee to drink which does nothing to change your rate of descent, would you then attribute your descent to the cup of coffee?You even say it yourself: There’s lots of reasons… but deregulation wasn’t necessarily it especially not in the axiomatic way you say when you say that by “first principles”, regulations increase prices.E.g., regulations and legislation around marijuana access have decreased prices, the ultimate “price” being a stint in jail for possession. reply arkis22 8 hours agorootparentYou are wrong that prices falling prior to deregulation proves that deregulation wasn&#x27;t a factor in declining prices. A graph of numbers showing decreasing costs measures purely quantitative factors. The trend continuing completely excludes qualitative factors, of which you must understand to properly understand what is going on. For example, the article says that what was expected to happen was that costs would fall because there would be an influx of hundreds of competitors. That in itself is a misunderstanding of qualitative factors. Imagine there being 100 different airlines. More than half of them would be incompetent. The correct qualitative understanding of the situation is that deregulation allows the most competent airlines to consolidate&#x2F;buy underperforming ones. Did service really get worse? Or is the difference really just that these airlines are now able to transport way more people at a cheaper cost because they are no longer catering to smokers who like to leer at PANAM blondes in short skirts?Also, regulation around marijuana has not decreased prices. This is obvious because in places where marijuana is now decriminalized people still prefer to buy from illegal sellers... because it is cheaper. reply tmpX7dMeXU 13 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t just get to say “from first principles” and then put forward your obviously-American POV as some immovable basis from which everyone else should be arguing from.Regulation routinely reduces cost.

Lemon laws are widely recognised as making it cheaper to buy a reliable car. Food safety regulations made food a lot cheaper by rendering imported food trustworthy. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparentWhat you&#x27;re getting at here is regulations that... increase the competitiveness of a market. Which does imply something about the preexisting competitiveness of that market, and was the reason for that caveat.Competitive markets are what keep prices down, and you need a regulatory environment that facilitates them. The trouble is you can&#x27;t even say things like \"food safety regulations increase competition by rendering unknown sources trustworthy\" because it depends on both details and context. You could easily have food safety regulations that impose high overhead and drive small providers out of business, or different market dynamics that provide an alternate way for customers to evaluate trustworthiness.And each attempt is an opportunity to make a mistake and do the opposite of what you intended -- or the exact thing the incumbents wanted and lobbied for. It has to be done with care, and rarely in only cases of great need, because it&#x27;s so easy to screw up. And then competition can&#x27;t fix it, because regulations are enforced by a monopoly. Which is where we are now, in all too many cases. reply renewiltord 7 hours agorootparentWell, I&#x27;m as pro-market as the next person, but surely fire brigades are the classic anti-example: the market was competitive with many fire brigades, prices were inelastic sure, and there was a lot of time-elasticity of demand, but the customer had the short-term ability to shop, etc. Government regulated fire brigades reduced competition and decreased cost.I default to \"regulation increases cost\" as well, and think that the default position should be to justify it, but I don&#x27;t think the opposite is a zero-instance situation. reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparentThe time-elasticity of demand is the reason there was no price competition. You use whichever fire brigade arrives on the scene first. So you get lots of competition for getting there fast but not for lowering the price. It&#x27;s like a competition for who gets to be the monopoly today.And then because it was a chance to monopolize something it got infested with organized crime. Which is the main reason it was short-lived and never got to evolve into a functioning market. Governments found it easier to prohibit whatever was going on there than hire enough police to arrest all the firefighters.There are fairly obvious ways to recreate something that looks pretty much like the modern system without government regulation. A city has however many fire houses that major fire insurers prepay a rate negotiated based on how many homes they insure in that service area. Since prepaying is cheaper than paying per-incident that&#x27;s what substantially all the insurers do, which mutes the incentive for firefighters to hack each other to pieces to get there first.That still isn&#x27;t a lot of competition, but at least now you&#x27;re negotiating for a price before the house is on fire. Which could be enough to cost less than what the government currently does. reply patmcc 12 hours agorootparentprev>>Can you provide an example of this actually happening in a competitive market?Tobacco companies probably made a bunch more money as aspects of their advertising became restricted&#x2F;regulated&#x2F;banned - because they were basically in an arms race with one another and spending more and more to maintain market share.

Prohibiting certain things only takes options away. If they weren&#x27;t the lowest cost options to begin with then prices may not increase, but then you have to ask why anybody would have chosen that to begin with over the thing that costs less.

You can add lines of code which use a more efficient algorithm. reply _gabe_ 12 hours agorootparent> You can add lines of code which use a more efficient algorithm.Yes, so the burden of proof is on the algorithm. Adding more lines of code, by default, makes the code slower. If the algorithm is more efficient, it can make the code faster. But it must be more efficient.This logic seems to hold up to me, but maybe I’m missing something here? reply r_sreeram 10 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s an excellent example of what GP said: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FJJTYQYB1JQ (long video, skip to 26:00 if you are in a hurry)The key is that code isn&#x27;t running in a vacuum. It&#x27;s operating on data (or controlling systems, etc). A smaller amount of code may be operating on the data in an inefficient manner, whereas a larger amount may be doing it more efficiently.In the above talk, this contrast is very stark, because the \"more code\" version does some stuff and then does the exact thing the \"less code\" version does, yet is faster.This kind of thing is common enough (albeit less stark than in the above example), that \"less code is faster\" is not a great \"default\" assumption to make. reply michaelmrose 12 hours agorootparentprevHaving more lines of code doesn&#x27;t even reliably map to having more machine instructions let alone time complexity of solution. Given 2 programs lines of code is a measure so worthless that no reasonable evaluator would start with the assumption that the smaller solution is faster and work from there. They would instead start with the actual code. The point of the analogy which is easily lost in comparing the mechanics of the actual thing is that you must in truth examine the regulation to discern if it on overall makes things more expensive rather than starting off by making the assumption that it does. reply _gabe_ 9 hours agorootparentSure, lines of code doesn’t correlate to how much actual code is produced, but I feel like that’s just being pedantic. The assumption that I’m stating here is: the more stuff a CPU has to do, generally the longer it’s going to take to do the stuff.I’m not arguing that a more complex algorithm can do the same stuff quicker. Of course you can do that. There’s plenty of examples of that. But in the general case, doing more things takes longer.Of course, the CPU can execute instructions in parallel, it can pipeline instructions and gain a higher throughput, it can predict branches, etc. But those are things you have to be intentional about enabling more often than not. Making small changes in the higher level code can ruin whatever performance gains you had gained because you accidentally trashed the throughput or something.Generally, more instructions takes longer to process. Of course, a more complex algorithm can do the stuff quicker. But it’s not the default and depending on the problem, it can be very difficult to get it to go quicker with more instructions.This isn’t even something that should be hard to conceptualize. Getting an element out of an array using an index is O(1). Getting an element out of a hashmap is also O(1) (when there’s no collisions). Even though these both perform the same in terms of complexity (“constant” time) the array will win every time if you already know the index. Why? Because the hashmap uses more instructions to figure out where the index is.So I really don’t understand why the assumption that: generally, more code = slower is a bad one to make. Unless you explicitly try to make the code with more instructions faster, it will usually be slower than if you did it with less instructions. reply michaelmrose 4 hours agorootparent> Sure, lines of code doesn’t correlate to how much actual code is produced, but I feel like that’s just being pedantic.It is actually the core of the entire understanding. There is no mapping whatsoever lines of code and instructions executed. A finite program that doesn&#x27;t halt will result in infinite instructions. Less pedantically a sorting function that is far more efficient will result in the instructions corresponding to individual operations being called thousands of times less.Basically everything from function calls to loops ruins any mapping between brevity and execution time. reply sahila 12 hours agorootparentprevOf course it&#x27;s not always true but I think there&#x27;s an implicit assumption of \"all things equal\". The same efficient algorithm written in more lines of code vs less lines of code would be less cpu instructions in the latter. reply nerdbert 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that assumption is implicit in this argument, since it&#x27;s specifically about whether complexity can lead to better optimization. replydredmorbius 10 hours agorootparentprevNB:reply Retric 8 hours agoparentprevThe drop in price has a great deal to do with improving technology not simply competition driving down prices and how little room people are willing to accept.An apples to apples comparison with equivalent legroom etc a domestic flight in 1970 was often cheaper than what people see today.

Why do you think that might have been?Hint: think about industries where there isn&#x27;t much competition. Do we see similar improvements there, usually? reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentThere very much was global competition in the airline manufacturing market in the 1970’s. US airlines also weren’t the only people buying aircraft at the time so those regulations didn’t actually impact manufacturing very much.As to improvements without competition, it’s surprisingly common. AT&T was a huge hotbed of technical innovation when they were a monopoly from ever improving switches and fiber optics etc but they even produced one of the first commercial Unix System V. They also played a surprisingly large role in early satellites literally owning the first commercial communications satellite used for the first live transatlantic television signal. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TelstarMonopolies often spend huge sums on R&D outside of their core business. Google’s self driving car is exactly the kind of investment you see when companies have more money than they know what to do with. Xerox for example developed the desktop UI mouse included when they held a huge monopoly, not that it helped them but it did push the industry forward quite a bit. reply WillPostForFood 6 hours agorootparentAT&T may have innovated in their labs, but they were glacially slow pushing innovation out to consumers.

The parent comment is that you cannot throw away the competition and still expect innovations to happen. reply fein 7 hours agorootparentAnd my question is what industries that don&#x27;t have competition also don&#x27;t innovate? I am not aware of nor can play devils advocate and try to imagine an example.Had deregulation not happened for airlines in the 70&#x27;s, why would we expect that they wouldn&#x27;t innovate to produce less expensive and more reliable aircraft? Any sort of improvements there makes a bigger profit and avoids killing customers (also pretty good for profit). reply quanto 7 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of examples. I will give one in transport, as we are discussing here.Seoul and Tokyo have the most extensive subway systems in the world. Both have both privately owned and de facto government-owned lines through government business entity. The innovation here is connecting key areas in the city. The new lines that connect new city centers that emerged are privately owned; they care about profit and they are incentivized to provide popular, convenient services by connecting new city centers. Also, there are other innovations like self-driving trains in those private lines (see Shinbundang Line, the newest in Seoul). A government line with legally guaranteed profit is less poised to innovate although some innovations happen due to popular demands or government initiatives.It&#x27;s not that government-led projects have zero innovations, but they tend to have less momentum than well-motivated well-aligned private corporations. Well-aligned (with the public&#x27;s interest) is the key here.I don&#x27;t know if particular examples prove anything, but you asked for examples, and here it is.

You let people mindlessly pursue their short term interests, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to efficient behavior at the aggregate level.Arguably what has made society more efficient, at least for automobiles, has not been \"capitalism\", but government regulation - safety, environmental, and cutting down on drunk driving. If you consider \"dying en route\" to be \"inefficient\", then you&#x27;d agree that while just building nicer looking cars with bigger tailfins to please the market didn&#x27;t really do much to reduce this inefficiency, government mandating bumpers and seatbelts and airbags did. reply nickpp 2 minutes agorootparent> buying a sewing machine and making your own clothingBut why stop there?! Cultivate your own cotton, make your own cloth. Mine and smelt your own iron.

It was not meant to keep prices down.So when we got rid of airline regulation, prices went down. Some airlines did implode, but not as badly as rail did.Thankfully for airlines, it seems flying is a lot more indispensable than riding by rail. reply jandrese 14 hours agorootparentAirlines had the advantage of not having to compete with a shiny new industry the way rail did with airlines. I&#x27;m sure airlines would have suffered greatly had we developed cheap rocket power transport or high speed pneumatic tubes or some other zany sci-fi transport that left the airlines looking slow and overpriced.Rail in the US died because US cities are far enough apart that flying made a noticeable difference in travel times, unlike more compact countries. There&#x27;s a reason Amtrak only works well in the relatively dense northeastern seaboard of the US.That said, the airline industry is one where competition seems to be working pretty well. It&#x27;s a market success story. The most efficient market is one where everybody is making close to 0 profit, and that&#x27;s a good description of the airline industry in the past few decades, especially when you focus on the relatively small part of the airline industry that deals with flying planes and their passengers. reply cryptonector 11 hours agorootparentprev> Thankfully for airlines, it seems flying is a lot more indispensable than riding by rail.More like air routes are a lot cheaper to change than rails.

The only datapoint I know of is Sears, which tried something similar and went down in flames reply lucas_membrane 14 hours agorootparentBut Sears gave Donald Rumsfeld a lifetime discount card. Which brings us to the major government subsidy of US airlines. People work for airlines at reduced wages to have available very great discounts on their personal travel, totally untaxed.

Let&#x27;s talk about the energy sector! I worked professionally in that area.Europe and the US are most definitely not counter-examples. Power generation is almost everywhere done commercially.

In many areas it is the only energy company in town. Are you trying to say that, just because it&#x27;s a private company, it&#x27;s not centrally planned? That each section of its business is in some sort of free market?Private corporate ownership and central planning are not mutually exclusive.

For example, the government is not saying that Duke must put ten gas power plants in a particular location for $10 by 2025.> That each section of its business is in some sort of free market?Funnily enough, this is pretty close to how Duke operates. The central holding company only deals with the strategic planning, and its subsidiaries make their own plans to implement these plans.But anyway, even in the areas where Duke has a legal monopoly, it has to contend with other utilities, otherwise its monopoly will end.> Private corporate ownership and central planning are not mutually exclusive.They are. Central planning from the government means that there&#x27;s no meaning in private ownership. Centrally planned industries are not affected by the market forces, so they can become inefficient without the market feedback.Central goal setting is fine, but not planning. reply sandpaper26 5 hours agorootparentIt looks like we&#x27;re working off fundamentally different definitions of central planning, so of course we disagree. Central planning, in my vernacular, does not at all imply government control. It simply means that most decisions are made by some sort of central authority and executed by decentralized agents, rather than plans being made by the agents themselves. This is how most non-franchise businesses operate.If you require central planning to retain an element of planning by the government in your definition, then I agree, energy is not a good example of this. replycryptonector 11 hours agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t each individual airline is itself a command economy, internally?Perhaps, but in competition with others.

There used to be competition. Idk what happened exactly, but then we had no competition and they were regulated.Public transportation? New York&#x27;s subways (90% of existing track!) were built by two competing companies, then NYC regulated them into bankruptcy, and then NYC acquired them. Similarly with busses and trolleys. There used to be a vibrant trolley system in New York, then the city killed it and \"nationalized\" it. Compare to Buenos Aires, where they never nationalized the bus system, and which has a privately operated bus system that is the envy of every American city!Cable systems also had competition, but then all the towns regulated them.If Edison and Westinghouse could compete a century ago, they could compete today.Roads are pretty much the main case where I&#x27;d agree there&#x27;s a natural monopoly, and then only because there&#x27;s not enough physical surface space for competition.In any case, airlines are far far from natural monopolies. Airports might be, but not airlines. reply bpodgursky 16 hours agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t each individual airline is itself a command economy, internallyYes.

Besides the obvious facts that you cannot withdraw money from an account or pay your bills, if they didn’t fly planes the points would be ~worthless.The fact that they don’t profit from those activities is a market economy working as intended*.

The seating chart doesn’t visualize leg room or cleanliness or the details of the seat design on that particular flight. If there were reliable indicators of these things, people might choose to pay more for some of those. reply hakfoo 5 hours agorootparentOne consequence of giving everything a discrete price is that it drives customers to consume all services they pay for completely.If you say \"I can take two checked bags, it&#x27;s included in the fare\", I&#x27;ll probably only take one because I only need one for the duration of my trip. But I&#x27;ll feel good knowing if I decide I see something awesome while on my vacation, I can take it home without too much care for penalty fees.But if you say \"Each checked bag is $50\", people will pack everything up to and including an entire 1996 Toyota Corolla into their free carry-ons, exhaust the available space, and the airline has to say to the economy class late-boarding group &#x27;everyone after this line has to check their bag anyway, but we won&#x27;t charge you the $50.\"As an added plus, the price awareness reduces the quality of the travel experience-- you end up asking \"can I fit another souvenir in my little free bag\", and often deciding against it, because it&#x27;s insanity to spend $50 in bag fees for a $10 book. replydoublemint2202 16 hours agorootparentprevif we could somehow structure our incentives to be a net positive for humanity overall, we&#x27;d be in a much better spot reply jjoonathan 16 hours agorootparentYeah, but markets care less about what people want and more about what rich people want -- which, by and large, is to get paid for being rich. reply creato 9 hours agorootparentI would bet 99% of people buying commercial airline tickets are nothing like the people you’re imagining (living primarily off investments?) reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentprevMost of the money belongs to the middle class, not the rich.

The blood lead level is mean lifetime blood lead level in children younger than 5 years. The solid line is the central estimate and the shaded area is the 95% CI as per the study by Crump and colleagues. IQ=intelligence quotient. Credit: The Lancet Planetary Health (2023). DOI: 10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00166-3 Lead poisoning has a far greater impact on global health than previously thought, potentially contributing to over five million deaths a year and posing a similar threat to air pollution, modeling research suggested Tuesday. The study, described as \"a wake-up call\", also estimated that exposure to the toxic metal causes young children in developing countries to lose an average of nearly six IQ points each. Lead pollution has been shown to cause a range of serious health problems, particularly relating to heart disease and the brain development of small children, resulting in leaded gasoline being banned worldwide. But people can still be exposed to the potent neurotoxin via food, soil, cookware, fertilizers, cosmetics, lead-acid car batteries and other sources. The two World Bank economists who authored the study, published in the Lancet Planetary Health journal, said it was the first to assess the impact of lead exposure on heart disease deaths and child IQ loss in wealthy and developing nations. Lead author Bjorn Larsen told AFP that when the pair first saw the figure their model calculated, \"we didn't even dare to whisper the number\" because it was so \"enormous\". Their model estimates that 5.5 million adults died from heart disease in 2019 because of lead exposure, 90 percent of them in low- and middle-income countries. That is six times higher than the previous estimate, and represents around 30 percent of all deaths from cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death worldwide. It would mean that lead exposure is a bigger cause of heart disease than smoking or cholesterol, Larsen said. $6 trillion cost The research also estimated that children under five lost a cumulative 765 million IQ points due to lead poisoning globally in 2019, with 95 percent of those losses coming in developing countries. That number is nearly 80 percent higher than previously estimated. The World Bank researchers put the economic cost of lead exposure at $6 trillion in 2019, equivalent to seven percent of global gross domestic product. For the analysis, the researchers used estimates of blood lead levels in 183 countries taken from the landmark 2019 Global Burden of Disease study. Previous research had measured only lead's effect on heart disease when it came to raising blood pressure. But the new study looked at numerous other ways lead affects hearts, such as the hardening of arteries that can lead to stroke, resulting in the higher numbers, Larsen said. Roy Harrison, an expert in air pollution and health at Birmingham University in the UK, who was not involved in the study, told AFP it was \"interesting, but subject to many uncertainties\". For example, the relationship between lead in blood and heart disease is based on a survey in the United States, and whether those findings could be applied worldwide \"is a huge jump of faith\", he said. Harrison also pointed out that the model used estimations—not tests—of lead in blood in many developing countries. If the results were confirmed, \"they would be of major public health significance, but at present, this is simply an interesting hypothesis\", he said. 'Piece of the puzzle' Richard Fuller, president of the NGO Pure Earth, said that when surveys in developing countries did test for lead in blood, they mostly found higher levels than estimated in the new study. This means \"the impact of lead might be worse than the report describes\", he told AFP, calling it a \"wake-up call\". Larsen said \"we're still a little in the dark\" when it came to understanding how much different sources of lead contribute to blood contamination. Fuller said part of this \"missing piece of the puzzle\" was revealed in a Pure Earth report released on Tuesday, which analyzed 5,000 samples of consumer goods and food in 25 developing countries. It found high rates of lead contamination in metal pots and pans, ceramic cookware, paint, cosmetics and toys. \"This is why poorer countries have so much lead poisoning,\" Fuller said. \"It's items in the kitchen that are poisoning them.\" More information: Bjorn Larsen et al, Global health burden and cost of lead exposure in children and adults: a health impact and economic modelling analysis, The Lancet Planetary Health (2023).

For those who don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s a strong (if faulty) correlation between lead levels in preschool children and crime rates: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;1&#x2F;14&#x2F;17991876&#x2F;crime-drop-murder-lea...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesisRegardless of what you think about the hypothesis, the growth and crunch in lead levels during the last many decades is astounding and probably still has many bad effects on IQ and related factors, at least in the US reply npunt 10 hours agoparentI like this roundup [1] as it hammers the point home with tons of observations across cultures, times, contexts, and methods of analysis. For instance, different cultures phased out lead gas at different times, and their subsequent crime charts were offset by the equivalent years.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;kevin-drum&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;an-updated-le... reply Willish42 9 hours agorootparentThanks, this is way more thorough than the links I was able to find &#x2F; select from a quick search at the time.If anything, I think I&#x27;ve accidentally experienced a lesser case of [Cunningham&#x27;s Law](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cunningham%27s_Law), where the veracity of the hypothesis is arguably pretty clear-cut and I just lacked the evidence, and the internet is obliged to correct&#x2F;help in that regard! reply Gigachad 9 hours agorootparentprevnext [18 more] The car and its consequences has been a disaster for society. Even today we are pumping so many toxins in to the air to deliver a slower, less efficient, and more expensive form of transport. And it&#x27;s not a problem that EVs or self driving cars can solve since a huge amount of the pollution comes from tires. reply maxerickson 7 hours agorootparentIn lots of places the tailpipe emissions of a modern car are cleaner than the air.CO2 is a pollutant, but it&#x27;s not a toxin when the concentration is low and oxygen is available. reply adrianN 6 hours agorootparentThat conveniently ignores the non-tailpipe emissions, for example dust from tires and brake pads. I also suspect that it&#x27;s only true in the lab, I have the pleasure of cycling through many clouds of noxious soot from supposedly modern cars whose owners just happen to press the throttle harder than what the NEDC requires. reply swader999 6 hours agorootparentprevCO2 is a fertilizer. reply Terr_ 6 hours agorootparent\"I&#x27;ll take &#x27;facile and reductive statements&#x27; for $100 please, Alex.\"CO2 is demonstrably emitted as a pollutant, but it&#x27;s only a fertilizer in pretty poetic sense: Plant growth is bottlenecked by other factors. reply 8bitsrule 5 hours agorootparentprevSo is rape ....https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yaleclimateconnections.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;more-co2-in-the-a... reply stephen_g 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd water is essential for life, so that must mean it’s impossible to drown, right?Funny that people who say things like this and “CO2 is only 0.04% of the air” don’t want to try injecting 0.04% of their blood volume of hydrogen cyanide and seeing if such a tiny amount of something can have an effect… reply CapstanRoller 6 hours agorootparentprevBy that logic, so is ammonia.Care to take a big huff off a farmer&#x27;s anhydrous ammonia tank? reply hodgesrm 8 hours agorootparentprev> Even today we are pumping so many toxins in to the air to deliver a slower, less efficient, and more expensive form of transport.Slower than what? reply Gigachad 8 hours agorootparentWalkable cities + public transport. When I had a car it used to take me a minimum of 10 minutes to get anywhere. Cars have spaced out everything so far that over all we spend so much more time traveling. Now I live in a walkable area and almost everything I need is a few minutes away on foot, or a 20 minute train trip to the main city area. reply mtalantikite 8 hours agorootparentI swear that living in NYC for nearly two decades has made me incapable of making a grocery list and shopping like pretty much everyone else in the country (only slightly kidding). I just walk down the street and grab what I need.I did just miss the 6 train by 15 seconds and am standing on the platform as I write this, which I guess is annoying? I’ll take it over driving in traffic though. reply muglug 7 hours agorootparentWhenever I leave NYC and go anywhere else in the US, walking a mile feels like an act of silent rebellion. reply Gigachad 7 hours agorootparentHad a friend from Texas move near me in Australia and they have just been exhausted trying to keep up because they aren&#x27;t used to walking. Walking here is the fastest and most convenient way to get around. By the time you get your car out and find parking, you could have already been there on foot.You&#x27;ll observe that the rate of obesity is extremely low in the walkable areas which I really think is heavily because the people there live more active lifestyles just getting around day to day. reply kortilla 5 hours agorootparentThe rate of obesity is low because of survivorship bias, nothing more, nothing less. For obese and&#x2F;or disabled people, living in New York is an absolute nightmare if you can’t afford public transit.Despite loving the city amenities, culture, nightlife, one of my family members had to give up and leave NYC because he couldn’t afford cabs everywhere and hated showing up to events late and sweat-soaked otherwise. replym463 7 hours agoparentprevI remember reading somewhere that lead exposure might correlate with poverty. Is this accounted for? reply theptip 6 hours agorootparentIt does correlate, and it is accounted for. We have evidence to believe the causal arrow points lead=>poverty. This is because the natural experiments of phasing out leaded gasoline in different countries at effectively randomized times produce subsequent decreases in lead poisoning (and downstream crime). This is as close to a controlled \"give one population lead poisoning\" experiment as you can ethically run. reply SideburnsOfDoom 3 hours agorootparentBut there is also poverty => poor housing in less desirable areas => more pollution in general. Including Air pollution, car exhausts, lead from leaded gasoline.This is well known e.g. (1) and seems like it would be a large effect.I&#x27;m not saying that this invalidates the studies on lead, I&#x27;m sure that the researchers know how to do it far better than I do, and have spend a lot more time on accounting for it; just that poverty drives increased pollution exposure, as a general rule.1) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.london.gov.uk&#x2F;%20New%20report%20shows%20shocking... reply jeffbee 11 hours agoparentprevThe subsequent evidence is so strong that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to call it faulty. In the paper \"Life After Lead\" they study a boundary effect of children who were just above and just below treatment thresholds for blood lead levels and the outcomes in terms of crime, school success, etc are stark. Figure 4(F) particularly.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeaweb.org&#x2F;articles?id=10.1257&#x2F;app.20160056 reply harles 10 hours agorootparentI haven’t read the paper, but I wonder how well they control for economic status. I’d expect the better off a family is the less lead they have in their life - and I’d expect economic status to actually be a cause of better education, health, incarceration, etc. reply waster 10 hours agorootparentThey said “we compare outcomes for children who are similar across observable characteristics but differ in eligibility for intervention due to blood lead test results.” Economic status is observable, so ide guess it’s I caused; but I only read the abstract. reply thriftwy 10 hours agoparentprevLate Soviet writers such as Strugatsky brothers would often bring out the topic of barbarism and brutality which is characteristic of Human race and had to be fought at all times......which is, as far as we know now, not innate but looks like symptoms of chronic lead poisoning. reply SideburnsOfDoom 3 hours agorootparentLead poisoning is far from the _only_ cause of the darker side of human nature. reply thriftwy 33 minutes agorootparentThe surprising is that this side turned to be manageable.People around them ended up not wanting to actively destroy themselves and their environment. That was the big surprise of 00&#x27;s and it coincided with aftermatch of when the lead gas was outlawed.It seems based on the last years&#x27; news that the USA is having a reenactment of that now, though. I wonder what it takes this time to fix things. reply darkerside 9 hours agoparentprevWhat is a faulty correlation? They&#x27;re correlated or they&#x27;re not. There&#x27;s may be a faulty casual attribution, but that is another topic. reply Willish42 9 hours agorootparentI had meant that despite the statistical correlation being objective and strong, the logic behind a causal link was faulty.That might not be the case though (?), see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;kevin-drum&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;an-updated-le... from the other reply reply keepamovin 9 hours agorootparentDo you mean faulty, logic, or faulty, supporting evidence? I think if something is plausible, but unsupported by evidence, the logic can be sound, but the supporting evidence faulty; but if something is implausible, then it would be the logic that was faulty and to me it seems like that crime and behavioral changes are caused by lead is certainly plausible, so I don’t think it’s a logical failure here. It may just be a failure of the evidence.So.. How do you know the evidence is faulty, though? I mean, can you definitively prove it’s faulty? if you can’t, then you have to consider there’s a possibility that it’s causal? reply Willish42 8 hours agorootparentSee above. The Vox article made this seem like logic around the hypothesis is more faulty than it probably is, given other replies.I understand my meaning might&#x27;ve confused HN commenters but I genuinely feel that the intent of my words in the initial comment is intuitive, and don&#x27;t have time or bandwidth to argue about the semantics. I am sorry for the confusion. I obviously can&#x27;t definitively prove it is faulty, and was merely trying (likely incorrectly so) to summarize the believed veracity of the hypothesis. reply keepamovin 5 hours agorootparentVox, always shillin&#x27; for illogic. HahahI thought that&#x27;s what you were doing, intuitively, and I wasn&#x27;t attacking you. I know how it can feel that way. It&#x27;s more like a jumping off point for other commenters to hop onto, a group conversation if you will, but the threaded nature does make it look like a direct challenge&#x2F;reply to you.You know you can&#x27;t be sorry for other people&#x27;s confusion tho, right? That might be some semantics for you! :) hahaHave a good day and thanks for sharing this interesting ref! reply fsckboy 4 hours agorootparentprevselection bias can cause faulty correlations. If you select on the basis of a correlation, you don&#x27;t get to say you found a correlation. reply hedora 15 hours agoprevI&#x27;d like to point out that, although it is illegal to put lead in water supply lines in the US, there is a loophole that allows it in hot water lines.As a result, for certain fittings, most big-box hardware stores only sell the leaded variants, and label them \"hot water heater supply line\" or something similar. reply amluto 15 hours agoparentThere’s another loophole: “lead free” means that the wetted surface is no more than 0.25% lead (by mass, I think).As far as I know, lead has nice properties as an element added to brass alloys. Which is not an excuse for using it, IMO.(Why is any of this still a thing? Stainless steel is cheaper than copper these days, and it’s a great material as long as you aren’t trying to screw one piece of stainless steel into another, and there isn’t a great reason why one should need to do much of that. And there are some excellent plastics available, too.) reply thfuran 14 hours agorootparentAre there? It seems like plastics are shaping up to be the modern day lead. reply hadlock 13 hours agorootparentLead roofing tends to get recycled into bullets in time of war, but those roofs that don&#x27;t, are typically there forever (400+ years) and never leak. Some plastics are UV resistant due to additives but even copper struggles to compete with lead as a roofing material. You only need to look back to the 1970s to find PEX water piping and the disaster&#x2F;flooding it can cause due to age. reply sokoloff 13 hours agorootparentAre you thinking of polybutylene pipe, rather than Pex (cross-linked polyethylene)? reply 13of40 9 hours agorootparentprev> Lead roofing tends to get recycled into bullets in time of warThat&#x27;s interesting - I&#x27;ve read that there are a lot of castles and stately houses whose demise started from the owners selling off the lead roof, but I never understood why it would be so valuable that you&#x27;d destroy the building for it. Is that why? reply prewett 8 hours agorootparentQuite a number of British monastic churches and castles had their roofs sold off by Henry VIII, who was fully intending to destroy the building. reply CrazyPyroLinux 6 hours agorootparentprevHopefully you don&#x27;t have a fire....See: Notre Dame reply ironmagma 12 hours agorootparentprevThose don’t seem like comparables though. Lead is just one (or arguably a handful of) compounds, while there are at least dozens of species of plastic. reply Gigachad 9 hours agorootparentprevI highly doubt it. They don&#x27;t seem to be perfect, but they clearly aren&#x27;t anywhere near as toxic as lead. reply jacquesm 13 hours agorootparentprevPlastics for potable water tend to be copper lined where I live, not sure what is used elsewhere. reply tredre3 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve never heard of copper-lined PEX, can you tell me more? reply londons_explore 12 hours agorootparentI think op may be referring to &#x27;barrier pipe&#x27;, which is a plastic -copper-plastic sandwich, which is designed to keep out pollutants which can diffuse through the plastic - eg. Diesel oil.If you don&#x27;t use it for underground water pipes in cities, you&#x27;ll normally get complaints from homeowners about &#x27;chemical smelling&#x27; water, particularly first thing in the morning when water has been sitting stationary in pipes all night. reply fransje26 44 minutes agorootparentOooooohhhh.. That make sense. Today I learned. reply ClumsyPilot 11 hours agorootparentprevoh dear i forgot that plastics are permeable to petrochemicals lile paper is to water reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentprevI still have a length of it in storage but I don&#x27;t know the brand by heart. It was pretty expensive stuff and it needed weird fittings, which were also expensive, the inner liner was blue, that much I do recall. In the end I mostly regretted going for plastic, I&#x27;d probably use regular copper pipe and crimp fittings again, less hassle and I&#x27;m just more familiar with it. reply amluto 11 hours agorootparentDo you mean PEX-Al-PEX? It’s mostly obsolete now, in favor of “oxygen barrier” PEX. The latter is generally approved for potable use, but there’s no reason to use it. It’s intended for closed-loop heating or cooling systems that contain non-stainless iron alloys, and the idea is that any oxygen initially in the water will be rapidly depleted, and deoxygenated water is not corrosive. reply jtwaleson 2 hours agorootparentprevProbably alupex \"meerlagenbuis\"? Comparing it to copper it seems to be much more affordable per meter. I worked mostly with copper in the past, but did some work with alupex on my brother&#x27;s house a couple of years ago. It&#x27;s much more convenient and affordable than copper! replydatavirtue 10 hours agorootparentprevI recently fell in love with copper pipes. So many advantages, so easy to work with. Quick and nearly fool-proof.I tried introducing some stainless fixtures and did not have a good time with it.I&#x27;m not a pro by any means but I do all of my own plumbing and gas work in my house. Haven&#x27;t had one issue out of iron gas pipe or copper water lines. I was actually planning a pex install&#x2F;replacement, and I have worked with it in my camper, but I changed my mind after doing some more work with copper recently (replaced water pressure regulator). Waaaaay cheaper than messing with pex. reply sokoloff 10 hours agorootparentPeople often go to Pex because it&#x27;s way cheaper than copper. I use copper because the rest of my house supply is copper, soldering pipe is a skill that I have and enjoy using, there&#x27;s a slight anti-microbial action from copper, and I trust it to last longer than I have years left around. I sure don&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s cheaper, though. reply cperciva 5 hours agorootparentI know some plumbers recommend Pex because it fails catastrophically -- if you run a nail through a pipe you&#x27;ll know it -- whereas copper can have pinhole leaks which will slowly grow mold all over the inside of your wall without you noticing. reply nrdvana 7 hours agorootparentprevI had a house where a brand new copper line corroded and started leaking 2 years from installation, and I don&#x27;t mean at joints or anything, I mean the local water just ate right through the wall of the pipe. I switched to Pex and was fairly happy with it.I never did do the research to figure out what was up with the water, but similarly, when I tried inventing my own sump-pump sensor by dipping copper wire into the sump well, it ate the copper wires apart in 3 days. I tried again with stainless rods and discovered that there was about .05 Volt per inch deep I put the sensor, i.e. the stainless rod near the top of the well would be about 2V higher (or lower, don&#x27;t recall) than the stainless rod that ran to the bottom. Made it kind of annoying to design the circuit. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentI assume you have a well, not city water? Utilities generally try to adjust their water to be non-corrosive to copper.If I used well water or had another non-city source, I would do my best to keep copper out of the plumbing and I would minimize brass as well. Stainless steel and plastic, please. reply ComputerGuru 6 hours agorootparentprevLooked in to this seriously for a product some years back. Captured ping pong ball floating on the surface of the water hitting a physical limit switch is the way to go. Otherwise ultrasound. reply rsaxvc 5 hours agorootparentprevConvenient point for PEX: If copper pipes aren&#x27;t properly grounded they&#x27;ll tend to develop pinhole leaks within that timeframe. reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparentprevStainless and copper do not mix. See galvanic corrosion. reply jstarfish 13 hours agoparentprevI had no idea it was unsafe to drink from green garden hoses until it was pointed out by an RV salesman trying to sell me a white hose for potable water-- in my 20s. I thought he was full of shit, but I was proven wrong.Hot water lines can&#x27;t be the only loophole causing lead ingestion. reply jhallenworld 12 hours agorootparentInteresting, I had no idea (I thought only the fittings would have lead, but it&#x27;s the hose material):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toxicfreefuture.org&#x2F;press-room&#x2F;new-study-rates-best-... reply rightbyte 11 hours agorootparentDear mother no why? Why does the Home Depot garden hoose have 6.8% led in it ...All these small environmental dangers add up. And they are so hard to keep track of. I would never suspect a water hoose to contain led. Let alone 6.8%. reply jstarfish 10 hours agorootparentYep. The best part is: I loved drinking from green hoses as a kid (maybe it explains a lot about me now). Even when the hose was left in the sun, the water always tasted like a cool mountain spring...because lead has a sweet taste to it. I assume this also explains why small children eat leaded paint chips, and dogs love puddles of [unleaded] antifreeze runoff (they say they changed the formula, but it looks and smells inviting to me).The dangers really are hard to keep track of. It&#x27;s too easy to blame the consumer (didn&#x27;t you read the packaging for your new garden hose?). Now the threat is plastics, which requires a materials science degree to understand as a consumer. reply jstarfish 10 hours agorootparentprev> I thought only the fittings would have lead, but it&#x27;s the hose materialIt can be either, depending on context. (Being pedantic here just so nobody comes away thinking it can only be one or the other.)The guy who pointed it out to me was making a sales pitch for an RV, so the hose he was upselling was for potable water-- the fitting for it on the RV was presumably selected for potability as well. Connecting a white hose to the spigot on your house could mean you&#x27;re passing dirty water through a safe hose.To be real anal, with aquaculture you have to screen fittings for other metals too. Exposure to brass will kill pretty much everything in a saltwater tank. reply hinkley 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen I moved I did a search not only for garden hose without lead but also without phthalates and BPA. There are a few goodun’s out there. Expensive though, but I also have hose connections that don’t leak because tolerances and decent seals. reply georgeg23 11 hours agorootparentIn particular I would recommend the ELEY Garden Hose reply greedo 10 hours agorootparentEley makes really good (but expensive) stuff. It bugs me that they moved their production overseas though. I could understand if they were selling a $5 sprayer or $15 hose reel. I think they could still make a good profit if their stuff was made back in Nebraska. reply hinkley 6 hours agorootparentWater Right is about a third of the cost. I&#x27;ve left mine out in the sun for three years for one hose, four for the other.

I trust that my city&#x27;s tap water doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it. After all, I previously and many people still drink it without extra filtering, and it&#x27;s safe enough to do so.Relatedly, the standard technique in alcohol distillation is to discard the head because it contains toxic methanol. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;a1IruS1bKN8?t=672 reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparentBut alcohol isn&#x27;t the only thing that has a boiling point lower than water. replyraincole 14 hours agorootparentprevBut when I googled hot water tap the first images it showed were... uh...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sinks-taps.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018&#x2F;9&#x2F;21&#x2F;the-benefits-o... reply fsckboy 14 hours agorootparenthahaha ok, but that product is a hot-water heater built into your kitchen tap to do away with your hot water kettle.

It&#x27;s of much more uncertainty as house plumbing has changed. reply crote 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s because it is primarily a historical artifact[0]. Most modern plumbing heats water on-demand, which pretty much entirely avoids the risk of storage tank contamination or Legionella.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HfHgUu_8KgA reply callalex 10 hours agorootparentI wouldn’t consider on-demand heaters to be all that modern. Places that use on-demand water heaters are now at a disadvantage because it is much more challenging to switch away from fossil fuels over to electric. Tanks, especially with a heat pump, can provide all the heating a household needs through a standard 120V15A socket. For on demand electric water heating you’re looking at upgrading main panels to supply an additional 240V20A and even that will struggle to heat the water enough in some winter climates. reply Gigachad 9 hours agorootparentprevStorage tanks are extremely common in Australia, but they are run hot enough to kill anything and then get mixed with cold water to bring it back to the desired temp. reply mrguyorama 12 hours agorootparentprev>Most modern plumbing heats water on-demandWhere is this the case? These kind of things are extremely locational and here in the US it seems like 45 gallon hot water tanks are still the norm. We had a fad with \"on demand\" hot water heating but everyone gave up on it when the \"it saves you money\" part didn&#x27;t work so well. reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparentHere in Europe the money saving works really well. The issue is that you need a lot of power to heat on demand. Meaning natural gas. Having an electrical connection strong enough to heat water for a shower is rare. replyuoaei 14 hours agorootparentprevRestaurants are sometimes equipped with hot water lines from the water district and a filler tap right above or near the stove so that boiling water doesn&#x27;t take so long. reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentprevHot water heating is where it is allowed. Some houses have hot water heating which should never touch tap water and so lead won&#x27;t be a problem (well it might be to plumbers working on it).Lead is an amazing material, too bad it is toxic, because from a materials stand point it is very useful to put a little into many different metals to useful properties. reply refurb 9 hours agoparentprevWhat parts of a hot water supply line contain lead.

But this doesn&#x27;t come up that much because it is obviously bad for you, and there&#x27;s generally no good reason not to avoid exposure and not many people care about precisely how bad it is for you.But it&#x27;s weird that lead exposure has been dropping while the things it&#x27;s supposed to cause don&#x27;t seem to be decreasing in proportion to the lack of exposure. reply civilized 10 hours agorootparentMarginal negative impacts of lead diminish with increasing exposure, so studies showing higher sensitivities today are expected. reply Natsu 6 hours agorootparentThe idea that the effects should grow is hard to make sense of, because what&#x27;s grown is only the lead exposure gap between classes, not the IQ gap. So no change in IQ gap with a change in the lead gap means the lead effect is picking up on confounding, not becoming larger.It would have to do that be consistent with this claim that the sensitivities have gone up, unless both groups have trended down in lead levels non-linearly. reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agorootparentprev> estimates of lead&#x27;s harm seem to be rising even as exposure decreases, which should make people stop and think moreIs the effect size or confidence rising? The latter makes sense. We&#x27;re moving from a population systematically exposed to lead (no control) to one with lead-free kids for a change. reply Natsu 12 hours agorootparentEffect size, at least for harm to IQ:What is the effect of 1 μg of lead on IQ?Good studies from the different research eras can be used to illustrate how lead effect sizes have changed over time.Landrigan et al. (1975) represents the Early Era. In this study, there were 46 children in the high lead group and 78 in the control group. Their respective BLLs were 48.3 and 26.9 in 1972 and 40.5 and 26.5 in 1973, and they were 8.3 and 9.3 years old, respectively. So we have a gigantic 14 μg&#x2F;dL gap between these groups. The high lead group had an average IQ of 88.02 versus 92.88 for the low lead group, or a 4.86 point IQ gap, and thus a per μg effect of 0.35 IQ points.Baghurst et al. (1992) represents the Middle Era. In this study, there were 494 children who had IQ results, and they were divided into quartiles by BLLs. The mean concentrations of blood at assessment age were 6.6 μg&#x2F;dL for the lowest quartile, 10.1 for the second, 13.7 for the third, and 20.0 for the final one. Their IQs were 109.6, 107.7, 102.7, and 98.7, respectively. Going from the lowest to the highest lead exposure quartiles, we have a BLL difference of 13.4 μg&#x2F;dL and an IQ difference of 10.9 points. Going quartile to quartile, the effect of 1 μg of lead was 0.54 IQ points, 1.39 IQ points, and then 0.63 IQ points, with the aggregate (1 - 4) being 0.81 IQ points.Kim, Yu & Lee (2010) represents the the Modern Era. In this study, there were 302 children who were median-split by BLLs. The high BLL group had a mean BLL of 3.74 and the low BLL group had a mean of 1.92 with IQs of 106.4 and 110, respectively. These differences of 1.82 μg&#x2F;dL and 3.60 IQ points mean that the per μg&#x2F;dL IQ drop was 1.98 points. reply civilized 10 hours agorootparentThe figure in the article shows a diminishing marginal effect of increasing lead exposure, so this is all quite consistent with the theory.I sure am wondering how much of the late 20th century Flynn effect was due to diminishing lead poisoning. reply ern 5 hours agorootparentI sure am wondering how much of the late 20th century Flynn effect was due to diminishing lead poisoningGiven that the Flynn effect seemed to be strongest in the era of high-lead petrol and has dropped off, I can&#x27;t see how it could have had an effect reply hinkley 12 hours agorootparentprevYou think the effect of a toxin is a certain curve. A giant initiative to remove it is moderately successful, but the numbers in the population are not coming down as much as you expected.Is it that the toxin is correlated with another substance that is responsible for part of the harm? Is it corruption and the cleanups have been faked, leading to underreporting of exposure without underreporting of results? Or did you underestimate the harm at lower exposures (maybe because you underestimated the exposure of some of your subjects)?Science is hard. As is public policy. reply hinkley 8 hours agorootparentSheesh I can&#x27;t believe I missed one:Corruption caused the original numbers to be incorrect, leading to anchoring in subsequent experiments. reply highwaylights 14 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d be interested to know how someone can be sure that the cookware&#x2F;tableware&#x2F;cutlery in their home is safe.Is this a result of far lower standards in other places or just a result of that being the region that was tested for the report (the post doesn&#x27;t say, it just mentions that samples were collected from developing countries).This could very easily be a massive problem in the developed world too and you wouldn&#x27;t know from the report here. reply mrob 14 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s a study showing various levels of lead leaching into drinks from ceramic mugs found in the US:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foodsafetyandrisk.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186...Important quote: \"The estimated daily dose of lead exceeded the California Maximum Allowable Dose Level of 0.5 μg per day for one of the five mugs tested.\"Previous HN discussion:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29606600 reply nayuki 14 hours agorootparentI probably dodged this ceramic problem because I drink from borosilicate glass beakers.

I think it really surprised him someone was so interested and he was happy to share. reply Modified3019 14 hours agorootparentIt’s definitely a concern of mine, thanks for the heads up about that company.For those that aren’t aware, the primer in cartridges typically have lead styphnate, barium nitrate, and tetrazene, among other things. So even if your bullets have a complete copper jacket, you still get significant lead particulate exposure, especially indoors or with a suppressor with high back pressure. No idea if whatever smokeless powders are used are doped with something fun or not. Bullets with exposed lead have additional concerns, as the surface gets flash melted&#x2F;vaporized in addition to particles generated from barrel friction. This all adds up.Never clean guns&#x2F;suppressors with vinegar (acetic acid), because that just creates lead acetate, a highly bioavailabile form of lead that makes elemental lead look safe by comparison, and legally and morally requires proper hazardous waste disposal.Fortunately there are alternatives showing up now, including some with lead free primers, but damn if it isn’t expensive, and as expected copper&#x2F;zinc&#x2F;mild steel bullets have trouble competing with lead for performance because it comes down to mass. reply Exuma 12 hours agorootparentThe lead acetate thing is fun to research, I went down that rabbit hole once, not because I&#x27;d ever do it but I like watching other people do it.

Extended firing sessions should be followed by a shower and clothes change.Fortunately, the elemental lead in cast pellets&#x2F;bullets is not very bioavailable, however it&#x27;s still a good idea to minimize exposure. reply datavirtue 10 hours agorootparentprevThe lead jacket is always torn open and the barrel smeared with vaporized lead that comes flying out of the muzzle.

The trader bought 550k options yesterday for SPLK to hit $127&#x2F;share? Since that seemed highly unlikely they were only priced at $.04 each. but now that SPLK is at $145&#x2F;share they are worth $18 each? so that would be a profit of ~$10m? reply eastdakota 16 hours agoparentYes. The one bit you’re missing is that a call option is the right to buy a stock at a certain price typically on or before a certain date.To make the numbers simple, imagine a stock trades at $10&#x2F;share. If someone came to you and said: how much would you be willing to pay to have an option to buy the stock for $100&#x2F;share? The correct answer is: it depends. If it’s the right to buy the stock for $100&#x2F;share at any point over the next 10 years then that’s worth more than to buy the stock at $100&#x2F;share in the next day. A stock trading at $10 is unlikely to jump to $100 in a day so the option to by it for $100 is not worth much. It could happen, so it’s worth something. But it’s unlikely. So, again to make the numbers simple, let’s say it’s worth $0.01&#x2F;option to buy a stock at $100 in the next day when it’s trading at $10 today.Now imagine it’s the next day and the company with the $10 stock discovers the cure for cancer or invents time travel or perfects cold fusion. News breaks and now it’s trading at $1,000 per share. Now how much is the right to buy the stock at $100 per share worth? The answer is going to be something really close to, but maybe a small discount from, $1,000 (current value of the stock) - $100 (how much you pay based on the option) = $900. So what was worth $0.01 yesterday is worth $900 today.Let’s say you have $10,000 to invest. If you know in advance the news is going to break you can do two things to (probably illegally) try and profit from it.1. Buy 1,000 shares of the stock for $10&#x2F;share. 2. Buy 1,000,000 options to buy the stock for $100&#x2F;share tomorrow with each option costing $0.01.With strategy 1 you spend $10,000 to buy something that, after the news breaks, is worth $1,000,000. Not bad. But with strategy 2 you spend $10,000 to buy something that’s worth $900,000,000 after the news breaks.In both cases you’re likely to at least be investigated. And strategy 2 seems especially suspicious because the risk is so high and the non-illegal reasons for doing it are so few and far between. Very few reasons you’d buy a bunch of call options that only pay off if something causes a stock to move dramatically in 24 hours.Finally, while short-dated, out-of-the-money call options are not something many if anyone should be playing with, they’re just a different flavor of something very familiar. To put it in context a lot of HN readers will understand more intuitively: a call option is what you often receive when you get equity in a startup. It’s the right to purchase shares at a price (strike price) before a certain amount of time (typically 10 years). reply tptacek 15 hours agorootparentThis is great, and as good a place as any for the thread to sprawl from, so I&#x27;ll ask: it depends on how you know the stock is going to shoot up the next day, right? Trading on private information isn&#x27;t illegal, and there&#x27;s a huge variety of ways to acquire private information at varying levels of confidence, and in a sense the purpose of the markets is to aggregate everyone&#x27;s private information to estimate a price.So a scenario I&#x27;m curious about:Say you&#x27;re, like, an employee at DataDog, and you&#x27;re involved in a long-term M&A discussion with Cisco that you know is competitive (I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of witnessing one of these at Arbor Networks). Things are looking great, you&#x27;ve picked up a bunch of strong signals that Cisco is definitely going to make a move, and then: the talks fall apart.Knowing Cisco, you immediately reach the logical conclusion that they&#x27;re about to acquire your biggest competitor.You have no fiduciary duty to Splunk whatsoever. Cisco is, if anything, hostile. Buying Splunk options that are valuable only if Cisco acquires doesn&#x27;t impact DataDog at all.Have you violated insider trading laws if you buy the options? reply eastdakota 14 hours agorootparentThink the super unsatisfying answer is:¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯I think a lawyer would advise that that trade would come with a ton of risk. But the law isn’t clear. Generally, the SEC’s goal is to make sure markets are “fair.” What makes a market fair is hard to define.If you do a ton of work to launch satellites to fly over Walmart parking lots and then model the correlation of how full they are to what the company’s next earnings will be: that seems like you worked hard and earned an edge you can trade on without getting in trouble. Feels like anyone has a theoretically equal opportunity to do the same work you did and get the same trading edge. That feels fair.Your hypothetical feels less fair. Is it unfair? Maybe? So unfair that it’d be prosecuted? Probably depends on a number of things, including how much you made on the trade. At a minimum it’s an area of unsettled law. And you would almost certainly be in for serious scrutiny and a legal fight.Supposedly one idea for Google’s business model early on was that they should use search query data to trade equities. After they researched it they concluded it would be considered insider trading. Though it’s hard to distinguish from overhearing something on the train, which (not legal advice) generally has not been. Think the difference at some level is scale and intention. And, I’d guess, if you made it your business to ride the Acela every day between Greenwich and NYC, bought special hearing aides that let you better eavesdrop on conversations, and made significant profits trading on the information then you’d be more likely to be successfully prosecuted.But… how is that different from flying satellites over Walmart parking lots?¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯Sometimes the law is intentionally a bit unclear. Usually in areas like this where you care about a general concept of fairness and want some caution and buffer at the margins. reply kevinmchugh 14 hours agorootparentSo since you mention Wal-Mart. They have, probably, a better idea of Proctor&Gamble&#x27;s quarterly sales than anybody but P&G, right? Like Walmart makes some massive double digit percentage of sales of p&g products, and knows about it possibly in real-time. If I was some data analyst at Walmart,I couldn&#x27;t trade on that, that&#x27;s misappropriation. But Walmart could potentially spin up a hedge fund and trade (against) their suppliers, until their suppliers threaten to pull product, I think?Presumably there&#x27;s a contract between Walmart and p&g that they won&#x27;t trade in each other&#x27;s stocks, specifically to prevent this? reply eastdakota 5 hours agorootparent¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯ reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentprevThat framing makes a lot of sense, and does help square the difference between the \"satellite imaging of Wal-mart parking lots\" and \"trading on intel you got working bizdev at a tech company\".It&#x27;s funny how often \"we&#x27;ll trade equities on the information we generate as a byproduct\" comes up --- always briefly --- as a tech company business model.

I hadn&#x27;t read this, but my hypo is literally case (3). His answer: \"who knows?\". Excellent.In my hypo and his, the origin of the private information I&#x27;ve acquired is still business my employer has conducted, so there&#x27;s a better-than-baseline probability that the SEC would see this as misappropriation --- even if my employer wasn&#x27;t directly going to trade on this, or if it was hard to trace any harm to my employer, it&#x27;s still potentially not OK for me to profit from it. reply growse 13 hours agorootparentThe thing where it gets murky though is that the theft argument needs someone to be stolen from, or defrauded.In classical insider trading, the victims are the investors in the M&A target. I&#x27;m misappropriating MNPI about the target, so I&#x27;m essentially defrauding the target&#x27;s investors.In the \"shadow\" case, I think it&#x27;s a harder argument to make. If I work for a potential Cisco M&A target that falls through (as per the GPP), I&#x27;ve got, MNPI about my org, and probably MNPI relating to Cisco.

Free money if you&#x27;re on the correct side. reply reaperman 15 hours agorootparentSometimes its easier to trade the right to buy&#x2F;sell something than to trade the thing itself.It’s less obvious with stocks because there’s a pretty streamlined system for taking delivery of the stock ownership but with physical goods or real estate sometimes actually changing ownership triggers a lot of regulatory or tax or process things.For example, with real estate if you actually buy it you’ll need at minimum to get insurance to cover if any trespassers or workers get injured on the property. Lots of paperwork to transfer the title&#x2F;deed, and you might be on the hook to help sort out future title &#x2F; deed &#x2F; survey errors. But if you never own it you save the headache of all these things.For buying commodities you need a safe, regulated warehouse&#x2F;tank to store it, handle all the ohysical logistics, etc.By buying and selling the right to purchase the things you can delay the actual purchase until you find someone who can and wants to actually deal with the ownership of the thing. reply matsemann 4 hours agorootparentIt wasn&#x27;t really a question about options in general, but these specific options. If they are either basically free money for the seller, or suspicious trading by the buyer, why allow both sides to trade like this?The seller is basically stealing money from a \"sucker\", until they suddenly aren&#x27;t. No value in allowing those kind if bets, then. Where the seller either wins or claim fraud. Very one sided. reply nlh 15 hours agorootparentprevOptions are legal to sell because in MOST cases (where insider trading is not happening), selling call options is a nice way to get \"free money\" (*note not actually free) and facilitates hedging and liquidity in the market. It&#x27;s a financial product like any other.Let&#x27;s take a boring case -- that $10 stock is NOT going to $1000 tomorrow, they&#x27;re not finding a cure for cancer, etc. So 99.9999999&#x2F;100, if you sold someone the option for $.01, it&#x27;s going to expire worthless tomorrow. You have 1M shares, you sell the call options for 1M * $.01 = $10,000.You let some other people place bets on a thing that might (but probably won&#x27;t) happen, and you get $10,000 just for owning the stock. It&#x27;s like an interest payment (with some risk).If the thing DOES happen, you are taking a risk that you&#x27;ll have to sell your stock for slightly less than if you&#x27;d held it, so you&#x27;re giving up some potential gains.But in the long run, this is all priced out and balances out (in theory, in an efficient market). You get $10,000 in \"interest\" but are taking the risk that you might lose some upside in a black swan event, and the buyers are paying a nominal amount to take a bet on the other side. They might have spent $10k in order to possibly make a $billion -- those are risks that some people price and want to take (like a lottery). reply thisisit 15 hours agorootparentprevThe illegal part in this equation comes from the asymmetric nature of the bet. Not many sane people play naked way out of money options. 99% of the time it is a losing trade. It is like playing the lottery. Perfectly legal.

Nobody sane would have done that trade otherwise. So hopefully the SEC will investigate fully.

But with the acquisition, the stock had a catalyst and with the share price jumping to $145, those options gained a crap load of intrinsic value (basically the difference of $145 - $127).Now either the purchaser got really really lucky or had insider information that the acquisition was going to happen. The latter seems much more likely. reply myself248 14 hours agorootparent> without some catalyst eventMost subtle Cisco joke in the whole thread.

If my plan was to hold the stock long term, there&#x27;s no downside risk because if the stock goes down, I get to keep the cash (premium) from selling the calls. If it goes sideways or slightly up I get to keep it as well.The only \"downside\" is it goes up >10% in which case i&#x27;ve made that 10% + premium, but I&#x27;ve now had my stock taken away from me.In this case, I lose out on an additional 10% in upside because it went up 20% overnight. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 13 hours agorootparentThat still seems like a pretty good deal.

Since I bought them at $10, I&#x27;ve still made $4001 profit, but I&#x27;m still dissatisfied because I would have made $7500 if I hadn&#x27;t sold the call option.What you&#x27;re describing is what happens if I don&#x27;t already own those shares and the price skyrockets. If the counterparty exercises their $50 option when the current price is $85, then yes, I&#x27;m obligated to buy the shares at market price and sell for a total loss of ($STRIKE_PRICE * 100) - $5000 - 1. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 11 hours agorootparentprevClearly I am not an option trader, but so long as you own the option you are selling (covered) doesn’t that make your maximum loss the stock itself (+potential profit from the positive movement).

In fact, that&#x27;s almost all that matters.Insider trading is all about obligations.

The company and its shareholders are the ones who are harmed by insider trading, so if you&#x27;re entrusted with the info and trade then you&#x27;re basically breaching your duty to the company (or the chain of people who shared the info with you).

She has material information that the public does not. reply kasey_junk 13 hours agorootparentBut she&#x27;s not an insider.The common belief is that insider trading laws are about having data that the market doesn&#x27;t know. In the US that&#x27;s just not the basis for the law. In the US there is no expectation that everyone has the same information when trading. The expectation is that people who have a duty to the shareholders are not trading on any non public material information. If you don&#x27;t have a duty to the shareholders, it doesn&#x27;t matter how you trade.Is that the appropriate standard to hold congress people to? I don&#x27;t know, personally i think, no.

Scientists now know that several places in our solar system might have conditions suitable for life. One of these is Jupiter’s moon Europa, a fascinating world with a salty, subsurface ocean of liquid water—possibly twice as much as in all of Earth’s oceans combined. However, scientists had not confirmed if Europa’s ocean contained biologically essential chemicals, particularly carbon, the universal building block for life as we know it. Now, using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have found carbon on Europa’s surface, which likely originated in this ocean. The discovery signals a potentially habitable environment in the ocean of Europa. Europa (NIRCam Image) Full Article Jupiter’s moon Europa is one of a handful of worlds in our solar system that could potentially harbor conditions suitable for life. Previous research has shown that beneath its water-ice crust lies a salty ocean of liquid water with a rocky seafloor. However, planetary scientists had not confirmed if that ocean contained the chemicals needed for life, particularly carbon. Astronomers using data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have identified carbon dioxide in a specific region on the icy surface of Europa. Analysis indicates that this carbon likely originated in the subsurface ocean and was not delivered by meteorites or other external sources. Moreover, it was deposited on a geologically recent timescale. This discovery has important implications for the potential habitability of Europa’s ocean. “On Earth, life likes chemical diversity – the more diversity, the better. We’re carbon-based life. Understanding the chemistry of Europa’s ocean will help us determine whether it’s hostile to life as we know it, or if it might be a good place for life,” said Geronimo Villanueva of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of one of two independent papers describing the findings. “We now think that we have observational evidence that the carbon we see on Europa’s surface came from the ocean. That's not a trivial thing. Carbon is a biologically essential element,” added Samantha Trumbo of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, lead author of the second paper analyzing these data. NASA plans to launch its Europa Clipper spacecraft , which will perform dozens of close flybys of Europa to further investigate whether it could have conditions suitable for life, in October 2024. A Surface-Ocean Connection Webb finds that on Europa’s surface, carbon dioxide is most abundant in a region called Tara Regio – a geologically young area of generally resurfaced terrain known as “chaos terrain.” The surface ice has been disrupted, and there likely has been an exchange of material between the subsurface ocean and the icy surface. “Previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope show evidence for ocean-derived salt in Tara Regio,” explained Trumbo. “Now we’re seeing that carbon dioxide is heavily concentrated there as well. We think this implies that the carbon probably has its ultimate origin in the internal ocean.” “Scientists are debating how much Europa’s ocean connects to its surface. I think that question has been a big driver of Europa exploration,” said Villanueva. “This suggests that we may be able to learn some basic things about the ocean’s composition even before we drill through the ice to get the full picture.” Both teams identified the carbon dioxide using data from the integral field unit of Webb’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). This instrument mode provides spectra with a resolution of 200 x 200 miles (320 x 320 kilometers) on the surface of Europa, which has a diameter of 1,944 miles, allowing astronomers to determine where specific chemicals are located. Carbon dioxide isn’t stable on Europa’s surface. Therefore, the scientists say it’s likely that it was supplied on a geologically recent timescale – a conclusion bolstered by its concentration in a region of young terrain. “These observations only took a few minutes of the observatory’s time,” said Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, a Webb interdisciplinary scientist leading Webb’s Cycle 1 Guaranteed Time Observations of the solar system. “Even with this short period of time, we were able to do really big science. This work gives a first hint of all the amazing solar system science we’ll be able to do with Webb.” Searching for a Plume Villanueva’s team also looked for evidence of a plume of water vapor erupting from Europa’s surface. Researchers using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope reported tentative detections of plumes in 2013 , 2016 , and 2017 . However, finding definitive proof has been difficult. The new Webb data shows no evidence of plume activity, which allowed Villanueva’s team to set a strict upper limit on the rate of material potentially being ejected. The team stressed, however, that their non-detection does not rule out a plume. “There is always a possibility that these plumes are variable and that you can only see them at certain times. All we can say with 100% confidence is that we did not detect a plume at Europa when we made these observations with Webb,” said Hammel. These findings may help inform NASA’s Europa Clipper mission, as well as ESA’s (European Space Agency’s) upcoming Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE ). The two papers will be published in Science on September 21. The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency.

So far, we haven’t managed to create any new water, and just a tiny fraction of our water has managed to escape out into space. The only thing that changes is the form that water takes as it travels through the water cycle.Anyway interesting thought experiment. reply jychang 10 hours agoparentEvery once in a while, I get reminded that people don’t necessarily have a scientific background.1. Water molecules are not indivisible, of course. Many biological processes will rip apart hydrogen and oxygen, or combine them back together, and have been doing so for billions of years. Industrial processes do the same. So there’s plenty of “new water” from oxygen in the air, etc.2. New water&#x2F;oxygen&#x2F;hydrogen land on earth fairly regularly due to comets, which are usually slushy balls of ice. reply bmitc 3 hours agorootparent> Every once in a while, I get reminded that people don’t necessarily have a scientific background.This isn&#x27;t necessary for your point and detracts from an otherwise useful clarification. reply jimkleiber 3 hours agorootparentI find it helpful to remember. When covid was starting to spread I worried a lot about potential exponential growth and was confused why a lot of others didn&#x27;t seem so worried. While there may be many reasons, one that came to mind is that they may not have learned as much about exponential growth as I had in electrical and computer engineering and in working with startups. So it helped me to remember not everyone has the same education and experience that I do, that we&#x27;re all relatively ignorant, depending on the field. reply bmitc 3 hours agorootparentThere will always be people that don&#x27;t know what you know and vice versa.

Water just sitting in a glass is constantly creating and destroying hydronium and hydroxide ions, and bare protons. Not to mention the carbon dioxide that gets dissolved as carbonic acid which can dissociate to bicarbonate.On the other hand, its tough to talk about new water because under thermodynamics, all atoms of the same isotope at the same energy state are completely fungible, so it’s hard to say anything meaningful about the history of a molecule. reply rcpt 7 hours agorootparentIf a few water molecules are destroyed and replaced created over a long time then is it still the same glass of water? reply alex_young 6 hours agorootparentThe famous glass of Theseus’ water eh? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ship_of_Theseus reply labster 8 minutes agorootparentIs the Glass of Theseus half-full or half-empty? reply mensetmanusman 6 hours agorootparentprevNothing is ever the same at room temperature if you are counting atoms. reply adonovan 7 hours agorootparentprevTrue, but even Feynman talks about \"new photons\" when describing scattering. reply kcarter80 10 hours agorootparentprevAs a percentage of total water on earth, how many of the H2O molecules do you speculate came from comets or industrial processes?Same question for the biological processes you mention. reply foota 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not a scientist; but water is used in photosynthesis, which is probably the main chemical reaction it undergoes. [1] says that the C3 cycle consumes 120 GT of CO2 per year, that&#x27;s 2.7267×10^15 mols of CO2. C3 carbon fixation consumes one mol of H2O per mol of CO2, so that&#x27;s 2.7267×10^15 mols of H2O. That&#x27;s 5 * 10^13 liters. The USGS says there&#x27;s ~1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water on earth (who chose that unit?), compared to 50 cubic kilometers for the C3 fixation. That&#x27;s a lot of glasses, but not many oceans. Perhaps a bigger factor might be from back and forth reactions in the oceans and atmosphere, but I&#x27;m not sure how to estimate those (e.g., water converting between different acids or getting hit by light in the atmosphere).[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bio.libretexts.org&#x2F;Bookshelves&#x2F;Biochemistry&#x2F;Fundamen... reply ramraj07 8 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely more than a glass of water which was the original question anyway. reply tredre3 11 hours agoparentprev> The water on our Earth today is the same water that’s been here for nearly 5 billion years.We create tons of water as a byproduct of many industrial processes, that&#x27;s \"new\" water.

To get truly duplicate water it would need to find its partner(s, who knew water was poly), I suspect the odds are low :-) reply prawn 9 hours agorootparentprevWater of Theseus! reply namirez 9 hours agorootparentprevExcept water is H2O where the oxygen comes from plants and plants get it from water and the hydrogen comes from hydrocarbon fuels where the hydrogen comes from water again. So technically you can never create new water on Earth but you can bring in more from the space. reply buffington 8 hours agorootparent> Except water is H2O where the oxygen comes from plants and plants get it from water and the hydrogen comes from hydrocarbon fuels where the hydrogen comes from water againI&#x27;m not a chemist, so I may be totally wrong here, but does a water molecule \"care\" where the source of its oxygen and hydrogen come from? If you brought oxygen from space, and hydrogen from space, couldn&#x27;t you then create new water on Earth? reply globular-toast 3 hours agorootparentOf course it doesn&#x27;t care. Man... I&#x27;m not expecting everyone to be a chemist, I&#x27;m certainly not, but how do people on Hacker News not know this stuff? I ask this with genuine curiosity. How old are you and what&#x27;s your education?Even pop science fiction like The Martian covered this stuff.Again, I hope people don&#x27;t offended as people often do when their knowledge is questioned. You all know stuff that I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just surprised because I thought this was basic stuff everyone knows. reply nojvek 5 hours agoparentprevIt depends on your definition of creating new water.When we extract crude oil from ground, hydrogen is made as byproduct. Similar with other industrial processes. That hydrogen released in atmosphere burns with oxygen to make water.So one could say that is new water.The sun is a big hydrogen ball, and some of the big sun flares may bring new hydrogen atoms to Earth.

It just passes through our processes and will outlast us all. reply redundantly 8 hours agorootparentAnd I roll my eyes at comments like this.There&#x27;s a huge difference of usability between different water sources. You can&#x27;t irrigate your orchards with salt water from the ocean. You can&#x27;t bathe in waste water from most manufacturing plants. You can&#x27;t drink ground water that has been contaminated by fracking.There is a finite amount of potable water. There is a finite amount of usable water for agriculture. Pointing at all of the water on earth and acting as if it&#x27;s all immediately usable without significant, costly barriers is silly. reply postmodest 8 hours agorootparentprevYour sort of responses to climate alarms are always the most disingenuous.We are consuming water from places where it has been relatively static, at rates far beyond its natural replenishment rate. THAT&#x27;S the issue. Yes, this is a closed system, and the human circulatory system is a closed system. But it&#x27;s bad if you drain the blood from your brain faster than it is replenished. reply wddkcs 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s only bad if there aren&#x27;t undiscovered sources and&#x2F;or processes we can use in the future to produce more water.

I could possibly win the lottery one day, but I&#x27;m not going to live my life as if it&#x27;s guaranteed. reply wddkcs 3 hours agorootparentYour analogy is an extreme example of the principle I&#x27;m referencing. Taken to a similar extreme, your argument is that we should choose who lives and who dies, through the limitation of the resources required for growth. reply redundantly 6 hours agorootparentprevSaying there might be fixes for this in the future is also disingenuous.It&#x27;s like saying military burn pits are okay because there may be medical advancements in the future that can be used to treat afflicted soldiers. reply wddkcs 3 hours agorootparentArguing against optimism is arguing against the history of science. We have cures to diseases that were declared unavoidable divine judgements, we have achieved feats of engineering that would be unimaginable a century ago. I am not arguing for the deapoilation of the planet. We should preserve our resources as best we can. But future growth requires the usage of what resources we do have, in to achieve outcomes and efficiencies far better than we can imagine.I do agree though, if science wasn&#x27;t verifiable, it would sound like a pyramid scheme. reply BurningFrog 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not being disingenuous.

I&#x27;m not starting a flame war, I just make an observation (and as it happens, I&#x27;m a fellow Greek).Yes, the word “European” (inhabitant of Europe) is rooted on the Greek word Europē, Zeus&#x27; mythical mistress (one of many), after whom both the continent and the satellite were named, but is the “-ean” a proper transcription from Greek?Perhaps “Europaean” could be the better answer to the question we discuss; after all, in English the continent&#x27;s name is a modernized “Europe” while the satellite stays closer to the intermediate Latin as “Europa”, and since this discussion is in English, I feel that the difference in suffix justifies a different label for the inhabitants of the satellite. reply bbor 41 minutes agorootparentI think it was a joke, not a argument from authority as a greek :)That said, I think ChatGPT is right here: ...the term \"Europans\" seems the most appropriate choice for the inhabitants of the Jovian moon Europa.

Earth is currently about 630 million km from Europa (Webb is only 1.5 million km away from earth). Because the sine of theta is approximately equal to theta for values of theta near zero, you can get the diameter of a 0.1 arcsecond cone at x km from Earth by multiplying by 0.00000485 = sin(2pi&#x2F;3603600).0.10.00000485 * 630000000 = 305 kmThe article says the pixels are about 320 km, so the math works out pretty close (for astronomy).Those magnificent images of black holes and galaxies that are way more distant, but also way way bigger.

Then they’d need to essentially create a Kola Superdeep Borehole in the sky, and there’s no obvious reason to do that, especially since drilling down into rock would be easier, and certainly more lucrative. (ie there aren’t any valuable materials in ice). This is assuming they don’t discover a 15 km deep fissure, which seems unlikely because I don’t think individual fissures discovered are that deep, all fissures are transitory, and probably randomly distributed.

Humanity could see our moon and it still took us thousands of years to get there.Really they&#x27;d only do it if they managed indefinite population growth without poisoning their biosphere with waste products, and had to mine out the ice shell just for more living space.

SUPPORT DEMO LOGIN Products Solutions Pricing Partners Company Sign up ANDROID Android 14 adds support for using smartphones as a webcams Mishaal RahmanSeptember 20, 2023 Home Android Android 14 adds support for using smartphones as a webcams Conclusion Video conferencing platforms like Zoom and Google Meet exploded in popularity during the COVID era, but the webcam market struggled to keep up. The best webcams were hard to get or were too expensive, causing most people to turn to cheaper, more readily available webcams or their laptop’s integrated webcam. The camera in most smartphones offers significantly better image quality than the one found in the vast majority of webcams, though, so many people installed third-party software on their phones to turn them into webcams. Starting in Android 14, it may not be necessary to use a third-party app to turn your smartphone into a webcam for your PC, as that functionality is getting baked into the Android OS itself — though there’s a catch. When you plug an Android phone into a PC, you have the option to change the USB mode between file transfer/Android Auto (MTP), USB tethering (NCM), MIDI, or PTP. In Android 14, however, a new option can appear in USB Preferences: USB webcam. Selecting this option switches the USB mode to UVC (USB Video Class), provided the device supports it, turning your Android device into a standard USB webcam that other devices will recognize, including Windows, macOS, and Linux PCs, and possibly even other Android devices. Webcam support in Android 14 is not enabled out of the box, however. In order to enable it, four things are required: a Linux kernel config needs to be enabled, the UVC device needs to be configured, the USB HAL needs to be updated, and a new system app needs to be preloaded. Kernel config The Linux kernel config (CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_F_UVC) is necessary so that the Android device can be mounted as a UVC gadget. Fortunately, many devices upgrading to and nearly all devices launching with Android 14 will have a kernel with this config enabled. This is because it is enabled by default on Generic Kernel Image (GKI) versions starting from android12-5.10 and later, and devices launching with Android 12 or later on top of Linux kernel version 5.10 or higher are required to ship the GKI kernel. Because major kernel version upgrades are rare in the Android space and since the Google Requirements Freeze (GRF) program allows for older vendor implementations to still be certifiable, some devices upgrading to Android 14 won’t have kernels that support the USB webcam function. It’s hard to put together a list of such devices, so the best way to tell if your device is capable is to check its kernel version and whether the config is enabled. To check your device’s kernel version, run: adb shell “cat /proc/version” However, to actually verify that the kernel config is enabled, it’s necessary to run another command to see if “CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_F_UVC” appears in config.gz, a compressed copy of the configuration file used to build the kernel on the device. adb shell \"zcat /proc/config.gzgrep 'CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_F_UVC'\" For example, here is the output from a Galaxy Z Fold 5 running Android 13. Since it is using the android13-5.15 GKI and since “CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_F_UVC=y”, it should be capable of supporting the USB webcam feature once it’s upgraded to Android 14. That’s assuming, though, that the device meets the other prerequisites I mentioned before. Webcam Service app Within the Android 14 QPR1 beta for select Pixel devices is a new system app called “Webcam Service” (com.android.deviceaswebcam). This app relies on a shared library named libjni_deviceAsWebcam.so. This app and library are set to be included as part of Android 14’s upcoming source code release. The Webcam Service app implements the “DeviceAsWebcam” service that I previously reported would “[turn] an Android device into a webcam.” The service forwards camera frames to a /dev/video node that host devices can read from. SELinux policy dictates that only processes in the device_as_webcam domain, ie. only the Webcam Service system app, can access the /dev/video nodes. Thus, only the device maker and not any third-party can actually take advantage of Android 14’s native USB webcam support. How does the Webcam Service app actually know when to start forwarding camera frames? When the new “USB webcam” option in “USB Preferences” is toggled, the system broadcasts the android.hardware.usb.action.USB_STATE intent with the “connected” and “uvc” intent extras. Webcam Service has a receiver for this intent, which starts the system service if the “uvc” intent extra is set to “true” and the framework method android.hardware.usb#isUvcSupportEnabled() returns true. The method isUvcSupportEnabled() returns true when the system property “ro.usb.uvc.enabled” is set to true. This property must be set by the OEM at build time, and if it is not set, then “USB Preferences” won’t show the “USB webcam” option and Webcam Service won’t start. This property is only readable by system apps like Settings and the Webcam Service app. When the Webcam Service starts, a new notification is posted that lets the user configure the webcam. Tapping the notification opens a camera preview where the user can zoom in or out or change lenses. Under the hood, the Webcam Service app starts a foreground service to ensure it is kept alive by the system. It uses the Camera2 API and supports streaming at either 720p (1280x720) or 1080p (1920x1080p) resolutions. The webcam device appears on the connected host as “Android Webcam”. ConfigFS and USB HAL The exact encoding method, video parameters, and name displayed to the host depends on how the device maker sets up the UVC gadget using configfs. For example, on the Tensor-powered Pixel devices, Google’s UVC gadget function configuration can be found in the init.gs[101|201].usb.rc file located in /vendor/etc/init/hw. In addition, the device needs an updated USB HAL so that Android is able to switch USB modes to UVC when the option is selected in Settings. Due to the aforementioned GRF program, however, it’s likely that many devices upgrading to Android 14 won’t receive an updated USB HAL, meaning this feature won’t work. Conclusion It’s good to see Google implement native USB webcam functionality into Android. Assuming that the Webcam Service app will be available in AOSP as we expect, that means this feature can be picked up by any device maker that wishes to implement webcam functionality. Many will call this feature a clone of Apple’s “Continuity Camera”, but it’s worth noting that Android’s version works with multiple platforms. Any phone running Android 14 that meets the requirements mentioned in this article can be turned into a standard USB webcam that works with any PC, and that’s a big deal.

See here[2].You create source and recipient URLs and then it just automagically makes it all work via WebRTC. I was able to for example make a source that captured my VLC window and sent out the video and audio, and then two destination URLs which received the source video and audio, but also sent their own audio to one another. This meant we could hear and watch the movie but also talk to each other via our microphones. All within browsers.I&#x27;ve got no relation to this project besides thinking it&#x27;s really awesome.[1]: Used for streaming your computer online, e.g. on Twitch. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsproject.com&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.vdo.ninja&#x2F;master&#x2F;how-does-it-work reply w-ll 9 hours agoparentI mean if you have an iPhone and thats your only Apple device this looks cool, but its kinda crazy Macbooks still ship with 1080p cameras. Not the event this month, but i think the one before that they demoedd using your iphone as camera for facetime on the desktop. reply pnpnp 5 hours agorootparentI see this argument a lot, but it’s actually a pretty complex trade off.Screen size, target audience (1080p Zoom), cost, sensor size, and pixel size all come into play.You can pump numbers for the sake of it on paper, but the reality is that it’s very hard to cram a good image sensor into a laptop screen in an economic way. There’s unfortunately just not enough real estate as thin as they are.Meanwhile, phones are quite a bit thicker & cameras are a huge selling point. Plus, almost everyone has one. It makes sense that if you want higher quality video on your computer, you’d use the other device which has video higher up on the design priority list. reply munk-a 4 hours agorootparent> There’s unfortunately just not enough real estate as thin as they are.Darn, one piece of marketing BS getting in the way of other marketing BS. Yea, 1080p is plenty high res enough for your work meetings and family calls - but users don&#x27;t really care about the thin aspect, we care about weight. Getting better key depth on laptops in exchange for a modicum of extra width is a deal I&#x27;d take any day of the week... and that&#x27;d allow far better cooling engineering and for a few more bulky components. reply afiori 3 hours agorootparentIn the context of cameras thickness is of the screen, not of the laptop as a whole reply makeitdouble 34 minutes agorootparentThere is no physical restriction preventing the screen from getting thicker though. At the end of the day it&#x27;s a trade-off Apple is taking. reply OJFord 2 hours agorootparentprevI think that was just another example, since key depth obviously has nothing to do with camera image sensor resolution. reply matt-attack 2 hours agorootparentprevThey just need a thick camera like the iPhone 15 Pro but then just create a hole for it by the track pad. reply faeriechangling 8 hours agorootparentprevThe webcams are for videoconferencing. It’s pretty rare for videoconferencing to support better than 1080p30. Apple is not exactly shy about using mediocre parts when it won’t make a difference.What surprised me was how long Apple was on 720p. reply twobitshifter 7 hours agorootparentWell there’s more you can with more resolution than transmit a bigger picture. Try the iPad camera during FaceTime. That will pan and zoom the view to keep you in focus and it’s only made possible by good resolution and a wide angle camera. reply faeriechangling 7 hours agorootparentI’ve configured OBS to do this with a 4K camera with a wide angle lens I have, plugged into a laptop with a 1080p camera. Which is be better than any camera they could ever fit into a Mac due to the sensor size. I usually don’t turn this effect on because I find it’s a little distracting…The other issue I didn’t bring up is the form factor. Phones and tablets simply have more room for a webcam than the MacBook Pro screen and I don’t actually know anybody shipping a laptop with a built-in 4K webcam. Mind you that Apple could ship a better camera with its studio display but opts not to. reply pnpnp 5 hours agorootparentprevThe iPad also has a lot more room for camera hardware than a MacBook.

The Apple integration with the iphone and macbook is the most seamless setup I&#x27;ve seen so far but I&#x27;ve still gone back to just using the built in webcam because its too fiddly to put my phone up on the screen and occasionally have issues where it won&#x27;t connect.Phone as webcam just doesn&#x27;t seem like a long term solution, eventually built in webcams will be cheap and good enough. And tbh I find the built in one on the macbook to be bordering on good enough once you consider how compressed and tiny the output will be on the other persons screen. reply eshnil 7 hours agorootparent> eventually built in webcams will be cheap and good enoughWe&#x27;ve been waiting what, 15 years for this to happen? reply twobitshifter 7 hours agorootparentprevAs of last week, Apple now has FaceTime on Apple TV using an iPhone or iPad which is equally flawless in my test. reply xnx 9 hours agorootparentprevMVP to full product is definitely the bigger part of the work. In the environment of early COVID, I think an app that had some rough edges would&#x27;ve still been very useful. Perfect is the enemy of good and all that. Phone as webcam shouldn&#x27;t exist at all (how do you even mount it?), but somehow the video and audio quality on phones is still years ahead of what&#x27;s available on even high-end laptops. reply Gigachad 8 hours agorootparentRough edge apps have been around for years. I tried one that worked in the browser and could connect to OBS on your laptop, it was just too cumbersome though.Apple actually did come up with a good solution for mounting the phone. A small disk that connects to the iphone with magsafe and has a flip out tab that can hook on to the top of the macbook.

It&#x27;s not like you suddenly have no more use for video cameras or microphones. The \"king\" of cheap webcams is still Logitech CX920; anything better than that starts with a separate HDMI capture card and can cost up to an order of magnitude more.

I hate to be the guy having those \"hot takes\" or whatever, but hear me out for a sec:I didn&#x27;t get a cell phone until 2013. (Yes I used land lines until then.) It was a Nexus 4 (still love the grippy sides and sleek glass back). Every 2-3 years I traded up, all the way until Pixel 6.Tomorrow my first iPhone will be delivered. Why? A lot of reasons, but some are:- I can&#x27;t just plug my Google phone into an external display to mirror it. Uh, hello?? DisplayPort out is explicitly disabled in the source code with no reason given: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MishaalRahman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1189998588023234560 -- yet this works great in other phones.- I can&#x27;t access my text messages from my Android phone (without a separate app like SMS Backup & Restore) -- go ahead, try it. Yeah, do an adb backup. Maybe rooting your phone would give you access, but it&#x27;s impossible otherwise AFAIK. And I think rooting your phone deletes everything in the process.- I can&#x27;t access my phone backup. It&#x27;s ONLY stored on Google&#x27;s servers. The only way to even get close is to restore it to a phone. This is a physical device I bought and literally am holding in my hand but can&#x27;t access all the stuff on it! Did you know you can just plug in an iPhone into Windows or Macs and dump a backup to your computers? It&#x27;s all right there, text messages, system settings, contacts, photos, databases, EVERYTHING (except maybe hardware-protected keys). It&#x27;s amazing.- Do I even need to mention all the Google shenanigans? We all know what I&#x27;m talking about, right? The mess of messengers... the killing of various services, the lack of support, the stronger integration with ads and tracking.Apple&#x27;s not perfect either, but I feel like it&#x27;s worth a shot inside the walled garden for a bit. I like that some of these common sense things are not a problem with iOS:- Display out.- Accessing your own device.- Messaging that actually makes sense.- At least it feels like Apple cares about privacy; counterintuitively, I feel way more in control using Apple products than I do Google ones. reply moonchrome 11 hours agoparentI switch between both every few years, on iPhone 14 ATM.Honestly Android does a lot of things better - there&#x27;s so many stupid \"because Apple\" things on iOS. For example it&#x27;s impossible to tell the charging speed&#x2F;estimated charge time, I have a lot of charging bricks between places and I can&#x27;t tell if I picked an iPhone compatible fast charger&#x2F;cable or not ? Or when I have Chrome&#x2F;Firefox installed, highlight text and tap search the web - it takes me to Safari ? A lot of small annoyances like these where you can&#x27;t do anything about it because the OS is so closed down.Android is way more customisable, easier to side load stuff (like running GBA emulator on iPhone).

There are so many things that Android does well like notifications and typing (these two stood out to me on Apple - horrible implementations really, especially the latter) that it will always remain my primary driver.But yeah, if someone thinks that Android is not for them and Apple&#x27;s walled garden is worth entering then or vice versa then whatever floats your boat, I guess. reply rusk 30 minutes agorootparentTyping on iPhone is just such a bad joke. reply BoorishBears 3 hours agorootparentprevI was a devout Android user in the early days, I&#x27;ve launched Android based consumer products and I still use an iPhone.I always joke that when Android can handle a screen rotation without blanking the screen, I&#x27;ll switch back: It&#x27;s not about the actual blanking of course, it&#x27;ll just mean they finally ripped out a design tradeoff they made for a device with 256MB of RAM and just... never fixed.Android is full of decisions like that, like the horrible storage framework churn that randomly made a generation of devices dog slow as various terrible FUSE implementations.Decisions that are technical, but just end up affecting user experience every day you use the device. reply Vogtinator 2 hours agorootparent> I always joke that when Android can handle a screen rotation without blanking the screen, I&#x27;ll switch backNone of the Android phones I&#x27;ve used blank the screen, there&#x27;s a smooth animation. reply BoorishBears 2 hours agorootparentEvery single phone in existence running Android blanks the screen.It can be hidden by frankly disgusting animations where they do things like squish a screenshot of your current screen to hide it, but the literal UI is being tore down on every rotation.As you can imagine that&#x27;s a pain in the ass to deal with on the app side, and until relatively recently the framework did a poor job providing support for handling it all. It&#x27;s a very common cause of app crashes too.(To really get technical, apps can opt out of this... but doing so means you&#x27;d need to reimplement the entire view stack and rotation yourself, which doesn&#x27;t happen for anything but video games) reply Tade0 37 minutes agorootparentI know what you&#x27;re referring to but Apple made this experience worse by disabling rotation in iOS on the home screen altogether.Of course most people don&#x27;t notice because they unlock the phone with Face ID and usually don&#x27;t stay on the home screen for too long, but still - if you push the home button when in horizontal mode you&#x27;re presented to a rotated screen.As for RAM: I was surprised to note that my phone has in fact 4GB of it (always thought it was 2GB), because apps get suspended all the time. It appears that at least on Android that was a sound design decision. reply vetinari 50 minutes agorootparentprevMy several years old Samsung doesn&#x27;t blank the screen.Android indeed does tear down the activity and creates a new one with different rotation and size; but activity is not the framebuffer currently displaying.

Murena also sells some degoogled out-of-the-box with &#x2F;e&#x2F;. I also like having root adb access on these systems (which btw, gives you access to the sqlite sms database). Screen mirroring via DP alt mode over USB-C works out-of-the-box and you can enable Android&#x27;s \"desktop mode\", though it&#x27;s rather barebones and clearly experimental. Plus, Fairphone supports their phone for a long time, they are easy to repair, they can run mainline kernels (postmarketOS...), etc. Of course, any Android phone still depends on Google for the OS.I&#x27;m with you on a lot of complaints regarding Google, though switching to Apple would feel like trading one evil for another: I would absolutely not describe an Apple cellphone as \"mine\", nor \"accessing your own device\" sounds like something Apple provides. reply DavidPeiffer 11 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been using android phones since 2009 and am highly considering a switch to Apple for the next one.Along with the reasons you state, the ecosystem is really messy. I&#x27;ve bought Nexus&#x2F;Pixel phones for the last 10 years and continue to be bummed by their performance.Pixel 1 XL was fantastic, but after about 2 years the camera kept failing. 3+ seconds to load, and it would commonly crash. Ultimately the battery life degraded, and the replacement battery degraded within a couple months, so I moved on.The 3a fell out of my pocket and broke 2 months prior to the end of security updates. That was a decent phone overall, but not supported by Google as long as I would have liked.Pixel 6 Pro has been fine so far, but my wife has been having issues with her Pixel 5. Slow performance, unreliable cellular connectivity, etc.\"Don&#x27;t buy Pixel phones\" could be the lesson here, but alternatives are arguably more of a security nightmare. My experience with Galaxy phones has been that they&#x27;re preloaded with an incredible amount of junk that needs to be un-installed. With Pixel it&#x27;s exclusively Google apps, most of which can be removed. That gives a smaller privacy and security concern than having 30 different companies with their apps pre-loaded (and possibly not removable).> Apple&#x27;s no angel either IMO, but I feel like it&#x27;s worth a shot inside the walled garden for a bit.I&#x27;ve hated on Apple a lot over the years and am disappointed that switching platforms seems like the best move after all these years. reply antman123 10 hours agorootparentI made the switch two years ago and never looked back :) let me know if you have any lingering questions reply m_0x 8 hours agorootparentI really love android notification system (As a user, not as an android developer), are those still \"okay-ish\" in iOS? reply ttt3ts 11 hours agorootparentprevSoon as I can sideload another browser with real AdBlock I am switching.

It’s the biggest thing I miss from android. reply mardifoufs 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah I have been using android for every single phone I&#x27;ve ever had, but I don&#x27;t see the point once iOS allows sideloading. They have locked down android so much(I kind of understand why, but still) at this point that sideloading is pretty much the only difference now. So why go for android? reply 0x38B 10 hours agorootparentYou can side load apps, but need a Mac or a MacOS VM and XCode.

But for my daily driver life manager, it&#x27;s iPhone all the way. The integrations with HomeKit devices + Apple TV&#x27;s make my home incredibly smart, absolutely everything is mirrored onto my Macbook and iPads (a current gen mini, and a 2017 Pro that&#x27;s somehow still hanging in there despite being beat to shit every day for 6 years) without me lifting a damn finger, and when I do get around to upgrading, I plug them both in and all my shit is transferred over, and I blank the old one and send it to Apple for recycling.Like it&#x27;s cliche as hell, but it does all Just Work. Androids have caught up quite a bit in terms of power and the \"slickness\" that iOS got famous for, but at this point, I&#x27;m so deep into Apple&#x27;s ecosystem I&#x27;d have to replace damn near every piece of electronic kit in my house to really transfer back over.

It probably has at least 2-3 more years of security updates, so the longevity is better than many new androids. reply fauigerzigerk 1 hour agorootparentI have two phones that do the exact same things for me - iPhone 14 and Pixel 7a. Screens are almost the same size. Battery life is very similar. Both are fast for the things I use them for.iPhones typically get OS upgrades for 5 years. Pixel gets 3 years.My iPhone cost £849 including tax, which is £170 p.a. The Pixel was £449, working out to £150 p.a. So the Pixel is £20 cheaper per year.iPhone SE has a much smaller screen, too small to read comfortably. I don&#x27;t trust refurbished phones. So these options don&#x27;t matter to me. Far cheaper Android options don&#x27;t matter to me either because they typically have huge quality and security issues.For people who just keep using their phone for 5 years no matter what, Pixel would be £80 cheaper, but I think performance would no longer be on par in the later years given that the iPhone starts out with higher specs.I&#x27;m not saying this comparison is any more correct than yours. My point is that whether or not iPhone or Android phones are cheaper depends on how people use their phones. There is no one true answer to which one is cheaper. reply CalamityJohn 3 hours agorootparentprev> but iPhone’s really aren’t more expensive than androids, per year.> The 5g SE (2022) is $429iPhone absolutely are more expensive than any other phone if you care about things other than the CPU&#x2F;GPU performance.The 5g SE has a tiny screen with archaic bezel design and still uses LCDs in an era where not giving you an OLED would be seen as a ripoff on the android market. It starts at 64gb of storage for this $429 (in France, it&#x27;s actually 529 euros), my S20FE from a couple years ago which I bought at 400 euros on deals had 128gb. It has a very big, 120hz OLED screen and the finger print sensor works from underneath the screen.For me, and many others, the phone is primarily a content consumption device. If the CPU is good enough that I don&#x27;t see stutters all the time then it&#x27;s good enough. I don&#x27;t need my smartphone to be a laptop in the pocket. I do need a screen that I enjoy looking at and big enough that I can use it to read ebooks.This in turns is heavily reflected in how many Apple users will splurge the big bucks to get the iPhone models that are comfortable to use despite their insane prices. Right now, the cheapest phone Apple produces with a large screen is the iPhone 14 Plus at 969 euros.There&#x27;s a reason why the iPhone SE is the least popular of all Apple phones despite having far-more-than-good-enough hardware performance and longevity while being accessibly priced: it lacks what people actually wants out of their phone, Apple knows that and they keep the SE the way it is because they wouldn&#x27;t want to cannibalize the sales of the expensive phones. If you look at any statistics, the SE is like a rounding error compared to the sales of the other iPhones. reply BoorishBears 1 hour agorootparentSee, a lot of people are excited about Android 14, but the S20FE is already on security update-only status... meanwhile the iPhone 13 of the same vintage just got a major OS upgrade.And next year, when the S20FE won&#x27;t even have security updates, the 13 will get another major upgrade. And probably another after that._In fact, if you had bought a refurb $500 iPhone when the S20FE was announced (iPhone 11!), you&#x27;d still be getting into the new update the S20FE just missed out on.That is how absurdly abysmal Android support it: you could have gotten a 2 year older phone and actually gained an upgrade cycle.Also fun fact: the 2 year older iPhone 11 would also be faster than the S20 FE reply vetinari 13 minutes agorootparent1) iPhone 13 is 09&#x2F;2021; Galaxy S20 FE is 09&#x2F;2020. One year older device.2) System updates do not mean the same on Android and iOS. On Android, all the apps are going to be updated still. Browser, mail, chat, maps are not hostages to system update. Conversely, security-only updates on Android are perfectly fine. Most users would not see difference between major releases anyway. reply CalamityJohn 58 minutes agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t disagree with the update story being still a problem with Android, but iOS users tend to blow it up to a level higher than it actually is because they don&#x27;t understand how Android is segmented.You see, if Apple dropped support for your iPhone, you would never be able to ever get a browser upgrade again, since Safari&#x27;s engine updates are tied to iOS itself.Android doesn&#x27;t do that. Very old phones past their prime and past the security updates support will still receive the latest Chrome with latest web standards support and security fixes for itself (though it won&#x27;t stop other apps from being able to, say, exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability and other things of that vein). You will continue to receive upgraded Messages etc.Many of the APIs are updated independently too from the OS, through the Play Store, and because the developer community is aware of the OS update fragmentation, they also tend to target older SDKs for compatibility. So android phones are not becoming obsolete as fast as some Apple-exclusive users seem to believe from only being informed about \"android doesn&#x27;t get updates\".By the time my phone is truly done I will probably buy a new one because the battery will have worn out beyond my tolerance, as it always happens with these devices just as it happens on iPhones (I used to be on the iPhone camp when prices had not turned obscene, started with a 3g and ended with the 5s. No, I&#x27;m not paying $1k on a goddamn smartphone just because I prefer a bigger screen.).To remark on not being able to get 14: it&#x27;s sad, but I don&#x27;t really miss it. I&#x27;ve never used webcams in my entire life, and the other OS level features aren&#x27;t particularly important. IMHO, both iOS and Android have become mature as OSes and most of what people care about is in the app ecosystem, not what comes out of the factory. reply BoorishBears 43 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;ve launched AOSP devices professionally, so I understand how Android is segmented better than most...You spent way too many words trying to downplay some pretty simple facts: Android OS updates are what contain most headline features lay people recognize.GPS&#x2F;Mainline cover things that are implementation details as far as they know, and don&#x27;t cover the binary blobs which are the biggest reason why losing security updates in a year is going to mean the S20FE is forever an insecure device, regardless of what Mainline can deliver or what going with a custom rom does._Also Android is extremely far from mature, things like Project Mainline show we haven&#x27;t even settled on how far Google gets to sink the closed sourced claws of their GPS into the core of it.I mean you&#x27;ve got Android 14 finally adding the APIs to properly support scrolling on high FPS displays. Android had 120hz displays years before Apple and somehow manages to screw up these basic cases because they have no unified product vision to speak of.Maybe Android will be \"mature\" once Google is done with their iOS-ization of AOSP driven by crappy vendors, but for now the updates are extremely meaningful. reply askiiart 5 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re assuming 1) that people need a phone that fancy in the first place, and 2) that a phone&#x27;s life is up once it stops receiving updates.The Moto G6, and that stopped receiving updates long ago, and was released in 2018 for about $100. I don&#x27;t need much power, so I could easily get by with such an old, underpowered phone. I did for a while, but I did switch away because I was more phone-reliant at the time, and so an upgrade was needed. And I find the freedom of being able to install anything just from APKs, set another browser as my default, etc. as a huge value-add for Android.And yeah, the iPhone has more security updates, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me. I only install reputable, and mostly open source, apps on my phone so I&#x27;m not really concerned about security.So in terms of value: there&#x27;s the 2020 iPhone SE, with, say, 3 years left, for $120–$40 per year counting just the remaining years and using the current price at Walmart, or $300–$50 per year, assuming MSRP, a carrier discount of $100, and 6 years total. And the Moto G6, with just over of 5 years of life so far, and more value to me due to both the relative freedom of Android, and the fact that I&#x27;m used to and prefer Android, for $100–$20 per year. The choice seems obvious to me, for my purposes, but I can absolutely see why an iPhone is better for some people.By the way, fun fact: the Moto G6 has FM radio built-in!P.S. also, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d risk becoming one of those arseholes that tries to make their whole family get iPhones so they can FaceTime, just because they can&#x27;t figure out how to download another damn video calling app, despite being able to download all other apps just fine.

It has object recognition and creates small stories from pics of people, pets and certain days on which you took a few more pictures. I also like their new AI photo editor (Galaxy Enhance X).

You&#x27;ll have 6 years before your battery won&#x27;t last a whole day.If instead that +40% charge was going between 40% and 80%, the reduced strain might mean you only lose 5% of the total capacity each year. That would get you 8 years before your battery won&#x27;t last a whole day.Getting your battery to last longer like this also means that a year or two in, if there&#x27;s a day you expect to need the full capacity, you can just turn off the limit for that day and your battery will last longer than it would have if you never limited it. reply SobaniBanana 8 hours agorootparentprevcharging the phone all the way up to 100% is less efficient than just charging it to say 80&, it&#x27;s not linear.

First you have to have the connector; then your device needs to have a chipset that is capable of specific processing and protocols; and then it needs to actually implement those protocols with other things on the device. So your USB-C connector might only support USB 2.0, or 3.0, or 3.1, or 3.2, or 3.2 Gen1x2, or 3.2 Gen2x1, or 3.2 Gen2x2, and possibly PowerDelivery, and possibly video, and possibly audio, and possibly mass storage, and possibly ethernet, and possibly basically whatever feature you want.So you have to actually look up the specs of the device you have to find out what it will actually allow you to do over that USB-C cable. I bought a USB-C phone years ago only to find out it supported virtually nothing besides USB 3.0 file transfers, and a dumb charging standard proprietary to that one vendor.Samsung Galaxy phones do a ton of stuff over USB-C, including video out, and even DeX, where you can use the phone as a laptop. reply numpad0 10 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s just model dependent.

If you want any color grading or simply have deep shadows in the frame, MJPEG will make it look really bad. If you need chroma keying, it&#x27;s extremely sensitive to compression artifacts and chroma resolution. MJPEG blockiness is going to be amplified (and if you have noise then blocks will be flickering), you&#x27;ll be forced to wear a hat because it will cut your hair otherwise, and the edge of anything red (skintones, your shirt) will be smudged or terribly pixelated against the green screen. More expensive webcams like the Facecam Pro have the uncompressed or really high bitrate mode for this reason. reply gsich 2 hours agorootparent [–] This might be implementation dependent. MJPEG per se is not bad as you make it out to be.Example reviews: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=daS5RHVAl2U and many more. They all boil down to the same thing: excellent device, even with MJPEG. Obviously it&#x27;s more dependent on what you use as camera, than the encoding method. reply orbital-decay 1 hour agorootparent [–] I&#x27;m talking about webcams, which have more complex use cases than unprocessed game capture. MJPEG is necessary blocky and bad at low values (shadows); if you&#x27;re going to chat with friends, streaming it directly, it&#x27;s probably not going to be noticeable. But if you want to look good, any raw noise or any processing will amplify the compression artifacts, especially in the dark tones, and 4:2:0 will wreck the saturated reds against the opposite background.Take a look at this OBS forums thread I found, which is a pretty good illustration. [1] This is the best key from a cheap MJPEG webcam I&#x27;ve ever seen, usually it&#x27;s terrible and streamers have to wear hats. The edge quality in the final picture is still bad (especially hair), and that&#x27;s with unholy amount of polishing the turd he did, sacrificing latency and probably holding his breath (figuratively) to not go outside of his finely tuned setup. Especially the temporal noise reduction. Check this frame out as well [2], and pay attention to his shirt and hand - the edge is terribly pixelated, which he points out as well. And that is probably the best you can do with the crappy compressed source.This is the reason cameras like Facecam Pro exist at all. Uncompressed YUV with full chroma resolution makes it all far easier.> Obviously it&#x27;s more dependent on what you use as camera, than the encoding method.You can get away with a cheap camera, if you&#x27;re using it indoors with controlled lighting; you can&#x27;t get away with bad compression if you want to process it.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsproject.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;threads&#x2F;151600&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsproject.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;78631&#x2F; reply gsich 49 minutes agorootparent [–] >I&#x27;m talking about webcams, which have more complex use cases than unprocessed game capture.I am too. The HDMI capture card makes a webcam out of a DSLR&#x2F;DSLM. MJPEG is not the main issue when it comes to quality.This is still implementation dependent. MJPEG can range from 0-100 in terms of JPEG compression.

    "originBody": "Services Company Contact Sign in Subscribe The WebP 0day Early last week, Google released a new stable update for Chrome. The update included a single security fix that was reported by Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) team. The issue, CVE-2023-4863, was a heap buffer overflow in the WebP image library, and it had a familiar warning attached: \"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2023-4863 exists in the wild.\" This means that someone, somewhere, had been caught using an exploit for this vulnerability. But who discovered the vulnerability and how was it being used? How does the vulnerability work? Why wasn't it discovered earlier? And what sort of impact does an exploit like this have? There are still a lot of details that are missing, but this post attempts to explain what we know about the unusual circumstances of this bug, and provides a new technical analysis and proof-of-concept trigger for CVE-2023-4863 (\"the WebP 0day\"). This work was made possible by major technical contributions from @mistymntncop -- thank you! Unraveling the Timeline Immediately after the Chrome security update was released, experts began to speculate that there was a link between CVE-2023-4863 and an earlier CVE from Apple, CVE-2023-41064. The theory goes something like this. Early in September (exact date unknown), Citizen Lab detected suspicious behavior on the iPhone of \"an individual employed by a Washington DC-based civil society organization\": BLASTPASS: NSO Group iPhone Zero-Click, Zero-Day Exploit Captured in the Wild They attributed the behavior to a \"zero-click\" exploit for iMessage being used to deploy NSO group's Pegasus spyware, and sent their technical findings to Apple. Apple responded swiftly, and on September 7 they released a security bulletin that featured two new CVEs from the attack Citizen Lab identified. On each CVE they note: \"Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.\" Citizen Lab called this attack \"BLASTPASS\", since the attackers found a clever way to bypass the \"BlastDoor\" iMessage sandbox. We don't have the full technical details, but it looks like by bundling an image exploit in a PassKit attachment, the malicious image would be processed in a different, unsandboxed process. This corresponds to the first CVE that Apple released, CVE-2023-41061. But you'd still need an image exploit to take advantage of this situation, and indeed, the second CVE that Apple released is CVE-2023-41064, a buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageIO. ImageIO is Apple's image parsing framework. It will take a sequence of bytes and attempt to match the bytes to a suitable image decoder. Several different formats are supported, and ImageIO has been an active area of security research. We don't have any technical details about CVE-2023-41064 yet, so we don't know which image format it affects. But we do know that ImageIO recently began to support WebP files, and we know that on September 6 (one day before the iOS/macOS security bulletin), Apple's security team reported a WebP vulnerability to Chrome that was urgently patched (just 5 days after the initial report) and marked by Google as \"exploited in the wild\". Based on this, it seems likely that the BLASTPASS vulnerability and CVE-2023-4863 (\"the WebP 0day\") are the same bug. The WebP 0day -- Technical Analysis By cross-referencing the bug ID from Chrome's security bulletin with recent open source commits to the libwebp library code, it's possible to find the following patch: Fix OOB write in BuildHuffmanTable This patch was created on September 7 (one day after Apple's report), and corresponds to CVE-2023-4863. Based on an initial review of the patch, we learn the following: The vulnerability is in the \"lossless compression\" support for WebP, sometimes known as VP8L. A lossless image format can store and restore pixels with 100% accuracy, meaning that the image will be displayed with perfect accuracy. To achieve this, WebP uses an algorithm called Huffman coding. Although Huffman coding is conceptually based on a tree data structure, modern implementations have been optimized to use tables instead. The patch suggests that it was possible to overflow the Huffman table when decoding an untrusted image. Specifically, the vulnerable versions use memory allocations based on pre-calculated buffer sizes from a fixed table, and will then construct the Huffman tables directly into that allocation. The new version does a \"first pass\" construction that calculates the total size that the output table will require, but doesn't actually write the table to the buffer. If the total size is bigger than the pre-calculated buffer size, then a larger allocation is made. This is a great start, but it's non-constructive. We want to be able to construct an example file that can actually trigger the overflow, and to do that we have to understand how this code is actually working and why the pre-calculated buffer sizes weren't sufficient. Stepping back, what is the vulnerable code actually doing? When a WebP image is compressed in a lossless way, a frequency analysis of the input pixels is performed. The basic idea is that input values that occur more frequently can be assigned to a shorter sequence of output bits, and values that occur less frequently can be assigned to longer sequences of output bits. The real trick is that the output bits are cleverly chosen so that the decoder can always work out the length of that particular sequence -- i.e. it's always possible to disambiguate between a 2-bit code and a 3-bit code, and so on, and so the decoder always knows how many bits to consume. To achieve this, the compressed image has to include all of the statistical information about frequencies and code assignments, so that the decoder can reproduce the same mapping between codes and values. As mentioned, internally webp uses a table for this (they call it the \"huffman_table\")... but the tables themselves can be quite large, and including them alongside the compressed image would make the file size increase. The solution is to use Huffman coding to compress the tables as well. It's turtles all the way down. This means that there's a non-trivial amount of mental gymnastics involved in analyzing/triggering the bug. Based on a review of the patch, we can isolate the memory allocation that is the most likely candidate for being overflowed and come up with a plan. We're trying to overflow the huffman_tables allocation in ReadHuffmanCodes (src/dec/vp8l_dec.c), and the idea is to use the VP8LBuildHuffmanTable/BuildHuffmanTable call in ReadHuffmanCode (not the one in ReadHuffmanCodeLengths) to shift the huffman_table pointer past the pre-calculated buffer size. To add to the complexity, there's actually 5 different segments of the Huffman table, each with a different alphabet size (e.g. number of possible output symbols for that particular segment of the table) -- and we'll probably have to craft all 5 of those to get close enough to the end of the buffer to cause an overflow. At this point I had come up with a basic theory of how to proceed and started manually crafting a file that could reach this deep into the code, and around this time I started chatting with @mistymntncop. It turns out that they had also been attempting to reproduce this issue, and they had built harness code to create a well-formed WebP with arbitrary Huffman coding data (\"code lengths\"). I tried it out and it worked perfectly, we could pass arbitrary code_lengths array into the BuildHuffmanTable call that we were targeting. Brilliant. Now the challenge was to find a group of code_lengths that would make BuildHuffmanTable exceed the pre-calculated buffer size. I started with some manual experimentation -- changing the code_lengths array to affect the internal histogram (essentially the count array in BuildHuffmanTable), and then watching what affect each of the 16 histogram entries had on total_size, the key variable that we needed to increase to a larger than expected value. It quickly became clear that there was a complex interaction between the histogram's starting state, the tree statistics (num_open and num_nodes), and the \"key\" variable that tracks the starting location of the \"ReplicateValue\" operation that wrote entries into the output table that we're trying to overflow. It reminded me of watching the internal state of a cryptographic hash function, and without knowing a lot more about Huffman trees and WebP's specific implementation choices, I didn't feel confident that I'd be able to manually craft an input that would even be considered correct by BuildHuffmanTable, let alone one that makes BuildHuffmanTable return an unexpectedly large value. My next idea was to brute-force a solution. I had noticed that the first 9 entries in the histogram (e.g. count[0] .. count[8], which are called the \"root table\") wouldn't have much influence on the total_size, but could influence the internal state for subsequent computations (such as by pushing the number of nodes too high). The final entries in the histogram (e.g. count[9] .. count[15], which are called the \"second level tables\") had a direct effect on the final total_size value. With this in mind I created a few different statistical distributions that generally kept the values of the root table low (typically summing to less than 8) and the second level table higher. This approach managed to find correct inputs, and some of them resulted in output tables that were quite large, but still less than the pre-calculated buffer sizes. I decided I needed to understand how the pre-calculated sizes were derived. There are actually several different pre-calculated size buckets depending on the number of color cache bits that are specified. The buckets are defined in kTableSize, which includes a helpful description of the values and an invaluable tip: \"All values computed for 8-bit first level lookup with Mark Adler's tool: https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/v1.2.5/examples/enough.c\" The \"enough\" tool emits the histogram for the largest possible Huffman tree lookup table for any given alphabet size, root table size, and maximum code length. Using Mark Adler's tool, I could replicate the pre-calculated buffer sizes, and using @mistymntncop's tool I could verify that the specific code_lengths emitted by \"enough\" would 100% fill up the huffman_tables allocation. That's great, but the whole idea of a heap overflow would be to fill up the allocation to 101%... I followed a dead-end here, which is that the \"enough\" tool only works for color_cache sizes up to 8-bits. How did they derive the values for 9-bit, 10-bit, or 11-bit caches, all of which are considered valid? Maybe they just guessed and these values are wrong? I think Google must have modified \"enough\" to work on larger alphabet sizes, because I managed to replicate their numbers by making some minor changes to \"enough\" (things like using the 128-bit integer scalar type compiler extension to be able to count the number of trees without overflow). At this point there was a long process of angst. The \"enough\" tool is clear in its documentation that it calculates the maximum value for valid and complete codes. There must be some configuration of this input histogram that produces a tree that WebP considers to be valid and complete, but is actually incomplete/invalid in a way that produces a larger expansion than anticipated. The patch even hints in this direction, saying: \"make sure that valid (but unoptimized because of unbalanced codes) streams are still decodable\" In the end I managed to convince myself that this wasn't possible by enumerating all of the possible valid trees in the smallest of the tables (a symbol size of 40), which also happened to be the last of the 5 tables we needed to fill. The purported maximum size for a symbol size of 40 with a root table of 8-bits and a maximum code length of 15 is 410. If you can generate anything bigger than 410, then you win. But none of the codes that BuildHuffmanTable would consider valid had a size bigger than 410 (and most of them were much smaller). It seems like the consistency check at the end of BuildHuffmanTable, e.g. checking that the number of output nodes is an expected value, was ensuring that the codes it accepted were in line with \"enough\" and the pre-calculated buffer sizes it gave. But the BuildHuffmanTable function is writing values to the output table using the \"ReplicateValue\" operation mentioned earlier. What if we built 4 valid Huffman trees that resulted in 4 maximally sized output tables, and then supplied an invalid Huffman tree for the last table? Could we get ReplicateValue to write out-of-bounds from an invalid starting key prior to the final consistency check on the node count? The answer is: yes, we can.

In practice there are many such inputs that will overflow huffman_tables. I've found code lengths that result in writes as far as 400 bytes past the end of the huffman_tables allocation. Even with only partial control of the value being written, it definitely looks exploitable. To exploit this issue you would likely need to use the color cache bits (or num_htree_groups) to get a huffman_tables allocation that is roughly page aligned, but that shouldn't be a problem. It may be that there are other ways of causing an OOB write on the huffman_tables allocation, but this method looks like an acceptable approach. The invalid input itself is quite unusual -- mistymntncop provided the following visualization of the Huffman tree it creates using a tool they wrote to assist in this analysis: If you zoom in, you can see that the tree is partially unbalanced, and that a section of the unbalanced branch has a large number of internal nodes with no children in them at all. This structure results in a \"key\" index that a valid tree would never be able to reach. Here's what a valid tree looks like: As for the patch, it seems to work almost by accident. As mentioned earlier, the patched version does a first pass with BuildHuffmanTable to calculate the total size required. In practice, this issue is patched because BuildHuffmanTable will fail (return 0) for all of the invalid inputs that would otherwise have resulted in an out-of-bounds write, and since the first pass is explicitly not writing to the table, it doesn't matter that the invalid tree is partially processed. In other words, I thought the patch was dynamically increasing the size of the buffer as needed to prevent heap overflow, but it's actually just denying the inputs that would cause a heap overflow instead. It's definitely hard to reason about, but I searched for \"valid and complete\" codes that would still trigger this overflow, and I couldn't find any. So it looks like the patch should be sufficient. Early Discovery? Immediately after Chrome's security update, there was some discussion about fuzzing. A binary file format implemented by a C code library is an ideal target for fuzzing -- so why hadn't this bug been found earlier? Had the library not been fuzzed enough? Or had it not been fuzzed right? Google's OSS-Fuzz project has fuzzed hundreds of open source libraries for many years now, including libwebp and many other image decoding libraries. It's possible to look in full detail at the code coverage for OSS-Fuzz projects, and it's clear that lossless support for WebP was being fuzzed extensively: The problem, we now know, is that this format is incredibly complex and fragile, and the preconditions to trigger this issue are immense. Out of billions of possibilities, we have to construct a sequence of 4 valid Huffman tables that are maximally sized for two different alphabet sizes (280 and 256) before constructing a very specific type of invalid Huffman table for a third alphabet size (40). If a single bit is wrong at any stage, the image decoder throws an error and nothing bad happens. In fact one of the first things that Google did after the WebP 0day was fixed was to release a new fuzzer specifically for the Huffman routines in WebP. I tried running this fuzzer for a bit (with a bit of backporting required due to API changes) and it predictably did not find CVE-2023-4863. Perhaps I'm wrong and some of the newer techniques involving symbolic execution (like Quarkslab's TritonDSE) would be able to solve this -- but standard approaches based on bitflip mutations with a code-coverage feedback loop, and even slightly more sophisticated approaches like CmpLog (input-to-state), would not be able to navigate through all of these intermediary steps to reach this extremely pessimal state. It's interesting to contrast this bug with an earlier vulnerability, the Load_SBit_Png bug in FreeType, which was also discovered \"in the wild\" in an advanced 0day exploit. It's similar in the sense of being a heap overflow in a common library for a binary file format (for fonts in this instance) written in C, it's similar that it affected Chrome, and it's similar in the sense that FreeType had been heavily fuzzed in the months and years leading up to this attack. The difference was that the Load_SBit_Png bug wasn't found during fuzzing due to a lack of adequate harnessing, rather than some specific constraint of the vulnerability that made it difficult to fuzz. If the fuzzing harnesses had been updated earlier to better reflect the APIs usage, the Load_SBit_Png bug would have been discovered with fuzzing. That's not the case for the WebP 0day (CVE-2023-4863) -- unless, perhaps, you got incredibly lucky by having a file in your fuzzing corpus that was already extremely close to the bug and your fuzzer was very well calibrated in terms of its mutation rates. In practice, I suspect this bug was discovered through manual code review. In reviewing the code, you would see the huffman_tables allocation being made during header parsing of a VP8L file, so naturally you would look to see how it's used. You would then try to rationalize the lack of bounds checks on the huffman_tables allocation, and if you're persistent enough, you would progressively go deeper and deeper into the problem before realizing that the code was subtly broken. I suspect that most code auditors aren't that persistent though -- this Huffman code stuff is mind bending -- so I'm impressed. What's The Big Deal There's some good news, and some bad news. ✓ The good news is that the team at Citizen Lab has, once again, done an amazing job of catching a top tier exploit being used in the wild. They have cultivated a lot of trust with the organizations and individuals that are most likely to be harmed by exploits. It's very impressive. ✗ The bad news is that exploits like this continue to have societal ramifications, and we can only guess how bad the situation really is. The truth is that nobody knows for sure, even the people with exploits. ✓ The good news is that Apple and Chrome did an amazing job at responding to this issue with the urgency that it deserves. It looks like both groups pushed out an update to their billions of users in just a number of days. That's an impressive feat, it takes an incredible effort and coordination across threat analysis, security engineering, software engineering, product management, and testing teams to make this even remotely possible. ✗ The bad news is that Android is still likely affected. Similar to Apple's ImageIO, Android has a facility called the BitmapFactory that handles image decoding, and of course libwebp is supported. As of today, Android hasn't released a security bulletin that includes a fix for CVE-2023-4863 -- although the fix has been merged into AOSP. To put this in context: if this bug does affect Android, then it could potentially be turned into a remote exploit for apps like Signal and WhatsApp. I'd expect it to be fixed in the October bulletin. ✓ The good news is that the bug seems to be patched correctly in the upstream libwebp, and that patch is making its way to everywhere it should go. ✗ The bad news is that libwebp is used in a lot of places, and it could be a while until the patch reaches saturation. Also, the code is still very difficult to reason about, and we can't rely on fuzzers to find any other bugs that are lurking here. Final Thoughts The WebP 0day (CVE-2023-4863) is a subtle but powerful vulnerability in a widely used open source library that is highly exposed to attacker inputs. It's both very difficult to fuzz, and very difficult to manually trigger -- but the prize is an exploitable heap overflow that works on multiple browsers, operating systems, and applications. It's likely that CVE-2023-4863 is the same vulnerability used in the BLASTPASS attacks. I started this technical analysis shortly after releasing last week's blog post on Phineas Fisher, which means I was several days late to the party. In practice it took about 3 full work days worth of work (with a lot of additional help from @mistymntncop) to figure out the bug and build a reproducing testcase. The lack of available technical information from the vendors here made verification challenging, and it's questionable who this really benefits. Attackers are clearly highly motivated to track and exploit N-day vulnerabilities, and the lack of technical details being released won't significantly slow them down. On the other hand, very few defenders are resourced to be able to perform the type of technical analysis I've shared today. It's counter-intuitive, but withholding basic technical details about how these attacks are working in an asymmetry that mostly benefits attackers -- you quickly end up in a situation where attackers have access to insights about the vulnerability/exploit that defenders don't have. This bug also shows that we have an over-reliance on fuzzing for security assurance of complex parser code. Fuzzing is great, but we know that there are many serious security issues that aren't easy to fuzz. For sensitive attack surfaces like image decoding (zero-click remote exploit attack surface), there needs to 1) be a bigger investment in proactive source code reviews, and 2) a renewed focus on ensuring these parsers are adequately sandboxed. Finally, thanks again to @mistymntncop for both their encouragement and huge technical contributions to this post. Ben Hawkes Sep 21, 2023 ← Previous Isosceles Blog © 2023. Powered by Ghost",

Timsort particularly maintains a stack of sorted runs, and due to the construction there is a small enough finite limit in the maximum possible stack size. However the original CPython implementation didn&#x27;t exactly match what was proven, so there were rare cases where stack overflow could happen. So this was a serious security bug in CPython, but wasn&#x27;t in OpenJDK because Java instead threw an exception in that case.Similarly, this WebP bug occurred because the largest table size was formally proven but it didn&#x27;t match what was fed to the source code. This kind of bugs is not only hard to verify but also hard to review, because of course there is a proof and the source code seems to match the proof, so it should be okay! This bug suggests strong needs for approachable formal verification, including the use of memory-safe languages (type systems can be regarded as a weak form of formal verification), not human reviews.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;envisage-project.eu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;sortin... reply tialaramex 2 hours agoparentSpecifically, since performance is crucial for this type of work, it should be written in WUFFS.

Unlike most formal verification projects that I&#x27;ve seen, the proof part of Wuffs isn&#x27;t about correctness (proving that \"this implementation satisfies the PNG specification\"), it&#x27;s about safety (proving that \"this implementation won&#x27;t read&#x2F;write out of bounds\"), which is much more tractable. Especially as the PNG spec (or WebP spec) doesn&#x27;t mandate how to treat malicious input (like unbalanced Huffman tables).Wuffs doesn&#x27;t have a WebP decoder yet but it&#x27;s literally in the Roadmap and I&#x27;ve previously written the golang.org&#x2F;x&#x2F;image&#x2F;webp package in the Go programming language.Wuffs does have a PNG decoder, PNG uses Deflate compression and Deflate and WebP&#x27;s \"decode a Huffman tree\" data tables are very similar. Wuffs also has an equivalent of zlib&#x27;s enough.c program mentioned in the original blog post to calculate worst-case memory requirements. Wuffs&#x27; version is called script&#x2F;print-deflate-huff-table-size.go and it says that, for a 9-bit primary table, we need 852 table entries. Round that up to 1024, for nearest power-of-two.If you look for HUFFS_TABLE_SIZE = 1024 and HUFFS_TABLE_MASK = 1023 in Wuffs&#x27; std&#x2F;deflate source code, you&#x27;ll notice that Wuffs&#x27; Deflate decoder isn&#x27;t susceptible to the same problem as the C&#x2F;C++ WebP decoder the original blog post discussed. This is because, unless the Wuffs compiler can prove otherwise, the code doesn&#x27;t just look up the table like `this.huffs[0][i]`, it&#x27;s like `this.huffs[0][i&mask]` and `i&mask` is always in bounds. The mask is either HUFFS_TABLE_MASK or it&#x27;s of a refinement type guaranteedthis WebP bug occurred because the largest table size was formally proven but it didn&#x27;t match what was fed to the source codeWith WebP+enough.c this &#x27;largest table size&#x27; was calculated by exhaustive, brute-force search (not really a formal proof) but it was based on assumptions (balanced codes) that didn&#x27;t match actual (malicious) input. Or, in zlib-the-library, there&#x27;s other C code (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;madler&#x2F;zlib&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ac8f12c97d1afd9bafa9c710...) that rejects unbalanced Huffman codes, but IIUC similar enforcement was (until very recently) missing in libwebp.With Wuffs, even if the worst-case calculation was based on an incorrect model (or forgetting to separately reject unbalanced codes), the end result (on malicious input) might be \"the wrong pixels\" but it shouldn&#x27;t be \"buffer overflow\". reply lifthrasiir 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, Wuffs can be classified as memory-safe languages in this case and should be endorsed as much as possible. I mean, I said a lot about the limitation of Wuffs in the last conversation, but that&#x27;s because I believe something like Wuffs should be used more widely, and the current limitation of Wuffs can hinder the progress.

Many of these do a commendable job of following security updates in Chromium (like Brave), but others tend to fall quite far behind (like Samsung&#x27;s SBrowser).Chrome desktop was affected as well, both on Linux and Windows. Chrome bundles its own version of libwebp, so even if your Linux distribution hasn&#x27;t patched yet, as long as Chrome is up-to-date you should be OK (in terms of browser attacks at least).There&#x27;s lots of wonderfully obscure image file formats that are supported by the major browsers and operating systems.

Everything that supports WebP is affected. Not just Chrome and Electron, but all browsers, desktop and mobile, and non-browser software too. All kinds of image viewers, graphics programs, email clients, even your file manager that shows thumbnails.The bug is in the codec library, and WebP has implementation monoculture, so everyone uses the same library, and everyone needs to patch.3. Google tried to make WebP a thing 10 years ago, but it didn&#x27;t get much traction, since it was Chrome-only for a long time. It never got properly standardized (it is open source tho).

These types of exploits are in very high demand for Android right now, I&#x27;ve heard some eye-watering prices being mentioned recently.Updating Chrome on an unsupported device would fix the issue, but you would still need an Android OS upgrade to fix the issue for apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Chrome bundles its own version of libwebp, but messaging apps and other highly exposed stuff like Gmail all use the OS provided interfaces for displaying images.

These days iMessage itself is probably more tightly sandboxed than other apps.It sounds like the exploit was triggered in another process by iMessage forwarding the post-parse attachment content to that process - the blog post says this is passkit related so I assume any app that has passkit interaction could do this. iMessage is simply universally available so why use a different medium. reply userbinator 5 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s surprising that this isn&#x27;t in a \"newer\" part of the image format; Huffman compression has been around for over 70 years, Canonical Huffman for a few decades less, but even JPEG uses Huffman. This is a decades-old technology that should&#x27;ve had the bugs worked out of its many implementations by now and there are also countless articles about how to implement it.I&#x27;ve read the JPEG spec (and written a decoder) before, so I decided to look at the WebP spec: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;speed&#x2F;webp&#x2F;docs&#x2F;webp_lossless_...The important information is in section 6. The first thing I notice is that it&#x27;s not very clear how the codes are constructed, unlike the JPEG one (which actually has a ton of very readable flowcharts on the process), but it appears to be similar to LZH&#x2F;deflate(zlib). The \"specification\" looks more like a selected set of source code fragments with accompanying descriptions.Perhaps I should try writing a WebP decoder too, having already done GIF, JPEG, and PNG, but based on the above \"specification\", it&#x27;s almost as if they don&#x27;t want you to. reply lifthrasiir 5 hours agoparent> it&#x27;s not very clear how the codes are constructedI agree the specification really lacks examples, but it explicitly states that it uses canonical Huffman trees so that only code lengths have to be transmitted. I think this is clear enough to pinpoint the actual tree.

It is Google that assigned this as Chrome only. Over the last 7 days alone every single major Linux distribution has had to push an update (including Red Hat which assigned this a 9.6 score), and Docker images like Python which has over 1 billion pulls, not to mention Puppeteer(hello?), WordPress, Node.js, etc. and CRBug is still private to this day.I am not being condescending but sites like BleepingComputer reported this as they saw it rather than doing any investigation. And the same goes for a lot of security companies that reported on this issue in third person. It’s really difficult to foster trust when you know that the person on the other side hasn’t bothered to do any due diligence.Adam Caudill (1Password was one of the first to patch it) did a nice blog post, “Whose CVE is it anyway?”[0] highlighting the issue I am talking about in my comment.Citizen Lab has refused to comment on whether both are related, but it doesn’t take a genius does it…[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamcaudill.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;whose-cve-is-it-anyway&#x2F; reply Yeroc 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;m surprised the summary of the article only talked about over-reliance on fuzzing and then suggested 1) more thorough code reviews and 2) sandboxing as solutions?! To me, the solution lies in using memory-safe languages. reply nolist_policy 13 hours agoparentI think sandboxing is the more powerful solution. You think in terms of \"What privileges can the attacker gain if this code blows up?\" and limit the code&#x27;s privileges to the minimum.Problem is, sandboxing is harder to implement so it&#x27;s often done suboptimally or not at all. reply Yeroc 13 hours agorootparentYes and Google Chrome has invested heavily in sandboxing and still had to ship this as a high-priority fix. I&#x27;d say sandboxing in conjunction with memory-safe languages is the future. reply kentonv 12 hours agorootparentThe problem is that rewriting existing code into a memory-safe language is a huge investment -- and realistically the world depends on a lot of code built over many decades that cannot be rewritten overnight. Consider that Mozilla created Rust specifically so they could rewrite their browser in it, yet still only a small fraction of Firefox code is Rust today -- much more is still C&#x2F;C++. Realistically we&#x27;re going to have a lot of heavily used C&#x2F;C++ code forever. The singularity will come before we can replace it all.The nice thing about sandboxing and fuzzing can be applied to existing code. reply Yeroc 12 hours agorootparentYes, but sandboxing and fuzzing are insufficient. As pointed out in the article Google had been fuzzing this library and it didn&#x27;t find the issue. They even tweaked the fuzzing after this issue was found to specifically target the area of the vulnerability and it apparently still didn&#x27;t trigger the issue.Google Chrome also implements sandboxing and many areas. It&#x27;s not feasible everywhere. So for new code &#x2F; libraries we should default to a memory-safe language. reply kentonv 12 hours agorootparentI think almost everyone agrees new greenfield projects should not choose C&#x2F;C++, now that Rust has matured enough and covers essentially the same use cases.But realistically that only solves a tiny fraction of the problem, since realistically new greenfield projects started today will likely take 10+ years to become widely used, if they do at all.WebP was written at a time when C&#x2F;C++ was still the only viable language in which to write an image compression library. Saying \"things like this should be written in Rust!\" just doesn&#x27;t actually do anything to make software like WebP secure. Improving fuzzers and sandboxing might. reply est31 11 hours agorootparent> realistically new greenfield projects started today will likely take 10+ years to become widely used, if they do at all.I&#x27;m pretty sure that even now a lot speaks against using rust for greenfield projects precisely for that reason: few people want to integrate Rust into their build chain. You basically always have to have a compiler that&#x27;s 1 release old or otherwise you cannot compile new Rust software like the very widely used time crate.If you are a new and unproven format, do you really want to bear that hit? You could make two implementations, one in C and one in Rust, but that will mean you spread your probably quite scarce engineers over two projects. reply kentonv 11 hours agorootparentHeh. Well, speaking as the lead engineer of a large C++ systems project that sadly started a liiiiitle bit to early to use Rust (the Cloudflare Workers runtime), I&#x27;d say our attitude is the other way around: We basically refuse to bring in any kind of C&#x2F;C++ dependency unless it&#x27;s something used in Chrome (implying they&#x27;ve vetted it). We are much more willing to bring in Rust dependencies, even though they&#x27;re harder for us to invoke due to the language barrier. reply est31 47 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s a really good policy, and what I said above does not reflect my private opinion but the opinions of a lot of people that decoder projects target. You are in a way more controlled environment.For dav1d I heard that one of the reasons why C was chosen was precisely this portability concern. format decoders are usually quite low level components and can get integrated into all sorts of environments. I&#x27;m sure there is someone out there who made a visual studio project with a 3 year old VS version with dav1d inside for some embedded project.

For trusted code (e.g. not third party code), sandboxing is a post-exploit mitigation. And such a post-exploit mitigation cannot necessarily guard against any class of bugs that (at least in some aspect) provably correct code can.Yes, of course privilege separation as much as possible is still extremely valuable, but to say that sandboxing is a \"better\" solution, implying that one should not pursue provable correct code in favor of post-exploit mitigation, is a harsh liability.

So you still need a sandboxing layer. Best to do both.(The sandbox will have bugs too. But if you have two layers, hopefully it&#x27;s hard for attackers to get ahold of zero days for both at the same time...) reply anyfoo 2 hours agorootparentYeah, anything can be implemented incorrectly. My point was specifically that ignoring memory safe languages in favor of post-exploit mitigation is foolish, not that the latter is useless.But in practice, type systems can be proven to be sound, implementations of type checkers can be proven correct, and while it’s still possible to make mistakes there, that isn’t so much an issue in mathematics, simply because of how rigorous it is. This does not just include type systems, there’s even an effort to rebase the foundation of mathematics on a type system instead of set theory!In other words, we likely agree that steel vaults can have holes.

The trusted kernel for these systems is tiny; a sandbox is orders of magnitude more complex with orders of magnitude more chances for bugs to creep in. reply 0x53 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat does provably correct mean here? I think you mean that the code doesn’t have any memory corruption vulnerabilities. However, that is only one class of vulnerability, so more techniques then just relying on a memory safe language are required for secure software. reply anyfoo 2 hours agorootparentIt means that the type system can prove certain properties for you. For example, in languages with dependent type systems like Agda, you can construct a sorted list type that the compiler will prove it sorted at all times, otherwise it won’t compile. Or a complex tree type that is always balanced. Or a set of only even numbers, and again it won’t compile otherwise…(Sadly, if you go that far, it isn’t generally Turing complete anymore. Though in some cases that’s a good thing.) reply littlestymaar 2 hours agorootparentprevSecond problem: sandbox aren&#x27;t perfect either. It&#x27;s indeed useful, as part of a defense-in-depth approach, but it&#x27;s far from sufficient.Memory safety could solve the problem altogether, but then again no program is 100% memory safe, there&#x27;s always some kind of primitive that uses memory-unsafe code under the hood, so it&#x27;s not perfect either.The “perfect” solution would probably be:- use memory safe languages- all primitives using memory unsafe stuff should get formally verifiedRust is kind of aiming at this (with things like [1] and [2]), but it&#x27;s not there yet.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3158154 [2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-secure-code&#x2F;safety-dance reply spookie 13 hours agoparentprevUsing memory safe languages may help, but the core issue lies on the lack of understanding of the program as a whole.

I&#x27;d argue that expressive ML-style typing is if anything more important than memory safety, although it&#x27;s hard to tell since a type-safe language will almost always have to be memory-safe. reply anyfoo 2 hours agorootparentI never claimed all memory safe languages are type safe. But memory safety is a subset of type safety. Whether dynamic or static (though I’m much in the latter camp), memory safety is achieved through information associated with the types. Whether that’s exposed to the surface or not: Rust exposes it and is static, Haskell normally does not expose it and is also static, most modern dynamic languages are memory safe but don’t expose the associated information. reply lmm 2 hours agorootparent> But memory safety is a subset of type safety. Whether dynamic or static (though I’m much in the latter camp), memory safety is achieved through information associated with the types.Nah. Dynamic languages don&#x27;t actually have types (even if they have something that they call types), and even typed-but-GCed languages often don&#x27;t really use the types for memory safety. reply anyfoo 2 hours agorootparentThey have value types. The expressions don’t have types (or rather very general types), but the values do, and it’s still possible to have a dynamic language with very rigorous value types that have a well-defined set of inhabitants.Any dynamic language that has a string type has something similar to (for example) a buffer and a length associated with it internally. You can formalize that from the compiler’s perspective, even if you don’t expose it to the outside.You could argue that the language doesn’t necessarily have memory safety associated with its types, because a compliant compiler or interpreter could represent strings in any way it chooses, and on some academic level there’s merit to that, but in practice you’d be rather stupid to implement the string value type in an interpreter or compiler for a language with a common string type in a memory unsafe way. replykeyle 8 hours agoprevMillions of people in the world are affected by this library, 10 times over for every devices and apps they use.I&#x27;m sorry but I call for libraries used by millions around the world to NOT use C.

A disposable VM with nothing of value in it for \"casual web use\" seems the right option for exploring the security hostile environment of \"the internet.\" reply chatmasta 11 hours agoparentSure, that might help you on your desktop. But this exploit was only discovered because of a zero-click iOS exploit, where the payload was encoded in an iMessage attachment that opened in Passkit, which rendered the WebP file. (In fact the user didn&#x27;t even need to \"open\" the attachment - just receiving the message was sufficient to trigger the exploit.)So Qubes won&#x27;t help you everywhere, and the WebP decoder is everywhere. reply cogman10 13 hours agoparentprevUnless you are making a vm per page refresh, I can&#x27;t really see how a browser in the VM is any safer than a browser outside the VM.My most valuable stuff (passwords, bank accounts, logins) is accessible from the browser. You&#x27;d need to somehow sandbox and frequently destroy&#x2F;restore the rendering and javascript engine to avoid leaking this information cross site while having a fairly strict firewall between those and the external browser. (IE: cookie&#x2F;session&#x2F;password storage). reply Syonyk 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not \"a browser in a VM.\"It&#x27;s \"A range of VMs, with different browsers in them, for different purposes.\"My \"random web use\" browser VMs don&#x27;t have anything in them - they&#x27;re ephemeral. If I need a password, I copy it from another VM over. If you escape into that VM, you might be able to grab a password being pasted, but I don&#x27;t access anything I consider sensitive in them - just random forum accounts, etc. And it&#x27;s easy enough to spin up other disposable VMs for stuff in Qubes (I actually mostly browse through the Tor network, to add traffic to it).So, for your use case, you&#x27;d have one VM with your \"core\" stuff - passwords, logged in to webmail, banking. And then you do everything else web related in a different VM. reply cogman10 13 hours agorootparentAh, makes sense.Probably a good solution for the highly technical, not something I could ever propose to my mother. reply halJordan 13 hours agorootparentI mean your mother is successfully using Apple&#x27;s highly sophisticated sandboxes and things like authenticated pointers.

Not to mention how frequently I&#x27;d get called due to slowness as she neglects to close the VMs. And say goodbye to remote support options unless she gives me SSH to dom0 but then why do any of this anyway at that point? reply jwells89 8 hours agorootparentMy bet is that over time most people would slip on the separation and end up with tons of tabs in the wrong containers. The only way it&#x27;d work in the long term is if there were some way of automatically taking link clicks in the \"wrong\" container, thoroughly sanitizing them, and then tossing them over the \"right\" container but then you&#x27;re back to risking cross-contamination. replybennyg 14 hours agoparentprevThis is a fun idea, are there any browsers that hide the VM from end users so it looks and feels like a browser instance but is actually a tunnel into a sandboxed VM that’s being painted to? reply Chabsff 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s kinda-sorta what they all do already. Not full OS-level VM abstraction, but surprisingly close to it. Exploits like this need to be paired with sandbox-escaping in order to do damage beyond the current browsing session (which VMs wouldn&#x27;t help with in the first place).

At the same time, my Amiga 3000 running AmigaDOS 3.2.2 could support webp by virtue of an operating system-wide datatype plugin for webp.Updating the OS-wide datatype means all apps are updated, not just the browser. Why is this STILL not the case on supposedly modern OSes these days? reply kalleboo 19 minutes agoparentIIRC, in the early days Safari would pass off any image type to the OS, but after some TIFF vulnerability they whitelisted it to supported \"web\" formats.They also used to let you just embed a Quartz Composer file which let you do some \"fun\" stuff with the webcam that would terrify users. reply pornel 12 hours agoparentprevThe reason is most likely security and stability. OS vendors don&#x27;t want every application to be potentially vulnerable or unstable, because user installed some dubious codec pack.One place where macOS allows arbitrary codecs is Quicklook plugins, but these are designed to run in a separate process. It&#x27;d be wise to implement image codecs the same way, but so far they&#x27;re typically a library linked in the same process. reply arp242 12 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t really want this to be the case. Remember when Firefox accidentally exposed all gstreamer plugins to the web?Having some insecure unaudited badly written codec is fine for a lot of use cases because it operates on trusted data.

Its localized value will primarily be displayed to users whose preferred languages have a short word describing the relationship.But it ALSO needs at least some comprehensible localization in EVERY language, because I can send you a vcard for myself labeling this specific type of cousin (because that’s how I think of her), and I don’t know in advance what languages you use.The primary customer of this family of constants is a localizer, who by virtue of localizing Apple software needs to know English, but may not read or understand Chinese.The constant embeds everything that an English-speaking localizer needs to explain the relationship in a different language. That’s why something like the proposal here[0] (just use the Chinese name for this relationship) would not be an improvement.A fully generic DSL to describe relationships wouldn’t help localizers know which relationships are actually used in the real world.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28716546 reply lifthrasiir 6 hours agoparent> The constant embeds everything that an English-speaking localizer needs to explain the relationship in a different language. That’s why something like the [proposal] (just use the Chinese name for this relationship) would not be an improvement.I don&#x27;t exactly agree. Note that this constant embeds two terms, exactly because this particular kinship term does not distinguish them. In the other word this constant can only reasonably used in the Chinese kinship system, and others will be confused regardless of whether it&#x27;s translated or not. The reasonable UI should group such labels into some dedicated section like \"Extended families (Chinese system)\" so that they don&#x27;t need to be translated literally. Same for other kinship systems, of course. reply klausa 43 minutes agorootparentYou, and many people here keep assuming that this is a feature that is unique to Chinese language and&#x2F;or kinship system.It&#x27;s the main one that English speakers are probably exposed to; but even in this thread there are mentions of other languages and cultures where this or similar relationships have specific terms and more generic ones like \"cousin\" simply don&#x27;t exist.Grouping them all under \"Chinese system\" is... let&#x27;s say culturally insensitive._That_ is a reason enough to not use the term from any specific language as a constant name; let enough to not expose that in the UI to users. reply ljm 5 hours agorootparentprevCustom fields that are important in some cultures and not others would sound reasonable, compared to trying to account for all of it in code.That’s what databases are for after all. You can’t encode every possible version of a familial relationship as a constant. reply tromp 2 hours agorootparentprev> this particular kinship term does not distinguish themThen why not call it CNLabelContactRelationYoungerCousinParentsSiblingsDaughter ? reply layer8 42 minutes agorootparentBecause that would include father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter, which the Chinese term apparently excludes, hence it then wouldn’t be correct to localize it to the Chinese term. reply lifthrasiir 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure the actual translator would be able to connect that label constant to the Chinese term 表妹. reply ralferoo 1 hour agorootparentprevI think this UI issue shows a problem in thinking about what the actual problem is that they&#x27;re trying to solve.This bug is about contact cards, and so the relationship is necessarily between you and the contact. So, it&#x27;s not like you need to translate 表妹 into English, or differentiate it from 表姐 in English, as it&#x27;s something you have chosen to describe the relationship. If you just think of them as \"cousin\" or whatever you use in your language, that&#x27;s fine, just use that label. But, once you&#x27;ve assigned e.g. 表妹 to a contact, you don&#x27;t need to translate that to English if you change your locale... because you already know what it means, because you chose it in the first place!Admittedly, there&#x27;s an issue when you receive a contact from someone else, but then you will probably be changing that field anyway. Unless we are family, you sending me a contact for your aunt is unlikely to also be my aunt, and if it is, well I probably also share that native language with you. I&#x27;m sure there are edge cases, like siblings who were separated when very young and the parents moved to different countries, or adopted, or found via DNA testing or whatever. But even in those few contexts, learning about the word or having the person themselves explaining the relationship to you, probably helps overall understanding of the relationship.In any case, a lot of the Chinese words for the various familial relationships are quite amorphous. I remember being very surprised when a Chinese friend posted some photos on Wechat of her 孙子, literally \"son&#x27;s son\". My initial reaction was \"She can&#x27;t be old enough to have a grandson!\" then \"Wait? She has a son? I thought she was single...\" Turns out, she was referring to her brother&#x27;s son. Lots of people use 哥, 弟弟, 妹妹, 姐姐 (literally older brother, younger brother, younger sister, older sister) to mean their friendship group, although this is probably a result of the impact of the one child policy. 阿姨 and 叔叔 (aunt and uncle) are just respectful terms for people of similar age to your parents, etc. There&#x27;s literally no point trying to translate these names into their literal English meaning, because it will just further confuse people.So, then the big problem becomes where these labels come from. Is it a dropdown box where only the options available in your current language are presented? How do you then choose one that&#x27;s available in a different language if that&#x27;s what you want to use? Presumably these aren&#x27;t translated too literally into other languages, as e.g. an English speaker isn&#x27;t going to want to choose one of 4 options for \"cousin\", and hopefully would be immediately suspicious of why their phone wants that much information about the nature of their cousin-ness, when it&#x27;s customary to just use a single word. How then would that get translated back into Chinese? It would be embarrassing at family events if someone saw that the male cousin on my mum&#x27;s side was labelled as female cousin on my dad&#x27;s side.I think it&#x27;d be much easier if you could just type what you wanted into this relationship field, maybe with a drop-down or auto-complete for likely options in your language. reply klausa 42 minutes agorootparent>I think it&#x27;d be much easier if you could just type what you wanted into this relationship field, maybe with a drop-down or auto-complete for likely options in your language.Congratulations, you reinvented the exact UI for this that already exists in iOS from first principles. reply phearnot 1 hour agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s actually a relation between two contacts, not between you and the contact. The UI allows the user to link several contacts, e.g. link the \"spouse\" or \"brother\" contact to your friend&#x27;s contact card. There&#x27;s a set of predefined labels to choose from, and there&#x27;s also an option to add a custom label. reply watwut 3 hours agorootparentprevThat kinda sounds like more complexity rather then less for \"labeling translation system\". reply mawadev 3 hours agoparentprevI was not aware of the complexity of this until now. Thank you for your insight and write up. reply jes5199 7 hours agoparentprevare there multiple languages that have this exact relationship concept? because if it’s in a single language or family of languages, the idea that it can be translates into something generic seems questionable reply abdullahkhalids 5 hours agorootparentUrdu has even more discretization. Transliterated into latin characters* Mother&#x27;s brother = mamoo* Mother&#x27;s sister = khala* Father&#x27;s older brother = Taaya* Father&#x27;s younger brother = Chacho* Father&#x27;s sister = PhupoEach of these&#x27;s spouse also has a corresponding word. For example, Father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband will be Phupa.Then, their children are identified with a suffix.Mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son = Mamoo zaad bhaiMother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter = Mamoo zaad behanEtc. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentHuh!

A few examples:Mor = motherFar = fatherBror = brotherMorfar = mother&#x27;s fatherFarfar = father&#x27;s fatherFarmor = father&#x27;s motherFarfar = father&#x27;s fatherFarbror = father&#x27;s brotherMorbror = mother&#x27;s brother... reply lubutu 4 hours agorootparentThe same is true in Norwegian, but then they go and ruin it all with \"oldemor\" = \"great grandmother\", instead of persisting with e.g. \"mormormor\". reply ochrist 59 minutes agorootparentThe mother of the oldemor is called tipoldemor, and after that you just add as many tips as you need (in Danish but probably also in Norwegian). reply kitd 3 hours agorootparentprevIn the midnight hour, she cried .... reply Sporktacular 1 hour agorootparentNice. reply mgrund 3 hours agorootparentprevAt least in danish, we have “bedstemor” which behaves likes “oldemor” in being the mother or fathers mom so it’s really that form that is consistent with the system and not the parent-specific forms. reply ochrist 1 hour agorootparentprevWe use the same in Danish, but also uses:Faster = fathers sisterMoster = mothers sisterYou can also use tante (aunt) about theseA farbror or morbror is often called an onkel (uncle). reply 3836293648 12 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s still in Swedish, covered by the ... reply blablablerg 5 hours agorootparentprevBrorbror.. your brother&#x27;s brother? reply xyproto 59 minutes agorootparentBrorbror and brorbrorbror could be any of the brothers, including yourself. reply onionisafruit 4 hours agorootparentprevMy other brother Darryl reply flangola7 6 hours agorootparentprevLike what? English already has all the \"twice removed\" and other definitions that no one actually uses. reply eitland 5 hours agorootparentI am fairly sure English doesn&#x27;t have (or at least does not use) separate everyday words for farmor&#x2F;farfar (fathers mother &#x2F; fathers mother) or mormor&#x2F;morfar (same for mothers parents).Sure in academic language there is probably a way to describe it (edit: and the concept is easy to explain) but there is nothing quick that you can use to tell a kid so they immediately know which of the grandparents we are going to visit without naming them or the location they live in somehow?Even among the words that do exist, like \"siblings\", I have a feeling that in some dialects or sociolects it isn&#x27;t used and people say \"brothers and sisters\" instead. (I&#x27;m not sure about this last one but I have worked with a lot of English and American people over the years and it does feel this way). reply eterm 3 hours agorootparentEnglish has \"Paternal grandmother\" and \"Maternal grandmother\" for example, it&#x27;s just not often used and isn&#x27;t turned into a compound word. reply hervature 5 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t tell if this is serious. I don&#x27;t even know which language you&#x27;re using but it is literally no different than mom&#x27;s mom and dad&#x27;s mom other than a space. reply eitland 5 hours agorootparentIt is Norwegian. And it is serious.And I am not saying the concept doesn&#x27;t exist, only that as far as I am aware there is no usable everyday word for it.I mean: nobody will tell their kids they are going to visit dads mum and dads dad next week, rather than telling them they are going to visit grandma and granddad \"across the country\" or something? reply mjochim 2 hours agorootparentThings like this can be highly family-specific. A friend of mine (German) says that in his family, his grandmothers are distinguished as \"Oma\" and \"Omi\". Which are both generic German words for any grandmother, but in his family, they are more specific. Like names. Another friend, they used \"Oma\" and \"Großmutter\" (a third generic word) to distinguish the two.So there must certainly be families in the English-speaking world where kids commonly say \"dad&#x27;s dad\" and \"mom&#x27;s dad\". Even when unlike in Scandinavian languages, it&#x27;s not the canonical form. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentprev\"What are you doing this weekend, little Timmy?\"\"One is repairing to the country where one will be enjoying the company of one&#x27;s paternal grandmama and grandpapa.\" reply mendigou 4 hours agorootparentprevThe point of the conversation is how people express these relationships in their day-to-day so they can be encoded in software.Would your grandparents&#x27; contact be saved on your phone as \"Mom&#x27;s mom\" or as \"grandma\"? Probably the second, which is indistinguishable from \"grandma\" as \"Dad&#x27;s mom\".In Norwegian, people would naturally call these \"mormor\" and \"farmor\" and they would expect that relationship to be correctly labeled in their localized app. reply kalleboo 4 hours agorootparentAt least in Swedish, I don&#x27;t even think there is a generic word for \"grandmother\", you literally always in every case specify which one it is. reply Brybry 2 hours agorootparentprevFor day-to-day familiar conversation we generally use nicknames for grandparents in the US and that&#x27;s what is in our contact list.There are probably hundreds or thousands of nickname words for grandma based on a variety of cultural backgrounds, family tradition, and mispronunciations by grandchildren.The language we use really depends on setting. In a more formal setting we might say paternal grandmother&#x2F;grandparent. Speaking to a friend we might use the nickname, or we might say the ambiguous &#x27;grandma&#x27; or we might say &#x27;grandmother on my dad&#x27;s side&#x27; or &#x27;dad&#x27;s mom&#x27;.It really depends on the situation and familiarity and formality. reply hervature 2 hours agorootparentprevI am fully aware of what the topic is about. I&#x27;m just pointing out that the English language and native English speakers definitely use the concept of mom&#x27;s mom and dad&#x27;s mom without the needing \"official\" words like \"momdad\" and \"dadmom\" because the person I responded to said> I am fairly sure English doesn&#x27;t have (or at least does not use) separate everyday words for farmor&#x2F;farfar.They then said you would need \"academic\" language to describe mom&#x27;s mom and dad&#x27;s mom. That&#x27;s why I said I could not tell if they were serious. Anyway, I think you would be surprised if you asked English speakers what they call their grandparents. I personally used memere and grandma to distinguish between my mom&#x27;s mom and my dad&#x27;s mom. The point I&#x27;m making is that not having specific words for these relationships does not make English speakers unaware of the difference. reply Jensson 4 hours agorootparentprevThere is no \"grandmother\" in Swedish, you just have mormor and farmor. That makes a huge difference with how you have to use the language, you can&#x27;t say \"do you have a grandparent\" since there is no word for grandparent, you will have to say \"do you have any mom or father parents\". reply throwaway290 5 hours agorootparentprevThe space makes the difference between \"word exists\" and \"word doesn&#x27;t exist\". reply eitland 5 hours agorootparentI would have accepted it if it was something people would actually say, even if it was written like two words or more. Example: sister&#x2F;brother in law is something that is close enough even if it isn&#x27;t written in one word like Norwegian svigerinne&#x2F;svoger.But as far as I am aware English only uses grandsomething (or variations of it) + further description as needed. reply afiori 4 hours agorootparentPaternal grandmother, paternal grandfather, maternal grandmother, and maternal grandfather reply Agentlien 4 hours agorootparentThere is a big difference, though. In English you would usually say grandma&#x2F;grandpa and rarely qualify by on which side.In Swedish and Norwegian you always specify because the words for grandparents are inherent specific to whether they are paternal or maternal. reply afiori 2 hours agorootparentIn everyday speech you generally do not try to be this specific, but if you wanted to (e.g. recounting family history to a doctor or talking about the relationship between your parents and granparents) you could use them to be more specific in a clear way.I agree that almost every use of farfar should be simply translated as grandmother. reply watwut 3 hours agorootparentprevEnglish speaking people do not use these all that often. They say \"grandmother\" or \"grandfather\". They specify which side of family these come from only when they really need it for some reason.Unlike those other languages we talk about. replydavidgay 5 hours agorootparentprevNot Armenian, but, e.g., Bulgarian has a distinct name for the relation of two husbands of (not in-law) sisters. In English, that&#x27;s just one of the \"brother in-law\" cases.On the whole, Bulgarian has far more such relationship words than English. replymercutio2 10 hours agoprevIf you are a native English speaker and are surprised a relationship label might translate with difficulty into another language&#x2F;culture, consider:Brother-in-lawIt’s my sibling’s husband, OR my spouse’s brother.In many non-English-speaking cultures, that juxtaposition appears bizarre. reply jojobas 1 hour agoparent>In many non-English-speaking cultures, that juxtaposition appears bizarre.It only scratches the surface of how something very natural in one culture is bizarre or even abhorrent in another.Promised wives?

First, her family and all families she knew well only had a single child for generations; if that’s the case for most people, the population would shrink rapidly, so obviously most families aren’t like that.

But I guess comparing it to something like Nigerian where all friends&#x2F;family of an equal level are \"brother\"&#x2F;\"sister\" or higher level \"aunty\"&#x2F;\"uncle\", it seems weird to see English flattened so much. The language is specific to level (grand), node depth (x removed) and colinears (brother, sister, cousin, 2nd cousin, etc) that you can accurately describe pretty much any lineage.When you compare it like that, it gets the author&#x27;s point across even better to show how the language and culture play into each other. That being that anglophone cultures are very cold&#x2F;distant to the importance of family on your life, outside of social convention (and how important that structure&#x2F;convention is); while others (Hawaiian or Nigerian, for instance) treat family as a fluid and inviting unit of kinship.You see this in the more \"warm cultured\" English regions (a good chunk of the US, Australia, etc) where it&#x27;s common to refer to family friends as \"aunt\"&#x2F;\"uncle\", or \"cousin\"; almost in defiance of the linguistic history.In other words, I think the topic is fascinating and deserves even more depth compared to how it was broken down there. reply mvdtnz 9 hours agoparentprevThis is interesting - thank you! reply dang 13 hours agoprevRelated:CNLabelContactRelationYoungerCousinMothersSiblingsDaughterOrFathersSistersDaught - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28712667 - Sept 2021 (132 comments)CNLabelContactRelation&NegativeMediumSpace;YoungerCousin&NegativeMediumSpace;MothersSiblingsDaughter&NegativeMediumSpace;OrFathersSistersDaughter - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20341855 - July 2019 (176 comments)Oh no.

So if you have a \"gammelfarmor\", that&#x27;s either your father&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother, or your father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother, or your mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother for example. reply tobr 13 hours agorootparentprev“Mormorsmor” is a Swedish word. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svenska.se&#x2F;saol&#x2F;?sok=mormorsmor reply hyggetrold 13 hours agorootparentprevDanish: after “mormor” there is “oldemor.” After that you put “tip” in front just like “great” in English. reply daneel_w 9 hours agorootparentprevThere is gammelfarmor, gammelmorfar etc., but those indeed lose track of what side of the family they are on. reply kulahan 12 hours agorootparentprevThe list is blowing my mind.

It would be very confusing to have multiple options that are all just \"cousin\".To solve both that use case and the ones you have in mind, the API could perhaps be extended with a language-aware \"normalization\" procedure that maps relationship labels in a way that loses information but produces a more canonical label for that language. And you&#x27;d use that API only in those cases where it makes sense.But then that would lead to a contact being displayed slightly differently in different settings, which may in itself be confusing to users.At some point you just have to give up and call it good enough. reply mulmen 1 hour agorootparentThat’s not the use case I imagine. When setting relationships in a Chinese localization this option appears with the correct characters in the dropdown. If that contact is shared with an English locale the attribute is still set but it displays as “cousin”. reply klausa 54 minutes agorootparentPeople can use iPhones in English and be native speakers of languages that make the distinction; why would you hide that information from them? reply mercutio2 10 hours agorootparentprevNot if Chinese is one of your chosen languages, it won&#x27;t.EDIT: I see, there were two questions asked, saagarjha answered “yes”, but you’re answering the first question “is this just cousin”.You are correct that it’s not just cousin, sorry for the correction! replyianburrell 7 hours agoparentprevIn Apple Contacts, you can add a relationship to contact. There is a drop down for label with \"mother\", \"son\", etc. Then there is \"All Labels\" which has a ton of relationships.In US, separating out \"younger sister\" is weird, they probably should collapse the list. But in others like Chinese, some of the collapsed relationships have different words. reply duskwuff 13 hours agoparentprev> Why though? Where does this actually get used?Many Asian cultures, including Chinese, have a wider variety of kinship terms than English. The (unwieldy) name of this constant describes one such relationship which doesn&#x27;t have a direct equivalent in English. reply x-complexity 7 hours agoparentprev> Why though? Where does this actually get used?The first 2 letters of the string make it obvious:\"CNLabelContactRelationYoungerCousinMothersSiblingsDaughterOrFathersSistersDaughter\"\"CN\"These labels are often used in Chinese & similar relationship models. It comes from the dual consequence of tightknit multi-generation families & a dense symbol-derived language.

As you said in the thread you&#x27;re running a very small number of servers (less than 30). I&#x27;ve written similiar things over the years and they are great for what you need.When I heavily used Splunk (back in 2013) I was in an application production support team that managed over 100 productions servers for over a dozen applications, there were dozens of other teams in similar situations across the company. The Splunk instance was managed by a central team, minimal assumptions about the client environment, had well defined permissions, understood common and essoteric logging formats, and could reinterpret the log structure at query time. A script like this is not competiting in that kind of situation. reply eigenvalue 14 hours agoparentThanks for the feedback. I do use Paramiko for some things. I tried to use it for everything in the project but ran into some weird stuff that wouldn&#x27;t work reliably for me, which is why I switched some of it over to using SSH directly via subprocess (it was a few months ago so I don&#x27;t even remember now what it was; I believe it was also performance related, since I&#x27;m trying to SSH to tons of machines at the same time concurrently).I guess I did forget to use the execute_network_commands_func. I&#x27;m using the ruff linter extension in VSCode now which would have flagged that to me, but back when I made this I wasn&#x27;t.I don&#x27;t think globals are so awful for certain things.

I’d rather fit more code on the screen at once and instead focus on making the variable names and function names really descriptive and clear so you immediately grasp what it’s doing from context alone.

What is a descriptive function or variable name is extremely dependent on how familiar you are with the context the program functions in. Using `execute_network_commands_func`from above - this descriptive name say nothing about what network commands that are executed. With docstrings it would be so easy to detail input and output of this function. reply msm_ 8 hours agorootparentprevI disagree with comments being distracting. You can overdo them, but one good comment - like \"baz = 1 # the default is 1 instead of 0, because most real-world production servers foobars 1s into 7s\" can save days of frustration.In general, comments often add a very vaulable context to your code in a way that readaable function&#x2F;variable names can&#x27;t. reply hliyan 17 hours agoprevA long long time ago, I used a series of tail -f&#x27;s and unix pipes to aggregate logs, and grep, less and awk to analyse them.

Wouldn&#x27;t you need to keep track of the position of all files, with heuristics around file rotations? And if something catastrophic happens, the most interesting data would be in that last block which couldn&#x27;t be polled?Normally you&#x27;d avoid all that complexity by shipping logs the other way, sending from each machine. That way you can keep state locally should you need to. All unix-like systems do this out of the box, and almost all software supports the syslog protocol to directly stream logs. But you can also use something like filebeat and a bunch of other modern alternatives.The analyzer can then run locally on the log server and a whole lot of complexity just disappears. reply eigenvalue 15 hours agoparentI considered doing it the way you described, but then you need to deploy software on every single one of your machines and make sure it&#x27;s running, that it&#x27;s not accidentally using up 99% of your CPU (I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with the monitoring agents for Splunk and Netdata misbehaving and slowing down the machines and causing problems), etc. Whereas with the \"pull\" approach I used in my tool, you don&#x27;t need to deploy ANY software to the machines you are monitoring-- you just connect with SSH and grab the files you need and do all the work on your control node. reply hjvalente 30 minutes agorootparenthaving a Netdata agent taking your machine&#x27;s CPU to 99% shouldn&#x27;t happen, not sure when was the list time you tried it but a lot of recent improvements have been done on the Netdata Agentalso, with Netdata you can achieve the same architecture design using a Netdata Parent that could be your \"control node\" and to where you stream the metrics of the nodes you want to keep running with as less load as possible - you can even offload the health engine and the machine learningtake a look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.netdata.cloud&#x2F;docs&#x2F;streaming&#x2F; and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.netdata.cloud&#x2F;docs&#x2F;configuring&#x2F;how-to-optimize... reply xorcist 15 hours agorootparentprevOne way or the other, your hosts are running your application, and you are already deploying software on every single host.

While the article provides an in-depth analysis, its a bit easy to miss the point and exert the wrong conclusions from it. As such, and in many cases, users unfamiliar with Godot internals have used it points such as following: Godot C# support is inefficient Godot API and binding system is designed around GDScript Godot is not production ready In this brief article, I will shed a bit more light about how the Godot binding system works and some detail on the Godot architecture. This should hopefully help understand many of the technical decisions behind it. Built-in Types Compared to other game engines, Godot is designed with a relatively high level data model in mind. At the heart, it uses several datatypes across the whole engine. These datatypes are: Nil: To indicate an empty value. Bool, Int64 and Float64: For scalar math. String: For String and Unicode handling. Vector2, Vector2i, Rect2, Rect2i, Transform2D: For 2D Vector math. Vector3, Vector4, Quaternion, AABB, Plane, Projection, Basis, Transform3D: For 3D Vector math. Color: For color space math. StringName: For fast processing of Unique IDs (internally a unique pointer). NodePath: For referencing paths between nodes in the Scene Tree. RID: Resource ID for referencing a resource inside a server. Object: An instance of a class. Callable: A generic function pointer. Signal: A signal (see Godot docs). Dictionary: A generic dictionary (can contain any of these datatypes as either key or value). Array: A generic array (can contain any of these datatypes). PackedByteArray, PackedInt32Array, PackedInt64Array, PackedFloatArray, PackedDoubleArray: Scalar packed arrays. PackedVector2Array, PackedVector3Array, PackedColorarray: Vector packed arrays. PackedStringArray: Packed string array. Does this mean that anything you do in Godot has to use these datatypes? Absolutely not. These datatypes have several roles in Godot: Storage: Any of these datatypes can be saved to disk and loaded back very efficiently. Transfer: These datatypes can be very efficiently marshalled and compressed for transfer over a network. Introspection: Objects in Godot can only expose their properties as any of those datatypes. Editing: When editing any object in Godot, it is done via any of these datatypes (of course, different editors can exist for the same datatype, depending on the context). Languge API: Godot exposes its API to all languages it binds via those datatypes. Of course, if you are absolutely unfamliar to Godot, the first questions that come to mind are: How do you expose more complex datatypes? What about other datatypes such as int16? In general, you can expose more complex datatypes via Object API, so this is not much of an issue. Additionally, modern processors all have at minimum 64 bit buses, so exposing anything other than 64 bit scalar types makes no sense. If you are unfamliar to Godot, I can totally understand the disbelief. But in truth, it works fine and it makes everything far simpler at the time of developing the engine. This data model is one of the main reasons why Godot is such a tiny, efficient and yet feature packed engine compared to the large mainstream mamooths. As you get more familiar with the source code, you will start to see why. Language Binding System Now that we have our data model, Godot imposes a strict requirement that almost any function exposed to the engine API must be done via those datatypes. Any function parameters, return types or properties exposed must be via them too. This makes the job of the binder much simpler. As such, Godot has what we call an universal binder. How does this binder work, then? Godot registers any C++ function to the binder like this: Vector3 MyClass::my_function(const Vector3& p_argname) { //..// } // Then, on a special function, Godot does: // Describe the method as having a name and the name of the argument, the pass the method pointer ClassDB::bind_method(D_METHOD(\"my_function\",\"my_argname\"), &MyClass::my_function); Internally, my_function and my_argument are converted to a StringName (described above), so from now onwards they are treated just as a unique pointer by the binding API. In fact, when compiling on release, the argument name is ignored by the template and no code is generated, since it serves no purpose. So, what does ClassDB::bind_method do? If you want to dive into the depths of insanity and try to understand the incredibly complex and optimized C++17 variadic templates black magic, feel free to go ahead. But In short, it creates a static function like this, which Godot calls \"ptrcall\" form.: // Not really done like this, but simplifying as much as possible so you get an idea: static void my_function_ptrcall(void *instance, void **arguments, void *ret_value) { MyClass *c = (MyClass*)instance; Vector3 *ret = (Vector3*)ret_value; *ret = c->my_method( *(Vector3*)arguments[0] ); } This wrapper is basically as efficient as it can be. In fact, for critical functions, inline is forced into the class method, resulting in a C function pointer to the actual function code. Then Language API works by allowing the request of any engine function in \"ptrcall\" format. To call this format, the language must: Allocate a bit of stack (basically just adjusting the stack pointer of the CPU) set a pointer to the arguments (which already exist in native form in this language 1:1, be it GodotCPP, C#, Rust, etc). call. And that's it. This is an incredibly efficient generic glue API that you can use to expose any language to Godot efficiently. So, as you can imagine, the C# API in Godot basically uses a C function pointer via unsafe API to call after assigning pointers to native C# types. It is very, very efficient. Godot is not the new Unity - The anatomy of a Godot API call I want to insist that the article written by Sam Pruden is fantastic, but if you are not familiar with how Godot is intended to work under the hood it can be very misleading. I will proceed to explain a bit more in detail what is easy to misunderstand. Only a pathological use case is shown, the rest of the API is fine. The use case shown in the article, the ray_cast function, is a pathological one in the Godot API. Cases like this are most likely less 0.01% of the API exposed by Godot. It looks like the author found this by coincidence when trying to profile raycasting, but it is not representative of the rest of the bindings. The problem is that, at the C++ level, this function takes a struct pointer for performance. But at the language binding API this is difficult to expose properly. This is very old code (dating to the opensourcing of Godot) and a Dictionary was hacked-in to use temporarily until something better is found. Of course, other stuff was more prioritary and very few games need thousands of raycasts, so pretty much nobody complained. Still, there is a recently open proposal to discuss more efficient binding of these types of functions. Additionally, to add to how unfortunate this choice of function is, the Godot language binding system does support struct pointers like this. GodotCPP and Rust bindings can use pointers to structs without any issue. The problem is that C# support in Godot predates the extension system and it was not converted to it yet. Eventually, C# will be moved to the universal extension system and this will allow the unifying of the default and .net editors, it is just not the case yet, but its top in the list of priorities. The workaround is even more pathological Although this time, due to a limitation of C#. If you bind C++ to C#, you need to create a C# version of a C++ instance as an adapter. This is not an unique problem to Godot, any other engine or application doing this will require the same. Why is it troublesome? because C# has a garbage collector and C++ does not. This forces the C++ instance to keep a link to the C# instance to avoid it from being collected. Due to this, the C# binder must do extra work when calling Godot functions that take class instances. You can see this code in Sam's article: public static GodotObject UnmanagedGetManaged(IntPtr unmanaged) { if (unmanaged == IntPtr.Zero) return null; IntPtr intPtr = NativeFuncs.godotsharp_internal_unmanaged_get_script_instance_managed(unmanaged, out var r_has_cs_script_instance); if (intPtr != IntPtr.Zero) return (GodotObject)GCHandle.FromIntPtr(intPtr).Target; if (r_has_cs_script_instance.ToBool()) return null; intPtr = NativeFuncs.godotsharp_internal_unmanaged_get_instance_binding_managed(unmanaged); object obj = ((intPtr != IntPtr.Zero) ? GCHandle.FromIntPtr(intPtr).Target : null); if (obj != null) return (GodotObject)obj; intPtr = NativeFuncs.godotsharp_internal_unmanaged_instance_binding_create_managed(unmanaged, intPtr); if (!(intPtr != IntPtr.Zero)) return null; return (GodotObject)GCHandle.FromIntPtr(intPtr).Target; } While very efficient, it's still not ideal for hot paths so the Godot API exposed is considerate and does not expose anything critical this way. The workaround used, however, is quite complex and hits this path due to not using the actual function intended for it. The question of cherry picking I firmly believe the author did not cherry pick this API on purpose. In fact, he himself writes that he checked other places of API usages and did not find anything with this level of pathology either. To clarify further, he mentions: Let’s also remember that Dictionary is only part of the problem. If we look a little wider for things returning Godot.Collections.Array (remember: heap allocated, contents as Variant) we find lots from physics, mesh & geometry manipulation, navigation, tilemaps, rendering, and more. From my side and contributors side, none of those usages are hot paths or pathological. Remember that, as I mentioned above, Godot uses the Godot types mainly for serialization and API communication. While it is true that they do heap allocation, this only happens once when the data is created. I think what may have confused Sam and a few others in this area (which is normal if you are not familiar with the Godot codebase) is that Godot containers don't work like STL containers. Because they are used mainly to pass data around, they are allocated once and then kept via reference counting. This means, the function that reads your mesh data from disk is the only one doing the allocation, then this pointer gets passed through many layers via reference counting until arrives Vulkan and is uploaded to the GPU. Zero copies happen along the way. Likewise, when these containers are exposed to C# via the Godot collections, they are also reference counted internally. If you create one of those arrays to pass the the Godot API, the allocation only happens once. Then no further copies happen and the data arrives intact to the consumer. Of course, intenally, Godot uses far more optimized containers that are not directly exposed to the binder API. Misleading conclusion The article concludes like this: Godot has made a philosophical decision to be slow. The only practical way to interact with the engine is via this binding layer, and its core design prevents it from ever being fast. No amount of optimising the implementation of Dictionary or speeding up the physics engine is going to get around the fact we’re passing large heap allocated values around when we should be dealing with tiny structs. While C# and GDScript APIs remain synchronised, this will always hold the engine back. As you have read in the above points, the binding layer is absolutely not slow. What can be slow is an extremely limited amount of use cases that can be pathological. For those cases, a dedicated solution is found. This is a general philosophy behind Godot development that helps keep the codebase small, tidy, maintainable and easy to understand. In other words, this principle: The current binder serves its purpose and works well and efficiently for over 99.99% of use cases. For the exceptional ones, as mentioned before, the extension API supports structs already (which you can see here in this excerpt of the extension api dump): {\"name\": \"PhysicsServer2DExtensionRayResult\",\"format\": \"Vector2 position;Vector2 normal;RID rid;ObjectID collider_id;Object *collider;int shape\" }, {\"name\": \"PhysicsServer2DExtensionShapeRestInfo\",\"format\": \"Vector2 point;Vector2 normal;RID rid;ObjectID collider_id;int shape;Vector2 linear_velocity\" }, {\"name\": \"PhysicsServer2DExtensionShapeResult\",\"format\": \"RID rid;ObjectID collider_id;Object *collider;int shape\" }, {\"name\": \"PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionCollision\",\"format\": \"Vector3 position;Vector3 normal;Vector3 collider_velocity;Vector3 collider_angular_velocity;real_t depth;int local_shape;ObjectID collider_id;RID collider;int collider_shape\" }, {\"name\": \"PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionResult\",\"format\": \"Vector3 travel;Vector3 remainder;real_t collision_depth;real_t collision_safe_fraction;real_t collision_unsafe_fraction;PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionCollision collisions[32];int collision_count\" }, So, ultimately, I believe that the conclusion that \"Godot is slow by design\" is a bit rushed. What is currently missing is the move of the C# language to the GDExtension system in order to be able to take advantage of these. This is currently a work in progress. To sum up I hope that this short article is used to dispell a few misconceptions that unintentionally arised from Sam's excellent article: Godot C# API is inefficient: This is absolutely not the case, but very few pathological cases remain to be solved and were already being in discussion before last week. In practice, very very few games may run into them and, by next year, hopefully none. Godot API is designed around GDScript: This is also not true. In fact, until Godot 4.1, typed GDScript did calls via \"ptrcall\" syntax, and the argument encoding was a bottleneck. As a result, we created a special path for GDScript to call more efficiently. Thanks for reading and remember that Godot is not commercial software developed behind closed doors. All of us who make it are available online in the same communities as you. If you have any doubt, feel free to ask us directly. Bonus: As a side note, and contrary to popular belief, the Godot data model was not created for GDScript. Originaly, the engine used other languages such as Lua or Squirrel, with several published games while an in-house engine. GDScript was developed afterwards. Load earlier comments... SamPruden commented @reduz You're probably right about small GC not being that big of a deal. I suppose we can get a fairly objective answer to this with benchmarks and profiling. I'll see if I can throw something together and report back. Anecdotally, I know that even small numbers of small allocations used to cause bad problems in Mono, although that was a few years back that I checked. It's likely this is less of an issue with the runtime used here, although it sounds like (from what I picked up in the DotNet meeting earlier) the Mono runtime may still be used on some platforms - so it's probably hard to do a universal benchmark across all use cases. RE bump allocator, I was actually thinking about doing that entirely in C# land, then using it for the \"I give you buffer, you give me data\" approach. It's a more ergonomic version of that pattern, because you don't need to awkwardly create and cache a List in a field somewhere for use as an implementation detail of some method. My opinion would still be: If we have a good pattern for doing zero allocations, that should probably be done everywhere whether or not it's significant, because why not? This guards against weird problems where e.g the GC is particularly poor on some future platform/runtime. I'm also a little uncomfortable with the engine making judgements about which methods are hot path and which aren't - users will find unanticipated hot path usecases for things. I'm afraid that throughout this process over the last few days, the relevance of the struct proposal has alluded me. There's been quite a lot of confusion in various discussions due to the overloaded terminology - the reference counted struct in that proposal seems very different from the value type \"native struct\" that would most obviously help with things in C#. SamPruden commented Although #81004 looks like a fun struct PR that could use some love :) lrahmann commented Not sure how relevant that is these days, and it only matters for C# anyways. But on some platforms without a generational multi threaded or incremental GC (e.g. Unity until a few years ago on consoles etc.) running the GC always meant scanning the whole heap resulting in a noticeable lag. The only way to get around this was not triggering the GC by having a zero new object count. Unity went even further with .DOTS which also reduces the size of the managed heap. ChrisAbra commented Perhaps naively jumping in on this one, but dotnet allows alternative garbage collectors . If the core-side is already being refcounted anyway, would it make sense not to extend/replace the C# GC? At least for garbage that's created in these interface layers. Or otherwise modifying the default behaviour of the dotnet GC given its running under a more predictable/known circumstnaces? It makes sense not to do allocations in hotpaths (and it seems largely the engine does not) but if we know what allocations we're doing and likely to do, we could account for it? Author reduz commented @SamPruden My opinion would still be: If we have a good pattern for doing zero allocations, that should probably be done everywhere whether or not it's significant, because why not? To me this is solutions in search of a problem. The advantage of the current API is that its exposed in a very simple and predictable way. It's very difficult to write software based on speculation on what will be best and what will be fast, or even based on benchmarks that don't have any real-world usage scenario behind them. It's easier to write software to react to real-world bottlenecks. As an example, the current ray_cast function you found was indeed slow, but thousands of Godot games have been published to Steam with Godot and nobody ever complained. This means no one used it as much as you intended it to. Now that you stumbled into this problem, there is more motivation to fix this, otherwise all this is premature optimization. Author reduz commented @lrahmann I trust that current C# is far more capable than older versions of Unity in terms of GC. I think we first have to see how well it works, then see whether optimizations make sense. jams3223 commented • edited @lrahmann I trust that current C# is far more capable than older versions of Unity in terms of GC. I think we first have to see how well it works, then see whether optimizations make sense. Actually, the raycast problems cause more issues in games published on Steam than you think, especially with games where there's a lot of enemies moving around, which could even cause some performance issues on multiplayer games made with the engine. I've encountered that issue with 2D games where I had to run them at 30 FPS just because there were many enemies on the screen, so they became CPU-bound. Author reduz commented • edited @jams3223 That sucks to know, but either case it is still something that was on track to be fixed anyway.

Waiting to optimize until somebody complains is not a good idea. Out of all the people who have evaluated Godot to make games with how many passed on it completely because it wasn't performant enough? A common \"solution\" to @SamPruden in the reddit threads were to just simplify his game scope, which shows the mentality to adapt games to Godot's limitations is somewhat widespread in the community. Cicaeda commented • edited @reduz To me this is solutions in search of a problem. The advantage of the current API is that its exposed in a very simple and predictable way. It's very difficult to write software based on speculation on what will be best and what will be fast, or even based on benchmarks that don't have any real-world usage scenario behind them. The Unity community, both Unity employees and programmers, have long since learned the lesson that allocating anything in the hot path is a very bad, slow thing in any programming language. If you want to write fast code, you don't allocate. It's as simple as that. For us, it's not speculation. It's fact as old as time. We went through the phase of eliminating allocation from every major package nearly a decade ago. For context, at every studio I've worked at, you aren't allowed to allocate anything in the hotpath. You also need to understand that every noteworthy asset on the Unity asset store is zero allocation, and if it does have any allocation when it releases, people complain about it and until it gets fixed, and it does get fixed. If Godot is looking to position itself as a professional option for studios formerly using Unity, it needs to adopt a more aggressive policy towards eliminating allocation in the core API. You need to rip off the band-aid and get it over with because fighting it tooth and nail is just going to make a lot of people miserable. Seeing this kind of resistance to modern C# standards is a huge red flag for anyone looking for an engine that uses C#.

Seeing this kind of resistance to modern C# standards is a huge red flag for anyone looking for an engine that uses C#. Imho, this is giving Unity a bit too much credit. Have people already forgotten than until not so long ago a lot of common language patterns and APIs allocated garbage? Foreach iterations or old physics APIs being the classical examples. The engine was doing perfectly fine and kept improving over time. I see no reason to think Godot will be any different - and arguably its already in a better spot just due to having modern C# I think we may also have different opinions on what consists a prominent asset and what Unity was like a decade ago as I very much remember many issues with GC in a lot of them and in the engine itself (that had just recently hit version 4.0, ironically enough, coincidences are a funny thing). ^^ SamPruden commented • edited @jams3223 That sucks to know, but either case it is still something that was on track to be fixed anyway. Its just that it did not seem so urgent based on user feedback to justify prioritizing it. I suppose the problem is that something's gone wrong if it needs to be fixed in the first place. The current way binding is done means that, without great care, idiomatic Godot core APIs (which do cater to GDScript, there's no other explanation for returning Dictionary or Godot arrays) lead to bad C# and GDE APIs. (Sometimes) Looking from the outside, it seems far more natural for the core API to return a more neutral type, and for the conversion to GDS compatible types to be the responsibility of the GDS module. If this responsibility model were adopted, these discussions would never need to happen because each language would automatically do the fastest and most idiomatic thing for itself. The current situation guides us to bad results for both performance and ergonomics outside of GDS. Although there's a lot of casual talk of fixing it, I don't quite know what that means. Is the API going to get a breaking change? If not, the fix we end up with will be a little messy, and will not be a pit of success, as the easiest API will likely still be the current one. This would be a strong argument in favour of caring about the performance of every method up front, whether or not it's anticipated to be important - nobody wants to be in the ugly position of having to try to fix it after the fact. My position is that a fairly moderate change of habits in the core (changes to idiomatic patterns for inputting and outputting arrays, and inputting and outputting struct-likes) would eliminate all of these problems in the future, and give each language more flexibility to cater to its own needs. Once that work is done, I actually think it would also reduce the dev/maintenance burden. The current situation means that neither Godot developers or users have a reliable pit of success to fall into. TwoBitMachines commented @Calandiel Imho, this is giving Unity a bit too much credit. Have people already forgotten than until not so long ago a lot of common language patterns and APIs allocated garbage? Foreach iterations or old physics APIs being the classical examples. The engine was doing perfectly fine and kept improving over time. I see no reason to think Godot will be any different - and arguably its already in a better spot just due to having modern C# One thing, however, is that you could always use the humble for loop instead of a foreach loop, so it wasn't a problem, and it was the same for other non-friendly allocating methods. TwoBitMachines commented • edited @reduz @jams3223 That sucks to know, but either case it is still something that was on track to be fixed anyway. Its just that it did not seem so urgent based on user feedback to justify prioritizing it. I have two big tools I made for the unity asset store, and they make heavy use of raycasts2d. The raycast is absolutely essential. So I hope it gets more love in Godot if possible! Calandiel commented @Calandiel Imho, this is giving Unity a bit too much credit.

Well, hence \"common language patterns\" (the foreach) and \"APIs\" (physics and find methods). My point is more that if you go out of your way to write performant code, Godot doesn't do worse than not-so-old versions of Unity -- and arguably better with tighter C++ integration and more modern C# runtime. That being said its hard to disagree that raycast in particular could use some love ^.^ Author reduz commented @OCASM Waiting to optimize until somebody complains is not a good idea. You make it sound like this is a simple optimization that nobody did because nobody complained. That is not the case, this is a complex optimization that required a lot of work in the language binder (which is now done) and it now requires a good amount of work in the C# bindings to take advantage of it. Author reduz commented @Cicaeda The Unity community, both Unity employees and programmers, have long since learned the lesson that allocating anything in the hot path is a very bad, slow thing in any programming language. I suggest you read my messages again, what I said is precisely that none of that is the hot path. SamPruden commented @reduz for the sake of clarity, could you define what you mean by hot path? In games I think most of us (certainly I) take it to mean anything that might be called even once in a typical frame.

If not, the fix we end up with will be a little messy, and will not be a pit of success, as the easiest API will likely still be the current one. Probably going to be a two-fold fix.

Absolutely not. I will insist your view is extremely misled because you are not familiar with the source code. Godot is a gigantic codebase and optimizing everything that exists for the sake of it is not only an large waste of effort and time, but it results in far more complex and difficult to maintain code. As such, only the performance critical areas get performance critical optimizations. Author reduz commented @SamPruden for the sake of clarity, could you define what you mean by hot path? In games I think most of us (certainly I) take it to mean anything that might be called even once in a typical frame. In this context, hot path is something you call hundreds to thousands of times in a frame. Even having a few hundreds of memory allocation is not going to put any sweat into the GC. eamonwoortman commented • edited Although there's a lot of casual talk of fixing it, I don't quite know what that means.

I agree with @Calandiel here, maybe we're giving Unity a bit too much credit. There was a time where Unity's Physics.{X}CastAllNonAlloc() didn't exist (< 5.3), and they've only just recently opened up new API paths that take in NativeArray pointers for stuff like mesh generation. Given the fact a total API change is going to be too impactful, I don't see why we can't be happy with intermediate, non-breaking API changes like RayCastNonAlloc (unless I'm misunderstanding the contributors intent). zeux commented • edited I used languages with far shitter GC in the past (lua as example) and to hit GC stall you really have to do a shitton of allocations per frame, not just a bunch. That is because Lua GC is incremental (short of Lua 5.4 gengc which I would not recommend for real-time applications), and has comparatively few cases where a substantial amount of work is being done in response to an allocation. Typically per 1 KB of allocations you're traversing 2 KB of data give or take. Lua 5.x GC implementation is not ideal (Luau improves on it substantially) but the fundamental design is sound. Compared to this, in Unity before their current incremental GC work (of which I don't know much), you could hit a full-heap GC relatively easily when doing allocations per frame - it wasn't a question of whether you'd hit it, but a question of when.

As such, only the performance critical areas get performance critical optimizations. I think you and I have different views on what optimisation is. My view is articulated very well by Casey Muratori. I would say that what we're talking about here is not really optimisation, it's making high level design pattern decisions that don't make the CPU do lots more work than it needs to. In Casey speak, this is non-pessimisation. I would say that, done carefully, there would be very little added complexity from doing this now that ClassDB supports native structs. I think at this point we're not making a lot of progress in the conversation, so maybe I just need to fork and implement, so we can see where things land empirically. You are obviously a lot more familiar with the internals than I am! I've spent the last couple of days grokking the binding layer, but it's pretty dense. In this context, hot path is something you call hundreds to thousands of times in a frame. Even having a few hundreds of memory allocation is not going to put any sweat into the GC. I think you will find that these performance philosophies are considered unacceptable by many Unity devs. I don't know whether you care about catering to them - perhaps they're just not your target audience, and that's absolutely fine. Author reduz commented @SamPruden The current way binding is done means that, without great care, idiomatic Godot core APIs (which do cater to GDScript, there's no other explanation for returning Dictionary or Godot arrays) lead to bad C# and GDE APIs. (Sometimes) Again I think you keep generalizing due to being very unfamiliar with the codebase and repeating the two same false premises I wrote in the article above: Assuming code like this is widespread in the codebase Assuming the binder API is designed around GDScript I took the effort to refute both. If either you won't believe me nor take the effort to see by yourself properly in the source code (not doing a grep, but learning how it actually works) then I feel continuing this this discussion is pointless. SamPruden commented • edited My findings so far (and other people commenting on reddit are reporting similar things) are that these types are used quite often in practice in the parts of the API we want to use most. However I don't want this to get hostile, so I think we can leave it here for now. Author reduz commented • edited @SamPruden I think you and I have different views on what optimisation is. My view is articulated very well by Casey Muratori. I don't think this is about views but about context. I believe Muratori's views are fine for his field of experience, but IMO It's not a context you can take and happily extrapolate to everything else. Different software has different requirements that you have to understand before you make decisions. I think you will find that these performance philosophies are considered unacceptable by many Unity devs. I don't know whether you care about catering to them - perhaps they're just not your target audience, and that's absolutely fine. EDIT: Sorry I misunderstood this. If by \"catering to them\" means doing things like Unity just because this is what they are used to, then I don't think this will happen. The general idea behind Godot development is fixing real problems people have, not catering to people with a specific philosophy or that speculates about potential problems they don't actually have. To be more precise, If they use Godot and have a specific performance problem doing something, they show us what they are doing and we see how to solve it. The fix may be a more fundamental change, or it may be a simple workaround, but It doesn't go beyond that. If simply they come to us with the speculation that something is a problem, then nothing is done from our side. Development is very pragmatic in this sense.

However I don't want this to get hostile, so I think we can leave it here for now. All I can say is that I am sorry if you are disappointed if things are not done the way you expect. You would not be the first nor the last person disappointment by the strongly pragmatic approach to software development we use in Godot (which is mainly documented here). This is what we have found over many years to be what works best for us. If for other projects other approaches work better, that is fine too. abcjjy commented Will Godot change its primary scripting language in the future? I'm new to Godot.

Hopefully this discussion will lead towards this issue being resolved.I actually found Sam Pruden&#x27;s complaint a bit odd since it sounds like he&#x27;s developing a 2d game. If you&#x27;re spamming 1000s of raycasts per frame for your 2d game, there&#x27;s probably something else going on... reply hutzlibu 17 hours agoparent\"If you&#x27;re spamming 1000s of raycasts per frame for your 2d game, there&#x27;s probably something else going on...\"Yup .. but maybe not stupidity, but rather a non generic game.In my case I need lots of raycasts, to determine what exactly the player and the enemy bots can see. Basically I have a simulation in 2D (using box2d directly in js as a wasm libary) - and all the bots and the player only (mostly) get information based on raycasts. They have to scan the world and react to that information, which leads to a different result, than the usual approach (cheating). So I am looking forward to get this fixed asap as well and also cannot really consider godot before that.Edit: performance problems with raycasts I had to experience as well, because the roundtrip js to wasm is expensive. I first wrote a WebGPU shader doing only raycasting in my world, but better was modifying box2d (and compiling to wasm) to include a function, that does all my raycasts in one call and returns a big array (or rather a array with pointers to the structs in the internal wasm heap). reply rngname22 17 hours agorootparentIf the game is 2D and you can divide space into tiles&#x2F;blocks and walls&#x2F;obstacles have their own blocks&#x2F;tiles (or you can easily establish a grid over your world and determine what cell each actor is in), I wonder if there&#x27;s way to use BFS in a maze-solving manner to calculate shortest path between a given actor and the target you want to check visibility for, and if the distance in blocks&#x2F;tiles returned by BFS&#x2F;pseudo-pathfinding is greater than a direct distance formula calculation between the two blocks&#x2F;cells then maybe you know there&#x27;s an obstacle? I guess that requires you to be able to create the network&#x2F;graph of traversable nodes as well. reply hutzlibu 16 hours agorootparentWell, the world is destructible, so when there is a small hole (of dynamic size) in a wall, then a enemy bot should really only see the player, if there is no rubble blocking the path. Meaning tiles are waay too big for my simulation and raycasting the most straightforward way, also some enemies can evade projectiles and obstacles, but also have to scan them first.And it works already the way I want it. It could just be more performant, so more details and realism would be possible. reply rcme 15 hours agorootparentAnd, additionally, raycasting should just work in a good game engine. “You don’t need raycasting” is a seriously weak argument. reply hutzlibu 15 hours agorootparentYes. I just expect raycasting to work allmost as good as possible, not on 50% to become a unnecessary blocker. But they say, they are going to fix it with some priority. reply QuadmasterXLII 16 hours agorootparentprev(Roughly, glossing over ‘linear in what?’) Good bfs gets close to linear, good raycasting should be way, way sublinear reply LarsDu88 15 hours agorootparent\"Good raycasting should be sublinear\" yes, but some folks like to stick 100 raycasts on every character which will kill the performance regardless of what engine your making your game in. reply eutectic 13 hours agorootparentWe now have games which rely on shooting millions of rays per frame for rendering. reply LarsDu88 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s hard to tell without seeing a screenshot or video of the game in question, but there are almost certainly ways to optimize this problem.If there are on the order of even several dozen enemies on the screen at any given time, you could simply maintain runtime sets of different factions and only do line-of-sight checks between hostile groups within a certain proximity.There&#x27;s probably hundreds of better ways to do this than by spamming raycasts. I have a VR space game with dozens of spaceships, and there are generally never more than num_spaceships raycasts getting fired every frame reply hutzlibu 15 hours agorootparent\"but there are almost certainly ways to optimize this problem.\"Sure, I optimize what I can. But there is only so much I can do, without hurting the core game mechanic. Which is a arcade shooter, but also a hacker game, where you program your bots. So the bots are mostly limited to radar distance information by design, to work out their position in the world and what to do next (but to make this work with many bots, I already had to cheat a lot).And it is unreleased, in case you are wondering .. but I hope to ship an alpha, soon. So it already works and it is fun. So I won&#x27;t change core functionality, but I am still optimizing wherever I can. 3 months ago, it would only run on gaming hardware. Now medium mobile phones (a big market) are within reach. reply JuanPosadas 8 hours agorootparentprev> raycasts getting fired every frameAlso don&#x27;t need to do this every frame, do X% each tick (not frames literally), rotating which objects get their checks. reply ehutch79 17 hours agorootparentprevWait. that doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re doing 1000s of raycasts? Just a few, maybe a dozen?also, sounds like you&#x27;re using JS, not Godot? reply hutzlibu 16 hours agorootparentWell, I would like to be able to do 1000s of raycast per frame (360 for each bot), but cannot and yes, I do not use godot, but my own engine (with pixijs for graphics and a emscriptem port of box2d for physics https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Birch-san&#x2F;box2d-wasm.) Godot uses box2d, too, so that would be convenient, if I switch to godot, but only if it is worth the performance improvement, which it currently does not seem to be. Maybe next year. reply LarsDu88 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard to evaluate this without seeing a screenshot of your game, but 360 raycasts per bot per frame for a basic 2d game is INSANE.It sounds like you are trying to query every angle in every direction for every character. This is madness.I have a 3d space game in Unity which uses raycasts for navigation. Each ship fires a maximum of 1 navigation raycast per frame with a sweep pattern. In addition there are anti collision thrusters placed around each ship which fire roughly every second in a staggered pattern to prevent ships from getting stuckIn my fully 3d game, that&#x27;s effectively ~1 raycast per frame per enemy. To locate hostiles, each ai character scans a runtime set of potential hostiles and does a line-of-sight query roughly once every 5 seconds.There definitely is another issue going on here with your setup that is independent of the extreme overhead in Godot.I would recommend Sebastian Langue&#x27;s excellent boids video to get a sense about other strategies to deal with these types of queries: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw reply GranPC 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s possible that they are building a game in which players can program bots that only know the state of the world by performing raycasts, as if it were a sensor of sorts. That would be a valid reason to require such an amount of raycasts per bot - although I probably would not run them every frame, but rather spread the load throughout multiple frames. reply hutzlibu 14 hours agorootparentYes exactly. But the projectiles are moving every tick, so the evading logic wants to run every tick as well. But optimizing that will be up to the player.. reply meheleventyone 14 hours agorootparentI’d recommend cheating! It only has to appear to the user that the bot is scanning the world. For example in this specific case you could find all the projectiles close enough to the bot to be detected and do one raycast per projectile to determine visibility. This is functionally the same result as many dense raycasts but at a fraction of the computational cost because you have all the information already in the simulation.Although I really like the idea of giving the player control over how the bot raycasts and letting them optimise that. Lots of fun strategies to find there! I’d even bound it so they can’t afford to do too many raycasts so they have to get creative. reply GranPC 12 hours agorootparent> Although I really like the idea of giving the player control over how the bot raycasts and letting them optimise that. Lots of fun strategies to find there! I’d even bound it so they can’t afford to do too many raycasts so they have to get creative.This is actually exactly what I did when I built a similar game about a decade ago! Bots had a budget of 20 raycasts per second, which would slowly replenish. It was the bot programmer&#x27;s responsibility to figure out the best way to use them. It was a lot of fun! :) reply hutzlibu 15 hours agorootparentprev\"It sounds like you are trying to query every angle in every direction for every character. This is madness.\"It is just a different game than yours, so maybe don&#x27;t judge? reply bluescrn 15 hours agorootparentprevThe usual solution for something like this is just to spread the work over multiple frames. Most game enemy logic doesn&#x27;t need running every single frame. Update 10% of your bots every frame.Also consider whether 360 rays is really needed to begin with, one ray per degree sounds like an arbitrary first-pass value. Can you cast a smaller set of rays first, and only cast the in-between rays if certain conditions are met (e.g. the initial rays hit something close, or their hit distances vary significantly) reply hutzlibu 14 hours agorootparent\"Can you cast a smaller set of rays first, and only cast the in-between rays if certain conditions are met \"Yes I can do this. But my case is really special as in basically the players have to do this by themself. As it is (also) a hacking game, meaning they have a limited scan budget and need to figure out to spend it the most useful for their bots.. but since they also want to evade projectiles and other bots, they want to scan as much as possible to not miss a threat.So it works the way it is. Just would scale better, with better raycast performance.I probably should have hinted more above, why my case is really special, but that was kind of my point, there are always special cases. And I do not want to limit my design, because of a bad raycast implementation. reply otto2 6 hours agorootparentYou can still optimize this. If the scan has to establish line-of-sight between bots, your engine can establish that, and when firing raycasts, to skip those that are known to be misses. It doesn&#x27;t change anything for the bot that fires raycasts. You could also calculate extremes (leftmost and rightmost) and return positives in between. This would decrease number of raycasts by two orders of magnitude. Also add a possibility to skip every 2nd, 3rd etc frame so that you can evaluate if it impacts game play. reply ehutch79 12 hours agorootparentprevWait. I was thinking 1000s of objects doing raycasts. reply hutzlibu 6 hours agorootparentIdeally yes, this is what I would like to do, to be able to control armies of bots. So because of the limitations, there are only 2-3 smart bots and lots of dumb ones. reply fidotron 16 hours agorootparentprev> because the roundtrip js to wasm is expensive.Is this a thing?I&#x27;ve been using ammo (wasm bullet) and while wasm interfacing certainly has a mismatch with idiomatic js I haven&#x27;t knowably hit a problem with that bridge. reply hutzlibu 16 hours agorootparentIt used to be waaaay more expensive and has gotten much better now. But it still costs, all I know is, that when I do 600 raycasts each, it costs me around 8 ms on medium hardware. Batching it reduces the cost to 2 ms for me. For simple things like GetPosition I did not noticed a perf hit, but for getting vertices I also did. So mid term, I will batch all often used calls into wasm. For now raycasting was the biggest bottleneck. reply fidotron 16 hours agorootparentThanks for that! I will have to take a deeper look. reply meheleventyone 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah it’s quite common on most interop boundaries because there is always some amount of marshalling. It used to be a thing in Unity that it was significantly faster to run your own tick for all entities from a manager that hooked the callback from native code than to have to cross back and forth n entity times.For anything you’re doing in WASM it’s much better to batch and cross the boundary as little as possible in hot loops. For example a performant renderer wouldn’t translate all the API calls but put together a command buffer to be returned to JS and then forwarded to the API in one go. reply Cyphus 15 hours agoparentprev> inefficient raycasts aren&#x27;t some sort of pathological edge case.You&#x27;re right that raycasts aren&#x27;t an edge case in terms of usage, but Juan Linietsky&#x27;s point is that the inefficient path used for this API call is a rare exception to the efficient paths used by the vast majority of the API. reply db48x 17 hours agoparentprevIf you’re doing thousands of raycasts per frame in any game, 2D or 3D, then something has gone wrong. Raycasts are very general, and there is often a more specialized way to get the same information that won’t require as much work. reply bluescrn 13 hours agorootparentI learned to code in the 8-bit days where you&#x27;d count to 1000 in a BASIC for loop to create a significant delay. I guess I&#x27;ve not got out of the mindset that doing anything 1000x is quite a lot (particularly when you&#x27;re aiming to do it 60 or more times per second).But as somebody working in Unity (and often on mobile), there&#x27;s still many cases where 1000 of something is a lot, and should perhaps be cause to rethink your approach. For example 1000 draw calls, 1000 UI elements, 1000 instances of even the most simple prefab.1000 raycasts per frame is also something that I&#x27;d try to avoid. But if they seemed important, you&#x27;ve just got to try it and profile it. Nobody can answer &#x27;what is the cost of 1000 raycasts?&#x27; without a fair bit more information. reply db48x 11 hours agorootparentI agree that profiling is the ultimate arbiter. reply pelasaco 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think how it can be wrong. I wrote a beaten-up game, 2.5D. Player(s) + Enemies + NPCs + Weapons + Bullets.. I can imagine that in some moments, we were easily doing a few hundreds of raycasts per frame. reply db48x 11 hours agorootparentRaycasts are a very useful tool, and you shouldn’t avoid using them if they’re the only thing that will work. But a _fully general_ raycast is always the most expensive option. For example, an axis–aligned raycast will always be cheaper and might do the job just as well.The previously mentioned case of doing hundreds of raycasts all starting in the same location but each in a different direction could be done with rasterization instead. That’ll involve a single loop over all the triangles in the world instead of one loop over the same triangles for each raycast. And for NPC vision you could rasterize billboards instead of the full character geometry. You can probably simplify the world geometry too.That’s all I mean. reply Rapzid 9 hours agorootparentI mean it&#x27;s game dev, there&#x27;s always work arounds and efficiency hacks.But what does any of this has to do with improving the ABI? reply moffkalast 16 hours agorootparentprevMaybe there&#x27;s thousands of guns being fired. reply db48x 11 hours agorootparentOk, if you’ve got thousands of players in the game then you’re doing _something_ right, even if the raycasts aren’t helping :) reply TazeTSchnitzel 17 hours agoparentprevThere are multiple APIs for doing raycasts in Godot; this one happens to be the least efficient. reply TylerGlaiel 16 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s nothing wrong with spamming 1000s of raycasts per frame in a 2D game. They should be very cheap, so the performance impact of that should not be something you have to think about, and if some interaction or mechanic is easy to express with a boatload of raycasts, you should be able to just do that reply LarsDu88 15 hours agorootparentIt depends on the type of game, but 360 raycasts per bot is definitely a code smell that warrants a closer look at how the game is being architected. reply Kiro 16 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t that how you do line-of-sight&#x2F;shadows, with thousands of raycasts for all pixels on screen? reply starkparker 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s raytracing. You can do LOS by raycasting only at line segments and points of blocking shapes, especially in 2D, which is the original post&#x27;s concern. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncase.me&#x2F;sight-and-light&#x2F; reply kaibee 16 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely not. There&#x27;s uh, a lot of tutorials on YouTube about how to go about implementing this kinda thing, depending on the kind of game (top-down 2d, vs 3d etc). Sorry don&#x27;t have time to do a full write up lol. reply hutzlibu 15 hours agorootparentBut this approach actually also works and delivers different results in 2D space, than doing what you probably have in mind.This approach in 3D would basically mean live raycasting rendering, which is something I would like to try in the future. reply jmull 18 hours agoprevStrong response.I&#x27;m not sure I would have been so generous to the author of the article this is in reply to. But I suppose that&#x27;s a skill of a successful open source leader -- to turn interactions with critics into productive discussions rather than arguments, and perhaps even turn the critics into supporters.It seems to have been that author who chose the FUD-ful title \"Godot is not the new Unity\". I guess there are times in life where you face a choice: be fair, reasonable, and intelligent, or... just try to get them clicks.Well, that article got a lot of click. Good job? reply kbelder 17 hours agoparentI said this not long ago in a different thread, but after reading this article I want to say it again. I&#x27;m very impressed with the management of the Godot project. They seem to be avoiding all the common mistakes and drama that so many projects fall prey to. They&#x27;re doing everything professionally. reply Lerc 17 hours agorootparentI have contributed a very small amount of code to Godot. In the process of doing so I was very impressed with the entire process. They were very supportive and quick to respond. Overall it was one of the best open-source contribution interactions I have experienced. reply JD557 17 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;m not sure I would have been so generous to the author of the article this is in reply to. But I suppose that&#x27;s a skill of a successful open source leader -- to turn interactions with critics into productive discussions rather than arguments, and perhaps even turn the critics into supporters.FWIW, reduz (Godot author) and sprudd (\"Godot is not the new Unity\" author) previously discussed this on Reddit[1], and sprudd was actually sounded pretty nice (the first reply even includes a \"and I hope that I wasn&#x27;t too rude in the article. :)\").Overall, I think the original article was written in good faith, just with a click-baity title (and I imagine reduz thought the same thing). That might have helped to avoid a more angry reply.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;godot&#x2F;comments&#x2F;16lti15&#x2F;godot_is_not... reply Xeamek 16 hours agoparentprevCommon now, the original article is perfectly reasonable one, and that includes its title as well.For the past few days everyone is talking about Unity, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exaggeration to say that Godot has become the de facto alternative in low to mid level game development.Godot itself will (if not already is) benefit from that status a lot. Article that brings highlights parts well Godot is lacking compared to Unity is perfectly valid criticism to have. reply Rapzid 13 hours agorootparentAgree 100%. The conversations sparked from this article are how the project improves. The maintainers seem very appreciative of it. reply pelasaco 15 hours agorootparentprev> Godot itself will (if not already is) benefit from that status a lot. Article that brings highlights parts well Godot is lacking compared to Unity is perfectly valid criticism to have.And that&#x27;s because the author didn&#x27;t even touch the \"in-app\" purchase and \"in-app\" ads capabilites from Godot x Unity, which is the way the studios complaining about the new Unity pricing, generate their income.. reply gsuuon 17 hours agoprevIt sounds like Godot just needs a few more hands on deck to close up a lot of these smaller gaps, as Juan mentions most of the issues are already being discussed or were simply lower priority to fix. Hopefully with the influx of Unity refugees (and potential contributors) they&#x27;ll be able to quicker ship more of the things they already have on their roadmap.I do think the original article&#x27;s claim of &#x27;Godot is not the new Unity&#x27; is accurate, just not for the architectural reasons claimed. Folks probably shouldn&#x27;t go into it thinking that Godot will handle every use case just as well as Unity. It hasn&#x27;t had billions poured into it like Unity, but it is mature and ready for serious games. Plus - open source means you can just get your hands dirty and fix critical (for you) bugs instead of hoping Unity gets around to it. reply 26fingies 17 hours agoprevIt seems weird to extrapolate where Godot will live in the game development ecosystem from its current performance characteristics for certain operations. It&#x27;s like trying out Windows 95 and saying \"Microsoft isn&#x27;t going to dominate the PC world because Windows 95 crashes a lot!\" Maybe.. but these sorts of technical minutae are not the things that determine winners as far as I can tell. reply dundarious 16 hours agoparent“Godot is not the new Unity” is a present tense statement, issued at a time when many studios are considering a hasty and impromptu transition from Unity -- they are looking for a suitable equivalent now, not many years into the future. It&#x27;s a sensible question about today and the very near future. reply ladberg 18 hours agoprev> Additionally, modern processors all have at minimum 64 bit buses, so exposing anything other than 64 bit scalar types makes no sense.I feel like this entirely disregards the caching costs of using >2x more memory in some cases, speed of float32 vs float64 operations on CPU, and potential CPUGPU memory transfers.EDIT: Nvm disregard this comment, I just noticed the existence of: PackedByteArray, PackedInt32Array, PackedInt64Array, PackedFloatArray, PackedDoubleArrayAnything set of numbers needed by the GPU or big enough to affect the cache will probably use those arrays. reply gabereiser 18 hours agoparentYes, however, by the time they fix the dictionary hack glue code as described, PCI bus transfer speeds will have increased (again).I’m a fan of making everything 64bit from an api level, but sometimes you have to work with the right type for the architecture. reply jackmott42 18 hours agoparentprevIn the context of function parameters at the edge of C# and c++ I don&#x27;t think it will ever amount to a large amount of memory being wasted. The cache point may be relevant, but generally if you are calling into C++ in tight loops from your scripting language in a game you have already screwed up. So maybe not so bad. reply jayd16 18 hours agorootparent>but generally if you are calling into C++ in tight loops from your scripting language in a game you have already screwed up.How do you figure? Are you saying there should be no tight loops that hit engine code, none that live in the C#&#x2F;scripting lifecycle or all tight loops should be rewritten in C++?The elephant in the room, Unity, cross compiles the C# to C++ which makes this blanket statement about all games even more confusing to me. reply badsectoracula 16 hours agorootparent> The elephant in the room, Unity, cross compiles the C# to C++ which makes this blanket statement about all games even more confusing to me.As a game developer you do not have access to Unity&#x27;s C++ code so to maintain some performance Unity needs to do that. But this is not the case with Godot or even Unreal where any intensive code should be written (or at least, rewritten) in C++ and use the scripts only to drive the behavior. reply jayd16 15 hours agorootparentThis seems inaccurate. You can certainly write C++ for Unity. People usually don&#x27;t. Its a pain and C# performance is good. IL2CPP allows the compiler to optimize across game and engine code so its rare to write C++ plugins. Unreal also supports generating C++ from blueprints.But saying &#x27;oh you shouldn&#x27;t use the nice language anyway&#x27; is just making excuses. Obviously they&#x27;re meant to be used to call engine code. reply johnnyanmac 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s such a bizarro world after a bunch of UE discussions to suddenly see people dismiss scripting concerns with \"well just write that code in C++. Blueprints is slow\". I&#x27;m usually the one saying that, but that&#x27;s as a professional developer who needs to optimize all that stuff (and TBH the blueprint code tends to have some bad performance choices even before discussing the BP perf loss).Hearing people dismiss the performance of something as basic as a raycast with \"well just code in C++\", while many people (including this founder) say that Godot focuses on simplicity sounds counter-intuitive. So is GDScript a lie for anything slightly intensive (and again, raycast. I&#x27;m using \"intense\" in the loosest of words) and I should simply make my whole game an engine module? But I keep hearing that \"I should just try GDScript it&#x27;s really easy and you come around to it!\"Feels like a motte and bailey. reply 3seashells 16 hours agorootparentprevTight loops mean:develope one specialized function call which gets a field of data and works on it.. Resurfacing after the job is done.You may even invert direction, handing over a pure script language function (no context) + the data, so the c++ engine may crunch the data at least in parallel small script vms without stack, similar to a shader. reply lainga 17 hours agorootparentprevI think part of the problem is that using GDExtension is like a two-way FFI. You can call (C++) extension functions from GDScript, but the same interface and overhead are used to call (lib) Godot functions from the (C++) extension. AFAIK it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s awith engine functions that the compiler could inline.Here&#x27;s a good example (look, there I am!), although it&#x27;s a bit old and actually led to perf improvement:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;godotengine&#x2F;godot-cpp&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1063 reply json2d 17 hours agoprev\"Godot is&#x2F;is not the new Unity\" is a pretty loaded statement, and would mean different things to different folks.This particular discussion focuses on the performance gap between the two engines looking specifically at how raycasts are implemented, and the larger implications from that analysis. reply stephc_int13 15 hours agoprevI think this type of discussion can help the design team behind Godot to improve their practices and implementation, in the end it would be very healthy for the gamedev community to have a reliable and performance open-source engine as the \"standard\" for students, indies and AA projects alike.Godot is better than Unity on many sides, but the internal architecture is coming from a place where they relied too much on naive and inefficient OOP constructs, those can be very hard to optimize later.Performance should not be treated as a second class citizen when creating an engine, there are always solutions but it can be very time consuming to find workarounds to palliate design issues with the engine, it can also be a real motivation killer for a small team when they discover the framerate of their game on older&#x2F;smaller devices... reply lukebitts 16 hours agoprevGreat response, I downloaded Godot because I was looking for a lightweight engine that doesn&#x27;t take two minutes to load. This seems to explain the reason for the performance, I&#x27;m glad its one of their focus reply marcodiego 17 hours agoprevOf course not. It won&#x27;t have a draconian license agreement. reply throwawayyy9237 1 hour agoprev> \"Godot is not production ready\"Personally, I find this a refreshing admission. reply philipov 16 hours agoprevOfftopic: BDFL is a funny initialism.

Returning a dictionary for an operation that has a few float64&#x27;s feels overkill and doesn&#x27;t make sense even with an explanation of the available datatypes.>Only a pathological use case is shown, the rest of the API is fine.I wouldn&#x27;t call raycasting in a full blown engine \"pathological\". Especially one that touts 3DSecondly, that doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence. \"Don&#x27;t mind the room on fire, the rest of the house is fine!\". The onus is on the engine to prove that, and numbers prevail over words. So far only one part of the conversation has shown that.Even in the next sentence it sounds like they focus on a simple API over performance, and that doesn&#x27;t fill me with confidence. If Godot isn&#x27;t focusing on 3D, that is fine but there&#x27;s so much noise trying to to say otherwise> Eventually, C# will be moved to the universal extension system and this will allow the unifying of the default and .net editors, it is just not the case yet, but its top in the list of prioritiesI hope so, but there seems to be a trend of various \"top priorities\" from Godot that have trouble crossing the finish line. That&#x27;s a reocurring issue even in this response alone: I&#x27;m not convinced that performance is a top priority for Godot. And that confidence means everything if the \"BDFL\" controls what gets into the project proper.>The problem is that, at the C++ level, this function takes a struct pointer for performance. But at the language binding API this is difficult to expose properly. This is very old code (dating to the opensourcing of Godot) and a Dictionary was hacked-in to use temporarily until something better is foundYup... so 10 years later that hack stays in and modern programmers come cross it.This isn&#x27;t even a critique, that&#x27;s simply the nature of legacy code. Unreal has an entire part of a forced namimg scheme (the compiler won&#x27;t let you run the game without conforming) that can only be explained as \"well we wanted to do this in the 90&#x27;s but we slowly took it out sp it&#x27;s not relevant today\". But if it took 10 years for someone to do more than a few dozen raycasts a frame, it says more about the battletesting than any deep dive. It goes back to my confidence above.>, you need to create a C# version of a C++ instance as an adapter... Why is it troublesome? because C# has a garbage collector and C++ does not.slight nitpick: while garbage collection is annoying, you technically do have a built in way to disable it in certain regions, as well as the option in later versions to have unmanaged blocks of code. I&#x27;m not saying this is easy to do, but it is something that developers much smarter than me in c# have gotten around. I know c# bindings was a relatively recent endeavor so I&#x27;m not going to give it too much flak> Godot containers don&#x27;t work like STL containers. Because they are used mainly to pass data around, they are allocated once and then kept via reference counting.1) reference counting implies some sort of automated memory free-ing scheme. 2) That doesn&#x27;t necessarily address potential issues of inefficiently allocating memory and keeping it contiguous. But I won&#x27;t talk much on that because I&#x27;d need to first read more on the engine&#x27;s memory allocating schemes first.> Godot uses far more optimized containers that are not directly exposed to the binder API.Okay, but why? Someone wanting to use C# or c++ or whatever script extension that isn&#x27;t GDScript wants those optimized containers. Does it go back to the earlier quote of \"it&#x27;s difficult to get right and no one wanted it\"?>As a result, we created a special path for GDScript to call more efficiently.okay, and the link is... an open issue on Github made 2 months ago, with no additional comments or discussions. Simply a request from a code owner.I don&#x27;t know if this conversation is simply happening in IRC&#x2F;chat, but it&#x27;s unusual given how much other activity I have seen in other PR&#x27;s&#x2F;proposals (recent and from years prior). Was this the best reassurance that they are addressing performance?---------I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a downer, but I feel the article is overall missing the forest for the trees. I&#x27;ve read about several different kinds of devs from years prior talk about how they passed on Godot because they hit hitch after hitch once they were doing something slightly advanced. a dismissal of \"this is a pathological use case\" sounds fine in a vacuum, but it sounds like this has been a long standing issue, and priorities simply weren&#x27;t on smoothing out such hitches.I&#x27;m not saying they should have listened to those devs, but I think the most frustrating thing is that I don&#x27;t know what or who Godot wants to service. So far it sounds like they want to have all the cake, but currently are also low-key fine being a hobbyist 2D engine that can maybe do some simple 3D stuff. Which again, is fine. But that&#x27;s not what it sounds like Godot is selling. It unfortunately reminds me a lot of Unity, both on the outside (yeah, having 2 unsupported netcode solutions with a 3rd in pre-alpha isn&#x27;t a good look) and within the company itself. I&#x27;ll quote some part of a post from the creator of Rimworld, who had similar evaluation and conclusions over 5 years ago:>There&#x27;s obviously a tremendous amount of technical talent going into Godot, but from what I can tell there&#x27;s no strategic thought about market positioning or success pathways or goal pillars at all. It basically comes down to \"make a good game engine\", with all the lack of boundaries and lack of focus that implies.>My initial thought: Be best at one valuable thing first, then expand out from there into adjacent domains, using the momentum accrued from the initial success. (e.g. If you want to build a restaurant empire, you start with one restaurant to dominate one neighborhood and then expand from there - you don&#x27;t try to build 100 restaurants at once). reply imtringued 4 hours agoprev>Additionally, modern processors all have at minimum 64 bit buses, so exposing anything other than 64 bit scalar types makes no sense.Yeah but you have a 32 bit data type and a packed 32 bit array, so why not have the same for 16 bit?

Released on 26/02/2011 in Japan, 25/03/2011 in Europe and 27/03/2011 in America. A quick introduction As smartphones surge in adoption, the videogame market is experiencing an unusual growth led by discount App Stores and affordable development licenses. With this, one can only wonder when kids will prefer an iPhone 4 over a Nintendo DSi. In the midst of finding out the answer, Nintendo conceives a thrilling successor to its triumphant portable system. In it, users will find old, present and unfamiliar technology - many of which can’t be replicated by smartphones. And so, this new production of the Architecture of Consoles series will give you a profound description of how this new console works, both internally and externally. Recommended reading If you are new to this article series, I strongly suggest reading the GameCube, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS articles beforehand, as they will explain various terms and concepts referenced in this one. Models and variants Throughout the lifecycle (and struggles) of this console, Nintendo released numerous revisions in an attempt to correct its target audience and recover loyal customers. An original Nintendo 3DS (the first generation, from 2011) next to a New Nintendo 3DS XL (the last generation, from 2015). From the architectural point of view, there were a total of six different models: Nintendo 3DS (2011) and Nintendo 3DS XL (2012): The debuting series featuring the original architecture. The only relevant difference between the XL and non-XL models is the screen size. Nintendo 2DS (2013): A cheaper alternative to the original Nintendo 3DS by removing the stereoscopic screen and featuring a Game Boy-inspired shape. New Nintendo 3DS (2014) and New Nintendo 3DS XL (2015): A re-engineering of the standard 3DS models. The ‘New’ variants exhibit an incremental hardware upgrade, an NFC reader, a larger button set and an improved stereoscopic system. New Nintendo 2DS XL (2017): The ‘New’ affordable alternative to the New Nintendo 3DS XL by omitting stereoscopic functionality. Now, for this article, the focus will be on the original Nintendo 3DS (after all, it’s the lowest common denominator for games). However, since the architectural differences of the ‘New’ series are worth studying, these will receive a dedicated section. Displays There’s only one company that keeps altering the standard structure of all my analyses, and that’s Nintendo. This time, I’ll start with the stereoscopic screens (a.k.a. ‘3D without glasses’). First things first, the Nintendo 3DS, as a successor of the Nintendo DS, includes two LCD screens. The upper screen has a resolution of 800 x 240 pixels and somehow can display images with a sense of depth. When I first read this, only questions popped into my head: What optics principles are they applying? How is the screen designed? How do games comply with this system? Well, here are the answers! Principles Liked or not, the fundamentals are not so different from the Virtual Boy, which I’ve happened to analyse two years before. To recall, the Virtual Boy displays two images, one to each eye, and shows objects individually shifted from the centre. By looking at the two pictures at the same time, they are perceived as some objects are behind others (sense of depth). This is the basis of Stereoscopic Parallax. Left Right Left display. Demonstration of how the Virtual Boy displayed stereoscopic imagery. Mario’s Tennis (1995). Now, the way the Virtual Boy executed this was a bit cumbersome: it required users to place their heads close to the eyepiece and then adjust the focal length and inter-pupil distance. 15 years later, Nintendo rightly said ‘No’ to all of that nuisance, and designed a new system where users could enjoy 3D-looking scenery without considerable intervention. Left Right Top screen, left eye. An example of two frames the Nintendo 3DS shows on its top screen at the same time. Looks like the fish is going to hit you. The same principle applies 15 years later. Luigi’s Mansion (2018). This brings us to our next question. The special screen Take a look again at the resolution of the upper LCD screen. On paper, it says it’s 800 x 240 pixels wide, which results in a ludicrous aspect ratio. The Nintendo 3DS again [1], take a closer look at its screens. In reality, the physical screen is made of half-width pixels and operates in two modes: Traditional/2D mode: When the stereoscopic function is disabled, groups of two horizontal pixel pairs are treated as a single one. Truth be told, the screen can still display a frame of 800 x 240 px, although no commercial game ever used this. Stereoscopic/3D mode: All pixels are treated individually, and with it, the screen displays two frames of 400 x 240 pixels at the same time. Moreover, to perform stereoscopic parallax, this particular LCD houses an extra layer called Parallax Barrier [2]. These opaque shutters deviate the backlight beamed behind the pixels of the LCD, so each eye will receive the light of a different subset of pixels [3]. The half-width pixels will also appear to be wider, thereby giving the feeling they have the traditional aspect ratio. All in all, this recreates the original effect of the Virtual Boy without requiring controls for adjustment. The technology is not perfect, however, as there are a few caveats: The parallax barrier requires extra brightness, thereby impacting the battery life. The user must not hold the screen in a tilted position (compared to the user’s eyes). Otherwise, the user will end up seeing a confusing mix of the two parallax frames, which can be a disorienting experience. Not to mention the eyes won’t enjoy the extra fatigue. Combining the fact the user must maintain a fixed posture while playing, and that stereoscopic parallax can tire the eyes quicker. The 3D feature, as a whole, can be an unnecessary hassle for most. My attempt to capture the tilt effect of the original 3DS. The 3D depth slider (at the right side of the screen) is all the way up, and by looking at the screen from one side, a ghosting effect appears on the top screen. This is quite eye-straining to look at in reality! To remediate things, Nintendo added a slider control (called 3D depth slider) to adjust the level of depth between objects. In doing so, it either increases or decreases the difference between the two frames. This was done to reduce the depth effect for people who didn’t find it enjoyable or too fatiguing. Setting the 3D slider to the max can be disorienting at first. In my experience, my eyes eventually got focused, at which point I perceived the top LCD screen as if I were looking through a window. The main problem is that users will need to continuously shift their eyes to see the bottom screen, and the repeated action can be very straining. As a side note, one can’t help but find it amusing how the graphics pipeline has gone full circle when rendering stereoscopic frames. During rendering, 3D data is projected into a 2D space, and now with the stereoscopic screen, that 2D space is displayed again as 3D. At this point, let’s just use holograms and skip the 3D projection stage altogether. A small update Top part of the New 3DS XL. At its centre, there’s a front camera and an infrared LED, both used for head tracking. With the advent of the ‘New 3DS’ model, Nintendo revisioned their stereoscopic screen in an effort to reach enjoyability levels. In the new model, the console incorporates a face-tracking mechanism to tackle the tilting effect, so issues don’t need to worry about keeping a good head-console posture anymore. The special games Now for this system to work, games must play along (pun intended). Just like they traditionally interact with the GPU to draw frames on the display, they must now broadcast two frames of the scenery but with objects slightly shifted. To make life easier for developers, there are official APIs that assist in this, especially for those games with 3D sceneries. These APIs help by providing routines that construct two projection matrices, the graphics pipeline then uses them to render the two slightly-shifted frames. CPU Now that we know how the display works, let’s look at the internals of this console. If you get a hold of the motherboard, you’ll see three big chips, one being the CPU CTR. That’s the big System-On-Chip (SoC) that houses the entire system (aside from storage and RAM). CPU CTR next to some FCRAM CPU CTR follows the design methods of previous portable consoles from Nintendo. That is, squash all your engineering into a single block. In doing so, it will reduce the production of counterfeits, protect sensible components and improve heat dissipation. In terms of the actual CPU, Nintendo partnered again with their old friend, ARM, to produce their next-generation core. ARM’s licensing model happens to be favourable to Nintendo as they have always offered synthesisable designs, which allows Nintendo to mould to their needs (including, fitting them into a big SoC). In the end, ARM gave them a relatively antiquated with substantial upgrades. Their choice was the ARM11 core, a successor of the ARM9 (featured with the Nintendo DS). More specifically, the MPCore variant, ARM’s first homogenous multi-core solution. Using ARM’s designs, Nintendo crafted an ARM11 MPCore cluster housing two ARM11 cores [4]. Three years later, with the arrival of the ‘New’ 3DS, the SoC was expanded to contain four ARM11 cores. The effects of this will be explained in due time so, before anything else, let’s analyse what the new CPU cores offered to this console. An iconic industry The ARM11 series originates from 2002, as a successor of the popular ARM9 and the short-lived ARM10. A Nokia 5230 (2009), a red 3DS (2011) and a Raspberry Pi Model B (2012), all carrying an ARM11. In case you haven’t heard about them before, ARM11s are best known for powering the 2006-2008 generation of smartphones (back when many of them featured a keypad or a clamshell design). If you owned a Nokia N95, 5230 or the first iPhone, you’ve used an ARM11. This also applied to many high-end cameras, GPS or similar peripherals. If you wonder, other manufacturers like RIM and Samsung held onto Intel XScale (the continuation of StrongARM, implementing the ARMv5TE instruction set) until 2009, when they made the switch to ARM11 (this is a bit ironic, considering the iPhone’s CPU was supplied by Samsung!). Last but not least, the ARM11 was the choice of the CPU for the first model of the Raspberry Pi. Now, by the time Nintendo adopted the ARM11, its creator had already succeeded it with the Cortex-A series. This is nothing but expected, as Nintendo’s model favours cost-effectiveness over avant-garde CPUs. Look at it from another way, saving in CPU costs allows them to focus their budget on other aspects of the console, you’ll soon see. New dialects… Along with the new shiny CPUs, a new instruction set arrived, the ARMv6. From a programmer’s perspective, the ARMv6 ISA innovates with a new set of vector instructions and multi-core support [5]. The new vector set provides SIMD instructions that operate groups of four 8-bit values or two 16-bit values at the same time (using the existing 32-bit registers) [6]. The new multi-core instructions consist of Store and Load opcodes with special care for synchronisation (crucial for an environment of multiple CPUs using the same memory locations) [7]. All in all, this may not seem that thriving for a new chip series, but remember that ARM’s CPUs speak many ‘languages’. In the case of an ARM11-based core, you are provided with: The main 32-bit ISA, called ARMv6. A compressed alternative called Thumb. Its instructions fit in 16-bit words instead. If you’d like to know more, I go over it in the Game Boy Advance article, as it weighs significant importance in that console. Jazelle, a Java bytecode interpreter, mostly forgotten and left unused. I’ve mentioned a bit of it in the Wii article. Any extension bundled into the core. For instance, the MPCore includes a Vector Floating-point Coprocessor with additional instructions to control said coprocessor [8]. To make matters less confusing, ARM tends to package all of these with a single nomenclature. For instance, in the case of the ARM11 MPCore opcodes, ARM refers to them as the ARMv6k instruction set. … and a fragmented distribution The adoption of extensions and alternative instruction sets eventually made things very convoluted for developers targeting generic ARM hardware, you only have to look at the uncountable ARM ports devised for Linux distributions. Debian, one of the most popular distributions, tried to tackle the disparities by developing two ports in parallel: armel: unoptimized, compatible with ARMv4T onwards. armhf: accelerated with VFP, but only compatible with ARMv7 onwards. Yet, with the arrival of the Raspberry Pi (powered by ARMv6 and accelerated with VFP), neither of them was deemed acceptable. Thus, an unofficial port called ‘Raspbian’ was developed to provide a VFP-accelerated version for ARMv6 CPUs [9]. Even so, the trend continued: years later, with the arrival of ARMv8 and AArch64, Debian spawned yet-another port, arm64, optimised for the new 64-bits ISA. I don’t remember seeing this labyrinth with x86, but at least things are now getting more orderly. AArch64 has unified many extensions and dropped alternative modes (farewell, Thumb and Jazelle). Core functionality That was a big deviation. Let’s go back to the 3DS CPU, the ARM11, and check what’s inside. For this study, we can divide the ARM11 MPCore into two areas: The MP11 cores that make up the cluster. The Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) bus, a new invention that interconnects the cores and interfaces with the outside world. Let’s start with the cores now and then we’ll check the AXI bus. The original MPCore The ‘New’ MPCore The AXI bus Overview of the ARM11 MPCore CPU cluster The first ARM11 MPCore variant, which debuted with the original 3DS, includes two cores. Each is called MP11 and runs at 268 MHz [10]. Apart from implementing the ARMv6k instruction set, the CPU features an 8-stage pipeline [11]. Furthermore, the core provides two levels of branch prediction, ‘dynamic’ (based on previous executions) and ‘static’ (based on the current instruction alone). Overall, both enhancements will be quickly noticed, considering the 5-stage ARM9 couldn’t predict a thing! Additionally, since the ARM946E-S CPU, ARM has been fitting a System Control Coprocessor called CP15. This time, it provides Memory-Management (MMU functions) and registers that output information about the MPCore cluster. Now, there’s no more Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM). There are however 16 KB of instruction cache and 16 KB of data cache, this change of model resembles other systems of the same generation. If you are curious, this L1 cache is 4-way set associative. Finally, each core houses a co-processor called Vector Floating-point Coprocessor (also known as ‘VFP11’). This accelerates arithmetic operations with floating-point numbers, both 32-bit single-precision (a.k.a. float) and 64-bit double-precision (a.k.a. double) ones [12]. It’s not a big coprocessor though, as its register file is composed of 32 32-bit registers, so doubles will consume two registers. In any case, this processor implements the VFPv2 instruction set and follows the IEEE 754 standard. The latter is a welcomed decision, considering the architecture of previous generations. Next » Any other CPUs? Up to this moment, I’ve been talking about the MPCore as if it were the only CPU in this system, the reason being mixing up distinct CPUs for this analysis can turn it into an incomprehensible essay. That is, until now. The truth is, Nintendo had extra requirements for this console. They wanted a proper security system, but also the possibility to turn the console into a Nintendo DSi or a GBA on-the-fly. So, for all of that, they ended up bundling three distinct CPU packages - one being the mentioned ARM11. The other two are well hidden, in the sense that games are completely unaware of them. In fact, 3DS emulators like Citra don’t care about them either [15]. The Nintendo 3DS next to a predecessor (a Nintendo DS Lite), the latter has become a common denominator. But we do! Here’s the complete list of CPUs this system houses: The ARM11 MPCore we’ve just seen. An ARM946E-S from the Nintendo DS days. It’s treated as a secret co-processor and it’s only managed by the operating system. Alternatively, it becomes the main processor whenever a DS or DSi game is executed. Thanks to its bundled CP15 co-processor, there’s a Memory Protection Unit (MPU) in place. This will protect the CPU from arbitrarily executing code from any location in memory. An ARM7TDMI from the Game Boy Advance days. It’s a relatively ignored CPU, unless a DS or DSi game is being played, in which case it acts as a co-processor. However, on the special occasion when a Game Boy Advanced game is running, the main execution falls into this CPU. Unfortunately, or for obvious reasons, the three CPUs are never usable at the same time. Instead, the console has three modes of operation: Native 3DS mode: The ARM11 MPCore executes a 3DS game while the ARM946E-S deals with I/O and security. The ARM7, on the other side, is switched off. Nintendo DSi mode: The ARM946E-S and ARM7TDMI operate in a multi-processor configuration to execute a Nintendo DS or DSi game. Just like with its predecessor, the ARM7TDMI has greater access to I/O. Meanwhile, the ARM11 MPCore will be working in the background to replicate missing and re-located DS hardware (real-time clock, power management, keypad, GBA/DS PPU display and so forth). Game Boy Advance mode: The ARM7TDMI is the only CPU executing instructions (in 99% of cases, that will come from a GBA game). The ARM11 MPCore and ARM9, both still operating within the capacities of ‘Native 3DS mode’, will be working in the background. If you stop to think about it, the Nintendo 3DS ends up housing four processors in total (Two MP11 cores + one ARM9 + one ARM7), or the absurd amount of six in the case of the New 3DS. How convoluted is that? Luckily, this system didn’t suffer the complications of the Sega Saturn and you can thank Nintendo and ARM’s engineering for that. After all, 3DS developers only had to deal with the MPCore. Since the ARM9 and ARM7 are predominantly for I/O, security and backwards compatibility (neither of which require the developer’s awareness), I discuss them in later sections of this article. But if you’d like to know more about the design of the ARM7 and ARM9, I wrote about them in previous articles (the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS ones, respectively). Multi-core communication I guess the question now is, how can CPUs and cores talk to each other? Well, the easiest way is to share RAM… but you could also try a more efficient approach, depending on the cores trying to communicate: Representation of the communication channels each CPU is provided with. With inter-core ARM11 communication, a core can send interrupts to another core by writing on its Software Interrupt Register [16]. In the case of ARM11↔︎ARM9 or ARM9↔︎ARM7 communication, the same FIFO model from the Nintendo DS is implemented. Plus, the ARM11↔︎ARM9 FIFO is also called ‘PXI’ [17]. Memory available Having three different CPUs also means the memory layout will not be simple, especially if you care about security. Overview of memory organisation on the Nintendo 3DS. To make a long story short, we’ve got the following blocks: From the developer’s perspective, the system provides 128 MB of FCRAM. The New 3DS increased this to 256 MB. The rest is redundant for games. For predominantly security reasons, the ARM11 is also provided with a fast block of 512 KB of SRAM. The ARM9 is also given a block of 1 MB of SRAM (1.5 MB in the case of the New 3DS). By inheriting the model of the Nintendo DS, the ARM9 also houses Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM). Particularly, there’s 32 KB for instructions and 16 KB for data. A new type of memory spotted It’s all jolly that the Nintendo 3DS includes 32 times the general-purpose memory of its predecessor, but what about that ‘FCRAM’? Is it any different from the other standards? Well, Fast Cycle DRAM (FCRAM) is yet another RAM invention, this time authored in 2002 by Fujitsu and Toshiba. Presented as an alternative to DRAM-based technology (i.e. SDRAM, EDO DRAM, RDRAM, etc.), FCRAM excels on non-continuous reads, where it exhibits a lower latency than DRAM [18]. This was done to replicate the performance offered by the more expensive SRAM. FCRAM competes directly with DDR DRAM by offering a revamped design of the memory arrays. In place of adding more circuitry on top of it, arrays are split into smaller subblocks, which are then accessed using a 3-stage pipeline [19]. In doing so, reading and writing on random locations become faster. These changes are still designed with backwards compatibility in mind. Thus, FCRAM is compatible with DDR DRAM controllers (hence, its full name is ‘DDR FCRAM’). Faster memory transfers The inventors of the MPCore and the AMBA bus happen to also offer a brand of DMA controllers called CoreLink, with Nintendo being a loyal client. So, it’s no mystery as to why the 3DS bundles multiple blocks of CoreLink DMA-330 into their SoC [20]. These DMAs in particular are attached to an AXI bus and act as master devices. They can transfer data between two slaves interconnected with the AMBA protocol (either AXI or the slower APB) with the following advantages: Faster transfer rates compared to either CPU. Support of up to eight channels (eight transfers at the same time) [21]. To be precise, Nintendo fitted one CoreLink DMA next to the ARM9, this is referred to as XDMA and provides up to four channels. There’s another DMA next to the ARM11 block, this time called CDMA, which provides up to eight channels. With the arrival of the New 3DS, another CoreLink DMA-330 is fitted next to the ARM11 block (now a quad-core cluster). Programming With all being said, how do you program a system featuring this unorthodox CPU arrangement? To be fair, unusual systems are no strangers to videogame developers. But in this case, 3DS programmers only have access to the ARM11 MPCore. Furthermore, once you reach the ‘Operating System’ section, you’ll learn the abilities with this cluster are further restricted. In any case, no matter the console revision, programmers base their algorithms on the multi-threading model: the program groups sequences of instructions using threads, these are then dispatched by the operating system to the physical cores, as the former deems fit. Once a novelty for Xbox 360 software, this standard provides a layer of abstraction that blinds the developers from writing software only compatible with a fixed number and type of CPU cores. Dealing with the ‘New’ hardware Since the New 3DS diverts considerably from the original specification, Nintendo set up a thin compatibility layer to enable old 3DS games to work with the new hardware without manual intervention. In essence, when a game is launched from a New 3DS console, the game’s code specifies if it’s specifically targeting the new models or not [22]. If it is, the operating system will proceed to activate all the novelties (faster clock speed, extra RAM and use of L2 cache) for that game to enjoy. If it’s not, the operating system will keep its exclusive hardware deactivated until the user exits the game, so the game can safely assume it’s running on the old hardware and will do so without issue. To keep supporting the old 3DS, games can be packaged with two codebases (one for the ‘New’ model and the other for the ‘Old’ one). It’s up to the game studios to decide whether to support the old and new 3DS, or only the new 3DS. You may be wondering what happens with the rest of the exclusive hardware the New 3DS houses (i.e. extra ARM11 cores and DMA). Well, to properly understand the rationale, I explain this once you reach the ‘Operating System’ section, but I’m afraid you won’t like the answer! Graphics Next to a new CPU is always a modern GPU. So, what kind of Picture Processing Unit did Nintendo build this time? To tell the truth, none. For the first time in their portable line, they resorted to a GPU supplier. Nevertheless, the requirements of Nintendo haven’t shifted. The company still wanted a chip with acceptable performance… and the intellectual property. This will allow them to embed the GPU into their SoC, in the same way they did with the ARM CPUs. Kart Sonic Mario Animal Zelda Mario Kart 7 (2011) Example of Nintendo 3DS games. All render two frames of 400 x 240 pixels and one frame of 320 x 240 pixels. Meanwhile, a potential candidate just finished unveiling their new invention at SIGGRAPH 2006 [23]. For some time, Digital Media Professionals Inc. (also known as ‘DMP’) have been building affordable GPUs for the embedded market and, while their chips are nothing out of the ordinary, they guarantee decent OpenGL ES support. Furthermore, their licensing framework offers synthesisable GPUs. This seemed enough for Nintendo, who happily negotiated a license for DMP’s latest core, the PICA200 and subsequently bundled it on CTR CPU (the Nintendo 3DS’ SoC). The GPU runs at 268 MHz. Architecture of the PICA200 If I had to summarise it in one sentence, the PICA200 is a budget low-power 3D processor that combines a pre-unified architecture with a modernised API. The underlying architecture of the PICA200 is called Maestro 2G [24] and its design is compliant with OpenGL ES 1.1, but extended with elements from OpenGL ES 2.0 [25]. However, the PICA200’s APIs are not limited to either standard. You see, even though the pipeline is segregated and the pixel stage is fixed-function (ala PlayStation 2), DMP expanded the limited circuitry with a set of Maestro functions that provide capabilities beyond the expectations of the embedded market [26]. This includes fragment lighting, multiple shadowing algorithms, polygon subdivision, bump mapping, procedural textures and many fog effects. Additionally and in contrast to the Nintendo DS, the PICA200 only works with framebuffers. That’s it. The sprite engine, a popular workaround to tackle unaffordable memory requirements, is now a thing of the past. This also includes scan-line tricks, as contemporary GPUs work way faster than the refresh rate of a CRT. Organising the content Now that we know that this console can draw 3D shapes, the question now is: where does it store its materials? There are two locations, the large FCRAM block and the smaller but faster VRAM. Nintendo only provided 6 MB of VRAM exclusively for the GPU. Ideally, programmers would fit as much as they can there, but since it will fill up pretty quickly, it is expected to be used to store data that needs instant access (i.e. commands, buffers and recurrent textures) while placing the rest on FCRAM. The PICA200 comes with a DMA unit that can transfer data between FCRAM and VRAM. So, at the end of the day, it’s the responsibility of the programmer to come up with an efficient placement to avoid bottlenecks. Example of how data is organised across the memory available. During rendering, programmers allocate dedicated render buffers (i.e. frame, stencil, depth, etc.) for many operations. That’s always been the case. With the 3DS, alongside these buffers, programmers are also expected to reserve extra space for Display buffers, these are bound to the physical screens. The 3DS requires to allocate three Display buffers (two for the stereoscopic upper screen and one for the bottom one). To give you an idea, the display process works as follows: The LCD continuously displays the content of the front (active) Display buffer, as instructed by the value of the buffer index. Meanwhile, the GPU finishes rendering geometry in a framebuffer. The framebuffer is exported to the back (inactive) Display buffer. The GPU swaps the index of the front Display buffer. For practical reasons, the index swap should happen at the end of Vertical Sync to avoid tearing down the picture [27]. The official APIs provide synchronisation functions to keep all operations at the correct pace. The LCD will now be scanning the recently updated Display buffer from now on. Adopting open standards On an interesting note, just like the ARM11 MPCore adopts ARM’s AXI protocol for interconnecting its cores, DMP adopted a less-proprietary option called Open Core Protocol (OCP) [28]. As its name indicates, the Open Core protocol does not impose any licensing restrictions on its users, something that vendors using the PICA200 may find advantageous. For comparison purposes, AXI was released in 2003 (along with the AMBA 3 specification) while OCP was published in 2001. It does make me wonder what kind of technology Nintendo fitted to adapt the OCP signal coming from the PICA200 into an AXI-compliant signal, so the rest of the SoC understands it. I assume that there’s a bridge between the PICA200 and the AXI bus. Interestingly enough, the predecessor of the PICA200, the ULTRAY2000, shares many similarities with its successor. The most notable difference, however, is that the data interfaces use the PCI and DDR-SDRAM protocols instead [29]. Constructing the frame Naturally, the GPU is not aware of the stereoscopic or dual-screen nature of the displays, it will only be tasked with rendering three screens during gameplay: Top stereoscopic-left: 400 x 240 pixels wide. Top stereoscopic-right: 400 x 240 pixels wide. Bottom: 320 x 240 pixels wide. All of them can display 8-bit RGB colours, which equates to up to 16.78 million colours. Considering players will expect acceptable frame rates on all three screens (especially on the first two), the single PICA200 will be subject to high amounts of workload throughout its operation, an important aspect to remember when judging its performance. That being said, here is an overview of how data travels to draw a single frame: Overview of the graphics pipeline in PICA200. … and as customary in this series of articles, we’ll now take a look at what happens at each stage. Commands Vertex Geometry Rasteriser Fragment Post-processing Overview of the command stage. This is Nintendo’s first portable console to finally draw triangles in ‘the usual way’. That is, with the use of commands. But it’s not a surprising factor, as the PICA200 is expected to abide by the teachings of OpenGL ES. In essence, the PICA200 draws polygons by reading a command buffer [30]. Furthermore, the vertex data can either be embedded within the command or stored in a separate buffer in VRAM, with the latter being the most efficient. Next » Interactive comparison Now that you’ve seen how the PICA200 draws its triangles on the screen, it’s time for some practical examples. Here I’ve gathered two Marios from Smash Bros games, the Wii and 3DS one. Notice how the level of detail of ‘angry Mario’ hasn’t changed that much, considering we’re comparing a 2006 home console with its 2011 portable. Wireframe Surface Textured Tap to enable interaction Super Smash Bros Brawl (2008) for the Wii. 3,049 triangles. Wireframe Surface Textured Tap to enable interaction Super Smash Bros. for 3DS (2014). 3,080 triangles. It’s worth reminding again that, in practice, the PICA200 will be rendering three screens at the same time, something that the Wii’s GPU wasn’t subjected to. Nostalgic rendering After all that’s been explained, there’s one question left unanswered: How does the PICA200 render Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advanced games? You may remember that the DS and GBA’s GPU exhibit completely different modus operandi for rendering and broadcasting frames. A frame rendered by the Nintendo DS’ Graphics Engine, whose pipeline segregates between 2D and 3D data. That’s something the OpenGL-compliant PICA200 doesn’t understand. The explanation is that the DS and GBA PPUs are housed in the SoC and DSi/DS/GBA games will operate them as they originally did on previous consoles. The PPUs output (scanlines) is delivered to a block called LgyFB, which may optionally upscale the frame, and then forwarded to the framebuffer, where the PICA200 will take care of displaying it. It’s the job of the ARM11 and its DMA to take care of all memory transfers during this process. Naturally, this arrangement will add some delay (a.k.a. lag), albeit negligible to the user. Audio Overall, the SoC houses two audio blocks: A proprietary DSP exclusively programmed for sound operations. This is used by 3DS games. A variant of the Nintendo DS audio block named CSND. 3DS, DS and GBA games use it. The 3DS-only hardware You may know that this same DSP was previously bundled with the Nintendo DSi, but treated as an optional accelerator instead. With the 3DS, it’s become the designated audio processor, so it’s no longer a voluntary component. The DSP is called CEVA TeakLite II [39] and operates at ~134 MHz [40]. It’s manufactured by ParthusCeva, a company that provides synthesisable cores for audio processing [41], and I guess ‘synthesisable’ was the keyword Nintendo was looking for when they partnered. Moving on, the DSP outputs stereo samples (2 channels) of up to 32 kHz of sampling rate and 16-bit resolution. Next to this component, we can find 512 KB of RAM that is used by the DSP as a working area. It’s double-buffered (256 KB per buffer), so both the CPU and DSP can read and write without interruption [42]. Apart from that, the DSP comes with a dedicated DMA that can transfer data in and out of those 512 KB. Operation For all intents and purposes, games treat this as an opaque DSP. Thus, only Nintendo knows how to program it. 3DS programs, as a consequence of being developed using the official SDK, bundle a DSP firmware (solely authored by Nintendo) which is then uploaded to the DSP chip at runtime [43]. Afterwards, programs rely on that firmware to execute audio-related routines. Furthermore, the audio services provided by the operating system further abstract the communication between the program and the DSP’s firmware [44]. In any case, while the DSP firmware may change over the years, some capabilities have remained the same. For instance, the DSP can mix ADPCM and PCM samples. with support of up to 24 channels [45]. There’s also functionality for filtering and sequencing, including the generation of PSG-like sounds. Interestingly enough, the steps followed for hacking the 3DS (so it can execute homebrew application) optionally involve extracting the HOME Menu’s DSP firmware, so homebrew may use it to provide audio output [46]. The backwards-compatible block At the other end of the spectrum, we find the CSND block. 3DS may use it as an extension of the DSP and DS/DSi/GBA games rely on it to replicate their hardware. In terms of functionality, the CSND features 32 channels [47], which is twice the amount of the Nintendo DS counterpart. Curiously enough, early homebrew defaulted to this block for providing sounds, while waiting for the DSP to be reverse-engineered. Pipeline Both DSP and CSND work independently and separately output their audio to the speaker. Overview of the audio pipeline. As a curious note, the original Nintendo 3DS didn’t play well with the speaker’s capabilities, as Nintendo ended up providing troubleshooting guides for cases of buzzing noises and fluctuations with 3D slider [48], all caused by the design of the case. I/O This section tends to be very rich in technologies considering Nintendo’s consoles favour generous I/O before state-of-the-art CPUs and GPUs. Let’s see what the Nintendo 3DS offers. External interfaces and peripherals The Nintendo DS had tons of modules built-in and the Nintendo DSi added more on top of it (after removing the GBA Slot). Now we found ourselves with a new console combining interfaces from two decades (the 2000s and 2010s). Main diagram of the console’s architecture. You can sense that the I/O area on the left side was a strong selling point of this console. To be fair, we still don’t have a standard like USB, but that may be expendable considering the Nintendo 3DS bundles the following: A keypad composed of digital buttons, an analogue circle pad. 3D and volume sliders. A Wi-Fi switch. A resistive touch sensor on the bottom screen. A gyroscope measuring the console’s rotation changes. An accelerometer to measure the console’s motion. One front camera and two back cameras, the latter allowing to take stereoscopic pictures. An infrared transceiver, used to transfer data between external accessories. An SD card slot, serving as external storage. A standard 3.5 mm jack socket for headphones. A game card reader, where 3DS, DSi and DS retail games are read from. The ‘New’ enhancements If that wasn’t enough, the New 3DS came with more modules on top. This includes: Two extra digital buttons and an extra analogue circle pad (called ‘C-Stick’). An NFC Reader on the bottom screen. An infrared LED, reserved for head tracking. The SD slot is replaced with a microSD slot. The Wi-Fi switch has been removed, now it’s only controlled through software. Now, to prevent leaving ‘old’ users behind, Nintendo provided external accessories to enhance the old models, although most of them relied on the single infrared transceiver to connect. Thus, only one accessory could be connected at the same time. Front view of the New Nintendo 3DS XL and the original 3DS, notice the different button sets each one offers. The original 3DS with the SD slot opened. Here you can see the two back cameras, the SD slot and an audio jack port. With the New 3DS, the microSD can’t be replaced without taking the back cover is taken off. Not all the exclusive features of the New 3DS can be replicated, however. For instance, the New 3DS’ head tracking mechanism depends on the extra ARM11 core. Internal interfaces Now it’s time to check how are these interfaces - and others - internally wired up. Firstly, a large subset is interconnected with the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. There are four SPI buses and all of them are accessed by the ARM9 (which I assume also includes the ARM7). The ARM11 only has access to most of them [49]. In any case, the SPI buses connect the following modules [50]: The flash memory found inside 3DS game cards, for storing save data. DS’ Power Management. Parts of the Wi-Fi chip. Touch screen. Sound. Microphone. Circle Pad. Curiously enough, some peripherals are interfaced twice to replicate the old DS/DSi’s I/O layout and also provide extended capabilities for 3DS software. Secondly, there’s a Human-interface device (HID) module connected to both ARM11 and ARM9 data buses. This is how the digital keypad is accessed. The data is read through a 16-bit register. Moving on, we got an I²C block which uses a more sophisticated serial protocol. This is connected to the following [51]: Front camera, also works in DSi mode. Two back cameras, the right camera is accessible in DSi mode as well. Infrared transceiver. The NFC interface, in the case of the New 3DS. The ‘QTM’ module, used for head-tracking (New 3DS only). Gyroscope. MCU chip, a separate controller that interfaces more components (explained in the next section). Finally, there are various registers interfacing FIFO blocks which, in turn, connect to two relatively high-speed (16 MB/s) peripherals [52]: Internal eMMC memory. SD card slot. The supplemental computer As confusing as it may sound, there’s more hardware left to discuss. The rest is handled by a middle-man chip called Auxiliary Microcontroller (MCU) [53]. This is just a microcontroller designed by NEC and manufactured by Renesas. Particularly, the model 78K0R, which bundles a proprietary (yet low-power and relatively modern) processor and a ROM [54]. The 78K0R stores a firmware handled by the console’s operating system, both ARM9 and ARM11 can interact with it but so do other peripherals. The MCU chip exclusively controls the following [55] [56]: Accelerometer. LCD screens. LED indicators. Power Management. Battery fuel gauge and rejection (whether to enable the charging circuitry or not). Wi-Fi’s EEPROM. Real-Time Clock (RTC). 3D slider and Wi-Fi switch, the latter is only found on old 3DS models. HOME and power buttons. A subset of this group is already accessible by the main CPUs. This is because the MCU also perform monitoring tasks, thereby saving resources from the ARM11 or ARM9. Ready for trends With such a heavy list of I/O hardware, you can now see how Nintendo tried to compete against the smartphone market. This led to interesting services deployed throughout the console’s lifecycle: A QR Reader bundled with the camera app. AR Games: Nintendo shipped ‘AR Cards’ that could be scanned with the 3DS camera using an app called ‘AR Games’. This would make static Nintendo characters pop up in your room, like any traditional augmented-reality-based application. Face Riders: Another camera-based app, but in this case, takes a photo of the player to compose the game’s characters. The player must then use the gyroscope and microphone to battle his/her evil clones. Amiibos: Uses the NFC reader to scan figurines and unlock game bonuses, the same service was also implemented in the Wii U. SpotPass: The continuation of WiiConnect24, now automatically connects to unsecured Wi-Fi access points. StreetPass: Automatically exchanges data between nearby 3DS systems. Nintendo marketed it as a way of connecting random 3DS players on the street. Play Coins: Unlocks game content by doing some exercise (walking). Operating System Having a large number of CPUs eventually impacts the overall complexity of the operating system. Not only that, but this console also stores more than one OS. This originates as a mechanism for providing large services (i.e. DSi/DS/GBA backwards compatible, rescue mode, etc.). So, to avoid making this section any more confusing, let’s go by steps. Architecture The Nintendo 3DS, as a whole, comes with four firmware [57]: NATIVE_FIRM: Operates the console in ‘native’ mode (with the functionality exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS). Here, the ARM11 executes the main program. Curiously enough, there are two instances of NATIVE_FIRM installed (named FIRM0 and FIRM1, respectively) in case the first one gets corrupted, for some reason. This firmware is often referred to as ‘Horizon’ as well. TWL_FIRM: It commands the Nintendo 3DS to behave like a Nintendo DSi. It does come at the expense of disabling all the exclusive features, but considering how the CPU, GPU, sound and I/O are intertwined; TWL_FIRM is truly a work of art. Consequently, the ARM9 and ARM7 are placed in the foreground (they execute the main program) [58]. The name ‘TWL’ comes from the codename of the Nintendo DSi. AGB_FIRM: Similarly to TWL_FIRM but the 3DS now becomes a Game Boy Advance. Here, the ARM7 executes the main program. SAFE_FIRM: Used solely for maintenance-related tasks, such as system updates. This firmware is basically an early revision of NATIVE_FIRM (doesn’t go beyond version 3.0 on the old 3DS and version 8.1 on the New 3DS [59]). All of these firmware come with separate binaries for the ARM11, ARM9 and ARM7 CPUs. The only exception is that the ARM7 won’t be active under NATIVE_FIRM and SAFE_FIRM. Generally speaking, the Nintendo 3DS will first launch a Boot ROM and then bootstrap NATIVE_FIRM. Afterwards, the running operating system may choose to reboot to another firmware based on the user’s actions (i.e. load a Nintendo DS game or run the firmware update assistant). Let’s take a look now at how each CPU behaves in NATIVE_FIRM mode. The security processor Once NATIVE_FIRM is bootstrapped, the ARM9 runs its own operating system made of a kernel called Kernel9 and a single program called Process9 [60]. Kernel9’s design follows the microkernel model, meaning it only provides essential abstraction with the hardware, including: Memory management. Process scheduling. Inter-Process Communication. On the other side, Process9 is a userland application that implements these services: Communication with the ARM11, called ‘PXI’. Cryptography-related functions. This involves AES, RSA, SHA and ECDSA. I/O management. File System. Title (3DS software) verification and installation. Both Kernel and Process9 reside on an ARM9-only block of 1 MB of SRAM (1.5 MB in the case of the New 3DS). In terms of security, there’s no privilege distinction between Kernel9 and Process9, since the latter has unconditional access to a system call that runs arbitrary code in kernel mode. In summary, combined with the exclusive I/O hardwired into the ARM9, this CPU has the role of a security processor, much like what the Wii and Wii U’s ARM9 also did, and unlike the co-processor architecture of the Nintendo DS, where its second processor just offloaded I/O and audio tasks. The user processor Likewise, the ARM11 runs a kernel of similar architecture to the ARM9 one (now called Kernel11). The big difference is that the ARM11 will be running multiple userland processes, and in doing so they provide services like: Communication with the ARM9, called ‘PXI’. Multi-core processing. Networking, HTTP and SSL. Connection with Nintendo online infrastructure. The graphical shell (called ‘HOME Menu’). The ability to launch applications. A layer of abstraction for apps called Services, which games must call to access hardware resources. Some components like the GPU are interfaced by a very thin API, nonetheless. Furthermore, services are implemented in a layered manner. Games only access a subset of these, and the latter in turn invokes greater privileged and specialised services. The ARM11’s kernel resides on a dedicated block 512 KB of SRAM [61], also called ‘AXI Work RAM’ or ‘AXI WRAM’, because it’s connected to the ARM11 using the AXI protocol. Imposed behaviour Now for the bitter news, NATIVE_FIRM also enforces unusual restrictions on user programs. Overview of the privilege levels in the Nintendo 3DS running NATIVE_FIRM, after combining both operating systems. To start with, the ARM11’s scheduler is hard-coded with specific behaviour for each core (as opposed to treating every core as general-purpose units): The first core, called appcore, is for the game to use. Yet, its thread scheduling policy is FIFO, meaning that the game can deadlock itself if multi-threading is improperly used [62]. The second core, called syscore, gets assigned system-related tasks. Conversely, syscore can lend 30% of its execution time to user applications, which may be helpful to offload some operations, although not every routine may work under syscore (especially time-sensitive ones) [63]. The curtailment is further extended with the New 3DS, whose ARM11 MPCore now comes with four cores, namely: The fourth MP11 is solely used for face-tracking. Instead of adding circuitry, Nintendo engineers implemented face-tracking through pure software. Thus, it reserves one MP11 for this. I’m guessing this was a cost-effective solution for Nintendo. The third MP11 core is permanently idle, as the scheduler is never instructed to dispatch threads there. Game meta-data does include a flag to enable thread scheduling on this core, albeit its usage on any commercial game is yet to be confirmed. It’s highly possible that at one point Nintendo considered it, but ultimately rendered it unfeasible for battery consumption reasons, or maybe because single-core games would suffer some compatibility issue. Considering the New Nintendo 2DS XL is a New Nintendo 3DS without the stereoscopic screen, that means half of its quad-core CPU is wasted! CDMA, the ‘New’ DMA unit, is only accessible during the console’s boot [64]. After the boot process finishes, CDMA is never used again. Moving on, in terms of usable RAM for games, we know that the Nintendo 3DS and New Nintendo 3DS come with 128 MB and 256 MB of FCRAM, respectively. What you need to know now is that the available RAM for apps is only 64 MB and 124 MB [65], respectively. This means that the OS consumes ~50% of the console’s main memory, not a particularly pleasant quality! To alleviate this, games also have the option to set a flag in their metadata (called APPMEMTYPE) to claim more FCRAM from the system, up to 96 MB and 176 MB, respectively. Behind the scenes, that flag instructs the system to reboot the console and boot the game without launching the HOME Menu beforehand, saving memory in the way. All things considered, you can now sense how not all extra hardware in the New 3DS will automatically imply faster software. It’s a shame, and it gives me the feeling that the New 3DS was a rushed product, from the software perspective. But to be fair, Nintendo never planned the ‘New’ 3DS to be a full successor of the original 3DS. The ‘New’ brand was a clear move to refresh the 3DS line, considering the sales number wasn’t satisfying, to say the least. Storage Medium Now that we know how the operating system is designed, let’s look at where and how data is stored in this console. Boot ROMs OTP memory eMMC NAND SD/microSD Following its long ancestor, the Game Boy, the SoC stores a series of unencrypted ROMs containing the programs used for booting up NATIVE_FIRM [66]. These bootstrappers are called Boot9 and Boot11; and are executed by the ARM9 and ARM11, respectively. Likewise, they are physically and virtually kept hidden for security reasons. To give you an example, Boot9 stores AES decryption keys, which are not something to carelessly leave anywhere. Interestingly enough, Boot9’s code has revealed that it’s more capable than just bootstrapping NATIVE_FIRM from eMMC NAND. However, due to certain routines having hardcoded directories and security layers added on top, the only firmware the Boot ROMs can ultimately load is NATIVE_FIRM from eMMC NAND. Moreover, while multiple components have changed with the arrival of the New 3DS, the BootROMs have not changed a bit [67]. Next » Boot process Now that we know how the operating system is structured and where data is stored, let’s see how the Nintendo 3DS goes from a glossy powered-off brick to becoming an operating console offering multiple services. Multi-core chaos Considering the 3DS must be able to manage four processors (2-core ARM11 + ARM9 + ARM7) in its SoC - or six, if you look at the New 3DS - one can only wonder how these ‘central’ processors suddenly become exceptionally coordinated during the console’s startup. Well, it’s all about implementing a master-slave hierarchy. With the ARM9 and ARM7, there’s not a lot of room for doubt, both can be powered on separately and load different binaries. So the challenge is mainly focused on disseminating the homogenous multi-core ARM11. In the ARM11 MPCore cluster, all cores start execution at vector 0x00000000 [71]. However, CP15 (the System Control co-processor) provides a register called CPU ID which, among other things, serves to identify the core currently executing instructions. Thus, programmers can query this register to decide whether the current CPU core should give orders (master) or wait for commands (slave). ARM later improved this technique by supplying a dedicated register called mpidr, found in ARMv7 CPUs. Thanks to this, Nintendo engineers were able to identify any CPU core within the 3DS cluster and implement a bootloader where all cores become coordinated, and then carry out the necessary functions to bring the console to life. Boot procedure Time to dive into the boot process. As with any other console of its generation, security is of great importance, which will have an impact on the boot stage. To avoid making this section too dense, I’ve simplified the stages where the security system is set up, but you’ll find more information in the ‘Anti-piracy’ section. Having said that, once the console is powered on, the following sequence of events takes place [72] [73]: The ARM9 and ARM11 power up. The ARM9’s reset vector is at address 0xFFFF0000, which points to Boot9 [74]. The ARM11 is induced in an infinite reset until its reset pin is lifted. Boot9 clears ARM11’s reset pin and then initialises the ARM9’s MPU. The ARM11 MPCore will now start execution of Boot11 in parallel: ARM11’s reset vector is at address 0x00000000 [75], which happens to be in the same place as Boot11. Boot11 will branch depending on which core is it being executed on. If it’s greater than core 2, it hangs indefinitely. Wait until ARM9 is finished bootstrapping a firmware Meanwhile, the ARM9 will be busy continuig with Boot9 execution: The AES and RSA public keys are exported to the AES and RSA engines (these will be explained in the ‘Anti-piracy’ section). Boot9 will try to boot from NAND. In NAND, there’s a partition at location 0x0 called ‘NCSD header’, this states that there are eight partitions, each with a firmware to boot from. For each firmware partition listed, Boot9 will fetch its header, validate the SHA-256 hash and RSA-2048 signature (using a set of keys previously loaded from BootROM) and repeat this process until one validation succeeds. Then, it will boot from there. If all validations in NAND fail, Boot9 will try to boot from a Flash memory in the Wi-Fi module. If that also fails, the console will display an error screen. The first partition validated happens to contain NATIVE_FIRM. Boot9 will proceed to copy the firmware to different memory areas based on the header’s parameters. Disable half of Boot9 and Boot11. In doing so, FCRAM will be accessible. Redirect ARM9 and ARM11’s execution to the firmware’s entry points. Now that NATIVE_FIRM is bootstrapped: The ARM9 will: Load Kernel9. Kernel9 hides OTP memory and loads Process9. The ARM9 CPU is now up and running Process9. Whilst the ARM11 does the following: Load Kernel11. In the case of the New 3DS, Kernel11 will write to a new register called CFG11_BOOTROM_OVERLAY_CNT to overlay Boot11 code [76]. This will allow to redirect execution of the new ARM11 cores (core 3 and core 4) away from Boot11 to arbitrary functions in Kernel11, thereby taking control of them. Kernel11 will start various system processes, including PM (Process Manager). PM will start the ‘NS’ (Nintendo User Interface Shell) system module. NS will either launch a game or the HOME Menu application. The user is now in control. Alternative boot processes All of the previous explanations have been focused on booting up NATIVE_FIRM, which results in the traditional native 3DS mode. For other firmware such as TWL_FIRM, AGB_FIRM and SAFE_FIRM, it’s a bit more complicated. Turns out the previous boot process is still needed because only NATIVE_FIRM can be booted from a power cycle. But once this is running, it can bootstrap any of those firmware, and each will program the ARM9 differently. In either case, the security set-up during Boot9 will still be enforced. TWL_FIRM and AGB_FIRM, in particular, operate a special set of registers that mould the 3DS hardware and memory layout in accordance with what DS, DSi or GBA games expect to find. FCRAM can still be accessed, allowing to boot a game ROM from those places as well (apart from the NTR card reader). However, FCRAM will be reconfigured to follow the DS and GBA bus specification (16-bit wide, instead of 32-bit). A big difference about the backwards compatible firmware is that, at last, the ARM7 will be active (as Nintendo DSi/DS and GBA software require it). To exit either mode, non-NATIVE firmware contain a routine that reboots the system and consequently returns it to NATIVE_FIRM. Thus, 3DS mode. Interactive shell The 7th generation of console interfaces has landed on the Nintendo 3DS. A clear indication is that users don’t need a retail game to make the most out of their console, just navigate through the shell and you’ll find numerous apps and services bundled. This includes the special offering of this console (3D camera, stereoscopic view and augmented reality). The pressure to compete against smartphones couldn’t be clearer. Home Mii Settings The HOME Menu with some apps installed. On this occasion, I also had the game cartridge of Mario Land inserted. In terms of user interface design, I’m inclined to say there are many patterns borrowed from the Wii System Menu, yet ported to a dual-screen portable system. The HOME Menu (name of the interactive shell) uses a 1-page navigation system where every installed application is shown on a scrollable grid. Except for a few shortcuts here and there, every service is an application to be launched. Now, being a Nintendo product, you can expect a special focus on creativity and attention to detail. Families are the target audience, nevertheless, adults are the ones paying, and Nintendo knows that. Maintaining consistency The NS module is not only responsible for launching the interactive shell, it also offers 3DS software with the ability to invoke routines to handle certain interactions. One example is the ‘Back to HOME Menu’ overlay, which must be shown whenever the user presses the ‘HOME’ button. Users can press the ‘HOME’ button midgame, this will reinstate the HOME Menu without closing the current application. This event is handled by the running application but the routines are provided by the NS service. Furthermore, 3DS software may also invoke ‘mini applications’ for attending other events (i.e. show the virtual keyboard), these are known as Applets [77]. Both sets are a crucial dependency for all applications, as they are responsible for properly reacting to external events consistently. Interestingly enough, since Applets and NS routines are not part of the game itself, in the case of New 3DS systems, even if a game is running in compatibility mode (that is, with all the ‘New’ hardware disabled), they will still be executed using the full extend of hardware, giving a small performance boost to unoptimised 3DS games. The legacy shell Whilst the special firmware includes the old BIOS routines DS/GBA games will expect, there’s no DS or DSi shell in sight. The old Wi-Fi setup screens (invoked by DSi and DS games) are the only exceptions. Interestingly enough, while the original DS Wi-Fi settings are useless (as they can only connect to WEP-protected access points), the DSi counterpart (accessed from DSi and ‘DSi enhanced’ DS games) can alter the 3DS’ Wi-Fi settings. Yet, these games bundle an old Wi-Fi driver that only worked with the real DSi (the 3DS contains an Atheros AR6014 while the DSi came with an Atheros AR6002 or AR6013). So, to tackle this, both Wi-Fi settings are automatically synced when the firmware boots up [78]. Updatability Well, of course, an updatable system is pretty much a requirement, not only for providing new functionality but also from a security perspective. You can update the system software either online or through a game cartridge. Confusingly enough, both contain different update packages. Game cartridges only bundle system updates without the updated user apps, whereas network updates include everything [79]. Consequently, version names encode a mix of the two, in case the user used both channels. To install updates, the NS service reboots into SAFE_FIRM, where the System Updater takes care of this process [80]. Games It’s time to check how game development and distribution were carried out. Additionally, we’ll see some exclusive services Nintendo prepared for this console. Development ecosystem Before the Nintendo 3DS arrived, developing for embedded system involved monumental efforts and high levels of patience. Compared to desktop applications, the tooling wasn’t standardised and sometimes it didn’t converge well with each other (ActiveSync is the clearest example I remember). The range of documentation didn’t usually go beyond what the manufacturer provided, the same applied for technical support. Enter the 2010s decade, coinciding with the influx of an ARM-based smartphone industry and more efficient compilers, development for those platforms was no longer a complicated endeavour. Consequently, game studios developing for the Nintendo 3DS were able to enjoy this evolution. Now, Nintendo was not providing a standard toolchain yet, but they were on the right track (finally reached with the Nintendo Switch). Curiously enough (and this is an interesting contrast), back in 2011, Apple offered Clang/LLVM 1.3 and OpenGL ES 3.0 for developing iOS apps, this was considered state-of-the-art for mobile projects. Well, you’ll see throughout this section that this wasn’t the case for Nintendo. Yet, at present, if you grab an old iPhone 4s and try to install any app on the App Store (its only official medium), it will tell you your system is too old. Whereas you can still play any retail game on your 3DS. Food for thought. Hardware Kits Software Kits Nintendo partnered with two suppliers to produce development kits [81]. The first supplier was the well-known Intelligent Systems and the other was Kyoto MicroComputers. Among the many options, studios could rent a general-purpose ‘CTR-BOX’. This is a metallic box housing the 3DS hardware, and connected to it is a ‘dummy’ 3DS case that serves as a controller and display. With it, developers could deploy, test and debug their code. For more single-purpose tools, studios could get official flashcards to distribute game prototypes to external testers. These flashcards still only run on non-retail equipment, though this included cheaper options (with reduced functionality) than the fully-fledged CTR-BOX. With the arrival of the New 3DS, IS and Partner offered the ‘SNAKE’ kits with updated hardware. Next » Medium The Nintendo 3DS can run software from three different mediums. Gamecards eShop/SD Card Local wireless Example of a retail game. Notice the creative touch with Luigi holding onto the 3DS banner. This is the distribution channel for retail software. Internally called ‘CTR cards’, they’re just another proprietary card/cartridge designed by Nintendo. To be fair, they’re not very different from NTR Cards (used by the Nintendo DS), aside from a cosmetic notch at the top right. Inside them, there is read-only and/or writable storage. The variants of CTR cards range drastically. Their PCB can bundle a ROM chip ranging from 128 MB to 4 GB in size, while also including some ‘backup memory’ to store saves, this can be either 128 KB or 512 KB. In other variants, the whole CTR storage is instead filled with Flash (up to 2 GB), and it’s partitioned to store both the game and saves in the same physical chip. Moreover, since games will be bundling the official SDK as well, the usable capacity of ROM/RAM allowed to the game depends on the revision of the SDK linked to. Internally, the ROM chip is connected to an 8-bit data bus [84], while the backup memory relies on a serial bus. Both are connected to a 16.6 MHz clock. When the card is inserted into the console, the 3DS first queries it using NTR (Nintendo DS) commands [85], and then switches to ‘CTR mode’ once it detects it’s a 3DS card. Next » Virtual console(s) If, after all explained, users still got bored, Nintendo prepared another offering for them: Virtual Console. Virtual console catalogue for Game Boy Color games. Example of Game Boy Color game running on the Nintendo 3DS. By default, the game is scaled to full-screen (keeping the original aspect ratio). However, by holding ‘Start’ or ‘Select’, you get a 1:1 scale with a nice-looking frame. Once again, thanks to the bundled eShop app, Nintendo also expanded its 3DS-only catalogue by incorporating games originally published for the following consoles: Nintendo DSi (DSiWare only). NES/Famicom. Sega Game Gear. Game Boy. Game Boy Color. Virtual Console games behave as any other application installed into the console. Except for DSiWare software, the application package includes a ROM and emulator. The latter implements interesting capabilities, such as Download Play (for some games) and save states. Virtual console catalogue for Super Nintendo games (only for New 3DS users). Example of an SNES game running on the Nintendo 3DS (the display looks dim because the game is paused). Notice how the options menu allows you to switch between 4:3 and 8:7 aspect ratios. Once again, things were different for New 3DS users, as they could also access the Super Nintendo catalogue. This particularly strikes me as odd, as I remember a time when (homebrew) SNES emulators were developed for the original Nintendo DS (with its mere ARM9-ARM7 and a couple of megs of RAM). Extra backwards compatibility Now, here’s another peculiarity of Virtual console games: this console can also play Game Boy Advance games, officially. Yet, they’re not available for everyone. Only those who purchased a Nintendo 3DS before August 2011 (right before the console received an $80 price cut), became members of the ‘Ambassador Program’ [88]. One of the perks included access to a selection of GBA games which, for one reason or another, were kept exclusive until date. Example of GBA game showing on the HOME Menu. GBA game running without emulation on the Nintendo 3DS (there’s no screenshot functionality on AGB_FIRM). Even more puzzling, GBA titles don’t run on the ARM11 using an emulator (albeit there’s one installed, but never been used!). Instead, they kickstart the third firmware, AGB_FIRM, to run natively on top of the ARM7. What makes it puzzling, is that these GBA games, only offered through the Ambassador Program, remained the only purpose of AGB_FIRM, as if Nintendo planned for something bigger in the future, but never materialised. This is another example of how the Nintendo 3DS possessed more hardware than the software ever took advantage of. If you’re curious, GBA titles make use of the bundled ARM7 core instead. Thus, they don’t allow for the extra features that emulators (running on ARM11 cores) provide. Although, this happens at the exchange of running at full speed and precision. Be as it may, since the 3DS doesn’t contain a GBA cartridge slot, the GBA game is instead copied into FCRAM before the system reboots into AGB_FIRM, and then lets the ARM7 take control (while the ARM11 and ARM9 provide basic support tasks) [89]. With all these capabilities, and on top of being a portable console, one can’t help but wonder why Nintendo didn’t distribute GBA and Nintendo DS/DSi games on the eShop as well. Most probably a marketing and licensing issue, I sense. Game updates Another requirement of the 8th generation of consoles, games can now receive patches after the shipping date. That’s right, no more need to quality control the game before selling it! Leaving irony aside, game updates are distributed through the eShop as well [90], which applies to all types of games (except Download Play). All updates are downloaded onto the SD card and eShop games get their updates applied altogether (along with the game itself). Network service Out with the old (Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection), in with the new (Nintendo Network)! The same service offered with the Wii U is also implemented on the Nintendo 3DS, and they’re admirably unified, so I recommend checking the Wii U article where it’s been explained in detail. Anti-Piracy and Homebrew The history of hacking this console is a long and interesting sequence of events. At first, interests focused on cracking game card readers (in an attempt to replicate the success of the Nintendo DS) and then shifted towards more sophisticated approaches, only involving the operating system. Main targets First things first, let’s start by describing the two main targets of this system: The Game/CTR card reader: This is where physical games are loaded. Historically, the Nintendo DS implemented a weak security mechanism that was eventually cracked and subsequently led to an influx of Flashcards. The Operating System: This area is responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of every single program before execution (aside from the Boot ROM). Disabling said mechanisms would grant the execution of Homebrew (unauthorised applications) without any restrictions, in theory. They may look like two independent fronts (similar to the Xbox 360 and Wii U), but in the case of this console, both are intertwined. You’ll see it in a bit. The card reader front The card reader is the interface between the CPUs and the Gamecards’ memory chip. Its only job is to simplify the communication with the use of commands. Inside the ROM/Flash of CTR Carts, the system will find a block of data in a secured format called NCSD, this will be handled by the operating system, who will be in charge of authenticating, validating and decrypting it. In conclusion, it seems the OS is solely responsible for the communication with the card reader, so let’s move on to the next front. The Operating System front Before we continue, if you’re not familiar with symmetric and asymmetric encryption systems, I recommend reading previous articles of this series. They will also explain why systems like this rely so much on asymmetric encryption systems (such as RSA and ECDSA). Dedicated hardware Chain of trust Operating system functions You’d be right if you suspected that the ARM11 lacks the powerhouse to protect the whole system. Nintendo knew that too, so they took extra care and bundled extra components to compensate: The ARM11 cores implement the XN flag and the ARM9 bundles a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), meaning the CPUs won’t execute code from any location in memory just because the current program tells it to. As said before, the ARM9 acts as a dedicated processor to handle all security-related tasks while the ARM11 MPCore executes the game. Additionally, the ARM9 is exclusively wired to a few hidden cryptographic accelerators: An AES engine that performs AES-128 encryption/decryption without consuming (and exposing) CPU resources. This was inherited from the Nintendo DSi, but can now store up to 64 keys and can operate in numerous block cipher modes, including CTR, CCM, CBC and ECB [91]. Each key slot also features its own key-scrambler, meaning that two arbitrary keys can be used to generate the final AES key. Moreover, the key-scrambler won’t allow anyone to read the generated key, only to treat it as a blackbox to encrypt/decrypt data. An RSA engine. By contrast, this performs RSA encryption/decryption using a given RSA public key. This time, it only contains four key slots and there’s no key-scrambler [92]. However, it’s still a write-only space, meaning no one will be able to read the keys stored there. You’ll soon see that this system is filled with RSA-2048 and RSA-4096 signatures, which explains why this component is as crucial as the AES engine. A Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG): These are registers that return a different value every time they’re read from. OTP (one-time programmable) memory that stores console-unique keys, information about the console and CTCert (an ECDSA private key to authenticate with Nintendo’s servers). To complicate things further, these keys will be encrypted with an AES-CBC key found in Boot9. Finally, this region includes a flag to disable its access once it’s not needed anymore. Last but not least, the eMMC memory contains a register called CID (Card Identification) and stores unique information about the eMMC’s manufacturing, which will be fed to the AES’ key-scrambler for further obfuscation. To top it off, everything is sealed in an SoC, including the two boot ROMs (Boot9 and Boot11). These are unencrypted, but since they’re inaccessible, they don’t represent a concern. Next » Flaws Even though the Nintendo 3DS enjoyed modern protection techniques, such as asymmetric cryptography and lots of hardware at its disposal, there were some fundamental flaws in its implementation. Take a look at the following findings discovered by the hacking community: While the XN flag in the ARM11 works without problems, Kernel11 sets up the page table in AXI WRAM (where Kernel11 resides) in a way that it grants Read, Write and Execute permissions to the whole memory block [98], rendering the capabilities of XN a bit useless (at least for protecting Kernel11). Before system version 3.0.0, OTP memory was never hidden [99], meaning that with the help of any exploit, the OTP keys could be extracted without problem. There’s no separation between Process9 and Kernel9, as Kernel9 provides a system call that allows Process9 to perform any function with Kernel9 privileges [100]. There’s no ASLR (Address space layout randomization) implemented [101], enabling Return-oriented programming (ROP) for exploitation purposes. Similarly, there’s no protection against system downgrading. Once again, this system also comes with a Web browser based on Webkit, which is under constant attack (especially if the fork is old). This will not only pave the way to the first exploitation attempts, but will also act as a constraint for Nintendo when they try to patch their system. Defeat The history of the Nintendo 3DS and Homebrew is a successful one. Tons of video tutorials can attest to that. Yet, the passage exposes very clever discoveries, which evolved from initially requiring proprietary and expensive equipment to just a couple of clicks on your computer. The DS flashcard era (2011-2013) Where to begin? Well, from where the Nintendo DSi left it off: Flashcards. After the release of the Nintendo DSi in 2008, Nintendo incorporated a new element to fight against Flashcards: A whitelist file listing every single licensed card and thereby blocking the ‘unauthorised ones’ [102]. By no means Flashcard manufacturers ceased their production, they just shipped new variants of their old Flashcards that allowed the user to re-program the cartridge header, enabling the card to identify as a different authorised game whilst Nintendo kept amending the list (through software updates). This method encompassed the Nintendo 3DS as well, following the same process as the Nintendo DSi. On no account they would get access to the exclusive 3DS hardware, yet this is how Homebrew started in this console. The 3DS flashcard era (2013-2016) There was much progress during the first two years of this console (a big achievement for Nintendo!). Yet, things took a turn in August 2013… The first real 3DS Flashcard Inside the Gateway3DS Subsequent anecdotes The Gateway3DS package [103]. Ignoring teasers of ‘3DS Flascards’ that never appeared [104]. Gateway3DS can be considered the first 3DS Flashcard to reach the stores. The instructions were not as simple as DS Flashcards, however. You can sense this by looking at the contents of the box: A whitelisted DS Flashcard (known as Blue Gateway) whose only purpose is to run a Nintendo DS ROM crafted by Gateway. As part of the ‘installation’ process, users were first required to run this ‘game’ and follow the instructions. A Launcher.dat to be placed in the 3DS’ SD card. A 3DS Flashcard (known as Red Gateway) where the 3DS game is loaded from. Like any other Flashcard, it also features a microSD slot where the 3DS game is stored. The big difference, however, is that the 3DS game image is flashed into the microSD card, meaning that only one 3DS game can be stored at a time. This makes sense, as RSA signatures can’t be faked (at least, that’s computationally unfeasible). Yet, replicating an exact clone of the game (NCSD block) worked. Forget about Homebrew, for now. After completing the installation process, users would have to follow these instructions to run any game: Insert the Red Gateway card. Nothing will appear, yet. Open the 3DS settings app and navigate to the DS profile editor screen. For some reason, the 3DS will restart and the flashed 3DS game will show up. After finishing playing a game, returning to the HOME Menu will create a savefile in the 3DS’ SD card. And just like that, users were now able to download 3DS ROMs from the net and run them on their consoles… but how was all of this possible? How did anyone manage to extract decrypted games? What exploits did Gateway3DS employ (or even discover)? Truth is, there’s a lot of hidden functionality within this product. Let’s analyse it step by step. Next » Nintendo acts fast Having an updatable system software meant Nintendo didn’t have to stand there and watch how its system got cracked: In March 2013, system update 5.0.0-11 updated the settings app, provisionally fixing the MSET exploit [111]. If you check the timeline, this was before Gateway3DS shipped their card! Hence, it was a prerequisite for users to stay on older versions. It won’t be until 2015 when the Gateway team released a notable firmware update. From then on, the flashcard relied on a new Web Browser exploit (called spider exploit, discovered by MathewE) as the entry point. This method lasted until the end of Gateway3DS’ lifespan. In December 2013, system update 7.0.0-13 fixed the kernel exploits used in combination with MSET and, most importantly, added the RSA module into the chain of trust to decrypt NCCH blocks (where the game data is found) [112]. RSA keys are cleared once Kernel9 finishes loading, meaning existing exploits won’t be able to decrypt games that adopted the new 7.0.0 encryption system (unless a vulnerability is used before Kernel9 boots). As Gateway3DS’ Launcher.dat file contained copyrighted code by Nintendo, the latter company sent Cease & Desist letters to many forums, including GBATemp, which in turn blocked the distribution of those files. As always, this marked the start of another cat-and-mouse game. Though, to make a long story short, system update 9.3.0 (released in December 2014) finally put an end to Gateway3DS by patching their private Kernel exploit [113]. Since then, Gateway3DS’ firmware updates only improved emuNAND support with the latest system versions (for those who didn’t update past the breaking update). In 2016, Gateway’s last update was released. Meanwhile, Sky3DS enjoyed support until system software 11.0 (released in May 2016) [114], when Nintendo blacklisted it for good. I think now it’s fair to say that the 3DS flashcard market ended up being too turbulent and unreliable for the average user, compare this to the ‘plug & play’ experience Nintendo DS flashcard offered. Finally some good news for Nintendo, so far. The dawn of homebrew (2014) 2014 saw an emergence of homebrew-focused solutions in a circle populated by piracy-oriented developments [115]. Hacking a 3DS still required an old system version, a Gateway3DS card and emuNAND - but that would slowly shift once alternative tools gained traction. Plutoo, Derrek and Smealum presenting their findings at the 32nd Chaos Communication Congress (2015) [116], the following paragraphs will explain most of them. Open-source SDKs Ninjhax chain Gaining Kernel11 access Initial Homebrew appeared in the form of Laucher.dat files, these were produced with the help of devkitARM (a general-purpose toolchain for ARM-based CPUs) and a set of scripts. Fierce Waffle provided ‘ROP Loader’, a toolkit that included a DS program to install the MSET exploit; and a Launcher.dat that triggered a Kernel11 exploit. It’s worth pointing out that there wasn’t any tool available, yet, that helped access the 3DS’ exclusive hardware. At the start of 2014, Smealum, with the collaboration of yellows8, ichfly, WinterMute, fincs, mtheall and plutoo, released ctrulib, an open-source C library to facilitate Homebrew development [117]. This is now known as libctru and maintained by the devkitPro group, who have incorporated it into their toolchain. A year later, neobrain released nihstro [118], a PICA200 shader assembler a disassembler, making the job of programming the PICA200 a bit more enjoyable. To run Homebrew, users had the option to flash a homebrew binary into a microSD, and then use the Gateway3DS to boot it (as their CFW already disabled signature checks) [119]. Next » Most-wanted tools Considering the availability of Gateway3DS’ emuNAND, Ninjhax, CTRLib and the new Kernel exploits, the flood of new software was too great to ignore. To mention a few: CtrBootManager by cpasjuste: An extra stage in HomeMenuHax’s chain that acts as a boot manager, enabling the selection of various payloads [123]. Shortly after, a new implementation with extended functionality emerged: BootCtr by m45t3r [124]. RxTools by Roxas75: A Swiss knife for Gateway3DS users [125]. This was offered as a replacement for Gateway3DS’ binaries. Among many things, it includes a CFW called RXMode. This alternative and open-source solution disables signature checks on 3DS binaries, provides emuNAND and removes TWL_FIRM’s whitelist checks, to mention a few. Other CFWs will soon make their appearance, like CakesFW, ReiNand and Pasta CFW [126]. These serve different purposes and include their own set of modifications. Custom HomeMenu Manager (CHMM) by Rinnegatamante: Allows to install HOME Menu themes from the SD card [127]. AGB_FIRM Signature patcher by Riku. Loads arbitrary Game Boy Advance ROMs into AGB_FIRM [128], finally expanding the abandoned catalogue of Nintendo Ambassador games. Ftpbrony by mtheall (later known as ftpd): A simple FTP server [129]. DevMenu: Not exactly a homebrew app, but a stolen Nintendo-authored app from development units, enabling users to install app packages (in the form of ‘CIA’ files) into the system, just like the eShop did behind the scenes. Months later, BigBlueMenu was used instead, which also came from Nintendo’s development kit. It wasn’t until a real open-source solution was brought forward some months after. FBI by Steveice10 became the standard dilemma-free tool for installing CIA files (notice the pun in the names) [130]. New console, permanent mods (2015) While homebrew developers were busy fiddling with their system, Nintendo released a new product to the surprise of everyone: The New 3DS. Apart from the extra hardware (already mentioned throughout this article), a new stage was added to the boot process: arm9loader. With this, Nintendo enhanced their chain of trust by adding new keys, which must be decrypted with the help of a hash of OTP memory (therefore, using console-unique values) [131]. However, arm9loader and the new keys are still stored in NAND, meaning that the contents may be overwritten. This led to one of the most disrupting vulnerabilities of 2015, involving Plutoo, Yellows8 and Delebile. arm9loaderhax The first implementation of arm9loader was flawed: the decryption key for the ARM9 system was never removed from the AES engine. So, with the help of additional exploitation, one could reconstruct part of the encryption keys [132]. Consequently, Nintendo quickly tried again with arm9loader v1.1 (found on system update 9.6.0). As luck would have it, this led to a more powerful exploit: Plutoo discovered that the key used to decrypt the ARM9 system was never verified. Hence, arm9Loader will boot NATIVE_FIRM even if the decrypted data is wrong (a.k.a. garbage). Plus, if Firm0 (the first copy of NATIVE_FIRM) fails to boot, Boot9 will try to load Firm1 while the remains of Firm0 stay in the ARM9’s RAM. All in all, if: NAND is modified (somehow) so the encrypted Firm0 contains extra crafted code at the end. The ARM9 OS key is mangled in a way that the decrypted Firm1 will contain a jump instruction to Firm0’s crafted code. … you got yourself arm9loaderhax, a permanent exploit that provides arbitrary code execution with Kernel9 privileges at boot time! Since Kernel9 access was now possible, albeit through difficult means, work was put into simplifying the process (i.e. developing an automated installer). The effects of arm9loaderhax New discoveries meant new developments. Over the following months, more advanced tools will become part of the ‘must have’ list of every homebrew user. To start with, a new CFW to-rule-them-all shipped: Luma3DS [133]. Among many features, Luma3DS provides: The removal of signature and region checks. A layered filesystem to redirect file operations to the SD card (enabling game modifications). Rosalina Menu, an in-game menu overlay where many utilities can be accessed without closing any application. Initially, Luma3DS was bootstrapped with BootCtr, but that changed once arm9loaderhax became the de-facto hack for any 3DS. Thus, the arm9loaderhax + Luma3DS combination became part of any hacking tutorial. Along it, other software appeared: Godmode9 by d0k3: A next-generation Swiss knife that takes advantage of the permissions granted by ARM9 exploits [134], enabling the user to read and modify every corner of the console. It can be loaded by arm9loaderhax, Luma3DS or any other compatible hack. Now, the more powerful the exploit, the more functionality is provided. Examples of functionality include a file browser and NAND backup. Plus it’s further extended with scripts. Anemone3DS by astronautlevel: With a multitude of features, it soon became the app for managing HOME Menu themes [135]. nds-bootstrap by Rocket Robz: As the name indicates, it loads Nintendo DS software (ROMs and homebrew) from the SD card [136]. While it’s designed to support the three portable consoles (the Nintendo 3DS, DSi and DS, the latter requiring a flashcard), loading it from the 3DS will kickstart TWL_FIRM, meaning there’s no emulation at all. It’s most commonly used through ‘TWLMenu’ (now ‘TWiLight Menu++’), the front-end of nds-bootstrap. It’s worth mentioning that, at the time of this writing, these are the most popular utilities to install on a hacked 3DS. The Golden Age (2016-2017) While a universal and powerful solution, installing arm9loaderhax was still considered a complicated and dangerous activity. Not only does this require dumping the console’s OTP memory beforehand (using other exploits), but neglecting any step could potentially turn a working Nintendo 3DS into a rock. But fear not as new developments were in the works (a mighty effort considering Nintendo was still battling to protect their console). naehrwert, nedwill and derrek presenting a new set of findings at the 33nd Chaos Communication Congress (December 2016) [137]. At the 33C3 conference, derrek unveiled two major discoveries [138], which led to subsequent milestones. Extracting Boot9 Sighax Boot9strap Ntrboot For some reason, the contents of ARM9’s RAM are not cleared upon reset. Thus, Derrek discovered that, with the use of external hardware, he could override the exception vectors from ARM9’s RAM (previously copied from Boot9) with arbitrary code. Then, reset the system, glitch it at very precise timing (also using external hardware) to trigger an exception and hope for the ARM9 to have executed the new code. This will have included something like ‘Copy all contents of Boot9 to X location in RAM’. Lo and behold, this did work. With this, Derrek and others managed to analyse the contents of the Boot9 ROM, allowing new vulnerabilities to be found. Next » The remaining years (2018-present) Now that the homebrew community has achieved its magnum opus, the remaining years of the Nintendo 3DS will only see the streamlining of hacking methods, all of which share the same objective: Install boot9strap. As the methodologies used to hack a 3DS drastically evolve, sometimes too quickly for new users, community-maintained websites like 3ds.hacks.guide currently holds a reputation as the most reliable and updated set of tutorials. By this point in time, there were many exploits in the wild: ‘SoundHax’, ‘Safehax’, ‘Browserhax’… too many to mention here. For the curious, 3DBrew provides a comprehensive list [143]. To give you an idea of how elegant exploitation became by 2023, let me show you a common method users relied on and didn’t require extra hardware. This process was called ‘seedminer + BannerBomb3’ and combined the following vulnerabilities, the majority of them authored by zoogie: seedminer: User data installed in the 3DS’ SD card is encrypted using AES-128-CTR. Its key is constructed from other keys found in a file called movable.sed (console-unique, stored in NAND). Well, it was discovered that this file can be re-constructed by using the console’s Friend Code, subdirectory names in the SD card (generated by the console) and short-term brute-forcing. Once extracted, the keys allowed to tamper with DSiWare data in the SD card. BannerBomb3: An exploit that overflows the stack of the Settings app while it tries to parse the banner of an installed DSiWare title [144]. Combined with seedminer, this serves as an entry-level exploit with Kernel11 privileges. Now, how to take advantage of BannerBomb3 (i.e. which payload to use) depended on the tutorial the user was following at the time. For simplicity purposes, there were two routes: The Safe Mode route The HOME Menu route This route consisted of exploiting SAFE_FIRM and was described in earlier tutorials: unSAFE_MODE: Users can boot into Safe Mode by pressing a combination of buttons during the console’s boot, the alternative firmware then enables the user to perform a system update, which is useful for repairing the console. Well, zoogie discovered that the proxy settings can be overflowed [145]. Hence, providing user-land execution within Safe Mode. safehax: a port of ‘firmlaunch-hax’ to work under SAFE_FIRM. Nintendo originally patched it with system update 9.5.0 released in February 2015 [146]. Yet, SAFE_FIRM is an immutable replica of the factory firmware, and thus it features old exploits NATIVE_FIRM once enjoyed. firmlaunch-hax: When the firmware is booting, the ARM9 stores the firmware’s header in FCRAM for verifying and then parsing. With the help of a race condition, execution can take control of the ARM9, so the boot9strap installer can be launched. Nintendo fixed this by keeping the header in ARM9 RAM instead, although this stayed unpatched on SAFE_FIRM. Next » Post-2023 and conclusions Be as it may, at the time of this writing, Nintendo hasn’t quite surrendered to the cat-and-mouse game. In May 2023, system update 11.17.0 patched BannerBomb3, nullifying one of the last entry points that didn’t require additional materials [151]. This means users will now need to either obtain a legitimate 3DS game (which can then be exploited), an ntrboot-compatible DS flashcard; or wait for a WebKit exploit (there’s one only left for the New 3DS browser [152]). That’s all folks My Nintendo 3DS(s). Apart from the XL one on the left, I bought two extra for this article: The red one you see on the right (originally listed as ‘broken’, turned out the power socket is just flaky) and another one (correctly listed ‘for parts’) to take the motherboard photos. Phew, that was another one of those long articles. I’m glad you managed to keep up and reach the end! If you are curious, this article took me almost a year to finish, mainly due to a combination of multiple factors, but the important thing is that I ultimately managed to complete it. Looking back, it’s hard to admit this console didn’t enjoy the same degree of success as the Nintendo DS. Considering all of its offerings analysed here, I think many external factors hindered its marketing. For starters, the timing was unfortunate and the price tag wasn’t exactly tempting. From my perspective, back when it launched in 2011, the ‘08 financial crisis was hitting hard (I was living in Spain back then), so the Nintendo 3DS wasn’t exactly on adults’ (and kids’) priorities. I eventually got mine in 2018, by then living in the UK. In any case, I want to thank the #ReSwitched and #Godmode9 for spotting lots of mistakes in my initial drafts. This has been the most intricate console I’ve written about (to this date!), nevertheless, I’m very grateful to find communities willing to help out. Until next time!

The program gave a bunch of free games, some not on the eShop, as an apology for the extra $70 or so cost when they sharply dropped the cost of the console not long after release.I was happy with it.Mario Kart Super Circuit was a part of my childhood growing up, and I played that one not too rarely. Using the already-amazing swivel-joystick with it was a dream.Knowing it was actually running on a real-life GBA CPU, like the old one I used to have and played games on all the time growing up, somehow makes it even more special of a memory.Wow. Thank you for writing this article, Rodrigo. Much love.What is mind-boggling to me is that it includes an actual, physical, hardware Gameboy Advance CPU in it for when it&#x27;s playing Gameboy Advanced gamesSony did similar things.The playstation 2 needed a IO chip so Sony picked the PS1 CPU. Then pass execution to it when playing a PS1 game.And if I remember correctly, in the first revisions of the playstation 3 they included a ps2 CPU and GPU. I don&#x27;t think they served a purpose when not running ps2 games though. They later remove them in favour of emulation to presumable save costs. reply deelowe 4 hours agorootparentThe wii has GameCube hardware and the Wiiu is basically just a faster wii. reply Philip-J-Fry 28 minutes agorootparentThe Wii U isn&#x27;t just a faster Wii. It specifically contains 2 GPUs, the Wii U GPU and the Wii GPU. CPU is bigger and better but same architecture.The Wii however was almost just a faster GameCube. CPU literally just clocked higher and a bit of a better GPU. Because the idea was for it to be super cheap to produce. reply einr 4 hours agorootparentprevThe Wii is a faster Gamecube. From memory, the CPU runs at 700-something MHz instead of 485 (?) and the graphics are faster too. reply phatfish 1 hour agorootparentThe Wii extended the life of Gamecube games nicely, with a Wii component cable (which are still available cheaply) you get good quality output on modern TVs. It also has the Gamecube controller ports, so your original controllers work.The Wii can emulate N64 games as well, a few made it to the Virtual Console, and there are 3rd party emulators you can install via the Homebrew channel. The GC controller is not bad for playing N64 games.It&#x27;s such a small console that i still have it hooked up under under my TV next to the Switch. reply AndrewDavis 9 minutes agorootparent> It&#x27;s such a small console that i still have it hooked up under under my TV next to the Switch.Same here kinda. I&#x27;ve done similar with a WiiU. The WiiU is backwards compatible with the Wii, it literally boots into Wii firmware! Meaning with a little homebrew it can be modified to load Gamecube games and run them without the need for emulation. Nintendont even supports a variety of controllers to play gamecube games including the WiiU gamecube controller adapter.I dump my Wii and gamecube games on my actual Wii and can load them up in the virtual Wii on the and WiiU.S3 generations running (borderline) natively on the one console. replyDCKing 2 hours agoparentprev> What is mind-boggling to me is that it includes an actual, physical, hardware Gameboy Advance CPU in it for when it&#x27;s playing Gameboy Advanced games.The reasoning why as pointed out by the article makes it even more mind-boggling to me. It includes the GBA CPU almost by accident, because Nintendo took a Matroshka doll approach to backwards compatibility.The Nintendo 3DS contains the entire system architecture of the Nintendo DSi for backwards compatibility (the DSi CPU also functions as a supervisor CPU of the system), which is mostly an overclocked variety of the original Nintendo DS architecture. The first two Nintendo DS models contained a GBA slot for backwards compatibility and therefore also contain the GBA&#x27;s original ARM7TDMI. The Nintendo DS also used this as an auxiliary processor for various things. The reason the GBA hardware is there is because Nintendo kept shipping their previous gen hardware in the new generation twice over.As part of the that Ambassador Program you mention, Nintendo released a boot firmware for the 3DS called \"AGB_FIRM\" to boot into Game Boy Advance mode (another being \"TWL_FIRM\" to boot into Nintendo DS mode). If you hack your 3DS today it can be made to load other Game Boy Advance software and essentially achieves perfect backwards compatibility and runs GBA games with perfect accuracy, modulo any GBA peripherals that were popular. reply rollcat 9 minutes agorootparentI wonder how far down exactly the 3DS matrioshka goes. GBA also had a full GB on board, but not only for backwards compat: it actually served as a sound co-processor for contemporary GBA games. reply Sakos 29 minutes agorootparentprevThis wasn&#x27;t that unusual though? The PS2 contains the PS1&#x27;s CPU and uses it for I&#x2F;O when it isn&#x27;t being used for backwards compatibility with PS1 games. The PS3 contained the CPU&#x2F;GPU of the PS2 in early versions for PS2 BC (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psdevwiki.com&#x2F;ps3&#x2F;PS2_Compatibility). It&#x27;s only with later PS3 iterations that the PS2 hardware was removed in favour of software emulation for BC. reply ungawatkt 6 hours agoparentprev> includes an actual, physical, hardware Gameboy Advance CPUThat&#x27;s an old trick (though no less cool). The GBA had a GBC cpu in it for backwards compatibility, and it used a physical switch to change modes, toggled by the cartridge itself. And iirc the PS2 reused the PS1 cpu as a component on the board for I&#x2F;O, so it was available for backwards compatibility as well (though with emulation help for other components). reply Dwedit 5 hours agorootparentGBA switching to GBC mode turns out to be combination of both hardware and software. There&#x27;s a physical button that is read by the BIOS to see if it wants to perform a mode switch to GBC mode, then the BIOS triggers the mode change.But that button is also responsible for making the cartridge bus actually function with GB&#x2F;GBC cartridges. If you switch into GBC mode without the button being pressed, nothing can be read from the cartridge. (Normally the register bit that switches to GBC mode is locked out and only the BIOS can write it, but if you are executing code in the BIOS, a timed DMA transfer can perform that write.) reply deergomoo 1 hour agorootparentprev> And iirc the PS2 reused the PS1 cpu as a component on the board for I&#x2F;OWhich has some interesting implications for softmodded systems. I play my PS2 games via Ethernet off a Raspberry Pi Samba server—it’s incredible to me that it’s possible and works so well, but because it’s using the PS1 CPU for I&#x2F;O you can’t use it for PS1 games. reply fgsfds028374 5 hours agorootparentprevDitto the Genesis, which used a Z80 for audio and Master System backwards compat reply Dwedit 6 hours agoparentprevThe GBA CPU is part of the NDS CPU, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s in there. reply Pikamander2 2 hours agoparentprevFun fact: Walmart started selling them for the reduced price several days before the official price drop and end of the Ambassador Program&#x27;s claim period.Thanks to a post about it on reddit, I was able to get the reduced price and the free games.

Now like all hobbies, when something gets scarce and I lust and hoard the object, I need to liquidate since you can&#x27;t play 3 consoles at the same time. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agoparentIf you can do something to prevent the battery from going bad (or find a source for replacement batteries in the future), I&#x27;d just hold onto them tbh.I bought a (deep breath) New Nintendo 2DS XL a while ago; it&#x27;s the last iteration of the DS line of games, plays all DS, DSi and 3DS games (and there were only a handful of games released specifically for the \"new\" DS) so that&#x27;s ~15 years of gaming history it supports. I try to pick up DS games where I find them, although finding good deals on them is already difficult - some titles like Bravely Default or whatnot still go for 60 euros around here.There&#x27;s a LOT of shovelware for the DS as well though, I&#x27;m skipping those. reply spiznnx 6 hours agoparentprevWhile you have 3 consoles you should play Tri Force Heros with a couple of friends! reply ThatPlayer 6 hours agorootparentGet a fourth and do Four Swords! reply corysama 9 hours agoprevThis is part of an excellent series https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copetti.org&#x2F;writings&#x2F;consoles&#x2F; reply haunter 5 hours agoprevOne of my favorite feature of the jailbroken 3DS is the NSUI app [0]. The official Virtual Console releases made it possible to play certain old Nintendo games on the 3DS. But turns out the same wrapper (it’a not an emulator so much better performance and compability is straight given) can be used for _any_ game as long as the system is supported.

Afaik the whole console scans the whole storage block level so after a certain point (64GB and above) it becomes plainfully slow.

My intention was originally to try to make homebrew for the consoles. In the end I didn&#x27;t get around to the homebrew stuff but I did play quite a few different games. Thanks in part due to the fact that in a nearby city someone had listed a bunch of DS and a few 3DS cartridges that they were straight up giving away. So with those along with the ones that I got with the consoles, I had like 15 to 20 different games for the consoles or thereabouts.The majority of the play time for me was with the New 3DS XL, as it fit my hands and vision better than the small DS consoles.There were several games that I enjoyed quite a lot.And to me, I still think mobile phones don&#x27;t quite live up to it for a few reasons.I mean, yeah playing GTA III on the iPhone 14 Pro is a nice experience. I&#x27;ve completed GTA III start to finish both on iPhone 14 Pro, as well as on previous iPhone models in the past.But in general I don&#x27;t like playing games with touch screen controls as much as playing with physical buttons. And even though there exists bluetooth controllers you can pair with an iPhone, I had a terrible unusable experience with a tried that.There are some other mobile games that are super nice, like for example Monument Valley.But there is also a lot of ad-ridden garbage on mobile.So my preference would for the most part still be to play more games on the New 3DS XL, rather than to play more games on mobile.But ideally I want to buy something like one of these, and play emulated games:- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anbernic.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rg353v-rg353vs?variant=4335654...- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpd.hk&#x2F;gpdwin4- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.ayaneo.com&#x2F;goods&#x2F;7849577742581But I am still a bit undecided on which one of these to actually buy.All I know is that I want something that1.

I use the OEM Series S controller paired to the iPad.Connected to my headless Xbox Series S are only the CAT6 and AC cables.I think my mesh network is only Wifi 5, too. But it&#x27;s also playable over 5G when I&#x27;m out, and that says a lot because my home connection is run-of-the-mill rural DOCSIS cable internet.Sorry that you had a bad experience. Also I am a huge fan of dedicated appliances for particular classes of applications if you could not tell.Sure, the same iPad Air 5 I&#x27;m using has the fancy M1 that can supposedly play games but...where are the games?Like you said, they&#x27;re not porting the games to iOS because touchscreen. Otoh, they could (and do!) require you need a controller, but then Apple would have to admit you need a third party peripheral -- which might actually zombify Steve Jobs from his slumber.But they&#x27;ll happily push a GTA port with the interface grossly adapted to the touch screen.So it&#x27;s a marketing thing: Apple is not going to be &#x27;seen with&#x27; Microsoft, but they&#x27;ll let Microsoft publish an official streaming client in their store without much fanfare. That app requires a (presumably Xbox-Microsoft-propriety-licensed) controller paired. Then I get to play top-tier games on my iPad, while Apple pretends I wouldn&#x27;t ever want to do this anyway unless it was via the touch screen. Everybody wins!One more thought: consider the battery fuel trade-off between A) running locally B) streaming ... Consider that ChromeOS can do that Xbox stream thing too, and the battery life is about 10 hours on the cheapest book (terrible 720p screen) I could buy...all despite running as an &#x27;android emulated app&#x27; (whatever that actually means in the streaming clients particular context, they could have shipped intel native binaries anyway.) I get maybe 5-8 hours on the iPad (which has a nice screen remember), but it&#x27;s not 10 hours....Anyway, my point in sharing all of this, was to illustrate why I believe advanced mobile consoles like the 3DS are going away, despite the (still accelerating) growth of mobile processing power: the future is cloud gaming, so your hand held device just needs to be an acceptable thin-client which optimizes on the appropriate things (battery life, screen quality, can I drop it on asphalt, does it easily pair controllers....) reply rtpg 8 hours agoparentprevAfter having the Switch and then bringing the 3DS on a trip recently.... I really miss the 3DS&#x2F;Vita-size devices. I know there are emulators for things but there&#x27;s something about games made for small screens and those form factors that are near perfect.The PSP and Vita were already steps towards the Switch in a sense (\"powerful handheld\" meaning suddenly PS2-level games were available portably), and the Switch kind of pushing the limits of what people accept as portable devices means that there&#x27;s almost no market pressure to go back to a small thing. But when you hold a 3DS and realize how easy it is on the move, it makes me wistful.I would mention the Game Boy Micro as well but that thing is not meant for anyone over the age of 30. reply Vanit 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been using a Razor Kishi with my phone to achieve this effect; it folds up nicely when not in use so effectively has the same travel footprint and I&#x27;ll always need my phone anyway.I still miss that immediacy of instant pause&#x2F;resume by closing the clamshell though. reply asdff 8 hours agorootparentprevAnother thing is the battery life.

    "originBody": "Back Toggle color scheme Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - Polyfills gone rogue written by@marvinhagemeist 21 September 2023 📖 tl;dr: Many popular npm packages depend on 6-8x more packages than they need to. Most of these are unnecessary polyfills and it's one of the key reasons node_modules folders are so large. The eslint ecosystem seems to be most affected by this. Part 1: PostCSS, SVGO and many more Part 2: Module resolution Part 3: Linting with eslint Part 4: npm scripts Part 5: draft-js emoji plugin Part 6: Polyfills gone rogue In the previous posts we looked at runtime performance and I thought it would be fun to look at node modules install time instead. A lot has been already written about various algorithmic optimizations or using more performant syscalls, but why do we even have this problem in the first place? Why is every node_modules folders so big? Where are all these dependencies coming from? It all started when a buddy of mine noticed something odd with the dependency tree of his project. Whenever he updated a dependency, it would pull in several new ones and with each subsequent update the total number of dependencies grew over time. ├─┬ arraybuffer.prototype.slice 1.0.2 │ └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 ├─┬ function.prototype.name 1.1.6 │ └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 ├─┬ globalthis 1.0.3 │ └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 ├─┬ object.assign 4.1.4 │ └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 ├─┬ regexp.prototype.flags 1.5.1 │ ├─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 │ └─┬ set-function-name 2.0.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 ├─┬ string.prototype.trim 1.2.8 │ └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 ├─┬ string.prototype.trimend 1.0.7 │ └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1 │ └── define-data-property 1.1.0 └─┬ string.prototype.trimstart 1.0.7 └─┬ define-properties 1.2.1└── define-data-property 1.1.0 Now to be fair, there are valid reasons why a package might depend on an additional dependencies. Here, we began to notice a pattern though: The new dependencies were all polyfills for JavaScript functions that have long been supported everywhere. The Object.defineProperties method for example was shipped as part of the very first public Node 0.10.0 release dating back to 2013. Heck, even Internet Explorer 9 supported that. And yet there were numerous packages in that dependend on a polyfill for it. Among the various packages that pulled in define-properties was eslint-plugin-react. It caught my eye, because it's very popular in the React ecosystem. Why does it pull in a polyfill for Object.defineProperties? There is no JavaScript engine that doesn't come with it already built in. Polyfills that don’t polyfill Reading the source of the packages revealed something even more bizarre: The polyfill functions were imported and called directly, rather than patching missing functionality in the runtime environment. The whole point of a polyfill is to be transparent to the user’s code. It should check if the function or method to patch is available and only add it if it’s missing. When there is no need for the polyfill it should do nothing. The odd thing to me is that the functions were used directly like a function from a library. // Why is the `define` function imported directly? var define = require(\"define-properties\"); // ... // and even worse, why is called directly? define(polyfill, {getPolyfill: getPolyfill,implementation: implementation,shim: shim, }); Instead they should call Object.defineProperties directly. The whole point of polyfills is to patch the environment not be called directly. Compare this to what a polyfill for Object.defineProperties is supposed to look like: // Check if the current environment already supports // `Object.defineProperties`. If it does, then we do nothing. if (!Object.defineProperties) {// Patch in Object.defineProperties here } The most common place where define-properties was used was ironically inside other polyfills, which loaded even more polyfills. And before you ask, the define-properties package relies on even more dependencies than just itself. var keys = require(\"object-keys\"); // ... var defineDataProperty = require(\"define-data-property\"); var supportsDescriptors = require(\"has-property-descriptors\")(); var defineProperties = function (object, map) {// ... }; module.exports = defineProperties; Inside eslint-plugin-react, that polyfill is loaded via a polyfill for Object.entries() to process their configuration: const fromEntries = require(\"object.fromentries\"); //predicate(entry[1]))); } const activeRules = filterRules(allRules, rule => !rule.meta.deprecated); Doing a little bit of housekeeping At the time of this writing installing eslint-plugin-react pulls in a whopping number of 97 dependencies in total. I was curious about how much of these were polyfills and began patching them out one by one locally. After all was done, this brought down the total number of dependencies down to 15. Out of the original 97 dependencies 82 of them are not needed. Coincidentally, eslint-plugin-import which is equally popular in various eslint presets, shows a similar problems. Installing that fills up your node_modules folder with 87 packages. After another local cleanup pass I was able to cut down that number to just 17. Filling up everyone's disk space Now you might be wondering if you’re affected or not. I did a quick search and basically every widely popular eslint plugin or preset that you can think of is affected. For some reason this whole ordeal reminds me of the is-even/is-odd incident the industry had a while back. Having so many dependencies makes it much harder to audit the dependencies of a project. It's a waste of space too. Case in point: Deleting all eslint plugins and presets in a project alone got rid of 220 packages. pnpm -r rm eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-import eslint-import-resolver-typescript eslint-config-next eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-prettier prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks Scope: all 8 workspace projects .| -220 ---------------------- Maybe we don't need that many dependencies in the first place. My mind went to this fantastic quote by the creator of the Erlang programming language: You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle - Joe Armstrong All I wanted was some linting rules. I didn’t want a bunch of polyfills that I don't need.

I manually polyfill a few necessities and quality-of-life improvements up top in the script. Out of curiosity, I removed my polyfills and tried swc and babel both, followed by an eslint pass, and the results were absolutely atrocious. Everything gets polyfilled, even stuff that has been supported in every IE version ever. The usage-based detection is completely borked, and is completely based off string searching property&#x2F;function names. Using toString() anywhere pulls in the polyfills for Date to string, Regex to string, and Object to string. Using regex anywhere pulls in a bunch of regex polyfills. It was a nightmare and the size of my library increased by orders of magnitude!(I tried opening an swc issue about optionally using typescript ast info (via a plugin, not in swc core) to have more correct usage-based polyfill detection, but that was closed as unlikely to be acted upon.) reply mhagemeister 13 hours agoparentAuthor here.That mirrors my experience too on working in various projects. The automatic polyfilling story is such a good thing in theory, but reality isn&#x27;t as rosy and much more polyfills than necessary are included. reply ComputerGuru 13 hours agorootparentThanks for writing your article and sharing! One thing I do on my other libraries is also to polyfill a few heavier things asynchronously instead of making everyone pay the price upfront, so for example I detect if a JSON polyfill is required before asynchronously loading that polyfill. I think the expectation for most things is that the browser will support them by default, and it’s ok if all&#x2F;any polyfills are loaded separately and asynchronously. reply H1Supreme 12 hours agoparentprev> I maintain a few JavaScript libraries that I manually verify compatibility against IE6Genuinely curious why anyone would target IE6 in 2023. Is it a personal goal to have massive coverage for your library? reply ComputerGuru 12 hours agorootparentIt was used in the checkout flow on our website and the marginal cost of supporting IE6 wasn’t worth a lost sale. That was many years ago, and since then I don’t think we have anyone on less than IE8 due to TLS version issues with CloudFront, but the code already supported IE6 and there aren’t many polyfills extra compared to IE10, so :shrug: reply forgotmypw17 9 hours agoparentprevThank you for supporting IE6. I also maintain some JS and ensure compatibility with older browsers. Someone out there still wants to use it, whether it&#x27;s an old machine with nostalgic value, the only machine they happen to have available, or just retro-computing enthusiasts, and I take pride in accommodating them.

There’s no doubting the positive impact he’s had on the OSS community and the work he’s done.However, there are some things he does that are incomprehensible.For example, Enzyme. Over three years ago this issue was opened for Enzyme on React 17: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enzymejs&#x2F;enzyme&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2429Nothing moved for a while, and I think he said something along the lines of “if you want React 17 support, stop complaining and help”. So the community got involved. There are multiple PRs adding React 17 support. Many unofficial React 17 adapters. A lot of people have put a lot of work into this, ensuring compatibility, coverage etc. Yet to this day, none of them have been merged. Eg https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enzymejs&#x2F;enzyme&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2564Given the amount of time that has passed, and the work the community has put in, something is amiss. It feels like he’s now intentionally avoiding React 17+ support. But why? I don’t understand why someone would ask for help then ignore the help when it comes in. That isn’t much better than the swathe of rude&#x2F;entitled comments he was getting on the issue before he locked it.I ended up migrating to RTL, but this made many of my tests more complicated (especially compared to shallow rendering). reply hashar 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d guess the issue with that project is that it is mostly a single person effort and if that person is busy with other projects&#x2F;repos&#x2F;real life, they might not have the bandwidth to keep-up with the review, loose interest or maybe did not notice the PR update in the stream of incoming requests.I guess the community (if there is any) can request to have more maintainers added to the repository to share the burden, else you still have the option to fork the repo and publish it under a different name. reply shortcake27 50 minutes agorootparentI get being busy. But it’s been three years, and he keeps saying the project isn’t dead, so he hasn’t lost interest. Also, he asked for help then largely ignored the help and&#x2F;or started bike shedding the PRs. He’s 100% across everything that happens in the repo, investing a lot of time replying to every comment immediately.I’m pretty sure people offered to become maintainers and he declined.

In projects where I have full technical control I don’t use eslint anyway, it creates a massive load of work for negligible (if any) gain. Typescript finds the important issues, prettier fixes formatting; linters just create giant swathes of useless busywork. reply Chernobog 1 hour agorootparentI think your description of linting can be true, but not necessarily for every eslint configuration. I feel that I&#x27;ve landed on configs that feel useful to myself and the rest of the devs in the team. Even with a rule set that contains many rules that can look nit picky at first glance, no one complains since they are auto fixable, and fixing is a part of a commit hook.There are a handful of rules that are nice to have in a TypeScript project to make sure devs don&#x27;t do things that break type safety. Plus some that avoids mistakes from slipping through (even though the code is reviewed).One thing I&#x27;ve found super useful is to have @typescript-eslint&#x2F;ban-ts-comment enabled, but configured so that you can still use @ts-expect-error and the others as long as you provide a comment when doing so. This is so nice when doing code reviews, either someone has provided a very good reason for the exception, or it is clear that the same result could have been achieved with a better approach. Same goes for disabling eslint rules inline in a file, also allowed if commented. I feel that this is a very good compromise between being strict with linting, but also not letting linting get in the way. reply corbezzoli 1 hour agorootparentprev> massive load of work for negligible (if any) gainIf you coded alone for 10 years and then add a strict linting config you&#x27;re going to have a really bad time.If you actually follow the advice a linter gives you, you come up a 10x better developer.Of course not all lint rules are created equal, but some are arguably existential. reply smallnamespace 11 hours agoprevThe reason libraries call polyfills directly is because it&#x27;s impolite for a library to change global scope underneath you.Usually it&#x27;s the top-level application&#x27;s author who chooses and configures polyfills.Now one may reasonably ask, why doesn&#x27;t the library just call Object.defineProperties directly, and tell the user to install the appropriate polyfill?I&#x27;m going to guess that a library that Just Works after an npm install will see much better adoption than one that requires each user to configure their babel&#x2F;swc&#x2F;etc. correctly, especially since the library can be a dependency of another library.There&#x27;s currently no standardized mechanism in the npm ecosystem to do the equivalent of \"Install this library, and also configure your environment to pull in all required polyfills\" so that the required functionality is available in global scope. One reason is because the transpilers that automatically polyfill into global scope are third-party tools.Maybe a standard mechanism like this should exist, but it doesn&#x27;t today, hence the quite reasonable choice of library authors to directly use polyfills because doing so:1. Avoids pollute the global namespace by avoiding applying a polyfill globally2. Works as a dependency without additional configuration by the user3. Preserve backwards compatibilityA somewhat cheap fix to at least reduce duplication of polyfills would be for libraries that need polyfills to accept a wide version range. That would give the package manager room to pick a version that&#x27;s compatible across call sites. reply tedunangst 11 hours agoparentBut why are we polyfilling a function that exists in every version of node? When did this code not just work after installation that it required a polyfill? reply vinnymac 11 hours agorootparentMy best guess is that the code was used in non-node environments.It wasn’t and isn’t uncommon to pull down a dependency from npm and expect it to work in multiple runtimes. reply samus 5 hours agoparentprevModifying global scope is the whole point of a polyfill though. And polyfills check themselves whether they were already applied or not.Maybe a step to a more sane situation would be reducing redundancies between polyfill libraries to ensure they don&#x27;t step on each other&#x27;s toes. reply cxr 14 hours agoprevYou&#x27;ll never get NPM apologists to acknowledge this. One of their only skills is making non-specific appeals to the necessity of it all (as essential infrastructure) and vague arguments that boil down to \"you need to trust the wisdom of the crowds\" (and e.g. the fact that it exists and everyone else is using it means that anyone who disputes its value just doesn&#x27;t understand it—bonus points for them if they manage to work in a slight that&#x27;s designed to paint you, implicitly or explicitly, as a junior), despite not being able to attest to any firsthand knowledge of the real why of anything they&#x27;re defending.> The new dependencies were all polyfills for JavaScript functions that have long been supported everywhere. The Object.defineProperties method for example was shipped as part of the very first public Node 0.10.0 release dating back to 2013. Heck, even Internet Explorer 9 supported that. And yet there were numerous packages in that dependend on a polyfill for it. reply cogman10 14 hours agoparentBack in 2011ish or so when npm was just getting started and Ruby on rails was all the rage. \"Do not repeat yourself\" was seen as a gold standard for programming. The end result has been a mess, particularly for npm. There were FAR too many articles talking about how \"there&#x27;s no such thing as too small a dependency\" and talks given about how much a virtue it was to create \"is-odd\" or \"is-even\" \"look you saved 3 lines of code that you don&#x27;t have to test!\"Unfortunately, that compounded with browser of the era (Internet explorer...) having basically 0 support for modern javascript led to a proliferation of dependencies, polyfills, etc that are nearly impossible to remove from the ecosystem.I&#x27;ve not seen a lot of node apologists that are fine with the current ecoystem. The problem is righting the ship is going to be terribly hard. Either existing frameworks&#x2F;libraries need to go through the effort of saying \"Ok, do I really need is-even, let&#x27;s remove it\" or we need new frameworks&#x2F;libraries to abandon tools and the ecosystem in favor of fatter and fewer dependencies.I think the issue all stems from the fact that before 2010ish, there was one library and one framework, jquery (Ok, there were others... but were there really?) and that added a good 1mb to any webpage. The notion was we do more with less if we had a bunch of smaller deps that didn&#x27;t need to be brought in. reply josephg 13 hours agorootparent> \"Do not repeat yourself\" was seen as a gold standard for programming.I remember this era. I’ve been using nodejs before npm existed and so many silly things have happened in that time.I think the core problem the JS ecosystem has always had is that most JS developers are relatively inexperienced. (JS is very beginner friendly and this is the price we pay). I still vividly remember being at nodecamp in 2012 or something listening to someone tell me how great it would be if the entire OS was written in javascript. It didn’t matter how much I poked and prodded him, he couldn’t hear that it might not be an amazing idea. I think he thought it would be easier to reimplement an OS kernel in JS than it would be to just learn C. And there were lots of people around with a sparkle in their eye and those sort of wacky ideas - good or bad. It was fun and in hindsight a very silly time.So yeah, of course some idiot in JS made is-even. And is-odd (which depends on is-even). I see all of this as the characteristic mistake of youth - that we go looking for overly simple rules about what is good and bad (JS good! C bad!) and then we make a mess. When we’re young we lack discernment about subtle questions. When is it better to pull in a library vs writing it yourself inline? When is JS a good or a bad idea? When should you add comments, or tests? And when do you leave them out?Most of the best engineers I know made these sort of stupid philosophical mistakes when they were young. I certainly did. The JS ecosystem just suffers disproportionately from this kind of thing because so many packages in npm are written by relatively new developers.I think that’s a good thing for our industry as a whole.

The correct solution is to use Typescript and assert the input is a number.The Number.isSafeInteger check is an interesting one. Yes, it&#x27;s not \"safe\" to work with a number outside this but no doubt something in the function would be broken before an is-odd check if it was relied upon.Often the edge case someone else catered to is something counter to my expectation. I would rather write two lines of code myself and be aware of the behaviour. reply phire 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s hard to tell.The author of both packages has since moved the github repos to an organisation named \"i-voted-for-trump\" and labelled the packages with the \"troll-bait\" tag.But the author also claims those packages where created when they were learning to program, and they seem to have stuck with the idea of small libraries (just not quite that small). The changes seem to be due to grief the programming community has given him about those packages, as some of the worst examples of the pattern.I suspect the author was being slightly satirical by choosing to do the simplest possible NPM library. But at the same time they probably believed it was a useful package, allowing new programmers (like himself) to calculate the evenness&#x2F;oddness of numbers without needing to know or google the mod-2 trick. And if you are going to learn how to create npm packages, might as well start small.If they were aiming to be slightly satirical, they were not expecting that level of outrage.It&#x27;s worth pointing out that the libraries do slightly more than just mod-2.

So the bundler could then downlevel or polyfill the code for the specified targets. reply bsimpson 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve always been kind of surprised that original sources aren&#x27;t part of the NPM culture. For a long time, I included \"typescript:main\" in my package.jsons and configured my tools to prefer that to \"main\" (and now \"module\"). reply MBCook 6 hours agoparentprevI get not defining it yourself, especially if your polyfill is limited to the sliver of a feature you use, but why not check if the feature is there first?Ok, maybe someone else monkeypatched it. But at least you’d end up using the native functionality if it was there. reply petetnt 14 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t really care to comment about the practice itself, but the \"Polyfills that don’t polyfill\" section is missing the point: the function is called directly instead of patching the global object so that the global object is not polluted by an possibly non-standard implementation. Additionally it does use Object.defineProperty if available - furthermore it doesn&#x27;t even call itself a polyfill in the first place. If it&#x27;s needed in 2023 is a valid point however. reply fiddlerwoaroof 14 hours agoparentI think it would be better to just expect the standardized functions to be present and then document that the project needs them (e.g. via peer dependencies), allowing users to install them themselves as needed. reply shpx 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a lot more work than your library just working in more places. reply fiddlerwoaroof 13 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s all that much more: basically every bundler I’ve used uses browserslist to include polyfills for the developer’s target audience.But, also, I think this sort of easy path inflicts a huge cost on the ecosystem as a whole: writing to the standards and expecting your users to supply a compliant environment solves a lot of N*M problems in the dev process. reply chatmasta 10 hours agoprevSometimes it can be a security vulnerability to call a polyfill instead of the now available default implementation. For example, this 2018 bug [0] in the Grammarly Chrome Extension had a much wider impact due to its reliance on a fetch polyfill that was able to make requests (via XHR) to origins that native fetch could not.I suppose in that case you could argue the real bug is in the XHR API, but it only affected the extension because the extension was using a fetch polyfill that relied on it in functions that could be triggered by an external page.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerone.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;389108 reply mhagemeister 4 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s a very good point. Didn&#x27;t know about the grammarly incident. I could definitely see this happening again with the amount of polyfills in npm packages. Polyfills are usually frozen in time and not developed further after they are released. reply jongjong 9 hours agoprevIn the early days of the Node.js ecosystem, there was a trend which was all about &#x27;tiny modules&#x27;; many developers published tiny 10-line or so modules and people in the community were promoting these tiny modules really hard. It went a bit out of control and a lot of higher level modules were including many of those tiny modules, then those modules were themselves included into other, even higher level modules, etc... The number of modules used by some of these higher level modules&#x2F;tools&#x2F;frameworks grew exponentially and we ended up with a lot of unnecessary dependencies.Each tiny module did just a bit more than it should have done or included just one more dependency than was necessary, sometimes the scope of the module would grow over time and all this added up. Also, different sub-modules used different sub-sub-modules for the same functionality so this caused a lot of duplication in the higher level modules.For my own open source project, I&#x27;ve always been very careful about which dependencies I use. I favor module authors who try to keep their number of dependencies to a minimum. A lot of times, it comes down to figuring out the correct scope of the module... Most low level libraries should not need to do their own logging; therefore, they should not need to include sub-modules to colorize the bash output; instead, they should just emit events and let higher level modules handle the logging. Anyway there are many cases like that where modules give themselves too much scope. reply DanielHB 32 minutes agoparentI think a lot of the sentiment behind this was that the module system and bundlers didn&#x27;t really support tree shaking so bringing in a big library with a lot of utility functions brought in a ton of code you didn&#x27;t need. reply jluxenberg 14 hours agoprevFor what it&#x27;s worth; `eslint-plugin-react` has been around for a long time and seems to support running in very old versions of Node.JS (back to v4[1] apparently! tho I can&#x27;t find anything documenting that for sure.)I was surprised to learn that Object.values is only supported in Node >v7, Object.fronEntries was added in v12, etc. So for this project maybe the polyfills are needed.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsx-eslint&#x2F;eslint-plugin-react&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1038 reply phire 11 hours agoparentThere are two separate questions:\"Should libraries still be polyfilling to support ancient runtimes?\" and \"How should that polyfilling be implemented?\"Even if a library wants to maintain backwards compatibility, we can still argue this method of polyfilling (especially the phony polyfills) is damaging to the wider javascript ecosystem.In an ideal world, the cost of polyfills for developers who don&#x27;t need them should be zero.For developers using bundlers, the bundler is expected to implement any required polyfills for the developer&#x27;s targeted runtimes, and having the library ship with it&#x27;s own polyfills is counterproductive at best. However, I suspect these libraries wish to maintain compatibility for developers not using bundlers.Maybe npm should be upgraded to support multiple variants of packages? That way these libraries could ship both polyfilled and non-polyfilled versions of their packages in parallel. reply mhagemeister 13 hours agoparentprevYeah, engines are a moving target. I&#x27;m all for backwards compatibility, but I&#x27;m worried about promoting old node versions with known unpatched security issues. Given that eslint itself only supports node >= 12.22.0 it seems like it&#x27;s time to get rid of the polyfills.I wish we as in the industry would find a better solution to adapt to this. It&#x27;s a bit unfortunate that the polyfills as part of the library code itself, which makes it difficult to get rid of them once they&#x27;re not needed anymore. reply gigel82 13 hours agoparentprevGenuinely curious, are there people out there using newer versions of this package with old &#x2F; unsupported versions of Node (in production)? reply silverwind 11 hours agorootparentNot really.

    "originBody": "Writing Software, technology, sysadmin war stories, and more. Thursday, September 21, 2023 The customer stuck due to a hurricane who needed ssh One problem with working in a customer support environment is that you tend to lose track of just how many tasks you've completed. After a few hours, most of them get pretty fuzzy, and by the end of the week, only the most notable ones stand out. A month later, it's even worse than that. This is just how it goes when there's so much quantity passing by. This is why I tried to take notes about a handful of them as they happened. After a certain point, the memories start losing \"cohesion\" (whatever) and then it might as well be \"fiction inspired by real life\". A fair number of my posts are sourced from these notes. It's how I can still give some details all these years later without making them up. Here's something that came in one night almost 20 years ago while working web hosting tech support. A customer wrote in. They opened an \"emergency: emergency\" ticket, which is usually reserved for \"OMFG my server is down please fix0r\" type events. It actually had a HTML blink tag baked into the very string so it would blink in our browsers. It was hard to miss. It was a Monday night. What they said, more or less: \"Three things. I have a Tuesday deadline. I'm stuck in (some airport) because of the weather problems from Hurricane Jeanne in Atlanta. I can't connect to port 22 because the wireless in the airport seems to firewall it off.\" \"So, if not for that, I wouldn't call this 'emergency'. Also, I can't get to webmin to add another port myself. So, can you open up another sshd on port NNNN (since I know that gets through) so I can get to the machine?\" They ended this with a \"Thank you\" with a bunch of exclamation points and even a 1. (Whether they were trying to be KIBO or B1FF, I may never know.) They opened this ticket at 7:40. About five minutes later, one of our frontline responders saw it in the queue (probably noticed the *blinking*), mentioned it out loud, and after a short discussion assigned it to one of the people on the floor. At 7:50, we responded, stating that some iptables magic (shown in the ticket) had been done to let sshd answer on port NNNN in addition to port 22. Also, there was a note added to clarify that this was made persistent, such that it would persist across reboots. The customer was then asked to try connecting and to let us know if that didn't work out. Why iptables instead of a second ssh daemon? It was way faster, for one thing, and time was of the essence. You could run the two commands: one to add the rule, and one to make it persistent, and then the customer is good to go. Standing up a second sshd instance on a separate port back in those days would have meant wrangling init scripts to make a second version that points at a slightly different config file. Also, it would create something of a maintenance issue down the road as that forked config would quickly become forgotten. Sure, someone could have run \"sshd -p NNNN\", but then they'd have to make sure it kept running, and if it got whacked somehow (reboot?), the customer would be screwed again with their deadline looming. Also, in terms of cleanup, the customer could just flip the -I (insert) in the iptables command to -D (delete) and save it to make it disappear for good later. Tidying the second-sshd thing would have more fiddly. In any case, the customer came back a few minutes later, thanked us for the work, and promised to clean it up when they were clear of the problem. We didn't hear back, so things apparently worked out. I hope they made their deadline. More writingContact / send feedback",

For every engineer there&#x27;s probably hundreds or thousands of customers. If they had to engage immediately with every support case, there would be zero progress on any other job.The problem actually comes from the fact that big tech is becoming increasingly cheap on creating good support organizations. Experienced support engineers are fired and replaced with outsourced low-cost inexperienced personnel. In most cases, issues can be resolved or worked around with the help of a support engineer with access to some extra knobs. When those engineers are removed and are replaced with people who act like a pipe for cat to send the customer&#x27;s stdout to product engineers, you get what you describe. reply nvarsj 3 hours agoparentprevThere is very little incentive for engineers to spend a lot of time on support at big tech. In fact it detracts time from their projects which tie to their performance review.Internally big tech would need to prioritise customer satisfaction as some OKR to incentivise engineers - but this doesn’t happen for some reason. As a result you’re at the whim of whether the engineer cares enough to spend time on your case.Note in my experience AWS has great support - so their internal incentives seem to be aligned with customers. reply supriyo-biswas 2 minutes agorootparentSupport engineers are usually a completely different team and unrelated to engineering teams. reply Amezarak 34 minutes agorootparentprevI see comments like this on HN frequently and I wonder what is going on with BigTech.

You can also have it bind to the port as root then drop permissions afterwards. reply fiddlerwoaroof 7 hours agorootparentYeah, but requiring the process to start as root adds a window of vulnerability and the process has to drop privileges correctly.You could also do it in the load balancer&#x2F;router. reply superb_dev 4 hours agorootparentSystemd can setup the privileges before starting the process reply dijit 2 hours agorootparentprevthis is actually dangerous advice.The reason privileged ports require root is so that they cannot be easily intercepted by userland processes.The entire reason for the root requirement is this; it&#x27;s expected that after your port assignment you drop your privileges to a lesser user. But requiring root to bind is a feature, not a bug.If you do not have this then intentionally crashing the process for a user and rebinding the port as a standard user (even `nobody`) is possible.This means if you break into someones mail server and run as the mail user, you would be able to bind ssh ports (if they are not privileged ports socat to tcp out->socat on another computer to listen->a serial port out.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Distilling step-by-step: Outperforming larger language models with less training data and smaller model sizes Philosophy Research Areas Publications People Resources Outreach Careers Blog BLOG › Distilling step-by-step: Outperforming larger language models with less training data and smaller model sizes THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2023 Posted by Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Student Researcher, and Chen-Yu Lee, Research Scientist, Cloud AI Team Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance. To circumvent these deployment challenges, practitioners often choose to deploy smaller specialized models instead. These smaller models are trained using one of two common paradigms: fine-tuning or distillation. Fine-tuning updates a pre-trained smaller model (e.g., BERT or T5) using downstream manually-annotated data. Distillation trains the same smaller models with labels generated by a larger LLM. Unfortunately, to achieve comparable performance to LLMs, fine-tuning methods require human-generated labels, which are expensive and tedious to obtain, while distillation requires large amounts of unlabeled data, which can also be hard to collect. In “Distilling Step-by-Step! Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes”, presented at ACL2023, we set out to tackle this trade-off between model size and training data collection cost. We introduce distilling step-by-step, a new simple mechanism that allows us to train smaller task-specific models with much less training data than required by standard fine-tuning or distillation approaches that outperform few-shot prompted LLMs’ performance. We demonstrate that the distilling step-by-step mechanism enables a 770M parameter T5 model to outperform the few-shot prompted 540B PaLM model using only 80% of examples in a benchmark dataset, which demonstrates a more than 700x model size reduction with much less training data required by standard approaches. While LLMs offer strong zero and few-shot performance, they are challenging to serve in practice. On the other hand, traditional ways of training small task-specific models require a large amount of training data. Distilling step-by-step provides a new paradigm that reduces both the deployed model size as well as the number of data required for training. Distilling step-by-step The key idea of distilling step-by-step is to extract informative natural language rationales (i.e., intermediate reasoning steps) from LLMs, which can in turn be used to train small models in a more data-efficient way. Specifically, natural language rationales explain the connections between the input questions and their corresponding outputs. For example, when asked, “Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. If she already has 16 square feet of carpet, how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?”, an LLM can be prompted by the few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique to provide intermediate rationales, such as, “Area = length * width. Jesse’s room has 11 * 15 square feet.” That better explains the connection from the input to the final answer, “(11 * 15 ) - 16”. These rationales can contain relevant task knowledge, such as “Area = length * width”, that may originally require many data for small models to learn. We utilize these extracted rationales as additional, richer supervision to train small models, in addition to the standard task labels. Overview on distilling step-by-step: First, we utilize CoT prompting to extract rationales from an LLM. We then use the generated rationales to train small task-specific models within a multi-task learning framework, where we prepend task prefixes to the input examples and train the model to output differently based on the given task prefix. Distilling step-by-step consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we leverage few-shot CoT prompting to extract rationales from LLMs. Specifically, given a task, we prepare few-shot exemplars in the LLM input prompt where each example is composed of a triplet containing: (1) input, (2) rationale, and (3) output. Given the prompt, an LLM is able to mimic the triplet demonstration to generate the rationale for any new input. For instance, in a commonsense question answering task, given the input question “Sammy wanted to go to where the people are. Where might he go? Answer Choices: (a) populated areas, (b) race track, (c) desert, (d) apartment, (e) roadblock”, distilling step-by-step provides the correct answer to the question, “(a) populated areas”, paired with the rationale that provides better connection from the question to the answer, “The answer must be a place with a lot of people. Of the above choices, only populated areas have a lot of people.” By providing CoT examples paired with rationales in the prompt, the in-context learning ability allows LLMs to output corresponding rationales for future unseen inputs. We use the few-shot CoT prompting, which contains both an example rationale (highlighted in green) and a label (highlighted in blue), to elicit rationales from an LLM on new input examples. The example is from a commonsense question answering task. After the rationales are extracted, in the second stage, we incorporate the rationales in training small models by framing the training process as a multi-task problem. Specifically, we train the small model with a novel rationale generation task in addition to the standard label prediction task. The rationale generation task enables the model to learn to generate the intermediate reasoning steps for the prediction, and guides the model to better predict the resultant label. We prepend task prefixes (i.e., [label] and [rationale] for label prediction and rationale generation, respectively) to the input examples for the model to differentiate the two tasks. Experimental setup In the experiments, we consider a 540B PaLM model as the LLM. For task-specific downstream models, we use T5 models. For CoT prompting, we use the original CoT prompts when available and curate our own examples for new datasets. We conduct the experiments on four benchmark datasets across three different NLP tasks: e-SNLI and ANLI for natural language inference; CQA for commonsense question answering; and SVAMP for arithmetic math word problems. We include two sets of baseline methods. For comparison to few-shot prompted LLMs, we compare to few-shot CoT prompting with a 540B PaLM model. In the paper, we also compare standard task-specific model training to both standard fine-tuning and standard distillation. In this blogpost, we will focus on the comparisons to standard fine-tuning for illustration purposes. Less training data Compared to standard fine-tuning, the distilling step-by-step method achieves better performance using much less training data. For instance, on the e-SNLI dataset, we achieve better performance than standard fine-tuning when using only 12.5% of the full dataset (shown in the upper left quadrant below). Similarly, we achieve a dataset size reduction of 75%, 25% and 20% on ANLI, CQA, and SVAMP. Distilling step-by-step compared to standard fine-tuning using 220M T5 models on varying sizes of human-labeled datasets. On all datasets, distilling step-by-step is able to outperform standard fine-tuning, trained on the full dataset, by using much less training examples. Smaller deployed model size Compared to few-shot CoT prompted LLMs, distilling step-by-step achieves better performance using much smaller model sizes. For instance, on the e-SNLI dataset, we achieve better performance than 540B PaLM by using a 220M T5 model. On ANLI, we achieve better performance than 540B PaLM by using a 770M T5 model, which is over 700X smaller. Note that on ANLI, the same 770M T5 model struggles to match PaLM’s performance using standard fine-tuning. We perform distilling step-by-step and standard fine-tuning on varying sizes of T5 models and compare their performance to LLM baselines, i.e., Few-shot CoT and PINTO Tuning. Distilling step-by-step is able to outperform LLM baselines by using much smaller models, e.g., over 700× smaller models on ANLI. Standard fine-tuning fails to match LLM’s performance using the same model size. Distilling step-by-step outperforms few-shot LLMs with smaller models using less data Finally, we explore the smallest model sizes and the least amount of data for distilling step-by-step to outperform PaLM’s few-shot performance. For instance, on ANLI, we surpass the performance of the 540B PaLM using a 770M T5 model. This smaller model only uses 80% of the full dataset. Meanwhile, we observe that standard fine-tuning cannot catch up with PaLM’s performance even using 100% of the full dataset. This suggests that distilling step-by-step simultaneously reduces the model size as well as the amount of data required to outperform LLMs. We show the minimum size of T5 models and the least amount of human-labeled examples required for distilling step-by-step to outperform LLM’s few-shot CoT by a coarse-grained search. Distilling step-by-step is able to outperform few-shot CoT using not only much smaller models, but it also achieves so with much less training examples compared to standard fine-tuning. Conclusion We propose distilling step-by-step, a novel mechanism that extracts rationales from LLMs as informative supervision in training small, task-specific models. We show that distilling step-by-step reduces both the training dataset required to curate task-specific smaller models and the model size required to achieve, and even surpass, a few-shot prompted LLM’s performance. Overall, distilling step-by-step presents a resource-efficient paradigm that tackles the trade-off between model size and training data required.

Until then, I’m assuming their presumed ai supremacy is marketing reply behnamoh 7 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s AI-research supremacy and there&#x27;s AI-product supremacy. Google has many brains (pun intended) on the former, but lacks incentive&#x2F;structure for the latter. reply 6D794163636F756 6 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re often also slow to market. They weren&#x27;t the first search engine, they weren&#x27;t the first email platform, they weren&#x27;t the first video site, but now they&#x27;re the biggest in those categories. I think Bard&#x27;s growth will be very interesting to watch given that track record.Or it&#x27;ll get dropped within a year. reply behnamoh 6 hours agorootparent> They&#x27;re...It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the Google you&#x27;re talking about was way way different than it is today. Google Search was a startup. Google Search + Email was a small company. Google Search + Email + YouTube was a midsize firm. Now they&#x27;re a humungous megacorp that&#x27;s slow to make necessary changes when there&#x27;s a paradigm shift like LLMs. reply hansworst 33 minutes agorootparentArguably Google is the company that triggered that paradigm shift by publicly sharing (some of) their work on AI like the transformer&#x2F;attention paper. So if anything they were ahead of the curve in terms of research. They&#x27;re also extremely well positioned in terms of training data, infrastructure capabilities, hardware (TPUs), they had the first popular machine learning library (TensorFlow), etc.Lately you could argue they&#x27;re being overtaken by their competitors, especially in terms of productization. But they still hold pretty cards IMO. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprevAlso keep in mind that YouTube was an acquisition. reply d3vmax 3 hours agorootparentprevI agree with the point you are trying to make, but Google Search + Email was not a small company.

They fired a bunch of people and are integrating LLMs all over the place.OAI had a big head start for sure. reply ttul 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not getting dropped. If OpenAI’s models get good enough, search traffic will crater and Google will fall on extremely hard times for lack of ad revenue. At the same time, if they fail to integrate state of the art generative features into Workspace, people will go to Microsoft, where GPT-4 is presently handing Google their ass. Yes, Google Duet for Workspace totally sucks; I suspect their trial conversion rate approaches 0%.This is a make it or break it problem for Google and they will get it right or they won’t get it at all. reply piyushpr134 3 hours agorootparentnot at all. I feel (this data is from running SEM for large website(s)) that Google earns most of their revenue from tactical searches. For instance, most people search for website names instead of typing the url. This creates a massive tactical search traffic base for google and brings largest revenue for them. There is a huge competition in this category as most competitors bid on others.Similarly, product searches are second largest category in which they make tonnes of money. This is also done by people as they don&#x27;t really like to search on amazon or other ecommerce sites. This is also a huge money spinner for them.Both of these are not going anywhere as both of these are tactical spends.Now let us come to long tail. These are again big money and are at risk for Google. However, you have to understand that Goog ads are clicked by most tier 2 users. We, techies, do not really click at ads. We go for organic ranking (mostly). We are the base of chatGPT right now. Tier 2 and lower users don&#x27;t really use chatgpt.Even if they do, they would not do it for product discovery or site discovery as it has too much friction: go to chat.openai.com, type in your question, it responds in slow, jerky manner vs just type in browser bar what you are thinking.To top it, Chatgpt also has stale data. Moreover, it is heavily lobotomized to not give any controversial or edgy answers. This curtails usefulness of chatgpt. reply azinman2 4 hours agorootparentprevHave you switched to chatgpt for everything you googled? I haven’t. And most of the time I’m wanting destinations versus a specific answer. reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentI have a browser extension (ChatGPTBox) that puts ChatGPT one click away on every DDG search I do, and it&#x27;s certainly now often where I go next if DDG doesn&#x27;t get me the result vs appending \"!g\" (to send the search to Google).In that respect it&#x27;s not replacing all my searches, but it seems to be replacing the \"hard ones\" where it&#x27;s hard to compete with Google at a disproportional rate. If that is actually the case, it&#x27;d spell bad news for Google whether or not it kills search - if it becomes cheaper&#x2F;easier to compete by offering a mix of less complete search with an OpenAI integration, it opens the door for far more attempts at competing with them. reply carom 2 hours agorootparentprevI have for programming searches. ChatGPT can give me things that would take 5+ minutes of searching to hone in on. Then again, I run an ad blocker so no loss for them. reply victorbjorklund 13 minutes agorootparentHonestly google probably doesnt make any money at all on searches like \"how do call rust from python?\". They make money on searches with buy intent where people search for \"buy gps for car\" reply davedx 2 hours agorootparentprevFor any domain specific questions or discussions I use ChatGPT because it’s so much better than Google. People underestimate how many fields it’s already valuable in beyond programming.I use Google for basic bitch things like finding a company website or what time is it in Tokyo. reply behnamoh 6 hours agorootparentprevThere was a graph that showed Google&#x27;s search didn&#x27;t get affected much after ChatGPT was announced. reply Mistletoe 1 hour agorootparentI tried to replace it but ChatGPT is slower, wordier, not up to date, and sometimes hallucinates, so I just went back to quick google searches. reply thfuran 26 minutes agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a little unfair since those things predate Google&#x27;s existence. Nobody&#x27;s that fast to market. reply mellosouls 6 hours agorootparentprevThey were the best search engine from the get-go and had a massive impact. Gmail&#x2F;maps also to a lesser extent.In AI they were giants in what looks post-ChatGPT like a mediocre field. Their search now is looking very jaded.The trajectory here isn&#x27;t remotely like their past performances; it&#x27;s not a safe bet to assume they&#x27;ll win through with Bard or anything else.The agility of OpenAI and the revolutionary impact of gpt3+ has made the former incumbents like Google look like posturing, self-satisfied, giant lumbering has-beens. They aren&#x27;t getting back on top without massive internal changes. reply antupis 4 hours agorootparentprevGoogle 2023 is completely different company than it was in 2005.

They adopted some patterns Phind took in early interfaces with citations and made it much better in terms of interaction and response time compared to what Phind is doing today.Also, with more recent changes I can get decent summaries much easier (and at no cost to me) for every document in a google drive.In my day to day, those features can be pretty powerful tool, even if its not at GPT4 level 6 months after GPT4 and Bard were released in March.To my knowledge, no one is really integrating search at the level that Google is with generative language models. reply Palmik 4 hours agorootparentBing has citations, Perplexity has citations, etc.I would not be surprised if ChatGPT moves some of the plugins to the free tier as well, to stay competitive over the longer term. reply druskacik 2 hours agoparentprevThe article is just a fine-tuning concept that could have been published by anyone, using any large LLM and small LLM in combination. This has nothing to do with marketing. reply fbnbr 3 hours agoprevI think smaller expert models will dominate the majority of applications. there is an optimum and fine balance to strike when it comes to size and usability. There will be many mechanisms like demonstrated in the post to find that optimum and realize it. reply pedrovhb 7 hours agoprevInteresting that they use T5 for the distilled model. I was under the impression that encoder-decoder architectures were on the way of the Dodo, but it seems they may still be relevant after all.Also interesting is that this isn&#x27;t an inconceivably clever and out of the box idea. It shows there&#x27;s still a lot of low hanging fruit to explore, and the future of LLMs isn&#x27;t set in stone yet. Could be that the real deal is a mixture of experts trained in this style. It&#x27;s exciting that it feels the holy grail is close to being achievable if only the right combination of ideas is tried. reply rolisz 5 hours agoparentT5 family is awesome.

Answer Choices: (a) populated areas, (b) race track, (c) desert, (d) apartment, (e) roadblock”, distilling step-by-step provides the correct answer to the question, “(a) populated areas”Huh? My answer as a human would have been \"race track\", as that is probably \"where the people are\" (during a race).Did I fail? Am I a poor language model? Or is the whole thing just tea leaf reading to begin with? reply Reubend 5 hours agoparent> Did I fail? Am I a poor language model? Or is the whole thing just tea leaf reading to begin with?No offense to you, but I never would have picked \"race track\". That answer doesn&#x27;t make much sense since the original prompt doesn&#x27;t mention anything about racing, and the definition of a populated area fits well with the question being asked. reply diziet 1 hour agoparentprevA google image search for \"race track\" has 0 people visible in the 17 images above the fold. reply smeagull 6 hours agoparentprevA race track or an apartment are likely to be populated areas as well. \"A\" is a broader answer that encompasses more possibilities. reply p-e-w 6 hours agorootparent\"Where the people are\" doesn&#x27;t simply mean \"where a large number of people live\". It also has connotations of \"where it&#x27;s happening\", as in \"where people are coming together (right now)\".But my point is really that speaking of the correct answer with a question as vague and open to interpretation as this one is absurd. reply BoorishBears 5 hours agorootparentIf you really want to go full logician on this, even the format in which you&#x27;re asked the question should make (a) being the correct answer clear.You&#x27;re being asked a multiple choice question:- There&#x27;s an implication of intended vagueness&#x2F;indirection and multiple possibly suitable answers.- Textual entailment is a very common type of multiple choice format, which would lean towards a more plain semantic correlation reply kybernetikos 1 hour agorootparentIndeed, I pattern matched (a) as the correct answer too, but on reflection on the content of the words and what it would all actually mean, I think that (a) is a bad answer. If we aren&#x27;t careful we&#x27;ll train our AIs to be good at giving incorrect, pat answers to inadequately thought out questions. reply Zuiii 6 hours agorootparentprevA depending on the size of a \"populated area\", the density can be far lower than a crowded race track. reply kybernetikos 3 hours agorootparentYeah \"I felt lonely and wanted to be where the people are, so I wandered through the suburbs\" really doesn&#x27;t make sense. I think this is just a bad question. reply ilaksh 5 hours agoprevI am not a researcher, but it always seemed intuitive to me that the most effective models would be multimodal and trained with a core carefully tailored curriculum.I would want to ensure that the system gains and retains the fundamental structures and skills that you know it needs to effectively and accurately generalize. While maintaining those things you then feed it lots of diverse data to learn the exceptions and ways the skills can be combined. But somehow you need to ensure those core skills and knowledge throughout. Maybe you could do that just by including outputting those understandings or manipulations in addition to the final answer. Similar to what the paper does.For example, a code generation model might be required to output a state machine simulation of the requested program. reply eru 5 hours agoparentI agree that multimodal seems like the way to go, but it&#x27;s not at all intuitive why we should expect the curriculum needing to be carefully tailored. Compare https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gwern.net&#x2F;scaling-hypothesis reply mcmoor 4 hours agorootparentYeah so far looking at the progression since 70s, domain-specific attempts stagnant while just-increase-the-input-and-core attempts get us where we are now reply two_in_one 3 hours agorootparentMy impression is that while domain specific models do better in their domain. They do not generalize well and cannot be transferred to different domains without retraining. Hence comes mixture of experts (domain specifics). The trick is to juggle them all. Which needs another quite capable &#x27;manager&#x27; model. The good thing is that they can be trained separately. Also at inference there in no need to call them all. Existing models, like GPT-4, can be used to create datasets for experts, or enhance&#x2F;balance existing datasets. reply sinuhe69 8 hours agoprevWhy the amount of the training data for LLM is less than for the distilled and task-specific models (in the first figure)?Or did the authors count the amount of training data for the LLMs to the required training data for the destined&#x2F;task-specific models?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogger.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;b&#x2F;R29vZ2xl&#x2F;AVvXsEj... reply swsieber 8 hours agoparent> Or did the authors count the amount of training data for the LLMs to the required training data for the destined&#x2F;task-specific models?Yes.They are counting the amount of data you need to collect to solve your problem.

ML is eating the world by storm and one thing Apple loves is high margins. Folks like myself would gladly pay that margin to someone besides Nvidia. I paid $2k for my last GPU and was happy to do it. That doesn’t even factor the fact that businesses would pay even more when the alternative are machines that start in the tens of thousands for just the GPU ability. GPUs right now are carrying fat margins and that makes more than enough incentive for Apple IMHO. reply behnamoh 6 hours agorootparentBut you wouldn&#x27;t be able to upgrade an Apple Mac when the next generation of LLMs is out. replyziofill 8 hours agoprev [–] Is it that a lot of capacity is unused in those behemoth LLMs, or that the smaller language model just mimics the reasoning task? (Mimics the mimicking?) reply og_kalu 8 hours agoparentThere is no actual distinction between the \"real\" thing and \"mimicking\".The datasets behemoth LLMs are trained on include a lot of noise that derail progress. They also just contain a lot of irrelevant knowledge that the LLM has to learn or memorize so an obscene amount of parameters is required.When you&#x27;re not trying to teach a language model the sum total of human knowledge and you provide a high quality curated dataset, the scale barrier is much lower.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.07759 reply behnamoh 7 hours agorootparentWhy don&#x27;t people just train LLMs on pure Wikipedia, arXiv, and other scientific websites? That would reduce the noise and improve hallucinations, no? reply brucethemoose2 6 hours agorootparentThat is essentially Phi. The results are promising.But LLMs do gain useful \"emergent\" properties from training on massive lower quality datasets. reply astrange 5 hours agorootparentprevIt has to learn the meaning of words, including implicit associations, and to do that it needs to see approximately all the English text ever.

Real people don&#x27;t learn English like that, for example.It&#x27;s just that given what we know about neural networks, it&#x27;s often easier and simpler and more effective to increase the amount of training data than to change anything else. reply vczf 7 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it would know how to have a conversation if it&#x27;s never been exposed to one before. reply taneq 5 hours agorootparentThat’s what the fine tuning is about.

Photograph: PjrTravel/Alamy Schools Call to shut down Bristol schools’ use of app to ‘monitor’ pupils and families Exclusive: Think Family Education app gives safeguarding leads easy access to pupils’ and relatives’ contacts with police and child protection Steven Morris @stevenmorris20 Thu 21 Sep 2023 13.02 BST Criminal justice and antiracist campaigners have raised concerns over an app being used by schools in Bristol to “monitor and profile” pupils and their families. The app, which is being used by more than 100 schools, gives safeguarding leads quick, easy access to pupils’ and their families’ contacts with police, child protection and welfare services. One of the concerns campaigners have is that the Think Family Education (TFE) app includes analysing which children could be at risk of exposure to criminality, which they argue risks leading to more discrimination against pupils from minority ethnic or working-class backgrounds. Staff using the app have told the criminal justice campaign charity Fair Trials that they keep it secret from parents and carers, and admitted many would be concerned about it if they knew of it. Bristol city council and Avon and Somerset police, who worked together on the system, insist it is in place to protect children, not criminalise them, and deny it is secret, pointing out that information about its existence is publicly available. But Fair Trials said the vast majority of parents would know nothing about the app. Griff Ferris, the charity’s senior legal and policy officer, said: “Schoolchildren should not be monitored, profiled and criminalised by secretive police databases. Surveillance is not safeguarding. “Systems like this uphold existing discrimination against children and families from minoritised ethnic and more deprived backgrounds. This system is expanding the net of surveillance. It should be shut down.” A spokesperson for the antiracist organisation No More Exclusions Bristol said: “Technologies that gather and use information in the name of ‘public safety’ overwhelmingly reproduce racialised ideas of problematic behaviour.” Liz Fekete, the director of the Institute of Race Relations, strongly criticised elements of the app, saying the approach “stigmatises whole families and leaves even primary school children vulnerable to police surveillance and intelligence gathering”. When it was consulted, the Bristol City Youth Council, an elected group of young people, expressed reservations that if the system was not used properly it could lead to “prejudice and judgment”. Systems to collate information about children are used in other parts of England but Bristol city council describes Think Family as “innovative” and a number of local authorities are watching how the app works. On its website, the council says the Think Family database, which the app draws on, includes information from about 50,000 families across the city collected from agencies including social care, police and the Department for Work and Pensions. It says it highlights “vulnerabilities or needs” and uses “targeted analytics” to help identify children at risk of sexual or criminal exploitation. Critics say the reality is that this risks children from minority ethnic or poorer backgrounds being profiled as being involved in gangs or county lines operations. Schools using the TFE app receive alerts about children’s and family members’ contact with police, antisocial behaviour and domestic violence incidents. The system also gives schools access to sensitive personal details about families’ financial situations. School safeguarding leads told Fair Trials that they kept the system secret from children and their families. One said: “They [parents and carers] wouldn’t know about this ... parents will have no kind of sight of it at all ... They just don’t know of its existence.” They described the system as “an early warning process” and admitted: “I think there’s a bit of a risk it getting out there that schools hold this kind of central bank of information.” A spokesperson for Bristol city council said the Think Family database was introduced to counter the trend of agencies working in silos at a time of a “generational squeeze” on public finances. The spokesperson said: “The introduction of the Think Family Education app means that schools … have access to appropriate information in a secure and restricted way to make decisions about how they support children. There are strict controls in place about who can access this information, how they do this and the reasons why.” A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset police said the database gave professionals working with children joined-up information to identify and safeguard those at risk of criminal and sexual exploitation. “The TFE app gives professionals immediate access to this information, helping them to act swiftly on any identified risks.” The spokesperson said neither the app or database assessed the likelihood of an individual to commit a crime. The force said “robust privacy and sharing agreements” had been approved by the Information Commissioner’s Office and development of the system done in collaboration with the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.

These collect fine-grained data about behaviour throughout the day and link it both to the child but also the people that are near that child. It operates all across the child&#x27;s school career. I&#x27;ve tried to opt my kids out of this but it&#x27;s really hard. At best I think they have stopped logging their behaviour but they are still in the data as a &#x27;network&#x27; influence. Classcharts used to boast about how their AI could do behavioural profiling but that looked too creepy so now they just talk about how teachers can use the data for seating planning. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I could use the data to profile a child pretty effectively even after they have left school. God only knows what happens to the data or how it is secured - the school literally don&#x27;t care and think I&#x27;m crazy for even asking. reply didntcheck 16 hours agoparentJust had a watch of their demo video. One of the seating plan sliders allows you to cluster pupils by free school meals (i.e. socioeconomic class) or EAL status. Such wonderful technology! reply kwhitefoot 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have children in school in the UK. There seems to be so much going on that has nothing to do with education.

Apathy because people are tired. And maybe apathy because it&#x27;s clearly being aimed at people for class and&#x2F;or ethnicity.

But I&#x27;m sure there are several companies currently working on a way to do this scoring automatically via commodity webcams facing the class reply merpnderp 20 hours agoprevThe title made it sound like the schools were installing malware on students&#x27; devices, but as far as I can tell this is just a central database bringing together data from different government agencies.I&#x27;m not sure I see the problem with schools getting an update that a kid was arrested by police or that their family is on food aid or something. Schools in my area need to know which kids are living in poverty because they send home backpacks of food with them over the summer. reply lolinder 19 hours agoparent> just a central database bringing together data from different government agenciesI realize this is a US perspective, but this actually sets off more alarm bells in my head than a school overreaching by installing spyware. The latter can be addressed by direct parental action pretty easily. Government agencies systematically sharing data is a lot harder to solve and if anything is more dangerous.Just because a family gets welfare aid from one agency doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that they want their kid&#x27;s school to know about it. Maybe they got enough and want their child to not have to feel different from the other kids by getting special treatment at school. Why not just let the family self-report their need to the school?More alarming is the idea of reporting interactions with police. A conviction is one thing, but an arrest could very easily be a mistake, and propagating that information explicitly in the name of child protection is a recipe for turning that mistake into a tragedy when a school overreacts. reply fatnoah 18 hours agorootparentSpeaking of red flags:>Staff using the app have told the criminal justice campaign charity Fair Trials that they keep it secret from parents and carers, and admitted many would be concerned about it if they knew of it.The other red flag is exactly zero examples of how using this data allowed anyone to \"safeguard\" at-risk youth or to \"act quickly\" to intervene.It&#x27;s profiling, plain and simple. Despite best intentions, it will definitely enable bias (unconscious or not) to be a factor in how children and their families&#x2F;caregivers are treated. reply oconnor663 19 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sympathetic to this, because my own politics are very libertarian. But recently I&#x27;ve gotten more sensitive to cases where we acknowledge that something is the government&#x27;s job (e.g. protecting kids from violence), but then we insist that that job should be done poorly. I think this has ripple effects, not only in that the job doesn&#x27;t get done well, but in the culture of how the government works and who chooses to work in government. It seems like there should be a middle ground where we don&#x27;t want the government to be responsible for too many things, but we do want it to be good at the things it&#x27;s responsible for. reply RHSeeger 17 hours agorootparent>But recently I&#x27;ve gotten more sensitive to cases where we acknowledge that something is the government&#x27;s job (e.g. protecting kids from violence), but then we insist that that job should be done poorly.We don&#x27;t insist they do the job poorly. Instead, we set things up so that they need to cover their own ... asses when they take action. Instead of making a rational decision on a per situation basis, we get things like \"0 tolerance\" rules; so that the authority figure can say \"I was just following the rules\". Because if they make a judgement call, SOMEONE will flip out and they&#x27;ll get fired. And that leads to all kinds of horrible outcomes- Child brings a plastic knife to school to cut their lunch with, they&#x27;re suspended because it&#x27;s a weapon- Child is attacked by a bully and is suspended, because they were involved in a fightAdding information gathering systems that will quickly wind up being abused, but have very little possibly positive value... doesn&#x27;t help with what&#x27;s currently wrong with the system. reply didntcheck 16 hours agorootparentYep. I wrote a longer comment elsewhere in this thread so I won&#x27;t repeat myself, but I think people attributing this to just surveillance obsession and nosiness are a little off the mark. If anything I would say the public have to share a fair bit of the blame here - there are constant demands that the public sector Do Something to Protect Our Children from abuse (independent of any statistics on frequency and whether the Something actually reduces it) which leads to an overzealous obsession with Safeguarding, and then teachers are trained to err on the side of oversuspicion, and know they may be raked over the coals if they fail to report when in doubt. So I&#x27;m afraid to say this is what a significant amount of the public demanded reply fnordpiglet 18 hours agorootparentprevSometimes we don’t use every possible tool for every problem, particularly when the mass externalities may be worse than the individual outcome.An extreme example is nuclear weapons. You can win any single battle with nuclear weapons. But the world will end. Probably better to slog through trenches, and do the job “poorly”.Labeling kids based of family situation will indelibly make their situations define them. Many kids living in dysfunction go to school as a refuge from their life. School administrators aren’t social workers, and aren’t in a position to provide psychological and social assistance to kids who need it. A lack of funding for those services doesn’t mean you offload the work to functionaries at the local school. Teachers aren’t trained in these areas either - their forte is education and no matter how much you liked your home room teacher, they weren’t trained in social intervention. But there’s another aspect, around that idea of escape - once you’ve labeled everyone according to their situation, when you walk in the room, you have to assume everyone knows. You can’t let your life at home disappear any more. And not everyone who has access to the information will use it in a caring unbiased way. Many people will see a kid who has various labels of dysfunction associated with them as broken, needing special education, judge outbursts or misbehavior more harshly than an unlabeled kid.Finally, the entire point outlined in the article was to use information about their situation to flag unknown problems. Just because someone is on social welfare or a family member has a mental health issue, or even a parent is in prison, doesn’t mean they’re being sexually abused or whatever. However by labeling them administrators are explicitly intended to use the label to assume a likelihood of previously unreported abuse.Many parents are accused falsely of abuse or neglect for normal childhood injuries. They go through the trials of the damned to get their kids back and fend off criminal charges, and criminal charges are indelible on your record and show up in background checks even if you’re found innocent.So - yes, mass surveillance would likely catch more criminals. But it will also criminalize everyone, and punish many that are innocent. It’s better to disarm and slog through the trenches - and maybe actually fund social workers rather than surveillance startups - than descend into this morass. reply giantg2 18 hours agorootparentprev\"but then we insist that that job should be done poorly.\"Where is that being insisted? Also, what is the bar for \"poorly\"? After all, were talking about the government, which does many things poorly despite massive budgets, extensive power, etc. reply pydry 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is the kind of thing where it might be ask for a panopticon where the parents can see precisely what kind of queries are run on their data, by whom and why, with a time limited ability to keep query data secret for police investigations and such.Fighting against this type of data sharing on principle will probably fail because there are some legitimate use cases to Keep the Children Safe for this type of data.It&#x27;ll be hard, however, to push back a request that all data access requests are logged with justifications because, after all it helps to Keep the Children Safe.You might also discover that the appetite for this data might wane entirely if they can&#x27;t access it without being monitored and without having to justify themselves. reply ndsipa_pomu 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m curious how well a GDPR challenge would fare. There&#x27;s specific exemptions around data gathering to detect fraud and to solve crimes, but this database has a lot more detail and the lack of consent from families is concerning. reply fnordpiglet 18 hours agorootparentArticle 6(1)(e) of the GDPR states that data processing is lawful if it is “necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;art-6-gdpr&#x2F;I assume they would argue public interest … “protect the children” is the blanket public interest clause that allows all sorts of evil behavior. reply Silhouette 18 hours agorootparentprevOne of the details mentioned in the article is that the ICO (the UK data protection regulator) has reportedly already given its blessing to what is going on here. That&#x27;s interesting because it suggests that either the nature of the system and any potential risks it brings are being overstated by its critics or the public service that explicitly exists to regulate such systems isn&#x27;t effectively limiting the power of the state where it should. Those are very different situations and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough objective information in the article to tell which is happening. reply candiodari 19 hours agorootparentprevBut social care agencies have a serious problem. They don&#x27;t take good care of kids, which leads to them having a very bad reputation, which leads to child abuse (and many other crimes) not getting reported. Why? Simple: kids are treated far worse \"in the system\" than at home, even in abuse situations.But if CPS doesn&#x27;t get kids reported, they don&#x27;t get money.They don&#x27;t want to fix this by taking better care of kids (“generational squeeze” on public finances, as the article puts it), so they must find other solutions. And the solutions they&#x27;re going with are simple: get everyone to report everything on kids, in a format that can be easily used in court.In 6 months, expect a message that a teacher got beaten up for, probably unknowingly, causing a kid to be forcibly placed into \"care\". reply ballenf 20 hours agoparentprevMaybe the real problem is that there exists a system design to allow querying a person&#x27;s family connections to police interactions. This isn&#x27;t even just convictions, but basically any accusations or investigations. The wording is kind of vague, but I think this framing is supported by the article.The existence of such a system just seems dystopian.Seems entirely reasonable that issues of domestic violence should be known to schools, but this goes way beyond that.It&#x27;s only a matter of time before more public institutions manufacture reasons to use the same system. Surely the NIH should know about your police interactions before treating you. reply pera 19 hours agorootparentThe council provides a data flow diagram showing the source of the data:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bristol.gov.uk&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;5972-insight-bris... reply bmsleight_ 15 hours agorootparentBloody hell - until I looked at the digram, I did no realise - this is pure profiling.

The fact that you can effectively be smeared by a state-managed record with often no right of appeal is disturbing. And this isn&#x27;t the only scenario.

Why go to the bother of sending the food out, when the kids are already there. Also, the parents&#x2F;carers may feel insulted if they are thought to be receiving \"charity\", so it&#x27;d be a better idea to allow the kids to obtain extra food without involving the rest of the family. reply notahacker 19 hours agorootparentThe kids aren&#x27;t already there during the summer. As the GP pointed out. reply ndsipa_pomu 19 hours agorootparentNeither are the teachers.

Such a database is also accessible to schools for obvious reasons.If you have the very HN-y opinion that being on a database is so bad it would be better if the kids stayed hungry that&#x27;s fine, but please at least make a token attempt to understand a system before dismissing it. reply ndsipa_pomu 18 hours agorootparent> If you have the very HN-y opinion that being on a database is so bad it would be better if the kids stayed hungry that&#x27;s fine, but please at least make a token attempt to understand a system before dismissing it.Quite the opposite - my view is that if someone is hungry, then they should be provided food as a basic function of human society. To be honest, I&#x27;ve never heard of this food delivery system from UK schools and I thought that the issue was mainly handled (poorly in my view) by having Food Banks for starving families.Can you point me to some information on this UK scheme please? reply notahacker 18 hours agorootparentThe food delivery system is, frankly a bit of a patchwork rather than a national scheme now: there was a national scheme introduced during the pandemic to supply vouchers to kids that would otherwise have received school meals during school closures, and packed lunches to self isolating kids, a lot of campaigns to extend that to regular school holidays spearheaded by the unlikely figure of a professional footballer, and now a patchwork of schemes run by many local authorities covering everything from community organised lunch clubs to vouchers to packed lunch deliveriesIf you want to argue it sounds like a mess and would be better as a broad social security scheme I&#x27;m not going to disagree (though limiting numbers on it does save governments money...), but either way, it&#x27;s going to need names and addresses on a database to make it work. reply ndsipa_pomu 17 hours agorootparentAh yes, Marcus Rashford.Not having kids myself, I didn&#x27;t realise that teachers were so involved in providing food.

In theory there&#x27;s a concept of \"Team Around The Child\" where the various agencies - school, social services, social housing, sometimes even police - can come together to help the child through the rough circumstances they&#x27;re in. In practice, the only one of those that isn&#x27;t entirely dysfunctional is the school, and so you&#x27;ll often find school headteachers or SENCOs basically acting as the sole champion of a kid from a troubled family. reply hef19898 17 hours agorootparentIf that is what it is, more power to teacher caring that much abozt their students. Not sure if covert data collection at scale helps those teachers so. reply SoftTalker 17 hours agoparentprev> Schools in my area need to know which kids are living in poverty because they send home backpacks of food with them over the summer.This is the sort of thing that sounds good at first but ends up with these big brother databases.Really, why is it the responsibility of the school to send home food with a child? Schools should teach. That&#x27;s it. If there is a need to send food to some family, there are agencies and charities that are specifically created and empowered to do that job.Using schools as conduits for all sorts of unrelated social services is why our schools are so fucked up. Instead of just being focused on teaching, they are now responsible for psychological services, food distribution to the needy, substance abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse intervention, mandatory reporting of any number of other concerns, all of which contributes to the need to monitor everything and centrally catalog and track as much information as you can about kids and their families.It was one thing when this kind of stuff might be a note in a file folder, but now it&#x27;s online, probably poorly secured, and will never be deleted. reply merpnderp 16 hours agorootparentMan I totally agree with you, but you have to understand how bad meth has made things. The schools used to send home coats and clothing too, but the parents would sell them.

And there&#x27;s the underlying assumption of \"if in doubt, raise it\", with the false belief that a false report is harmless and will surely come out in the wash with no harm from the process.Though it&#x27;s important to remember this isn&#x27;t down to the staff all being little Umbridges wanting to cause stress; as usual it&#x27;s down to incentives. They are explicitly told they could be at fault for failing to report a Potential Safeguarding Issue, so it&#x27;s the safer option in doubt. And at an organisational level, any instance where a child does come to harm leads to potentially nationwide accusations of negligence (sometimes fair) and demands to Do Something, no matter what that something is, what its collateral costs are, and if it even works in the first place.And of course it would be unfair not to mention that the teachers themselves are often very much victims of similar overscrutiny, and are quite used to self-policing their behavior, with fear of both policy violations and parents&#x27; ire. Again, I&#x27;m largely criticizing the policy not the people.

There is a lucrative industry providing what amounts to glue and regexs for detecting and reporting suicidal language, threats of violence, and so on (you can be sure there&#x27;s detection of LGBTQ language for all the various religious schools.)There is a subreddit for K-12 IT administrators and the stuff people would post there about monitoring students was pretty shocking (also, the levels of incompetence are also pretty shocking. Most of the crowd are barely competent at IT basics. People who are in charge of IT at multiple campuses.)Tell your kids that any email account associated with the school, and anything they even type into a school device (phone, tablet, laptop, computer) is monitored, and even the most innocent keyword could flag their email and put it front of admins. If they want to talk to a trusted friend about anything regarding the administrator or teachers, or something regarding mental health, sexuality, bullying, violence, etc - they need to do it on devices not associated with the school, with no school management software installed, on non-school accounts.In fact, they should probably never use their school accounts or devices for anything except strictly school related communication and work.It&#x27;s amazing how completely ignorant these admins are that, say, hauling a suicidal student into a meeting with administrators is just about the last fucking thing that kid needs, and yet that&#x27;s exactly what was described in some posts and discussions. The only thing they care about is snooping in student&#x27;s activity and covering the school&#x27;s ass. reply fnordpiglet 18 hours agorootparentSadly a lot of kids only have one portal to the internet and that’s through a school device.Otherwise the advice should be, as you said, to never use a school device for anything not explicitly required by the school. But when there’s no other route, surveilled access is better than none, I guess?It’s a tough quandary though - schools can be held liable, at least socially so if not legally, if kids use school provided devices for all the things kids use devices for that they shouldn’t. Meeting sexual predators, bullying, etc. Many parents are technically incapable of monitoring their online activity, others too busy. Schools are being put in a weird spot of being access providers to an adult world online, not just educators.I’ll wager a lot of school surveillance started with parents demanding it.It’s a tough subject, I don’t have the answer. My intuition tells me schools shouldn’t be involved in access OR monitoring, but I also understand the “digital divide” isn’t just a media term. A lot of pretty smart kids live in a pretty neglected context, and without access to sources of fact like Wikipedia or sources of dubious plagiarism like ChatGPT (tongue in cheek), they’re at a structural disadvantage that can’t be overcome through hard work alone. reply SoftTalker 17 hours agorootparentOr they could just use paper and books and avoid the whole morass.There is zero need to be using \"devices\" in schools at least until High School, and I&#x27;d question even then. reply fnordpiglet 16 hours agorootparentExcept they can’t control the fact that wealthier kids will have access to devices that give them Wikipedia and ChatGPT and other online knowledge sources. Being able to tell ChatGPT “explain to me the Byzantine empires history” then interrogate it on fine points to prep to write an essay in immeasurably more powerful than “here’s a middle school textbook good luck understanding the nuances.” This puts the kids without a device at a structural disadvantage, a more steep disadvantage than they’re already at in society.Finally, there’s an idea of digital literacy - the ability to use these tools to your advantage, and to navigate with sophistication the mental crack of algorithmic personalization. They will have a device at some point, and being taught at a younger age to be skeptical of mental crack might help weaken its hold (still to be seen!) reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentWealthier kids have always had and always will have advantages like that.

American obsession with Ring-like cloud connected cameras and their dealings with police forces are way more dystopian than the reality of CCTV as practiced in Britain.A good example is my partner getting pickpocketed on an empty tube train, which surely should make finding the person easy, right? Nope, the Met told me they&#x27;d need to go and pay the train maintenance company to retrieve the recordings from each carriage on the train, and they&#x27;re not going to do that over a wallet.In practice it works pretty well, because it implicitly sets a very high bar on the severity of the crime that would warrant retrieving dozens of recordings and tracing people through them.

What concerns me is the apparent indiscriminate use of the data by teachers who are typically not the most privacy focussed people. The predatory teacher example is an outlier, but it demonstrates how there can be unintended consequences. What&#x27;s more likely is that there will be unconscious bias by the teachers against the disadvantaged children from poorer backgrounds.To my mind, teachers should only function as a backup social service for those kids that slip through the net (admittedly, not a good net) and should be focussed primarily on education. What set my alarm bells ringing is the lack of openness about the database and whether families can correct false records (assuming they even know that the data exists). reply notahacker 17 hours agorootparentBut the \"apparent indiscriminate use\" is all in your head (I&#x27;m glad you have an ordinary human head ;), and if teachers were contacting the safeguarding lead to try to establish who has criminal parents that wouldn&#x27;t exactly be an unconscious bias anyway!

One said: “They [parents and carers] wouldn’t know about this ... parents will have no kind of sight of it at all ...

The lack of notification to the families is of concern although there&#x27;s certainly scenarios where you specifically don&#x27;t want them to be notified.My biggest worry is further widening the gap between the rich and the poor and between different ethnic groups.

They look for any excuse to arrest and prosecute people in those neighborhoods. Once you have a felony conviction on your record, you&#x27;re basically unemployable for 10 years (in the US at least). Thus continuing the cycle of poverty. And of course, minorities tend to be disproportionately poor.This makes that cycle worse.

If this were true it would represent a criminal opportunity to victimize \"wealthier neighborhoods.\" As far as I can tell: that does not seem to be the case very often; and victimization rates are higher in \"poor neighborhoods.\"I can see the logic of an argument that excessive legal criminalization induces cycles of harmful involvement in law enforcement and legal systems. However, using the language \"policed far more heavily\" as opposed to \"criminalized far more heavily\" places the blame on a convenient-to-scapegoat blue-collar occupation rather than directly upon the powerful people who compose the ever-expanding encyclopedia of laws and regulations. reply RajT88 18 hours agorootparentPolice already have discretion to enforce the law on whomever, and however they wish.

Is the claim that differences in policing are due to discretion in law enforcement and not because victimization rates are different in neighborhoods of different socio-economic statuses?Discretion in enforcement is either lawful or not. If discretion is the key problem and lawmakers do not address it, then yes, the responsibility is on lawmakers and ultimately on voters. reply RajT88 11 hours agorootparentDiscretion is not the key problem.

In the item \"37598636\" [0] at issue is Poor neighborhoods are policed far more heavily than wealthier neighborhoods. but here at 37605421 [1] the issue is how not how much policing is performed. Maybe the claim is better stated as \"poor neighborhoods poorly policed stay poor.\"Additionally, the americanactionforum.org link does not support the claim \"Most \"bad guys\" sent to prison are not violent offenders (drugs, theft, homelessness, child support, etc.) with drug possession being a huge chunk of it.\"The link is somewhat inconsistent. It claims \"The United States currently incarcerates 2.2 million people, nearly half of whom are non-violent drug offenders\" and \"Of the 2.2 million currently being held in the U.S. criminal justice system, nearly 500,000 people are being held for drug offenses.\" .5M is about a quarter of 2.2M.Looking at one of the cited sources [2, Table 13], the latest data is 2019 and states that a slim majority of prisoners are in prison for violent crime. Given that the ojp.gov survey does not include pre-trial jail, maybe % nonviolent drug offenders is different from the below data, but my null hypothesis is that the proportions would remain largely similar.

China has a social score system. reply ndsipa_pomu 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m still waiting for him to be tried as a war criminal reply rob137 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ll just throw in that I volunteer for an organisation that often deals with children, and in many ways safeguarding has been a disaster. I can totally see how good intentions following the &#x27;Baby P&#x27;* case led to laws like this. But the reaction from many organisations has been to completely reorient themselves, and at all costs.This is quite natural given that ultimately the law poses the greatest threat to the leaders of charities, schools etc. You really don&#x27;t want a high profile failure on your watch.When I was trained to lead shifts of volunteers, it stood out to me that the only instruction I received was in safeguarding...My first thought was that something simply isn&#x27;t quite right, since safeguarding is far newer than the organisation itself.But actually I think this is just the way of things. If you have enormous punishments, then you will have commensurate reactions from management.We&#x27;ve lost a large number of volunteers because we can no longer guarantee anonymity to young people. Initially we were reassured that we would only be expected to report things when identifying information was willingly given to us. This has since been revised to instructions that we are to actively seek such information.The law itself was brought in following high profile instances of horrific abuse that went overlooked by social services. However, the scope of the law is surprisingly wide.For instance, this would all apply to a 17-year-old who mentions that they were being bullied by peers.I myself do feel conflicted - abuse is terrible, and it&#x27;s worth tolerating other kinds of indirect harm to prevent. But it&#x27;s still shocking to me that the second order consequences don&#x27;t appear to get discussed at all in the public sphere. I do worry that this has been snuck in as a \"Save The Puppies Act\" without proper deliberation.I&#x27;m unsure if there are other countries who have pretty much identical laws, or if it is just the UK?* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Killing_of_Peter_Connelly reply joncrocks 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just the UK.I think the issue is that it&#x27;s very hard to have open discussions about accepting that certain events are unavoidable and preferable to the second order impacts of trying to &#x27;solve the problem&#x27;.It&#x27;s hard to talk about at least in part that &#x27;the problem&#x27; in these situations tends to be a terrible event that can be avoided, but only avoided by doing lots of lots of &#x27;ever so slightly terrible&#x27; things. And so it takes a toll on the soul to look at the balance and say that we should live with &#x27;the problem&#x27;. reply rob137 17 hours agorootparentYes, this captures my feeling too. It feels like an evil problem. It&#x27;s not just misaligned incentives, though they do play a role.I would love to find a name for this type of dynamic. I don&#x27;t have words for the issue, and feel like I could communicate it more easily to others if I did. reply didntcheck 15 hours agorootparentTo combine some metaphors - is it basically shooting the messenger who tells you that the cure is worse than the disease? reply tempaway22641 18 hours agorootparentprevYes I&#x27;ve seen the same thing. As you say, lots of orgs have had to reorient themselves around the safeguarding process reply rob137 18 hours agorootparentAnother example that just sprang to mind. A headteacher I know reported safeguarding concerns when he was made aware that a 7 year old was walking to primary school alone. I suppose partly to do with leaving a paper trail in case the worst should happen - but the system then does kick in all the same. It&#x27;s the same law that was originally designed to deal with far more serious incidents. (You could argue that this case wouldn&#x27;t even qualify in many peoples&#x27; minds, but it&#x27;s also not obvious to me that the headteacher was being irrational, given the law.) reply tempaway22641 19 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s the description of the system from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bristol.gov.uk&#x2F;residents&#x2F;social-care-and-health&#x2F;...Think Family Database (TFD)---------------------------The Think Family Database (TFD) supports and connects safeguarding professionals from Bristol City Council and other public sector organisations.The data collected by Insight Bristol is securely held in the TFD, and includes information from approximately 50,000 families across Bristol.The TFD pulls together data from several public sector sources including:-Bristol City Council (Children Social care, Early Help, Education)-Avon and Somerset Police-Department for Education-Department for Work and Pensions-South West Commissioning Support Unit (SWCSU)The data from these organisations displays vulnerabilities or needs. It gives practitioners working with families an understanding of:-the family&#x27;s immediate need-which services the need comes fromThe practitioner can contact the relevant service. This helps the practitioner better support the family because:-the practitioner can discuss the family&#x27;s immediate issues with the agencies involved-the family does not have to repeat the same storyThis embedded approach helps practitioners coordinate support for families who are most in need. Sometimes those families are obvious but often they are hidden. The TFD highlights the hidden issues.Using targeted analytics, the system also helps identify children at risk of:-sexual exploitation-criminal exploitation-not being in education, employment, or trainingThis information supplements the wider council Think Family approach.These models do not replace professional judgement or decision-making. They guide and supplement the work of professionals and provide information about children at risk that professionals may not easily see. This early identification means that support and interventions can be put in place to stop problems turning into crises. reply tempaway22641 18 hours agorootparentAnd here&#x27;s a uk government report about the data sharing mechanisms for the app https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;... reply Silhouette 18 hours agoparentprevIf you&#x27;re going to hold government services such as social services or teachers responsible for childrens safety then this sort of thing is needed. And if you think thats not the job of the state then fair enough thats your opinion but in the UK the status quo is that it is the job of the state to look after vulnerable children&#x2F;people.This is the heart of the problem. When you start trying to turn people like teachers and doctors into something other than teachers and doctors you risk breaking the essential trust between parents and the professionals who have a role in their children&#x27;s lives. That is a dangerous path to follow. Obviously no-one wants to see any child suffering abuse or neglect and obviously as a last resort the authorities might have to intervene to protect a vulnerable child from harm. But there are other dangers with measures like this that are easily overlooked in our culture today and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s healthy. reply Doctor_Fegg 18 hours agorootparentUnfortunately 13 years of Conservative Party government means that there&#x27;s no-one left, apart from the teachers, to do the \"something other\". Phone up your local UK health trust and ask what the waiting time is for a CAMHS referral (Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service). Here&#x27;s the first one I googled: 30 months. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk&#x2F;camhs&#x2F;oxon&#x2F;ndc&#x2F;assessment&#x2F; reply Silhouette 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s easy to blame the incumbent government - and maybe in that respect there is some justification for doing so - but I doubt the deeper issues here are really about party politics. The previous Labour era was also increasingly authoritarian and Starmer, despite his history as a defence lawyer with an interest in human rights cases, has so far shown little willingness to roll back these kinds of measures. I find that remarkable given the number of large and potentially very harmful data breaches there have been this year alone from police services and other government offices including those with responsibilities for sensitive child protection matters but perhaps it is a sign of the times.I do worry that our society has just resigned itself to the fact that these intrusions will happen and every now and then someone will suffer very badly as a result but \"it would never happen to me\". I find that ironic when the original subject was child protection where the main concern is situations that are relatively rare but can be very harmful for the child when they do happen. reply Doctor_Fegg 17 hours agorootparentCertainly experience here in Oxfordshire (my wife has been safeguarding lead at her last two schools) is that the dramatic increase in CAMHS and EHCP referral times is entirely during the Conservatives&#x27; spell in power - and the consequent underfunding of local government. It could just be a local issue, and Oxfordshire have certainly been doing badly, but reporting suggests it&#x27;s widespread. But like you I have no confidence that Starmer will make things better. reply Silhouette 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t doubt you about the situation in Oxfordshire. I suppose I&#x27;m suggesting that these measures are symptoms of a wider malaise that has developed in our society over a longer period, where \"personal responsibility\" are somehow dirty words and everything has to be someone else&#x27;s fault now.That leads to unrealistic expectations that the government will somehow solve all problems. That in turn creates a political culture dominated by fear and CYA with an unhealthy side order of paranoia and everything conceivable being monitored&#x2F;measured.I don&#x27;t know for sure what caused this. I suspect a product of several factors including 24&#x2F;7 news, near-universal access to online systems and particularly social media, and a few high profile events like 9&#x2F;11 where governments responded very badly and effectively encouraged a culture of fear. It&#x27;s definitely something about our culture that has changed very clearly within my adult lifetime though. The idea of having principles and understanding why they matter feels very old-fashioned today. And again I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s healthy for our society at all. replyndsipa_pomu 20 hours agoprevWhy would they keep it secret from the families and children unless it&#x27;s doing something nefarious? reply ben_w 20 hours agoparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bristol.gov.uk&#x2F;residents&#x2F;social-care-and-health&#x2F;...They&#x27;re not keeping it secret.

Even the article is unable to say exactly what information the app has, and who has access to it—they mention safeguarding leads being the users, but then talk about how \"schools\" get notified when a student has an encounter with the police. Does this information get sent only to qualified professionals with clear accountability, or does it get sent to a shared email address that the administrators&#x27; receptionist reads?The secretive approach to this is unsettling, because it implies they know they&#x27;re doing something they&#x27;d get in trouble for. It sounds like the administration&#x27;s response was \"well, this app was public, parents could have read up on it if they wanted\", which resembles the old better to ask forgiveness than permission tactic. Clearly, every part of this plan should have been proactively explained to parents beforehand. reply tempaway22641 18 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s no secrecy about it, the app, who has access to it and why is explained here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bristol.gov.uk&#x2F;residents&#x2F;social-care-and-health&#x2F;... reply karaterobot 18 hours agorootparentAs I said in the comment you replied to, it should have been proactive. What I see here is that there exists a single page of text somewhere on a government website, waiting for parents to find it if they search around.

If you know how the algorithm works, you can find ways to game it. That doesn&#x27;t make the practice acceptable, but I think it explains the approach.FWIW, the same secretive approach prevents anyone from knowing why their social media accounts were banned, or how changes to a website will affect their ranking in the search engines. Exposing the underlying algorithms creates an arms race that will lead to even bigger problems. reply doctorpangloss 18 hours agorootparentHmm, but you can deploy essentially infinite resources for free in arbitrage to exploiting an algorithmic quirk in social media distribution, search engine rankings, etc.What exactly is the comparable threat model here?

The system also gives schools access to sensitive personal details about families’ financial situations.Financial situations? That sounds like they&#x27;re monitoring what&#x27;s easy to monitor, even if defending against domestic violence was the original intention.That said, \"we joined up thinking\" is definitely a valid argument for much of what the UK is doing right now.For those not following UK news: a large number of schools had to be closed this month due to people finally started paying attention to the fact that reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete lasted 30 years but had been installed 50 years ago.Monitoring that would have been sensible… but they&#x27;d have needed joined-up thinking to have noticed the problem had started happening in the 90s.

In-person identity proofing allows federal agencies to securely verify registrant identities in-person to provide access to services when identity cannot be substantiated online. Feb 14, 2023•Knowledge Article Number 000008073 Customer Information In partnership with General Services Administration (GSA), USPS® provides in-person identity proofing (IPP) services for Login.gov registrants. Login.gov offers a single sign-on solution for multiple participating government agency websites. With a Login.gov account, registrants can access applications from multiple government websites using one username and password. Participating federal agencies use Login.gov to protect their users. When attempting to sign into a participating agency website, you will be prompted to sign in or create an account with Login.gov before you can access your profile with the agency. Some government agency applications require you to verify your identity. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you – and not someone pretending to be you. USPS provides In-Person Identity Proofing for those whose identities were unable to be verified successfully online. This service is provided to the public free of charge. How does it work? When a registrant attempts to create a Login.gov account and online identity proofing fails, the registrant will be given the option to have their identity verified in-person at a participating USPS retail location. If the option for in-person proofing (IPP) is selected, registrants are provided the following: An enrollment barcode via email from Login.gov Link that displays participating USPS in-person identity proofing locations In-person identity proofing can be completed at any participating USPS Retail location. No appointment is needed (walk-in appointments are accepted) No fee is collected from the registrant Registrants must present enrollment barcode provided by Login.gov Registrants must present original and non-expired identification Registrants will receive a confirmation email from \"Login.gov\" notifying if you have successfully passed the Login.gov IPP process. If you passed, you will be directed to complete your registration through Login.gov. If you did not pass, you will be directed to contact Login.gov for next steps.

An identity card issued by the government would lead to a slippery slope of something, not sure what. HN is fertile ground for such paranoia, so no doubt someone will explain exactly what will happen if all US residents received a free identification card.Anyway, they get around this by using their Social Security Numbers everywhere. All residents have one. They use this in a novel way, where it’s both a username and a password, that you share with every corporation who asks. You’re supposed to keep it very secret because people can open financial accounts in your name with this number. But not that secret. Your utility company may ask for it and won’t provide service without it.Since it’s both a username and password, it’s stored very securely. Except when it isn’t, breaches happen, and people have no recourse. It’s immutable, so they can’t do anything other than say “don’t process any credit checks for me” and hope that works.Anyway, that’s the short version of why Americans are terrified of being assigned an ID, actually have an ID (SSN), but can’t use that ID because it’s super secret, but then use it everywhere anyway because they have no choice. reply criddell 2 hours agorootparent> Both Republicans and Democrats have opposed a National ID system. President Reagan likened a 1981 proposal to the biblical “mark of the beast,” and President Clinton dismissed a similar plan because it smacked of Big Brother. A National ID would not only violate privacy by helping to consolidate data and facilitate tracking of individuals, it would bring government into the very center of our lives by serving as a government permission slip needed by everyone in order to work. As happened with Social Security cards decades ago, use of such ID cards would quickly spread and be used for other purposes – from travel to voting to gun ownership.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;broad-coalition-urges-pr... reply cookie_monsta 2 hours agorootparentprevNot the person you are replying to, but...

Better yet, let them be issued with a simple OAuth flow through sites like login.gov where people have already been verified.The current system is the worst of everything. It&#x27;s a convoluted process with geographically and culturally disconnected people doing verification for (primarily) businesses that don&#x27;t even need to be tied back to a natural person or beneficial owner. To top it off, it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for an individual or open source project.Microsoft also plays a huge role in propping up the currently broken system by trusting EV certificates more than personal certificates even though the identity of a natural person is far more valuable than the identity of a shell company that can easily be used by bad actors.In one way I dislike identity verification systems like this because I think it&#x27;s going to increasingly disadvantage people that are already less fortunate, but in another way I hope that it can be used to improve some of the terrible processes we have to endure when it comes to identity and trust. reply KennyBlanken 15 hours agorootparentThe reason cert and signing costs are expensive is to discourage random people from signing up for accounts they don&#x27;t need, or uploading useless apps.This sort of \"price people out of being annoying or doing things they don&#x27;t remotely need\" technique is extremely common in society.EV certs involve a pretty lengthy number of checks, by the way.

I think it should be more of an upgrade. For example, let me get a personal code signing certificate for $50 per year and then treat an organizational cert as an upgrade where I pay $500 to have my business name on the cert. I could even see a case for having $5000+ high value certificates.The problem with that is the way companies like Microsoft handle them. Instead of telling the user \"this is a low value cert\", they put up a massive warning telling the user their computer is going to melt down if they trust it. It makes the decision of whether or not to run something binary and it&#x27;s not.I think a system where I could sign things as trivial as PowerShell scripts would be better than what we have now. Anyone I give something like that to is going to know me personally and can easily judge the trustworthiness of what they&#x27;re running by seeing my name.> This sort of \"price people out of being annoying or doing things they don&#x27;t remotely need\" technique is extremely common in society.From what I see, it makes things difficult for someone trying to provide fair value and favors anyone willing to price gouge their customers.

Having a PO box isn&#x27;t enough.And, based on my experience, it&#x27;s all a big clown show. The people doing the verification are at a huge informational disadvantage because (I&#x27;m assuming) they&#x27;re in a processing somewhere with minimal training and are expected to verify identities for every jurisdiction in the world. It&#x27;s like me trying to verify the identity of someone in China. No matter how much training you give me, I&#x27;m probably never going to be as good at it as a local would be.The whole system could be better. I would prefer to see something where everything starts with a personal code signing certificate for a natural person and where getting an EV certificate requires an attestation from someone with a personal certificate. My identity is more valuable than a shell company.There&#x27;s no incentive for anyone to fix it either. The platform owners benefit immensely if people abandon a standardized code signing system in favor of the signing certificates they issue for their app stores.

The envelope might be scanned at the originating point, and the image sent to a human for review, or the letter might make it to a post office at&#x2F;near the destination, and a human will take it.Sticking with the \"rd\" &#x2F; \"road\" example: When the bank goes to mail something to you, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they run the address through a validation program. That validation program would catch things like \"rd\", replace it with the appropriate term, and also generate the Zip+4 code. What&#x27;s missing is feedback from that program.

And no, \"phone number verification\" (that really only works for phone numbers with the big three mobile carriers) should also never have been a thing.I really, really hope to see a usable-by-everyone identification method one day, as opposed to \"usable by enough\", with a sizable fraction of the population just being denied access to credit, banking, and more, just because they don&#x27;t exist in the expected form in some creepy data miner&#x27;s database.Ironically, German ID cards support exactly such a method: You can just tap it on your iOS or Android phone for a \"qualified electronic signature\" as defined by EU law.

The video replacement has the same flaw. You are legally entitled to a bank account, but a large portion of immigrants are left out.Many banks now require a plastic residence permit. In Berlin it takes a few months to arrive. How do you pay your rent while you wait?The residence permit is an eID, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who activated it. You get an activation code weeks before the permit arrives, but it doesn&#x27;t explain why it&#x27;s useful and the activation requires an in-person visit somewhere. So I&#x27;m told; I have not activated mine.Soon they want to use the eID for the address registration. This would save everyone an in-person appointment... except immigrants who must register long before they get a residence permit.Fortunately, there are old Germans who must also be accounted for, so old-fashioned bureaucratic services exist in parallel.France allegedly has a good method: the postal worker knocks at your door and verifies your identity. reply hef19898 3 hours agorootparentHow do ypu pay your rent?

If I ever again need to prove my identity to them proving that I receive email at that address is good enough.For the site that provides my email address they need something other than email to identify me.If I&#x27;m using an email provider that lets you bring your own domain, they could use proof that I control the DNS for that domain as proof of identity.How to prove identity to my domain registrar? I could use an email address that is not hosted somewhere that depends on my proof of domain ownership, like gmail or my ISP, but that is probably not a good idea. Ultimately, my ability to prove my identity at most sites would depend on proving identity to my domain registrar (or to my email host if I don&#x27;t have my own domain), and so making that depend on remaining in good standing with Google might not be wise.What we need for proving identity to a domain register (or an email provider if you don&#x27;t have your own domain) is something that we can be sure we can rely on, because in the worst case when you&#x27;ve been massively hacked and your identity has been stolen at multiple sites and services that is going to be the identity proof you count on to let you recover everything else.For that something like the USPS identity service would be great. reply nlawalker 5 hours agoprevSomewhat related: you can request your US federal-level rap sheet (“Identity History Summary”) from the FBI for a small fee, commonly done as part of an application process for a long-term visa abroad.

Since 2021, the SEC has prosecuted funds that bill themselves as investing exclusively in securities that rank highly in environmental, social, and governance measurements but which rather cast a much wider net with their investments. “It is truth in advertising,” Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, said. The move was largely welcomed by activists and environmentalists, including some who had long considered the lax restrictions deceptive or even predatory of retail investors. “These rules will help cut down on greenwashing and misleading marketing so that millions of U.S. investors ensure … their money is being invested in line with their interests and their values,” a strategist at the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy organization, said. “The SEC’s action today is a vital step,” the Environmental Defense Fund wrote. Despite a market downturn in 2022 — during which traditional funds suffered billions of dollars in outflows — investors continued to flock to ESG funds, pushing their assets under management to a record $2.8 trillion last year. Demand has been driven largely by Europe• 1 , which accounted for 89% of sustainable funds’ assets. After years of out-performing traditional funds, however, sustainable funds’ returns fell below those of traditional ones last year, according to Morgan Stanley research. 1 Morgan Stanley, Despite Market Challenges, Demand for Sustainable Funds Remains Strong The EU is also cracking down on greenwashing. From 2026, products that can’t back up the accuracy of products marketed as being “climate neutral,” “eco,” or other sweeping environmental claims will be banned. The new rule, which climate NGOs have long agitated for, will make the EU the toughest region in the world in terms of green claims made to the public, the Financial Times reported. “Carbon neutral claims are greenwashing • 2 ,” the head of a European consumer association said. “The truth is that these claims are scientifically incorrect and should never be used.” 2 Financial Times, EU to ban ‘climate neutral’ claims by 2026 Will Rupert Murdoch’s media empire change with his son in charge?

Indian journalist Rahul Kanwal described the move as a \"diplomatic ballistic missile,\" saying the Modi government has gone on \"all out attack mode against Canada.\"• 1 The decision goes beyond the previous tit-for-tat of expelling diplomats, because it will affect any Canadian who wants to visit India and doesn't already have a visa.

Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that the agreement is a crucial part of his talks with the U.S. regarding Israel — as such a deal would help Riyadh defend itself against possible attacks from Iran.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Wednesday that his country, one of Ukraine's strongest allies, would halt the transfer of weapons to Kyiv. On Thursday, the Polish government sought to walk back the remarks, saying that it would carry out pre-agreed shipments. Morawiecki's Wednesday comments followed a broader dispute over shipments of Ukrainian grain. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces last year shuttered marine export routes and sent shipments overground through the European Union. Concerns mounted amongst local farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia that Ukrainian grain was driving down their prices, and the EU implemented an import ban to mitigate. While the bloc has not renewed the ban, Warsaw, Budapest, and Bratislava have kept it in place, angering Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the continued ban, saying that European allies were engaging \"in a political theatre — making a thriller from grain.\"• 1 1 BBC, Poland no longer supplying weapons to Ukraine as grain row escalates Warsaw has likely kept the export ban in place over concerns that Morawiecki's Law and Justice (PiS) party is facing a tough reelection campaign next month. Polish farmers staged protests against Ukrainian grain this summer, and the government fears further unrest ahead of what is likely to be a pivotal election.• 2 2 Deutsche Welle, Ukrainian grain: Why are eastern EU members banning imports? On social media platform X, international relations analyst Daniel Hegedus wrote that one \"can see here how the short-sighted and short-term political interests of a radical-right party in power trumped Polish foreign policy culture and strategic thinking. And also how autocrats in power prioritize regime interest over national interest.\" He added that \"mitigating the damage done will be a tantamount task even for a new, democratic Polish government.\"• 3 3 X, Daniel Hegedus AD Newsletters Events YouTube Twitter Facebook About Careers Privacy © 2023 Semafor Inc.",

As I understand it he argues that because an old forest breakeven point for carbon offsets is 50$ &#x2F; tonne the thought that offsets at 20 $&#x2F;tonne isn&#x27;t actually protecting the forest equates to that forest being already protected and thus there being no additional value for the offsets. reply whimsicalism 14 hours agorootparente: Oh I see, you were talking about the California article I linked, which is by a different author. That said, I think the section you are discussing is just about potential flaws in the causal model and why they think it is unlikely, not their primary reasoning.Maybe a different article, the one I am talking about conducted a causal estimate of the carbon averted using synthetic controls, not at all the argument that you are stating [0].Again, all of this debate would be easy to end with a controlled trial that non-profits like Verra will never do because of what they would reveal.Do you work in this industry?

And recurring as long as activity is ongoing.Activity that stores carbon: receive money. But only after the carbon is stored. Not for paper projects based on future estimates.Preferably applied at the source (like, where oil is pumped, or land use changes) since that&#x27;s easiest to audit. reply dredmorbius 16 hours agoparentprevThe problem with any of these measures is leakiness, particularly in light of global fuels trade, emissions, and global warming impacts.I somewhat agree that taxing fossil fuels directly is the most direct route, though that faces a number of challenges:- There&#x27;s no one single global tax authority. Several of the largest fossil fuel extractors (China, India, Indonesia, for coal, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, for oil, and Russia, Iran, Qatar, and China for natural gas) would tend to be noncompliant with such impositions.[1]- Outsourced manufacturing means that a secondary tax on imports of goods or services by carbon emissions would likely be necessary. I&#x27;m not sure how this would comport with existing trade treaties.- Taxes would hit low-income countries much harder than rich ones. This is one of the common sticking points for virtually all emissions- and limits-based interventions, and has been since the 1970s if not earlier.[2]- Any such taxes would have to be adjusted based on actual atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Not merely CO2 but other emissions as well. Effectively the goal is to set a net emissions and warming budget and adjust a tax scheme to achieve that.- Black markets would undoubtedly emerge, though the scale of such markets would make detection relatively straightforward. The more likely complication is that major actors (the US, China, Russia, India) are nuclear states, and direct interventions would entail their own risks.- As wealth is power[3], the passing, adoption, and enforcement of such a tax would likely be highly challenging.I don&#x27;t have much by way of alternative suggestions, but I do somewhat agree that a direct economic mechanism aimed at the source would be preferable.________________________________Notes:1.
