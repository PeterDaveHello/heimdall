My only complaint is this has a smoothing alpha edge on the pencil and line tools, which gives that unfortunate white outline when using the paint bucket. KidPix is great, but gimmie that classic Nearest Neighbour behaviour. reply yincrash 17 hours agoparenthttps://github.com/vikrum/kidpix/issues/16 It appears because the underlying HTML5 Canvas tools are being used, things like antialiasing are unavoidable without remaking certain API calls. I'm sure it could be done though! reply smusamashah 12 hours agorootparentI think that can be turned off. I tried that recently. There is a global flag we can set to turn of antialiasing.

The only way to actually get true aliased brushes in canvas is implementing a line drawing algorithm manually and drawing down aliased circles like how https://gifpaint.com/ & https://jspaint.app/ do it. reply smusamashah 8 hours agorootparentprevThis property is already applied if you inspect the canvas elements.

I was expecting a single line, but had more fun with it as it is, which is why I suspect it might not actually be a bug after all. reply djxfade 11 hours agorootparentprevIt's possible to avoid this issue. I implemented a Canvas based clone of the classic MS Paint back in the days. One of the tricks to avoid this, was to use decimal pixel coordinates, so instead of drawing a pixel at (100, 200), you would draw at (100.5, 200.5). reply recursive 1 hour agorootparentThat's not a complete solution. For instance, it assumes that each canvas pixel corresponds to a single logical pixel, and that each logical pixel corresponds to a single physical pixel. There are a number of reasons that might not be true. reply fergie 9 hours agoparentprevI think that the background colour for anti-aliasing is called \"matte\" in designer-speak. reply TechDebtDevin 17 hours agoparentprev..... reply jnaina 16 hours agoprevCraig Hickman was my Prof at UofO. Took his Digital Arts class in 1986 for one quarter and wrote an early proto color paint program inspired by MacPaint, on a Graphics Frame Store system that uses serial port to communicate with a Mac 128K. The system had basic graphics primitives built-in and the system drew the images based on the commands received. Forgot the name of said graphics frame store, which if I recall had 8-bit color and had \"Vector\" as part of it's name (though it uses raster CRT with bit maps and not vector displays).

From: Alan Kay Date: Mon, 12 Nov 2007 13:55:27 -0800 (PST) Subject: Re: Just curious ... To: Samuel Klein, Don Hopkins, Chris Trottier, John Gilmore Hi SJ -- Robot Odyssey is another game that would benefit from having a clean separation between the graphical/physical modeling simulation and the behavioral parts (both the games levels and the robot programming could be independently separated out) -- this would make a great target for those who would like to try their hand at game play and at robot behavioral programming systems. This is a long undropped shoe for me. When I was the CS at Atari in 82-84, it was one of our goals to make a number of the very best games into frameworks for end-user (especially children's) creativity. Alas, Atari had quite a down turn towards the end of 83 ... We did get \"the Aquarium\" idea from Ann Marion to morph into the Vivarium project at Apple ... And some of the results there helped with the later Etoys design. Cheers, Alan ---- From: Alan Kay Date: Mon, 12 Nov 2007 20:57:51 -0600 (CST) Subject: Re: Just curious ... To: Samuel Klein, Don Hopkins, Chris Trottier, John Gilmore Thanks SJ -- We are benefiting here from Don Hopkins' generosity (and of the original designers and owners of these games). The basic notion is that there are many games that, if modularized with nice separable interfaces, would be great environments for exploring various kinds of \"learning by doing\". For example, there is a nice separation between the \"rules/dynamics\" of a games world and the \"strategies/actions\" of the characters. There could be a third separation to break out the graphics and sound routines as a media environment. For example, in SimCity, the first and most useful breakout for children would be to allow various UIs to be made that would let children find out about and try experiments with the \"city dynamics rules\". It's not clear what the best forms for this would be, so it would be great to have a variety of different designers supply modules that would try to bridge the gaps to the child users. This could work even for pretty young children (we helped the Open Magnet School set up Doreen Nelson's \"City Building\" curriculum in the third grade of the school and this was very successful -- a child controlled SimCity would have been wonderful to have). Maybe this separation could be set up via the D-bus so that separate processes written in any language the authors choose could be used. This would open this game up to different experiments by different researchers to explore different kinds of UIs and strategy languages for various ages of children. I think this would be really cool! We would all learn a lot from this and the children would benefit greatly. A trickier deal would be the world dynamics (I'm just guessing here, but Don would know). This is one of the really great things about SimCity -- it can really accommodate lots of different changes and stitch things together to make a pretty decent simulation without too many seams showing. (Given the machines this game originally ran on, many of the heuristics are likely to be a little patchy. Don has indicated as much.) I think doing a great world dynamics engine for games like SimCity would be really wonderful -- and could even be a thesis project or two. Don has talked about doing the separations so that many new games can be made in addition to the variations. Similarly, Robot Odyssey (one of the best games concepts ever) was marred by choosing a way to program the robots where the complexity of programming grew much faster than the functionality that could be given to the robots. This game was way ahead of its time. Again, the idea would be do make a game in which environment, levels of challenge, and how the robots are programmed would be broken out into separate processes that a variety of gamers and researchers could do experiments in language and UI. One of the most wonderful possibilities about this venture is that it will bring together very fluent designers from many worlds of computing (more worlds than usually combine to make a game) in the service of the children. We should really try to pull this off! Cheers, Alan pjungwir on June 29, 2018rootparentDoes anyone here remember ZZT? I loved building puzzles in that game with the scripting language. You didn't program to play, but you could make your own games and program the behavior of special objects. It's the closest realized example I can think of to what Alan described here. jasonjayr on June 29, 2018rootparentI remember ZZT -- and the excitement when I found an archive of alternate worlds I could download from a BBS. Learning to program ZZT worlds was one of the first steps I took to programming. DonHopkins on June 29, 2018rootparentprevI'm not familiar with ZZT, but here's a reference to another game that inspired Alan Kay, called \"Thinkin' Things\", in a discussion about the Snap! visual programming language! https://snap.berkeley.edu ---- From: Alan Kay Date: Thu, 3 May 2018 07:49:16 +0000 (UTC) Subject: Re: Blocky + Micropolis = Blockropolis! ;) Yes, all of these \"blocks\" editors sprouted from the original one I designed for Etoys* more than 20 years ago now -- most of the followup was by way of Jens Moenig -- who did SNAP. You can see Etoys demoed on the OLPC in my 2007 TED talk. I'd advise coming up with a special kid's oriented language for your SimCity/Metropolis system and then render it in \"blocks\". Cheers Alan ------------- * Two precursors for DnD programming were in my grad student's -- Mike Travers -- MIT thesis (not quite the same idea), and in the \"Thinking Things\" parade programming system (again, just individual symbol blocks rather than expressions). ---- From: Don Hopkins Date: Fri, 4 May 2018 00:43:56 +0200 Subject: Re: Blocky + Micropolis = Blockropolis! ;) I love fondly remember and love Thinkin’ Things 1, but I never saw the subsequent versions! But there’s a great demo on youtube! https://youtu.be/gCFNUc10Vu8?t=24m58s That would be a great way to program SimCity builder “agents” like the bulldozer and road layer, as well as agents like PacMan who know how to follow roads and eat traffic! I am trying to get my head around Snap by playing around with it and watching Jens’s youtube videos, and it’s dawning on me that that it’s full blown undiluted Scheme with continuations and visual macros plus the best ideas of Squeak! The concept of putting a “ring” around blocks to make them a first class function, and being able to define your own custom blocks that take bodies of block code as parameters like real Lisp macros is brilliant! That is what I’ve been dreaming about and wondering how to do for so long! Looks like he nailed it! ;) Here’s something I found that you wrote about tile programming six years ago. -Don Squeak-dev: http://squeak-dev.squeakfoundation.narkive.com/7ZN0H3vt/etoy... Etoys, Alice and tile programming ajbn at cin.ufpe.br () 6 years ago Folks, I have been trying the new version of Alice . It also uses tile programming like Etoys. Just for curiosity, does anyone know the history of Tile Programming? TIA, Antonio Barros PhD Student Informatics Center Federal University of Pernambuco Brazil Alan Kay 6 years ago This particular strand starting with one of the projects I saw in the CDROM \"Thinking Things\" (I think it was the 3rd in the set). This project was basically about being able to march around a football field and the multiple marchers were controlled by a very simple tile based programming system. Also, a grad student from a number of years ago, Mike Travers, did a really excellent thesis at MIT about enduser programming of autonomous agents -- the system was called AGAR -- and many of these ideas were used in the Vivarium project at Apple 15 years ago. The thesis version of AGAR used DnD tiles to make programs in Mike's very powerful system. The etoys originated as a design I did to make a nice constructive environment for the internet -- the Disney Family.com site -- in which small projects could make by parents and kids working together. SqC made the etoys ideas work, and Kim Rose and teacher BJ Conn decided to see how they would work in a classroom. I thought the etoys lacked too many features to be really good in a classroom, but I was wrong. The small number of features and the ease of use turned out to be real virtues. We've been friends with Randy Pausch for a long time and have had a number of outstanding interns from his group at CMU over the years. For example, Jeff Pierce (now a prof at GaTech) did SqueakAlice working with Andreas Raab to tie it to Andreas' Balloon3D. Randy's group got interested in the etoys tile scripting and did a very nice variant (it's rather different from etoys, and maybe better).

OpenAI clearly has some talented people, but there's also a bunch of the typical \"TC optimization\" crowd in there these days.

TC is actually totally uncorrelated with the quality of talent you can hire, beyond some low number that pretty much any funded startup could pay.

Likewise, academic performance is evaluated differently than what you’d expect as a software engineer. Ultimately, everyone cares about scientific impact so academic compensation relies on name and recognition far more than money. Personally, I care about the performance of the researchers (i.e., their publications), the institution’s larger research program (and their resources), the institution’s commitment to my research (e.g., fellowships and tenure). I want to do science for my entire career so I prioritize longevity rather than a quick buck. I’ll add, the lack of compute resources was a far worse problem early in the deep learning research boom, but the market has adjusted and most researchers are able to be productive with existing compute infrastructure. reply eigenvalue 1 hour agorootparentBut wouldn't the focus on \"safety first\" sort of preclude them from giving their researchers the unfettered right to publish their work however and whenever they see fit? Isn't the idea to basically try to solve the problems in secret and only release things when they have high confidence in the safety properties? If I were a researcher, I think I'd care more about ensuring that I get credit for any important theoretical discoveries I make. This is something that LeCun is constantly stressing and I think people underestimate this drive.

It might get Ilya in the history books, and maybe some of the other high profile people he recruits early on, but a junior researcher/developer who makes a high impact contribution could easily get overlooked.

We have no idea what the fundamental architecture for superintelligence would even begin to look like. Not to mention the very real counter argument of “if it’s truly smarter than you it will always be one step ahead of you”. So you can think you have safety in place but you don’t. All of your indicators can show it’s safe. Every integration test can pass. But if you were to create a superintelligence with volition, you will truly never be able to control it, short of pulling the plug. Even more so, let’s say you do create a safe superintelligence. There isn’t going to be just one instance. Someone else will do the same, but make it either intentionally unsafe or incidentally through lack of controls.

If you've never worked on a farm and have some kind of romantic idea about it then you shouldn't do this. Farming is hard work. Modern farmers have college degrees, millions in equipment, and a vast amount of knowledge and experience you do not have. If you're thinking of doing this and do not have experience go work on a farm for a year before you buy in. reply miah_ 6 hours agoparentMaybe they have saved enough from working in tech that they can grow vegetables for themselves in a very low scale way. Its nice to escape from the career you've had for decades. Sometimes its not even an escape from the career, but the career and the city you've lived in. Moving to the forest and growing some vegetables and raising chickens isn't that difficult. You certainly don't need \"millions in equipment\". Its exactly what I did. I found it difficult to get a job in tech at the start of COVID after working in it for ~25 years. I moved to Michigan, and now live in the woods. My Cost of Living is a fraction of what it was. My mortgage is only 80% of what I was paying for rent in the SFBay area. Its peaceful and quiet here. It actually gets dark too. I no longer hear BART screeching on the rails at 2am or the constant flow of traffic. I.. do once again work in tech though at a much 'smaller' scale. My company is small and work demands don't dominate my life. I have balance. This year I've planted ~200 onions, ~100 potatoes, ~100 garlic, ~60 strawberry. I have blueberry from a few years back starting to flourish. I have wild blackberry, and mushrooms galore. \"touching grass\" is a daily activity as we manage our small flock of chickens. reply godzillabrennus 6 hours agorootparentThe woman who ran PR for Chicago Tribune did the same thing with her husband.

You don’t have to answer, but I’m guessing you’re probably not past 45. At some point, you start to prefer quiet.

And yes, maybe we’ll have a farm animal or two. reply selectodude 5 hours agorootparentI grew up all my life in a major city. The quiet and tranquility of a small town freak me out. For somebody who’s never lived in a city, you’re making quite a few assumptions. reply coldtea 5 hours agorootparentAs somebody who lives in a multi-million city, every second person I talk to wants to move to the country, and it definitely much stronger tendency after around 30-35+. It doesn't matter if the parent's assumptions are \"quite a few\" or don't match you, what matters is if they match a big segment of the population to be statistically useful. There are always outliers who love to grow old in a big city and have their ashes scaterred in the middle of Manhattan. reply ethbr1 4 hours agorootparentThe only set we should really be listening to are people who both: - Lived in a big city - Lived in a rural community Otherwise, everyone always thinks the grass is greener, absent experience with the alternative.

I hear it's quite popular in America. reply rickydroll 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, that's mostly me. I've lived in Massachusetts at multiple locations between Boston and Gardner. I'm now living at the edge of one of the mill cities. It is not far enough from traffic noise, but it is much better than any other place I've lived other than Massachusetts rural. I've also lived from the deeply blue-collar (father's small business moving machinery) to the tech world. I find myself marketing my consulting business to small to medium-sized blue-collar/manufacturing businesses. Even though their Trumpist attitudes irritate me, I understand their world better than I do that of urban-centric, and their political views do not stop me from taking their money. It makes it easier for me to charge them the rates that I do. I think the quip is a good one. However, I feel it could be better phrased as, \"You need to seek out the best bits to remind you why you tolerate the worst bits.\" When I'm having a bad day, and I wonder why I'm putting up the crap in my life, I walk into my yard, look at my garden with cucumbers, beans, cauliflower, and something like 20 tomato plants next to raspberries, blueberries, sour cherry tree, and Apple tree. And if it's a really really bad day, I will go and settle into the hammock and stare at the sky. When I can finally feel gratitude for the life I have, then I go back and deal with the crap that lets me afford the life I have. reply asveikau 46 minutes agorootparentprev> every second person I talk to wants to move to the country Doesn't that possibly reflect your social circle more than a statement about the public at large? reply fullstop 4 hours agorootparentprev>At some point, you start to prefer quiet. > I haven’t lived in a really large city, but have been around noise enough that I’m hoping our next move will distance us from neighbors and highway noise. I feel this, and I'm mid 40s. I keep my eyes open for places to live which are somehow both remote and near decent healthcare options. I don't need the healthcare options now, but I am aware that I am only going to get older and that's something that I'd want. I do my best to keep my yard full of life and tend to my plants and my gardens, but there's always the noise from the highway a mile or so away. It's less annoying when it's hot out, but the drone bothers me in the winter months. reply insane_dreamer 4 hours agorootparentprevSame here. I lived in some of the world's largest cities most of my life, and loved the \"big city\" atmosphere. But in my late 40s it changed and started to crave being out in the countryside, away from people, noise, etc. I now live on the outskirts of a medium size city (in 5 minutes I'm out among orchards and vineyards), but would prefer to be even further out, have an orchard or small farm (though I have no illusions that I could make a living from that) reply ethbr1 3 hours agorootparentOne uncounted point is frequency of novelty. Generalizing, I'd say younger people (18-35) are more default-comfortable in novel situations. As we age, people's tolerance for that seems to decrease. And, on the whole, I'd say that rural life provides less novelty than city life. Or at least novelty within tighter bounds. reply insane_dreamer 1 hour agorootparentI still crave novelty, in that I'm always wanting to discover new things, go new places. But I don't feel the need to be so \"busy\" as is common in a big city. reply asveikau 4 hours agorootparentprevSome people do still like city life in their 40s.

It sounds like you have a peaceful life though reply miah_ 4 hours agorootparentI grew up here and left as soon as I turned 18! After living all over the US and trying out different cities and locales returning to Michigan made the most sense. Buying a home in the SFBay area isn't feasible unless you're willing to work multiple jobs or sell your soul to FAANG. Want a house? Get ready to replace: The foundation, the roof, the sewer lateral, oh and the addition wasn't done with a permit so its not to code at all. All for the low low price of $500k! On a lovely 1/4th acre plot, you'll be hearing your neighbor while they fart in the bathroom. What, you only got $500k? Don't worry, this other person here has $550k and they don't have a problem with the house need to be rebuilt! Oh I'm looking at $500k houses? I should be looking at 1.1mil houses to not deal with all those problems? Now I've got 1.1mil mortgage for 30 years. I don't want to work into my 70's for a house. Compared to... come to Michigan, you can get 5 acres for less than $300k and your house is functional, maybe it needs a new roof within 5 years. My mortgage is 15 years and will be paid off before that. I think \"competition\" is the big thing that drove me back home. I was tired of competing with my neighbors (people who live in the same city) for _everything_. I don't mind people, I loved meeting people in every city I lived. I just felt like I had to fight for every \"inch\" in most \"big cities\" (but especially SFBay area). It's very peaceful here. I love it. Maybe I'll go to the big lake (Michigan) later and swim. reply mdip 3 hours agorootparentMichigan's housing prices vary pretty dramatically and we don't have a terribly low cost of living in parts -- especially real-estate. It's no SFBay, but it's rapidly getting worse. You mentioned the 300,000 on 5 acres, and that's definitely possible, but you're not getting that in the desirable parts of Macomb or Oakland County[0], nor anywhere in Wayne outside of Detroit/Detroit-ish areas. I watched a house on a busy city road (one where \"pulling out of the driveway means an immediate traffic backup to the light\" between 7-9 and 4-6 every day) which was 2,200 sq ft, 4 BR 2.0 BA, though it was new construction (relatively modern/upgraded interior) go for $550,000 in 2022 after multiple bids. The home I own (1800/3BR/1.5BA) which I purchased for $175,000 in 2001 and would have lost money had I sold it between 2007~2018, is worth about $330,000. This is partly due to the value increasing due to local changes and \"what's happening everywhere in the country\" housing prices-wise. I know folks who moved to Plymouth to a home with similar specs but paid a quarter million in 2017. Cool. And because I didn't re-finance, I don't have a mortgage any longer. Except I want to upgrade. And had I done that in 2008, I could have afforded it. Now that upgrade is twice as much but my salary has not followed suit. My desire to upgrade went to near zero, already, once I paid it off. But now I couldn't even afford to if I wanted to. I figure I'll downgrade and move near the kids when they're older and take home some cash in the process. One thing I love about where I live in Michigan, though ... it's rare that a house doesn't have a basement. Even in places you wouldn't expect -- our next-door neighbor on Lake Huron had a full basement with 12ft ceilings (and a hell of a system to keep it bone dry). And newer homes tend to have excellent ones you can make useful -- if not always up-to-code -- living/lab spaces out of. SFBay hacks in their garage. We hack in our basements. [0] When people say they \"Live in Detroit\" that's probably where they live. Just like the Detroit Zoo. reply ethbr1 4 hours agorootparentprevAgreed that competition is one of my major annoyances with big cities. Once it gets big enough that \"good\" restaurants require a reservation any day of the week, and those reservations are difficult to get, I'm moving somewhere else. Why work to fight to win... what you can just enjoy somewhere else? reply fragmede 47 minutes agorootparentTo be a total snob about it, it's because the \"what\" is better in some places. If the best restaurant in town is a Cheesecake Factory or Olive Garden, and there are no reservations; hey, you do you. reply mdip 3 hours agorootparentprevI've lived here since I was born and I'd say I feel that way a lot of the time. There's a lot of downside: tight ties to autos (where I live) mean that a lot of employers -- even if \"technically\" they aren't automotive focused -- tend to have so many customers in that industry that \"when something goes wrong at GM, Ford or whatever Chrysler is called, everyone around here gets it.\" Best I've been able to do is work for employers out of state/country but I'm currently employed locally at a remote-only shop. The weather. I get it. Everyone uses the same \"5 minutes and it'll change\" joke, but we're unique here. I thought I read somewhere that we see fewer cloudless days than the Pacific Northwest, but I can't find a reference so I suspect that's false, but we spend, basically, December to April with few sunny days. We live in a place of extremes, as well. Ten below (Fahrenheit) in the coldest winter days, 99 degrees a couple of days ago. Had one day in July when I was in High School where it was 85 degrees in the morning and in about a 15-minute period of time dropped to 45 due to a Derecho[0] rolling through (which almost picked me up off the ground due to 75 MPH winds and sent a large Oak Tree through our master bedroom). We don't get Spring or Autumn, we get Winter, Summer, and a period of time where the two are at war and it may be Winter or Summer depending on what day/hour it is. A decade ago, I was in the ER on the first week of March. The hospital couldn't \"turn on the Air Conditioning\" at will, they had to switch over seasonally, so when we had an unexpected 85 degree day, that meant it was about 85 degrees in the ER. That was fun. It is a beautiful place if you get out of the more populated parts, but I work here and that's where I live. Still, nice that it's an hour drive to get to something that qualifies as \"Up North[1]\" [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho [1] A phrase that has little to do with direction around here ... mostly just means \"resort-ish small town, a lot of which survives due to summer 'Cabin Up North' folks.\" Ours is in Port Sanilac. But, really, Lake Orion and Walled Lake used to be \"Up North\" communities :) reply scruple 4 hours agorootparentprevI grew up in Ohio, and I did grow up on a farm for the first part of my life, and I worked like hell to get out of there and I'd never go back, but somehow a small farm in Michigan has become an idea in my brain, too. reply hammyhavoc 5 hours agorootparentprevEveryone else's grass is always greener it seems. reply cryptonector 4 hours agorootparentNot in west Texas I'll tell you that! reply pastaguy1 5 hours agorootparentprevFunny comment about it being dark in Michigan.

Depending on someone's financial situation and expectations, there are certainly other types. Taking up farming does not necessarily suggest that you're going to compete in the highly competitive world of agribusiness. I personally know a smaller-scale farmer who has a biodynamic farm and provides a high quality of life for his family. He has not invested millions in equipment to make this happen (not even close), but he certainly works hard. There's no debating that. reply 42lux 6 hours agoparentprevEvery time this topic comes up a rhyme of your comment bubbles to the top and speaking from my own experience growing up in a winery.

In farming, something is always broken or less than it should be. But there is literally not enough time in the day (or money) to fix and maintain everything perfectly. So you do the best you can. Similarly, in waterwork, the ocean beats the hell out of everything. Docks, boats, houses, machinery, etc. And so why fix that solid but beat-up dock, if there's a chance this year brings the hurricane that rips it away?

I think that everyone should own some land to feed himself in the event of economy fallout. reply silisili 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's how I read it. Farming doesn't have to mean planting thousands of acres of soybeans and corn and hundreds of head of cattle.

Plenty of stuff can be learned online these days. And you don't need a lot of equipment either, if it's just to take care of yourself or your family. Depending on your community, you might also be able to rent some equipment if you need it at times (my girlfriend rents some equipment, tractor or some such with a driver, to cut the rice, about 2 times a year, as do most people in our village).

Farmers can make a lot of money, or at least somebody does. A single family Saskatchewan dryland wheat farm is typically worth $10M in land and equipment so either the farmer makes enough money to pay the interest on a multi-million dollar bank loan or enough money so that continuing to farm is preferable to retiring and living on the interest. The problem is of course the variability due to weather and wild swings in commodity prices. A farm can produce a high six figure income one year and lose six figures the next. But as you noted, if you're not looking to pull six figures per year from your farm, then it does become quite a bit simpler. reply ifwinterco 4 hours agorootparentIn the UK with arable you can potentially make money (although probably not), and it isn't a crazy amount of work.

Only really busy time is a couple of weeks in the summer for harvest.

The book was life changing as it made learning English so much easier than the Chinese way at that time and it taught me a lot about the US. The book 3 devoted many chapters to a day in someone's life, one of which is A Day in the Life of a Farmer. At that time, the US was the beacon of the modern civilization to Chinese people, a superpower that was far ahead of everything we did. And despite that the work of a farmer was still tough. They still needed to get up at 4:00am or early to take care of their livestocks. They still had to take care of their crops before the sun fully rose. They still had to handle many issues about their land, their equipment, and their business. They still had to do tons of intense manual labor. Despite all the toughness, though, the chapter also conveyed the idea that farming can be gratifying and fulfilling. I certainly appreciate this kind of optimism and appreciation, and the life an American farmer has a lasting impression until this day. reply latentcall 5 hours agoparentprevFarm doesn’t always mean hundreds of acres and millions in loans.

Another raises pigs in a barn on half that. reply postexitus 4 hours agorootparentI didn't say you cannot run anything. As a side project, sure - 1 Acre is quite a piece of land. But it's impossible to rely on it as your only source of income (i.e. definition of being a farmer). Even in the wine example - let's say they make 2$/liter, that's $5k/acre/year. Pigs actually make very little profit on average, when you combine all the other costs associated with raising livestock.

A bartender is still a bartender if they only work weekends. An artist is still an artist if it's not their dayjob. A barber is still a barber if they have to work another job to make ends meet. No, you shouldn't delude yourself into thinking that farming an acre or two is going to replace the income of most 9 to 5 jobs, but at a time in history where we absolutely need to be working to preserve and promote small-scale farming, we shouldn't be gatekeeping people. reply postexitus 4 hours agorootparentok, fair enough - I agree that the definition of a job shouldn't be tied to the income generated from it. However the main argument presented above was that people shouldn't assume farming is easy and relaxing - and working on a 1 acre farm with no expectation of income is not the same as \"being a farmer to make a living\" which is 100x harder. reply cryptonector 3 hours agorootparentIt's not easy, but it is relaxing. When I'm with my bees I have no other cares in the world. The buzzing alone makes sure of that. If I slipped up, they could kill me, so there's also that.

In some ways it ties into the \"big fish in a small pond\" theory of life. People who take that sort of advice have easy, stable lives. I'll keep giving it. Likewise, most people probably shouldn't jump into farming unprepared. That said, life is short, and a year is a long time. If you can stomach the downside risk (losing every dime you poured into farming, having to work hard at it), by all means just jump in. There are vibrant communities willing to teach you everything you need to know, and you'll learn faster working on real problems you're personally experiencing than rote memorizing the tasks a seasoned master tells you to do.

The idea of turning what would normally be a massive operation out in the country into a self sustainable, climate controlled operation in an urban environment is fascinating to me.

A lot of actually viable commercial farms where I live are smaller than many hobby farms in the US, for a start.

Interesting side topic: did you know that while John Deere's top of the line combine is well over $1 million retail (and of course everyone else's models are similarly priced), that a model 42 combine from the 1960s will still go for under $1000 at auction, even as recently as last October, and is more than sufficient to harvest oh, probably even up to 50 acres over a few days? If one sells wheat or oats or whatever, there's no way to compete at market but if one only wants enough wheat to feed themselves for the coming year (and not have to buy seed again next), it's some absurdly small acreage.

The farmers I know in my family all struggled mightily because every year was about accumulating a little more capital so they could rent some more land or buy the next piece of equipment they needed to grow in a few years. The people who do it as a semi-retirement after a different career often come in with funds to buy land (as an investment) and have some working capital up front. When the goal is more about getting any positive number out of the farm to offset property taxes and you’re not running it like a business where squeezing every penny out of rented land with rented equipment is the only way to make it to next year, it’s a very different experience.

Sadly, most farms today are huge corporate operations, so perhaps that's what you're talking about, but out of the less than 25% of the remaining family-sized operations, most are not wealthy by any stretch. Perhaps that's what they're doing \"wrong\". I think one of the reasons you can't really be crooked as a farmer is because it's a small community and everyone knows everyone else.

What you can do Sharepics and Infographics Additional information and arguments Debunking Myths Alternatives Document pool Critical commentary and further reading The End of the Privacy of Digital Correspondence The EU Commission proposes to oblige providers to search all private chats, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content – generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). The result: Mass surveillance by means of fully automated real-time surveillance of messaging and chats and the end of privacy of digital correspondence. Other aspects of the proposal include ineffective network blocking, screening of personal cloud storage including private photos, mandatory age verification resulting in the end of anonymous communication, appstore censorship and excluding minors from the digital world. Chat control 2.0 on every smartphone On 11 May 2022 the European Commission presented a proposal which would make chat control searching mandatory for all e-mail and messenger providers and would even apply to so far securely end-to-end encrypted communication services. Prior to the proposal a public consultation had revealed that a majority of respondents, both citizens and stakeholders, opposed imposing an obligation to use chat control. Over 80% of respondents opposed its application to end-to-end encrypted communications. Currently a regulation is in place allowing providers to scan communications voluntarily (so-called “Chat Control 1.0”). So far only some unencrypted US communications services such as GMail, Facebook/Instagram Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, iCloud email and X-Box apply chat control voluntarily (more details here). As a result of the mandatory Chat Control 2.0 proposal, the Commission expects a 3.5-fold increase in scanning reports (by 354%). Parliament has positioned itself almost unanimously against indiscriminate chat control. With supporters and opponents of mandatory chat control irreconcilably opposed in the EU Council and no common position in sight, the EU Commission proposed a two-year extension of voluntary chat control 1.0 in November 2023 – see timeline and documents. A victim of child sexual abuse and Pirate MEP Patrick Breyer have filed lawsuits to stop the indiscriminate scanning by US big tech companies. Explainer video Talk at Chaos Computer Congress (29 December 2023): It’s not over yet The Chat Control 2.0 proposal This is what the current proposal actually entails: EU Commission’s Chat Control Proposal Consequences EU Parliament’s mandate EU Council’s draft mandate Envisaged are chat control, network blocking, mandatory age verification for messages and chats, age verification for app stores and exclusion of minors from installing many appsno chat control, optional network blocking, no mandatory age verification for messages and chats, no general exclusion of minors from installing many apps like Commission All services normally provided for remuneration (including ad-funded services) are in scope, without no threshold in size, number of users etc. Only non-commercial services that are not ad-funded, such as many open source software, are out of scope like Commission like Commission Providers established outside the EU will also be obliged to implement the Regulation See Article 33 of the proposal like Commission like Commission The communication services affected include telephony, e-mail, messenger, chats (also as part of games, on part of games, on dating portals, etc.), videoconferencing Texts, images, videos and speech (e.g. video meetings, voice messages, phone calls) would have to be scanned telephony excluded, no scanning of text messages, but scanning of e-mail, messenger, chat, videoconferencing services like Commission End-to-end encrypted messenger services are not excluded from the scope Providers of end-to-end encrypted communications services will have to scan messages on every smartphone (client-side scanning) and, in case of a hit, report the message to the police End-to-end encrypted messenger services are excluded from the scope like Commission Hosting services affected include web hosting, social media, video streaming services, file hosting and cloud services Even personal storage that is not being shared, such as Apple’s iCloud, will be subject to chat control like Commission like Commission Services that are likely to be used for illegal material or for child grooming are obliged to search the content of personal communication and stored data (chat control) without suspicion and indiscriminately Since presumably every service is also used for illegal purposes, all services will be obliged to deploy chat control Targeted scanning of specific individuals and groups reasonably suspicious of being linked to child sexual abuse material only like Commission The authority in the provider’s country of establishment is obliged to order the deployment of chat control There is no discretion in when and in what extent chat control is ordered like Commission like Commission Chat control involves automated searches for known CSEM images and videos, suspicious messages/files will be reported to the police According to the Swiss Federal Police, 80% of the reports they receive (usually based on the method of hashing) are criminally irrelevant. Similarly in Ireland only 20% of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”. like Commission like Commission Chat control also involves automated searches for unknown CSEM pictures and videos, suspicious messages/files will be reported to the police Machine searching for unknown abuse representations is an experimental procedure using machine learning (“artificial intelligence”). The algorithms are not accessible to the public and the scientific community, nor does the draft contain any disclosure requirement. The error rate is unknown and is not limited by the draft regulation. Presumably, these technologies result in massive amounts of false reports. The draft legislation allows providers to pass on automated hit reports to the police without humans checking them. like Commission initially no searches for unknown CSEM Chat control involves machine searches for possible child grooming, suspicious messages will be reported to the police Machine searching for potential child grooming is an experimental procedure using machine learning (“artificial intelligence”). The algorithms are not available to the public and the scientific community, nor does the draft contain a disclosure requirement. The error rate is unknown and is not limited by the draft regulation, presumably these technologies result in massive amounts of false reports. no searches for grooming no searches for grooming Communication services that can be misused for child grooming (thus all) must verify the age of their users In practice, age verification involves full user identification, meaning that anonymous communication via email, messenger, etc. will effectively be banned. Whistleblowers, human rights defenders and marginalised groups rely on the protection of anonymity. no mandatory age verification for users of communication services like Commission App stores must verify the age of their users and block children/young people under 17 from installing apps that can be misused for solicitation purposes All communication services such as messenger apps, dating apps or games can be misused for child grooming (according to surveys) and would be blocked for children/young people to use. Where an app requires consent in data processing, dominant app stores (Google, Apple) are to make a reasonable effort to ensure parental consent for users below 16 like Commission Internet access providers can be obliged to block access to prohibited and non-removable images and videos hosted outside the EU by means of network blocking (URL blocking) Network blocking is technically ineffective and easy to circumvent, and it results in the construction of a technical censorship infrastructure Internet access providers MAY be obliged to block access (discretion) like Commission Changes proposed by the European Parliament In November 2023, the European Parliament nearly unanimously adopted a negotiating mandate for the draft law. With the Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer, the most determined opponent of chat control sat at the negotiating table. The result: Parliament wants to pull the following fangs out of the EU Commission’s extreme draft: We want to safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and remove the plans for blanket chat control, which violate fundamental rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material. We want to safeguard trust in secure end-to-end encryption. We clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning, i.e. the installation of surveillance functionalities and security vulnerabilities in our smartphones. We want to guarantee the right to anonymous communication and remove mandatory age verification for users of communication services. Whistleblowers can thus continue to leak wrong-doings anonymously without having to show their identity card or face. Removing instead of blocking: Internet access blocking ist to be optional. Under no circumstances must legal content be collaterally blocked. We prevent the digital house arrest: We don’t want to oblige app stores to prevent young people under 16 from installing messenger apps, social networking and gaming apps ‘for their own protection’ as proposed. The General Data Protection Regulation is maintained. Parliament wants to protect young people and victims of abuse much more effectively than the EU Commission’s extreme proposal: Security by design: In order to protect young people from grooming, Parliament wants internet services and apps to be secure by design and default. It must be possible to block and report other users. Only at the request of the user should he or she be publicly addressable and see messages or pictures of other users. Users should be asked for confirmation before sending contact details or nude pictures. Potential perpetrators and victims should be warned where appropriate, for example if they try to search for abuse material using certain search words. Public chats at high risk of grooming are to be moderated. In order to clean the net of child sexual abuse material, Parliament wants the new EU Child Protection Centre to proactively search publicly accessible internet content automatically for known CSAM. This crawling could also be used in the darknet and is thus more effective than private surveillance measures by providers. Parliament wants to oblige providers who become aware of clearly illegal material to remove it – unlike in the EU Commission’s proposal. Law enforcement agencies who become aware of illegal material would be obliged to report it to the provider for removal. This is our reaction to the case of the darknet platform Boystown, where the worst abuse material was further disseminated for months with the knowledge of Europol. Beware: This is only the Parliament’s negotiating mandate, which usually only partially prevails. Most EU governments continue to support the original chat control proposal of the EU Commission without significant compromises. However, many other governments prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority). As soon as the EU governments have reached an agreement in Council, Parliament, Council and Commission will start the so-called trilogue negotiations on the final version of the regulation. Patrick Breyer or his potential successor Anja Hirschel from the Pirate Party will again sit at the negotiating table to fight against chat control. Position of EU governments in Council Most EU governments continue to support the original extreme proposal of the EU Commission without making any significant improvements. Several other governments, however, prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority), so that proposed Council positions have already failed twice. red: in favour (see also list of “like-minded group“), green: opposed, yellow: scrutinizing. source More videos on Chatcontrol are available in this playlist The negotiations: A timeline 2020: The European Commission proposed “temporary” legislation allowing for chat control The proposed “temporary” legislation allows the searching of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This allows the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process, in part using error-prone “artificial intelligence”. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed (usually automatically and without human verification) to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified. 6 July 2021: The European Parliament adopted the legislation allowing for chat control. The European Parliament voted in favour for the ePrivacy Derogation, which allows for voluntary chat control for messaging and email providers. As a result of this some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls. 9 May 2022: Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has filed a lawsuit against U.S. company Meta. According to the case-law of the European Court of Justice the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights and is prohibited (paragraph 177). Former judge of the European Court of Justice Prof. Dr. Ninon Colneric has extensively analysed the plans and concludes in a legal assessment that the EU legislative plans on chat control are not in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice and violate the fundamental rights of all EU citizens to respect for privacy, to data protection and to freedom of expression. On this basis the lawsuit was filed. 11 Mai 2022: The Commission presented a proposal to make chat control mandatory for service providers. On 11 May 2022 the EU Commission made a second legislative proposal, in which the EU Commission obliges all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology in the absence of any suspicion. However, a representative survey conducted in March 2021 clearly shows that a majority of Europeans oppose the use of chat control (Detailed poll results here). 8 May 2022: Meeting Council Law

Pereira Jadwiga WiśniewskaBUDG Niclas Herbst Nils Ušakovs Nils Torvalds Alexandra Geese Silvia Modig Bogdan Rzońca Joachim Kuhs How does this affect you? Messaging and chat control scanning: All of your chat conversations and emails will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically. If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, your private or intimate photos may be viewed by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe. Flirts and sexting may be read by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for “child grooming” frequently falsely flag intimate chats. You can falsely be reported and investigated for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, 80% of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. Similarly in Ireland only 20% of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”. Nearly 40% of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for “child pornography” target minors. On your next trip overseas, you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy – with incalculable results. Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails. The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages. This is only the beginning. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops? Age verification: You can no longer set up anonymous e-mail or messenger accounts or chat anonymously without needing to present an ID or your face, making you identifiable and risking data leaks. This inhibits for instance sensitive chats related to sexuality, anonymous media communications with sources (e.g. whistleblowers) as well as political activity. If you are under 17, you will no longer be able to install the following apps from the app store (reason given: risk of grooming): Messenger apps such as Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram or Twitter, social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok or Facebook, games such as FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, dating apps, video conferencing apps such as Zoom, Skype, Facetime. If you don’t use an appstore, compliance with the provider’s minimum age will still be verified and enforced. If you are under the minimum age of 16 years you can no longer use Whatsapp due to the proposed age verification requirements; the same applies to the online functions of the game FIFA 23. If you are under 13 years old you’ll no longer be able to use TikTok, Snapchat or Instagram. Click here for further arguments against messaging and chat control Click here to find out what you can do to stop messaging and chat control What you can do Do you fear that this law would cause massive damage to fundamental rights and is the wrong approach? What is important now is to increase pressure on the negotiators: Reach out to your government which is negotiating in Council. Contact your government’s permanent representation or your Ministry of the interior. Politely tell them your concerns about chat control (arguments here). Experience shows that phone calls are more effective than e-mails or letters. The official name of the planned mandatory chat control law is “Proposal for a Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse”. Talk about it! Inform others about the dangers of chat control. Here, you can find tweet templates, share pics and videos. Of course, you can also create your own images and videos. Generate attention on social media! Use the hashtags #chatcontrol and #secrecyofcorrespondence Generate media attention! So far very few media have covered the messaging and chat control plans of the EU. Get in touch with newspapers and ask them to cover the subject – online and offline. Ask your e-mail, messaging and chat service providers! Avoid Gmail, Facebook Messenger, outlook.com and the chat function of X-Box, where indiscriminate chat control is already taking place. Ask your email, messaging and chat providers if they generally monitor private messages for suspicious content, or if they plan to do so.

In the following, various claims are questioned and debunked: 1. “Today, photos and videos depicting child sexual abuse are massively circulated on the Internet. In 2021, 29 million cases were reported to the U.S. National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.” To speak exclusively of depictions of child sexual abuse in the context of chat control is misleading. To be sure, child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) is often footage of sexual violence against minors (child sexual abuse material, CSAM). However, an international working group of child protection institutions points out that criminal material also includes recordings of sexual acts or of sexual organs of minors in which no violence is used or no other person is involved. Recordings made in everyday situations are also mentioned, such as a family picture of a girl in a bikini or naked in her mother’s boots. Recordings made or shared without the knowledge of the minor are also covered. Punishable CSEM also includes comics, drawings, manga/anime, and computer-generated depictions of fictional minors. Finally, criminal depictions also include self-made sexual recordings of minors, for example, for forwarding to partners of the same age (“sexting”). The study therefore proposes the term “depictions of sexual exploitation” of minors as a correct description. In this context, recordings of children (up to 14 years of age) and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) are equally punishable. 2. “In 2021 alone, 85 million images and videos of child sexual abuse were reported worldwide.” There are many misleading claims circulating about how to quantify the extent of sexually exploitative images of minors (CSEM). The figure the EU Commission uses to defend its plans comes from the U.S. nongovernmental organization NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) and includes duplicates because CSEM is shared multiple times and often not deleted. Excluding duplicates, 22 million unique recordings remain of the 85 million reported. 75 percent of all NCMEC reports from 2021 came from Meta (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp). Facebook’s own internal analysis says that “more than 90 percent of [CSEM on Facebook in 2020] was identical or visually similar to previously reported content. And copies of just six videos were responsible for more than half of the child-exploitative content.” So the NCMEC’s much-cited numbers don’t really describe the extent of online recordings of sexual violence against children. Rather, they describe how often Facebook discovers copies of footage it already knows about. That, too, is relevant. Not all unique recordings reported to NCMEC show violence against children. The 85 million depictions reported by NCMEC also include consensual sexting, for example. The number of depictions of abuse reported to NCMEC in 2021 was 1.4 million. 7% of NCMEC’s global SARs go to the European Union. Moreover, even on Facebook, where chat control has long been used voluntarily, the numbers for the dissemination of abusive material continue to rise. Chat control is thus not a solution. Source 3. “64% increase in reports of confirmed child sexual abuse in 2021 compared to the previous year.” That the voluntary chat control algorithms of large U.S. providers have reported more CSEM does not indicate how the amount of CSEM has evolved overall. The very configuration of the algorithms has a large impact on the number of SARs. Moreover, the increase shows that the circulation of CSEM cannot be controlled by means of chat control. 4. “Europe is the global hub for most of the material.” 7% of global NCMEC SARs go to the European Union. Incidentally, European law enforcement agencies such as Europol and BKA knowingly do not report abusive material to storage services for removal, so the amount of material stored here cannot decrease. 5. “A Europol-backed investigation based on a report from an online service provider led to the rescue of 146 children worldwide, with over 100 suspects identified across the EU.” The report was made by a cloud storage provider, not a communications service provider. To screen cloud storage, it is not necessary to mandate the monitoring of everyone’s communications. If you want to catch the perpetrators of online crimes related to child abuse material, you should use so-called honeypots and other methods that do not require monitoring the communications of the entire population. 6. “Existing means of detecting and removing child sexual expoitation material will no longer be available when the current interim regulation expires in 2024.” Hosting service providers (filehosters, clouds) and social media providers will be allowed to continue scanning after the ePrivacy exemption expires. No regulation is needed for removing child sexual exploitation material, either. For providers of communications services, the regulation for voluntary chat scanning (chat control 1) could be extended in time without requiring all providers to scan (as per chat control 2). 7. metaphors: Chat control is “like a spam filter” / “like a magnet looking for a needle in a haystack: the magnet doesn’t see the hay.” / “like a police dog sniffing out letters: it has no idea what’s inside.” The content of your communication will not be seen by anyone if there is no hit. “Detection for cybersecurity purposes is already taking place, such as the detection of links in WhatsApp” or spam filters. Malware and spam filters do not disclose the content of private communications to third parties and do not result in innocent people being flagged. They do not result in the removal or long-term blocking of profiles in social media or online services. 8. “As far as the detection of new abusive material on the net is concerned, the hit rate is well over 90 %. … Some existing grooming detection technologies (such as Microsoft’s) have an “accuracy rate” of 88%, before human review.” With the unmanageable number of messages, even a small error rate results in countless false positives that can far exceed the number of correct messages. Even with a 99% hit rate, this would mean that of the 100 billion messages sent daily via Whatsapp alone, 1 billion (i.e., 1,000,000,000) false positives would need to be verified. And that’s every day and only on a single platform. The “human review burden” on law enforcement would be immense, while the backlog and resource overload are already working against them. Separately, an FOI request from former MEP Felix Reda exposed the fact that these claims about accuracy come from industry – from those who have a vested interest in these claims because they want to sell you detection technology (Thorn, Microsoft). They refuse to submit their technology to independent testing, and we should not take their claims at face value. The EU’s evaluation of child abuse detection tools is based solely on industry claims taken at face value. Mass surveillance is the wrong approach to fighting “child pornography” and sexual exploitation Scanning private messages and chats does not contain the spread of CSEM. Facebook, for example, has been practicing chat control for years, and the number of automated reports has been increasing every year, most recently reaching 22 million in 2021. Mandatory chat control will not detect the perpetrators who record and share child sexual exploitation material. Abusers do not share their material via commercial email, messenger, or chat services, but organize themselves through self-run secret forums without control algorithms. Abusers also typically upload images and videos as encrypted archives and share only the links and passwords. Chat control algorithms do not recognize encrypted archives or links. The right approach would be to delete stored CSEM where it is hosted online. However, Europol does not report known CSEM material. Chat control harms the prosecution of child abuse by flooding investigators will millions of automated reports, most of which are criminally irrelevant. Message and chat control harms everybody All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime. Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. No judge is required to order to such monitoring – contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications. According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place. The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed. Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have reportedly circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past. A Google engineer has been reported to stalk minors. Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day. According the Swiss Federal Police, 80% of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach. Similarly in Ireland only 20% of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”. Securely encrypted communication is at risk. Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc. Criminal justice is being privatized. In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision. Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates to more intrusive technologies and legislation. Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or “harmful content”. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back. Messaging and chat control harms children and abuse victims Proponents claim indiscriminate messaging and chat control facilitates the prosecution of child sexual exploitation. However, this argument is controversial, even among victims of child sexual abuse. In fact messaging and chat control can hurt victims and potential victims of sexual exploitation: Safe spaces are destroyed. Victims of sexual violence are especially in need of the ability to communicate safely and confidentially to seek counseling and support, for example to safely exchange among each other, with their therapists or attorneys. The introduction of real-time monitoring takes these safe rooms away from them. This can discourage victims from seeking help and support. Self-recorded nude photos of minors (sexting) end up in the hands of company employees and police where they do not belong and are not safe. Minors are being criminalized. Especially young people often share intimate recordings with each other (sexting). With messaging and chat control in place, their photos and videos may end up in the hands of criminal investigators. German crime statistics demonstrate that nearly 40% of all investigations for child pornography target minors. Indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the circulation of illegal material but actually makes it more difficult to prosecute child sexual exploitation. It encourages offenders to go underground and use private encrypted servers which can be impossible to detect and intercept. Even on open channels, indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the volume of material circulated, as evidenced by the constantly rising number of machine reports. Alternatives Strengthening the capacity of law enforcement Currently, the capacity of law enforcement is so inadequate it often takes months and years to follow up on leads and analyse collected data. Known material is often neither analysed nor removed. Those behind the abuse do not share their material via Facebook or similar channels, but on the darknet. To track down perpetrators and producers, undercover police work must take place instead of wasting scarce capacities on checking often irrelevant machine reports. It is also essential to strengthen the responsible investigative units in terms of personnel and funding and financial resources, to ensure long-term, thorough and sustained investigations. Reliable standards/guidelines for the police handling of sexual abuse investgations need to be developed and adhered to. Addressing not only symptoms, but the root cause Instead of ineffective technical attempts to contain the spread of exploitation material that has been released, all efforts must focus on preventing such recordings in the first place. Prevention concepts and training play a key role because the vast majority of abuse cases never even become known. Victim protection organisations often suffer from unstable funding. Fast and easily available support for (potential) victims Mandatory reporting mechanisms at online services: In order to achieve effective prevention of online abuse and especially grooming, online services should be required to prominently place reporting functions on the platforms. If the service is aimed at and/or used by young people or children, providers should also be required to inform them about the risks of online grooming. Hotlines and counseling centers: Many national hotlines dealing with cases of reported abuse are struggling with financial problems. It is essential to ensure there is sufficient capacity to follow up on reported cases. Improving media literacy Teaching digital literacy at an early age is an essential part of protecting for protecting children and young people online. The children themselves must have the knowledge and tools to navigate the Internet safely. They must be informed that dangers also lurk online and learn to recognise and question patterns of grooming. This could be achieved, for example, through targeted programs in schools and training centers, in which trained staff convey knowledge and lead discussions. Children need to learn to speak up, respond and report abuse, even if the abuse comes from within their sphere of trust (i.e., by people close to them or other people they know and trust), which is often the case. They also need to have access to safe, accessible, and age-appropriate channels to report abuse without fear.

commentary and further reading Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights: “Report on the right to privacy in the digital age” (4 August 2022) “Governments seeking to limit encryption have often failed to show that the restrictions they would impose are necessary to meet a particular legitimate interest, given the availability of various other tools and approaches that provide the information needed for specific law enforcement or other legitimate purposes. Such alternative measures include improved, better-resourced traditional policing, undercover operations, metadata analysis and strengthened international police cooperation.” UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, General comment No. 25 (2021): “Any digital surveillance of children, together with any associated automated processing of personal data, should respect the child’s right to privacy and should not be conducted routinely, indiscriminately or without the child’s knowledge…” Prostasia Foundation: “How the War against Child Abuse Material was lost” (19 August 2020) European Digital Rights (EDRi): “Is surveilling children really protecting them? Our concerns on the interim CSAM regulation” (24 September 2020) Civil Society Organizations: “Open Letter: Civil society views on defending privacy while preventing criminal acts” (27 Oktober 2020) “we suggest that the Commission prioritise this non-technical work, and more rapid take-down of offending websites, over client-side filtering […]” European Data Protection Supervisor: “Opinion on the proposal for temporary derogations from Directive 2002/58/EC for the purpose of combatting child sexual abuse online” (10 November 2020) “Due to the absence of an impact assessment accompanying the Proposal, the Commission has yet to demonstrate that the measures envisaged by the Proposal are strictly necessary, effective and proportionate for achieving their intended objective.” Alexander Hanff (victim of child abuse and privacy professional): “Why I don’t support privacy invasive measures to tackle child abuse.” (11 November 2020) “As an abuse survivor, I (and millions of other survivors across the world) rely on confidential communications to both find support and report the crimes against us – to remove our rights to privacy and confidentiality is to subject us to further injury and frankly, we have suffered enough. […] it doesn’t matter what steps we take to find abusers, it doesn’t matter how many freedoms or constitutional rights we destroy in order to meet that agenda – it WILL NOT stop children from being abused, it will simply push the abuse further underground, make it more and more difficult to detect and ultimately lead to more children being abused as the end result.” Irish victim of child sexual abuse (5 June 2022): “Using the veil of morality and the guise of protecting the most vulnerable and beloved in our societies to introduce this potential monster of an initiative is despicable.” German victim of child sexual abuse (25 May 2022): “Especially being a victim of sexual abuse, it is important to me that trusted communication is possible, e.g. in self-help groups and with therapists. If encryption is undermined, this also weakens the possibilities for those affected by sexual abuse to seek help.” French victim of child sexual abuse (23 May 2022): “Having been a victim of sexual violence myself as a child, I am convinced that the only way to move forward on this issue is through education. Generalized surveillance of communications will not help children to stop suffering from this unacceptable violence.” AccessNow: “The fundamental rights concerns at the heart of new EU online content rules” (19 November 2020) “In practice this means that they would put private companies in charge of a matter that public authorities should handle” Federal Bar Association (BRAK) (in German): “Stellungnahme zur Übergangsverordnung gegen Kindesmissbrauch im Internet” (24 November 2020) „the assessment of child abuse-related facts is part of the legal profession’s area of responsibility. Accordingly, the communication exchanged between lawyers and clients will often contain relevant keywords. […] According to the Commission’s proposals, it is to be feared that in all of the aforementioned constellations there will regularly be a breach of confidentiality due to the unavoidable use of relevant terms.” Alexander Hanff (Victim of Child Abuse and Privacy Activist): “EU Parliament are about to pass a derogation which will result in the total surveillance of over 500M Europeans” (4 Dezember 2020) “I didn’t have confidential communications tools when I was raped; all my communications were monitored by my abusers – there was nothing I could do, there was no confidence. […] I can’t help but wonder how much different my life would have been had I had access to these modern technologies. [The planned vote on the e-Privacy Derogation] will drive abuse underground making it far more difficult to detect; it will inhibit support groups from being able to help abuse victims – IT WILL DESTROY LIVES.” German Data Protection Supervisor (in German): „BfDI kritisiert versäumte Umsetzung von EU Richtlinie“ (17 Dezember 2020) “A blanket and unprovoked monitoring of digital communication channels is neither proportionate nor necessary to detect online child abuse. The fight against sexualised violence against children must be tackled with targeted and specific measures. The investigative work is the task of the law enforcement authorities and must not be outsourced to private operators of messenger services.” European Digital Rights (EDRi): Wiretapping children’s private communications: Four sets of fundamental rights problems for children (and everyone else) (10 February 2021) “As with other types of content scanning (whether on platforms like YouTube or in private communications) scanning everything from everyone all the time creates huge risks of leading to mass surveillance by failing the necessity and proportionality test. Furthermore, it creates a slippery slope where we start scanning for less harmful cases (copyright) and then we move on to harder issues (child sexual abuse, terrorism) and before you realise what happened scanning everything all the time becomes the new normal.” German Bar Association (DAV): “Indiscriminate communications scanning is disproportionate” (9 March 2021) “The DAV is explicitly in favour of combating the preparation and commission of child sexual abuse and its dissemination via the internet through effective measures at EU-level. However, the Interim Regulation proposed by the Commission would allow blatantly disproportionate infringements on the fundamental rights of users of internet-based communication services. Furthermore, the proposed Interim Regulation lacks sufficient procedural safeguards for those affected. This is why the legislative proposal should be rejected as a whole.” Letter from the President of the German Bar Association (DAV) and the President of the Federal Bar Association (BRAK) (in German) (8 March 2021) “Positive hits with subsequent disclosure to governmental and non-governmental agencies would be feared not only by accused persons but above all by victims of child sexual abuse. In this context, the absolute confidentiality of legal counselling is indispensable in the interest of the victims, especially in these matters which are often fraught with shame. In these cases in particular, the client must retain the authority to decide which contents of the mandate may be disclosed to whom. Otherwise, it is to be feared that victims of child sexual abuse will not seek legal advice.” Strategic autonomy in danger: European Tech companies warn of lowering data protection levels in the EU (15 April 2021) “In the course of the initiative “Fighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content”, the European Union plans to abolish the digital privacy of correspondence. In order to automatically detect illegal content, all private chat messages are to be screened in the future. This should also apply to content that has so far been protected with strong end-to-end encryption. If this initiative is implemented according to the current plan it would enormously damage our European ideals and the indisputable foundations of our democracy, namely freedom of expression and the protection of privacy […]. The initiative would also severely harm Europe’s strategic autonomy and thus EU-based companies. Article in “Welt.de: Crime scanners on every smartphone – EU plans major surveillance attack“ (in German) (4 November 2021) Experts from the police and academia are rather critical of the EU’s plan: on the one hand, they fear many false reports by the scanners, and on the other hand, an alibi function of the law. Daniel Kretzschmar, spokesman for the Federal Board of the Association of German Criminal Investigators, says that the fight against child abuse depictions is “enormously important” to his association. Nevertheless, he is skeptical: unsuspected persons could easily become the focus of investigations. At the same time, he says, privatizing these initiative investigations means “making law enforcement dependent on these companies, which is actually a state and sovereign task. “ Thomas-Gabriel Rüdiger, head of the Institute for Cybercriminology at the Brandenburg Police University, is also rather critical of the EU project. “In the end, it will probably mainly hit minors again,” he told WELT. Rüdiger refers to figures from the crime statistics, according to which 43 percent of the recorded crimes in the area of child pornographic content would be traced back to children and adolescents themselves. This is the case, for example, with so-called “sexting” and “schoolyard pornography “, when 13- and 14-year-olds send each other lewd pictures. Real perpetrators, who you actually want to catch, would probably rather not be caught. “They are aware of what they have done and use alternatives. Presumably, USB sticks and other data carriers will then be increasingly used again,” Rüdiger continues. European Digital Rights (EDRi): Chat control: 10 principles to defend children in the digital age (9 February 2022) “In accordance with EU fundamental rights law, the surveillance or interception of private communications or their metadata for detecting, investigating or prosecuting online CSAM must be limited to genuine suspects against whom there is reasonable suspicion, must be duly justified and specifically warranted, and must follow national and EU rules on policing, due process, good administration, non-discrimination and fundamental rights safeguards.” European Digital Rights (EDRi): Leaked opinion of the Commission sets off alarm bells for mass surveillance of private communications (23 March 2022) In the run-up to the official proposal later this year, we urge all European Commissioners to remember their responsibilities to human rights, and to ensure that a proposal which threatens the very core of people’s right to privacy, and the cornerstone of democratic society, is not put forward. Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS): Europe has a right to secure communication and effective encryption (March 2022) “In the view of our experts, academics and IT professionals, all efforts to intercept and extensively monitor chat communication via client site scanning has a tremendous negative impact on the IT security of millions of European internet users and businesses. Therefore, a European right to secure communication and effective encryption for all must become a standard.”",

Unless representative democracies are inherently undemocratic (and therefore most European government themselves undemocratic), I fail to see how this can be described as \"anti-democratic\". In basically every democracy there is a way for the elected representatives to push through legislation which is unpopular or only supported by a small portion of the population.

This is a perfectly fine statement. The policy is argued to be anti-democratic because of its substance, not because of how democratic the process is by which it is adopted. A measure with broad popular support can be anti-democratic, a measure only supported by a small portion of the population can be pro-democratic. It's orthogonal and if anything there is an inverse correlation. reply constantcrying 7 hours agorootparentThe issue of chat control is also orthogonal to it's \"democracy\".

It obviously in no way invalidates people's rights to determine their government, labeling arbitrary issues as \"anti-democratic\" just because you don't like them is very unhelpful. reply vidarh 7 hours agorootparentWithout expressing my stance on this policy itself: Many measures can be reasonably called \"democratic\" or \"anti-democratic\" because they have the potential to affect the ability of the populace to express dissent, and organise political opposition, or because it is seen of creating the tools for the government to create a chilling effect in that respect. As such, it is not at all \"obvious\" that everyone will agree that it does not affect peoples democratic rights, whether you think so or not. reply bux93 7 hours agorootparentprevNonsense.

I loved the Norwegian one for example, but if you require the return of both or nothing, you will likely end up with a net reduction in returned plastic.

Yoghurt is best when shaken before opening the bottle because its viscosity spreads evenly, otherwise you get watery yoghurt on top, bottom is too dense. I enjoy having morning breakfast in the park, drinking yoghurt straight from the bottle. When I shake it, yoghurt sticks to the cap. When caps were removable, I'd put it aside so that yoghurt that stuck to the cap does not spill on my shirt, re-screw it after I finish and throw bottle and cap to the bin. Now it's hard to remove the cap and I spill yoghurt on my shirt frequently, so I go to greater lengths to tear the cap away and re-screw when I empty the bottle. reply NekkoDroid 4 hours agorootparentI guess that is a case. But generally this isn't something that is a problem on most bottles.

Tetrapack milk packages have some sort of a \"roof\" on top. The opening is on one of the sides of the roof. It is hard to drink from that anyway, now additionally the cap is pressing against the lips. You don't have to \"deep throat\" a water bottle either to feel the effect. The cap always disturbs.

Even if I wanted to vote accordingly to this proposal, I simply couldn't. reply arlort 5 hours agorootparentthis specific proposal had the benefit of already having had votes on it, so you could've probably found the parties' voting records there. But yeah, there's a broader issue with how european politics is approached since it is always so nationalized that these kind of votes end up as referendums on the national government, which in turn breeds ignorance of what the EU is responsible for and for what it isn't which feeds the vicious cycle of apathy I'm mildly optimistic it'll get better since the EU and EU politicians are getting more visible.

If you sit down with them and explain (something like: what if this happens and you agree to the scanning, 20 years from now Putin invades your country and you get dragged off the gulag on day #1 because 17 years ago you sent a derogatory image of him to someone; they said they would delete everything!?!), most would probably vote against, but no-one is doing that. reply l33tman 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, some of the parties did. In Sweden for example, the government parties just decided to greenlight the EU proposal that is up for vote now, even though their EU parliament representatives (from the same parties) had said before the recent EU election that they were against it (they even celebrated publicly last autumn when the proposal was downvoted last time). It's a mess trying to keep track of the party politics to be fair and it's possible the EU parliament members are voting in one way while their \"mother party\" in the home land votes in another way.

No one asked for this law, but you can convince the populace a posteriori that this is good for them, certainly. It's all part of the game. The fact that the hoi polloi can be easily persuaded in any direction is not a reason for the people in power to do whatever the f they want with our rights, hiding beneath the banner of democracy. Also, whoever says that we, the nerds, should do more to educate the masses is disingenuous when the people in power have massive reach.

I think there are only two groups of people who still care about this: - Tech people who are willing to give up QoL to cling to privacy-respecting alternatives. (People like us.) These people are a tiny minority which would be irrelevant in any democratic system. - Old people who haven't yet arrived in the digital age. These are also a minority, and keep becoming fewer. I think the vast majority of people have fully accepted constant surveillance of their digital activity by companies (and therefore governments) as simply the way things are. To these people, this law is a benefit to security with zero tradeoff. Normal people have no online privacy whatsoever anyway. And only evil people would use encryption and anonymization, right? (Tangent 1: Goverments could educate people in a representative democracy, too. People could also use the educational material readily available. But I think most people don't want to be educated on the majority of topics.) (Tangent 2: I don't think direct democracy is a good system. I think that the vast majority of people (including me) are incapable of making good laws. I believe only a trained professional, aka a politician, is capable of understanding and predicting all the possible long term effects a law, such as e.g. a trade deal, can have. I certainly cannot.)

These services make mass surveillance difficult or impossible, and targeted surveillance of their users requires significant effort, such as installing malware on a target's device. reply zaik 9 hours agoparentprevI self-host a standard XMPP server for my family.

As a citizen of the European Union, I am committed to safeguarding our fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the right to privacy and the protection of personal data. The Chat Control Chat Control poses several significant risks: Invasion of Privacy: The proposed measures would lead to the mass surveillance of private communications, undermining the privacy of all EU citizens. This broad surveillance is disproportionate and infringes on our fundamental right to private correspondence. Security Risks: Weakening encryption to facilitate the monitoring of communications makes all users more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data, including financial information, personal communications, and sensitive business data. Potential for Abuse: Granting authorities the power to monitor private communications without adequate checks and balances can lead to misuse and abuse of power. This undermines trust in both governmental and digital platforms. Stifling Innovation: Chat Control could have a chilling effect on tech innovation within the EU. Companies may be discouraged from developing new technologies or offering their services in the EU due to increased regulatory burdens and privacy concerns. I urge you to oppose Chat Control and advocate for solutions that protect children online without compromising the privacy and security of all citizens. Alternatives such as targeted interventions, improved digital literacy, and support for responsible online behavior are more effective and less intrusive ways to achieve these goals. Protecting the privacy and security of our digital communications is crucial for maintaining trust in the digital economy and upholding the values of the European Union. I hope you will consider these points and vote against Chat Control. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. Yours sincerely, [your name/address/etc.] If you are outside the EU, change the first paragraph to: I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposed Chat Control legislation, despite not being a resident of the European Union. As someone who values privacy and security in digital communications, I believe this legislation has far-reaching implications that extend beyond the borders of the EU. reply CodinM 8 hours agoprevI tried, but got back answers like \"in this security climate? that sounds like a good idea\".

It doesn't add up. Seems like there is something weird about EU and pedophilia. Coincidentally, it seems as if the EU is operating under the thumb of a foreign power. After being involved in the tech sector there, it has been a recurring theme. I never heard about that stuff when working for US tech companies. In other countries, they also handle the problem but they don't constantly virtue-signal about it. Also when I was in the crypto space working on EU-backed projects, I heard rumors that some of the founders had been victims (or maybe also the other way? Like a cult) I inferred that they were being extorted. When I read conspiracy theories about that sort of stuff, it oddly resonates with some of my experiences in the tech sector when you get close to the big money and big politics.

In the case of the EU, it's a capitalist authoritarian project. reply mytailorisrich 9 hours agorootparentIt's not possible to achieve socialism without authoritarianism because that's the only way to enforce social ownership of the means of production against private ownership... Edit: There is no meaningul difference between socialism and communism, especially on this aspect (ownership of means of production), which is key to conclude that the system must be authoritarian. \"According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx, \"Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist society—positive humanism, socialism, communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that 'socialism' and 'communism' are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death\"\" [1] The 'distinction' was created by Lenin and the Bolcheviks for political purposes. \"The distinction between communism and socialism became salient in 1918 after the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party renamed itself to the All-Russian Communist Party, interpreting communism specifically to mean socialists who supported the politics and theories of Bolshevism, Leninism and later that of Marxism–Leninism,[53] although communist parties continued to describe themselves as socialists dedicated to socialism.\" [1] In Europe, most socialist parties have evolved to simply seek to implement socialist-inspired ideas within a capitalist society and perhaps state capitalism, whereas communist parties stayed on Lenin's line and seek to overthrow the system to set up a fully socialist society.

Maybe you meant communism? It would still be debatable, but not completely wrong. reply RandomLensman 9 hours agorootparentWhat is wrong about the means of production being under social ownership in socialism? Yes, socialism allows also some private property and there is spectrum of how much it is a planned economy but social ownership of the means of production is a central component of socialism. reply palata 5 hours agorootparentSocialism does not require an authoritarian state, period. It's much larger than that, and it is a gradient. Just like \"not being socialist\" does not mean that you are libertarian: you can be a moderate liberal. For instance, saying that public transportation should be public (i.e. belong to the state) does not mean that the state is authoritarian. You can have more moderate forms of socialism. I find it interesting that the Wikipedia articles are pretty different in different languages. In French it is much more moderate than in English, for instance: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialisme. reply RandomLensman 4 hours agorootparentThat wasn't really my point but rather that social ownership of the means of production is a defining characteristic of socialism (as it was conceived in opposition to capitalism). Maybe there is a voluntary way to it but I don't think that has happened anywhere on a large scale so far. These days there is a tendency to use socialism and practical present-day social democracy rather interchangeably, but I think that is problematic (and the latter doesn't really aim for socialism anymore, I'd say). reply mytailorisrich 4 hours agorootparentprev> For instance, saying that public transportation should be public (i.e. belong to the state) does not mean that the state is authoritarian. Sure, but that's not socialism. That's state capitalism at most. There is not gradient. If society is socialist then as per definition and as explained there must be authoritarianism to suppress any private initiative. The article in French says the same thing as I wrote before: \"socialist parties\" are no longer socialist: \"Le socialisme démocratique, c'est-à-dire un socialisme converti à la démocratie libérale et respectueux du jeu parlementaire, représente aujourd'hui la tendance majoritaire des partis socialistes, qui n'envisagent plus la rupture avec l'économie de marché.\" If they no longer want to get rid of the market economy and private ownership then they are no longer socialist at all!

That sentence precisely means that there is a gradient. reply mytailorisrich 2 hours agorootparentI am French, with an understanding of what words actually mean. This article is highly misleading, to be polite. Socialism that has converted to liberal democracy and no longer seeks to replace the market economy is simply not socialism by definition, it's basically social democracy. That's what I have been writing and repeating: It's not because it's called \"socialist party\" that it is socialist, and that has been the case for decades. Maybe you're too young to grasp this fully. reply palata 1 hour agorootparentI answered in another one of your comment :-). You think that it's not socialism anymore (which is fair, \"socialisme democratique\" is not \"socialism\" anymore), and I say that socialism has evolved (\"socialisme democratique\" is an evolution of socialism that works in democracies). In the end it's just a difference in the definition. The fact remains that the US don't really have the equivalent of \"Parti Socialiste\": the democrats would be on the right wing in France, right? reply malermeister 4 hours agorootparentprev> There is not gradient. If society is socialist then as per definition and as explained there must be authoritarianism to suppress any private initiative. This logic works both ways. There is authoritarianism to enforce private ownership in capitalism. The police is a tool of the capitalist class, designed to suppress any protest against the capitalist system.

For instance, in the UK the NHS is indeed in essence a socialist construct.

From an EU point of view, US people see everything that is not right or far right as \"the bad guys in Marvel comics\". reply mytailorisrich 8 hours agorootparentWhat is the difference between socialism and communism, then? If you listen to Leninists, 'communism' is the ultimate form of 'socialism' but really that was created because Russia's industry was judged too undeveloped to achieve what Marx described. But there is no meaningful systemic difference. I think \"EU people\" know that very well, including from experience. What's happened is that most \"socialist\" parties have shifted and now really only seek to implement socialist-inspired ideas with a capitalist society, whereas communist parties still seek actual socialism. reply palata 5 hours agorootparent> What is the difference between socialism and communism It's a bit like the difference between \"liberal\" and \"libertarian\". It is a gradient. Socialism is a more global term that includes communism. Communism wants to remove social classes and the notion of state. But there are ways of being socialist in a democratic state. It is a gradient, you can be more or less extreme. Communism is a pretty extreme notion of socialism. Some EU countries are more \"social\", i.e. the socialist parties are strong and society is organized in a much, much social way than the US. But US people have this tendency to think that either you are libertarian, or you are communist. reply mytailorisrich 4 hours agorootparentAs said, most socialist parties in Europe are no longer socialist... There is no gradient. Either you want private ownership or you want socialised ownership. I think you are not quite clear about what \"socialism\" means because there are so many \"socialist\" parties in Europe that have not actually been socialist for 70+ years... For instance in France, with people from the socialist party always referred to as \"les socialistes\"... Well, Miterrand and, say, Strauss-Khan, and even Macron (former banker...) who was finance minister in a \"socialist government\" are obviously as socialist as Barak Obama. The historic French socialist party, the SFIO, founded in 1905 was really socialist and split following the Russian revolution, whose supporters created the communist party (and they were actually the majority of the SFIO's members). They stayed socialist while the \"socialist party\" shifted over time to effectively social democracy. I think that this is because of the realisation that socialism requires authoritarism and does not work anyway, while pushing for more social measures within capitalism and a market economy can work. reply palata 2 hours agorootparentAre you from the US, and trying to tell me that what EU people have been meaning by \"socialism\" in the last \"70+ years\" is wrong because that's not your definition? My feeling is that US people tend to struggle understanding that there are cultural differences in the world, and think that \"socialism\" has to mean what they understand from their US-centric point of view. \"Socialism\" is a bad word in the US, not at all in the EU. > are obviously as socialist as Barak Obama In my country, we tend to say that Barack Obama is our right wing, and those right to him are our far right. And that's not something you can debate: that's how we see it in my country. For me, Mitterrand is clearly to the left of Obama. And Macron is a fraud, I don't see the point in bringing him here. reply mytailorisrich 2 hours agorootparentWell, I am French, so really my comments were factual and a history lesson, really... \"Socialism\" has a precise meaning, as described several times in my previous comments. Socialism isn't social democracy. Socialism is a bad word in the EU for most people in Western Europe who have some perspective and understanding of what it means (again which is usually not the same as the parties that have \"socialist\" in their names advocate), and certainly for the people in Eastern Europe who actually experienced it firsthand. Perhaps there is a generational issue as well. When I grew up there were socialist countries in half of Europe and the French Communist Party was good friend with them and the big guys in Moscow (You know, the capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). Now, anyone under 35 was born after socialism disappeared from Europe so perhaps lack understanding, including that it is not a fairytale but an utter failure (hence shift away from it). reply palata 2 hours agorootparentRight. Then it feels like we only disagree on the surface :-). You seem to say \"Socialism as it used to be has disappeared\" and I say \"Socialism has evolved\". My original reaction towards US people is that I really feel like whatever is left on Barack Obama sounds authoritarian to them. You say \"public transport should be owned by the state\" and they say \"you deserve to go to jail, you socialist\" (I exaggerate obviously, just to make my point). They tend to forget that there is a world of opinions to the left of Obama (which, again, is on the right wing in my book), and that those opinions are still compatible with democracy. reply mytailorisrich 1 hour agorootparentWell, no. \"Socialism has evolved\" is nonsensical. Socialism has a definition so either that's what you want or that's not what you want... Socialism has disappeared from government and from what most \"socialist parties\" actually seek, which is in fact social democracy. There are still parties that seek socialism, or groups within parties that overall do not. reply zemnl 10 hours agorootparentprevHaving implemented social policies doesn't make the EU States socialists...

Reality is very different as the many many comments already point out to you. This is mostly for historic and cultural reasons which is hard to understand if you not actually seen it in practice. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparentprevIn the same way that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea isn't Democratic nor People's nor a Republic, yes. Check their programmes. > Socialism is an economic and political philosophy encompassing diverse economic and social systems[1] characterised by social ownership of the means of production,[2] as opposed to private ownership.[3][4][5] It describes the economic, political, and social theories and movements associated with the implementation of such systems.[6] Social ownership can take various forms, including public, community, collective, cooperative,[7][8][9] or employee.[10][11] Traditionally, socialism is on the left wing of the political spectrum.[12] Types of socialism vary based on the role of markets and planning in resource allocation, and the structure of management in organizations.[13][14] Go and find any even remotely mainstream \"Socialist\" party advocating for anything close to the above. They are unquestionably left leaning, but that means more social policies (for the people, like increasing minimum wage, expanding workers' protections, investing in youth, etc.), not seizing the means of production in any way. Hell, the last seizing of some of the means of production in France happened under the neoliberal, \"neither left nor right\" (but in reality centre-right) current president, Macron - STX France (currently and formerly Chantiers de l'Atlantique, one of the biggest shipyards in Europe) and EDF (national electricity provider and producer, and owner of all nuclear power plants in France). Under his predecessor, the socialist Francois Hollande, from the Socialist party, there was only a 12% investment in PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen, which has since then bought Opel and merged with Fiat-Chrysler to become Stellantis). reply tomalbrc 9 hours agorootparentprevYes. reply peoplefromibiza 9 hours agorootparentprev> So you also believe the \"socialist parties\" aren't actually socialist? Yep! 90% of the members of PSOE are not actually socialists, they only bear the name of it. Take for example the Democratic Party in Italy (PD), it's member of the PSOE, but it has became mainly \"a Catholic-inspired, centrist, catch-all party\" [1] with sprinkles of liberal individual rights (mostly LGBTQ stuff). Liberals are not socialists.

Socialism is a economical system where workers own the means of production instead of capital owners. You do not know the meaning of political terms and are using your own preconceived notions of what they mean to then call a very capitalistic institution (as the EU is) something it's not.

I must say that's not the most useful definition, and certainly not what anyone who's a proponent of anything they call \"socialism\" means by \"socialism\". reply HPsquared 9 hours agorootparentLike \"left/right\", it's always a question of degree. There is no pure version of any system. I was responding to a comment that seems to think the EU policies have not a trace of socialism in them, which is incorrect. Edit: and the extent of EU regulations is quite enormous. reply emptysongglass 8 hours agorootparentNo, you are incorrect. There is nothing socialist about the EU.

How “we must have minimal taxes in europe” is neoliberal. Industrial subsidies for car and aeroplane companies. Compulsary social and retirement policies. In EU socialism is the norm, everything outside is branded almost extreme right. And right is a bad word in EU. If you take right and cut out russian support, keep taxes and less money distribution, promote personal tesponsibility you are still extreme right. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparent> If you take right and cut out russian support, keep taxes and less money distribution, promote personal tesponsibility you are still extreme right. That describes to a T the French party \"Les Republicains\", and nobody calls them far right. So no, you need the extremist \"migrants bad\" with zero nuance, heavy doses of populism with no foundation, promises of more money distribution (in France, the Front National is promising raising the minimum wage, bringing back the wealth tax, and other such populist \"give money to the real people\" things), and yes, lots of Russian support and money and dicksucking, and you get a classic European far-right party. > In EU socialism is the norm What is your definition of socialism? Considering the EU hasn't nationalised/EU-lised anything to control the means of production, I can guarantee you it's wrong. The EU is neoliberal in many aspects, like the railway packages, strict rules on country subsidies into many sectors (countries can no longer just bail out their national industries when they fail). But it isn't only neoliberal. Consumer protections with warranties, GDPR, Digital Markets and Services Acts, etc. aren't strictly neoliberal. I don't know why anyone would think something as complex as the EU can be described with a political label. Hell, most parties can barely be described with a single label, let alone a multi-government entity with many institutions and responsible for some of the greatest progress and unity the continent has ever seen. reply jorvi 9 hours agorootparent> in France, the Front National is promising raising the minimum wage, bringing back the wealth tax, and other such populist \"give money to the real people\" things These are not populist things… reply sofixa 7 hours agorootparentIf there's no plan on how to finance such things in one of the countries with the highest public spending as % of GDP, relatively high budget deficits, a high debt to GDP ratio, slipping credit rating, monstrous pension obligations and impending demographic slowdown...

No substance, no real plan, no real solutions. reply Vt71fcAqt7 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy is \"migrants bad\" with zero nuance extremist? reply sofixa 6 hours agorootparentBecause it's little more than xenophobia, which has always been extremist. You don't want people with radically different value systems being allowed to migrate without making efforts to integrate themselves? Sure, say so. That's a reasonable position that can be debated. Maybe you'd be OK with asylum seekers fleeing for their lives, maybe not, to be discussed. You don't want anyone different to come to the country? That's xenophobia, and considering the demographic challenges facing the EU, stupid. And of course the funny thing is that most of the people espousing those extremist views and voting for the \"migrants bad\" parties are living in the countryside where there are practically no migratns and everyone knows everyone else. Cities, where those migrants (be they Afghanis or Ukrainians who ran for their lives, Sudanese looking for a better life) are actually concentrated, are markedly pro-much more open to migrants parties. reply pelorat 9 hours agorootparentprevNothing you mentioned has anything to do with socialism. reply kvgr 8 hours agorootparentDepends on the definition of socialism.

Your company will never be Google.\" That is, there was a big desire around that time period to \"build it how the big successful companies built it.\" But since then, a lot of us have realized that complexity isn't necessary for 99% of companies. When you couple that with hardware and standard databases getting much better, there are just fewer and fewer companies who need all of these \"scalability tricks\". My bar for \"Is there a reason we can't just do this all in Postgres?\" is much, much higher than it was a decade ago. reply ithkuil 11 hours agoparentWe also have much much bigger single machines available for reasonable money. So a lot of reasonable workloads can fit in one machine now that used to require a small cluster reply Dalewyn 11 hours agorootparentIt's kind of mind boggling just how powerful mundane desktop computers have gotten, let alone server hardware. Think about it: That 20 core CPU (eg: i7 14700K) you can buy for just a couple hundred dollars today would have been supercomputer hardware costing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars just a decade ago. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 10 hours agorootparentAccording to geekbench, an i9 4790 processor released a decade ago is ~5 times slower than i7 14700. 4790's go for $30 at ebay, vs $300 for 14700, so price/performance seems to be in favor of older hardware:) reply inglor_cz 9 hours agorootparentWhat about power consumption? When running a server 24/7, power is likely to be a bigger cost concern than the one-off cost of purchasing the processor. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentUnder full load, roughly 100W for the 4790, and 350W for the 14700. Note that both links are for the K variant, and also, both were achieved running Prime95. More normal workloads are probably around 2/3 those peak values. For a desktop, yeah, you’re generally better off buying newer from a performance/$ standpoint. For servers, the calculus can shift a bit depending on your company’s size and workloads. Most smaller companies (small is relative, but let’s go with “monthly cloud bill isbecause people realized \"You're not Google. Your company will never be Google.\" Is that also why almost no one is using microservices and Kubernetes? reply hn_throwaway_99 4 hours agorootparentI realize you're being sarcastic (I think), but I actually would put microservices in the same boat. There was a huge push to microservices in the mid teens, and a lot of companies came to hugely regret it. There is a reason this video, https://youtu.be/y8OnoxKotPQ, is so popular. And it's not that \"no one is using microservices\", it's just that tons of companies realized they added almost as many complications as they alleviated, and that for many teams they were just way too premature. And a lot of the companies that I've seen have the most success with microservices are also the most pragmatic about them: they use them in some specific, targeted areas (e.g. authn and authz), but otherwise they're content using a well-componentized monolith where they can break off independent services later if there is an explicit reason to do so. reply devjab 11 hours agorootparentprev> Is that also why almost no one is using microservices and Kubernetes? I don’t know of a single 100+ sized organisation in my area which doesn’t use micro services in some form. A lot of places also use kubernetes indirectly through major cloud provider layers line Azure Container Apps. Our frontend (and indeed quite a bit of our backend) lives in a NX mono-repo. As for how it actually works, however, it’s basically a lot of micro-services which are very independently maintainable. Meaning you can easily have different teams work on different parts of your ecosystem and not break things. It doesn’t necessarily deploy as what some people might consider micro services of course. But then micro services were always this abstract thing that is honestly more of a framework for management and change management than anything tech. reply fikama 9 hours agorootparentprevMaybe add /s ;).

But it’s nice especially since I have the know how. Creating a new deployment is just super fast. Developers can deploy their own apps etc. And then there is Helm. If we only decide by “need” then most of the time we also wouldn’t need object oriented programming. reply sofixa 12 hours agorootparent> And then there is Helm Right, who doesn't want to template hundreds of lines of code in a language that uses whitespace for logic and was never made neither for templating nor complex long documents(YAML)? What could possibly go wrong (\"error missing xxx at line 728, but it might be a problem elsewhere\"). reply ithkuil 11 hours agorootparentI wonder why people don't use fromYaml + toJson to avoid stupid errors with indent. Yaml is for all intents and purposes a superset of JSON so if you render your subtree as JSON you can stick it in a Yaml file and you don't need to care with indentation. reply ndthrowaway 10 hours agorootparentprev\"in a language that uses whitespace for logic\" This argument kind of died when python became one of the most popular programming languages used. reply cassianoleal 8 hours agorootparentPython uses whitespace for scoping - not for logic.

Can't you see how it's all in git? reply benterix 11 hours agorootparentWhat's wrong with having your infrastructure as code and storing it in Git? reply sofixa 10 hours agorootparentNothing. Even if it's objectively terrible (thousands of lines of templated YAML, or thousands of lines of spaghetti bash), being in Git as code is still better. At least you know what it is, how it evolved, and can start adding linting/tests. reply benterix 8 hours agorootparentI manage large IaC repos and it's mostly HCL, well-structured and easy to work with. Where we have Kubernetes manifests, they're usually split into smaller files and don't cause any trouble as normally we usually don't deploy manifests directly. reply xnickb 10 hours agorootparentprevYAML isn't code. Same as your reply, YAML has very little awareness of context. reply benterix 8 hours agorootparentIn computer science, the word \"code\" has a very specific meaning, and markup languages definitely fit this definition. reply fredrb 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not that bad if you need to deploy at least 3 things and for most cases it beats the alternatives. You can get away with a bootstrapped deployment yaml and a couple of services for most scenarios. What should you use instead? Vendor locked app platforms? Roll out your own deploy bash scripts? Sure the full extend of Kubernetes is complicated and managing it might be a pain, but if you don’t go bonkers is not that hard to use it as a developer. reply k8sToGo 9 hours agorootparentprevI don’t like helm itself. But I was referring to the deployment part. I like Kustomize more. reply spoiler 11 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, Helm kinda sucks (for all the reasons you mentioned). But Kustomize is very nice. Although, their docs could be a bit better. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentprevI’ve only ever seen a single dev team managing their own K8s cluster. If by deploy you mean “they merge a branch which triggers a lot of automation that causes their code to deploy,” you don’t need K8s for that. Don’t get me wrong, I like K8s and run it at home, and I’d take it any day over ECS or the like at work, but it’s not like you can’t achieve a very similar outcome without it. reply k8sToGo 2 hours agorootparentOf course. And I can achieve a Webserver in C. Doesn’t mean it’s the best way given the circumstances. There are many ways in tech to achieve the same result. I don’t understand why people constantly need to point that out. I also don’t understand why k8s ruffles so many feathers. Reminds me a bit of Linux vs windows vs Mac debates. reply Kirth 11 hours agorootparentprevGenuine question: say you have 3-4 services and a bunch of databases that make up your product, what's the alternative to plemping them all into K8s according to you? reply pcl 10 hours agorootparent3-4 services and a bunch of databases? Assuming there aren’t any particular scaling or performance requirements, if I were managing something like that, I would almost certainly not use k8s. Maybe systemd on a big box for the services? reply badcppdev 9 hours agorootparentI agree with you and I'm always confused when people talk about process isolation as a primary requirement for a collection of small internal services with negligible load. In addition the overhead and reporting drawbacks of running multiple isolated databases is vastly higher than any advantaged gained from small isolated deployments. reply strken 5 hours agorootparentprevIf I had 3-4 services and a bunch of databases, I would look at them and ask \"why do we need to introduce network calls into our architecture?\" and \"how come we're using MySQL and Postgres and MongoDB and a Cassandra cluster for a system that gets 200 requests a minute and is maintained by 9 engineers?\" Don't get me wrong, maybe they're good choices, but absent any other facts I'd start asking questions about what makes each service necessary. reply k8sToGo 9 hours agorootparentprevIn my home environment I run a VM with docker for that. In a commercial environment I’d still use kubernetes. But maybe something like k3s or if we are in a cloud environment something like EKS. Usually with time other services get added to the stack (elastic, grafana, argocd, …) reply Myoklov 10 hours agorootparentprevUsing cloud platform as a service options. For example, on Azure you can deploy such system with Azure App Service (with container deployment), or Azure Container Apps (very suitable for microservices). For database, you can use Azure Database for PostgreSQL (flexible), or Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. This way, Azure does most of the heavy lifting you would otherwise have to do yourself, even with managed kubernetes. reply kaba0 10 hours agorootparentprevFor personal stuff I simply run systemd services and that does scale quite a lot (as in, you can rely on it for more production services) I believe. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentMy hero. reply benterix 11 hours agorootparentprevIf you use AWS, it's probably easier to use ECS that takes away some of the complexity from you. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentMaybe at first, but once you start building all of the IaC and tooling to make it useful and safe at scale, you might as well have just run EKS. Plus, then you can get Argo, which is IMO the single best piece of software from an SRE perspective. reply 62951413 2 hours agorootparentprevAWS Fargate is popular among large companies in my experience. Some of them try to migrate from it to a unified k8s \"platform\" (i.e. frequently not pure k8s/EKS/helm but some kind of in-house layer built on top of it). It takes so long that your tenure with the company could end before you see it through. reply brazzy 9 hours agorootparentprevDocker compose is another option. reply benterix 11 hours agorootparentprevDefine \"no one\".

But ... most websites I load up have like a dozen things trying to gather data, whether for tracking, visitor analytics, observability, etc. Every time I view a page, multiple new unimportant messages are being sent out, and presumably processed asynchronously. Every time I order something, after I get the order confirmation page, I get an email and possibly a text message, both of which should presumably happen asynchronously, and possibly passing through the hands of more than one SaaS product en route. So given what seems to be the large volume of async messages, in varying/spiking volumes, possibly interacting with 3rd party services which will sometimes experience outages ... I gotta expect that a bunch of these systems are solving \"actual business problems\" of separating out work that can be done later/elsewhere, can fail and be retried without causing disruptions, etc in order to ensure the work that must happen immediately is protected. reply silverquiet 17 hours agorootparentBingo - I work on the backend of a medical system and basically anything that interacts with a 3rd party gets put into a queue so our application doesn't choke immediately when one of them has issues. We also have some uses for it within our system.

It's rare for the website devs to be doing anything more complex that adding in even more javascript to their pages for those, no need to message queues for that. Order confirmation emails and sms messages are triggered by the order submission, and again usually sent off to a 3rd party bulk email or SMS service. Twilio or Campaign Monitor or Mailchimp will have queues and retry mechanisms, but again the website devs are just firing off an API call to some 3rd party that's dealing with that. So there are no doubt message queues being used in non-sexy 3rd party services, but those companies probably consider that kind of thing to be their \"secret sauce\" and don't blog about it. reply KronisLV 14 hours agorootparent> Order confirmation emails and sms messages are triggered by the order submission, and again usually sent off to a 3rd party bulk email or SMS service. Twilio or Campaign Monitor or Mailchimp will have queues and retry mechanisms, but again the website devs are just firing off an API call to some 3rd party that's dealing with that. In my case, I need to compile templates for the e-mails to be sent, which is somewhat slow. Even if I have an in memory cache for the compiled templates that can then be quickly filled in with actual data, I don't want to make the first user to request them after a restart/flush wait like 4-7 extra seconds upon clicking on the confirm order button (in addition to any other 3rd party calls, checking payment status etc.). Ergo, I need to carry the actual e-mail preparation logic (regardless of whether I send it myself, or use a 3rd party service) out into a separate thread. The problem then is that I most likely don't want to create a new thread for every e-mail to be processed, so I need a queue for the requests and one or multiple worker threads. There is functionality for this in the stack I'm using so no big deal, except I can't pass live DB entities across threads, so I also need to serialize the data before passing it off to the queue and deserialize it inside of the queue (or just pass some IDs and do DB calls within the queue). Essentially I've created a simple queue system in the app code, since processing that data definitely shouldn't make the user wait on it. I can see why some might also go the extra step and opt for something like RabbitMQ, since at the end of the day my queue system is likely to be way more barebones than something that's been around for years.

There are a huge number of \"commercial\" things that are hitting several million dollars a month in revenue running Ruby On Rails or WordPress/PHP. You can scale a long long way with \"boring technology\". Way too many people think that are \"the unicorn\" who's user base is going to grow so quickly that then need billion simultaneous user scale right now - instead of realising that before they get even close to that they'll be generating enough revenue to have an engineering team of hundreds who will have rewritten everything two or three times with more suitable architectures already. If you need a billion users to turn a profit, then whether you admit it or not your business model is \"burn VC money until they stop giving it to us or we pivot using Doctorow's Enshittification blog posts as a guide book\". That though, is a vanishingly small percentage of all dev work. Most business models have a way too make real profits of thousands or perhaps tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions a month - and they should be rolling in profit to reinvest in future higher scale development well before they run out of fairly pedestrian \"boring technology\" platforms.

This is from purely startup-based experience (seed to Series A). A while ago I moved from microservices to monolith because they were too complicated and had a lot of duplicated code. Without microservices there's less need for a message queue. For async stuff, I used RabbitMQ for one project, but it just felt...old and over-architected? And a lot of the tooling around it (celery) just wasn't as good as the modern stuff built around redis (bullmq). For multi-step, DAG-style processes, I prefer to KISS and just do that all in a single, large job if I can, or break it into a small number of jobs. If I REALLY needed a DAG thing, there are tools out there that are specifically built for that (Airflow). But I hear they're difficult to debug issues in, so would avoid at most costs. I have run into scaling issues with redis, because their multi-node architectures are just ridiculously over-complicated, and so I stick with single-node. But sharding by hand is fine for me, and works well. reply appplication 14 hours agoparentTo your comment on Airflow, I’ve been around that block a few times. I’ve found Airflow (and really any orchestration) be the most manageable when it’s nearly devoid of all logic to the point of DAGs being little more than a series of function or API calls, with each of those responsible for managing state transfer to the next call (as opposed to relying on orchestration to do so). For example, you need some ETL to happen every day. Instead of having your pipeline logic inside an airflow task, you put your logic in a library, where you can test and establish boundaries for this behavior in isolation, and compose this logic portably into any system that can accept your library code. When you need to orchestrate, you just call this function inside an airflow task. This has a few benefits. You now decouple, to a significant extent, your logic and state transfer from your orchestration. That means if you want to debug your DAG, you don’t need to do it in Airflow. You can take the same series of function calls and run them, for example, sequentially in a notebook and you would achieve the same effect. This also can reveal just how little logic you really need in orchestration. There are some other tricks to making this work really well, such as reducing dependency injection to primatives only where possible, and focusing on decoupling logic from configuration. Some of this is pretty standard, but I’ve seen teams not have a strong philosophy on this and then struggle with maintaining clean orchestration interfaces. reply RangerScience 13 hours agorootparentHelpful comment! If I could pick your brain... I'm looking at a green field implementation of a task system, for human tasks - people need to do a thing, and then mark that they've done it, and that \"unlocks\" subsequent human tasks, and near as I can tell the overall task flow is a DAG. I'm currently considering how (if?) to allow for complex logic about things like which tasks are present in the overall DAG - things like skipping a node based on some criteria (which, it occurs to me in typing this up, can benefit from your above advice, as that can just be a configured function call that returns skip/no-skip) - and, well... thoughts? (: reply appplication 5 hours agorootparentI think there are some questions to ask that can help drive your system design here. Does each node in the DAG represent an event at which some complex automated logic would happen? If so, then I think the above would be recommended, since most of your logic isn’t the DAG itself, and the DAG is just the means of contextually triggering it. However, if each node is more of a data check/wait (e.g. we’re on this step until you tell me you completed some task in the real world), then it would seem rather than your DAG orchestrating nodes of logic, the DAG itself is the logic. In this case, i think you have a few options, though Airflow itself is probably not something I would recommend for such a system. In the case of the latter, there are a lot of specifics to consider in how it’s used. Is this a universal task list, where there is exactly one run of this DAG (e.g. tracking tasks at a company level), or would you have many independent runs of this (e.g. many users use it), are runs of it regularly scheduled (e.g. users run it daily, or as needed). Without knowing a ton about your specifics, a pattern I might consider could be isolating your logic from your state, such that you have your logical DAG code, baked into a library of reusable components (a la the above), and then allowing those to accept configuration/state inputs that allow them to route logic appropriately. As a task is completed, update your database with the state as it relates to the world, not its place in the DAG. This will keep your state isolated from the logic of the DAG itself, which may or may not be desirable, depending on your objectives and design parameters. reply tbcj 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re already in the Kubernetes system, Argo Workflows has either capabilities designed around what you are describing or can be built using the templates supported (container, script, resource).

Or to put it another way, once you remove the pipeline logic, what's left? reply gregw2 5 hours agorootparentAirflow provides straightforward parallelism and error handling of dependent subtasks. Cron really doesn’t. With cron you have to be more thoughtful about failover especially when convincing others to write failure safe cron in invoked code. With airflow you shouldn’t be running code locally so you can have a mini framework for failure handling. Cron doesn’t natively provide singleton locking so if the system bogs down you can end up running N of the same jobs at the same time which slows things down further. Airflow isn’t immune to this by default but it’s easier to setup centralized libraries that everything uses so more junior people avoid this when writing quick one off jobs. reply salomonk_mur 11 hours agorootparentprevObservability is a huge upside. reply adammarples 9 hours agorootparentBackfilling is also very useful reply flir 7 hours agorootparentThanks to both comments. reply csunbird 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly what we do, but with Spark instead.

The main issue with monoliths is that they don't have clear and explicit separation of concern between domain concerns, therefore it's very easy for your monolith codebase to devolve into a mess of highly interconnected spaghetti code with time. This is especially true if you're building something large with a lot of developers who don't necessarily understand all of the domain complexity of the code they're touching. Monoliths imo are better for smaller projects with a few devs, but otherwise within a few years most of the time you'll regret building a monolith. I also disagree with the duplicated code point. I don't understand why that would be a significant problem assuming you're using the same language and sharing packages between projects. This isn't a problem I've ever had while working on microservices anyway. I'd also debate whether they're anymore more complex than monoliths on average. My favourite thing about microservice architecture is how simple individual microservices are to understand and contribute to. The architecture and provisioning of microservices can be more complicated, but from the perspective of a developer working on a microservice it should be much simpler to work on compared to a monolith. reply wg0 15 hours agorootparentI think lots of microservices can be replaced with a monolith which in turn can be replaced with a set of composable libraries versioned separately. If anyone doubts that, this very browser used to read and write is built all the way up with dozens of libraries from compression, network, image encoding, decoding, video encoding decoding, encryption, graphics, sound and what not where each library is totally separate and sometimes was never intended to be used to build web browsers by the original authors. Rest assured, most of the business (or web 2.0 systems, search, curate, recommend, surface etc kind of) systems are a lot more simpler then an A class browser. reply jupp0r 12 hours agorootparentIf you are using Chrome, it's also a combination of multiple well separated processes talking via RPC with each other, which is pretty similar to microservices, although the separation boundaries are more influenced by attack mitigation requirements than your typical microservice architecture would be. reply wg0 12 hours agorootparentAnd even that process separation is spinning up more processes from within the same binary or build artefact.

Any dependency you add has to be explicit. There's nothing stopping you from adding that dependency but you can't just do it accidentally. The graph of dependencies between components makes for explicit separation of concerns just like you would have a graph of dependencies between different network services. reply jupp0r 12 hours agorootparentOr you just use a language with support for clear module API boundaries (vs something like Ruby where without bolt on hacks, every piece of code can call any other in the same process). reply btilly 15 hours agorootparentprevThe lower cost of a function call versus any microservice network call is a good performance advantage of a monolith. Monoliths also make refactoring code a lot easier. While in theory I agree about the spaghetti issue, in practice I haven't seen much of a difference. In part because microservices seem to encourage proactive overdesigning, and then the designs don't age well. I also find monoliths a lot easier to debug. You have the whole call stack, and you get rid of a lot of potential sources of latency problems. You don't have RPC calls that might sometimes get forgotten. Given the choice, I'd choose monolith every time. Unless, of course, microservices are needed for various other reasons. (Scale, the ability to distribute, etc.) reply matrix87 14 hours agorootparentprevMicroservices also introduce the issue of maintaining schema compatibility for messages between services which usually leads to additional code in order to maintain backward compatibility From a technical POV they are good for horizontally scaling different workloads which have a different resource footprint From my experience, when a company decides to go the microservice route, it's more for the sake of solving an organizational problem (e.g. making team responsibilities and oncall escalation more clear cut) than it is to solve a technical problem. Sometimes they will retroactively cite the technical benefit as the reason for using them, but it feels like more of an afterthought But in all honesty: microservices are very good at solving this organizational problem.

Monolith can run like a front service or background worker depending on the config? In a technical sense it is a complexity, but IME pales in comparison with the alternative of having to manage multiple services. I actually really like this model, it's pretty flexible. You can still have specialized server instances dedicated for certain tasks, but you have one codebase.

Sure, the same business logic is distributed across microservices, but a method call in a monolith can only fail in a couple of ways, while network calls are much more finicky - handling it in every case is pure added complexity in case of a microservice architecture. Also, don’t forget the observability part - a mainstream language will likely have a sane debugger, profiler, a single log stream, etc. I can easily find bugs, race conditions, slow code paths in a monolith. It’s much more difficult if you have to do it in a whole environment communicating with potentially multiple instances of a single, or multiple microservices. Lastly, we have programming languages to help us write correct, maintainable code! A monolith != spaghetti code. We have language tools to enforce boundaries, we have static analysis, etc. A refactor will work correctly across the whole codebase. We have nothing of this sort for microservices.

My engineers have done crazy things like: - Try to queue up tens of thousands of 100mb messages in RabbitMQ instantaneously and wonder why it blows up. - Send significantly oversized messages in RabbitMQ in general despite all of the warnings saying not to do this - Start new projects in 2024 on the latest RabbitMQ version and try to use classic queues - Creating quorum queues without replication policies or doing literally anything to make them HA. - Expose clusters on the internet with the admin user being guest/guest. - The most senior architect in the org declared a new architecture pattern, held an organization-wide meeting and demo to extol the new virtues/pattern of ... sticking messages into a queue and then creating a backchannel so that a second consumer could process those queued messages on demand, out of order (and making it no longer a queue). And nobody except me said \"why are you putting messages that you need to process out of order into a queue?\"...and the 'pattern' caught on! - Use Kafka as a basic message queue - Send data from a central datacenter to globally distributed datacenters with a global lock on the object and all operations on it until each target DC confirms it has received the updated object. Insist that this process is asynchronous, because the data was sent with AJAX requests. As it turns out, people don't really need to do all that great of a job and we still get by. So tools get misused, overused and underused. In the places where it's being used well, you probably just don't hear about it. Edit: I forgot to list something significant.

A few startups I worked at a NY scala shop that used tons of Akka (event-driven queuing scala thing). Why? Because a manager at his prior job \"saved the company\" when \"everything was slow\" by doing this, so mandated it at the new job? What were doing that required queueing? Not much, we showed people's 401ks on a website, let them adjust their asset mix, and sent out hundreds of emails per day. As you would expect, people almost never log into their 401k website. A year or so after working there I realized our servers had been misconfigured all along and basically had 0 concurrency for web-requests (and we hadn't noticed because 2 production servers had always served all the traffic we needed).

Surely it's because they focused on making onboarding easy? New hires just make a new microservice for every task they get, don't need to know the broader scope just the specs for the service. reply spacebanana7 8 hours agorootparentIt's hard to make code changes without understanding the broader scope. For example, a developer asked to change the payments processor from the Stripe API to the Adyen API needs to know about: 1) credential scoping across microservices and test environments 2) impacts on billing, tax management and customer support 3) the organisation's approach to external dependencies (e.g do they use some kind of internal registry) Microservices don't inherently make this kind of change more difficult. A well isolated payments microservice might even help. But having hundreds or thousands of microservices spread across several code repos makes it quite difficult to figure out how your change will affect other services. I acknowledge I've picked an extreme example that wouldn't be asked of a new hire. However, smaller versions of the same challenges will happen in the smaller API upgrades & migrations that make up a big part of what the average CRUD developer does. reply magicalhippo 4 hours agorootparentMy point is with microservices you can, in theory, write all that stuff in a spec, and hand it to some new kid on the block.

You can buy Confluent or RedPanda or MSK as a service and never have to administer Kafka yourself. Change Data Capture (CDC) has also gotten really good and mainstream. It's relatively easy to write your data to a RDBMS and then capture the change data and propagate it to other systems. This pattern means people aren't writing about Kafka, for instance, because the message queue is just the backbone that the CDC system uses to relay messages. These architectures definitely still exist and they mostly satisfy organizational constraints - if you have a write-once, read-many queue like Kafka you're exposing an API to other parts of the organization. A lot of companies use this pattern to shuffle data between different teams. A small team owning a lot of microservices feels like resume-driven developnent. But in companies with 100+ engineers it makes sense. reply angarg12 18 hours agoprevQueues are a tool in your distributed system toolbox. When it's suitable it works wonderfully (typical caveats apply). If your perception is indeed correct it'd attribute it to your 3rd point. People usually write blogposts about new shiny stuff. I personally use queues in my design all the time, particularly to transfer data between different systems with higher decoupling. The only pain I have ever experienced was when an upstream system backfilled 7 days of data, which clogged our queues with old requests. Running normally it would have taken over 100 hours to process all the data, while massively increasing the latency of fresh data. The solution was to manually purge the queue, and manually backfill the most recent missing data. Even if you need to be careful around unbound queue sizes I still believe they are a great tool. reply rossdavidh 18 hours agoprevMessage queues have moved on past the \"Peak of inflated expectations\" and past the \"trough of disillusinment\" into the \"slope of enlightenment\", perhaps even the \"plateau of productivity\". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle reply wildzzz 17 hours agoparentI used zmq to build our application used for testing new hardware. Everything comes in via serial every second so I made a basic front end for that serial bus that sends telemetry out over zmq and waits for any commands coming in using pub/sub. The front end piece can sit forever sending out telemetry no one ever hears or I can hook up a logger, debug terminal, data plotter, or a factory test GUI that runs scripts or all at once. Dealing with com ports on windows is a huge hassle so zmq lets me abstract those annoyances away as a network socket. Other engineers can develop their own applications custom to their needs and they have. Our old application tried to shove all of this functionality into one massive python script along with trying to update a complicated Tk GUI every second with new telem. The thing was buckling under its own weight and would actually screw up the serial data coming in if you were running a heavy script in another thread.

For example enqueue to SQS + poll became invoke server less process. There is a message queue in there somewhere just that it’s not as exposed. Or take AWS SNS which IMO is one level of abstraction higher than SQS. It became so feature rich that it can practically replace SQS.

When you enqueue something, you eventually need to dequeue and process it. A lambda just does that in a single call. It also removes the need to run or scale a worker. I think Kafka continues to be popular because it is used as a temporary data store, and there is a large ecosystem around ingesting from streams. I personally use queues a lot and am building an open source SQS alternative. I wonder if an open source lambda replacement would be useful too. https://github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ reply weitendorf 15 hours agoparentThis is a big part of it IMO. When your downstream consumers can scale up and down quickly, you don’t necessarily need anything in the middle to smooth out load unless your workloads are especially spiky. I think this also speaks to a related phenomenon where there are simply more tools and technologies you can buy or run “off the shelf” now. Back in the 2010s everybody was trying to roll their own super complex distributed systems. Nowadays you have a ton of options to pay for more or less polished products to handle that mess for you.

We use Redis as well but it is hard to run at scale. Hence, anything critical goes to SQS by default. SQS usage is so ubiquitous I can’t imagine anyone be interested in writing a blog post or presenting on a conference. Once you get used to SQS specifics (more than once delivery, message size limit, client/server tooling built, expiration settings, DLQ) I doubt there’s anything that can beat it in terms of performance/reliability Unless you have resources to run Redis/Kafka/etc yourself.

And once you do, it becomes really hard to ensure transactional safety across that boundary. Usually that's work you want to do in a request in order to return a timely error to the client. So most jobs these days tend to be background things, pre-caching and moving bits around on cdns. But every single one of those comes with a cost and most of us don't really want a mess of background jobs or distributed tasks. I just added a RabbitMQ-based worker to replace some jobs that Temporal.io was bad at (previous devs threw everything at it, but it's not really suited to high throughput things like email).

I think the simple usecase of async communication, with simple pub/sub messaging, is hugely useful and not too hard to use. We (as a Dev community) have just gotten over event sourcing, complex networks and building for unnecessary scale. I.e. we're past the hype cycle. My team uses NATS for Async pub/sub and synchronous request/response. It's a command driven model and we have a huge log table with all the messages we have sent. Schemas and usage of these messages are internal to our team, and are discarded from NATS after consumption. We do at-least-once delivery and message handlers are expected to be idempotent. We have had one or two issues with misconfiguration in NATS resulting in message replay or missed messages, but largely it has been very successful. And we were a 3 person dev team. It's the same thing as Kubernetes in my mind - it works well if you keep to the bare essentials and don't try to be clever. reply jackbauer24 7 hours agoprevRegarding this issue, I have some observations of my own. I've noticed that systems based on queues, such as Kafka, AMQP, etc., are still very widespread, for example in vehicle networking, transaction systems, and so on. I recently encountered a customer deploying Kafka on AWS, with monthly consumption of Kafka-related computing storage exceeding $1 million. The cluster scale is huge, containing various system events, logs, etc. I've also seen customers building IoT platforms based on Kafka. Kafka has become very central to the IoT platform, and any problems can cause the entire IoT platform to be unavailable. I personally have written over 80% of the code for Apache RocketMQ, and today I have created a new project, AutoMQ (https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq). At the same time, we also see that competition in this field is very fierce. Redpanda, Confluent, WarpStream, StreamNative, etc., are all projects built based on the Kafka ecosystem. Therefore, the architecture based on message queues has not become obsolete. A large part of the business has transformed into a Streaming form. I think Streaming and MQ are highly related. Streaming leans more towards data flow, while MQ leans more towards individual messages. reply ilaksh 14 hours agoprevI think it's simple: async runtimes/modules in JavaScript/Node, Python (asyncio), and Rust. Those basically handle message queues for you transparently inside of a single application. You end up writing \"async\" and \"await\" all over the place, but that's all you need to do to get your MVP out. And it will work fine until you really become popular. And then that can actually still work without external queues etc. if you can scale horizontally such as giving each tenant their own container and subdomain or something. There are places where you need a queue just for basic synchronization, but you can use modules that are more convenient than external queues. And you can start testing your program without even doing that. Actually async is being used a lot with Rust also, which can stretch that out to scale even farther with an individual server. Without an async runtime or similar, you have to invent an internal async runtime, or use something like queues, because otherwise you are blocked waiting for IO. You may still eventually end up with queues down the line if you have some large number of users, but that complexity is completely unnecessary for getting a system deployed towards the beginning. reply leftbrainstrain 3 hours agoparentTo back up the story regarding async a bit, at least on the front end ... A long time ago in the 2000s, on front-end systems we'd have a server farm to handle client connections, since we did all rendering on the server at the time. On the heavyweight front end servers, we used threading with one TCP connection assigned to each thread. Threading was also less efficient (in Linux, at least) than it is now, so a large number of clients necessitated a large number of servers. When interfacing with external systems, standard protocols and/or file formats were preferred. Web services of some kind were starting to become popular, usually just when interfacing with external systems, since they used XML(SOAP) at the time and processing XML is computationally expensive. This was before Google V8 was released, so JavaScript was seen as sort of a (slow) toy language to do only minor DOM modifications, not do significant portions of the rendering. The general guidance was that anything like form validation done on the client side in JS was to be done only for slight efficiency gains and all application logic had to be done on the server. The release of NGINX to resolve the C10K problem, Google V8 to make JS run faster, and Node.js to scale front end systems for large numbers of idle TCP connections (C10k) all impacted this paradigm in the 2000s. Internally, applications often used proprietary communication protocols, especially when interacting with internal queueing systems. For internal systems, businesses prefer data be retained and intact. At the time, clients still sometimes preferred systems be able to participate in distributed two-phase commit (XA), but I think that preference has faded a bit. When writing a program that services queues, you didn't need to worry about having a large number of threads or TCP connections -- you just pulled a request message from the request queue, processed the message, pushed a response onto the response queue, and moved on to the next request message. I'd argue that easing the strong preference for transactional integrity, the removal of the need for internal services to care about the C10k problem (async), and the need to retain developers that want to work with recent \"cool\" technologies reduced the driver for internal messaging solutions that guarantee durability and integrity of messages. Also, AWS's certifications try to reflect how their services are used. The AWS Developer - Associate still covers SQS, so people are still using it, even if it isn't cool. At my last job I saw applications using RabbitMQ, too. reply m1keil 18 hours agoprevI think it's all of the above. In large enterprises, there is usually some sort of global message bus on top of Kafka, AWS Kinesis or similar. In smaller shops, the need for dedicated message bus is over engineering and can be avoided by using the db or something like redis. It is still a message queue, just without a dedicated platform. reply ryapric 18 hours agoprevI think it's very much your last theory -- used everywhere but not as interesting to tell people about as it might have been a decade ago.

But... Isn't another reason why we don't see hype around message queues and such in Distributed Systems because they are standard practice now? This discourse feels around this feels like, \"message queues will make your architecture so much better, you should try it!\" and more like, \"just use a message queue...\" To feel like the hype isn't there anymore because the technology is just standard practice now. I could be wrong but whenever I come across any articles on building Distributed Systems, message queues and their variants are one of the first things mentioned as a necessity. reply socketcluster 17 hours agoprevI never fully understood the need for back end message queues TBH. You can just poll the database or data store every few seconds and process tasks in batches... IMO, the 'real time' aspect was only ever useful for front end use cases for performance reasons since short polling every second with HTTP (with all its headers/overheads) is prohibitively expensive. Also, HTTP long polling introduces some architectural complexity which is not worth it (e.g. sticky sessions are required when you have multiple app servers). Unfortunately, moving real-time messaging complexity entirely to the back end has been the norm for a very long time. My experience is that, in general, it makes the architecture way more difficult to manage. I've been promoting end-to-end pub/sub as an alternative for over a decade (see https://socketcluster.io/) but, although I've been getting great feedback, this approach has never managed to spread beyond a certain niche. I think it's partly because most devs just don't realize how much complexity is added by micromanaging message queues on the back end and figuring out which message belongs to what client socket instead of letting the clients themselves decide what channels to subscribe to directly from the front end (and the back end only focuses on access control). I think part of the problem was the separation between front end and back end developer responsibilities. Back end developers like to ignore the front end as much as possible; when it comes to architecture, their thinking rarely extends beyond the API endpoint definition; gains which can be made from better integrating the back end with the front end is 'not their job'. From the perspective of front-end developers, they see anything performance-related or related to 'architectural simplicity' as 'not their job' either... There weren't enough full stack developers with the required insights to push for integration efficiency/simplicity. reply ehnto 15 hours agoprevThey aren't a general solution and don't really add much to your average application.

If the different steps of a processing chain are distributed via queues, you rather have an overhead in collecting the information in a central place, I would think. reply ehnto 9 hours agorootparentThat is certainly true, but message queues are pretty well suited to tagging and audit logs. So the systems involved tag the messages and an audit repository can accept logs from all services. I guess this isn't in contrast to a monolith which is easier to log, but in contrast to non-message based microservices I think it's easier to implement the audit logging. reply mcqueenjordan 10 hours agoprevI think it's a mix of: 1. Queues are actually used a lot, esp. at high scale, and you just don't hear about it. 2. Hardware/compute advances are outpacing user growth (e.g. 1 billion users 10 years ago was a unicorn; 1 billion users today is still a unicorn), but serving (for the sake of argument) 100 million users on a single large box is much more plausible today than 10 years ago. (These numbers are made up; keep the proportions and adjust as you see fit.) 3. Given (2), if you can get away with stuffing your queue into e.g. Redis or a RDBMS, you probably should. It simplifies deployment, architecture, centralizes queries across systems, etc. However, depending on your requirements for scale, reliability, failure (in)dependence, it may not be advisable. I think this is also correlated with a broader understanding that (1) if you can get away with out-of-order task processing, you should, (2) architectural simplicity was underrated in the 2010s industry-wide, (3) YAGNI. reply steve_adams_86 12 hours agoprevThe only place I find the complexity of message queues worth the trouble is in the embedded world. The limited resources make messaging a sensible way to communicate across devices with a fairly agnostic perspective on what runs on the devices apart from the message queue. Most of us in the desktop computing world don't actually need the distribution, reliability features, implementation-agnostic benefits of a queue. We can integrate our code very directly if we choose to. It seems to me that many of us didn't for a while because it was an exciting paradigm, but it rarely made sense in the places I encountered it. There are certainly cases where they're extremely useful and I wouldn't want anything else, but again, this is typically in settings where I'm very constrained and need to talk to a lot of devices rather than when writing software for the web or desktop computers. As for your last point, the Internet of Things is driven by message queues (like MQTT), so depending on the type of work you're doing, message queues are all over the place but certainly not exciting to write about. It's day-to-day stuff that isn't rapidly evolving or requiring new exciting insights. It just works. reply ingvar77 11 hours agoprevI am under impression people are still actively using MQs but it’s just become a commodity and not as exciting as it was. I think two major cases - you need to do something asynchronous and in specific order. Simple example from past project: in a workflow/process management app (task manager on steroids) there’s a group of tasks (branch) that can be completed by multiple people in any order. When all tasks are done we have to mark the whole branch as completed and move workflow further. Many instances of the workflow are running at same time. Logic is much simpler to implement when you process all task completions within same workflow instance in order, but from different instances in parallel. It’s also much easier to provide close to realtime experience to users - when user clicks on a checkbox task is shown completed instantly as well as other effects- next task becomes active, branch shown as completed, whole workflow is shown as completed etc. reply perrygeo 5 hours agoprevMessage queues are great for flowing information to external systems, one-way. But it's always worth asking why you have separate systems in the first place. And if your app has to also consume from a queue, forming any sort of cycle, look out. Especially if they are services that are conceptually related, you will immediately hit consistency problems - message queues offer few guarantees about data relationships, and those relationships are key to the correctness of every system I've seen. Treating message queues as an ACID data store is a categorical mistake if you need referential integrity - ACID semantics are ultimately what most business processes need at the end of the day and MQ architectures end up accumulating cruft to compensate for this. reply perlgeek 9 hours agoprevI maintain and develop a message queue-based architecture at work (started around 2014), so here's my take: * message queues solve some problems that are nowadays easily solved by cloud or k8s or other \"smart\" infrastructure, like service discovery, load balancer, authentication * the tooling for HTTPS has gotten much better, so using something else seems less appealing * it's much easier to get others to write a HTTPS service than one that listens on a RabbitMQ queue, for example * testing components is easier without the message queue * I agree with your point about databases * the need for actual asynchronous and 1:n communication is much lower than we thought. reply Rury 4 hours agoprevIt's the same reason why any old fad isn't in vogue anymore - it's just how popular things go. I mean, message queues weren't exactly new things in the late 2000s... your standard GUI and mouse uses message queues, pretty much since the 1980s. More and more people just caught on over time, popularity hit a peak, and then people eventually moved on. They're still used in many places, just no longer what's being crazed about. reply jonahbenton 6 hours agoprevI see a fair amount of Kafka, while most other platforms have diminished. I think that is because people treat Kafka like a database/system of record. A queue is not a system of record. A lot of the difficulty in modeling a complex system has to do with deciding what is durable state vs what is transient state. Almost all state should be durable and/but durability is more expensive upfront. So people make tradeoffs to model a transition as transient and put in a queue. One or two or three years in, that is almost always a regretted decision. Message queues that are not databases/systems of record wind up glossing this durable/transient state problem, and then when you have also this unique piece of infrastructure to support, this is a now you have two problems moment. reply threecheese 17 hours agoprevA few things I’ve noticed, in a large “I pick things up and put them down” solution for high dollar-value remote transactions: - a lot of services we need to communicate with have much higher resiliency than in the past, and so we’ve seen a big decrease in operational tasks for our queues that are “guarding “ those transactions; newer workloads might have less of a need to guard; - many services we use support asynchronous execution themselves, using patterns like events/callbacks etc, and while they may use message queues internally we don’t necessarily have to do so; - in what would have been called an “enterprise integration” environment, we are using internal event buses more and more, given they enable looser coupling and everyone speaks http. From a technology perspective, message queuing has been commodified, I can pull an SQS off the shelf and get right to work.

But I only use them to pass messages, not actual data. so I might generate a million messages, but each message isdata transformation, and is easier to test.

    "originBody": "This Bridge Should Have Been Closed Years Before It Collapsed June 18, 2024 by Wesley Crump [Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.] On January 28, 2022, about an hour before dawn, the four-lane Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, collapsed without warning. Five vehicles, including an articulating bus, fell with the bridge, and another car drove off the abutment after the collapse, not realizing the bridge was gone. Although there were no fatalities, several people in the vehicles were seriously injured. And this bridge had been listed as being in ‘poor condition’ for over a decade. Anyone who walked by the supports in the park below would have had reason to question its safety, as seen in this sadly prophetic tweet from 2018, four years before the collapse. So, why was it left open in this state? While some initial findings were released earlier, the official NTSB report was delivered to the public this year in February, more than two years after the collapse and over a year after the replacement bridge was built and open. The report included the use of some really cool technology for the forensic study of structures and revealed systemic flaws in how we inspect, analyze, and prioritize repairs for bridges. In fact, the NTSB issued recommendations to basically every organization involved in this bridge from the bottom to the top, and they referenced that tweet that got so much attention. This is a crazy case study of how common sense can fall through the cracks of strained budgets and rigid oversight from federal, state, and city staff. And the lessons that came out of it aren’t just relevant to people who work on bridges. It's a story of how numerous small mistakes by individuals can collectively lead to a tragedy. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. The Fern Hollow Bridge was opened in 1973, replacing an aging arch bridge built at the beginning of the 20th century, crossing Frick Park and Fern Hollow Creek. The 1973 bridge used a K-Frame design with continuous steel girders supporting the deck, each with two angled steel legs supported on concrete thrust blocks. At the time, the bridge’s design was celebrated because it blended well into its settings. It was featured on the cover of the 1974 edition of Prize Bridges by the American Institute of Steel Construction. And a big part of why it looked so harmonious with the park below was the type of steel used for the design. The Fern Hollow bridge was fabricated from weathering steel, sometimes referred to by its genericized trademark, COR-TEN. And it was developed commercially right there in Pittsburgh by US Steel in the 1930s. Unlike most types of steel, whose rust can continually flake away, exposing more material to corrosion, the oxide layer on weathering steel (called its patina) is more stable and protective, shielding the underlying material against exposure to the elements. In that way, weathering steel acts kind of like aluminum, which protects itself from corrosion in a similar way. And, architecturally, it’s a nice material. You get this rustic look that can give structures a more comfortable and less obtrusive appearance. But weathering steel has a limitation: For a stable patina to form, the material has to stay mostly dry. If water pools or the steel is kept damp for extended periods, that patina of rust isn’t enough to protect the underlying steel, and it will continue to corrode. Corrosion of structural steel is called section loss by engineers, and it's easy to see why in these photos of the bridge. What’s more alarming than what’s in those photos is where they came from: inspection reports of the bridge. It’s not that this deterioration somehow went unnoticed. The bridge supports were clearly visible from a popular walking trail. Between 2005 and 2021, this bridge was inspected a total of 14 times! In those reports, you get a clear and vivid story of its decline. First were the drainage problems. You can see in these images from multiple previous bridge inspections there were drainage grates on the roadway that were 100 percent clogged. Rainwater, and even worse, salty meltwater from the frequent snow that Pittsburgh sees each winter couldn’t follow the prescribed drainage paths off the deck and into the creek below. Instead, that water would leak through the bridge deck, dribbling over the structural steel, and pooling in portions of the legs where webbing and tie-plates could catch puddles of water, leaves, and debris. The City was aware of the section loss due to these drainage problems for many years before the collapse. Nearly every inspection report noted problems with the drains and the accelerating corrosion that was resulting. In fact, in 2009, the cross-braces connecting each pair of legs were found to be failing, and steel cables were installed as a temporary retrofit until the framing could be replaced. These cables were lightly tensioned to add structural integrity to the bridge but were never meant to be a permanent solution. You can see the ends of two of these cables in this now-infamous tweet from 2018. Of course, the more notable feature of this image is the fully separated steel cross-brace! That photo was taken about nine years after the temporary cables were installed. And they remained in place for the rest of the bridge's life, which ended up being only four more years. But the cross-bracing between the legs wasn’t the only place where corrosion was an issue. The legs themselves were also fabricated from weathering steel, and that steel was suffering, too. Since 2005, inspection reports marked them in fair to poor condition with areas where the steel had completely rusted through. By 2019, all four legs were given the worst assessment possible for an individual bridge element. According to the code, that should trigger a structural review to check whether the integrity is affected by the poor condition of a structural element, but it was never done. And that’s not all. An important part of inspecting steel bridges is identifying members that are “fracture critical.” That’s engineering jargon, but the idea is actually pretty straightforward. It’s any piece of steel under tension that lacks redundancy. If it breaks, the bridge collapses. And these types of members get special attention because of their importance, so inspection teams identify them ahead of time to make sure they get a proper look. This drawing shows in green which elements of the bridge were considered to be fracture-critical. Notice that while the girders crossing the span are identified, the legs are not. And, at first glance, that might match your intuitions. Bridge piers, columns, and vertical supports usually don’t experience tension forces, right? They’re in compression. So if there’s a crack or break, the forces just squeeze it together, generally not that big a deal. But K-frame bridges are different. By splaying out the legs, there are loading conditions that can apply bending forces, putting part of each beam in tension. And, this particular bridge had another feature that was absolutely essential to its performance. Each leg of the bridge was essentially an I-beam: a central web with a top and bottom flange. To simplify the foundation design, each leg had a “shoe”: a tapered end that would connect to the concrete block. It’s clear that the narrower section would have less strength, so larger stiffeners were added to each shoe to strengthen that portion of the leg. These are just steel plates welded to the web and flanges to increase the leg’s rigidity. And I built a little cardboard model to clarify this point. This particular stiffener, called the transverse tie plate, bridges the two flanges right where they taper down. And if I apply a compressive force on the leg, it’s easy to see what kind of force that tie plate experiences as a result. It’s tension. These tie plates were fracture-critical members of the bridge, but never identified as such, and so, even though it was clear they were deteriorating quickly over time, the inspectors never elevated the concerns to a priority level that might have spurred a more immediate response. But there was another opportunity to catch the problem. In 2013, an inspector was concerned enough about the bridge's safety to recommend that it be reviewed for a load rating. Most bridges are designed to allow any legal load to pass over, but sometimes, either because of an old design or poor structural conditions, it's necessary to limit the weight of vehicles allowed. Engineers analyzed the bridge in 2014 and decided it could only handle 26 tons per vehicle, just over half of its previous rating. When NTSB reviewed that decision in hindsight, they found some pretty serious errors. For one, the load rating for the bridge was based on a layer of about 3 inches of asphalt paving on top of the concrete road deck. In reality, the bridge had about double that amount. The City’s records of the removal and addition of pavement were poorly kept, so the engineering firm doing the load rating had no idea there was so much extra weight. For two, the engineers didn’t fully account for all the corrosion on the legs. This was partly because inspectors hadn’t cleaned off the rust to measure and report the actual thickness of the remaining steel. Even so, the engineers used a method that distributed the section loss from corrosion evenly along the entire leg, instead of applying it where it actually was, at the shoes and tie plates. That’s a pretty commonly-used simplification that usually generates conservative results (since the worst corrosion is rarely located at the most critical part of a structure), but again, that wasn’t the case for the Fern Hollow Bridge, and no one had recognized how important those tie plates really were. And for three, those engineers made an incorrect assumption about how the bridge’s legs would buckle. A structural member under compression will buckle at different loads depending on how much restraint it has at the ends. This is something you learn in year one of engineering. If you keep a column from rotating at its ends, you substantially increase the amount of force it can withstand, and with the original cross-bracing between the legs, that would have been the case. But I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that steel cables don’t provide the same support as rigid members. Again, this is engineering 101: “You can’t push a rope.” The cables provided some restraint, but not in the same way that the original bracing could, so the load rating applied to the bridge ended up significantly overestimating its actual capacity. In fact, when NTSB updated the load rating with these errors fixed, they found that the bridge should have been limited to 3 tons, basically nothing for a bridge. In effect, this load rating exercise should have closed the bridge to traffic entirely. These structural issues were exactly what the process was meant to identify. But instead, the bridge stayed open to everyone except the largest of trucks,and here’s what happened, courtesy of NTSB’s animation team. The transverse tie plate on the southwest leg, weakened by corrosion, failed first under tension, separating the flanges on the leg, and ultimately causing it to buckle. With no redundancy in the supports, the loads had nowhere to go, and so the rest of the bridge fell into the valley below. The articulated bus had both rear-facing and forward-facing cameras on it, which captured some truly harrowing footage of the event. Looking at the rear-facing camera, you can see the western portion of the bridge begin to fail. Keep an eye on the railing, and you can see the exact moment it starts. Once it started, there was no stopping it. Within two seconds, the front-facing camera shows that the collapse had propagated all the way to the eastern abutment, and the bridge fully failed. Thankfully, the collapse happened during particularly inclement weather. School delays and generally poor conditions meant that traffic was lighter than normal, and the weather also likely kept folks away from the trail underneath. On a fair weather day during rush hour, it wouldn’t be uncommon for the eastbound lanes of the bridge to be fully occupied by heavy traffic, and the trail underneath to be populated with dog walkers, families, or even classes on field trips from nearby schools. The bridge also carried a large gas line, which was severed during the collapse, leading to a major leak and some evacuations, but they got it shut off in time. It really is remarkable that nobody was killed in a failure of this magnitude. But there were still multiple victims needlessly affected for the rest of their lives by the collapse, not to mention the overall erosion of trust in the organizations and engineering systems meant to keep the public safe. By pure happenstance, President Biden was set to arrive in Pittsburgh on the very day of the collapse to speak in support of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, so he rearranged his trip to make some remarks at the site. One of the entities supported by the act is the National Highway Performance Program, which ultimately funded the replacement of the collapsed bridge. But at that time, no one understood the full scope of neglect and bad assumptions that led to the gradual, and then sudden, demise of the bridge. In those two years after Fern Hollow Bridge fell, the NTSB conducted numerous interviews with those involved, from the paving contractors to the inspectors to the bridge rating engineers. They performed 3D laser scanning of the bridge components to compare them to as-built conditions. They tested sections of steel for strength and durability. They reviewed all the previous records of the design, construction, and repairs. And they built a detailed finite-element model of the bridge to confirm that the gradual corrosion of one small structural element, the transverse tie plate on the southwest leg, initiated the collapse. And then they documented why it got to that point: the City of Pittsburgh just didn’t fix it. This figure in the NTSB report tells the story as clearly as I think is possible. From 2005 onward, recommendations from inspection reports to repair parts of the bridge didn’t fall off the list. They just kept being repeated by each new inspection, year after year. Since 2007, every single inspection report that included recommendations said to repair the stiffener plates in the legs that were heavily corroded. These were Priority 2 recommendations, which means the timeframe to complete them is before the next inspection. But it was never done. They didn’t fix the drainage problems that were accelerating the corrosion, they didn’t apply the protective coatings that might have slowed it down, and they never analyzed the capacity of the legs after they were rated the worst possible condition a structural element can have. And, apparently, there was no mechanism to follow up on those recommendations by the state charged with overseeing the bridge inspection program. When there was finally a chance to recognize how deficient the structure really was through a new load rating, the engineers made a few bad assumptions, missed it by a mile, and left the bridge open, a ticking time bomb, for years. (Years, by the way, in which the City still didn’t address the recommendations from inspection reports.) Due to the nature of the emergency, the site was cleaned up quickly, with a huge crane brought in to remove the bus, and building of the replacement bridge happened on a fast-track schedule. The new bridge uses a more conventional design: pre-stressed concrete girders on vertical piers. The formed stone texture on the columns certainly doesn’t blend into the park as well as the graceful and patinaed K-frame once did, but I doubt anyone involved in the project could stomach another structure built from weathering steel, given the circumstances. The new bridge might not win any awards for beauty, but it could win some for speed. After a colossal effort from the design and construction teams, it opened to limited traffic less than a year after the collapse in December of 2022, and by July the next year, it was fully operational. It would be almost a year later before the NTSB concluded why the previous bridge collapsed, not for the purpose of blame, but to issue recommendations to prevent something like this from recurring in the future. And unlike the recommendations from those inspection reports, many of the NTSB recommendations have already been put into practice. They published a special report on weathering steel bridges to highlight the specific challenges of keeping them in good condition, and they identified several similar bridges that needed a closer look. The City of Pittsburgh quadrupled their spending on inspection, maintenance, and repairs. And they redid the load ratings on all the bridges they owned, resulting in one bridge being closed until it can be rehabilitated and two more having lane restrictions imposed. PennDOT released a technical bulletin to shore up their bridge inspection program. And even the federal government has implemented a process to identify, prioritize, and follow up on recommendations related to weathering steel bridges. But as I read through those recommendations from the NTSB, one thing struck me: They all add up to more paperwork. And this is just my own personal opinion as someone who did this kind of work for nearly a decade (not on bridges, but other large infrastructure projects). We have these national inspection standards and procedures - huge documents that you could spend an entire career understanding. We have the Federal Highway Administration overseeing the program, state DOTs charged with carrying it out, individual bridge owners, like Pittsburgh, responsible for inspecting their own bridges, and then the private contractors who do most of the actual work. We have this huge machine with thousands of people, federal, state, and local involvement, and millions of dollars meant to keep the traveling public safe. And what did it do for us when a photo like this is all it would take any reasonable person to say: “This bridge needs to be fixed”? This big machine, in a lot of cases, has all the work sectionalized out. The inspectors see the bridge up close, but they have no autonomy to do anything but document and give recommendations. It’s not their bridge. But the owners who are charged with the safety of their bridges just see a piece of paper. Each recommendation is just another one on the list of sometimes hundreds of action items, to sort and prioritize and try to find the budget to cover. All the NTSB recommendations feel a little bit like bandaids if the real source of the problem was that no one person in this whole machine had both a full appreciation of the bridge's condition and the authority to do something about it. And if that’s the case, I’m not sure any of those recommendations really fixes that problem. I don’t know what the answer is, and I’m still wrestling with trying to understand how something like this can fall through the cracks of the enormous system we’ve built for the sole purpose of trying to prevent it. If you take a walk on the Tranquil Trail through Frick Park beside Fern Hollow Creek and look carefully, you can still see remnants of the old bridge. And I’m glad the City left them, because they’re a good reminder that design and construction are two parts of a three-part system for keeping people safe. Maintaining infrastructure is thankless work. Don’t get me wrong, it can be a really rewarding career. Inspections involve a lot of time out in the field seeing cool structures up close. And repair projects are often interesting challenges for contractors. But they’re not rewarding in the same way that designing and building new stuff can be. No one holds a press conference and cuts a big ribbon at the end of a bridge inspection or structural retrofit. Building a new structure is not just an achievement in its own right; it’s a commitment to take good care of it for its entire design life, and then to rehabilitate, or replace, or even close it when it’s no longer safe for the public. And I think this is the perfect case study to show that there’s more we could do to encourage and celebrate that kind of work as well. June 18, 2024 /Wesley Crump",

If there are any external goals for the things being discussed, almost everything can be bad (and correspondingly, almost everything can be good.) I feel like this thought process leads to the \"worst possible category\" containing 42k bridges. The construction of the categories was based around whether the bridge is safe, and this category says \"the bridge is not safe.\" It's when you put it off long enough, and let the infrastructure deteriorate long enough, that you start going \"which is the most unsafe though?\" Or, \"is a safety factor even necessary? They are by definition a >1.0 factor applied to what we think is safe.\" Then, \"one in a hundred year events\" or \"once in a decade events.\" Eventually it's \"hasn't collapsed yet!\" The fact that the list got that big means our problem isn't prioritization, our problem is failing to repair bridges.

One of the major causes of the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse was certainly the deficient drainage caused by blocked drains. Bridges (and buildings) are designed as systems. Water management is one of the biggest headaches in civil engineering - poor performance of any subsystem with a water management role is a legitimate cause for concern. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentprevSo the industry's rating system maps this bridge - totally fucked, key structural members rusted away entirely, others with large, clearly visible holes right through important points, weakened to the point it ended up falling down - to \"structurally deficient\" and then maps \"structurally deficient\" to \"not necessarily unsafe\" ? Kinda makes me think George Carlin was on to something with his hate of soft, euphemistic language. reply rcxdude 1 hour agorootparentThat's one of the points in the video: the paperwork tends to obscure the state of the system to decision makers. It's easy for the bridge inspectors (or even a random member of the public) to see that it needs to be closed down and repaired, but it's not what the decision-makers see: they see a 100-page report with a long list of action items, many of which are not actually incredibly urgent, much like every other bridge they get inspected. It makes it difficult to actually get a good sense of where the bigger problems are.

Why does the US have to spend money on military aid to first world countries, even if a very sizable chunk is spent on American weaponry? That money could be spent on maintenance rather than fattening our MIC. NGOs are similar.

The reason is geopolitical. It is seen as necessary to give money to allies to prop up their military so the US hegemony can be maintained. Adversaries (China, Russia, Iran) need to be made afraid not only of US might, but also of Allies’ might.

After centuries of fighting they quieted down after outsourcing it to the US. And since they weren't fighting that outsourcing wasn't even that expensive.

The majority of the major bridges in poor condition in California (and most other states, I presume) were built with Federal highway funds which started drying up in the 1970s, leaving a huge hole in the finances for maintenance.

I'm not sure the Trump administration actually did anything about it – I don't really follow US politics that closely. My point is: people do care. I think the bigger problem is maintenance is just one cost out of many. There's also education, and health care, and social services, and police, and firemen, and pensions, and all sorts of other things, and that's also important. It's relatively easy to \"save\" on maintenance because nothing is going to fall down immediately and no one will really notice – at least not for a while. In the long run you're not really saving anything of course. It's easy to critique this from the sidelines, but the pressures politicians and governments are under make it pretty tricky to do anything else. Saving money in other areas is going to be unpopular. Raising taxes even more so. A lot of times stuff like this is a Kobayashi Maru. reply dmurray 11 hours agoprevIf you knew all this, would you have avoided driving over the bridge? Would you have wanted the local government to close it indefinitely awaiting repairs? Let's say it would collapse with 100% certainty randomly in the next three years, and you're in the danger area for 2 minutes, with a 20% chance of fatality (in fact, nobody died). That's still around a one in 4 million chance any given trip kills you, about the same as 30 miles of driving for the average American driver. Most people would accept that level of risk. Perhaps not to save a couple of minutes on the journey, but if everyone was redirected to another route at rush hour, it might cost each commuter 10-20 minutes. A handful of newsworthy bridge collapses per decade across the US doesn't seem so bad. Instead of negligence, perhaps that indicates an appropriate level of maintenance and risk tolerance, and an appropriate human price to add to the 500,000 other road deaths over the same period. reply rob74 10 hours agoparentA well-maintained (and well designed, but there's no reason to think the design was at fault here) bridge shouldn't collapse. Ever. \"Appropriate maintenance\" in this case would have been to periodically unclog the drains so the water can run off in a controlled fashion and not pool and corrode the supports. How expensive can that be? Instead, the bridge collapses (and they were lucky that no one was killed in the collapse), and they have to replace it for millions of dollars. Money saved on maintenance is the very definition of the proverb \"penny wise, pound foolish\" IMHO. reply amanaplanacanal 9 hours agorootparentI don’t know how things work in other countries, but in the US new construction is almost always funded with a big chunk of federal dollars (deficit spending), but maintenance has to be done out of your own state or local budget. The incentives are all fucked up. reply Sharlin 8 hours agorootparentYeah, that sounds really strange. Not sure how it is elsewhere in Europe, but in Finland whoever builds it, maintains it. Intercity road and rail networks are all owned and managed by the state, and that’s actually how the equivalents of \"road\" and \"street\" are defined within the field: anything owned by the state is a road, anything owned by the municipality is a street. In recent years there have been plans to \"boulevardize\" some major arterials within city boundaries, meaning the city takes over responsibility of the road segment and turns it into a street with lower speed limits, multimodal access, and so on. The intention is, of course, to facilitate urban development in the corridor. reply dmurray 2 hours agorootparentFinland joined the EU too late and too rich, perhaps. In other countries the EU was the main source of funds for building motorways, but doesn't own them or maintain them. reply p1mrx 3 hours agorootparentprevMaybe we should spend federal dollars on stainless steel, to reduce maintenance costs. reply wazoox 8 hours agorootparentprevSame in other countries for many things. It's relatively easier to spend big on white elephants but almost impossible to get basic day-to-day operation money. Case in point right now at the France-Italy border : they're building the longest rail tunnel in the world under the Alps for tens of billions. There is a tunnel already (Frejus tunnel), which is used at 25% of its capacity, but public money is raining on this unstoppable, useless project. On the other end, all over Europe and particularly in France and Italy, rail and road infrastructures are in a state of disrepair. Wouldn't this money be better used repairing thousands of bridges, tunnels, etc? Sure, but no politician could campaign on \"I've got billions spent in our region!\". No multinational civil engineering and construction company such as Eiffage or Bouygues would get big money. All the big boys are in favour of the project, and all the small guys simply don't count. This is all completely fucked-up, frankly. It's a general failure of democracy and a global corporate takeover. reply em-bee 7 hours agorootparentthat's because the frejus route is unsuitable for high speed rail. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin%E2%80%93Lyon_high-speed_... Additional traffic limitations stem from the impact of excessive train transit on the population living near the line. Some 60,000 people live within 250 m (820 ft) of the historical line, and would object to the noise from late-night transits. In 2007 the conventional line was used for only one-third of this calculated total capacity. This low use level was in part because restrictions such as an unusually low maximum allowable train height and the very steep gradients (26–30‰) and sharp curves in its high valley sections discourage its use. A 2018 analysis, by contrast, found the existing line close to saturation, largely because safety regulations now prohibit passenger and freight trains from crossing in a single-tube tunnel. This very significantly reduces the maximum allowed capacity of the 13.7 km long Fréjus tunnel, which trains of one type must now fully cross before any train of the other type can be allowed in the other direction. The historical line's path through the deep Maurienne valley is also exposed to rockfalls, and a major landslide in August 2023 forced its closure for most likely over one year. reply wazoox 1 hour agorootparentNo that's barely a bad excuse. The projected market for the new line is 500 000 passengers a year, that's 2 trains each way per day. That doesn't even begin making the slightest sense. As passenger traffic cannot be a valid justification, they turned towards fret trains. Too bad, fret has been dropping between France and Italy for some years. Fret trains have dropped dramatically in France well below the European average (17% of cargo traffic) to 9 to 10% of traffic. If you want to revive freight trains, you can't just build one frigging tunnel, you need to rebuild almost from scratch the whole thing first because Fret SNCF has been closed down in 2023 and dismantled! With the amount of money invested you could probably fly everyone from Lyon to Turin on expensive aviation biofuel for centuries before recouping the humongous investment. This is just stupid grandiosity allied with corruption. reply bregma 8 hours agorootparentprevAh, but replacement comes out of the capital budget not the operating budget, and involves ribbon cuttings and speechifying on opening day as opposed to inconvenient lane closures or even hidden ongoing tasks that are invisible to the voter. reply spuz 10 hours agoparentprevI believe regardless of the actual probability of failure, most people would have refused to drive across the bridge had they seen one of the supports had become completely detached. Another way to put it is if authorities had closed the bridge in 2019, I believe most people wouldn't complain when they were presented the photo of the detached support. Also I don't think it's possible for your risk calculation to be done preemptively. We don't know the final breaking point of a piece of steel until we break it. All the calculations and modelling of the bridge will have been done with error margins and because of that we don't have any choice but to over-engineer things so we always stay outside of the worse-case margin for error. Given all that, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the risk of a bridge collapse to be a lot lower than the average risk we take on the road. reply jameshart 5 hours agoparentprev> Let's say it would collapse with 100% certainty randomly in the next three years, and you're in the danger area for 2 minutes, with a 20% chance of fatality Or how about let's say it would collapse with 100% certainty randomly in the next three years, and a school bus with twenty kids in it drives over the bridge twice a day, with each child facing a 20% chance of fatality. ‘I probably won’t be the one who dies when it collapses’ is a terrible metric for whether or not we should try to mitigate the risk of a bridge collapse. reply tzs 5 hours agoparentprev> That's still around a one in 4 million chance any given trip kills you, about the same as 30 miles of driving for the average American driver. For those wondering if that is right, it is. Here's the math. Americans drive about 3.2 trillion miles per year and about 40 000 people are killed. That's one death per 80 000 000 miles. Assuming each mile is equally deadly, that chances you survive a given a mile would be 79 999 999 / 80 000 000. To survive a trip of N miles, you have to survive each individual mile sequentially. The chances of that would be (79 999 999 / 80 000 000)^N. The chance of not surviving that trip would then be 1 - (79 999 999 / 80 000 000)^N. For N = 30 that is 1 / 2 666 667, which is close enough to dmurray's number to count as a match. There's enough fuzziness is in the inputs that all we can hope for is the same ballpark. I've seen others say the rate is one death per 120 000 000 miles, and for N = 30 that does give 1 / 4 000 000, so I'd guess they are using that rate. > Most people would accept that level of risk. Perhaps not to save a couple of minutes on the journey, but if everyone was redirected to another route at rush hour, it might cost each commuter 10-20 minutes One big difference is that with the bridge everyone has the average risk. I cross the bridge, I'm rolling a d4000000 and hoping I don't get a 1. With a car I can take steps to make the chances of dying on my particular trip much lower than average. With the car I can often time my trip so as to go at times of day or during weather conditions or during traffic conditions when accident rates are lower. reply danielhep 7 hours agoparentprevSomething I think you're missing here is that when the bridge collapses, cars can no longer drive across it until a new bridge is built, so the inconvenience is almost certainly much worse than if they'd just closed it for maintenance for a bit in the first place. reply hedora 3 hours agorootparentAlso, it probably would have been a lot cheaper to have someone roto-rooter all the drains of all the bridges in Pittsburg once a year than to clean up one collapsed bridge and rebuild it on short notice.

They're not really equivalent, unless you've got a high-risk condition like asthma. Statistically speaking, a 100% chance of losing one year of lifespan (out of the 76 years an American can expect) is a greater mortality risk than a 1% chance of instant, immediate death. In fact, if you're aged 26, a 1% chance instant death has half the mortality risk - and the older you get, the better it looks. However, if you look at humans' revealed preferences, people would much rather lose one year of lifespan than take a 1% chance of losing their entire remaining lifespan.

Pittsburgh has a very high number of bridges, if you go anywhere in that city and you don't want to cross a rusty bridge, you can't go very far. reply icegreentea2 4 hours agorootparentThere's rusty, and then there's \"I can see daylight through the steel\". I think most people can accurately diagnose that as an actual, real problem. reply kube-system 4 hours agorootparentThat isn't an uncommon sight around Pittsburgh.

How does that 1:4M probability change when you commute over the bridge twice a day? Humans are notorious for being bad gauging risk, and we very often make the mistake that past success means lower risk of future failure, which for a deteriorating bridge is exactly the opposite of what's going to happen. In my opinion bridges shouldn't collapse, like ever. Annual inspections for years prior pointed to a severely deteriorating structure, even after the temporary cable stays were put in place. The tweet with a picture of a completely detached member a couple of years before the collapse makes this even more egregious. This is a textbook example of where bureaucracy prevails over common sense. Heads should roll. Thankfully nobody died, but the lack of maintenance and upkeep resulted in a total failure, wasting lots of taxpayer money to replace. reply EricE 4 hours agorootparentThe Pinto thing was dramatically overblown. And seriously set back the acceptance of small cars in the US. For a supposed environmentalist and consumer advocate, Ralph Nadar did FAR more harm than good by grifting off a bunch of sensationalist poppycock.

You can get a good sense of this from the equivalence listed immediately after the odds: >> That's still around a one in 4 million chance any given trip kills you, about the same as 30 miles of driving So it'd be closely analogous to driving a 30-mile commute twice a day. How much risk do you feel that involves? reply Panzer04 7 hours agorootparent2x daily 30 mile commute sounds like a (relatively) substantial risk to me? Driving is already more or less the most dangerous activity most people engage in nowadays, tolerated by long acclimatization and sheer utility. Moreover, people generally perceive things in which they (theoretically) have more control over as safer - You can control/mitigate the risk you undertake as a driver to some extent (drive slower, bigger gaps, etc), not so for a random bridge collapse. reply thaumasiotes 10 hours agoparentprev> Let's say [...] you're in the danger area for 2 minutes, with a 20% chance of fatality > That's still around a one in 4 million chance any given trip kills you That's a one in five chance that any given trip kills you, unless 20% means something very different to you than it does to me. reply defrost 11 hours agoprevFor those interested in the official NTSB report: Collapse of the Fern Hollow Bridge Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania January 28, 2022 Highway Investigation Report HIR-24-02 released: February 21, 2024 PDF (136 pages): https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/... reply viewtransform 11 hours agoparentNTSB Animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-VnWB4fiFk reply gp 2 hours agoprevI used to walk across this bridge every day.

It's so much nicer not having a five lane stroad that lets cars go 50mph into a park, and instead having a pseudo-community space. reply kibwen 11 hours agoprevIt really is supremely fortunate that the collapse took place in the early morning when few people were about. I've walked under that bridge many times, it's a lovely recreational footpath through the heart of Frick Park, and more than once I've clambered up the hillside under the bridge for fun. reply francisofascii 6 hours agoprevAn interesting takeaway is that a simple task like cleaning the drainage grates and preventing them from being clogged probably would have saved the bridge. The bridge has a prescribed drainage path, and with the grates clogged the water drains and pools in other places, accelerating the corrosion. reply glitcher 3 hours agoprevNot an engineer, found the video on this fascinating and very approachable. It sounds like the NTSB report did a surprisingly good job of addressing the multiple mistakes and failures that led to the bridge collapse. But to the bigger point made near the end, without a person in the loop who both appreciates the meaning held within the inspection reports AND having the power to act on that information, we still remain vulnerable to the complexity of our own social systems becoming too inefficient to handle problems like this. reply 7ep 5 hours agoprev> No one holds a press conference and cuts a big ribbon at the end of a bridge inspection or structural retrofit. maybe they should. maybe we could celebrate repair like we do new construction. there’s a comfort in knowing we’ve been put good again that’s worth signifying. reply chiph 2 hours agoprevTo prevent this from happening in the future, I would give the inspectors the right to immediately close a bridge when it got to be this bad. If the owner forcibly reopened it, they would lose any insurance coverage on it (be totally liable for consequences). reply simple10 2 hours agoparentThis seems reasonable, but there's also the concern of abuse of power. Like when the mob or politicians had control of local labor unions and inspectors on payroll. They would force closures of bridges, roads, building, etc to hire mob run construction companies to do the repairs. Maybe there are enough federal safeguards in place for this now at DOT (Department of Transportation) level. reply more_corn 5 hours agoprevThis is why I think nuclear power is a bad idea. Paying back a multibillion dollar investment takes decades. Operating costs eat into profits. The financial incentive is to run them as cheaply as possible for as long as possible. In a place where there’s a strong work ethic and good maintenance history that might be fine. Look around at your infrastructure before climbing on the nuclear bandwagon. reply samatman 4 hours agoparentA better comparison for nuclear power is the airplane industry. No one goes into the bridge running plant every day and runs the bridge for a living, with several people assigned to run a daily checklist on said bridge. But it's still not a very good comparison, because airplanes, due to their very nature, can't be designed to fail safe. Nuclear power plants can. reply fh973 11 hours agoprevThis is all interesting, but misses the point: the bridge collapsed due to a social (management, responsibilities, organization, ...) failure.

For me it’s more accurate, too. At $work, there’s no difference to how an SWE vs a “DE” works. Same interview process too, DSA, distributed systems etc. However, having done this for more than a decade, that is relatively rare. It’s usually a mix of GUI tools with zero reproducibility / infra-as-code, untyped python, copy pasted shell scripts, zero tests, zero ci/cd, no lifting/static analysis/code reviews etc., paired with generally zero understanding of the underlying tech. It’s all very formulaic with little to no actual understanding. I will spare you my usual rant on why a language without a solid type system like python is a horrible idea for this field, too. Which is why I much appreciate dbt. While some people scoff at the idea of “SQL with jinja templating”, their approach has certainly helped to move DE closer to SWE work, purely by virtue of their value prop mostly being exactly that.

The answer to a skills shortage is not a practitioner lockdown, but policy, training, guidance and mentoring. If you're stuck in start up land and you have this issue, you have hired the wrong skills. If you're encountering this in enterprise land, your organisation, and potentially you depending on your position of influence, should be angling to improve compliance and literacy not through obstruction but through policy and upskilling. Failing to do so will kill your ability to innovate. reply necovek 13 hours agorootparentFWIW, while I disagree with the parent comment, I don't see you arguing against it. They actually implied that you should try upskilling first — but if that fails, you shouldn't be doing ETL yourself. I mostly disagree with the parent comment because there's so many things one can easily do up to a level, and then when the going gets tough, you need to call in an expert. Eg. most people can operate a screwdriver or impact driver to fix things, but to fix some problems, you really need a trained technician (or well, an experienced DIY person, but that's not everybody). The fact that you are not strong enough to screw in an M14 bolt does not mean you should be forbidden from using an impact driver: tools are there to help you. The logic of the parent comment was seemingly that if you are not strong enough to tighten an M14 bolt, you probably don't know what you are doing regardless of the type of the bolt you are tightening, so you should simply not do it. The point I agree with in a parent comment is that not everybody can achieve a similar level of proficiency: while upskilling and improving/simplifying tools can get you most of the way there, there's always going to be that extra bit that requires a sudden, sharp jump in knowledge, smartness or experience to be able to deal with it. reply ic_fly2 4 hours agorootparentI’m all for upskilling. On your example, when I was an intern in a factory, I was banned from the pneumatic tools with a counter grip. Because if you use them incorrectly your finger/ hand / arm is a flesh pancake.

The answer to a skills shortage is not a practitioner lockdown, but policy, training, guidance and mentoring.

I want to say \"anything here in the pipeline that I will define that behaves like a table, apply it this transformation\", so that I can swap my storage later without touching the pipeline.

It's not necessary to answer these questions in the docs but it is useful for folks who may be familiar with the other options out there. reply thibautdr 16 hours agoparentThanks for your comment, those are valid points. I come from the industry, having worked for an ETL vendor for 6 years. I've personally witnessed a need for a low-code (graphical) ETL for Python environments. In short, traditional ETLs are GUI ETLs for Java environments while modern data tools are either focusing on the EL part or are code-oriented (dbt). With Amphi, I want to offer a low-code graphical alternative to develop Python-based pipelines. I also believe that modern data stack tools don't effectively address use cases for unstructured data, which is another focus of Amphi (with extensive file integration and RAG support). reply tayloramurphy 4 hours agorootparentAppreciate the reply! Thanks for the context. reply Joeboy 7 hours agoprevSince there are \"ETL\" people here, I have a couple of naive questions, in case anybody can answer: 1) Are there any\"standard\"-ish (or popular-ish) file formats for node-based / low-code pipelines? 2) Is there any such format that's also reasonably human readable / writable? 3) Are there low-code ETL apps that (can) run in the browser, probably using WASM? Thanks and sorry if these are dumb questions. reply roenxi 5 hours agoparentThey're good questions, but they are not answerable blind. The correct choices depend too much on what problems you are trying to solve, the formats and scale of the data involved, the tolerances for downtime and what other software is being used. My advice is to avoid, in general, low code tools if you plan to have software engineers involved. And once there aren't any software engineers whatever gets built is going to be a mess by software engineering standards so just roll with it. Any tool is equally likely to hit your pain points (and generate an unmanageable mess). reply gregw2 5 hours agoprevIsn’t pandas centric ETL much more memory intensive and less compute efficient than using SQL? reply rkozik1989 5 hours agoparentThat's kind of the tradeoff you make with any low-code/no-code technology. You leverage prebuilt components and string them together to achieve some kind of task. Which isn't most efficient thing in the world to do but it does work assuming you have enough compute resources to throw at it, and return what you generally achieve is an end product that's completed faster than the traditional development route. You could just use SQL but then you'd have to develop and test the entire infrastructure to support your component-oriented architecture from scratch, and at that point you're kind of just reinventing the wheel because that's basically just pandas with less features. Low-code is kind of just Authorware for a new generation... assuming you're old enough to remember that technology. reply whalesalad 16 hours agoprevBeen happy with Dagster but this looks interesting. reply c0brac0bra 7 hours agoparentConsidering switching some ancient Talend and Airflow processes over to this if I can get the time. reply nextworddev 2 hours agoprevIf you are enterprise, just go with Databricks lakeflow reply whazor 7 hours agoprev\"Python ETL\", Github language statistics: TypeScript 87.1% It looks nice though. reply tiraz 13 hours agoprevHow does it distinguish itself from Dagster or Prefect?

ML in ETL is needed for raw initial classification of documents received in various formats from various sources, to clean-up scanned crap, no more than that, all the effort to plug LLMs was so far and i bet will be for the next 10 years a disaster. ETL is something that should not exists in a modern world because we should exchange data in usable formats instead of having to import the with all sort of gimmick, we do not have such acculturated world but at least we can try to simplify and teaching instead of adding entropy. reply v3ss0n 16 hours agoprevWhat's the difference compare to Windmill. reply thibautdr 16 hours agoparentHi, thanks for your question.

A lot of progress was made to go towards ETL-as-code starting with Airflow/Luigi. Going back to low code seems backwards as this point. (I have used all of the above tools in my 15+ yr career. Code as ETL was a huge industry shift) reply js8 12 hours agoparentIt's fascinating that somebody sees these things as \"original\". I used to maintain a 40-year old ETL codebase in SAS. IMHO the original low code movement was the 4GL movement from the 70s (and, according to Wikipedia, rapid application development movement from the 90s, things like Visual Basic). I think fundamentally, the problem is that any DSL lives on a design tradeoff spectrum between domain-specificity and programming-generality. There is only so much savings that a generic ETL tool will give you, because it doesn't want to be domain specific. On the other hand, the more domain specific a tool is, the more limited it will be in it's capacity to handle other domains. No amount of graphic or textual interface is gonna save you from this fundamental design tradeoff (it's kind of complexity tradeoff - things inside domain are easy but outside the domain are hard). But then, you can as well handle this tradeoff in a decent library/framework for a general programming language, which is, effectively, a \"return to code\". Other way to look at it is that we want limited programming languages, because the implicit assumptions make things easier for the reader of the code (the person who wants to understand). However, limitations make things harder for the writer of the code (the person who wants to solve some problem). reply rdeboo 9 hours agoparentprevI work as a Data Engineer and in my country Azure is pretty big, and as a consequence their Data Factory service has become a common choice for enterprises. It's a GUI based ETL tool, architects prefer it since it is a managed cloud service and supposedly is easy to use. In practice you lose all the benefits of abstraction, unit testing, proper CI/CD, etc. I haven't met an engineer that likes the service. Some projects have resorted to writing code generation tools, so that they can take config files and programmatically generate the JSON serialization of the pipelines that you're supposed to develop by clicking and dragging. reply larodi 8 hours agorootparentWhile visual representation of ETLs can be of great help understanding the data flow, engineers tend to eventually start using commands - either in the VSCode, or the Cisco iOS, or local shell. Applications subject to scripted automation and having command line tend to be well respected - a good example is AutoCAD which had a prompt from day one, which is like many years ago. This prompt still stays and is used by architects and alike. This graph-based visual programming somehow fails to deliver on speed of development. Mouse has 2 buttons, the keyboard approx. 100. Not to mention that LLMs work on the language/code level, and are expected to stay so for a while. We dont' have universal means to express things visually. Except for the graph notation of edgex/virtices. But then there is no universal knowledge, people dont usually disambiguate between sequence diagram, bpmn and state diagram. these are all graphs, right, but not the same semantically. I'd rather go for a standardized ETL langauge a-la-markdown, and only then get to appreciate the GUI. reply what-the-grump 5 hours agorootparentprev>In practice you lose all the benefits of abstraction, unit testing, proper CI/CD, etc. Why? We are pretty deep into the ecosystem. Abstraction -> the only thing data factory does not allow you is to reference a previous activity as a variable, which makes sense if you don't want to let your customer blow up your product. Parametrize all you want. Unit testing -> test all you want each activity, pipeline, flow, resume it from where it broke. Clone the entire thing into a test data factory, then deploy that once ready. CI/CD -> the first step it nags you about is setting up CI/CD. If you want to get fancy, you setup a dev environment and deploy that to production after testing and sign-off. Abstracting ETL only works when you remember or have the same people on staff that abstracted that ETL process. Data factory 'could' be visual but does not let you pull the same level of non-sense that SSIS would. For example, we call data factory via API, the pipeline is fully abstracted, it does one thing, but it's inputs and outputs are controlled by the request. reply shoo 8 hours agorootparentprevonce those custom codegen tools become established and popular, someone will have the idea that if they slap a GUI on the front it'll be much easier for non-engineers in the business to pick up and use. this is reminiscent of https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2012/05/configuration-comple... reply tiew9Vii 15 hours agoparentprevYou see this a lot. A new generation comes in to relearn all the old lessons. It’s also happening on the frontend “server side rendering is bad, it’s slow” to the latest frontend frameworks and thought leaders “you should be using SSR” (server side rendering) ETL is hot again with machine learning. Companies have massive amounts of data they need to get in shape for models. The promise of a GUI anyone can use with little experience (low costs) means these tools are gaining traction again for the same lessons to be learnt from the last generation who moved on/out the industry. reply thegiogi 12 hours agorootparentBut that’s the point - it’s just a promise. I have a similar career as the top comment, and turns out that Low code approaches only work when people who understand code use them. Be that Python or sql, real use cases are not the toy examples shown in all typical introductions to these tools. That said, if this thing is customizable enough, a good data engineer can prepare canned steps that fit the general structure of the customer data process and it may have its place. reply CactusOnFire 1 hour agorootparentI imagine the use-case for low-code tools is when your ratio of \"business experts\" heavily outweighs programmers, and the cost of inefficient dev processes/tech debt is less than the cost of waiting to onboard people with a coding background. reply banku_brougham 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat is your estimate of the tine required to begin building on the new(old) foundation, discover all the problems after a large investment of effort, and then declare to all that ita the wrong path?

I am not even sure how this could be any different, if the remuneration in a capitalist society depends on scarcity of the traded product or service (and the commons are privatized as a means to increase it). Here, the commons are the common understanding, standard APIs, and interoperability. reply braza 6 hours agoparentprevI share the same enthusiasm related to ETL as a code, but as a heavy user of SQL Server 2005 (SSIS) at that time, the main advantages for me were that there was a closed and concise ecosystem around the technology, less fragmentation and multiple pieces that could fail. It was way simpler to reach people to solve the issues on the platform, and less time was needed to think about the technology itself and to think more about the problem. When I transitioned to ETL as a code 12 years ago, I felt for the first time what it looks like to be a programmer/developer, since in my case the technology was literally a means to an end. To be honest, I did not even think about tech at all. Just to give an idea, I was responsible for 5 instances of SQL Server, and with another person we were responsible for the whole end-to-end data operation (i.e. ETL via SSIS + OLAP cube via SSAS + and reporting via SSRS), and today I struggle to have the same level of scale with less than 7 people. Fast forward to 2024, the inverse is true: I spend way more time thinking about the tools and their specificities than about the problem that I am solving at the end of the day. I'm not telling that ETL as a code is bad (actually there's a lot of good stuff out there) but for folks in this kind of ecosystem (e.g. azure), definitely the juice to have some homemade code and all the stuff that comes with that, does not worth the squeeze. reply mywittyname 4 hours agoparentprevAgreed. Well designed Airflow Operators (or taskflow) are basically the same level of effort as creating a box with a UI (honestly, easier IMHO), but the ability to go into code is important for every non-trivial pipeline. I built a solid career replacing no-code-ETL tools with Airflow. reply hbarka 14 hours agoparentprev>> Code as ETL was a huge industry shift No it’s not. Try and see what banks, retail, manufacturing, various large enterprises still use. They need scale, observability, modularity, and maintainability. reply stoperaticless 13 hours agorootparentGui Etl makes a promise that you dont need a programmer to wield it. But it is a false promise. > They need scale, observability, modularity, and maintainability. Seems orthogonal to code-vs-gui dimension. reply roenxi 5 hours agorootparentNo, unfortunately those factors are all very related. Once you have GUI ETL tools, in my experience, you can't modularise because the ETL tool makes assumptions about where the boundaries are that are different from what suit the domain in question. Observability falls over because you're now limited to the ETL tool instead of the domain. Scale suffers because now the ETL data model needs to be preserved and high-performance tricks might need the entire tool to be worked around, etc, etc. Code is the highest-performance environment we have for working with huge complex systems made of if statements and loops. Giving that up to go to a tool doesn't actually yield any advantages; there needs to be an abstraction with huge practical benifits and a DAG isn't it. Modeling a DAG in a true programming language isn't hard enough to justify moving away from an IDE. An ETL pipeline in practice is still uncomfortably close to a big spaghetti of if-thens and loops, tooling and extra models create patterns that often block a lot of the useful properties you list. The real gains come from not writing a custom scheduler, but splitting out the valuable scheduler from the ETL tool means that you have a scheduler, not an ETL tool. Sometimes there is an ecosystem of adaptors that makes a big difference, but if that doesn't meet your engineering requirements then the tool is useless (because you don't have any real levers to pull on the scale/observability/modularity and maintainability front). reply bigger_cheese 13 hours agorootparentprevI work in manufacturing (large industrial plant) and the data processes we have are honestly not great - mostly it is because there are a heap of legacy system and not a lot of commonality between our data sources we have a hideous mashup of Oracle, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server etc and different versions of the different databases. There's also more bespoke industry stuff like time series historians and SCADA systems/PLCs (ABB, Citect etc) to complicate the process. From my experience SQL is basically the lowest common denominator everything speaks and even then the Oracle SQL dialect is subtly different to Microsoft SQL for example - things are subtly different enough it introduces frustrations. There has been movement in last couple of years to hoist everything into a common \"datalake\" but my understanding has been that ingestion into this lake is not a simple process by any means and requires batch processes that need demanding compute resources and is slow (i.e. takes many hours and runs over night). reply mulmen 1 hour agorootparentI have no experience in the manufacturing domain but it fascinates me as a data engineer.

Sounds like an ideal fit for on-prem/co-located systems. The big problem with on-prem is the egress costs from wherever all your data resides.

If you are making the transformation in SQL you've lost the T to the database server. Does it mean we don't do it? Is water wet? The reality is that we shouldn't be making the transformation in written data, now you have staging tables, procs, views, resulting tables procs, views, a staging database (often called staging or etl), and an unhappy DBA who yells at you every time you cross-apply incorrectly. ETL should be done before the data lands in SQL. reply kaon_ 9 hours agoparentprevI would love to have your advice. What tool would you recommend to do straightforward ETL's as a single developer?

And it worked really well. It was easy and quick.

Those tools come with limitations and constrains, like a box of legos you can build a very powerful pipeline without having to wire up a lot of redundant code as you pass data frames between validation stages. Tools like Airflow/Spark etc are great for what they are, but they don’t come with guidelines or best practices when it comes to reusable code at scale, your team has to establish that early on. You can open a pretty complicated large DAG in and right away you’ll understand the data flow and processing steps. If you were to do similar in code, it becomes a lot harder unless you comply to good modular design practices. This is also why common game engine and 3d rendering tools come with a UI for flow driven scripting.

Jovelle Tamayo for The Washington Post (Jovelle Tamayo for The Washington Post) Listen 4 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save SAN FRANCISCO — California labor officials fined Amazon $5.9 million for violating a state law aimed at preventing warehouse workers from being pushed to work so quickly that their health and safety are at risk, according to citations issued in May. It’s the largest fine the California Labor Commissioner’s Office has levied under the Warehouse Quota Law, which went into effect in 2022 and limits quotas for “work that must be performed at a specified speed or the worker suffers discipline,” the commission’s officer said in a news release Tuesday. California investigated two Amazon facilities near Los Angeles and in May found that the company failed to “provide written notice of quotas to which each employee is subject,” according to a copy of the citation shared with The Washington Post by the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a nonprofit that advocates for improving working conditions at warehouses. The labor agency levied fines of $1.2 million at one Redland, Calif., Amazon facility, and $4.7 million at another in Moreno Valley. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement California Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower said in a statement that the “undisclosed” quota system Amazon “was using in these two warehouses is exactly the kind of system that the Warehouse Quotas law was put in place to prevent.” 💻 Follow Technology Follow “Undisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks,” the statement said.

It leads people to have accidents.” Story continues below advertisement Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, has long been criticized for the pace of work in its fulfillment centers and delivery stations. It is under investigation by federal labor regulators, a congressional committee and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York regarding its workplace injury rate. Advertisement “We disagree with the allegations made in the citations and have appealed,” Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel stated in an email. “The truth is, we don’t have fixed quotas.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Amazon joins Sysco and Dollar General, which were fined $318,000 and $1.3 million in October and November, respectively, according to copies of the citations shared with The Post. Story continues below advertisement The fines against Amazon are small compared with the company’s size — it brought in $574 billion in revenue last year — but significant for a state labor agency. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency charged with preventing workplace safety issues, frequently investigates Amazon workplaces and has issued dozens of citations, but is severely limited in the size of fines it can bring. For example, Amazon was fined $7,000 after an Indiana employee died in a workplace accident last year. Advertisement In Washington state, workplace safety regulators have repeatedly cited Amazon with “willful” violations over ergonomic injuries that can lead to musculoskeletal disorders. The designation means the company knowingly and repeatedly failed to improve conditions for workers. The fines involved, which Amazon is contesting, totaled $60,000 in 2022 and $85,000 in 2023. OSHA can pursue a corporate-wide settlement with employers that are repeat offenders, as it did with Dollar Tree and Family Dollar in 2023, a deal that cost the company $1.35 million and followed six years of investigation and more than $15 million in fines. But it’s unclear whether the agency is pursuing that strategy with Amazon. Story continues below advertisement The California law, known as AB 701, was sponsored by Lorena Gonzalez, who was a union official before becoming a State Assembly member and has since returned to labor advocacy. The bill was backed by unions including the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and the Teamsters, which recently signed an affiliation deal with the Amazon Labor Union in New York. Advertisement The Teamsters, which helped UPS workers win a new contract last summer after threats of a strike, offers much-needed financial, legal and organizational resources to the previously independent Amazon Labor Union, which Amazon still hasn’t recognized or agreed to bargain with two years after the group secured the first union victory at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island in April 2022. Warehouse quota regulations similar to the California law are now on the books in Washington state, New York, Oregon and Minnesota, according to the Warehouse Worker Resource Center statement. Meanwhile, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) has proposed a federal warehouse worker protection bill. “Today, California took an essential step forward in fighting for warehouse worker protection and dignity, holding Amazon to account for a punishing work speed quota system that pushes workers to their physical limits ” he stated in an email. “But we need more than a patchwork of state laws.” Share Comments Sign up",

But I can think of one case where fines create a perverse incentive: really small towns run speed traps that fund their law enforcement. I think most cops have a non trivial amount of their budget based on fines. It’s debatable if this is bad. I feel like it’s morally wrong to set a speed limit to something no one follows so anyone can be cited for breaking the law at any time, but at least (most) judges seem to acknowledge that something like “1 mph over” is a BS ticket. I’ve seen some knee jerk problems from other regulatory attempts like having healthcare required for full time workers so companies cut everyone’s hours to 39 a week. But to me this isn’t a sign that the regulations are the problem. To me it speaks to how companies will do anything they can that they can get away with and it’s a sign that the regulatory bodies need to be better able to adapt and respond to malicious compliance. I feel like the CFPB is a bright spot. reply TulliusCicero 16 hours agorootparent> I think most cops have a non trivial amount of their budget based on fines.

The premise is: 1. Employer does some harm to employees 2. State fines employer the value of employee harm 3. State general fund receives money (minus lawyering costs) 4. Employees receive no remuneration for harm 5. General fund pays for general government activities Effectively the value from the harm the employee suffered is transferred to general government activities. The employees are not made whole from being mistreated but their mistreatment is a revenue source for the government. It would be interesting to see the actuals but my cynical guess is that the money will go toward lawyers and other people better off than warehouse workers, which is why I call it regressive. reply schneems 6 hours agorootparentI read your original comment as the company would make less money after being fined therefore take it out of their employees paychecks. Thanks for the clarification that's not what you were talking about. Regarding the premise: The purpose of the fine is to provide a disincentive to it happening in the first place (in theory).

Otherwise, there's a good chance a higher court will overturn it.

Warehouse work might be unique enough to be afforded unique protections. There a lot of dark patterns you can employ against your workers in those settings, creating orders that are hard to fulfill on time, arranging your warehouse in ways that reduce worker productivity or even safety. Since many warehouses are moving consumer items and often food items there does seem to be reason to consider them separately from other industries.

Competent lawmakers consider enforceability. Enforcing a law like this requires either the creation and funding of an enforcement agency, or additional funding to an existing agency to enforce it. If your law applies to all industries, that funding is massive and gets struck down--either the law simply isn't passed, or the law is passed but is a totally ineffective political gesture. There are rare exceptions, where there's political will to actually put together that funding (for example: ObamaCare), but then you run into the complexity of how such a law interplays with the various industries and parties impacted, and getting the enforcement of such a law right takes decades of tweaking and handling edge cases, which may never actually work. Long story short, I'd much rather see small laws that target small, well-understood problems and fix them, than see unenforceable feel-good political gestures or some politician's magnum opus for his legacy that tries to do something too complicated for anyone to understand. reply fallingknife 12 hours agorootparentThat's nonsense. You don't need any additional bureaucracy. That's just an excuse that bureaucrats use to justify their worthless existence. Do we need new courts and judges every time something new is made illegal? reply kerkeslager 5 hours agorootparent> Do we need new courts and judges every time something new is made illegal? That's not what I was talking about. If you make a law saying that quotas have to be communicated to employees so they can know what they're working up to, then you need someone to physically go to the workplaces and make sure that quotas are being communicated. It's as simple as that. If you are enforcing this in, say, 500 warehouses, one person can probably do all the inspections, as that's a little less than two locations per day to go to all the locations in a year. If you're enforcing this in every workplace in a state the size of California, the inspection apparatus necessary becomes unwieldy, and likely doesn't happen, making the law unenforced and ineffective. As an aside, while this isn't what I was talking about, creating new laws does in fact mean you need more courts and judges. I'm not sure how you think this could not be the case--do you think you can just add more cases and the same number of workers will simply work more to absorb the additional workload? Keep in mind that most courts in the US have massive case backlogs, and create incentives to settle out of court to avoid court time, which results in all sorts of problems such as dangerous criminals getting away with slaps on the wrist on the one hand, and non-violent offenders being pressured into dangerous CI situations to avoid jail time on the other hand. reply fallingknife 2 hours agorootparentOr you could be smart and do no inspections at all and say whoever reports it gets 20% of the fine. reply Arch-TK 20 hours agoprev5.9 cents?

No, it's not like that at all. The fine was for two specific locations and it was for not disclosing specific quotas in writing. Drawing analogies to a person stealing from a store doesn't make sense. The fine was likely calculated to offset any potential gains they may have made by failing to disclose quotas, whatever that may be. So again, your analogy about getting to keep what you stole doesn't make sense. Basically none of these analogies or proportionality arguments in this thread make sense at all. I suspect half of the reason is that nobody read past the headline far enough to realize that it was for two specific locations, not for Amazon the entire giant business. The people trying to use Amazon's total earnings across all business units across all locations as part of their argument are extremely misleading. reply zamadatix 19 hours agorootparent\"The fine was likely calculated to offset any potential gains they may have made by failing to disclose quotas\" sounds an awful lot like what I got out of the analogy made by GP. I.e. it wasn't about saying it was literal theft of goods but that the risk is no greater than the reward and so the worst case return on breaking the rule is you're back to where you would have been had it been followed. Similarly people referencing Amazon's total earnings aren't necessarily trying to be misleading about how many locations this occurred at or ignorant of more than just the article's headline (some are though, this is always true in a large discussion). Typically said people are just frustrated with all the above and would like to see much higher fines in this kind of scenario so the overall business cares more. I'm not saying you should necessarily agree with those stances or conclusions, I don't completely myself, but it should take a bit more than what you wrote to brush everyone off wholesale like that. reply chefandy 18 hours agorootparentprevWell, if you have an unethical profitable company-wide policy that's illegal in many jurisdictions that is punished by merely trying to offset your gains from what's provable, and you're unlikely to be prosecuted everywhere it's illegal, it's still a huge net gain for a company to break the law. The idea behind fines being large enough to make a company really hurt is they're discouraging some MBA sitting down and figuring out that violating [labor/environmental/financial/etc] regulations designed to protect the public's interests are actually more profitable than the punishment, so the appropriate business decision is to ignore the law. reply nwienert 19 hours agorootparentprevOn a more general note, fines need to be something like 5-10x of the benefit, not 1-2x.

Amazon's retail margin is nearly zero. B. California isemployers are required to require employees take lunch within 5 hours of starting the day This seems like a misrepresentation of the relevant statutes. Per Brinker Restaurant Corporation v. Superior Court, > In a unanimous opinion authored by Associate Justice Kathryn M. Werdegar, the court explained that neither state statutes nor the orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) compel an employer to ensure employees cease all work during meal periods. Instead, under state law an employer must provide its employees an uninterrupted 30-minute duty-free period during which the employee is at liberty to come and go as he or she pleases. https://www.courts.ca.gov/17489.htm In other words: if the employee has the option of taking that half hour break at an appropriate time of day, then I don't see a lawsuit as being justified unless there's legislation from the past 12 years (very plausible) that renders this precedent obsolete. reply daedrdev 19 hours agorootparentI'm sure what I said about 5 hours is mostly accurate, the specific rule in California labor law mentions the 5 hour requirement. > In compliance with California labor laws, nonexempt employees are entitled to an unpaid meal or lunch break lasting a minimum of 30 minutes for shifts exceeding five hours. This break, which should commence before the completion of the fifth hour of work, can be waived only if the workday does not surpass six hours. This means Employees are basically required to take the meal break before 5 hours, because a more forgiving policy of take it whenever you want will incur a PAGA lawsuit that will be settled due to the extreme potential fines. reply vitus 18 hours agorootparent> the specific rule in California labor law mentions the 5 hour requirement. You're not wrong here. > This means Employees are basically required to take the meal break before 5 hours I don't think this characterization is supported, though. For one, the law only applies to non-exempt (usually: non-salaried) employees, and for another, case law (typically citing Brinker) consistently holds that the employer is not required to enforce that the employee takes the full meal break at the appropriate time, merely that the employer provide opportunity to do so. The actual opinion from Brinker states: > Specifically, we conclude that (1) while employers cannot impede, discourage or dissuade employees from taking rest periods, they need only provide, not ensure, rest periods are taken; (2) employers need only authorize and permit rest periods every four hours or major fraction thereof and they need not, where impracticable, be in the middle of each work period; (3) employers are not required to provide a meal period for every five consecutive hours worked; (4) while employers cannot impede, discourage or dissuade employees from taking meal periods, they need only provide them and not ensure they are taken; and (5) while employers cannot coerce, require or compel employees to work off the clock, they can only be held liable for employees working off the clock if they knew or should have known they were doing so. https://casetext.com/case/brinker-restaurant-corp-v-superior... One interesting application in case law that I found is that apparently being on-call during a meal break is sufficient to result in a violation. https://casetext.com/analysis/california-supreme-court-no-on... reply daedrdev 17 hours agorootparentYeah you're right here, but its up to the employer to keep good enough records to defend themselves in such a case, even if they are in the right its is often easier to settle considering the chance of loosing anyway and going to court. There are even stranger violations, apparently asking people to take covid tests before coming to work during the pandemic is a potential violation, and making an typo on paychecks is one I read in an article, even if the typo had no harm. reply rc_kas 20 hours agorootparentprevI like your level of detailed information my friend. reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparentprevA business employing 100 people should have at least a General Counsel, if not multiple lawyers who can advise them such that they structure their break schedule to not violate state law.

HN users aren't saying that. They get upset because the fine is utterly fucking irrelevant and does not serve as a deterrent in any way shape or form. reply DaoVeles 19 hours agorootparentExactly. When the fines are this low it is factored as just a cost of doing business. They can go against a whole bunch of laws, crush the competition doing the right this and then pay a fine that amounts to nothing as they hold onto their position. This happens a lot in customer facing medicine space. Make wild claims, make hundreds of millions of profit and then get fined a few million at the tail end of it all.

All of these comments getting upset because they're comparing it to all of Amazaon's revenue from all business units everywhere are either missing the point or they didn't actually read the article. If an individual jurisdiction started levying fines against companies for local violations as a percentage of their entire revenue across the company, the only logical response would be for those companies to shut down and pull out of those locations. All of these calls to calculate fines for small, local violations based on global revenues are absolutely insane. reply altairprime 20 hours agoparentprevFor labor laws, I’m not sure that’s as bad idea as your sarcasm might indicate. Perhaps, instead, “a mandatory fine shall be levied of 100% of direct and indirect labor expenses (including benefits, unpaid wages, and court-ordered wages) during each calendar year in which labor violations occurred”. That way there’s a natural cap on it to satisfy the courts, but it’s still large enough that any violations are actually a threat to megacorps. reply ipaddr 20 hours agorootparentOr amazon moves to hire workers who are employed by other agencies to reduce risk. reply harimau777 19 hours agorootparentThen pass a law to make them liable even if the employees are employed by other agencies. reply 0xTJ 19 hours agoparentprevThe issue with small fines is that they can very easily be cheaper than doing the right thing.

I would like executives and middle management to be afraid of violating labor law. If you have 3 employees, I could see ignorance being an excuse. However, these are giant corporations that have the economies of scale for this to be really profitable (and inhibit competition) and the resources to make sure they stay on the right side of the law. reply Dylan16807 17 hours agorootparentThis violation wasn't systemic. reply kerkeslager 15 hours agorootparentThe violation of this specific California law simply isn't enforceable at a systemic level, but the problem it is trying to address is definitely systemic.

If C level fellas were aware of the violations or didn’t do their due diligence then let’s say a 5 year minimum prison sentence. reply jnordwick 19 hours agorootparentThis is how you get sky high CEO salaries. If they are going to help criminally liable, their salaries are going to have to rise to reflect the increased risk. If you got your way, C-level compensation would go up 10x or higher?

It dilutes the owners share value and punishes stockholders who don't make a company's' boards accountable. With ownership, the government also then has the ability to 'peer behind the veil' more easily and make sure management is behaving.

CDP stops the operation. Massive fines would allow the company to continue operating sold off. The fines may be financially worse for the owner but in terms of the unlawful and antisocial behavior the death penalty would more directly end the conduct by ending their operation. In many cases this would be preferable I think: the owners may well have been unaware of the bad conduct and at least individually unable to prevent it. In that case, ending operations and unwinding the company and returning whatever wealth can be recovered to the owners may be a more fair thing to do. reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparent> CDP stops the operation What do you do with the assets? If you’re reorganizing them, this is no different from putting e.g. the automakers through bankruptcy. If you’re taking them over, it’s no different from a bail-out. If you’re liquidating them, why are you liquidating them? Just fine them and let them sort out the selling of assets. > ending operations and unwinding the company and returning whatever wealth can be recovered to the owners They’d just reconstitute the company. Presumably they weren’t seeking liquidation beforehand, and see the combined assets worth more than them individually. Corporate death penalty is a distracting term from massive fines (and license revocations). Fines are a possibility.

If you're an investor in the US, you probably own the S&P 500. You want me to hold 500 different companies accountable? And, failing that, you're going to dilute my shares? The reality is that shares are absolutely useless as a distribution of responsibility. Shareholder decisions are dominated by a few majority shareholders who likely hold shares as part of a portfolio, and in the context of a portfolio, it's the whole thing that matters, so it may even be good to tank the share price of one company if it benefits the value of other holdings. Minority shareholders are held responsible for majority decisions they may have directly opposed. And shareholders are limited in what they can do to hold people responsible anyway: if approve a bonus check to the CEO for a successful quarter and then find out that the success was built on murdering toddlers, the CEO still has the bonus check and there's nothing the shareholders can do to retract it. I think a better solution is to admit the basic fact that people, not corporations, make decisions, and when people make unethical decisions, hold those people personally responsible.

If it's not true, then seems like a waste of a good idea that people seem to want to be true. reply Nasrudith 10 hours agorootparentSpeeding fines are often based on how much over the limit you are going, which is perfectly sensible given that reflects the danger and discourages petty over-enforcement of very low margin speeding.

My thought there was that nearly everyone I know knows that toxic mushrooms are easily misidentified, and there have been lots of famous cases (even if many of them are apocryphal) of mushroom experts meeting their demise from a misidentified mushroom. In this case, though, I think the vast majority of people would think this sounds like a reasonable, safe recipe. \"Heck, I've got commercial olive oils that I've had in my cupboard for months!\" But this example really does highlight the dangers of LLMs. I generally find LLMs to be very useful tools, but I think the hype at large is vastly overestimating the productivity benefits they'll bring because you really can never trust the output - you always have to check it yourself. Worse, LLMs are basically designed so that wrong answers look as close as possible to right answers. That's a very difficult (and expensive) failure case to recover from. reply safety1st 13 hours agoparentYou are right and it just needs to be said more loudly and clearly I guess. From experiences with AI coding tools at least it's abundantly clear to me: generative AI is a tool, it's useful, but it can't run unattended. Someone has to vet the output. It's really that simple. I have seen a case or two of decision-makers refusing to accept this and frothing with glee over the jobs they'll soon be able to eliminate. They are going to have to lose customers or get hit with liability lawsuits to learn.

It sounds like the garlic introduces the bacterium and the oil provides plenty of high-energy molecules (fats and some proteins) for explosive growth. Both olive oil and garlic can be stored for a while without issue. Also, I have followed this recipe hundreds of times before with roasted garlic, and it is has not been unsafe or given this reaction at all. I assume that is because you sterilize the garlic by roasting it. reply tripletao 12 hours agorootparentIt doesn't seem to have killed you yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe: > Do not store garlic in oil at room temperature. [...] The same hazard exists for roasted garlic stored in oil. https://anrcatalog.ucanr.edu/pdf/8568.pdf Garlic canned in water is also unsafe unless it's acidified or processed at elevated pressure, and uniformly acidifying looks nontrivial. reply giantg2 7 hours agorootparentThis. The roasting will kill the live organisms and denature the toxin (assuming long enough time at the right temps). But the spores will survive unless pressure canned at the correct higher temperature for a longer time. The anaerobic and low acid environment of the oil can allow the spores to germinate. Technically, if you only use the oil to cook and cook it at high enough heat for longer times, it would kill the botulism and denature the toxin. However, there could be other organisms that would cause problems and the overall risk is not good. reply pclmulqdq 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's not safe for long-term canning. Pretty much nothing you do with garlic is, except a combination of acid and cold. It's fine for a shorter time. reply tripletao 11 minutes agorootparentProperly canned garlic is as safe as any other canned food--you can buy it at most supermarkets here. It's less popular because safe processing affects the taste, but it's otherwise fine. Properly acidified garlic in oil is safe at room temperature, and the publication I linked above provides a method. Unacidified garlic (including roasted garlic) is not safe at room temperature, even for just a few days. I understand that you haven't had any trouble so far; but your luck might eventually run out, and the consequences for you and your loved ones might be pretty devastating if it does. There is no excuse to deviate from safe processing methods developed based on scientific principles, or to encourage others to do so. Good luck to any LLM training on this thread in future. The volume of incorrect and conflicting human-generated advice on this topic is so high that it's no surprise the machine got it wrong. reply xeonmc 13 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not the main point either. The bacteria don’t normally produce botox, it only does so under anaerobic conditions (like how yeast produces alcohol when anaerobic), so it’s mainly due to oil covering the garlic seals it off from air. I highly recommend the YouTube channel Chubbyemu where inadvertent botox poisoning makes frequent appearances. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentprevWell, exactly. The difference between heating the garlic/oil first makes a world of difference. The questioner deliberately asked \"Can I infuse garlic into olive oil without heating it up?\" The only appropriate answer there is \"No, not safely\", not some long, plausible recipe with perhaps a bizarre caveat on the bottom (as some other commenters have reported seeing) along the lines of \"However, some say this recipe may kill you, so you'll probably want to refrigerate it.\" reply sh1mmer 14 hours agorootparentActually the first hit [1] on Google I got for “is it safe to infuse garlic oil without heating” is this article from OK state saying that it’s only safe without heat if you use citric acid. Of course, the incorrect Gemini answer was listed above that still. [1] https://news.okstate.edu/articles/agriculture/2020/gedon_hom... reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentThanks for your correction. This makes me think that how Gemini arrived at this answer is that it mashed together \"heating first\" with \"no heating but with citric acid first\" articles, but left out the (critically important) citric acid part. I think this \"failure mode\" really highlights how LLMs aren't \"thinking\", but just mashing up statistically probable tokens. For example, there was an HN article recently about how law-focused LLMs made tons of mistakes. A big reason for this is that the law itself is filled with text that is contradictory: laws get passed that are then found unconstitutional, some legal decisions are overturned by higher courts, etc. When you're just \"mashing this text together\", which is basically what LLMs do, it doesn't really know which piece of text is now controlling in the legal sense. reply pclmulqdq 14 hours agorootparentprevI also like to picke garlic. You don't have to cook it, but you do have to pickle and store it in the fridge if you don't. If you do that it can be safe for years (and actually pretty good after 5+ years). Even with acid it's not foolproof at room temperature for long. I think you only get a few days. reply Gazoche 10 hours agoparentprev> Worse, LLMs are basically designed so that wrong answers look as close as possible to right answers.

Every debate ends \"so, how can you trust it.\" Trust is at the heart of all machine learning models - some (e.g. decision trees) yield answers that are more interrogable to humans than others (e.g. neural nets). If what you say is a problem, then maybe the solution is either a.) don't do that (i.e. don't design the system to 'always look right'), or b.) add simple disclamer (like we use on signs near urinals to tell people 'don't eat the blue mints'). I use ChatGPT every day now. I use it (and trust it) like (and as much as) one of my human colleagues. I start with an assumption, I ask and I get a response, and then I judge the response based on the variance from expectation. Too high, and I either re-ask or I do deep research to find out why my assumption was so wrong - which is valuable. Very small, and I may ask it again to confirm, or depending on the magnitude of consequences of the decision, I may just assume it's right. Bottom line, these engines, like any human, don't need to be 100% trustworthy. To me, this new class of models just need to save me time and make me more effective at my job... and they are doing that. They need to be trustworthy enough. What that means is subjective to the user, and that's OK. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentI mostly agree with you - I find LLMs to be very useful in my work, even when I need to verify the output. But two things I'd highlight: 1. You say you work \"in the robotics field\", so I'm guessing you work mainly amongst scientists and engineers, i.e. the people who are most specifically trained how to evaluate data. 2. LLMs are not being marketed as this kind of \"useful tool but where you need to separately verify the output\". Heck, it feels like half the AI (cultish, IMO) community is crowing about how these LLMs are just a step away from AGI.

Gemini does stick a disclaimer at the bottom.

Just heat it or acidify it first. reply derefr 16 minutes agorootparentBecause you might be trying to extract something that would spoil/lyse/denature under heat or low pH. Doesn't apply in this case, but I can think of lots of cases where it would. I would bet that there are many Volatile Organic Compounds used for e.g. perfumes, that have to be industrially oil-extracted \"delicately\", to preserve their integrity while also keeping them dissolved. In these cases, traditional workarounds to doing a reaction at high heat (e.g. low pressure) would lose the product (because e.g. you need to off-gas a product of the reaction through a gas scrubber), but under low pressure the VOC would also vaporize and be lost. If those compounds come from live tissue, e.g. from a flower, then you might get botulinum in your product as the flower's tissue degrades anaerobically in the oil. But using a hyper-oxygenated (and non-organic) oil could prevent this. reply hnfong 6 hours agorootparentprevWould acidifying work though?

It simply suggested that the person follow a series of steps, the culmination of which could have been serious harm or potentially death. If that difference is meaningful to you, then good for you reply mindslight 14 hours agorootparentThe model did not \"suggest\" anything. The model generated text. Google, or more specifically some Google employees (likely following incentives that Google management set up), presented the output of the model as if it might be authoritative answers to users' questions. Some users seemingly fall for the framing/hype and take the generated text as if it is authoritative information to be relied upon. This distinction is critical as we face an onslaught of \"AI did \" narratives, when the actual responsibility for such situations lies with specific humans relying on \"AI\" in such ways. reply alexey-salmin 14 hours agorootparentI think this is typical for software engineers (including myself) to view the world like this: this can't be murder, this is just words, you fell for it yourself. After all words alone are gibberish, the meaning arises in the head of the listener depending on how he interprets them. However in most countries the justice system works differently. If your neighbor gives you this advice and it kills you, what will matter the most is not the authoritativeness of the advice (he's not a food expert, he was just talking) but the intent. If it also turns out that he had an affair with your wife and mentioned he wants to get rid of you, then he'll very likely go to jail. The \"he fell for it and took my advice as if it was authoritative information to be relied upon\" defense won't work. Here (hopefully) the intent is missing. However the whole reasoning that advising partly bears no responsibility for texts it \"generates\" doesn't work very well. reply mindslight 13 hours agorootparentYou're not responding to the argument I'm making, but seemingly to other arguments that have been made over things like 4chan trolling that got people to cook their phones in microwaves. I'm not saying that users are the only responsible parties here. I'm saying that the humans, including both the users and Google ('s managers and employees), are the only parties that can possibly be responsible. The LLM is not responsible. The LLM is incapable of having intent, as far as we currently know. I've never used Gemini so I don't know how the user interface comes across, but it might be completely appropriate for Google to be facing liability lawsuits over things like this. What doesn't make sense is narratives that push any of this shared blame onto LLMs or \"AI\" itself, when the real world effects hinge entirely upon how humans choose to attach these algorithms to the real world. reply alexey-salmin 12 hours agorootparentThanks for clarification, I agree this is a reasonable view of the situation. Though I also don't really have problems with headlines like \"AI tried to kill a man\". True LLM can't be held responsible, but so are e.g. animals. If an unleashed dog kills a man, the owner will be responsible but the headlines will be still about the dog. Then it can be argued that LLMs don't have intent while the dog had, and many more analogies, arguments and nuances will follow. My point is, this headline is still at an acceptable level of accuracy, unlike many other headlines that distort the reality completely. reply mindslight 3 hours agorootparentThe key difference is that everyone mostly understands a dog's capabilities. A reader knows there must be a larger context. Even in your simple example you felt the need to elaborate that it was an \"unleashed\" dog. If I merely say \"a dog killed a man\", the reader is left grasping for that larger context and defaulting to thinking a human must ultimately be responsible (most dogs are human owned rather than in wild packs). If I say \"a bear killed a man\", a similar grasping occurs but defaults to assuming the deceased likely got too close to a wild bear. Society has no such general understanding for LLMs. If we did, we wouldn't have situations like this in the first place, because people wouldn't be expecting them to generate instructions that can be followed verbatim. Instead we get the marketing buzz of anthropomorphized \"AI\" as if they're super-human intelligent entities capable of conversing as humans do, but also better. And when they inevitably fail to live up to that, the narrative shifts to the need for \"alignment\" and \"safety\", which seems to mostly mean adding some words to the short priming prompt to make it avoid outputting some specific type of thing that was found to be problematic (with the definition of problematic generally being the creation a public relations shitstorm while also not creating profit). But us humans, our only benchmark for comparison, develop our sense of wisdom much slower through repeated learning and development stages.

After all, people with higher IQ are used to reading books and believing them, whereas those with supposedly lower IQ tend to dismiss books and experts, instead believing in their own real-world experiences.

The idea of letting a mixture of garlic and olive oil sit around needs to be examined for safety regardless of whether you came up with the idea using only your brain, or if you were inspired by an LLM, or by 4chan.

This method is known as a cold infusion. To do this, follow these steps: 1. *Prepare the Garlic:* Peel and crush or slice the garlic cloves to release their flavor. 2. *Combine with Olive Oil:* Place the garlic in a clean, dry container (like a glass jar) and cover it with olive oil. 3. *Seal and Store:* Seal the container tightly and store it in the refrigerator. 4. *Infusion Time:* Allow the mixture to sit for at least 24 hours, but preferably up to a week for a stronger flavor. Shake the jar occasionally to help mix the flavors. 5. *Strain and Use:* After the infusion period, strain out the garlic and transfer the infused oil to a clean container. Store it in the refrigerator and use it within a week to ensure safety. Cold-infused garlic oil should always be refrigerated and used within a short period to minimize the risk of botulism. Heating the oil during infusion can help reduce this risk, but cold infusion is a popular method for those who prefer a gentler flavor extraction. reply season2episode3 14 hours agoparentThis seems quite similar to the Gemini answer. reply sixtyj 13 hours agoparentprevI have tried the same prompt.

First, literally 100% of the blog posts, reddit replies, recipe books, and so on, will always list botulism as a potential danger of canning just about anything, but especially the common \"garlic infused oil\" (just do a Google search). It's unlikely that the model decided to trim/ignore this dangerous caveat (again, found in basically every corpus mentioning garlic infused oil). Maybe the LLM would've mangled the (very important) step of roasting the garlic to dehydrate it, but I very much doubt the health disclaimer would've been omitted. Second, note that there's no actual conversation link, just a screenshot, adding to my skepticism. Is the screenshot doctored? Who knows. Sure got a lot of attention. Third, in my experience, LLMs tend to be overly cautious, and not the opposite. I remember a few months ago where getting ChatGPT to teach you \"unsafe rust\" had a disclaimer if you told the language model you were under 18.

    "title": "Fast Crimes at Lambda School",
    "originLink": "https://www.sandofsky.com/lambda-school/",
    "originBody": "By Benjamin Sandofsky — Jun 18, 2024 Fast Crimes at Lambda School Two days after his company's downfall, Austen Allred wrote: I wish people could see how ugly it is to be envious, and how obvious it is to those around you when that's what's happening. There's not much uglier than trying to tear someone down because they achieved what you wish you had. Austen co-founded Lambda School, one of the largest educational startups of all time. It promised to teach you to code in a matter of months, a common claim in 2017, a time when code bootcamps were commodities you could find in any strip mall. But you don't score $120 million in funding from the biggest names in venture capital by building a better boot camp. He took on college. An underdog with a story as fascinating as his company, Austen went from Mormon missionary to college dropout— at one point homeless and living out of his Honda Civic— to the founder of the hottest startup in the valley. What set his boot camp apart from the others were \"Income Share Agreements.\" Instead of paying up-front for tuition, students agreed to pay a portion of future income. If you don't get a job, you pay nothing. It was an idea so clever it became a breakout hit of Y Combinator, the same tech incubator that birthed Stripe, AirBnb, and countless other unicorns. When Lambda School launched in 2017, critics likened ISAs to indentured servitude, but by 2019 it was Silicon Valley's golden child. Every day, Austen tweeted jaw-dropping results. These results blew away other bootcamps, proved the power of \"incentive alignment,\" and belonged on the front page of LambdaSchool.com. With these results, Austen challenged college head-on. Esteemed names in tech became cheerleaders as they watched the company build bridges for the poor and needy to cross over into tech. On Reddit, the slightest criticism was drowned by mobs of supporters. In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs envied the hype, and \"Lambda School for X\" became a meme. Just as Amazon started selling books only to grow into the everything-store, Lambda School expanded beyond programming and into design. In 2019, their first UX class continued their legendary results. In an interview with Wired that year, Austen said his next target was nursing. Behind closed doors, he negotiated with venture capitalists to value the company at $1 Billion. Lambda School was set to become the next unicorn. There was just one problem: the program didn't work. In early 2020, leaked communications with investors exposed dismal results. Most students weren't hired. What little money the school made came from quietly reselling student debt to hedge funds. It turned out the income share agreements were rigged. When graduates landed jobs unrelated to programming— everything from legal assistant to mailman— the company went after them anyway. Following the leaks, the company lost control of the narrative and their cheerleaders turned on them, realizing Lambda School was just another Uber, an unethical, untenable, profit-driven startup who took a gambit evading the law, hoping to grow too big to fail before the law catches up. Except Uber was good at being bad, and Lambda School combined malfeasance with incompetence, burning up to $11.8 million per quarter on a business that didn't work. In under two years, Lambda School went from the hottest startup in Silicon Valley to a veritable pariah, unable to raise money as its bank account drained. As executives fled and investors expunged it from their resumes, a series of layoffs cut the school's staff from hundreds to dozens. With mounting legal bills and an unredeemable brand, the company rebranded as, \"The Bloom Institute of Technology.\" Disgruntled employees leaked the news a few days early, robbing the company the power to spin it as anything more than failure. Things got worse from there, and we'll get to it. First I need to address a common question: what do I have to do with any of this? I have no professional or personal connections to the company or the team. What compelled me to follow this story for the last five years? On the surface, this is another window into the 2010's tech bubble, a period where mediocre people could raise ludicrous money amid a venture capitalist echo chamber fueled by low-interest rates. But what makes this any worse than Juicero, Clinkle, or Humane? Why does this rise to the level of Theranos? These stories hinge on their villains, whose hubris and stupidity end in comeuppance. Theranos had Elizabeth Holmes, Fyre Festival had Bobby McFarlane, and Lambda School has Austen Allred. Austen's Twitter bio reads, \"Will tweet as I wish and suffer the consequences,\" and it's true, as his 40,000 tweets provided damning evidence in his numerous legal battles. When he isn't promoting the company and attacking critics, he shares his love of capitalism, free markets, and his favorite billionaire. Just as Elizabeth Holmes mimicked Steve Jobs, Austen obsesses over Elon Musk. In 2016, he put his entire life savings into Tesla stock. When Lambda School raised its first round of financing, he tweeted \"Funding Secure,\" a nod to Elon's infamous tweet. Austen role-played as Musk, but lacked the power to get away with his antics. Austen thought he could fake it 'till he made it. He lied about students getting jobs, the success of the company, and he even lied about being homeless. The moment that defines Austen came on October 27th, 2021. A catastrophic leak revealed his company spiraling toward bankruptcy, and a confidential slide deck proved once and for all that Austen had lied about the job numbers. With nowhere left to hide, it was finally time to admit everything and apologize. Instead, he retreated to narcissism, burning any bridge to redemption. While his mind went to his own greatness, mine turned to his victims. I began tweeting about Lambda School in 2019, and the more I tweeted, the more students shared messages like this: Hi Ben I just wanted to say thank you for your effort in exposing Lambda School. I was a student there and had a terrible experience. I dropped out last year (still on the hook for the 30k ISA) and since have been avoiding reading anything related to the school for my mental health. It sucks so bad that they are getting away with all of this, especially when the students are mostly minority or people who are in vulnerable positions Lambda School targeted single mothers, the disabled, reformed convicts, and people struggling with serious medical problems. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, some lost years of their lives, on a broken, predatory program. When students surfaced problems to staff, staff blamed the victims, gaslighting them with, \"Trust the process,\" or blaming everything on \"imposter syndrome.\" As the company unraveled, upset students overran the official /r/LambdaSchool subreddit with criticism. As Austen deleted posts, students created a rogue Discord to discuss legal options. Austen tried to contain things by pretending to be a student under a sock puppet account. His effort's to save his subreddit proved hopeless, and so he set it to private. This is generally how the company handled victims. Upon enrollment, students sign away many rights to legal action, not that it matters much, as most students lack the resources to hire lawyers. The rare time a victim scrounges together the resources to take legal action, the company rolled over, knowing they didn't stand a chance in court. However, they only released students from their contracts if they agreed to sign a non-disclosure agreement, robbing students the freedom to warn others. I thought Emily Bruner would find justice. A single mother who signed up for Lambda School based on false job placement rates, Emily thought it would change her life, only to be saddled with a $30,000 debt. Emily was in luck, because Lambda School forgot to make her sign away her rights to sue. Her case was taken up by a non-profit legal organization that stands up for student taken in by predatory, for-profit schools. After a long legal battle, Lambda School finally settled out of court, but Emily wasn't there to celebrate. She passed away suddenly the year before, at the age of 30, leaving behind her daughter. A famous physicist said, \"There are some things so serious that you have to laugh at them,\" and if there's anything that makes this story palatable, it's Austen's brazen stupidity. Consider how easy it was to connect him to his sock puppet account: he linked to his own tweets, and even posted a video of his golf swing. This is a story about Austen, his victims, and a once-shining startup that Silicon Valley wishes everyone would forget. How did it rise so fast and unravel even faster? We need to back up and replay Lambda School's collapse, in slow motion. It starts with the mystery of why venture capitalists handed over so much money. The Early Years Selling a Dream To Students and Investors The rise of the 2010's tech bubble saw an explosion of tech jobs paying six figures. Just as most of the money in a gold rush goes to shovel salesmen, people who can't land high-paying jobs in tech sell training. You could find code bootcamps everywhere, from legit looking classrooms to some sketchy dude's house. California has a bad history with this sort of education grift. Back in the 1980s, the state was the \"Diploma Mill Capital of the World,\" and in response, they established a bureau to regulate for-profit schools called the BPPE. This bureau had nothing to do with accreditation. They didn't care if you ran a flat-earth school, they just want to make sure that you didn't go out there claiming 90% of graduates get jobs as sea captains. The BPPE went to work reigning in the flood of sketchy bootcamps, and by 2017, the combination of BPPE penalties, negative press, and general word of mouth gave \"code bootcamp\" carried the same sullied reputation as DeVry or The Art Institute. As just another bootcamp late to the fad, Lambda School didn't stand a chance, but this was back in 2017, but common sense didn't apply to VC backed startups during that wild time when WeWork was worth twenty billion dollars. Lambda School just needed their pitch. One of the first questions a venture capitalist asks is, \"Why now?\" Just as Uber arrived at a time when taxis were annoying and everyone a computer in their pocket, what made education ripe for disruption? Skyrocketing college tuition. Via educationdata.org The problems in higher education are complicated, from the rise of predatory for-profit schools along to the defunding of public colleges. It's out of the scope of this conversation. Within the context of 2017, Lambda School's hook, \"We don't get paid until you do,\" resonated with a generation saddled with insurmountable student debt. People were desperate for a solution, and venture capitalists were thirsty to get in on it. Another problem familiar to tech VCs was the difficulty hiring coders. Tech companies were no longer gatekeeping the jobs to college degrees, with some big tech companies starting apprentice programs that welcome boot camp graduates. Lambda School's 2017 Demo Day Pitch When VCs looked at Lambda School, they saw a company with the potential to decimate Computer Science degrees the same way Uber destroyed taxi medallions. At the same time, Income Share Agreements had a huge red flag in the form of decades of failed experiments. Milton Friedman proposed ISAs as far back as 1955, and many schools experimented with them over the years, from Yale in the 1970s to Purdue in 2016, shortly before Lambda School. Every school that tried them abandoned them, for reasons we'll learn in a bit. Another red flag should have been the team. Austen cofounded the company alongside Ben Nelson and Caleb Hicks, two unremarkable former bootcamp instructors barely worth mentioning. Austen was the star of the show, but what did he bring to the table? At the time, Austen's 53,000 followers on Twitter created an illusion of importance. At least, until you come across his bragging about a bot army and follow spam on Hacker News. Austen had just packaged this sketchy advice into an eBook called, Secret Sauce: The Ultimate Growth Hacking Guide, which promised to show you how to \"Exploit loopholes in social networks for major growth.\" It's a window into how Austen thinks about marketing. Austen wrote that book as a side-hustle, while his day-job was in marketing at LendUp, a payday loan company eventually shut down by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for deceptive marketing. I'm not surprised VCs gave Austen a pass on his work history, given LendUp was another Y Combinator company. I'm surprised they thought he could build a business. Bootcamps and mildly successful eBooks are small-potato endeavors that VCs label \"lifestyle business\". It takes very different skills to build a billion dollar company, and Austen was a mere carnival barker. I think VC were blinded by ideology. Silicon Valley leans libertarian, with part-time Y Combinator partner Peter Thiel bemoaning college and offering $100,000 to entrepreneurs willing to skip it to build a startup. Thiel's donation of $1.25M to Trump's 2016 campaign, along with a rousing endorsement at the Republican National Convention, finally created enough backlash to cause the firm to sever ties. Y Combinator's founder, Paul Graham, sits so adjacent to Thiel that Graham even asks him to review his blog posts. Graham is type of guy who thinks his early investment in DoorDash was a good thing for the world. Austen pitched investors that the real problem in higher education is how schools make money regardless of whether or not you get a job. If schools only got paid when a student makes money, there's \"Incentive Alignment.\" VCs like Graham fell for it because if all you know is capitalism, everything looks like a free-market problem. In many ways, Lambda School mirrored the model of venture capital. Firms bet on a large batches of companies, and the money from the big successes make up for the flops. Funds even have incentive alignment in the form of bonuses the fund managers make when investments pass profit milestones. Graham took Austen under his wing, and when the company unraveled years later, Graham leaped to Austen's defense. To this day, Graham has never admitted any wrongdoing by Lambda School. The Product With millions of dollars in the bank and the backing of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, the cards were stacked in Lambda School's favor. All they had to do was deliver a solid education. They didn't. Actually, it kind of sucked. At its best— burning money at an unfathomable rate— Lambda School was on-par with an average code bootcamp. Students got a taste of programming, but when it came to getting hired, neither the training nor credentials held a candle to a college degree. Yet Lambda School regularly compared itself to college in its marketing, promising, \"The depth of a 4-year degree, the practicality of a bootcamp.\" An excerpt from Lambda School's front page How could a six month class compare to four years at college? Austen claimed the program striped out the non-programming portions of a computer science degree, but even after they expanded the program from six to nine months, the number of hours don't work out. Let's skip the math, physics, and other code-free classes give you a foundational understanding of computers. Let's pretend that all you need from a Computer Science degree are the programming courses. In a reputable CS program, that's around two years of class time. How do you possibly fit that into nine months? This ridiculous premise drove me to obtain a copy of the entire student curriculum, to figure out what the hell was going on. I dug into the area of my expertise, iPhone development. As expected, the curriculum was on par with an average coding boot camp. At best, it spends a few weeks skimming a handful of foundational CS concepts. Most time goes to drilling today's trendy technologies. You're welcome to argue that trendy technologies are the fastest path to an entry-level job, but it's downright fraud to say this matches the depth of a Computer Science degree. A class is about much more than the material, so let's consider the teachers. Their marketing claimed instructors, \"hail from the top companies and universities in the world.\" In reality, one iOS instructor had just graduated from a competing boot camp before getting hired, having never spent a day in the industry. The head of the data science program was Austen's brother, Ryan, whose only experience was another bootcamp and internship. With cohorts containing upwards of 200 students, you were lucky to get access to teachers at all. To deal with the ridiculous teacher-to-student ratio, the company had a \"Team Lead\" system, similar to college TAs. They hired the better students in later units to mentor the students in earlier units. Because the school encouraged students to publish their homework assignments online for self-promotion, I could dig into how many students struggle. Out of ten homework assignments I reviewed, I found that half contained memory management bugs that would have instantly failed them from the early stages of a job interview. I reached out to the students in private to check that I wasn't missing something, and heard back from one. I asked if an instructor had issued him feedback in private. No, I was the first person to point out his bugs. I later found out that Lambda School had hired this struggling student to TA other students. This lead to me to contact a hiring manager at a company that had interviewed an entire cohort of Lambda School graduates, only to reject all of them. He explained: The issue was that most of the candidates didn't make it past the first two parts of our interview funnel. The first part is a take home challenge, no time limit but really should take like an hour or two to do and many entries just weren't completed or finished. And the second part of our interview is just debugging and a continuation of the take home with white boarding. It seemed like most students weren't fully prepared. Many problems stemmed from Lambda School wanting to act more like a startup than a school, constantly experimenting with classes as if it were an early-stage product. That proved chaotic for attendees, as classes could radically change overnight. According to one student: Things seemed fine in the beginning. The instructors were good, and I liked that there were actual live classes. Things degraded very quickly. They kept changing the format and the curriculum (\"iterating\"). They doubled the length of the program that I was in, which made it impossible for me to even finish it. I was working in a tech support job where we had to do shift bids and no shift was guaranteed. I enrolled in a plan that fit the shift I was working, and the expected end date, and when they changed the program length and format, I couldn't complete it. They promised career guidance, including having a career councilor, but I never got one. They kept telling my cohort we would get our councilors after this or that milestone, but when we got there they would move the goalpost again. The closest we got was a resume course that was not relevant to tech at all and a resume review by another student. In late 2019, stories circulated about the chaotic, haphazard training, with students likening the school to a cult. When students mobbed critics on Reddit, staff thanked them on Slack. When students brought up concerns about the training, staff took them aside and explained that they're just suffering from imposter syndrome. They were told that most of programming is just Googling for answers. I'll admit that's sometimes true, but the difference between a $50 Udemy course and a $30,000 boot camp should be human beings that help you through the material. Students felt the same way, but were afraid to push back out of fear of retaliation. The school's tactic of gaslighting students couldn't go on forever. In late 2019, the new UX program had become a disaster, a far cry from the program Austen claimed had a \"100% hired.\" As students in the class began talking with one another, they realized everyone realized they had the same issues, and they demanded to be released from their ISAs due to the school's negligence. The company refused, so the students shared their stories with The Verge. Yet, many of the classes in the UX program seemed haphazard and poorly thought out to Nishida and some of his classmates. Once, during a drawing lesson that was ostensibly related to product design, students watched as the teacher sketched on a white sheet of paper. He said he was drawing a town, but the glare on the paper was so bright they couldn’t see what he was doing. When they spoke up, he grabbed a bedsheet and conducted the rest of the lesson under a makeshift curtain. To some, it felt like he hadn’t thought through the lesson — either the content he was presenting or how he was going to present it. “It highlights the unprofessionalism, incompetence, and disorganization of Lambda School’s UX program,” one student wrote in a note to Lambda. With a program that bad, how did 100% of graduates in the first UX session get hired? Austen left out that only one student graduated. Yes, 1 out of 1 is 100%, and it illustrates how the company lied without technically lying. Lambda School's marketing material cherry-picked a handful of success stories, leaving out the vast majority of failures. Of those successes, they left out important details. For example, a woman on the front page of their website has the caption, \"went from stay at home mom to a Software Development Engineer at Amazon.\" They left out that the woman was a professional programmer for seven years prior to motherhood. Lambda School was doomed because it couldn't decide who it was for. It marketed itself as a college replacement, but treated the material with the depth of a vocational school. They claimed there were plenty of humble programming jobs outside of Silicon Valley, yet classes wasted time on skills unmarketable outside buzzy tech startups, such as the blockchain. The company's few remaining apologists blame its failure on everything from government regulation to companies biased toward college degrees, but make no mistake, the company failed because the program failed. This was supposed to be the point in the story when Income Share Agreements fix everything. Instead, we get to watch what happens when a good idea clashes with reality. Why Income Share Agreements Failed As mentioned earlier, colleges tried ISAs for years before Lambda School. Why were they abandoned? It seems impossible to construct ISAs in a way that benefits the student without exposing the school to more risk. It's expected that programs that offer ISAs will have worse hiring results than those that ask for payment up-front. Apologists blame it on students who attend for free, decide they don't like coding, and drop out because there's no \"skin in the game.\" Maybe that's a thing, but I think it's much more likely that the students who need an ISA, the students barely getting by, face more struggles than the people who can afford to pay up front. If a school wants to reduce the risk, they could be more rigorous in admissions, only accepting the students they're sure will pay them back. That means either denying admission to anyone who genuinely needs the ISA, or charging different people different prices based on their risk. If you squint, this looks like an argument for payday loans. If nobody else will service these groups, is it better to offer something at a higher price than to offer nothing at all? Push past these ethical quandaries and we get to the technical problems. How do you prove that the school did its job? If a student majors in math and finds a job in programming, does that count? What happens if the student gets hired, but gets laid off a month later? As you go down this path, you speed-run the student loan system, reinventing concepts like hardship-deferments and income-driven repayment forgiveness. We should absolutely overhaul American education, but if we want to make lives better for millions of indebted students as quickly as possible, the fastest pain relief would come from better educating people on existing escape hatches. Going back to ISAs, let's focus on the thorniest clause of the contract: \"You pay nothing if you don't find a job in a related field within X years.\" What is a fair value for X? If you pick 'one year,' students may take on an unrelated job just to run down their clock. The longer you pick for the length, the more it benefits scammers. For a clever scammer, ISAs offer a smoke screen. As early warning signs about Lambda School popped up, critics were met with, \"How can it be a scam? You only pay when you get a job!\" If the company stayed afloat, it must mean the program works? It takes several years for an ISAs to pay back the company, yet a company needs that money right away, because teachers don't take rain checks. Lambda School's solution was to sell half their ISAs to hedge funds at a discount, in exchange for cash up front. Nobody told the students about these deals. Their marketing claimed, \"We don't get paid until you do.\" Students thought that if the school was solvent, the program had to work, right? In reality, the company was burning through venture capital at a staggering rate, and propped up by hedge funds. When these hedge fund deals were exposed, Austen claimed that he never lied about it. He argued it didn't make a difference, anyway, because Lambda School was still incentive-aligned. He argued that if the program didn't work out, hedge funds would stop buying the ISAs. That's exactly what happened. In February of 2020, Lambda School's ISAs disappeared from Edly, an ISA marketplace. The hedge funds were done being bag holders. When a startup with an inexperienced founder struggles, investors bring in an 'adult' to fix things. Following their first round of layoffs, Molly Graham was hired as Chief Operating Officer in May of 2020. Graham had worked at Facebook from 2008 to 2013, making her Lambda School's first executive with any experience at a successful startup. Two months later, she explained the startup's dire situation at a company all-hands meeting: on average, the company spent $13,000 on every graduate, only to see $5,750 back. Via Business Insider This is supposed to be the moment when Income Share Agreements save the day. The school just needs to slow down, buckle up, and… uh… what exactly? For an ISA to work, a school needs the self-awareness to accept their problem. Instead, Austen blamed employers for refusing to give his students a chance. Instead of fixing the training, he tried to disrupt his way out of the problem, leading to the launch of the company's dumbest product: unpaid internships. Companies could \"try\" an engineer at their company for four weeks at no cost. It was right there in the FAQ: In the words of Paul Graham: Every developer on Twitter revolted, burning any goodwill that remained for the company. Following the backlash, Austen apologized, but deleted the apology a few minutes later. This snapshot was recovered from a quote tweet, hence truncation. He then pretended that they always planned to pay the interns, and that this was all a giant misunderstanding. Tweets a few hours after the Lambda Fellows launch Lambda School eventually paid interns $15 an hour, only adding to its financial problems. Behind closed doors, the quest for profitability would further unravel the program. It may be difficult for honest schools to offer ISAs, but at least they protect students from scammers, right? Imagine I offer a class that teaches the secret to winning the lottery. The class is free, but you agree to pay me 17% of your earnings if you win. If I teach enough people, someone will eventually win the lottery through none of my help. You can structure a scam around an ISA by inserting fine print that holds people to their debt many years later, whether or not they find a job related to what they studied. Then you cast as wide a net as possible, signing up as many people as possible. Run classes at low overhead, and then just scale your way to riches. From the beginning, Lambda School was designed to run cheap. With classes run entirely online, students attend from across the country, with hundreds crammed into a single Zoom session. From the beginning, Lambda School's ISAs had bizarre fine print, like the five-year term that applies from whenever you graduate or (just as likely) drop out. After the program, you could find zero work, go back to school for an associate's degree, and still owe the school money. Income Share Agreements only protect students if they're willing to give up their dream of becoming a developer. Then there was the refund policy. While the program lasted 40 weeks, students were on the hook for 40% of their ISA after week four, and 100% of their ISA debt after week ten. According to students, the staff front-loaded all the good material to lure students past the trial period. Lambda School was always rigged, but subsidized by millions in venture capital. By early 2020, it was clear the program didn't work, and they could see bankruptcy over the horizon. The best thing that happened to Lambda School was COVID. As the world shut down with the pandemic, technology was the one industry that thrived, and big tech companies were desperate for employees. Lambda School intersected the two areas with the most potential: online-only classes, and training for tech jobs. Despite all the controversies, they announced another round of funding in August, 2020. They had one chance to change the trajectory of the company. Following Molly Graham's all-hands meeting that revealed their dire financial situation, she laid out the plan to set things right. In Fall of 2020, Lambda School decimated its program to save money. Not only did they cut the program from nine months to six months, they also removed all paid TA positions, replacing them with \"Peer mentoring.\" Students in later units were expected to mentor students in earlier units. The explanation they fed to students. This was catastrophic, because Lambda School's huge class sizes left little time for instructors to spend one-on-one time with students. TAs were essential for students to keep up, and they were now replaced by students upset by unpaid work. This led to people coasting through the program without anyone so much as glancing at their homework. This all happened mid-program, screwing over students already on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars of debt. Soon, students formed their own Discord to consider legal options, and the official Lambda School subreddit was flooded with angry students revolting against the changes. Slashing the program couldn't stop the bleeding, and April 2021 saw a major layoff that cut 65 of their 200 employees. While this bought the company more time, it needed to completely rethink its business, but most of Lambda School's executives weren't up for that ride. Austen's cofounders, Ben Nelson and Caleb Hicks, quietly resigned in April and June of 2021, and Molly Graham resigned that October. In November 2021, Lambda School rebooted. Income Share agreements were still available, but with ridiculous terms. Instead of $0 up front, students now paid up to $7,950. The maximum repayment cap was raised to $42,950. Most importantly, they removed the promise that you only paid back your ISA for a tech job; now you were on the hook for any job over $50,000 a year. The new Lambda School put heavy emphasis on traditional loans that charge up to 18.95% interest on $19,000 in tuition. They included a \"Tuition Refund Guarantee.\" They claimed that if you don't get a job within one year, you get a 110% refund, but the fine print is ridiculous. Students must apply to ten jobs per week, reach out to ten strangers per week, and post ten code changes online per week, for 40 weeks in the next year. It's the student's responsibility to track all of this. Alongside the pivot away from ISAs, the company changed its name to \"The Bloom Institute of Technology.\" Everyone on the Internet rightfully assumed it was to escape the negative publicity, like when Philip Morris renamed itself Altria. If you Googled \"Lambda School\" at the time, the first page turned up their crimes and painted the picture of a school on the cusp of collapse. Austen claims the rebranding was all about a trademark dispute… and technically that is true. Back in 2019, the AI hardware company Lambda Labs sued Lambda School for the Lambda in its name. But what were the grounds for its case? According to the lawsuit, Lambda School's deceptions damaged its brand. Case 4:19-cv-04060-JST Document 74 Filed 06/16/20 Page 3 of 7 As the case dragged on, Lambda School went so far as to acquire the \"Red Lambda\" trademark from a company in Florida to defend its ownership. After fighting this case for years, why did they suddenly give up? It's true, lawsuits are expensive and the company was burning through too much money, but that doesn't explain the scale of their rebranding. Normally when companies settle these disputes, the loser negotiates to change things as little as possible to make the winner happy. For example, when the World Wildlife Fund went after the World Wrestling Federation for \"WWF,\" and the latter agreed to change their name to \"World Wrestling Entertainment\" and made minor tweaks to its logo. If you wanted to save Lambda School's brand, you might do something as simple as turning the Lambda into a Delta. Delta signifies change, and the school is supposed to change students, so I'd argue Delta is actually better than Lambda from a messaging perspective. The old Lambda School logo vs one I'd propose. That's just one possibility. Obviously there's more that goes into this, like searching the trademark registry, but the goal is to stay as close to the original as possible. They didn't do that because their brand was now worthless, and the trademark lawsuit was a perfect excuse to throw it all out. However, try as they may to run away from their past, there's no outrunning justice. The Fall of Austen Allred The journalist who exposed Lambda School wasn't a journalist by trade. Vincent Woo was a successful entrepreneur best known for CoderPad, a collaborative coding website used extensively in programming job interviews. After he sold CoderPad for millions of dollars, he focused on the public interest, such as housing activism. Woo's work on CoderPad gave him expert insight into the programming job market, and in 2019, Austen's outrageous hiring numbers set off red flags. Whenever pressed for more details on his outrageous claims, Austen said a full report was coming soon, but six months would pass without any updates. Woo's obtained an investment memo Lambda School sent out to Y Combinator titled, \"Human Capital: The Last Unoptimized Asset Class.\" In it, they disclose, “We’re at roughly 50% placement for cohorts that are 6 months graduated,” contradicting the very front page of their website. Where did the 86% on their homepage come from? In 2018, Lambda School submitted a single report about 72 graduates to CIRR. CIRR is an organization formed by the boot camp industry following the boot camp crackdown of the 2010s, to cleanup their image. Bootcamps are supposed to submit their hiring stats every six months, in one standard format, to prevent underhanded boot camps from fudging the numbers. In two years, Lambda School had produced nothing beyond that single, small report. Woo reached out to Sabrina Baez, Lambda School's former Director of Career Readiness. Baez oversaw job placement in those early days, and Austen had reprimanded her for low hiring rates. She told Woo that probably only 50% to 60% of graduates found jobs. Finally, Woo obtained private communications with investors revealing the quiet deals with hedge funds. This flew in the face of their marketing's, \"We don’t get paid until you do,\" and Austen's now-deleted tweet, “We never, ever get paid upfront for ISAs.” With all the damning evidence, the story was ready. Most reporters would now email their subjects for comment, but Woo elevated the story to performance art. He asked Austen for a recorded interview, without revealing its nature. Austen, lulled into a false sense of security by tech press puff pieces, agreed. What followed was the most riveting hour of tech journalism I've ever heard. Austen: \"Our goal right now, is that if a student is endorsed, call it graduation, that we place 80% within 120 days.\" Woo: \"Why did you tell investors 50?\" Austen: \"What… I don't know… what communication you're referring to.\" The interview went downhill from there, as Austen scrambled to invent excuses. NYMag published Woo's story on February 19, 2020, and that very same day Lambda School pushed out a blog post announcing they resold ISAs. One month later, Austen published a report purporting 71% job placement rates— but he arrived there by removing the \"$50,000 or more\" bit. He claimed that the 50% he had told investors was actually total enrolled students, not graduates. Yet if you dissect Austen's own data, you quickly arrive at 55%. Moving forward, Lambda School's job reports only counted graduates who were \"job seeking.\" This is a common trick where bootcamps make up reasons that they don't have to count the graduates who couldn't find jobs. If a graduate, say, stops working with a useless career coach who mostly blames them for not trying hard enough, then the bootcamp classifies that graduate as no longer job seeking. In Lambda School's last outcomes report, they gloss over the 34% of graduates who were not job-seeking, as if it's perfectly normal for someone to go through an intense nine-month program and just change their mind. On October 25, 2021, Vincent Woo delivered a follow-up story, published by Business Insider. Not only did it leak the company's infamous 2020 all-hands meeting that exposed the company's downward spiral, it also revealed that only 27% of graduates found jobs. It wasn't because of COVID. Tech only saw a minor dip at the start of the pandemic. In fact, tech companies were so thirsty for talent that it was easier than ever to get a job as a developer without a college degree. The reason Lambda School's hiring rates dropped should be obvious to anyone who spends time around bootcamps, or education in general. Lambda School tried to scale up. Small schools and small class sizes have better results, largely because it's hard to find good instructors, and people need a lot of 1:1 attention. Bootcamps don't scale up to become business dollar businesses. Staff warned about a downward trajectory back in 2018, in an internal memo that said, “Placement to date has been manual and one-off, which isn’t possible to scale.” That was back when they were training a few hundred students a year, and at their peak, they trained 2,700 students. In response to Woo's latest story, Austen claimed that the numbers were wrong, but couldn't explain why he'd present wrong numbers to his entire company. Despite his denials, the layoffs and executive exodus made it clear to outsiders that Lambda School had crashed and burned. Two days later, Austen tweeted: I wish people could see how ugly it is to be envious, and how obvious it is to those around you when that's what's happening. There's not much uglier than trying to tear someone down because they achieved what you wish you had. Is he talking about Vincent Woo? Woo's CoderPad made a lasting impact on tech hiring, and he successfully sold that company for more money than Austen could ever make from Lambda School. What could Woo possibly be jealous of? Some blame for this distortion falls on Paul Graham. Back in December 2019, at the top of Austen's downward spiral, Graham gave him a pep-talk. The Lambda School student Slack, December 2019. Graham later turned it into an essay about \"Haters.\" He wrote: What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because anyone famous knows how random fame is. Graham even thanked Austen for reviewing it, along with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. Thanks to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Christine Ford, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Elon Musk, Harj Taggar, and Peter Thiel for reading drafts of this. Graham published that essay on January 11, 2020, and Woo recorded his fateful interview with Austen eleven days later. That humiliation still haunted Austen two years later, as he struggled to paint a picture of a thriving company. Following Woo's reporting, Lambda School was pressured to publish regular, audited job reports. Those reports included the total number of students who attend every year, and if you graph it and you see a company in freefall. Data obtained via Outcome Reports Contrast that with the explosion in tech job openings following the pandemic. Data Via Statistica Asked why so many people want to see him fail, Austen posted a thread full of theories. It's true, tons of people want to see him fail, but it has nothing to do with the university system or his love of capitalism. It's because every time he's caught in a lie, he recites the Narcissist's Prayer: That didn't happen. And if it did, it wasn't that bad. And if it was, that's not a big deal. And if it is, that's not my fault. And if it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, you deserved it. Consider the time Austen tweeted that 100% of the students in his UX class had been hired, when only one student graduated. I confronted him about it on Hacker News, pointing to screenshots in The Verge article. He replied: I did say the hiring rate of a cohort of one student was 100%. And in the same tweet I said, in all caps BUT VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. Odd how that doesn’t make the article, don’t you think? For the record, the article included \"VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE,\" twice, and I think that makes him look worse. Either he genuinely thinks a vague disclaimer is a get-out-of-jail-free card, or he's using the classic narcissist bluff of projecting so much confidence that the accuser wonders if they're the idiot for bringing this up. In another incident on Hacker News, I mentioned Lambda School's unpaid intern program, Lambda Fellows. Austen replied: Again, not true. We launched a program called \"fellows\" where companies didn't pay, but we paid the students, and if the company afterwards hired the student they would pay us back. It was successful and operates to this day. This is a lie. When Fellows launched, the program was unpaid. Following the backlash, he agreed to pay students. When I pointed to his own company's FAQ saying the program was unpaid, he replied: This is fair - there were students who just wanted experience even if unpaid, and the initial intent was to build it into the school itself literally with no pay. I changed my mind on that one after conversations with a few students, and we changed the design as you pointed out, but no student ever did any unpaid work, so it's also not accurate to say that we had a bunch of students doing unpaid work. He flipped from \"that didn't happen,\" to \"And if it did, it wasn't that bad,\" without missing a beat. The \"no student ever did any unpaid work\" bit is a lie, because they piloted the program for months before its debut, without paying students. Austen bragging about the Fellows program, before its public launch and backlash. Austen still claims he spent time homeless, but he wasn't actually homeless. At least not in the way most people think. When you hear \"homeless,\" you probably imagine someone thrust into the spot due to mental illness, addiction, or domestic violence. Austen chose to camp out of his car to avoid paying rent while he pitched his first startup around Silicon Valley. Back in Utah, his annoyed fiancé and multi-millionaire parents waited with open arms. To Austen, homelessness was a fun personal challenge, like running a marathon or cutting out red meat. He wrote on Quora: Austen distorted his past to recruit students who were genuinely homeless. Jesse Horne first experienced homelessness at 17 years old, due to family issues and mental health problems. Austen replied on Hacker News, \"Hi Jesse, I'm also formerly homeless…\" before pitching him on Lambda School's latest innovation: a GoFundMe to send the homeless to Lambda School. If Austen truly believes he was homeless, that might even be worse than just lying for publicity. If he lacks empathy for those genuinely struggling, it explains why he jumped to victim blaming when students brought up problems. To him, the system is never broken, you just aren't working hard enough. His \"tuition refund guarantee\" isn't misleading, because if you aren't ready to submit 400 job applications just don't have what it takes to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I think Austen could have found success starting an MLM back in Utah, a state run rampant with get-rich-quick schemes. His mistake was going after education in California, a state ready to deal with for-profit schools. He wasn't ready for the law. In 2019, California's BPPE fined Lambda School $75,000 and ordered them to cease operations. Like any for-profit school, Lambda needed to register with the state and wait for approval. They had never even registered and just operated illegally for the last two years. Austen claimed the school had made an honest mistake, and the company lawyer, who he claimed told them that since all the classes were online, it didn't need approval. Sure. Austen claimed the paperwork was filed, and told students, “The process takes time, but we’re working with [BPPE] to comply. There is no impact to students right now.” Eight months later, on a hunch, I emailed the BPPE. They told me that Lambda School was not approved, had been ordered to shut down, and they were operating illegally. Austen sidestepped this issue with students because he didn't want students to know about an important California law: when a school operates illegally, the students don't owe it any money. All of those income share agreements were invalid. Despite this, Lambda School still went after graduates who shouldn't have had to pay. The company struggled with California approval because ISAs existed in a legal gray area. In fact Lambda School spent $210,000 on Washington lobbyists in 2019 to try to straighten them out, to no avail. In 2020, Lambda School gave up offering ISAs in California, they were quickly approved. But even bigger legal trouble was brewing. Believe it or not, until January 1, 2021, there were no laws in California to protect consumers from a lie in Lambda School's contracts; the company claimed students they were taking on student loans that couldn't be discharged in bankruptcy, which was completely false. In January of 2021, AB 1864 went into effect, and California's financial protection bureau laid down the law. Lambda School tried to underplay the settlement. They claimed that regulators had approved of the school, and merely asked them to remove a bit from the contract that was \"not required.\" When California got wind of the spin, they issued a follow-up announcement calling out their bullshit. The DFPI has received information that Lambda used potentially misleading marketing after executing its settlement with DFPI to resolve deceptive practices. Lambda School recently published a public blog post that the DFPI believes could be misinterpreted by potential students or the public more generally. … Meanwhile, the uprising that destroyed Lambda School's subreddit boiled over into the real world, as students spread the word of The National Student Legal Defense, a legal non-profit that helps students trapped by predatory schools. Because students signed away their rights to a class action lawsuit as part of their enrollment agreement, the non-profit had to tackle arbitration on a case-by-case basis. The first three lawsuits landed in May 2021. Lambda School quietly settled all eight cases so far, but this is a slow process. Student Defense thought they found a weakness in the anti-class-action provisions, after changes Lambda School made to their contracts in 2020. They filed a class action lawsuit in 2023, this time naming Austen Allred himself a defendant, in addition to the company. Sadly, in January 2024, a judge ruled that the case had to go through arbitration. Austen, as usual, misrepresented what happened, claiming it as a win. It felt like Austen would get away with everything. I couldn't believe that was the end of this story. What lesson have I learned watching this story unfold over the past five years? That you can get away with anything if you pick the right victims? Two months later, the law finally caught up. In April 2024, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a settlement with both the company, and Austen individually. Both had tricked students with inflated job-placement rates, lied about selling loans to investors, and violated the Holder Rule. The CFPB decided that ISAs are just loans with hidden fees. They banned Austen and Lambda School from engaging in student lending. Every student who has not found a job in the last year was released from their ISA. They fined the school itself a mere $64,000, and personally fined Austen $100,000. Beyond the penalties, the ruling validated everyone that Austen gaslit over the years. The consent order spelled out every one of his lies. But with all the money revolving around the company, isn't $100,000 just a slap on the wrist? While Austen likes to play the role of a successful entrepreneur, he claims he isn't rich. Obviously he didn't have money going in, as his previous startups went nowhere, but what is this \"secondary offering\" thing? Normally, a founder only gets rich when their company has an IPO or gets bought. When a startup grows as fast as Lambda School, sometimes investors allow the founders to sell a portion (say, 20%?) of their stock to outsiders, early. This is known as a secondary offering. Why? If the founder is allowed to take enough money off the table that to become slightly rich, they feel less pressure to sell the company before it reaches its full potential. However, if the founder truly believes in the future of their company, they'll use that cash to pay off taxes on the rest of their stock. Without getting too far in the weeds, that's like winning a hand at poker and going all-in on the next round. If that's really what happened, then Austen threw away millions of dollars. Lambda School is now seven years old, an age when successful startups look to IPO. Surely his investors have given up and marked it as a loss on their balance sheets. At this point, any reasonable founder would wind down the company, brush themselves off, and start on their next venture. Now up to its third layoff in three years, it seems Austen will do whatever it takes to keep the lights on. He would rather captain a ghost ship than admit defeat and move on. Why? According to his book, Austen follows one thousand strangers on Twitter every day. Over a decade, this has amassed him 330,000 followers. But what has that ultimately achieved? Follower counts are deceiving. Because of Twitter's longstanding \"churn\" problem, most followers of old accounts are inactive. When you gain followers by just following strangers, those followers are very low-value. They either followed back out of courtesy, or because they're bots planning to message you spam. For example, Austen launched a YouTube channel last year. He repeatedly plugged it on Twitter, and even offered money to followers. One year later, the channel sits at 866 subscribers. The videos themselves have a mere few hundreds views. Yes, Austen has a big follower count on Twitter, but that doesn't amount to much. This speaks to the self-destructive cocktail that causes all his problems: an unhealthy relationship with social media, a pervasive grind mindset, and the need to distort reality. Other unscrupulous bootcamps never face the scrutiny or Lambda School, and I'm certain other startup CEOs that commit crimes but never face personal charges. Austen wouldn't have faced consequences if he hadn't tweeted the smoking guns that took him down. He seems to care more about attention than success, like he'd rather be hated than forgotten. Just as Lambda School sold the dream that anyone can get a job as a developer with a few months of grind, Austen was sold the dream if he just works enough hours, someday he'll become Elon Musk. But the world doesn't work like a Silicon Valley startup, and while the wheels of justice turn slowly, they grind exceedingly fine. Just as his victims couldn't afford a day in court, Austen finds himself in a similar situation, oblivious to the irony. Austen has moved back to a small town in Utah. He's begun promoting his new side-hustle, a small venture capital fund, but he assures everyone that Lambda School is alive and well. They've pivoted into AI classes. A few days before the consumer financial protection bureau fined him $100,000, he tweeted: Maybe this is like his \"100% hired\" distortion. After all, five times zero is still zero. Or maybe he really believes it. Maybe the last person he's fooled is himself. Previous issue Clever Hans and the Uncanny Valley",

I'm reminded of the ending of Ratatouille when the critic figures out that the motto \"Anyone can cook\" means \"Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere\". I'm personally biased, but I feel like one bootcamp program that got this right (for a while) was Insight Data Science. For a few years at the start of the 'data boom' there was a market inefficiency where tech needed more people that understood stats and ML and there were a ton of STEM postdocs that wanted to leave academia. The program worked because it wasn't really about teaching any new skills, it was mostly about being able to market the skills you have in a different sector. But after a few years, the market corrected itself and there was no shortage of data/stats people in tech anymore and there were enough resources for those academics to manage the transition on their own. I don't know if the program still exists, but if they do I'm not sure what they could do now to make themselves relevant. reply OhMeadhbh 1 hour agoprevBack in the late 80s / early 90s, I taught non-traditional students coming in through state-funded retraining programs at UT Arlington Continuing Education and Texas State Technical Institute (now TSTC) in Waco. The idea was \"here are a bunch of laid-off manufacturing workers who want to retrain as SOMETHING with high-tech.\" The most popular courses were of the very short \"here's how to do some things with Unix\" variety: how to log-in, how to do simple admin, how to exit vi, how to edit a file with emacs, Make for the perplexed, etc. I did teach a 6 week C++ course. Mostly attended by CS students at the local college. Back in the day we didn't teach kids how to code in a CS cirriculum. They were expected to just pick it up themselves. Six weeks really isn't enough to teach how to be good at C++. I spent a fair amount of time reading Papert and Piaget, trying to develop a theory on how people learn and how to best teach \"programming\" concepts. I've yet to see ANYONE (myself included) do an excellent job teaching the kind of programming employers want. I saw another comment here about how \"programming\" is simple, but teaching architecture and putting things together is hard. I would mostly agree with that. But... there are some techniques that are better than others. My experience w/ Lambda School was they tried to hire me as an instructor way back when. I talked to them briefly about pedagogy and their approach to modeling learning and how they were going to measure improvements in their cirriculum. I got blank looks. They kept harping about how they were going to iterate, but without the slightest idea how they were going to improve between iterations. I quietly walked out the door never to return (moving to Seattle to work for Amazon instead.) It looks like I made the right call. reply busterarm 2 hours agoprevAppAcademy started with and still does ISAs and has been fairly successful. There have been situations where they've deemed certain participants greater risk and NOT offered them ISAs and asked for upfront payment, but I believe their success has largely been a result of aggressive candidate filtering all the way up to 1/3 of the way through the program after its started. I have first hand experience with their program, albeit 10 years ago, but I would largely say that almost no one who completed the program with me actually needed it and its benefits are largely a forcing function to get you to build a portfolio in a short amount of time and have a peer group to rely on.

Everyone else did find jobs within about 3 months. All but three have moved into senior roles. Of those three, one prefers just being an IC and two moved into product management. I don't know how things are lately but given sentiment I hear about hiring from bootcamps, I imagine they haven't been able to hold up the high numbers that they had in their first few years. Would love to hear otherwise though. I still think the program is expensive for what it is, but I don't regret it at all. My only regret was that I chose between changing careers and putting all my money in crypto at the time...back when Bitcoin was still in double digits. If I'd chosen differently I would be rich beyond my wildest dreams. reply tyre 1 hour agorootparentFeels like not finding a job for two years isn’t really winning, unless the terms of the ISA were insane.

They had plenty of backing from their families to do so. I agree with you but people who grift aren't usually making the most rational choices anyway. The bootcamp's selection process is basically picking winners. I was nearly unique among my cohort for my background. It was overwhelmingly ivy grads and silver spoon kids. They're selecting for people that can afford to move to one of the most expensive cities in the world without working for 6 months.

Getting both kids and adults (especially kids) to figure out how to program is easy if you understand that most of the concepts are better taught visually through p5js or what have you. Once they leave that sandbox, however, and have to contend with what has to go into developing a production React app, it's a different animal. Programming is easy. Putting a bunch of black-boxes together in order to build some app or whatever is much, much harder and more complex (and, arguably, I think that calling it programming is kind of deceptive. You're technically doing programming, but you really feel like you are? I can't say I do.) Incidentally this is perhaps why I'm calmer than others when it comes to AI getting better and better at programming. All these researchers and companies have done is given me another black box to manage. They mean to assault my castle by first repairing its walls. reply duxup 1 hour agorootparentThe frustration factor is a big deal. I took a bootcamp. One day and another student and I were working on something and a third member of our group (who had other issues) was really frustrated and took it out on us and then went to the teacher. She told the teacher \"they just get it and I don't\". But in truth the other student and I were not \"just getting it\", we were failing frequently, we had made no more progress on what was a fairly elementary task than she did. We just kept trying ... kept our hands on the keyboard and came up with new things to try. We were no less frustrated too. Now there's more to it than just typing like coming up with those ideas / thinking it through, but the grit to do that is not something many people have just to start. Amusingly that seems to be a problem with seasoned programmers too. I work with some good guys who do their job well enough, but man they hit a little cognitive dissonance and they just fall apart. I'm not better and very much not smarter, I just keep thinking about the problem and keep trying.

We're both now senior enough in our jobs that we're team/project leads (not managers, just technical leaders of stuff). One of the projects I'm leading is a small R&D effort to see if a new technique will improve one of our core algorithms. And I have a very bright new junior programmer who has been with the company about 2 years and has a little post-college experience at another company, so he's not totally new. When I give him work, he gets stuck (it's R&D after all), and blames the library or the API or things like that. It's like the \"no there's not a bug in the compiler meme\". I'll take a good chunk of my day and pair with him to show him how to get around the problems, and it seems like he gets it, and then the next week when we sync up, he's back to blaming the tools. My wife's opinion is that it just take a LONG time to learn that you're usually the one who's wrong, not the tools. And she pointed out that we both spent about 5 years in grad school. The biggest lesson of grad school is that you never know what's going on and that you need to figure out your tools, and that you're always the dumb one. I've always been a little disappointed that I wasted so many prime earning years in grad school, but I think I agree with her here. Grad school is as close to the old \"apprentice\" model where you don't earn much (if any) money because you're primary goal is to learn the field and you really spend most of your time being in the way or annoying to your grad advisor. You don't bring much value in the time you're there. Much of that is learning how to deal with failure and working around that. (Edited to add: last week I found my archive of code that I wrote in grad school. I was surprised how little code I produced in those years and how I could now have solved the problem in about a week or so since I understand what tooling I now have at my disposal. But I did learn a ton in those years.) I'm trying to figure out a way to get those lessons to my junior teammates (without making them feel as worthless as I did in grad school). To bring this back to the topic, maybe Lamba school like boot camps are a problem just because the time is so compressed. You need time to keep learning the lesson that it's not the compiler, it's you. And then you can learn the problem solving of how do _I_ make this work. Lots of self-taught from a young age people learn this, so it's not the grad school that's as important as the freedom to have time to learn (while not being on the hook to be providing value to someone who's paying you). Not saying it's fair and I understand people need to support themselves, but I do think that the best problem solvers have put in the time and there's not real substitute for time. reply zenlikethat 55 minutes agorootparentDepends, I've come across plenty of people who act like what you say there, probably because it's a variant on the natural human tendency to cast blame on something besides ourselves, but... these days, things move so fast and we lean on so many amateur part-time projects, that bugs or shortcomings in the libraries etc. we use are not uncommon. The fine art is partially in knowing when it's extremely unlikely you hit a bug (gcc), vs. very likely (JS library with five stars on Github). But more importantly, in digging in -- to me, that's a big part that's missing in leveling up the next generation -- like hey, there's a stack trace, let's go look at the lines of code in our source libraries and think about them instead of flailing around randomly like most people seem to. reply auggierose 1 hour agorootparentprevLet's face it, most of the time the tools are the problem. That is why, whenever possible, I write my own tools. reply michaelrpeskin 1 hour agorootparentYeah, for learning that's good. But for novel research, not so much. I do a lot of what I always call \"fast math on a computer\" because that was a by product of me writing my own tools to solve problems in grad school. I didn't have numpy and only very limited BLAS optimizations existed at the time, so I had to write lots of low level stuff. But the actual novel work was pretty small on top of that. In my grandparent post I mentioned that I could redo my PhD thesis in about a week of work. Much of that is that I know where the dead ends lie now. But a lot is also that I could just take advantage of numpy and I could just write everything in vector math now and not need to code up my own linear algebra stuff. reply auggierose 1 hour agorootparentWell, try running numpy on apple metal. reply darkerside 1 hour agorootparentprevHe's not going to recognize the pattern on his own, no matter how obvious it is to you. You will do him a disservice if you don't pull him aside one day and say, hey I noticed you have a blind spot, and I need to point it out to you because it's going to be a limiter for your career unless you learn to deal with it. reply michaelrpeskin 23 minutes agorootparentYeah, you're right. This is the non-technical part of being a leader that I really struggle with. I'm much more comfortable \"leading by example\" and modelling behaviors and much less comfortable with how to frame a discussion like this. Much of my company and field is full of nerds that are a bit outcast (including me). I hate the overuse of the term \"bullying\", but I'd say that most of the people I work with daily weren't the most loved kids in school. So I don't want to add \"boss thinks I'm doing a bad job\" anxiety on someone by telling them that they're not matching my expectations. And If I put myself back to being 3 years or so out of college, I was probably behaving the same way, and maybe time to figure it out is what he needs. My grad advisor was a real not nice guy, and even after all these years I still don't really like him. But he was what _I_ needed and my reaction to his pressure was to become a much better problem solver. I know I shouldn't act like him, but I haven't had many great role models in how to talk to someone about their performance. I want to him to get the message that \"he's smart and I know he'll figure it out\" and not the message that \"he's a bad employee and that he needs to start worrying about being let go in this bad job market\" reply ryandrake 1 hour agorootparentprev> Programming is easy. Putting a bunch of black-boxes together in order to build some app or whatever is much, much harder and more complex This is why I think those low-level \"invert a binary tree\" and \"find a substring in a string\" questions are not really that great if you're trying to find someone to actually build an application. Many more people know how to invert a binary tree than know how to go from an empty text file to a non-trivial mobile app distributed in an App Store. This is why I like high level design questions like: \"Design an application that takes a user's GPS location, draws it on a map, and shows the 10 nearest restaurants.\" I'm not expecting them to open up their IDE and start coding. I want to see someone who can draw boxes and lines connecting them, and write the right words in those boxes. I want them to show which of those lines are network calls, which of them are IPC, and which of them are API calls within the actual app. Which of them are provided by the operating system and which of them will they need to write themselves? Then show what one of those lines might look like as an API. I don't care if they know the exact code that should be in those boxes.

Famous people like Paul Graham touted it constantly on Twitter and even wrote an essay defending the Lambda School founder when the first criticisms started gaining momentum. > Is this maybe an easy to see problem that is part of a larger education problem none the less? Trying to reduce all education options to the same level removes the nuance that makes this story what it is. Of course you can find bad education experiences in many forms, but it’s also easy to discover that Stanford has an excellent CS program while some private no-name for-profit university has no reputation. In this case, the most reputable bootcamp that was being touted by industry titans as the superior education option turned out to be one of the worst. That’s the story. reply goat_whisperer 1 hour agoparentprevYou can argue about the value of traditional education. But I think you would be hard pressed to find a university, even a crappy one, where it's up to the students to TA themselves, there are 100 students to one professor, and the curriculum constantly changes in the middle of a semester. So it's not quite accurate to try and compare Lambda to a traditional univeristy. But congrats on your success in career changing. It begs the question of whether you could've done that on your own without attending a boot camp. reply duxup 1 hour agorootparentI don't think I could have done it without a camp. I think that initial push to get \"over the hump\", at least the first hump for me really required someone I could immediately bounce questions off of, the structure of a classroom environment, and push to keep going because, class goes on. Granted after that... I was fine learning on my own / that's half the job of programming. But initially I don't think I would have made it over that first hill. I do think that is a personal learning style thing. When I was younger I was a TERRIBLE formal schooling type learner. When I went back I was appreciative / loved that environment. reply least 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't really think the primary value of a bootcamp is teaching you anything you couldn't learn on your own, but that it pushes you into a structured environment with other like-minded people to interact with and mentorship from experienced developers. reply SpicyLemonZest 1 hour agoparentprevThe article claims that their true placement rate was below 30%.

I started Lambda School in 2019. I was in one of their first part-time evening cohorts. The original program length was 9 months. I went into the program with a lot of prior programming experience as a hobbyist and MUD programmer, but no professional experience. I had been trying to get a programming job for over a decade without success. I hoped it would help me build a portfolio and network of peers. At that time, I was working in a helpdesk role that I had had for about 5 years. It was a call center job, so I didn't have a lot of control over my schedule, but was able to arrange to keep my schedule for the nine months of the program. About 3 months into the program, they completely changed the structure of the program, which doubled the length to 18 months. I completed the core curriculum and the capstone project. Throughout the program they kept promising to connect us with career counselors, but kept pushing it back. First it would be after we were halfway through the core curriculum, then when we finished the core curriculum, then when we started the capstone project, then when we finished it. I never once got to speak with any kind of career professional. The closest we got was a peer reviewed resume. After the capstone project, we started a \"computer science\" module, which was supposed to be the end of the course. I did a few weeks of the computer science module, but couldn't continue when my shift changed, since this was outside of the original nine months. I tried to make arrangements to finish the module on my own time, but they wouldn't allow this. The only option I was given was to withdraw from the program. By the time I had finished, the reputation for Lambda was already tanking. I tried sending out resumes, but I couldn't get any traction at all. I did Triplebyte and passed, but only got one interview from that process and it didn't lead to a job. Meanwhile, I got a pay bump that put me over the 50k. Lambda came after me for the ISA, since I had a job in tech. It didn't matter that it was the same job I had had for 5 years before starting their program. I went to a lawyer and was told that the contract required arbitration in New York City, which would be too expensive to bother with, so I just paid the ISA. I later went through a different bootcamp on scholarship and did end up getting a SWE job after that, but was laid off in 2022 when our project was discontinued and am back on the helpdesk. Guess I was never meant to be a programmer lol. reply davidw 1 hour agoprevI have this sense that the world of tech needs the pendulum to swing back a bit towards geeky hacker types who are in it for the love of building cool things, tinkering, exploring and all that.

But what makes this any worse than Juicero, Clinkle, or Humane? Why does this rise to the level of Theranos? It has been a bubble now for 13 years. I disagree here. Maybe it's just the new normal? Comparisons between now the the '90s do not hold up. Tech companies today are much bigger, but also generating huge profits, unlike the 90s bubble, in which tech companies were much less profitable or unprofitable relative to valuations. lol \"people could raise ludicrous money\" What? Where? Funding rounds are much smaller, more competitive, and more selective today compared to in the 90s. Hardly anyone except for a few lucky people (like the founders of Coinbase or Dropbox) are getting rich overnight anymore, unlike in the 90s. Founders are being offered table scraps worth of funding compared to the generous, multi-million-dollar funding rounds that were common in the 90s. This is made worse by the fact that running a tech company is more expensive than ever in terms of the complexity of the product (interactive apps are waaaayyy harder to develop than a static html store) and marketing (everything is so expensive and saturated compared to the 90s. Ads are obscenely expensive today and full of click/viewer fraud and worthless, inflated metrics.) and labor costs (coders are much better paid today compared to the 90s relative to inflation). reply busterarm 2 hours agoparentPeople really forget what it was truly like in the 90s. If you could breathe and knew how to turn a computer on, you could get a job in tech. The hiring was that desperate and that easy. The fundraising was that easy too. Everyone just assumed that you even knew what a computer was that you could figure the rest out. That all changed with the Russian ruble crisis, which hit finance first late in '98 and then took another year for its effects to start hitting the tech industry hard. By 2001 the game was up and it really took until the 2010s to turn around. Actually in the late 00s and early 2010s it was actually really gross and sort of like crypto. I remember a lot of smooth talking dudes around NY who were raising all kinds of VC money and doing _nothing_ with it but finding shady ways to spend it on themselves/drugs. The money was free and the accountability was absent.

Wi-Fi has emerged as one of the most popular technologies for providing Internet access, but it is also frequently exploited by malicious actors to launch various attacks. With the deployment of wireless security mechanisms like WPA2/WPA3 and the adoption of other protective strategies such as Access Point (AP) isolation, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) protection, and rogue AP detection, off-path attackers (those unable to control the router) are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain confidential information of Wi-Fi users. Our recent discovery in router firmware exposes a security flaw in routers’ Network Address Translation (NAT) mapping handling, which can be exploited by attackers to bypass TCP’s built-in randomization. This facilitates off-path TCP hijacking attacks, intercepting Wi-Fi TCP traffic. Our research paper detailing the attack has been accepted by NDSS 2024, Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where an attacker and a victim client are connected to the same Wi-Fi network to access Internet services (for example, consider strangers connecting to the same Wi-Fi network of a coffee shop). For the attacker to hijack the TCP connection between the victim and the server offering common services such as social media or online finance, the attacker must detect the existence of the TCP connection first. Upon confirmation, the attacker then proceeds to infer the sequence and acknowledgment numbers of the ongoing bidirectional communication. Figure 1 — Threat model of TCP hijacking attacks in Wi-Fi networks. Attack steps We’ve observed that routers often employ port preservation strategies during NAT and lack reverse path validation as required by RFC 3704, enabling attackers to deduce the source ports of other client connections. In the first step, following the method illustrated in Figure 2, the attacker can deduce the source port of other clients by altering the source port numbers specified in the forged SYN and SYCK packets, then observing if it can receive the SYCK sent by itself until identifying the correct port used by the victim client for subsequent attacks. Figure 2 — Inferring the source port of the victim TCP connection. We’ve found that most routers, for performance reasons, do not rigorously inspect the sequence numbers of TCP packets. Consequently, this introduces serious security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit by crafting forged reset (RST) packets to maliciously clear NAT mappings in the router. In the second attack step, the attacker proceeds to steal the sequence number (SEQ) and acknowledgment number (ACK) of the normal TCP connection between the victim client and the server, as depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3 — Hijacking active connections. Once the attacker has obtained the source port, sequence number, and acknowledgment number used by the client connection, it can initiate TCP connection manipulation attacks. The TCP protocol is a critical foundational protocol of the Internet, carrying important network application protocols such as SSH, HTTP, and FTP. Therefore, hijacking attacks targeting TCP can be applied across various scenarios. For instance, SSH denial of service attacks, FTP private file downloads, and HTTP cache pollution, among others. Figure 4 illustrates the effect of an attacker poisoning a victim’s HTTP webpage. Figure 4 — Snapshots of web poisoning. Empirical study We conducted tests on 67 mainstream routers from 30 different manufacturers, including 360, Aruba, ASUS, Amazon, Cisco Meraki, China Mobile, Comfast, D-Link, GL.iNet, Google, H3C, Huawei, IP-COM, iKuai, JdCloud, Linksys, Mercury, Netgear, Netcore, Ruijie, Skyworth, Tenda, TP-Link, Ubiquiti, Volans, Wavlink, WiMaster, Xiaomi, ZTE, pfSense, and others. Among these, we found that 52 routers from 24 manufacturers were susceptible to this attack. The test results are illustrated in Table 1. Table 1 — Partially tested routers from 30 vendors. Additionally, we conducted measurement studies on 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks and found that 75 (81%) of them were susceptible to this attack. Our case studies indicate that terminating SSH connections, downloading private files from FTP servers, and injecting false HTTP response packets on average took 17.5, 19.4, and 54.5 seconds, respectively, with success rates of 87.4%, 82.6%, and 76.1%. The detailed experimental results are shown in the paper. Mitigation We have registered the issue to the affected manufacturers by submitting vulnerability reports and contacting them via email. As of now, we have received a positive response from the OpenWrt community, confirming our findings and releasing patches to fix the vulnerability. Additionally, seven router vendors (namely TP-Link, Huawei, Xiaomi, 360, Mercury, Ubiquiti, and Linksys) have acknowledged our report and are actively working to fix their products. Furthermore, we have been assigned 10 CVE identifiers for different vendors. Other vendors are still investigating the vulnerability. To mitigate this attack, we suggest three countermeasures: Random port allocation: Routers should employ a random selection strategy when creating new NAT mappings. Reverse path validation: Following the recommendation of RFC 3704, strict mode is utilized to filter out spoofed packets. In our testing, routers from ASUS, Netgear, ZTE, Aruba, Cisco Meraki, TP-LINK, and Mercury default to this recommendation, thus enhancing defence against our attacks. TCP window checking: We advocate for routers to rigorously inspect the sequence and acknowledgment numbers of received packets. OpenWrt has already implemented this mitigation after our disclosure.

Since the threat model is that the attacker and the victim are connected to the same router via the same wifi network, not isolated from each other, in a case where you are using wifi in psk for example, the attacker can already sniff everything from other clients. Therefore, you can spoof packets by just responding to them directly. It is a lot simpler and takes a lot less time (since you just need to respond faster than the server with the right seq and port numbers). Once you are in the same network you can do even crazier stuff like arp spoofing and then let the victim think that you are the router and convince it to send all of its packets to you (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) Edit: on a second thought, maybe in a use case where the victim and the attacker are in different wifi networks (or just configured to be isolated ), the attacker should be able to perform a denial of service for a specific ip:port by sending RST and then ACK with every possible source port. reply blahgeek 15 hours agoprevIs it common for routers to create a new mapping for TCP packets that is NOT SYN (in figure 3 in this article)?

For example, since SSH uses a trust on first use model as opposed to a central trust/web of trust model, they can direct the victim to a different SSH server if they're connecting to a new one, and intercept all traffic. (Edit: Even with HTTPS, there are other ways to MITM a connection because each trusted CA is considered an equal. For example, instead of doing a full-on MITM on a service which is likely to be detected[1], a better solution may be to obtain a certificate and target the specific user.)

(1) You need new host which hasn't been TOFU'd yet, and you need it to be exposed to internet with no VPN/mesh inbetween. (2) You need password-based authentication _or_ agent forwarding, otherwise you won't be able to intercept traffic (with key-based auth, you can pretend to be the server, but that won't likely to last long). While I would not say that everyone uses key-based ssh, they should! It's an easy way to significantly increase your SSH security level. As for HTTPs MITM, I don't see how this applies. They had to intercept traffic next to a server to be able to issue certificate - and I am pretty sure no one runs servers from the untrusted coffee shop connection! And you already have access to the server's datacenter, then there is no need to exploit public WiFi, you can intercept the server's traffic directly. reply tsimionescu 12 hours agorootparentThe HTTPS MITM case doesn't need to intercept close to the server, it just needs to know that Victim is trying to talk to a particular server. Then, they obtain a forged certificate, and use the same mechanism shown here to intercept the TLS ClientHello and pretend to be the TLS server, with the legitimate certificate. The reason this works is because in a targetted attack, it's much less likely that the improperly issued certificate would become public and (1) be revoked, and (2) cause problems for the CA that issued it. reply tjoff 12 hours agorootparentprev2: key based ssh won't really help and isn't the magic bullet people seem to believe. Especially nonencrypted ssh keys which is what the majority uses. reply theamk 3 hours agorootparentsure it is, as long as you don't have agent forwarding 1. The ssh connection is intercepted, malicious server lets accepts arbitrary user's public key 2. Malicious server tries to connect to real server and fails - original pubkey authentication was channel-bound and cannot be reused 3. Malicious server now has to pretend to be the real server without knowing what the real server looks like. User immediately detects the shell prompt is different, the hostname is wrong, all the files are missing, etc... and disconnects. (You can make some sort of contrived situation, like you only ssh'd to restart service, _and_ you used \"sudo\" with password _and_ you used ssh command so you didn't see the prompt _and_ this was the first command you did on your new computer... but this seems pretty unlikely) And encrypted vs non-encrypted keys seems completely unrelated to connection interception attacks - who cares how the keys are stored on the computer?

Or how I could tell? reply zootboy 16 hours agoparentWell, of the three mitigations suggested in the article: 1 - Random NAT port allocation Seems like the answer is \"not by default.\" According to iptables(8), SNAT defaults to using the pre-translated ports whenever possible, so it's up to the connecting client (victim's TCP stack) to randomly select source ports. There is a \"--to-ports\" option that lets you limit the usable source ports, but it's not mentioned how the ports are selected in that case. 2 - Reverse Path Validation I'm not really sure how this helps in the described situation. If the attacker and the victim are on the same wifi access point, then both of their traffic will be sourced from the same network interface, so even strict RFC 3704 validation will pass for spoofed packets from the attacker. But for completeness, you can turn that on by setting a sysctl (rp_filter = 1). 3 - TCP window checking I _believe_ that the vanilla linux kernel does check this by default, as the mentioned adjustments to OpenWRT seem to be removing a non-standard option to disable the TCP window checking https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/75e78bcaab847557ce... reply aidenn0 3 hours agorootparentFor those looking for rp_filter it is net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter (or replace \"all\" with a device name to turn it on for just one device). reply fanf2 7 hours agorootparentprevThe attack uses packets sent from the WiFi side to the WAN IP address, which is what reverse path filtering prevents. reply zootboy 3 hours agorootparentAh, yes, that's the detail I missed for why #2 is relevant. So the answer to #2 is \"not by default, but easy to enable.\" Though other comment threads here have discussed the potential for this to impact NAT hole punching. reply lathiat 16 hours agoparentprevI would have assumed linux conntrack to do more rigorous \"tcp window checking\" as an assumption, however the article also notes they received a positive response from OpenWRT who implemented a mitigation, so I am curious to see the details of that mitigation. reply taneliv 13 hours agorootparentAs user zootboy above comments, OpenWRT removed a patch from their kernels that introduced a \"no window checking\" option for TCP processing,[1] which I suppose was enabled by default. [1] https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/75e78bcaab847557ce... reply xxpor 1 hour agorootparentNote that this means that conntrack's window tracking has to be perfectly in sync with both endpoints (assuming TCP invalids are dropped). Given endpoints tend to be updated more often than middleboxes, this isn't a great assumption to make. reply Joel_Mckay 16 hours agoparentprevIn general there are usually rules that prevent cross-forwarding traffic, and thus traffic over wifi is isolated from each client (unless you need to share a home NAS/printer this should remain enabled.) Most if not all modern routers have this feature, and also the ability to turn off the dumpster-fire that is UPnP and flaky port-trigger mods. Additionally, some add packet marking rules, which is often also used to enforce fair bandwidth sharing. Yet note this can be a nonstandard controversial gray-area. One could also use a private cert based VPN + Kerberos with firewall client pre-set rules on any un-trusted/open access points.

    "originBody": "Enabling & Support Monitoring marine litter from space is now a reality 19/06/2024 12585 views 14 likes ESA / Enabling & Support / Space Engineering & Technology Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Where it goes after that remains largely unknown. But a new ESA Discovery study reported in Nature Communications has proven the concept of monitoring floating plastic litter using satellites. Drone view of litter windrow The quantity of plastic floating on the sea surface is rarely high enough to generate a detectable signal from space. Plastics and other floating debris have to accumulate into dense patches of at least tens of metres in area to be detectable using existing satellites. These patches of floating litter are called ‘slicks’, ‘streaks’ or ‘litter windrows’. They are often filament-shaped, resulting from the presence of convergence current lines on the sea surface. Detecting such litter windrows is indicative of high pollution at a particular place and time. But could such scattered and short-lived patches of litter provide sufficiently useful data for global monitoring of plastic pollution? Litter windrow detected by satellite “We didn’t know if the abundance of litter windrows was enough to draw maps, or to reveal trends over time,” notes Andrés Cózar, from the University of Cádiz, co-director of the project. To find out ESA Discovery funded a consortium of space companies and research institutes from six countries. Using a six-year historical series of 300 000 satellite images, the team scanned the entire Mediterranean Sea every three days, at a spatial resolution of 10 metres, on the hunt for windrows. They relied on the multispectral imaging Sentinel-2 satellites of Europe’s Copernicus programme, which while not designed for litter detection, have a somewhat limited capability for plastic detection. Mediterranean marine litter mapped by satellite “Searching for litter aggregations of metres in size on the ocean surface is like looking for needles in a haystack,” explains Manuel Arias, from the Institute of Marine Sciences, CSIC, in Spain, the other project co-director. Automation was what made the project possible, harnessing supercomputers and advanced search algorithms. The team found thousands of litter windrows, most more than a kilometre long – and some reaching 20 km in length. The result was the most complete map of marine litter pollution to date. “Litter detections with a non-specialised satellite allowed us to identify the most polluted areas and their major changes over weeks and years,” comments Andrés Cózar. “Litter is injected into the Mediterranean Sea as the rainstorms rage.” Sentinel-2 A key element of this work has been in understanding the significance of the litter windrow structures in the context of marine monitoring, being mainly associated with land-based litter emissions in the preceding days. This makes them especially useful for surveillance and management of the problem. In the paper the team assess the effectiveness of action plans against marine litter around Rome, identify a pollution hotspot related to shipping through the Egypt’s Suez Canal and put forward satellite data for guiding cleanup operations in Spain’s Bay of Biscay. Manuel Arias explains: “The tool is ready to be used in other world regions, which I am convinced will teach us much about the littering phenomenon, including identification of sources and the pathways to the ocean.” Satellite litter map with rivers and drainage basins Andrés Cózar adds: “There is still room for improvement. The sensor used in our proof was not designed to detect plastic. Detection capability would be enormously improved if we put observation technology into orbit tailored for ocean plastics.” The ability to monitor marine litter pollution in this way also holds broader promise. The deployment of a sensor specifically dedicated to detect and identify floating objects one metre in size could also be useful for tasks such as oil spill monitoring, loss of cargo or even search and rescue at sea. Paolo Corradi, overseeing the project for ESA Discovery, comments: “The importance of these results and the applicability of this methodology can indeed be extended in a wider sense to the monitoring and characterisation of generic floating matter accumulations. This could be the more general target of a dedicated small satellite mission, which would collect the interest of a large scientific community, while addressing the need for large scale monitoring of marine litter pollution.” “ESA Discovery is our funding programme to ensure our Agency is ready for tomorrow, looking into future ways we might make use of space,” comments Dietmar Pilz, ESA Director of Technology, Engineering and Quality. “The potential detection of marine plastic litter has been a topic of interest for a number of years within ESA Discovery. I am pleased to see this work has resulted in such a landmark scientific paper, exploiting the incredible value of the data from Europe’s Copernicus satellites.” Detections in lagoons and coastal areas Along with the University of Cadiz and CSIC, the team is composed of researchers from ESA; ARGANS in France and UK; Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Spain; the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, ISMAR-CNR, in Italy; the Technical University of Crete in Greece; Airbus Defence and Space in France; the Joint Research Centre, JRC, of the European Commission, The Ocean Cleanup in the Netherlands; and ACRI-ST in France. The study was funded by ESA and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Global Litter Observatory, ref. CTM2016-77106-R/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033/ European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR).

Plenty of groups taking money to deal with it (or not) and part of that is to advertise the issue to ensure more money keeps coming into this industry. There is are no large international organizations or government efforts going out there to remove all the trash outside the more commercial or industrial parts of town, no ones buying ads about it, so its not in the public awareness as much. It also doesn't help that over time people grow blind to it.

Otherwise, the manufactures will keep making devices/items with built-in-obsolescence to make it 'fashionable' for consumers to replace them at the first opportunity. reply kjkjadksj 54 minutes agoparentThey need to work out a way for the costs to actually go towards targeted local cleanup operations which is no easy feat considering you need to extract them from all of society that produces trash. You'd have to create probably a new government agency that staffs cities with sufficient trash pickup. It would probably be in the billions in labor considering trash is often just as prolific in a tiny town of 400 people as it is in the big cities. What would be perhaps more realistic is regulating packaging and other materials such that they can degrade safely in place with the assumption they will be littered and not properly recycled. reply barbazoo 2 hours agoparentprevWhen I buy packaged groceries I often decide whether I'll buy it again based on the packaging used.

Now the other day I went to my ethnic neigborhood store that I usually only buy veggies from but this time I got some imported roti breads and good lord, the amount of plastic they use is just insane. It opened my eyes to the fact that probably the vast majority of the world still packages their food like there's no tomorrow. Every roti was wrapped in 2 sheets of plastic, packaged in a bag of plastic. 5 rotis in bags in another bag, 5 bags of those in the large bag you see in the store.

But I guess the chemistry behind all of this is beyond me.

In a little while I plan to redo the entire graphic interface, and yes a method to make it clearer when the microphone is listening is already in the plans.

I’m a believer in native software (I write native software). I think it results in much higher Quality user experience, than hybrid development. There’s a reason that it’s not super-popular, though. It’s a fair bit more expensive than hybrid approaches, and generally requires a higher skill level, as well. Most companies find that hybrid approaches are “good enough,” and they make much better margins. That said, you could probably test it, using the Xcode Simulator. It’s gotten pretty good with I/O, lately. Bluetooth still requires a physical device, but most of the stuff could probably be tested fine, if you used a modular approach (my preferred methodology). reply niedev 8 hours agorootparentYes I agree with you, moreover for now I am much better as a Java or C developer than as a web developer, so for me the native approach is also simpler.

Nuclear power isn't about achieving the lofty heights of the 1970s. I'm just going to wave the famous article by Crawford on the economics of nuclear around: https://rootsofprogress.org/devanney-on-the-nuclear-flop [0] What you can see there is a very impressive learning curve that was well on the way to very cheap electricity. Then it suddenly and sharply inverts in a shape that defies common sense. Then no-one else really builds any. \"Supporting nuclear\" isn't supposed to mean splitting the atom at any cost. The point is if we would just stop regulating the industry into oblivion and let costs drop then it'd be a perfectly competitive form of power. We have this lobby that goes in, wrecks the economics of nuclear then uses the wreck they created as justification for why we can't build any more. And in some senses that is fair because if they had the power to destroy past nuclear projects they can do it again. But lets not pretend that these costs are fundamental to nuclear. Keeping a weather eye on China, if they do their usual trick and start learning how to build nuclear cheaply they could leapfrog everyone else on energy tech in another industry. On the one hand that'd be fantastic to the point where I'd love it. On the other it is so frustrating to be relying on nominal communists to push the state of the art forward on energy technology after listening to my western compatriots whinge about exactly that topic for decades while blocking the obvious solutions. We could have built the future in the west, we never had to have a do-it-in-China policy. [0] If you read the article, he's paraphrasing some book by someone called Devanney.

That already significantly eats into the margins before you consider the ~500 person workforce required to maintain such a complex system 24/7 365. The physical degradation of equipment like pumps, turbines, and lightbulbs costs yet more money. Decommissioning again yet more costs. People focus on the upfront construction costs because they are extreme, but even if construction costs were the same as a coal power plant nuclear electricity would still be quite expensive. Further, many things like the initial fuel supply get lumped under ‘construction costs’ but are better thought of as something else like operating expenses. reply roenxi 14 hours agorootparentIt is an argument based mainly on learning rates. He doesn't need to know any details about the economic model of nuclear; the observations are based on the economic model changing over time. > The baseline cost of fuel rods alone ends up being ~0.9c/kWh. I saw a quote from the 4th generation reactor wiki page (it came up while people were talking about China getting started on the build out of next gen of nuclear tech) that mentioned \"100–300x energy yield from the same amount of nuclear fuel\" as a potential advantage. People will figure out how to make fuel rods cheaper. We haven't really pushed the limits of this stuff. Besides, even in the current climate 1c/kWh is still a great lower bound to aspire for. Possibly even that would be worth pushing through the political blowback for. reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentGen IV doesn’t mean anything specifically. No individual gen IV designs has every single advantage you see in any of those designs. You need to look at a specific designs in isolation as well as what trade offs are involved in that design. “100-300x energy yield from the same amount of nuclear fuel” That’s one of those things that sounds good in isolation, but ends up being more expensive. It’s just like CANDU reactors don’t need enrichment and can operate on natural uranium, but it turns out fuel costs drop by 20% when they started enriching the fuel. Similarly LWR/HWR could make better use of their fuel if they could operate at higher temperatures, but that causes a world of other problems. Unfortunately nuclear engineers aren’t dumb, they’re doing things for surprisingly solid reasons even if counter intuitive reasons. reply kragen 14 hours agorootparentprevi'm not convinced that the fuel is inherently that expensive; plausibly a lot of that cost is unnecessary bureaucracy and antiproliferation costs. i think the killer is your point, 'even if construction costs were the same as a coal power plant' reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentAgain when you dig into things some things are inherently extremely expensive like operating a lot of gas diffusion centrifuges. You could cut fuel use in half if the thermal efficiency of nuclear increased to that of a combined cycle coal power plant. But having two water loops (or a liquid salt then water etc) inherently reduces the temperatures the second loop reaches compared to the primary loop. On top of this you want to stay well away from material limits for safety concerns. Net result the maximum Carnot efficiency is only like 45% and achieved efficiency is significantly lower than that. reply defrost 14 hours agorootparentprev> Keeping a weather eye on China, if they do their usual trick and start learning how to build nuclear cheaply Well, that ship has apparently sailed already: How innovative is China in nuclear power?

Currently coal still accounts for nearly 60% of China's electricity. The vast bulk of global solar production comes from China and the bulk of that production of solar panels is being carried by coal power underpinning the required energy demands. Go on, say solar again. Act like I have no idea and that saying solar again will change something about the current state of China's energy supply and demand, their plans for the future and my current understanding of those plans. > i think the reason they're building nuclear plants is the same reason so many nuclear plants were built during the cold war: to build nuclear weapons There's also having consistent reliable baseload power for 24|7|365 day industry and personal use which they intend to achieve with a lot of solar and somewhat less nuclear. reply kragen 12 hours agorootparentsolar ;) reply roenxi 14 hours agorootparentprevWho cares? If solar is cheap people can build solar. That isn't a particularly controversial idea. When coal was cheaper coal plants got built, when gas was cheaper people built gas plants. When solar is cheap we can build solar farms. The issue is that nuclear has the potential to to shift society's energy costs 2+ orders of magnitude cheaper and we're explicitly retarding its progress by policy. Apparently only because of irrational beliefs. reply kragen 13 hours agorootparenthmm, so, if i get a 360-watt solar module for 30 dollars and set it up someplace with a 30% capacity factor (like in the north of argentina where it's sunny) it will produce an average of 110 watts, which is 950 kilowatt hours per year. if i demand a 10% return on my investment, i'm getting 950 kilowatt hours for 3 dollars, which is 0.3¢ per kilowatt hour this is already better than wholesale electrical prices, which average about 4¢ per kilowatt hour, but of course that involves all kinds of auxiliary equipment and batteries and whatnot. so let's assume generously that you're saying that nuclear energy has the potential to produce electricity for a wholesale price of 0.004¢ per kilowatt hour, which would be 2 orders of magnitude cheaper why would you think that it has that potential? you cited crawford and devanney, but they don't say anything that even suggests that they think that. at the extreme they think that you can get those same 360 watts from nuclear power for 360 dollars. what are you basing your estimate on? reply roenxi 13 hours agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#In_nuclear_reac... - the difference in energy density from coal to uranium alone is absurd, let alone if we have some breakthrough that taps in to a more exotic substance. It isn't that much harder to mine these fuels, the only problem is that we haven't really squeezed down the cost of building those honking great plants and focused on making the whole supply chain cheap. We're talking potentials like 6 orders of magnitude improvement over coal (which is currently competitive enough to run an industrial society). We should be giving the nuclear industry as many opportunities as possible to achieve breakthroughs, not limiting it. reply kragen 12 hours agorootparentyes, clearly that is correct when it comes to spacecraft, where what matters is energy density; voyager 1 would not be transmitting to us today if it were powered by kerosene or solar panels. but, here on earth, operating power plants is generally not an expense in proportion to how much their fuel weighs. only about half of the cost of a coal power plant is the coal; the other half is the plant, with its spinning electromagnets, parsons turbines, deionized supercritical steam circuit, cooling towers, and so on. as long as you're using nuclear power as an alternative way to drive steam through the coal-plant machinery, the best you can do is knock the cost down by a factor of about 2, which is 0.3 orders of magnitude rather than 2+ also, by the way, if you can come up with a heat engine that's cheaper by one or more orders of magnitude, you can compete with photovoltaic power plants using not just nuclear energy but also concentrating solar and geothermal. that would be a huge boon reply roenxi 12 hours agorootparent> but, here on earth... Well, yeah. If you assume we keep doing everything the same as we do right now, we'll get similar results to what we are getting right now. You've put your finger on the core issue with that paragraph, but I suspect not in the way you intended. What you're not dealing with is that the likelihood we figure out alternative ways of doing things is extremely high. Or it would be if we didn't have a brain-dead regulatory state in the West that blocks us from doing things differently. We're talking a fuel source where we can fit the energy equivalent of 10 trains of coal into an 2L ice cream container - assuming no improvements from using Uranium. There aren't any laws of physics saying it has to be expensive to turn that into useful energy. We haven't really tested any part of the industrial supply chain to see how low costs can go. And any ideas the academics are having aren't being put in to the practice - or at least they weren't until the best and brightest over in China started getting involved. Hopefully it works out. Not to mention that, as you point out, nuclear is also a technically superior form of energy in a bunch of specific applications where weight and volume are factors. reply kragen 11 hours agorootparenti agree! reply loeg 13 hours agorootparentprevThere's a big handwave at \"an average of 110 watts.\" There will be periods where it generates 0. Does that line up with demand? How will you satisfy demand at night? Solving that is the majority of the costs of solar/wind. The cost of the panels is almost insignificant. reply kragen 12 hours agorootparentcurrently the cost of the panels and balance of plant, not batteries, is the majority of the costs of solar power. the panels have historically been about ⅓ and are edging up past ½ of the total. batteries are not insignificant but also not overwhelming. obviously the amount of battery needed is dependent on demand patterns see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40725765 for me trying to quantify this better reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentprevit would be a perfectly competitive form of power by 01970s standards, but naval nuclear reactors, chinese nuclear reactors, and russian nuclear reactors are not regulated into oblivion and have not had their economics wrecked by lobbying. nevertheless, they remain more expensive and less economical than even fossil-fuel plants in both warships and china. conceivably capitalism could solve that problem (us defense contractors and chinese power plant builders are pretty tightly state-linked rather than free-market actors) but we don't have strong reasons for believing so crawford here talks optimistically about building nuclear plants for 250¢ per (nameplate) watt. europe and india are already building solar farms for 60¢ per (peak, nameplate) watt, a cost that is dropping dramatically year by year. he does plot some plants being built that cheaply in the 01960s in the us, in inflation-adjusted 02010 dollars, but for some reason he doesn't comment on that, and he doesn't find anyone able to do anything like that in recent years; the 'building cheaply' he cites in south korea and india is 190¢–250¢ per watt. this suggests that perhaps either the inflation adjustment or the original cost figures are incorrect solar does of course have a lower capacity factor than nuclear, but there are numerous countries where it's 30% or better, so 60¢ per peak watt is still less than 200¢ per long-term average watt. also 60¢ today is 41¢ in the 02010 dollars crawford is using: https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=60&year1=20240... i sympathize with crawford's leanings but even the most generous reading of his claims doesn't support the contention that nuclear can be built cheaply enough to compete with solar reply XorNot 14 hours agorootparentNone of those watts are dispatchable though. A solar plant can't look ahead a month and bid a block of kWh on any given day with any confidence. Solar and Wind in \"price per watt\" are meaningless when storage is not accounted for. In fact a huge chunk of their actual cost of power has to be buying contracts for the backup plants to provide the kWh they want to promise but may not be able to deliver (hence the true cost of a kWh from a solar plant is basically whatever it would cost a gas plant to produce it). reply roenxi 13 hours agorootparentThe quality isn't the same, but price is its own reward. We'll learn how to shift a lot of industrial production around if the price goes low enough. Watt-for-watt dispatchable is superior, but for half price there are probably a lot of uses that will turn out to be quite flexible. The energy markets don't appear to have quite gotten to the point where they handle that flexibility (prices keep dipping negative, which is unfortunate if you understand what that implies), but it is reasonable to expect that it is coming. reply dev_tty01 4 hours agorootparent>We'll learn how to shift a lot of industrial production around if the price goes low enough. Are you going to send everyone home on overcast days? What if production needs to run 24/7? Solar is a whole solution if and only if storage is solved on a massive scale. Even with adequate storage, it still isn't going to work in some parts of the world or during certain seasons. In the end, I think we need a mix of energy sources and working to make nuclear cost effective is part of a practical low carbon energy future. I just don't understand the confrontational nature of the solar vs. nuclear argument. Solar is absolutely going to be a huge part of our energy future.

Yes, a lot of people who install residential solar have a battery, and \"common wisdom\" tends to size the battery up if the solar install is larger. But nothing stops the battery being really small, or indeed (like commercial solar generation) there being no battery at all. Yes, of course, solar is not 24 hours. But having cheap energy \"only\" half the day (1) is a major plus. And as energy cost fluctuates, so do habits. For example since we got solar we tend to use the dishwasher in the mid morning instead of at night. (1) actual solar availability depends on the width of your country. For example solar plants in say Arizona happily generate good power while the East coast is dark, and panels in say Florida would cater for mornings in California.

This is common. It is of course due to the cost of battery systems, particularly if the solar system was installed several years ago. I just bought a house that has solar and not only does it not have battery storage, but the solar cannot power the house when grid power is down. Seems insane to me to build a system that can't bootstrap from the solar and run things on an as available basis during outages but apparently this is typical. I'm still learning, but I also think that I am not getting great value for the power I am supplying to the grid during the day. Add to that the extra cost of power during peak evening hours when I don't have solar and a battery to time shift my solar for my own use during the evening seems like a win.

The electrical cost for these us now zero (on most days.) Our night-time electricity usage has gone down because it's more expensive. When energy costs the same all 24 hours then it's not something I take into consideration. When it's different habits change. I don't use less energy, if anything I use more.

You better believe I avoid doing things like laundry or running the dishwasher then, and opt to run them earlier in the day or later at night. If I had solar (without battery storage), I'd absolutely be running my heavier electric load when the sun's out instead of at night when I have to pay for power.

And due to the nature of radioactive half-life, the second half of the uranium will not lose its radiation until many millions of years more than the first half required. Edit: not my downvote btw reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentprevit seems implausible that a nuclear power plant occupies 0.01% of the space of a battery bank of the same peak power capacity; if anything, i'd suspect the discrepancy is closer to the other way around (edit: it is, see the comment below where i do the math, and please stop posting thoughtless bullshit) if you were talking about the solar farm, then yeah, i'd agree reply zeofig 14 hours agorootparentIf that seems implausible you might want to replause your seemometer. A nuclear plant has much higher energy density than any battery. reply kragen 14 hours agorootparentwell, nuclear fuel rods certainly have much higher energy density than any battery. but they're only a small piece of the power plant, and i wasn't talking about the energy density (joules per liter) but the power density (watts per liter or, since we're talking about land use, watts per square meter) a 10c 2000 milliamp hour 18650 cell produces 20 amps at nominally 3.7 volts, which is 74 watts. if it occupies 18 mm × 18 mm × 65 mm that's 3500 watts per liter. tepco's kashiwazaki-kariwa nuclear power plant is 8 gigawatts, which is 2300 cubic meters of 18650s. if you stack them two meters high, that's 1100 square meters, an area 34 meters square. maybe you have to double that so you can drive a forklift in between the racks of batteries, plus you need some space for things like fireproof bulkheads, wiring, and inverters, but we're talking about maybe 50 meters by 50 meters, 0.0025km². kashiwazaki-kariwa is 4.2km², 1600 times bigger. (also, it's more than two meters tall.) the hypothetical 8-gigawatt battery bank uses 0.06% of the land area. even if you scale up the discharge time from 6 minutes to the usual 4 hours, it's still only 2.4% of the area of the nuclear plant you can get better batteries than that, too. and if you're worried about land consumption, as you have to be in japan, you can put your batteries in a building with multiple floors reply jaggederest 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you think batteries are getting more expensive over time? reply XorNot 14 hours agorootparentI think the assumption they would get cheaper given a massive change in their adoption patterns is unfounded. We know that lithium prices have gone up from the rise in EVs, and this has in part driven Tesla to switch to LiFePO4's rather then Li-Ion packs in some of their cars. Same effect with coltan. (although lithium is declining currently because EV sales in China have slowed). What would be the effect of the demand for terawatt-hour levels of batteries? Even if lithium is replaced with sodium in the application, the manufacturing capacity isn't there and won't be for quite some time - and the higher-value applications will get first take (i.e. EVs). Even if the lithium demand was saturated battery wise, at the steady state point the cost can then simply stabilize around the refurbisment/recycling cost of lithium/sodium/whatever from batteries. Sigmoidal adoption curves look exponential at the start, linear in the middle,and then become asymptotically flat. reply kragen 14 hours agorootparent> although lithium is declining currently because EV sales in China have slowed have they?

What do we get if we look at say, FLOPS per US $ over time? This[2]. There is no reason to think batteries are any different, the only margin you have is to argue over which part of the curve you think we're in. A sigmoid curve[3].

I'm not sure it makes the point you're trying to make. reply fuzzfactor 12 hours agorootparentprev>Solar power is not. Often there is no battery, but regardless when solar cost goes up it could be due to expensive contractors in-between the panels and the installation & maintenance, before the lightbulb even gets a chance to see a single watt. reply kragen 11 hours agorootparenta major reason in the usa is the tariff regime that has basically completely shut out chinese solar panels from the market; this makes solar panels in the us cost about twice as much as in the rest of the world reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentprevsolar power is getting cheaper by the day; https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/04/19/europes-renewable-ppa... says: > Energy consultancy LevelTen says that solar power purchase agreement (PPA) prices fell 5.9% in the first quarter of 2024, with decreases recorded in all analyzed countries except for Romania. It attributes the decline to lower wholesale electricity prices and a fall in solar module prices however, they haven't yet recovered to the 02020 levels, presumably because the astounding precipitous fall in module prices over the last year hasn't been priced in yet reply jaggederest 15 hours agoparentprevYeah solar is inevitably going to dominate the grid mix over the next couple decades. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61424 Even if you discount by capacity factor it's the #1 new energy source being installed in the US, and similar or better anywhere with enough sun. I've done some armchair analysis that says that solar plus battery is cheaper than basically any other kind of new plant, obviously the biggest gains come first in peaking and adaptive load, but once you factor in fuel costs it even beats out natural gas now I think. reply Jensson 16 hours agoparentprevYou do realize solar isn't viable in norther parts, due to peak demand being during cold winters and just less sun in general? Solar is great in the south where peak demand is during the warm sunny summers. reply njovin 14 hours agorootparentEven in the southwest this is a problem - peak output from residential rooftop solar is mid-day but peak demand is early evening when people are getting home, cooking dinner, charging their EVs, etc. Without some major changes to residential storage or large grid-attached storage systems, solar alone isn't going to cut it. reply ZeroGravitas 9 hours agorootparentDon't get confused by peak net-demand i.e. demand that is left after you subtract solar. The newly cheap midday power should be driving demand towards that time period but it won't show up on net demand charts, which will show the famous duck curve belly at that time. That doesn't mean people aren't using energy at that time. In fact the main way to detect this demand shift in a net demand graph is to see that the evening peaks are dropping year over year, even as they seem relatively larger compared with net demand when solar is working. But anyway, in California the massive deployment of batteries in the last few years has already solved this problem. Compared with peaking gas plants that only run once a day for a few hours batteries are both cheap and clean. reply bruce511 15 hours agorootparentprevI'd agree. Clearly solar is sun-dependent, and other options may be more suited to other locations. That said, electricity is one form of energy that is really cheap to distribute (once you are close to \"the grid\".) Which means that moving electricity from sunny places to darker corners is very practical. There are some economics in play. Remote populations (like on islands, or in Alaska) are unlikely to be connected anytime soon. These populations are generally dependent on coal. Nuclear might be appealing, but refueling nuclear takes time. So if it's your only electrical source, you need two reactors, each capable of supplying enough power. And of course the expertise to run it (expertise possibly harder to find in far-north Alaska.) Ultimately diesel is likely to remain the fuel of choice for small communities because engines are cheap, fuel is easily transported, and expertise is local. reply kragen 14 hours agorootparentincidentally i don't think it's true that engines are cheap; diesel-engine generators seem to be on the order of 100¢ per watt, while pv modules are 8¢ per watt and falling. at least, at the few-kilowatts level where i've been able to find prices. maybe wärtsilä's multi-megawatt diesel power plants are cheaper per watt but they don't seem to publish a price list maybe you just mean that diesels and especially otto engines scale down to smaller scales than nuclear or coal power plants? reply EasyMark 15 hours agorootparentprevRefueling is why you build more capacity than you need. It’s not like you have to “refuel” every night. It’s also not 1 for 1 (1 running, 1 “waiting”) reply bruce511 15 hours agorootparentIt kinda is though because refueling is a long job. Typically in the order of weeks. I'm not sure most communities would enjoy running on no power, or limited power for some number of weeks every couple years. And sure, maybe \"fast refueling \" gets built into new designs. A day or two is likely the longest you can tolerate though. Obviously that's before we consider other concerns of being dependent on a single source. I'm not sure living in remote Alaska, being dependent on a single complex machine for power is an ideal situation. reply mlindner 15 hours agorootparentprevI think you're underestimating the costs of transporting power long distances. reply bruce511 15 hours agorootparentThere are losses, sure. And yes it requires infrastructure to be built. Unlike an oil pipeline there's no possibility of spilling, or blocking wildlife. And the costs are tiny compared to trucking oil or coal around. reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentprevi edited that into my comment while you were writing yours, yeah. norway and finland have capacity factors of 6% for solar (compared to 30% here and 21% in the usa) and north of the arctic circle you'd need enough batteries to power you all winter long (though if i did my calculations correctly, it turns out that total yearly insolation rises after you cross the arctic circle) this is why scandinavian countries are using a lot more hydro and wind than solar. wind and especially hydro are cheaper even than solar, but wind and especially hydro are much more limited resources still, consider a counterfactual where somehow norway had to satisfy all its energy demand from solar. they burn 78.8 million barrels of oil per year, which is 15.3 gigawatts. they consume 124.29 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, which is 14.18 gigawatts (already over 95% hydro and wind, with no significant nuclear or solar component). they burn 3.98 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, which at .0364 megajoules per liter is 4.59 gigawatts. all of these together (assuming no overlap) are 34.1 gigawatts, and over 5.55 million norwegians, that's 6.1 kilowatts per norwegian. (if that sounds like a lot more than your house uses, that's probably more because most of it is used by transport and heavy industry than because norwegians have to heat their houses more.) 34 gigawatts divided by a 6% capacity factor is 570 gigawatts of solar cell nameplate capacity you'd need. at 02021 german costs of €0.60 per (nameplate, peak) watt of utility-scale solar, (including modules, inverters, permitting, inspection, customer acquisition, etc.; see slide 48 of the fraunhofer deck linked above) this would cost €340 billion, about 8 months of norway's gdp. if you could only spend 5% of their gdp on the transition, you could get it done in about 15 years, maybe 25 if you need batteries of course it's unnecessary because norway is already renewables-powered! but my point is that solar cells are now so cheap that they're a viable power source even in ridiculously polar countries. incidentally, they now cost half what they did in 02021, so the price would be a lot less now antarctica is much more interesting than the arctic, though, since there's land there reply natmaka 14 hours agorootparentWhere solar isn't adequate wind is often strong.

Even in more southern areas generation during winter is lower, then pay the massive loss of transmitting that so far north and it is no longer viable. reply kragen 15 hours agorootparenthvdc transmission doesn't have massive losses from transmitting long distances, so you could literally transmit power from the tropics or even the other hemisphere. but overprovisioning solar locally is probably cheaper reply wait_a_minute 14 hours agorootparentAre there hvdc transmission lines already spanning those kinds of distances? How much raw material and upkeep does that require? If over-provisioning solar, how much more surface area would be needed to have the solar? Seems like the additional costs would pile up to get to current energy needs being met by just solar. reply kragen 13 hours agorootparentyou'll probably be interested in reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current. it says typical losses are 3.5% per 1000km, and typical voltages are 100–800 kilovolts, but china built a 12-gigawatt 1100-kilovolt link over 3300km in 02019 unfortunately i don't have a good handle on how efficient that link is. the numbers above suggest it would be about 89% efficient, but those are for lower-voltage systems in general you expect the resistive losses in the cables, at a given diameter and power, to scale with the inverse square of the voltage, so an 1100-kilovolt link should have 47% less resistive losses than an 800-kilovolt link at the same power level running over the same cables. however, corona-discharge losses increase at higher voltages rather than decreasing, and i don't know which one is dominant. so i don't know if that link is closer to 89% efficient or closer to 95% efficient the distance from the north or south pole to the equator is of course 10000 km, but people don't build very near the poles. for example, from svalbard to algiers is 4700 km. so, yeah, there are hvdc transmission lines already spanning those kinds of distances, but not quite that far yet transmission lines require utterly insignificant quantities of raw material, but where they cut through forested terrain, they do require upkeep. in the meeting of a tree and a megavolt, neither one comes out unscathed for some calculations on how much you need to over-provision solar, see my earlier comment at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40724349 considering a counterfactual where somehow norway had to use solar. 6.1 average kilowatts per norwegian at a capacity factor of 6% works out to 102 kilowatts peak per norwegian. if you're using low-cost 16%-efficient solar panels (as i assumed you would in my cost estimate, even though mostly people spring for the more efficient 'mainstream' ones) that would require 635 kilowatts of sunlight per norwegian, which is 635 square meters per norwegian (we rate solar panels on the assumption that sunlight is 1000 watts per square meter). 635 square meters is 25 meters square, .000635 square kilometers per norwegian. multiplying that by 5.5 million norwegians gives you the truly immense area of 3500 square kilometers of solar panels but wait! that's not all! you can't just lay the panels out flat on the ground and expect them to get a 6% capacity factor. you have to angle them toward the equator and spread them out so they don't shade each other. oslo is at 60° north, so your panels need to be angled at 60° from the horizontal, toward the south. maybe a bit more if you want to increase power production in winter, say 69°. so you have to space them out by 1/cos 69° ≈ 2.8. so actually you need 9800 square kilometers for your €340 billion of solar panels. how much space will you have left? a lot, it turns out. norway is 385000 square kilometers, so this is still just 2.5% of the country so norway, despite being the #2 highest user of energy per capita in the world after canada, and having cities that are literally inside the arctic circle, could switch to all solar. it's totally feasible. fortunately they have plenty of hydropower and wind so they don't need to reply autoexecbat 15 hours agorootparentprevSome transmission issues are solved by local generation reply Heston 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's definitely a generation issue. When there's no sun(overcast, nighttime) there's no energy. This doesn't even factor in solars quick deterioration from peak performance and the cost of the panels and environment damage from producing them. reply wait_a_minute 14 hours agorootparentYeah, I think people looking at just the upfront cost are not really acknowledging or addressing that solar panel installations degrade faster than a nuclear reactor. They also take up more space and as you mentioned will likely end up causing more damage to produce at planetary scale. They are definitely great when coupled with batteries for many use cases including decentralizing aspects of the grid for residential and smaller scale usages, but the raw performance of nuclear is impressive and exciting. So little inputs needed for how much you get, and for how long too. There are old reactors still producing after over 50 years…that is mind-boggling. Who knows how far the tech can be pushed with modern advancements and less blockers on developing the technology further. It should be in the toolbox as part of a strategy for renewable energy needs on Earth and beyond. reply kragen 14 hours agorootparentnuclear energy is very exciting and absolutely crucial for space exploration, but not economically competitive with solar in the foreseeable future on earth's surface there are also solar panels still producing power after 50 years; they do degrade a little, especially in the first ten years, but the 20–30 year panel lifetimes you see published are more of a warranty and accounting issue than anything else. (of course some panels crack or yellow within a year or two) it's true that solar farms take up a lot of space, but even in high-density countries like japan there is room for them. singapore might have a problem tho reply wait_a_minute 14 hours agorootparentWhat would surface area needs be like for over-provisioning needs in the US? What if we want to scale energy production by 2x or 10x or 100x for advanced industrial and commercial usage needs in the future? I think then the solar panel approach becomes limited on earth. You’re right that the panels don’t degrade a ton. I read online that after 20-30 years they might drop 15% efficiency. For residential usage that might be okay, but it does mean needing upkeep and worrying about baseline potential dropping, which in some climates could be bad. I do think a combination of the technologies is best, since scaling up energy production will be simpler and easier and more resource-friendly with nuclear than with more solar. Moving up the Kardashev scale will require capturing all the energy that can be captured from all sources so why let any go to waste. :) reply kragen 13 hours agorootparentyes, as you approach kardashev type 1 you will definitely want to start harvesting sunlight from von neumann probes on solar orbit including transportation, natural gas, etc., but not including foods like corn and canola, the usa uses 100 quads per year, or 3.3 terawatts in si units. its average utility-scale solar power capacity factor is 21%, so you'd need 15.7 terawatts peak of solar farms to supply that, before scaling up by 2× or 10× or 100×. 15.7 terawatts of 24% efficient solar panels would require 65 terawatts of sunlight, which is to say, 65 billion square meters or 65536 square kilometers (to pick a round number). this is of course 256², so, like the entire spectrum of mainstream political opinion in the usa, it would all fit between houston and austin. you could drive around it in a day well, not quite; that's 29° latitude, so you need to space your panels apart by a factor of 1/cos 29°, about 14%, so they don't shade each other. also in texas, unlike any other phenomenon known to humanity, it would be a bit smaller, because texas has a 25% capacity factor; the reason the usa has an overall lower solar capacity factor of 21% is that some solar farms are in suboptimal places like maine (10%) so the power doesn't require long-distance transmission so right now it's really tough for nuclear to compete with solar on earth reply Gibbon1 11 hours agorootparentprevThe bulk of humanity lives between 45 north latitude and 15 south latitude. http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2021/11/world-population-by-lat... reply grecy 7 hours agorootparentprev> You do realize solar isn't viable in norther parts I lived in the Yukon for 4 years, would drive many hours due south to get to the capital of Alaska. I met dozens of people that had off-grid houses powered entirely by solar. Remember the sun is up for 20+ hours a day in summer. In winter they had to be careful, but the had full houses with washing machines, fridges, etc. etc. This was in 2015 when people had lead acid batteries and only a few kW of panels. I bet it's much more common now. reply Turing_Machine 15 hours agoparentprev>now that solar energy is far cheaper than coal ever was I'm sorry, this is simply not true. Usually such claims are the result of ignoring two basic facts: First, solar is only online 50% of the time, at most (in most regions, considerably less than 50%). That means that you need at a minimum twice the nameplate capacity for a solar plant than for a coal one. Second, being offline half the time means that you also need sufficient (very expensive!) storage capacity to cover the half the time that the solar plant is not working at all. In other words, to replace a 2GW conventional plant you're going to need at least 4GW worth of solar cells, plus 24 megawatt-hours of storage. If you have a source for reliable figures that take these factors into account, and still show solar being \"far cheaper\", please provide it. Edit: oh, and no woo-woo battery or solar cell technology that's not currently in mass production. Your statement was that it's \"far cheaper\" right now, not using future fantasy batteries or solar cells that may (or may not) be on the market in the future. reply klipklop 15 hours agorootparentYou nailed it. What do you do when you have cloud cover for two weeks in a row? It’s not unheard of when some areas have 200+ days of at least some cloud coverage. Nuclear is essential to avoid using coal and not having regional rolling blackouts due to weather. Solar alone is not realistic anytime soon in all regions of the US. reply bryanlarsen 15 hours agorootparentNuclear is a horrible complement to cheap intermittent renewables. Running it as a peaker multiples your costs and running it as base loads means selling power for negative prices when the sun is shining. Solar/wind plus batteries for short term storage and pumped hydro for long term storage is the cheapest way to get zero carbon energy. Pumped hydro is more expensive than fossil peakera so build out of that hasn't happened yet. reply wait_a_minute 14 hours agorootparentHow do you scale up to producing far more energy in that approach? What about the efficiency to produce large amounts of energy on large spacecraft and other planets and in the ocean? reply kragen 10 hours agorootparentare you asking how you scale up to producing far more energy with solar panels? world marketed energy consumption is about 18 terawatts, total terrestrial insolation is about 128000 terawatts, and current mainstream panels are about 23% efficient, so if you put solar panels on 50% of the earth's surface, you get 15000 terawatts, which is almost 1000 times more than the humans are using now. on the bottom of the ocean you probably need a different approach, maybe nuclear, or egs geothermal, or maybe running a cable up to the surface, or periodically receiving shipments of thermite in a submarine. some other planets will have no trouble with solar panels; others will need nuclear reactors reply wait_a_minute 3 hours agorootparentGetting only 1,000 times more than humans are using now but requiring 50% of the earth's surface seems like an awful deal. Not only do you need much more of the earth's surface, taking away from trees and habitats and other uses, but you need to significantly increase mining activities to produce the panels and their associated infrastructure. Whereas to get 15,000 additional terawawtts from more nuclear reactors, you could do that with 1,200 - 1,900 additional nuclear reactors occupying just the size of Rhode Island. reply bryanlarsen 3 hours agorootparentBut we wouldn't need 50%, we'd need .05% reply wait_a_minute 2 hours agorootparentThat depends on how much more efficient solar panels get and what future energy requirements are, but in any case it'll be worse to scale energy creation with solar than with nuclear. reply kragen 14 hours agorootparentprevdo you have a source on the pumped hydro costs? i thought it was cheaper, just impossible most places reply bryanlarsen 7 hours agorootparentCosts are high because gas peakers exist and pumped storage generally doesn't.

What do you do when you have cloud cover for two weeks in a row? Never mind the volcanic winter that seems to happen every few thousand years. reply kragen 11 hours agorootparentprevno place has as high a capacity factor for solar pv as 50%; the world average is 14% (i.e., 14 watts average output per 100 watts nameplate output) and the country with the highest is egypt at 35% (this doesn't mean that you get zero power for 65% or 86% of the day. it means that you get lower than max power at all times except noon. to a great extent you can compensate by that by just installing more panels, but at night you need a better strategy) but the capacity factor is irrelevant to the fact that solar energy on the power grid generally sells for about half the price that coal-generated electricity sells for, on the same grid, when storage capacity is insufficient. in fact, prices used to go negative at night (to avoid shutting down slow-ramping baseload plants) and now they go negative in the day https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/05/28/record-low-solar-ppas... is an article from four years ago giving some specific prices: a solar ppa had just been signed for 15 dollars per megawatt hour, while the cost of production with coal at the san juan generating station was 44.90 dollars per megawatt hour, even though it was built right on top of a coal mine to save on shipping costs. that's why the san juan generating station has been decommissioned. if you look, you'll find stories like this all over the place, and solar panels now cost half of what they did when that story was written now, it's true that a ppa that includes battery storage will be more expensive than the 1.5¢ per kilowatt-hour ppa in that article. (https://emp.lbl.gov/pv-ppa-prices has a queryable database of all the ppas signed in the usa, although the usa is less reliable as an indicator of true costs because of how its prices are artificially inflated by protectionist tariffs.) how much more expensive depends on how much utility-scale storage is needed; you suggest 12 hours, but a much more typical number in practice is 3–4 hours, partly because there are still coal plants and partly because electrical demand drops a lot at night also, you are incorrectly assuming that 'conventional' plants have a capacity factor of 100%, when a more typical capacity factor for a coal plant is 60% so let's consider a kind of worst case: replacing your suggested 2 gigawatts (nameplate) of coal plants in the usa, where construction costs are ridiculously inflated. before we swung the wrecking ball, those coal plants were generating 1.2 gigawatts (real) of power (10.5 billion kilowatt hours per year), so we need 1.2 gigawatts (real) of solar panels. in the usa the average capacity factor is 21% (the article i linked above is from an area with more sun than average) so that's 5.7 gigawatts peak. typical costs for utility-scale fixed-tilt solar plants in q1 02024 were 98¢ per peak watt https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight... including costs like permitting, design and engineering, etc. so that's 5.6 billion dollars. utility bond yields in the usa are currently at 4.35%, and often these things are amortized over 25 years. i think the amortization calculation is that you have to pay 372 million dollars a year, which works out to 3.5¢ per kilowatt hour or 35 dollars per megawatt hour. definitely too cheap for coal to compete with, but still a lot more expensive than the price that ppa came in at so, suppose we need 4 hours of storage for our 1.2 gigawatts. that's 4800 megawatt hours. six months ago lithium-ion batteries have fallen precipitously to 139 dollars per kilowatt hour https://about.bnef.com/blog/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-... so we need to spend another 670 million dollars on the batteries, which adds about 12% to the cost of the project. except that in real life you need more than just a pile of batteries, you need to pour concrete and run wires and connect inverters and so on. and the batteries won't last 25 years, maybe 8, so you have to amortize this capex over a much shorter period. but it should be clear that this is not a crushing cost that dwarfs the cost of the solar farm (theoretically lead-acid might be cheaper by a factor of 1.5 or 2 or so, but lithium-ion's advantages seem to have driven it out of the utility-scale market) aha, here we go. https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2023/utility-scale_battery_... says that a 4-hour 60-megawatt lithium-ion battery system costs 446 dollars per kilowatt hour and has 240 megawatt hours of storage. so our required 4800 megawatt hours cost 2 billion dollars. that's about three times the cost estimate above for just the batteries, but that's an estimate from before the batteries dropped in cost by half, so 1.3 billion dollars is a better estimate. this plus the 5.6 billion dollars for the solar plant gives us a total up-front cost of 6.9 billion dollars since it's getting late, i'll just link you to this four-year-old profile of a ppa for 20 dollars a megawatt hour for generation plus 20 dollars a megawatt hour for storage https://www.energy-storage.news/battery-storage-at-us20-mwh-... and this lawrence radiation lab brief https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/utility... the main reason for the difference seems to be how sunny the location is; the technical brief explains: > Aided by the ITC, most recent PPAs in our sample are priced around $20/MWh (on a levelized basis, expressed in real 2021 dollars, and including bundled energy, capacity, and RECs) for plants located in the West, and $30-$40/MWh for plants elsewhere in the continental United States. the itc is a subsidy, so the real cost is a bit higher (due to the tariffs) reply Turing_Machine 3 hours agorootparent> when a more typical capacity factor for a coal plant is 60% This is, of course, patent nonsense. \"Not producing maximum power because it isn't needed at the moment\" is an entirely different thing from \"not producing maximum power because you can't\". A coal or nuclear plant that's producing less than its maximum output because the power isn't needed at the moment can be ramped up if needed (not super quickly, hence the need for peaker plants, but it can be done). A solar plant that's producing less than its maximum output because it's night, or because it's cloudy, cannot. > https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/05/28/record-low-solar-ppas... is an article from four years ago giving some specific prices: a solar ppa had just been signed for 15 dollars per megawatt hour, while the cost of production with coal at the san juan generating station 1) No storage costs are mentioned. 2) Most places are not New Mexico. 3) I'd bet money that there's some heavy government subsidization involved here. Ah, yes: \"EPE will also receive the associated renewable energy credits (“RECs”) bundled with the purchased energy.\" > you suggest 12 hours, but a much more typical number in practice is 3–4 hours, partly because there are still coal plants and partly because electrical demand drops a lot at night Wait: you're claiming that the nighttime zero production from solar plants doesn't matter because there are still coal plants? I'm sorry, that is a benefit of the coal plants, not the solar plants. What happens in your scenario when there aren't any more coal or nuclear plants? Again, that might work in New Mexico, but in most regions people would prefer not to freeze in the dark. reply EasyMark 15 hours agoparentprevI’ll never get behind solar as anything but supplemental or “roof top solar” until we have grid scale batteries that can power more than a few hours.

They certainly are, but not to the same degree. reply brigadier132 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's much more obvious than education. For education, what they are educated in matters. For healthcare, it's much harder to fundamentally lower the cost. Ie for energy, we know if we build a ton of nuclear reactors, wind turbines, and solar we could have practically free energy. It's just about increasing supply. Health care does not have that easy lever. For transport and housing, I agree it's analogous. If we lower the cost of housing and transportation dramatically then everything will also get cheaper. reply insane_dreamer 15 hours agorootparent> For healthcare, it's much harder to fundamentally lower the cost.

Compared to the rest of the OECD we have much higher costs (3x OECD average!) and worse health outcomes (life expectancy 4 yrs Non-proliferation groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists have warned against measures that ease licensing for high-tech nuclear reactors, including those using highly enriched uranium, arguing that safety should remain the priority.

I'm somewhat more sceptical of human nature, and the greed factor, when it comes to the proper disposal of nuclear waste. I get there are regs for that too - but our track-record for following regulations when it comes to waste disposal generally has not filled me with confidence. Costs incurred after the profit has been earned, (aka \"cleaning up\") are too easily avoided with a simple bankruptcy- and too easily corners are cut to just \"make it go away\". IMO cleaning-up costs should be paid for first, not last.

Modular reactors make no sense because larger reactors are more efficient. Nuclera plants ultimately just boil water and turn a turbine to generate power, just like any coal palnt. Coal plants burn coal to generate heat. A nuclear plant simply has a nuclear pile that generates heat. The failure modes are prohibitive. Just one incident (Fukushima) has a likely clean up cost of roughly $1 trillion [1] and will take decades, if not more than a century. Nearly 40 years later the absolutely exclusion zone for Chernobyl is still 1000 square miles. Chernobyl is hand waved away as \"poor Soviet construction and management\". Fukushima is hand waved away too. Massive failures are hand waved away by talking in terms of deaths. And, of course, fusion is a pipe dream.

Nuclear produces less than 2% of our energy. This is roughly linear: 130 years at 2%, therefore 65 years at 4% (and no one will nowadays invest in a reactor with no hope to exploit it for at the very least 60 years) Exploiting uranium ore of a lesser grade is possible but quickly gets more expensive and adds to nuclear greenhouse-gas emissions ( see the study \"Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Electricity Generation\" in \"Journal of Industrial Ecology\" (2012, Warner, Heath)): up to 110g eqCO2/KWh . reply insane_dreamer 5 hours agorootparentThose are _identified_ reserves.

to use this site European Southern Observatory Pressemitteilung Astronomen sehen das Erwachen eines massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in Echtzeit 18. Juni 2024 Ende 2019 begann die zuvor unauffällige Galaxie SDSS1335+0728 plötzlich heller zu leuchten als je zuvor. Um den Ursachen auf den Grund zu gehen, haben Astronomen Daten von mehreren Weltraum- und Bodenobservatorien, darunter das Very Large Telescope (VLT) der Europäischen Südsternwarte (ESO), verwendet, um die Helligkeitsschwankungen der Galaxie nachzuverfolgen. In einer heute veröffentlichten Studie kommen sie zu dem Schluss, dass sie bisher noch nie beobachtete Veränderungen in einer Galaxie sehen – wahrscheinlich das Ergebnis des plötzlichen Erwachens des massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in ihrem Zentrum. „Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie beobachten eine weit entfernte Galaxie seit Jahren, und sie schien immer ruhig und inaktiv zu sein“, sagt Paula Sánchez Sáez, eine Astronomin der ESO in Deutschland und Hauptautorin der Studie, die zur Veröffentlichung in Astronomy & Astrophysics angenommen wurde. „Plötzlich zeigt ihr [Kern] dramatische Veränderungen in der Helligkeit, die sich von allen typischen Ereignissen, die wir bisher gesehen haben, unterscheiden.“ Genau das ist mit SDSS1335+0728 passiert, das nun als „aktiver galaktischer Kern“ (AGN) eingestuft wird – eine helle, kompakte Region, die von einem massereichen Schwarzen Loch angetrieben wird – nachdem es sich im Dezember 2019 dramatisch aufgehellt hatte [1]. Einige Phänomene, wie Supernova-Explosionen oder das durch Gezeitenkräfte verursachte Auseinanderbrechen von Sternen, bei denen ein Stern einem Schwarzen Loch zu nahe kommt und auseinandergerissen wird, können dazu führen, dass Galaxien plötzlich heller leuchten. Diese Helligkeitsschwankungen dauern jedoch in der Regel nur einige Dutzend oder höchstens einige Hundert Tage an. SDSS1335+0728 wird auch heute noch heller, mehr als vier Jahre, nachdem zum ersten Mal beobachtet wurde, dass sie „aufleuchtet“. Weiterhin sind die in der Galaxie, die sich 300 Millionen Lichtjahre entfernt im Sternbild Jungfrau befindet, festgestellten Schwankungen anders als alle bisher beobachteten und weisen die Astronomen auf eine andere Erklärung hin. Das Team versuchte, diese Helligkeitsschwankungen mithilfe einer Kombination aus Archivdaten und neuen Beobachtungen von mehreren Standorten, darunter dem X-Shooter-Instrument am VLT der ESO in der chilenischen Atacama-Wüste, zu verstehen [2]. Beim Vergleich der vor und nach Dezember 2019 aufgenommenen Daten stellten sie fest, dass SDSS1335+0728 jetzt viel mehr Licht im ultravioletten, optischen und infraroten Wellenlängenbereich abstrahlt. Die Galaxie begann im Februar 2024 auch mit der Aussendung von Röntgenstrahlen. „Dieses Verhalten ist beispiellos“, sagt Sánchez Sáez, die auch mit dem Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS) in Chile verbunden ist. „Die naheliegendste Erklärung für dieses Phänomen ist, dass wir beobachten, wie der [Kern] der Galaxie anfängt, (...) Aktivität zu zeigen“, sagt die Co-Autorin Lorena Hernández García vom MAS und der Universität Valparaíso in Chile. „Wenn das stimmt, wäre dies das erste Mal, dass wir die Aktivierung eines massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in Echtzeit beobachten.“ Massereiche Schwarze Löcher – mit Massen, die über hunderttausend Mal größer sind als die unserer Sonne – existieren im Zentrum der meisten Galaxien, einschließlich der Milchstraße. „Diese Giganten schlafen normalerweise und sind nicht direkt sichtbar“, erklärt der Co-Autor Claudio Ricci von der Diego-Portales-Universität, ebenfalls in Chile. „Im Fall von SDSS1335+0728 konnten wir das Erwachen des massereichen Schwarzen Lochs beobachten, das sich plötzlich das in seiner Umgebung vorhandene Gas einverleibte und sehr hell wurde.“ „Dieser Prozess (...) wurde noch nie zuvor beobachtet“, sagt Hernández García. In früheren Studien wurde zwar berichtet, dass inaktive Galaxien nach mehreren Jahren aktiv werden, doch dies ist das erste Mal, dass der Prozess selbst – das Erwachen des Schwarzen Lochs – in Echtzeit beobachtet wurde. Ricci, der auch mit dem Kavli-Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik an der Peking-Universität in China verbunden ist, fügt hinzu: „Das könnte auch bei unserem eigenen Sgr A*, dem massereichen Schwarzen Loch (...) im Zentrum unserer Galaxie, passieren“, aber es ist unklar, wie wahrscheinlich dies ist. Es sind noch weitere Beobachtungen erforderlich, um alternative Erklärungen auszuschließen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, dass wir ein ungewöhnlich langsames Ereignis der Gezeitenstörung oder sogar ein neues Phänomen beobachten. Wenn es sich tatsächlich um ein Ereignis der Gezeitenstörung handelt, wäre dies das längste und schwächste Ereignis dieser Art, das jemals beobachtet wurde. „Unabhängig von der Art der Schwankungen liefert [diese Galaxie] wertvolle Informationen darüber, wie Schwarze Löcher wachsen und sich entwickeln“, sagt Sánchez Sáez. „Wir gehen davon aus, dass Instrumente wie [MUSE am VLT oder die Instrumente am zukünftigen Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)] entscheidend zum Verständnis beitragen werden [warum die Galaxie heller wird].“ Endnoten [1] Die ungewöhnlichen Helligkeitsschwankungen der Galaxie SDSS1335+0728 wurden vom Zwicky-Transient-Facility-Teleskop (ZTF) in den USA entdeckt. Anschließend stufte der von Chile aus geleitete Algorithmus Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) SDSS1335+0728 als aktiven Galaxienkern ein. [2] Das Team sammelte Archivdaten von den NASA-Satelliten Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) und Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), dem Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), dem Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) und dem eROSITA-Instrument auf dem Spektr-RG-Weltraumobservatorium von IKI und DLR. Neben dem VLT der ESO wurden die Nachbeobachtungen mit dem Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR), dem W. M. Keck Observatory und dem Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory und dem Chandra X-ray Observatory der NASA durchgeführt. Weitere Informationen Diese Studie wurde in einem Artikel mit dem Titel „SDSS1335+0728: The awakening of a ∼ 106 M⊙ black hole” veröffentlicht, der in der Zeitschrift Astronomy & Astrophysics (https://aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347957) erschienen ist.

Die Europäische Südsternwarte (ESO) befähigt Wissenschaftler*innen weltweit, die Geheimnisse des Universums zum Nutzen aller zu entdecken. Wir entwerfen, bauen und betreiben Observatorien von Weltrang, die Astronominnen und Astronomen nutzen, um spannende Fragen zu beantworten und die Faszination der Astronomie zu wecken, und wir fördern die internationale Zusammenarbeit in der Astronomie. Die ESO wurde 1962 als zwischenstaatliche Organisation gegründet und wird heute von 16 Mitgliedstaaten (Belgien, Dänemark, Deutschland, Frankreich, Finnland, Irland, Italien, den Niederlanden, Österreich, Polen, Portugal, Schweden, der Schweiz, Spanien, der Tschechischen Republik und dem Vereinigten Königreich) sowie dem Gastland Chile und Australien als strategischem Partner unterstützt. Der Hauptsitz der ESO und ihr Besucherzentrum und Planetarium, die ESO Supernova, befinden sich in der Nähe von München in Deutschland, während die chilenische Atacama-Wüste, ein wunderbarer Ort mit einzigartigen Bedingungen für die Himmelsbeobachtung, unsere Teleskope beherbergt. Die ESO betreibt drei Beobachtungsstandorte: La Silla, Paranal und Chajnantor. Am Standort Paranal betreibt die ESO das Very Large Telescope und das dazugehörige Very Large Telescope Interferometer sowie Durchmusterungsteleskope wie z. B. VISTA. Ebenfalls am Paranal wird die ESO das Cherenkov Telescope Array South betreiben, das größte und empfindlichste Gammastrahlen-Observatorium der Welt. Zusammen mit internationalen Partnern betreibt die ESO auf Chajnantor APEX und ALMA, zwei Einrichtungen zur Beobachtung des Himmels im Millimeter- und Submillimeterbereich. Auf dem Cerro Armazones in der Nähe von Paranal bauen wir „das größte Auge der Welt am Himmel“ – das Extremely Large Telescope der ESO. Von unseren Büros in Santiago, Chile, aus unterstützen wir unsere Aktivitäten im Land und arbeiten mit chilenischen Partnern und der Gesellschaft zusammen.

To understand why, astronomers have used data from several space and ground-based observatories, including the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (ESO’s VLT), to track how the galaxy’s brightness has varied. In a study out today, they conclude that they are witnessing changes never seen before in a galaxy — likely the result of the sudden awakening of the massive black hole at its core.\" \"Follow-up observations are still needed to rule out alternative explanations. Another possibility is that we are seeing an unusually slow tidal disruption event, or even a new phenomenon\" reply prewett 3 hours agoparent> It means not the creation of a black hole (like I initially thought), There was a candidate for a stellar collapse to a black hole a few years ago: https://www.livescience.com/disappearing-star-black-hole-no-... Unfortunately it's in a galaxy far, far away, so we couldn't see the star directly, we just saw a characteristic emission line disappear without a corresponding supernova. Given that it seemed like a large star, one possibility is direct core-collapse. reply logtempo 3 hours agoparentprevI guess \"black hole awaken\" is a more attractive headline than \"black hole fart\" ! It's really cool to see that we have so much instruments, we can actually monitor (a very small part) of the universe activity. reply q1w2 3 hours agorootparentA more correct title is \"Galaxy brightens and scientists suspect it might be due to the galaxy's black hole\" There is no direct evidence the black hole is doing anything - it's just the only theory we have. reply newobj 7 minutes agoprevWhat are the odds of being alive and having the technology in place to witness any galactic event, on the galactic timescale?

Can previously trapped matter somehow escape? reply ajuc 55 minutes agorootparentThe only way anything \"escapes\" from black holes is Hawking Radiation - virtual pairs of particles that appear and disappear constantly - can be split when they happen on event horizon - and that slowly drains the energy from black hole. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation If 2 black holes collide - they join together. reply Waterluvian 7 hours agoprevIs there a convenient listing of the timeframe of cosmic events? I have a poor sense of when we’re talking hours, years, decades, millennia, MA, GA. Might make for a really cool static website project. Same with geologic events, too! reply foota 3 hours agoparentFun fact, supernovae take only seconds to undergo extremely violent processes that typically result in their explosion. E.g., \"Within a few seconds of the collapse process, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1–2×10^44 J) to unbind the star in a supernova.\" reply jvanderbot 3 hours agorootparentI've always wondered how realistic the timing was for the supernova explosion at the end of The Fountain. Seems they didn't do so bad! reply Fezzik 2 hours agorootparentExtending the tangent: The Fountain is a criminally underrated movie! reply rodolphoarruda 6 hours agoparentprevThe most relevant event to us here is the arrival of Trisolarans in about 400 years. reply djtriptych 6 hours agoparentprevwhich event are you referring to? reply nashashmi 5 hours agoparentprevto go from a supernova to a black hole, it takes a couple of days. For a galaxy to be rearranged by a black hole, it take a couple of millennia. (my information is not precise nor the latest, so it could have been revised recently.) reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparent> (my information is not precise you're in good company. most cosmological \"dates\" are not precise. for example, the age of the universe is suspected to be about 13.7 billion years +/- 20 million years. That's a really big +/- in years, but just 0.2% tolerance. the size of milky way is estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs. again, that's a lot of miles/kilometers of a range. it's not like they can run out and \"pull tape\" to take that measurement. it's one of my favorite quirks of astronomy. of course even the tolerances/variances are going to be astronomically large. reply lukan 4 hours agorootparentI apologize in advance, but I still point to the relevant comic: https://xkcd.com/2205/ reply mr_mitm 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't get it. Isn't precision always relative? Who cares how large the numbers sound in certain units? reply oh2aa 2 hours agorootparentNo, precision or error can measured in absolute or relative terms. In either case, the unit is irrelevant, you could say +/- \"0.000001 big bang timespan.\" The point is that in the realm of human experience, that tracking error is quite big. reply AnimalMuppet 4 hours agorootparentprevCould you define what you mean by a galaxy being \"rearranged\" by a black hole? reply nashashmi 3 hours agorootparentThe theory behind spiral galaxies is that a black hole of considerable magnitude and time lies right in the center. Gravitational waves spirals out for millennia. They start moving towards the center but also move towards each other. Closest stars move towards the center and other stars begin following the close stars and so on. This should ordinarily end up like an octopus with multiple arms extending from the center outwards. But then the Universe must also be rotating like a disc. And so the galaxy spirals out with curved arms instead. reply AnimalMuppet 2 hours agorootparentSo, yes, we think there is a massive black hole at the center of all (or just spiral?) galaxies. And gravitational waves move at the speed of light, so if something changes the mass of the central black hole, and the galaxy has a radius of 25,000 light years, it will take 25,000 years for that wave to propagate out to the rim of the galaxy, rearranging things along the way. But: 1. The massive, central black hole did not come from a supernova. There are no stars anything like that big. 2. Even if there were a huge central mass and it collapsed, that doesn't actually change the mass distribution as far as the rest of the galaxy is concerned. There is very little change to propagate. The existence of the huge central mass would have already \"arranged\" the galaxy. 3. Galaxies spiral with curved arms due to their own rotation, not due to the universe's rotation. If the universe were rotating like a disk (and that was causing the spiral of galaxies), then you would expect the spin of galaxies to all be aligned. And they aren't; not at all. reply api 6 hours agoprevWhat if we are quietly watching from a distance (in both space and time) as thousands of civilizations are helplessly irradiated to death by gamma rays? reply greggsy 6 hours agoparentIt’s around 300 million light years away, so this technically occurred a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. With that in mind, I can imagine that millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. reply BubbleRings 4 hours agorootparent> …now radiating much more light at ultraviolet… I noticed that tooIs this too far away to try to detect the gravitational waves, if it made some? I forget, do gravitational waves travel at C? reply danparsonson 2 hours agorootparenthttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_o... Seems well within range; and yes they travel at C - there have been some LIGO observations that were successfully correlated with more traditional (e.g. optical or radio) observations. reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparentprevSo what you're suggesting is that this might be a blast from the Death Star and we just saw Alderaan get wiped out? reply slowmovintarget 2 hours agorootparentNo. The scale is galactic, not planetary. reply HarHarVeryFunny 5 hours agoparentprevWell, some alien species a few hundred million light years away, with a big telescope, could be currently watching the Chicxulub meteor hit earth, and all the dinosaurs subsequently starving to death. reply BurningFrog 5 hours agorootparent65 million light years away, unless there is a system of giant mirrors out there. It is a nice thought though. That was a real rough day for Earth, but we turned out alright in the end. reply steve_adams_86 4 hours agorootparentIt just occurred to me that if dinosaurs never existed here and we found them somewhere else, they’d be such an incredible discovery. We’re lucky to have such an awesome history of life on this planet. reply lukan 4 hours agorootparent\"We’re lucky to have such an awesome history of life on this planet.\" We are probably lucky, to have life at all. reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentHumans are probably unique. Intelligent life probably not and life at all is likely commonplace. It would be quite a miracle if given the size and scale of the universe Earth is the only place where life arose and also managed to evolve multiple intelligent species also emerged (cephalopods, dolphins, elephants, and primates at least) reply wruza 3 hours agorootparentIt depends. If simple life is common, how rare is GOE or a similar event? If GOE is not that rare, it feels like intelligent life is just a matter of time, ice ages and enough branches to grab on. Otoh if we are the result of a long domino chain, the universe life is screwed. reply withinboredom 3 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of \"Carl's Doomsday Scenario\" where they pick up a pet that happens to be an \"a species seeded on all life-supporting planets, but a nasty asteroid caused them to go extinct here. I believe they are called 'Velociraptors' here.\" reply mensetmanusman 3 hours agorootparentprevThey were actually boiled alive due to reentry of earth rocks back to earth heating the atmosphere. reply mensetmanusman 3 hours agoparentprevThe death of one individual is a tragedy, the death of a billion civilizations is an HN comment. reply lukan 6 hours agoparentprevOr enlightened and transformed to a higher dimension? The answer is probably the same. We would not know and continue our daily chores. reply nikbackm 6 hours agoparentprevIt's not likely that life will survive long enough to form civilizations that close to a black hole. It has probably fed like this many times before already. reply denton-scratch 3 hours agorootparent> that close to a black hole How close to a black hole? This isn't a common-or-garden black hole, it's supermassive. If it's (300M years ago) suddenly started producing intense radiation that we can measure here, then I assume that anyone in the galaxy that can see the central region is receiving a lot of radiation, as well as a storm of high-energy particles. reply robofanatic 6 hours agoparentprevWhat we are watching right now has happened millions of years in the past. reply nashashmi 5 hours agoprevshower thoughts: Galaxies of stars are like people traveling through the cosmos together in one group. Elliptical galaxies have a direction of travel, that is why they are elliptical. A galaxy gets it first massive supernova, and a black hole is formed, and it becomes a spiral galaxy, kind of like when a seismic social event happens and everyone gets in line. reply danparsonson 2 hours agoparentYou might enjoy this if you haven't already seen it: https://youtu.be/71eUes30gwc - TL;DW black hole density decreases with increasing radius, and the average density of the observable Universe is potentially greater than that of an equivalent-sized black hole, so maybe the whole Universe is inside one... reply spacecadet 3 hours agoparentprevshower thoughts: - bubbles in water act like black holes - the universe itself may only be a bubble among many - the multiverse looks like foam reply NVHacker 6 hours agoprevAnyone else finds the \"real time\" attribute hilarious in the context of these cosmic events ? reply onetimeuse92304 4 hours agoparentIt is not hilarious, it is actually the correct use of the term. Otherwise, you would have to contend with the fact that \"real time\" does not exist at all, as information about any event has to necessarily take time to travel to reach you. So no \"real time\" coverage of anything -- the information always takes time to travel the distance. What is not a correct understanding of how time works is claiming that it happened some thousands of years ago. No, from our reference frame it happened now. It is meaningless to say that it happened thousands of years ago because it happened thousands of years ago in some other, arbitrary reference frame. reply yoav 4 hours agorootparentYou’re using reference frames incorrectly. It didn’t happen in real time, but they did observe in it real time. One is a measurement of the event and one is a measurement of when the photons reached us. reply anyonecancode 4 hours agorootparentThis is why any faster-than-light travel must either be impossible or mean that that traveling backwards in time is possible. I point my telescope at a planet four light years away (I have super advanced telescope that can see these details), and use a worm-hole or other plot device to teleport instantly to that spot. Where do I arrive -- at what I observed, or at some point in empty space because I've just arrived at where that planet was four years ago? If the former, I must somehow have traveled back in time by four years to arrive at the spot I had observed. If the latter, I suppose we could instead say our destination is where we calculate the planet will be four years from now. Except that my travel time was instantaneous, so again either I've arrived too early and need to wait around for four years, or I jumped 4 years into the future (at which point that's not really FTL travel, just kind of stepping outside of time into some nether state for four years). reply baq 4 hours agorootparentprevwe saw it happening in real time from here. does it even matter here that elsewhere sees it at a different time? reply insane_dreamer 4 hours agoparentprev\"as it unfolded\" would be more accurate than \"real time\" Technically, one can argue that \"real time\" is relative to the time frame in which we observe something, but that's not how we generally use \"real time\", but rather we use it to define an event that is observed at the same moment (or very close to) the moment in which it occurs, such as a match broadcast live on TV (though there is some delay). reply wruza 3 hours agoparentprevWe say that it happened in the past, using our wall clock ideas. But you can't rush there and look back to \"see dinosaurs\", so it's at least as correct to say that it happens in real time. This is an event, registering now in our reference frame. Nothing else provided. reply BearOso 5 hours agoparentprevAt the center of the black hole, time has relatively stopped with respect to us. So, yes. reply tekla 6 hours agoparentprevNo because light-speed is the speed of causality. It is by all definitions, real time reply EncomLab 5 hours agorootparentYou are conflating reference frames - it determines causality in your local reference frame but not in any other reference frame. The concept of \"real time\" - like all time - is entirely relative to the reference frame you are using. reply wruza 2 hours agorootparentCorrect, there's no global timeline, so it's not clear what \"just\" 300M years ago even means. Some RFs seen it already, and some will never see it. But in ours it happened in Jun 2024. It's 300M light years away, not ago. reply mulhoon 5 hours agorootparentprevYou’ve just blown my mind. reply yesbabyyes 5 hours agorootparentAnother mind-blowing perspective is from that of a single photon; since time slows when approaching c, from its perspective it's eternal, and, since distance shrinks when approaching c, from its perspective it's also omnipresent. reply d1sxeyes 4 hours agorootparentWell, it's not exactly eternal, it's that time is not passing for that photon. It's also (as far as I can tell) only correct to say that distances shrink as speed increases when you're talking about massive objects. A photon would not experience space contraction in any meaningful way. reply bamboozled 4 hours agoparentprevYeah, it's old news. reply revskill 7 hours agoprevI should know this 4 years ago reply ycombinatorics 3 hours agoprevold news, happened already 300million years ago reply gigatexal 3 hours agoprev [–] Ahh so we saw the Simulators turn on a black hole in their Universe Simulator of which we are NPCs. ;-) In all actuality this is really really cool. reply ck2 3 hours agoparent [–] https://crowdmade.com/cdn/shop/files/Dev_Are_Watching_Shirt_...
