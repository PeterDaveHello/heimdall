    "originBody": "Skip to main content RESEARCH NEWS ABOUT Back to News BLASTPASS NSO Group iPhone Zero-Click, Zero-Day Exploit Captured in the Wild September 7, 2023 Apple has just issued an update for Apple products including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and Apple Watches. We encourage all users to immediately update their devices. We urge all at-risk users to consider enabling Lockdown Mode as we believe it blocks this attack. Last week, while checking the device of an individual employed by a Washington DC-based civil society organization with international offices, Citizen Lab found an actively exploited zero-click vulnerability being used to deliver NSO Group’s Pegasus mercenary spyware. The BLASTPASS Exploit Chain We refer to the exploit chain as BLASTPASS. The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim. The exploit involved PassKit attachments containing malicious images sent from an attacker iMessage account to the victim. We expect to publish a more detailed discussion of the exploit chain in the future. Disclosure to Apple & CVEs Citizen Lab immediately disclosed our findings to Apple and assisted in their investigation. Apple issued two CVEs related to this exploit chain (CVE-2023-41064 and CVE-2023-41061) Update Apple Devices Now We urge everyone to immediately update their devices. We encourage everyone who may face increased risk because of who they are or what they do to enable Lockdown Mode. We believe, and Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team has confirmed to us, that Lockdown Mode blocks this particular attack. We commend Apple for their rapid investigative response and patch cycle, and we acknowledge the victim and their organization for their collaboration and assistance. Heavily-Targeted Civil Society: A Cybersecurity Early Warning System This latest find shows once again that civil society is targeted by highly sophisticated exploits and mercenary spyware. Apple’s update will secure devices belonging to regular users, companies, and governments around the globe. The BLASTPASS discovery highlights the incredible value to our collective cybersecurity of supporting civil society organizations. Note: Post updated 5:42PM Eastern Time Sept 7th to reflect that Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team and Citizen Lab believe that Lockdown Mode blocks this particular attack.

They&#x27;re not ashamed of it either, or else they wouldn&#x27;t put it on their CV:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;nso-group&#x2F;people&#x2F;That right there tells me that we as \"the tech community\" are way too okay with this sort of application of the tech. The tech we&#x27;re all so convinced will \"make the world a better place.\" &#x2F;s reply caisah 2 hours agoparentThere is a nice PBS documentary about Pegasus&#x27;s NSO https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;frontline&#x2F;documentary&#x2F;global-spywar....It looks like NSO is backed up by the Israeli government. They say their software is only sold to governments which were previously vetted, but the reality is that most of the time they sell to authoritarian states which monitor and persecute people opposing the regime. reply goodluckchuck 1 hour agorootparentThe ties to government are a red herring. Hacking into people’s private phones and computer systems is generally immoral and illegal.It generally continues to be immoral and illegal when governments do it. Except it also becomes more outrageous, because governments are supposed to protect us from this sort of thing. reply franga2000 38 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t see why the government doing it would make it more outrageous. If democratically elected leaders pass a law outlining when and how the cops should be able to access private devices, a judge looks over a specific case and signs a warrant, the cops use a hacking tool to catch a terrorist and the evidence is presented in court, this seems like the most excusable use of hacking tools that I can think of.The government is given power over people in order to protect us from other people and this is one tool to do it. They have cops with guns and soldiers with tanks, they can break in, search and seize, they can lock people in prison. All of these things are tools and it&#x27;s they way they&#x27;re used that decides what&#x27;s immoral or outrageous.The bigger problem here is that a private company has these tools and can use and sell then with no oversight. reply allie1 1 hour agorootparentprevTo sell the software, they need approval from Israel’s govt, as the software is treated as a weapon reply Sephr 2 hours agoparentprevSelling malware&#x2F;software weapons to US entities is generally legal for other US entities*, with the main caveat that if it ends up ITAR regulated then you can only sell it to the US government and other ITAR-cleared suppliers unless it&#x27;s open source (in which case you&#x27;d be selling the platform).NSO Group is bad because they have been caught selling to oppressive regimes and allegedly actively supported (and potentially continue to support) the deployment of their software for oppressive regimes to harm innocent civilians. They should be (and iirc are) sanctioned for their bad behaviors, bad intentions, and mishandling of their responsibilities.* There are plenty of caveats (e.g. the seller & buyer need to have good intentions and only plan to use the malware in accordance with the law). I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. reply resolutebat 2 hours agoparentprevOh, but you see, NSO targets only \"terrorists and criminals\", so if you&#x27;re a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide, there&#x27;s nothing to be concerned about. Right? It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s any regimes out there where, say, casual investigative journalism or opposition politics would ever land you with criminal or terrorist charges, no sirree. reply sz4kerto 1 hour agorootparentIn Hungary, for example, which is an EU country and democracy (i.e. there are elections), investigative journalists have been targeted with Pegasus by the government. reply megous 2 minutes agorootparentElections != democaracy. In Russia, there are also elections. So are they in Syria, and so on. reply baq 14 minutes agorootparentprevIn Poland, opposition party election campaign leaders were invigilated by Pegasus. reply H8crilA 2 hours agoparentprevMuch of this stuff is classified as a weapon, and thus really sold by the Israeli government, not by the company. It&#x27;s no different from a MANPADS that sometimes is used to destroy a Ka-52 over Ukraine, and sometimes is used to shoot down a civilian airliner - that is to say it&#x27;s directed by the foreign policy (and foreign policy errors) of the manufacturing country.There&#x27;s no reason to expect the world to disarm any time soon, so the best approach is to be aware and democratically influence policy, rooting out bad ideas and bad actors.Israel is constantly trying to woo Saudi Arabia so that they can be allies during a potential war with Iran. Israel will definitely sacrifice some human rights activists just for the ability to cross the Saudi airspace. But it has not been going well for Israel lately. reply black_puppydog 2 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s multiple responses echoing this idea that it&#x27;s a defense company like any other and thus an evil we&#x27;ll have to accept exists.That may be true, but these companies (NSO group is by no means worse than the rest of them, just more notorious) have been caught over and over again, selling these \"weapons\" to dictators, companies, etc, who in turn use them to spy on journalists and activists, not terrorists or anything of the sort. And that doesn&#x27;t even go into keeping 0-days for the benefit of the few, keeping literally everyone on the planet less safe, which is arguably as big an issue, if more systemic.These companies may exist in some form or another because the nation state & private surveillance systems that form their client base want them to exist.But my point is that the individuals working at this company should be ashamed of themselves. I&#x27;m not appealing to their sense of morals, I&#x27;m talking purely about \"us the tech community\" making it abundantly clear that having one of these companies on your CV will make it very hard to find any decent job afterwards. It needs to be socially expensive to work there. To loan from Max Goldt&#x27;s opinion on the BILD newspaper [1]:> NSO Group and the like are an organ of infamy. It is wrong to use their products. Someone who contributes to these products is absolutely socially unacceptable. It would be remiss to be friendly or even polite to any of their developers or managers. One must be as unkind to them as the law will just allow. They are bad people who do wrong.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;6758128-die-bild-zeitung-is... reply H8crilA 1 hour agorootparentThis is true, but then you have to also socially shame a large part of the US military, for invading Iraq. At least those that didn&#x27;t resign as soon as it became clear that there are no WMDs there, and the large amount of Iraqis were killed pretty much for nothing.In short - you have a point, but it&#x27;s not quite that simple. reply fphhotchips 30 minutes agorootparentprevSo then, by this logic, once you&#x27;ve worked for NSO Group or the like, there&#x27;s no way back for you. How then, can someone reform or \"see the light\"? Is someone once tainted, always tainted? Or do they have to do 10 years in the NFP space before we see them as worthy?The problem is that by walling off developers who participate in these activities, we essentially force them to continue these activities. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s net positive. reply azernik 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I think the appropriate comparison is if a weapons manufacturer made \"selling to dictatorships for suppressing dissidents\" the core of its business strategy. reply stefan_ 1 hour agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t just make a gun, sell it and then it&#x27;s up to whoever uses it. It is well established they run the C&C servers and tailor operations - they are combatants. reply throwaway290 2 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK Israeli government audits NSO and stuff, but they are separate... And Intellexa (authors of Predator I think?) doesn&#x27;t even get audited because it&#x27;s \"not israeli\" on paper reply rany_ 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more like they leverage it for diplomacy. The auditing means nothing really, it&#x27;s being given to authoritarian government like Saudi Arabia as long as they are OK with Israel existing. The bar to get access to NSO tools is too low... reply azernik 2 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t really leverage it for diplomacy. Israeli arms exports policy consistently prioritizes getting better R&D economies of scale over actually affecting foreign states&#x27; behavior. reply H8crilA 2 hours agorootparentprevThe important part is export control - i.e. deciding who can buy the stuff: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NSO_Group reply jwr 1 hour agoparentprev> That right there tells me that we as \"the tech community\" are way too okay with this sort of application of the tech. The tech we&#x27;re all so convinced will \"make the world a better place.\"This calls for a larger discussion of individual choices of every one of us. It would not be an easy discussion, because things are far from simple, and yet every one of us should actively think, instead of falling into the whataboutism trap and doing nothing.For example, there are probably thousands of tech people in Russia right now either breaking into Ukrainian systems or writing software for missiles, drones, targeting systems, etc. These systems do not write themselves. Each of those people should ask themselves if this is really what they should be doing. I am certainly asking myself if I want to ever work with people who were complicit in these crimes (and how will I know?).I know some people who pledged to never work on any military systems. I was close to that point of view, until Russia started dropping bombs on my Ukrainian friends. Now I don&#x27;t see it quite in the same light anymore.Similarly, the NSO group is not an amorphous entity, PEOPLE work there and write these exploits. In each case, it is a conscious decision.My point is that we can&#x27;t abstract tech from moral choices. There is always right and wrong, there is always the right thing to do. It might not be universally applicable, and there will always be endless discussions on HN (\"but what about...\"), but each of us can and should think about how our work is applied. reply neilv 2 hours agoparentprevIn the current environment of Internet-powered inane mob behavior, we should try to avoid pointing the mob at individuals. reply dspearson 15 minutes agorootparentNobody is forcing anyone to work for these scumbags. It is a choice. reply rakkhi 34 minutes agoparentprevWell it&#x27;s like complaining about the sun or wearing sun screen. Bad guys will always be there. Bears pandas eagles...We wear sun screen and maybe get pissed if the sun screen company is not doing a good job. But go ahead yell at the sun. Those dam UV rays!!! reply comboy 29 minutes agorootparentI generally agree but it&#x27;s nuanced. Think about your physical home security. reply dr_kiszonka 2 hours agoparentprevFWIW, some tech does make the world a better place. It is just that a lot of this tech does not pay enough to put it on our radars. reply smfugit 1 hour agoparentprevNo big political leaders out of the tech world yet. So \"the tech community\" doesnt have anyone to rally around. And this more a political prob than a technical problem. reply quonn 2 hours agoparentprev— The tech we&#x27;re all so convinced will \"make the world a better place.\" —That was true 15 years ago … I don‘t hear this often anymore. reply klabb3 2 hours agorootparentIt sad true that tech would make the world a better place (in some ways). But not because of the infinite goodness and wisdom of the first movers, who happened to entrench themselves at the right moment in time.The same is true today. Eg LLMs have huge potential. What worries me are the sociopaths who draw the same conclusion. reply aihkas 2 hours agoparentprevOf course they don&#x27;t care and they have no shame. It&#x27;s part of their Zionist ideology to be ruthless psychopathic racist murderers and land thieves. reply jker 5 minutes agorootparentTake it down a notch, please. reply Obscurity4340 10 hours agoprevIts super interesting to me how much its emphasized that you shouldn&#x27;t use Lockdown Mode unless you are a journalist or otherwise in direct palpable danger. They really do try to talk you out of it. Its curious, because there&#x27;s very little difference in functionality (as experienced by the user) other than disabling a lot of Apple nonsense from running in the background expanding your attack surface.And everybody parrots the nonsense caveat that everyone shouldn&#x27;t use it, only those special enough should like it was a zero-sum game or scarce resource. Everyone should use it because it disables a lot of nonsense that doesn&#x27;t serve you and probably even saves battery power. Also, the more people use it, the less it can be used to fingerprint specific users. reply andrewia 10 hours agoparentIt does make iOS slightly more inconvenient, such as when adding each other on iMessage. And it severely reduces JavaScript performance in Safari. I think Apple wants to avoid making iOS feel slower or clunkier than Android. And zero-day spyware is usually targeted towards important individuals, not used for mass surveillance, so it indeed is a smaller risk to individual people.I&#x27;d prefer a third mode that compromises between the two, perhaps letting you lower your security for a few minutes when you need the extra functionality. For example, Safari could detect when JavaScript is being slow and pop up an offer to re-enable JIT. reply Obscurity4340 9 hours agorootparentI would argue that iMessage is way to problematic to be used safetly, at all. By anyone. Full-stop. It also seems to be the primary attack vector of NSO related zero-days as well and its become known that phone country&#x2F;area codes have relevance to its chance of succes in past exploits, which suggests a phone&#x2F;messaging type attack vector. reply computator 8 hours agorootparentThat fact that Apple blended iMessages, SMS text messages, and email into an extremely confusing mess may also be the reason for so many security issues related to iMessage. Perhaps not directly responsible for this particular NGO exploit, but I find iMessage&#x27;s logic and behavior bewildering at times.For example: If you stop using WhatsApp for example, nothing bad happens if you try to send messages another way. But if you stop using iMessage, then you can no longer send a normal SMS to someone with whom you&#x27;ve communicated before using iMessage. The Messages app will tell you, \"You must enable iMessage to send this message\", even if it&#x27;s an SMS text message to a normal phone number! Why shouldn&#x27;t that work?To be able to again send SMS text messages to someone you used to talk with is to disable iMessage of course, then sign out of Facetime (who could imagine that as a necessary step?), sign out of iCloud, reboot the iPhone, and wait some minutes to hours to days until you are \"deregistered\" from iMessage. I&#x27;m talking about the same phone with the same SIM chip. The problem can become much worse if you&#x27;ve switched phones or SIM card.The source code for iMessage must be a nightmare having integrated SMS and email and a new messaging system all together. reply jupp0r 7 hours agorootparentThere is no email (the protocol) in iMessage (the app). You can use somebody&#x27;s email address as the recipient for an iMessage (the protocol). No email is ever sent. reply mattnewton 6 hours agorootparentYou can type in a contact with an email address by just their name and send an email from iMessage. I have done it to contacts accidentally many times. reply lotsofpulp 6 hours agorootparentI think sending SMS to emails and receiving SMS from emails is a functionality of the mobile network. You should be able to do that in any app that can send&#x2F;receive SMS.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.att.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;article&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;KM1061254&#x2F; reply kn0where 5 hours agorootparentThe point is that those other apps don’t use email addresses as the handle to contact someone. If someone iMessages you, the iMessage might (appear to) come from their phone number, or it could (appear to) come from their email. If you have an iMessage contact that’s just an email and you iMessage them, it works fine. If you try to then add Android users to your group chat, everyone gets SMS and the iMessage user with an email handle gets an empty body email from AT&T with an attachment containing the SMS as a plaintext file. And then this user gets another empty email for every reply to that group text. reply stephenr 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m fairly certain that \"text to email\" is a feature of MMS - I&#x27;ve used it a few times years before iPhones were around.I don&#x27;t remember if MMS is enabled by default in iOS but theres a toggle to disable it, and realistically there&#x27;s very minimal real world use-case for MMS these days. reply lotsofpulp 4 hours agorootparentprevOh, I have never come across that because I have avoided MMS like the plague ever since WhatsApp&#x2F;Signal&#x2F;any other cross platform messaging option with media capability became available. reply JonathonW 5 hours agorootparentprevOn Apple&#x27;s end, iMessage also supports email addresses as a user identifier (and it&#x27;s the only one you get if you don&#x27;t have an iPhone with an assigned phone number).It&#x27;s still not sending emails, though. The iPhone Messages app sends SMS, MMS, and iMessage; email is the responsibility of the Mail app. reply ThePowerOfFuet 4 hours agorootparentprevYou are referring to MMS. reply fblp 6 hours agorootparentprevFor a new iPhone user are there alternatives to using iMessage for texts to avoid this? reply IggleSniggle 5 hours agorootparentYou can disable iMessage and the Messages app will then just send SMS. Or you can install Signal or WhatsApp or whatever reply jesseendahl 5 hours agorootparentDon’t use SMS instead of iMessage though. Then all your texts will be sent across the network without any kind of decent encryption. And WhatsApp is almost unusable unless you consent to uploading all your contacts to Facebook. (IIRC this was the red line that got crossed that caused the WhatsApp founder to quit FB post-acquisition.)Signal is a good recommendation, but you won’t be able to convince 100% of people you need to interact with over text to use Signal. You might convince friends and family, but not acquaintances or random people who might need to text with (like your electrician etc.)Given the tradeoffs, iMessage is pretty good for day-to-day messaging. reply asmor 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a tradeoff. Do you want messages from strangers to run through a bunch of parsers that historically had problems, or do you want to take advantage of your peer group using iMessage.I&#x27;m outside the US, so I don&#x27;t even need to consider. Nobody here uses iMessage, even the people with iPhones. reply emsixteen 3 hours agorootparentprev> And WhatsApp is almost unusable unless you consent to uploading all your contacts to Facebook.What? How-so? I&#x27;ve never allowed it to do that and it works fine for me, across iOS&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Windows. reply regecks 2 hours agorootparentIt works but it shows phone numbers rather than contact names and you can’t assign a name to a number without giving access to your entire contacts … it ticks me off. reply pshirshov 1 hour agorootparentContact scoping on grapheneos solves that. reply emsixteen 2 hours agorootparentprevAh right, fair enough. reply throwaway290 2 hours agorootparentprevYou see userpics though. Works for me... replyraverbashing 1 hour agorootparentprev\"but but my precious text bubble colors!!1\"Yeah, it seems iMessage in iPhone is like IE in Windows, a needlessly ingrained mess for market segmentation purposes reply lloeki 4 hours agorootparentprev> I would argue that iMessage is way to problematic to be used safely, at all.Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but every single time the only part of iMessage (actually Messages.app) that is insecure is the bit that automatically unfurls attachments and the payload is exploiting a vulnerability elsewhere. So any other app unfurling the attachment thus triggering the payload would be equally vulnerable.Imagine ping had a privilege escalation vulnerability and someone does ssh foomachine pingto get root, it&#x27;d be a bit weird to call out ssh as being unsafe because it can execute commands, one of them being able to privesc.Disabling ssh would be a mitigation, and I do wish Messages would disallow unfurling for senders not in the recipient&#x27;s contact list. reply TheDong 2 hours agorootparent> So any other app unfurling the attachment thus triggering the payload would be equally vulnerable.What you&#x27;re missing is that iPhone&#x27;s app sandboxing applies to other apps, not to iMessage.Sure, imessage does have blastdoor and some sandboxing, but it also still has imagent: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-look-at-ime...imagent runs as root and processes incoming messages. whatsapp or signal or whatever cannot ship an unsandboxed always on daemon like imagent.signal&#x2F;whatsapp&#x2F;etc have to parse incoming messages inside the app sandbox. iMessage doesn&#x27;t.(I&#x27;m saying this all very confidently because the quickest way to get the right answer is to be confident about the wrong one and get corrected by a techbro) reply lloeki 47 minutes agorootparent> imagent [...] processes incoming messagesdoes it?IIUC (from a cursory look) according to the diagram it delegates all message processing to MessageBlastDoorService&#x2F;IM{Transfer,Transcoder,Persistence}Agent, relying only on locally computed boolean-ish metadata replies from these services, and merely transparently forwarding actual data between those. reply saagarjha 3 hours agorootparentprevIt’s an attack vector because it’s convenient. If iMessage didn’t exist people would email you exploits. reply VHRanger 12 minutes agorootparentAre there zero click exploits in email? reply _jal 7 hours agorootparentprevI agree, and there really need to be controls on it. I understand they want the \"IMessage Network\" to have predictable functionality, but I care about security more, and IMessage has been demonstrably unsafe for a long time.I would really prefer to keep it text-only, and am fine with the goofy symbols. If they want to make photo exchange safe, they have the hardware to securely sign images taken on-device and only allow those.[1] (Although that would probably piss off regulators even more.)[1] With some work, this could be a new feature, used to demonstrate images haven&#x27;t been altered. With some lockdown of the clock, it could have secure timestamps. (Location could still be spoofed with a GPS hijack.) reply sneak 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also insecure. The sync keys for iMessage are backed up in the non-e2ee iCloud Backup, which means that iCloud serves as a key escrow for iMessage&#x27;s e2ee, rendering it useless (as Apple, which is definitively not an endpoint, has a private key of the participant and can read all the messages in real-time).iMessage should be assiduously avoided. reply jxcl 9 hours agorootparentThis is less true now, with the option to enable “advanced data protection”. Turning this setting on disables Apple’s access to your iMessage keys along with a bunch of other stuff, though of course if you get locked out, Apple can’t help you reply highwaylights 5 hours agorootparentI don’t believe this is true. You can change your iCloud password at any time, which means they definitely are not encrypting your iCloud data based on that key or a derivative. If I had to guess, they generate a key and encrypt that key with your password so it can be changed but they also aren’t able to produce it on request.The drawback here is that the encryption key for your data never changes, even if you change your password (the private key is just re-encrypted with the new password).If they’ve implemented it well then this is mostly academic but it does mean they must be escrowing encrypted keys for every account, and those with ADP enabled are just encrypted against their password rather than the Apple key. It also means if they’ve suffered an undetected breach in the past then changing your password doesn’t help protect your data going forward necessarily. That being said, if an attacker had ongoing access to iCloud data then it probably doesn’t matter (although the presumably-more-secure key vault wouldn’t need to be breached again).I have no insight into Apple’s practices and this is all speculation, this is just the trade-off I would make to keep it usable. reply asmor 4 hours agorootparentThe keys in advanced protection are derived from your device passcodes, your macOS user password and a recovery key. You&#x27;ll notice you have to approve from one of your devices to use iCloud web or add a new device.The deviation function takes a while to run and depends on the secure enclave, but you still probably want to avoid 4-digit passcodes. reply sneak 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s opt-in, so approximately nobody uses it.Unless BOTH ends of a conversation are using it, it&#x27;s pointless.This means that turning it on does nothing in terms of privacy, in practice, today. All of the iMessages you send and receive will be readable using the escrowed keys from the other users you are messaging with.Perhaps at some point Apple will prompt or nudge people to migrate, but that&#x27;s unlikely given the risks to data loss for people who forget their credentials (and have \"nothing to hide\"). reply rodgerd 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, and this is the sort of thing that I think drives Apple&#x27;s care in recommending the most secure modes; they don&#x27;t want people causally turning it on and discovered that they&#x27;ve buggered themselves up. reply glompers 5 hours agorootparentI agree with you; Amazon servers receiving 80,000 or 800,000 requests per second or 8,000,000 is all a different ballgame than it is for 800 individual actual families around the world (or 8,000 or 80,000) to get their telephones totally buggered up before work that morning on any given workday -- just because somebody trustworthy has advised them to play it super safe without making equally sure the listeners were understanding the UX difficulties of recovering their smartphone&#x27;s functionality in certain mundane use cases, etc, which would ensue. That&#x27;s a lot of panic to deal with. Apple user help forum volunteers would be helpless to reach all the affected frustrated people. reply hackmiester 8 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t have to use iCloud Backup. reply sneak 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s on by default, which means everyone you iMessage with is escrowing the keys that allow Apple to decrypt all of the messages. Turning it off on only one end of the conversation has no meaningful effect. reply Obscurity4340 9 hours agorootparentprevWas going to mention. iMessage seems to be that golden key thing the FBeye asked them for back in 2015 in San Bernadino (insofar as iCloud itself isn&#x27;t a&#x2F;the key itself, already) reply kbenson 10 hours agorootparentprevI think attackers would just try to make the system offer to disable security whenever possible then. Anything as easy as clicking an already offered option by the OS itself will be used often enough to negate most of the security benefits of that mode IMO, meaning you deal with it being slower be default and probably not as secure as you think because people will opt out often for convenience, so the worst of both worlds.As I understand it this was a real problem with earlier versions of Windows where it kept asking for admin privileges all the time for simple things, and people got conditioned to just authorize it. They made a concerted effort to provide APIs that didn&#x27;t require it for most actions to combat this. reply barryrandall 10 hours agorootparentprevI’d settle for being able to toggle the individual controls (specifically iMessage attachments) instead of full lockdown mode. reply jiofj 9 hours agorootparentYES! Current lockdown mode proposition of all-or-nothing is inconvenient. reply sneak 9 hours agorootparentYou can leave lockdown off, and disable iMessage. reply runeks 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t want to disable iMessage, just attachments from unknown contacts. reply klausa 9 hours agorootparentprevWhy increase your security bug surface 2x when you can increase it exponentially! reply bonestamp2 9 hours agorootparentprevI assume that inconvenience is intentional -- otherwise everyone would enable it. reply n8cpdx 8 hours agorootparentprevYou can turn off lockdown mode per site and per-app in safari.

Specifically, there was likely an issue in the JPEG&#x2F;PNG image decoders that are part of CoreGraphics framework on iOS.When rendering a PassKit image attachment, the iMessage app would call CGImageCreateWithJPEGData or CGImageCreateWithPNGData to decode the attached image file. However, the decoders likely did not properly bounds check the dimensions specified in the image header.By crafting a malicious JPEG&#x2F;PNG that specified inflated dimensions, an attacker could cause the decoders to allocate an overly large buffer to hold the decoded pixel data. When copying pixel data from the file into the buffer, the attacker could overflow the bounds of the buffer and overwrite adjacent memory.The PassKit image preview process likely ran with elevated system privileges intended for rendering app content seamlessly. So the overflow could allow overwriting pointers stored in adjacent memory. By overwriting a function pointer, the attacker could divert code execution to their own shellcode embedded in the image file.The shellcode would then disable memory protections like ASLR and DEP that normally prevent arbitrary code execution. This would allow the attacker to execute a ROP gadget chain or other payload to jailbreak the sandbox and run remote commands on the device. reply codyd51 3 hours agoparentThere are some misconceptions in your comments that I think could be useful to clear up.When exploiting a running system, your goal typically won&#x27;t be to disable ASLR (which would only impact newly spawned processes), but instead to &#x27;infoleak&#x27; where ASLR has placed important things you care about, so you know where to access them.Modern devices have mechanisms like KPP&#x2F;KTRR, though, which make it impossible to modify kernel code anyhow.You also propose that CoreGraphics might not be sandboxed. CoreGraphics is a dynamic library which can be loaded into any process. It&#x27;s _processes_ that are sandboxed, not dynamic libraries, so CoreGraphics can definitely exist in a process that has a sandbox profile applied just fine.You also mention that graphics functions might not be sandboxed because they need to access graphics acceleration features. This is a good thought! In fact, the kernel extension that enables hardware graphics acceleration, IOMobileFramebuffer, is accessible from the app sandbox for this very reason. As a point of interest, many vulnerabilities have been discovered in IOMobileFramebuffer over the years -- it&#x27;s an attractive target specifically because it&#x27;s reachable from the app sandbox.Lastly, you mention jailbreaking the sandbox. I know what you mean, but \"jailbreaking\" typically refers to a series of abilities, such as the ability to control the kernel task, the ability to create RWX pages, the ability to bypass the FreeBSD MAC policies, etc. The ability to bypass sandbox restrictions is only one condition of a jailbreak, and a sandbox escape doesn&#x27;t imply a full jailbreak. Also, jailbreaking doesn&#x27;t entirely break \"the sandbox\" -- it&#x27;s a selective change that can be applied on a per-process basis. reply tuyiown 1 hour agorootparent> You also propose that CoreGraphics might not be sandboxed.

CoreGraphics frameworks are likely not sandboxed themselves. So memory corruption there could still lead to privilege escalation. * The CoreGraphics frameworks like CGImage are core system libraries that predate Apple&#x27;s sandboxing technologies. They were likely not designed with sandboxing in mind. * These graphics libraries need to be able to access hardware acceleration features like OpenGL&#x2F;Metal, read and write image files, and render to the screen. Sandboxing them would likely break many of those features. * Apple may have determined that completely sandboxing mature system frameworks like CoreGraphics would impose too much performance overhead across the OS. * As a result, for backwards compatibility and performance reasons, Apple seems to have exempted these core graphics libraries from being sandboxed processes.- The sandbox profile may allow more syscalls or access than necessary. The syscall filter is still in \"permissive\" mode. So kernel escalation could still be possible.- Payload encryption and upload to iCloud bypasses blastdoor. So compromise of an external service could have allowed running outside the sandbox. reply glitchcrab 1 hour agorootparentMore LLM generated nonsense I suspect replysaagarjha 3 hours agoparentprevThe bug is in the WebP decoder. Shellcode execution is not been a thing on iOS because of codesigning.

This would allow the attacker to execute a ROP gadget chain or other payload to jailbreak the sandbox and run remote commands on the device.This sounds like chicken - egg scenario. Can you clarify how original shellcode bypasses those protections?I don’t think you can disable DEP on runtime. reply kafrofrite 3 hours agorootparentDEP is a Windows implementation of a non-executable stack, i.e., memory permissions that do not allow execution on specific pages. Depending on the situation, an attacker can e.g., mmap() a new page with the execute permission set, write his shellcode there and jump there. Another way to bypass the NX bit is to actually use gadgets (snippets of code essentially) that are already there in the code thus they can be executed and redirect your instruction pointer to those addresses. Reusing code is generally known as ROP, JOP etc. and is mitigated by PAC for ARM (after v.8.3) and CFI for Intel (11th Gen onwards I believe).That being said, Apple implements a ton of mitigations, both on a hardware level and on a software level which generally makes exploits on Apple devices interesting to analyze and see how they bypassed stuff.Edit: For clarity, Apple requires both codesigning and implements PAC, among others. mmap&#x27;ing or ROP won&#x27;t make the cut in this case. reply xyst 1 hour agoparentprevWow, so pretty much any app that renders images can be impacted.

Whenever you see \"zero click\" you know it&#x27;s one of the complex payloads like images, fonts. The answer shouldn&#x27;t be \"don&#x27;t render images\". We should be able to trust that a component that parses external data such as an image, simply can&#x27;t do anything malicious regardless of input.If that means sandboxing, fine. If it means having to rewrite all the image parsers from the ground up in a safe language or formally prove them correct, fine. Just get on with it. Apple is rich enough to be able to run their own space program ten times over, I think they could write provably correct imaging libs too. reply astrange 18 minutes agorootparentYour problem isn&#x27;t the quality of your own code, it&#x27;s that Google exists and is unable to stop their employees from doing stupid things like inventing WebP, because now you need to support WebP too which means using their code to do it.(Worse, WebP is at least two completely different formats - the lossless mode has nothing to do with the lossy mode.) reply alkonaut 15 minutes agorootparentI think Apple should either sandbox or reimplement even the most complex formats. Video formats might be painfully complex to implement, but to avoid zero-click you don&#x27;t even need to safeguard the whole process.

Tim Cook could drop 1% of their cash on hand and see how many of them would turn down a million or two as a signing bonus, and if that didn’t work he could escalate to 10% or toss in some stock. I find it unlikely that wouldn’t tempt a lot of people, especially since the U.S. is one of Israel’s staunchest allies so it’d be pretty easy to tell yourself that pile of cash isn’t selling out.The real reason they don’t do that is trust: how could you ever be confident that someone wasn’t passing information back to Unit 8200 or even helping them out? reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentI think you’re misunderstanding.

It may slow them down a bit, you may have a wait a bit longer for the next iteration of some gadget. But that&#x27;s a small price to pay in my opinion.As for the NSO group: I&#x27;m suggesting that Apple use their well filled cash coffers to buy these guys out, and failing that that they use some of that money to sue them for all of the damages that Apple incurs as a result of their actions as well as any criminal charges that they might get to stick.

I think a lot of developers are worried that their two person consulting team is suddenly liable for bugs but it’s totally reasonable to say that Tim Cook should shake the spare change out of his office couch, call Graydon Hoare into his office and say “here’s a billion dollars, who should we hire so I never hear the phrase ‘buffer overflow’ again?” reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentExactly.

They get to the point of having a fast PDF library in C++ that has all the features. Then they realise that they should have written it in a safer language but by that point it means a complete rewrite.The same reason not enough people use Bazel.

Lack of safety elsewhere might end up using code that is otherwise safe in order to build an exploit (by sending it something invalid that breaks an invariant, or building gadgets out of it, etc.). reply bombolo 11 hours agorootparentprevAdding something in rust into a browser means you now need to bundle all of the needed crates and that your browser now also needs rustc to build… at a minimum.You also need potentially to audit all the crates and keep them up to date and so on… without crates you can&#x27;t do so much. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentI can see that for components heavily interfacing with high surface area things like encryption, hardware interfacing etc., but why would that be true for a relatively “pure” computational problem like an image codec?

Sure, the JBIG VM won&#x27;t be, but some random fuzzing should easily trigger out of bounds reads or writes.Lockdown mode alters the iMessage user flow to such an extent that I don&#x27;t see Apple enabling it by default. I don&#x27;t think Lockdown prevents the RCE exploit, but I do think it simply blocks iMessage interactions from unknown numbers, so that the exploit can&#x27;t even load. reply saagarjha 10 hours agorootparentprevWhile not discounting the need to increase investment in this area, I will mention that there are very few things that can be solved by #buzzwords and #hashtags. reply eviks 4 hours agorootparentThen a few of those things are very important like security exploits, so #memory-safe it all the way reply UncleMeat 9 hours agorootparentprevCoverage-guided fuzzing is extremely powerful and has proven to be very effective at finding oodles of vulns.

    "originBody": "SKIP TO MAIN CONTENT BIZ & IT TECH SCIENCE POLICY CARS GAMING & CULTURE STORE FORUMS SUBSCRIBE SIGN IN THE ADS WILL KEEP COMING — Google gets its way, bakes a user-tracking ad platform directly into Chrome Chrome now directly tracks users, generates a \"topic\" list it shares with advertisers. RON AMADEO - 9/7/2023, 3:35 PM Enlarge / Google's not looking as good as it used to. Aurich Lawson 206 WITH Don't let Chrome's big redesign distract you from the fact that Chrome's invasive new ad platform, ridiculously branded the \"Privacy Sandbox,\" is also getting a widespread rollout in Chrome today. If you haven't been following this, this feature will track the web pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it's built directly into the Chrome browser. It's been in the news previously as \"FLoC\" and then the \"Topics API,\" and despite widespread opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world, Google owns Chrome and is one of the world's biggest advertising companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds. Google seemingly knows this won't be popular. Unlike the glitzy front-page Google blog post that the redesign got, the big ad platform launch announcement is tucked away on the privacysandbox.com page. The blog post says the ad platform is hitting \"general availability\" today, meaning it has rolled out to most Chrome users. This has been a long time coming, with the APIs rolling out about a month ago and a million incremental steps in the beta and dev builds, but now the deed is finally done. Chrome users will see this pop-up, telling them the ad platform has rolled out to them. Aurich Lawson Users should see a pop-up when they start up Chrome soon, informing them that an \"ad privacy\" feature has been rolled out to them and enabled. The new pop-up has been hitting users all week. As you can see in the pop-up, all of Google's documentation about this feature feels like it was written on opposite day, with Google calling the browser-based advertising platform \"a significant step on the path towards a fundamentally more private web.\" Advertisement FURTHER READING Everybody hates “FLoC,” Google’s tracking plan for Chrome ads The argument here is that someday—not now, but someday—Google promises to turn off third-party tracking cookies in Chrome, and the new ad platform, which has some limitations, is better than the free-for-all that is third-party cookies. The thing is, third-party cookies mostly only affect Chrome users. Apple and Firefox have both been blocking third-party cookies for years and won't be implementing Google's new advertising system—it's only the Chromium browsers that still allow them. That's actually what started this whole process: Apple dealt a giant blow to Google's core revenue stream when it blocked third-party cookies in Safari in 2020. While it was a win for privacy, Google's not following suit until it can secure its advertising business. The Federated Learning of Cohorts and now the Topics API are part of a plan to pitch an \"alternative\" tracking platform, and Google argues that there has to be a tracking alternative—you can't just not be spied on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also argued this when it called Google's FLoC a \"terrible idea,\" saying \"[Google's] framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between 'old tracking' and 'new tracking.' It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.\" Chrome has some controls for this built into the browser now. Just go to the Chrome Settings, then \"Privacy and Security,\" then \"Ad privacy\" (alternatively, paste \"chrome://settings/adPrivacy\" into the address bar). From there, you can click through to each of the three individual pages and turn off the top checkbox, and in a mere six clicks, you can presumably turn off the ad platform. If you leave it on for a while, you can check out the \"Ad topics\" page, where Google will show you what ads Chrome things you would like to see. This list gets sent to advertisers when you visit a page. Google says it will block third-party cookies in the second half of 2024—presumably after it makes sure the \"Privacy Sandbox\" will allow it to keep its profits up. Did any user in the world want a user tracking and ad platform baked directly into their browser? Probably not, but this is Google, and they control Chrome, and this probably still won't make people switch to Firefox.

Privacy Sandbox is a project, consisting of many proposals. To pitch it as some cohesive product is misleading.2. Related: FLoC and Topics are completely separate things, aside from existing under the same project.3. Topics is reducible to (implementable using) third-party cookies. While the proposal has issues and doesn’t resist tracking as well as Google claims (see below article), Ars’ implication that this is somehow making Chrome less privacy-preserving is patently false.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2306.03825 reply chrismorgan 5 hours agoparentAlthough the source article here is clearly opinionated in one direction, I’m not impressed with your claims about actual problems in it. (For reference, I agree with the direction it takes and would make only minor adjustments to it if I were writing it—the only of any substance would be not calling the Privacy Sandbox an “ad platform” just because in a way it’s a little more like a shop that sells picks to ad platforms.)> 1. Privacy Sandbox is a project, consisting of many proposals. To pitch it as some cohesive product is misleading.Look, that’s how Google are branding it. It’s an initiative which has turned into a cohesive brand. Just look at how https:&#x2F;&#x2F;privacysandbox.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-... speaks of it all. That’s pretty much how it’s being presented in the browser, too.> 2. Related: FLoC and Topics are completely separate things, aside from existing under the same project.They’re about as completely separate as Chrome 17 and Chrome 117, or StarOffice and OpenOffice.org. OK, these are both very imperfect comparisons, but although FLoC and Topics work in somewhat different ways, Topics is for all practical purposes just a fork that continues FLoC. They even treated it that way in the browser (at the time at least, no idea if it’s still so). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts#... seems overall a fair enough portrayal. They simply rebranded the basic concept.> 3. Topics is reducible to (implementable using) third-party cookies. While the proposal has issues and doesn’t resist tracking as well as Google claims (see below article), Ars’ implication that this is somehow making Chrome less privacy-preserving is patently false.The first and last claims here are obvious nonsense. Third-party cookies only let you track stuff where your code runs, whereas the Topics API uses the entire browser history, so it’s not reducible to third-party cookies unless you mean something very different from me by that word. Ars’ implication is by no means patently false; as far as the current status is concerned, where they’ve added this and not removed third-party cookies, it’s patently true. In the longer term, it’s less clear, better in some ways and worse in others, but “patently false” is still an unreasonable characterisation. reply charcircuit 5 hours agorootparent>whereas the Topics API uses the entire browser historyIt doesn&#x27;t use the full history. If a site is using the Topics API it will only get back topics that it has observed from sites in the last 3 epochs. For site X to observe a topic from site Y.

The Topics API is designed so topics can only be returned for API callers that have already observed them, within a limited timeframe. An API caller is said to have observed a topic for a user if it has called the document.browsingTopics() method in code included on a site that the Topics API has mapped to that topic. reply troupo 14 minutes agorootparentThis doesn&#x27;t say that topics only come from the same website. It only says that if a website has \"observed\" any of the thousand or so topics, one will be provided to that site based on user activity.Edit. Literally last link:> Map browser activity to topics of interest. With the current design of the Topics API, topics are inferred from the hostnames of pages the user visits. replyseanhunter 2 hours agoparentprev> Topics is reducible to (implementable using) third-party cookies.Yes, but aren&#x27;t 3rd party cookies going to get banned? That seems to be the common assumption in the adtech space.

I did not detect such an implication. The gist of the article for me was Google is using a new system. Perhaps there is an implication that based on the deceptive use of the term \"privacy\" some users might believe that Chrome is now more privacy preserving. That would of course be patently false.But it seems this comparison to third party cookies ignores the fact that now one company, Google, gets a maximum amount of tracking data without having to cooperate with any other entity. That potentially could be a loss for privacy because the concentration of personal data at one entity, i.e., Google, requires less cooperation, e.g., data sharing. It&#x27;s easier. reply cageface 6 hours agoparentprevRon Amadeo has such a consistently snarky anti Google stance that I no longer read his articles.

They&#x27;ve been doing this for years.So this new \"privacy sandbox\" is a diversion to the public, and particularly to law makers, that signals \"see, we care about user privacy\". When in fact it ultimately makes no impact on their revenue.The public and law makers are barely starting to get an understanding about cookies, and there&#x27;s a growing concern about them, so this is Google being proactive towards the blowback. Fingerprinting is much more complex to understand, and concern about it is so under the radar, that it will take many more years for the focus to catch up to these nefarious practices.The frog is being boiled[1], make no mistake about that.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gazoche.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;boiling-frog&#x2F; reply summerlight 4 hours agoparent> Modern adtech can track users regardless if cookies are enabled or not, and whether they enable this new Chrome feature or not, via browser fingerprinting. They&#x27;ve been doing this for years.One of the explicit goal of \"privacy sandbox\" is preventing browser fingerprinting by limiting informational entropy from user environment. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikewest&#x2F;privacy-budget reply bad_user 5 hours agoparentprevIn the EU, as far as the ePrivacy Directive (cookie law) is concerned, fingerprinting is similar to using a tracking cookie, even if no cookies are actually involved. And as far as GDPR is concerned, fingerprinting can identify a visitor, it counts as personal data, therefore you need a legal basis for processing it.Not sure what the point you&#x27;re trying to make is.Also, Google under Privacy Sandbox has been exploring ways to introduce a fingerprinting limitations and a budget. Which may as well be smoke and mirrors, but if you watch their marketing materials, they talk of fingerprinting in general. reply imiric 40 minutes agorootparentSites that use tracking cookies rarely comply with the law as it is, and even then skirt around it via \"legitimate interests\" and other dark patterns. What makes you think they would disclose a behavior that is even more difficult to detect?We can&#x27;t assume good will and behavior from an industry that is built on deceiving and manipulating the user. The GDPR is a good first step at regulating these practices, but it&#x27;s too vague, and it&#x27;s applied far too leniently. It also obviously only applies to EU citizens, and not to the global industry.I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the privacy \"budget\", but it sounds like Google is trying to define privacy as a scale, where some amount of fingerprinting is OK. Users can be identified with just a few data points, and some are more valuable, depending on the context. Some might even be required for the site to function, so will there be \"legitimate\" exceptions to the budget in those cases? It sounds like a backwards approach that will be difficult to manage, so I&#x27;m not sure it will be a win for protecting privacy.More importantly, I don&#x27;t trust that an adtech company will go out of its way to implement solutions that go against its bottom line. These companies have a track record of abusing user data, and the only reason they take these initiatives is for good PR, which is again protecting their bottom line. The entire industry needs much broader and stronger regulation for any of this to actually improve. reply pharmakom 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah and the Legal Basis will be something like “we need to track users to improve our services” reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not a lawful basis under GDPR.

Legitimate interest requires them to pass \"purpose\", \"necessity\" and \"balancing\" tests. The \"balancing\" test in particular balances the companies interests against the interest of the user in maintaining privacy.

The same way newspapers said \"stop linking headlines to us\" and then once some popular service did and all their traffic disappeared they came back and said \"oh, wait, no, you can link to us\"For the ads, a large portion of the internet that people want (maybe not you in particular but lots of people in general), run on ads.

To name a few sites that might be popular hereIf those sites can&#x27;t support themselves they&#x27;ll more than likely disappear. If all those sites disappeared I feel like plenty of people (maybe not you but more people than not) would realize that they thought they wanted (zero disclose) lead to outcomes they didn&#x27;t wantI feel like Google is genuinely trying to do something positive here. Provide a way of those sites to still target ads, still check if an ad was effective, still try to check for bad actors making fake clicks, but also be practically un-attributable to a single user.Going through the actual specs, they really are trying to make it so you can&#x27;t track and individual but sites can still function based on ads.Is it in Google own interest? Yes. But it&#x27;s also in the interest of sites people want which means it&#x27;s also in the interest of the people who want those sites.Apple on the other hand, would prefer you be tracked directly by having you download an app for each site where that app can track you way more than a browser with these features can track you. reply rapind 2 hours agorootparent> If those sites can&#x27;t support themselves they&#x27;ll more than likely disappear.Newspapers and television (pre-digital) managed to survive just fine on advertising before tracking was feasible. There are also subscription services. Content is not going to simply disappear if tracking goes away. Sites that depend on tracking for their survival will adapt or die, but that&#x27;s fine, businesses fail every day, and I&#x27;m certainly not sympathetic to businesses who depend on what I would call unethical practices.The problem is when regulators ignore an industry for years upon years (capture).

Google is clearly terrified that the tracking protection offered by other browsers is going to become the norm and they’re trying to head that off at the pass by implementing this compromise.

Then the browser could, in fact, just disable third-party cookies without giving advertisers and analytics companies another alternative. reply koolba 9 hours agorootparentprev> Not yet but they can&#x27;t just turn off third party cookies arbitrarily in their browser without giving time for sites and advertisers to update their systems to account for the removal.Of course they can.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority made Google promise they won&#x27;t remove 3rd-party cookies from Chrome before adding alternatives. reply jesstaa 8 hours agorootparentSure they can. They just have to do it in a way that doesn&#x27;t create a disadvantage for other advertising providers.Google isn&#x27;t allowed to stop others tracking you without also removing their own ability to track you because that&#x27;s anti-competitive. reply JoshTriplett 6 hours agorootparentYou are assuming reasonableness on behalf of the regulators in question. In an ideal world, they hopefully said \"you cannot give information to your own advertising&#x2F;analytics division that you don&#x27;t give to others\". However, they could just as easily have said \"you must provide either third-party cookies or a replacement for them\", without offering the much more reasonable alternative of turning both off and not giving Google advertising&#x2F;analytics any information either.So, what did the regulators actually say, and does it in fact allow Google to turn off third-party cookies without any replacement? If it does, then this is Google&#x27;s fault for adding this feature in Chrome. If it doesn&#x27;t, then this is the fault of bad regulation. reply josefx 2 hours agorootparentprevGoogle has a habit of limiting changes it does not like to specific countries.So if they are rolling out a UK mandated feature globally there is no question that Google is all for it. reply ndriscoll 8 hours agorootparentprevThey could also not run a global surveillance panopticon so that there wouldn&#x27;t be an unfair competitive advantage. Or telling the UK to get bent and that they won&#x27;t offer Chrome there is apparently a viable strategy given recent developments with encrypted communication there.In any case, this is still strictly a privacy downgrade to turn on. It&#x27;s still deceptive to imply turning it on improves privacy. reply modeless 8 hours agorootparentprevAfter the launch of this feature they plan to disable third party cookies.

Roll out stuff they brand as “privacy respecting” that actually collects data for their own use.2. Brand anything that would give competitors access to that data (third party cookies, user agent strings, etc) as a threat to user privacy.3. Lock all of that stuff down so that nobody can access it (“we’re protecting you!”)4. I don’t think we need the ???, it’s just straight to profit, via monopoly over the data.The brilliant&#x2F;terrible thing about this is that third party cookie tracking is not great so it’s hard to set up a defensible argument where leaving things as they are is the better alternative.

I fully support people being forced into detecting the features they want and doing away with this nonsense, reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think web developers should be able to detect stuff like that either. Their ability to detect stuff provides identifying bits for fingerprinting. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, all the browsers should normalize the return values of those typeofs and all related functions so that Javascript can figure out exactly zero bits of information about the environment it&#x27;s running on. Just like browsers will lie to Javascript when it tries to figure out your browsing history by checking the color of links.The web platform gave web developers way too much freedom and they&#x27;re abusing it. God giveth and god taketh away. reply Groxx 6 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s simply no way that can ever be built though. \"Browser v2 provides X which will call argument 1 in 2 seconds\" -> how would browser v1 possibly hide that it is not v2? Anyone can build a thing that checks for that behavior, and now you have a piece of information.Or for more useful stuff, \"X gets you data from URL Y\". Either you get that data or you don&#x27;t. Voila, data about the browser.The only alternative is that you never ever release any new features or fix any bugs. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentHow does cryptography software avoid such side channels? Normalize the performance somehow.If I remember correctly, Firefox&#x27;s fingerprinting resistance will actually slow down functionality to achieve that. Reduces the precision of performance timers or something. Makes CAPTCHAs exponentially more obnoxious. reply Groxx 5 hours agorootparentIt hides that by being incredibly restricted in what you can do with it, lest you leak side channel information. To the point that you can&#x27;t do much of anything useful, much less general computation. They&#x27;re finely crafted Faberge eggs that break if you sneeze near them now or discover a new way of sneezing in the next few decades, not broad tools.So... yes, you could build a \"browser\" like that. It would effectively have no scripting at all though, nor could it ever introduce new semantics that send data to another site, directly or transitively. You can do some stuff with that kind of system, but it&#x27;s limited enough that most people don&#x27;t choose it.Gopher exists I guess? Lynx too, though lynx supports css, and that largely can&#x27;t be allowed either. reply matheusmoreira 4 hours agorootparentSounds good to me. Javascript is too powerful and should be limited. I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry that my browser is executing remotely downloaded code that could exfiltrate an unbounded amount of information about me. They should either they get it right by doing it in a way that doesn&#x27;t harm us, or they shouldn&#x27;t get to do it at all.The web should be fully declarative and permissions&#x2F;capabilities based. If they can&#x27;t do something that way, they shouldn&#x27;t get to do it at all. reply raincole 6 hours agorootparentprev> Feature detection is too much power for developers- People on HN. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentYes, it is too much power for them. Power which they abuse by fingerprinting us. Browser vendors agree with me: they reduced the power of developers by lying to Javascript when they tried to check link styles.Do you think otherwise? reply raincole 6 hours agorootparentA. Test for window.fetch.B. Check if a link is visited.Whether these two even remotely fall into the same category is left as an exercise for readers. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentA. Provides bits of identifying information.B. Provides bits of identifying information.To me it seems they&#x27;re in the exact same category. reply raincole 4 hours agorootparentKnowing which key the user pressed? Provides bits of identifying information.Knowing the user&#x27;s mouse position? Provides bits of identifying information.Knowing which subdomain the user is visiting? Provides bits of identifying information.Reading URL query string? Provides bits of identifying information.If this is a category, it&#x27;s a quite big one! reply matheusmoreira 4 hours agorootparentHuh. Now I&#x27;m not sure Javascript should be able to do any of those things either. Now that you mentioned it, I remember reading about how sites fingerprint users by timing keystrokes and mouse movements and numberless other things.Maybe the ultimate conclusion is Javascript should not actually exist at all. The web should be declarative, not executable. Developers tell the browser what they want and the browser does it. If it can&#x27;t be done that way, it isn&#x27;t done.Just like Chrome&#x27;s Manifest V3 making extensions more declarative and limited. My only problem with it is the fact it cripples uBlock Origin. I actually do want those restrictions applied to 100% of all the other extensions, it&#x27;s just that uBlock Origin is too important and trusted and should be an exception. Honestly, uBlock Origin should be literally built into the browsers at this point. The only reason we can&#x27;t have that is the massive conflicts of interest involved: can&#x27;t trust an advertising company to maintain an adblocker. reply technion 4 hours agorootparentprevUsing an Abortcontroller with fetch for example is only recently supported. I like to use it where I can, but I don&#x27;t want to crash on a slightly older browser. Feature detection is absolutely practically useful. reply matheusmoreira 4 hours agorootparentI have no doubt that it&#x27;s useful. My point is it enables abuse towards us and that the potential for abuse overrides the utility.Road to hell is paved with good intentions. When you propose a law, you must also think about the numberless ways it could be abused and misused to cause harm. Same principle applies here. The code shouldn&#x27;t just fail, it should fail in ways that prevent the developer from even knowing it failed much less why. Simply because that would leak information. replySoftTalker 7 hours agorootparentprevThere are plugins for Firefox that can make the user agent string anything you want. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t matter. Actually those plugins are straight up counterproductive.The best user agent is the one that offers them the fewest identifying bits. In other words, the user agent of the most popular version of Chrome. The ability to set it to \"anything we want\" is actually a trap. What we really want is for everyone to use the exact same user agent so they can&#x27;t tell us apart.If everyone has the same user agent, it&#x27;s nothing but a waste of bandwidth and it should be removed. Google is actually achieving our objective here. reply SoftTalker 5 hours agorootparentWell yeah, they have a pre-configured set of choices, e.g. \"Chrome on Windows\" but you can do something custom too, if you want. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprevFirefox has plugins to set your user agent to Chrome. reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparentPointless. Firefox should just pretend to be Chrome by default without the user having to install plugins or even do literally anything. As should all the other browsers. Anything that leaks out the fact it&#x27;s not Chrome should be considered a bug and fixed. replyinfogulch 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m all on board calling Google out for slowly implementing a user data protection racket, where Google owns all the data and everyone else is squeezed out and has to go through Google as The central data broker. At the same time this user agent reduction thing seems like a decent idea at first blush and good for users privacy. reply dpkirchner 8 hours agorootparentTBH I&#x27;m surprised the User-Agent header has survived as long as it has. Referer, too. reply omoikane 7 hours agorootparentReferer is not quite the same as how it was. In recent years, the default behavior in most cases is for the browser to either send just the origin, or no referer at all.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;Headers&#x2F;Re...\"Origin\" means no path, so the referer might tell me which search engine the user used, but not what search query was done. It&#x27;s much better than in the old days, where I might even see someone&#x27;s session ID in the referer. reply judge2020 6 hours agorootparentYouTube got around this in the earlier days since the referer header didn’t sent query strings. Maybe if referer hadn’t existed, YouTube urls would look like &#x2F;watch&#x2F;ViDeOID reply ravenstine 8 hours agorootparentprevThat header and Referer were always a mistake. I don&#x27;t think The Google&#x27;s motivation is pure, but I agree in principle.A lot of sites will break for people as a result, though. Maybe that&#x27;s what The Google wants, though. reply satvikpendem 7 hours agorootparent> Referer were always a mistakeYeah, it&#x27;s even spelled wrong! reply elashri 8 hours agorootparentprevMy web development knowledge is very limited. But isn&#x27;t this the main method where simple websites (most static generators) used to decide if the user is browsing from a mobile or not and serve a version based on that?I would appreciate it if someone explain what other things people do to tackle this, or if I&#x27;m completely wrong? reply jrajav 8 hours agorootparentMost responsive design is based on screen dimensions with CSS media queries these days, not on the actual class of device. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentThough I can see justifications for giving people a different UI depending on whether they use a touch screen or a mouse. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentprevThe modern solution is to use CSS with media queries. You tell the client how the site is supposed to look on various screen sizes. The client applies the rules without leaking any information about which rules it chose to apply. reply yjftsjthsd-h 8 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s mostly done client-side these days; having the server treat clients differently doesn&#x27;t happen as much anymore. reply rascul 8 hours agorootparentprevI think media queries have been the way to do that for awhile. Or I think there&#x27;s some javascript trick to do it. reply cpburns2009 7 hours agorootparentprevThe server now needs to respond with the Accept-CH header specifying it wants the client to send the mobile client header by including the \"UA-Mobile\" value. A compliant client will then send the Sec-CH-UA-Mobile header in its next request with either the value \"?0\" or \"?1\". reply ComputerGuru 6 hours agorootparentNot supported on iOS, which is a good chunk of the mobile traffic you’re trying to identify. reply cpburns2009 5 hours agorootparentYou have to do a split approach. Last I knew only Chrome-based browsers support the new UA headers. Firefox and Safari only support the User-Agent header which you have to check for the presence of \"Mobi\". reply jamesfinlayson 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree that user agent is not the best idea but it helps endlessly when you need to find out what browser a non techy person is using - just ask them to go to one of the endless sites that tells you what browser you&#x27;re using based on the user agent string. reply xref 7 hours agorootparentprevWithout Referer how will jwz dot org troll HN users?! reply soulofmischief 9 hours agorootparentprevIf that were really their motive, a better strategy would be making user agent string customization a first-class feature. reply fiddlerwoaroof 7 hours agorootparentNo, because approximately nobody would customize it. reply soulofmischief 6 hours agorootparentThen generalize it by default. I just can&#x27;t buy that Google really has this motive when they simultaneously are introducing WEI. reply hedora 6 hours agorootparentprevThey could also use the user agent: \"\", or omit the http header entirely. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprevYou can already do that with extension, can&#x27;t you? reply soulofmischief 3 hours agorootparentAn extension isn&#x27;t first-class support, first-class means supported directly in the browser and easily discoverable. reply ben-schaaf 7 hours agorootparentprevWill that finally bring an end to having to use user-agent-switcher to get some sites to work on Firefox? reply afavour 9 hours agoparentprev> Meanwhile Google has access to all this dataI’m loathe the defend Google but I don’t think this is the case. The replacement for user agent sniffing (client hints? I forget) is a universal thing and I don’t think Google has a secret back door tracking mechanism their ad network is able to use. It would certainly be a big story if they did. reply riku_iki 8 hours agorootparent> I don’t think Google has a secret back door tracking mechanism their ad network is able to use.they have 80% population using search, youtube, storing browsing history etc while logged into google account, so they have lots of data about most of the people. reply afavour 8 hours agorootparentRight but that’s not a secret back door tracking mechanism. It’s a pretty blatant one!My point is that even this blatant logged in user tracking won’t be able to use user agent strings to track either. reply asddubs 1 hour agorootparentyou&#x27;re the one who introduced the concept of it being secret, your quote just said they have access reply riku_iki 8 hours agorootparentprevyeah, no need some secret backdoor.. reply notatoad 6 hours agorootparentprevyes, client hints.google \"has access to all this data\" in exactly the same way any other website does. you request the information you need from the client, and the client can choose to provide it or not. clients provide it by default.hate on google all you want, but UA reduction is objectively a good thing. \"my friend jacob wants to slurp up everything from the user-agent string on the first request\" is not a good argument. reply jacquesm 7 hours agorootparentprevYou only need a backdoor if you do not also have a 6 lane highway to your users premises. reply hotstickyballs 9 hours agorootparentprev> I don’t think Google has a secret back door tracking mechanism their ad network is able to use. It would certainly be a big story if they did.Like Chrome?? reply rhaway84773 9 hours agorootparentprevGoogle’s ad network might not have access. But does Google have access?Because there are many ways Google can leverage this data without giving their ad network access.Privacy isn’t just about privacy from ads. There are all sorts of non ad related privacy abuses that can exist. reply foobarian 8 hours agorootparentA while ago now I booked a room on Expedia, which ended in me getting a confirmation email with an itinerary to my Gmail backed address. Lo and behold, few minutes later a CTA pops up on my Android phone offering to create a matching trip in Google&#x27;s trip planning product.

Platform owner gets to protect the user from some of the abuse, while gaining a critical edge on the competition.In the current climate, I&#x27;m not sure there is any good angle to solve this, short of strong regulation limiting the advantage they get from doing these \"privacy first\" moves (basically find a way to forbid the platform owners from using their own users&#x27; data...I&#x27;m not holding my breath) reply eru 6 hours agorootparent> In the current climate, I&#x27;m not sure there is any good angle to solve this, short of strong regulation limiting the advantage they get from doing these \"privacy first\" moves (basically find a way to forbid the platform owners from using their own users&#x27; data...I&#x27;m not holding my breath)Well, you could also look into removing some rules, in addition or instead of piling on new ones. Eg you could weaken intellectual property rights, to make it easier for upstart competitors to take on the established giants.Or you could make it easier for foreign competitors to enter local markets.

    "originBody": "Tales from Kagi Home Blog Kagi Small Web 07 Sep, 2023 As a part of our ongoing pursuit to humanize the web, we are pleased to announce the launch of Kagi Small Web. What is Kagi Small Web? While there is no single definition, “small web” typically refers to the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web, before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started fighting back!) For a deeper understanding, Ben Hoyt’s “The Small Web is Beautiful” serves as an excellent primer. Additionally, our GitHub repository links to several more articles on this topic. Kagi Small Web offers a fresh approach by promoting recently published content from the “small web.” We gather new content, published within the last week, from a handpicked list of blogs and surface it in multiple ways: Directly within Kagi search results for applicable queries (existing Kagi members do not need to do anything, this will be automatic) Via the new Kagi Small Web website Through the Kagi Small Web RSS feed Via our Search API, where results are now part of the news enrichment API Initially inspired by a vibrant discussion on Hacker News, we began our experiment in late July, highlighting blog posts from HN users within our search results. The positive feedback propelled the initiative forward. Today, our evolving concept boasts a curated list of nearly 6,000 genuine websites featuring people with a wide variety of interests. The entire Kagi Small Web initiative, including the list of curated websites, is open-source and can be found on Kagi’s GitHub. Small Web in Kagi Search: A Unique Flavor Since inception, we’ve been featuring content from the small web through our proprietary Teclis and TinyGem search indexes. This inclusion of high-quality, lesser-known parts of the web is part of what sets Kagi’s search results apart and gives them a unique flavor. Today we’re taking this a step further by integrating Kagi Small Web results into the index. For instance, a search for “swiftui” now brings up this intriguing article from the small web. It discusses a noteworthy change in iOS 17 and comes from Keith Harrison’s “Use Your Loaf” blog. Yes, you’ve just met one of your “web neighbors.” (note that the example Kagi search URL has been generated using Kagi’s “Share this Search” feature, enabling users without a Kagi account to view the results) And to compare to the above, see Google’s search results for “swiftui”. Another example: a search for “apple watch” yields this recent piece from Timo’s ‘Screaming at My Screen’ blog. Notice how it adds a fresh perspective to the prevailing opinions on Apple Watch, including a fascinating neighboring result about Apple Watch Pixels from 2015, coming from our Teclis index. Compare this diversity to Google’s results for the same term. We strongly believe that including the results from the “small web” not only brings us closer to a more humane experience in the web search, but makes the search genuinely better! Introducing the Kagi Small Web Website We are also launching the Kagi Small Web website, a new platform through which we want to surface all the recent content from the small web, that usually zips by in legacy search engines. Designed in line with the ethos of the “small web,” our website operates without JavaScript. Here, you can “appreciate” a post or jot down a temporary public note about it. These notes will vanish in about a week as we cycle in new content - emphasizing the fleeting, imperfect nature of the small web. When we previewed the site to a select group of beta testers on our Discord channel, one user was especially excited to find their blog among the curated feeds. Though they hadn’t posted recently and weren’t featured on the KSW website, they felt inspired to write more. This enthusiasm serves as a direct counter to the creeping “adshitification” of the web, encouraging genuine content over commercial clutter. Our selection criteria for the curated feeds are: The blog must have a post at least three years old. Content must be in English (hard to curate non-English). The site should offer authentic self-expression or high informational value. No NSFW For a post to appear on the KSW website, additional conditions include: It needs to be no older than seven days. The site should be compatible with iframe embedding. If it’s not, we’ll still index it for our search results. The website is also open source, and we’re open to merge requests. Discover Small YouTube Explore our experimental “Small YouTube” feature here. It surfaces content from emerging YouTube creators who have fewer than 400k subscribers. Your feedback on this criterion is welcome. Access via Feed and API Obtain real-time updates from Kagi Small Web through our RSS feed, refreshed every 5 hours. For API enthusiasts, Kagi Small Web is integrated into our TinyGem index, offering high-quality, non-mainstream news from around the web at $2 per 1000 queries. How to Contribute and Provide Feedback We’re open to refinements. If you notice omissions or inclusions that don’t fit, please contribute to our curated list following the guidelines. For bug reports and feature suggestions, head to kagifeedback.org and use the small-web tag to categorize your post. For general discussions, join us on Kagi Discord. Final Words The driving question behind this initiative was simple yet profound: the web is made of millions of humans, so where are they? Why do they get overshadowed in traditional search engines, and how can we remedy this? This project required a certain leap of faith as the content we crawl may contain anything, and we are putting our reputation on the line vouching for it. But we also recognize that the “small web” is the lifeblood of the internet, and the web we are fighting for. Those who contribute to it have already taken their own leaps of faith, often taking time and effort to create, without the assurance of an audience. Our goal is to change that narrative. Together with the global community of people who envision a different web, we’re committed to revitalizing a digital space abundant in creativity, self-expression, and meaningful content - a more humane web for all. – Discuss on Hacker News. #kagi",

The RSS feed unexpectedly broke (edit: the feed is back up! [3]) just as we published the blog post, in the true spirt of \"small web\" :) Should be up in 30 minutes which will enable the site to function too (it uses the same feed).This has been a personal pet project of mine and I spent considerable time getting my hands dirty with the code, as the team was busy with other initiatives. When I said the \"feed broke\" for the launch I meant I broke it. Software is messy especially for an old school dev. I learned in the process I am not a very good coder anymore (if I ever was one?), constantly going back and fixing stuff I previously thought was solid. Check it out in the linked repo [1].Most importantly - I found the site replace the need for discovery for me, and getting to know various different humans and their writing felt good! A lot of unexpected stuff surfaced and the web felt close again. I think there is a glimpse of hope in the concept and I hope you see it too. And the improvements to search quality and diversity this brings are real.You can check the list of included websites here [2].

Adding more visibility to the indie&#x2F;small web is a great thing. I&#x27;ve complained in the past on HN that any useful personal blog is buried under spammy content in search engines.It would be nice to also be able to just search within the small web, maybe using a lens in the future?Regarding the topic of self promotion, I would disagree with the current rules and I would ask you to allow people to self promote. As long they have an old enough blog, maybe even cut that down to a year, would be helpful. Most users on the small&#x2F;indie web lack visibility and this would do them service. My blog is already within the index because I think it might have been picked up during the \"HN share your blog\" post that happened a while ago, but others might not have been that lucky. reply skinkestek 12 hours agorootparentThere is already a lens called the non commercial web or something that I suspect overlaps to some degree,but I don&#x27;t think they are equal and I don&#x27;t know if I am right. reply palmer_fox 14 hours agoparentprevThe more I uses Kagi (paid) the more I am feeling sad for the possibility that it might go away if it doesn&#x27;t get more traction.For me you represent an incredible accomplishment: the first search engine that gives better results than Google, respects privacy, offers customization and so much more.Thank you. reply Phemist 12 hours agorootparentSometimes I have to use somebody else&#x27;s laptop, for some reason or other I end up searching for something. I think, why are these results so crap?I notice google&#x2F;bing and quickly kick in my muscle memory built up over the years to type duckduckgo.com and do another search.After this I still am confused why the results are so crap. Then I notice the duck laughing at me and think... shouldnt this be a dog?And then I start feeling bad for the original user of the device and tell them to do the search themselves and let me know when they get a result reply Phemist 12 hours agorootparentJust to say: the search engine frog has long been boilt and it is amazing what crap people have to put up with when searching for anything.

Just felt like it might be a bit disingenuous to quote a blog list as inspiration for a search engine focused on \"the non-commercial part of the web\" which is exactly your engine&#x27;s aim and wording, didn&#x27;t know they&#x27;ve been working on small web initiatives since a similar timeline.Hopefully you both find success and with it uplift hobbyist websites. reply flexagoon 3 hours agorootparentprevKagi actually uses Marginalia as one of its result sources, especially if you enable the \"non-commercial\" lens! reply sergiosgc 16 hours agoparentprevCongratulations on the initiative.

Always assumed it would be higher since I&#x27;m constantly searching stuff for my job, but I guess 30 is kind of a lot when you think about it.So this may not be as big of an issue as you think. Should also keep in mind that higher search quality means you don&#x27;t have to search as much in the first place, which leaves a larger buffer.Alternatively you could just use \"hashbangs\" to search domains via google (!g), since I don&#x27;t believe those cost you anything. reply lukas099 16 hours agorootparentprevAdditional searches above your tier are not expensive, 1.5 cents I believe.

Kagi essentially does the same thing as Searx: anonymized API calls to 3rd party search engines. It&#x27;s just packaged in a friendlier UI, but the experience is not far off.Plus, Searx supports many more search engines, and I can customize it exactly to my liking.I wish them well, as they clearly have good intentions and a good product, but I prefer using an equivalent OSS and self-hosted solution over a proprietary SaaS I have to create an account for, even if it&#x27;s not as polished or featureful.EDIT: Actually, I&#x27;m wrong. Kagi apparently also has their own crawlers and indexes[1]. Still, I&#x27;m not finding Searx results to be deficient, so I&#x27;m not missing out on much.One thing that does concern me with Searx, and partially with Kagi, is that those 3rd parties could decide to block these API requests at any point, leaving Searx unusable, and Kagi&#x27;s results less relevant. I&#x27;m not sure this is a sustainable way to build a search engine, but I do appreciate both Kagi&#x27;s and Searx&#x27;s stance on ads.

In my experience, recent updates make the weakest search results, more prone to updates and link breakage, and overall tend to be of lower quality. I also wonder if promoting recent content might incentivize pumping out low-quality entries to increase the odds of being listed.#2 In dabbling in the domain I&#x27;ve always ended up with an almost absurd skew toward technical programmer:y blogs. While there is a strong overlap between the cohort with a blog, and the cohort with programmer interests, I feel it would be more inviting to other groups if other interests were better represented. Is this something you&#x27;ve thought about, and if so, what do you think might be done? reply freediver 17 hours agoparentHey Viktor!#1 There are a couple of factors.- More recent content tends to be more relevant given the same search query, or at least its freshnes will contribute to it not being completely irrelevant (which is the worse thing you want in a search engine). The quality of it is already guaranteed to some extent by this being a curated list to begin with.- It was relatively easy to assemble and maintain the list because it relies on RSS feed tech, and there were a lot of sources to seed it.- Focus on recent writing can encourage some people to write (more) as we had an example highlighted in the blog post. In general, the web needs more high quality, non-commercial content, and this is ultimately what we want to contribute towards with this. By providing a platform (even if very small) to encourage this behavior we get a step closer to the web we like.#2 In general I agree. Although I should say we did spend effort to create a diverse pool of websites for this initiative (for example I am seeing a lot of economy or photography).

For businesses Low latency, and none of your traffic ever touches our servers. For individuals Low latency, and none of your traffic ever touches our servers. FEATURED Best practices used by billion-dollar companies Read guide Customer Stories Blog Mullvad on Tailscale: Privately browse the web Kabir Sikand, Parker Higgins and James Tucker on September 7, 2023 Tailscale has partnered with Mullvad to make its global network of VPN servers available for our customers. You can now easily browse the web using any one of Mullvad’s available servers as a Tailscale exit node while maintaining the user privacy that’s synonymous with Mullvad. Mullvad is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service that’s known for its strong commitment to user privacy, anonymity, and security. It safeguards user privacy by not logging or monitoring user activity, and it uses a unique account number system for subscriptions, meaning personal data is not tied to your account. Services like Mullvad help you browse the internet more privately. Taking advantage of this new partnership means that even when you’re far from home, you can stay connected to the things you care about via Tailscale and maintain private internet browsing from your tailnet thanks to Mullvad’s secure and high-speed global network. Tailscale vs. Mullvad You may have heard the term VPN being used interchangeably to refer to Tailscale and services like Mullvad. While both uses are technically correct, there’s a stark difference in why you’d use each type of service. Tailscale helps smooth out the connectivity problems of today by building you a personal private internet, which we call a tailnet. This helps you connect to the services and people you care about, securely, from just about anywhere on the planet. Privacy VPNs help you connect to the internet in a secure, private, and anonymous manner. You can protect yourself from advertisers, ISPs, threat actors on a public Wi-Fi network, marketing sites, and more by using a privacy VPN to mask your device identity. Before today, you’d have to roll your own infrastructure to get some of the same benefits of a privacy VPN while using Tailscale. With our Mullvad partnership, that changes. Mullvad is your privacy edge When you use Mullvad, you get instant access to hundreds of servers in 40+ countries around the world. To connect to any one of those servers, your device generates a WireGuard key pair: the public key is used to identify peers in Mullvad’s infrastructure, and the private key is used to encrypt traffic. When you use Tailscale with a Mullvad exit node, it’s the same thing! Your node registers its existing Tailscale-generated WireGuard key pair with Mullvad’s infrastructure. Any traffic coming over the internet is terminated at Mullvad’s network edge, and end-to-end encrypted all the way to your device. Basically, you get to bring Mullvad’s entire fleet of servers into your tailnet. Tailscale is a coordination layer Mullvad never knows who you are; just that a device is connecting to one of its servers to proxy internet-bound traffic. Tailscale acts as a coordination layer between your devices and Mullvad’s network edge. Tailscale’s control layer continually updates the available Mullvad network map, and tells your devices which servers to connect to in each available region or city, and alerts your device of any changes that may affect your connection. Tailscale then lets your device know which Mullvad nodes are available, and sends your device connection information for the selected region or city. From there, traffic goes directly through the connected Mullvad node to the internet. Like other traffic flowing over your tailnet, your data is end-to-end encrypted. Tailscale doesn’t have the private key, so we can’t see your traffic. Using Mullvad Exit Nodes Starting today, you can use Mullvad exit nodes to do things like privately and securely browse the web at home or on-the-go, protect yourself prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, connect to the internet from specific locations around the globe, and forward non-standard port traffic like web, game, or media servers through Mullvad’s network edge. Want to give it a try yourself? To enable Mullvad Exit Nodes, have a tailnet admin head over to the general settings page of your admin console, and click Configure. Select the devices you’d like to use with Mullvad on your tailnet. Configure which devices should have access to Mullvad’s global VPN infrastructure. Continue through the checkout flow to purchase Mullvad licenses. Licenses cost $5 per month for every 5 devices you wish to use. On any device where you’ve granted Mullvad VPN access, you can now select Mullvad exit nodes. Each device can enable or disable an exit node separately. Easily select a Mullvad exit node from your enabled devices. For more information on how to use Mullvad with Tailscale, head over to our documentation. Private and (mostly) anonymous Tailscale is a privacy-first company, and we go out of our way to design our software to preserve the privacy of its users. We’re also an identity-based company, and that property is similarly built into our architecture. Each Tailscale connection is a WireGuard tunnel — which is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that we can’t see the contents of the traffic even if we wanted to, and also authenticated, providing strong guarantees that traffic is flowing between endpoints that are who they claim to be. You can see how this works in the design of the feature we’re announcing today. Mullvad is not sent any of your personal information; while Tailscale knows who you are through associated identity providers, this information is never needed for a connection to Mullvad’s servers. We let your local Tailscale client know where to send over its public WireGuard keys to establish a connection. From there, any traffic to the internet will flow through Mullvad VPN infrastructure, obscuring the personal details of your device, network, and connection from prying eyes. For many use cases, that is a great combination. You get Tailscale’s strong privacy guarantees and a framework that keeps the number of parties with access to your identity to a minimum. It’s not true anonymity, because that’s a problem Tailscale is not trying to solve. But for the many users who want Tailscale’s powerful encryption and ease of use, and whose threat model allows for that kind of conditional anonymity, it works. There are also valid use cases that require privacy and true anonymity. But there are risks to providing these guarantees commercially, as cited by Mullvad and others. Bad actors can take advantage of these services, turning them into abuse vectors. That in turn can lead to a worse experience for everyone, including the people who most rely on these services for their own safety. This is a genuinely hard problem, compounded by the fact that it can affect vulnerable populations with very little room for error. For people with this challenging threat model, education is important: resources like EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense guide can help explain what tools are appropriate. Mullvad + Tailscale Mullvad exit nodes are ready to use starting today, available as a public beta. You can scale your Mullvad use across your family or team for a rate of $5 per month for every 5 devices with access, with recurring automated billing. Mullvad is available as a paid add-on to any current Tailscale plans, including our Free plan. To get started, head over to your general settings tab in the admin console and select Configure.

These are coming together again in this revolution of the wheel of reinvention. Not using \"reinvention\" in any negative way here, this is is good, I think.For history and how some people (John Gilmore[1]) thought uniquitous interoperable VPN tech (using the IETF standardized IPSec) be used to end-to-end secure internet traffic generally, see eg this FreeS&#x2F;WAN rationale from the 90s: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210125023625&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freesw...Then in between then and now were the VPN dark ages where it was mostly only used as a tech to accesss old timey corporate \"internal networks\".[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Gilmore_(activist) reply sam0x17 16 hours agoparentDon&#x27;t forget that historically, a \"half-measure\" a lot of people used to use to get around regional blocking was \"web proxies\" like those linked to by proxy.org. I used to operate one as a young teen and I will say they are a security nightmare -- nothing stopping a web proxy operator from sniffing all user credentials passing through them, and modifying PHPRoxy to do this is trivial.Personally I used to run a domain parking service (back when I was a teen in the early 00s) that used the domains as web proxies and replaced all adsense blocks it could find in the content with my adsense code, and did a 50&#x2F;50 split between my code and the domain owner&#x27;s code. Google eventually became wise to this and banned that sort of thing but it was pretty cool while it lasted, and honestly I think it was super fair considering we didn&#x27;t even add any ad blocks just re-used the existing ones already in the content. reply lxgr 16 hours agorootparentWith practically-ubiquitous HTTPS, these days proxy use is mainly a privacy risk since for HTTPS, they usually can only support transparent byte relaying anyway. reply codetrotter 11 hours agorootparent> for HTTPS, they usually can only support transparent byte relaying anyway.On my LAN I run Squid on a Raspberry Pi, and have my personal laptop configured to use that as a HTTP and HTTPS proxy.All TLS HTTP connections going through the Squid proxy are intercepted.This only requires that my laptop trusts a self-signed TLS certificate that Squid uses.Someone could easily run the same kind of thing on the internet, providing free proxy service and telling their users to trust a certificate signed by them, without properly explaining the consequences of that. And a lot of novice users would likely use that proxy service. Gleefully unaware that even the “encrypted” traffic is completely visible to the proxy.In fact, I would be extremely surprised if there aren’t a whole gazillion of services out there doing exactly that.But in many jurisdictions running a service like that would likely be cybercrime. And even if it wasn’t illegal, it’s still not nice. So, you know, don’t go and actually create a service like that. reply josephcsible 8 hours agorootparent> This only requires that my laptop trusts a self-signed TLS certificate that Squid uses.The word \"only\" is doing a lot of work there. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 5 hours agorootparentNot really. I do the same thing, but I do not use squid. Learning how to operate a localhost proxy is not particularly difficult compared to, say, learning programming languages. The later is a topic people on HN discuss ad nauseum. No one questions when someone lists the computer languages they know and claims they can learn a new language in X minutes or a weekend or whatever.Just because someone does not know how to do something does not mean it is difficult. It just means they did not try to learn how to do it. This is very common comment on HN. It&#x27;s quite silly.Learning how to set up a localhost proxy on a laptop is far easier than learning a programming language. But it is not something that many people on HN want to learn, cf., e.g., programming languages. reply josephcsible 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not talking about how difficult it is to set up a proxy. I meant that getting someone else&#x27;s computer to accept a rogue root CA is a big deal, so saying an attack \"only\" needs that to happen is misleading. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 3 hours agorootparentI guess I misunderstood. reply kelnos 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I&#x27;ve thought about having a CA for my home LAN services, and then have my phone and laptop trust that CA, but I&#x27;m terrified of the possibility that my CA could be compromised, and then someone could intercept my traffic to my bank or whatever.So I just put up with clicking through the TLS cert errors every now and then. reply jauer 7 hours agorootparentI have a CA for home services and was worried about this, so I use name constraints to limit the domains that it is allowed to sign certs for.This blog (not mine) goes into how to do it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systemoverlord.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;private-ca-with-x-509-... reply lxgr 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a neat idea! I looked into name constraints many years ago, and at the time, no common browser or TLS library supported it; glad to see that that has changed.With ubiquitous support, I hope that one day we&#x27;ll be able to routinely get \"subdomain CA certificates\" issued by something like Letsencrypt, just like it&#x27;s already possible to get wildcard certificates. reply briHass 6 hours agorootparentprevA DIY CA is pretty easy to airgap: keep it on hardware that isn&#x27;t your daily driver and only has a minimal&#x2F;secure OS with no network connectivity. Anything you have lying around can do it: like an outdated laptop or SBC.Even just using a VM for the CA would likely be sufficient. Only fire it up for signing, then keep its storage encrypted. I do this on my Proxmox server.This, to me, is worth it for local stuff. The trusted self CA certs are better than blindly trusting an invalid cert, and some browsers require trusted certs to autofills passwords. reply lxgr 6 hours agorootparentprevI used to do the same, but these days, getting TLS certificates for local services is actually not that hard anymore.If you have local DNS, you can e.g. request a wildcard subdomain Letsencrypt certificate and then distribute the corresponding key and certificate to your LAN hosts. reply cdchn 5 hours agorootparentprev>Someone could easily run the same kind of thing on the internet, providing free proxy service and telling their users to trust a certificate signed by them, without properly explaining the consequences of that.Somebody already did do this, except as a paid service, and had their special &#x27;client&#x27; simulate user clicks to install the self-signed root CA cert in your OS&#x27; cert store for you. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 3 hours agorootparentInteresting, it would have to be a pretty invasive client to do that. Usually installing a cert is accompanied by a lot of very loud warnings on modern OSes. So the end user would have to first give this software the permission to click around on their desktop for them without fully understanding the implications. Which does seem plausible reply winternewt 14 hours agorootparentprevSo like a VPN? reply lxgr 12 hours agorootparentNot really. In my view, VPNs (at least the type discussed here) and proxies are complementary:VPNs are good at encrypting&#x2F;redirecting all of your device&#x27;s traffic, since they&#x27;re per-computer by default. They&#x27;re accordingly good at preventing metadata leaks (e.g. visited sites or used apps) on untrusted networks.Proxies are opt-in, but can accordingly be much more fine-grained. For example, Firefox supports per-domain (via various extensions) or per-tab (via the built-in \"containers\" feature) proxies – VPNs usually can&#x27;t do that. reply ignoramous 11 hours agorootparentVPNs can, if they can be routed into via SOCKS or Http Connect gateways, for example. Generally, VPNs (L2&#x2F;L3) can stoop to the level of proxies (L4) but not vice versa (at least not as cleanly). reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentSure, you can bridge in either direction (using e.g. this [1] excellent Wireguard-to-SOCKS adapter), but in my view, if you have bytestream semantics, you&#x27;re often better off using a bytestream-oriented proxying protocol (like SOCKS, SSH or HTTP) and vice versa.These bridges&#x2F;adapters do have their applications though – I have a home router that supports Wireguard natively, but not any of the higher-level protocols; this lets me use my per-tab approach with it.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pufferffish&#x2F;wireproxy reply dizhn 4 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t really get the value proposition of wireproxy. Especially since it seems not to be complete yet.It is trivial to run a socks proxy on one of the peers and have your browser point to that. Both chrome and firefox can do this on demand and for the sites you select. reply calvinmorrison 9 hours agorootparentprevDunno about that. Most work proxies I use just forward the LAN subnet not reroute all traffic. reply lxgr 6 hours agorootparentYes, \"work\" VPNs, site-to-site and many other topologies don&#x27;t change the default route, but \"privacy\" VPNs like Mullvad usually do – there is no group of hosts to route traffic for other than simply \"the entire internet\".That said, I&#x27;m aware of at least one that tries to support an \"exempt&#x2F;excluded hosts\" feature, but it does this via some hack using its local DNS resolver and modifying the routing table on the fly, which does not work reliably. reply josephcsible 8 hours agorootparentprevLucky you. Any companies that have to follow NIST SP 800-171 have to configure their VPNs to reroute all traffic. reply lxgr 6 hours agorootparentInteresting! Is that actually the letter of the specification, or a common&#x2F;industry-standard interpretation? I hate VPN setups like that; it often makes videoconferencing, browsing of non-corp sites etc. unnecessarily slow. reply josephcsible 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the letter of the specification, unfortunately:> 3.13.7 Prevent remote devices from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with organizational systems and communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks (i.e., split tunneling).> DISCUSSION> Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling allows unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. This requirement is implemented in remote devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices, and by preventing configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This requirement is implemented in the system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling.And yep, it does indeed cause all of the problems you describe. replyAdmiralAsshat 13 hours agorootparentprev> nothing stopping a web proxy operator from sniffing all user credentials passing through them, and modifying PHPRoxy to do this is trivialThat&#x27;s why you go through seven proxies. reply barkingcat 10 hours agorootparentno, that&#x27;s why you tunnel through seven proxies, each being used with different sets of credentials&#x2F;encryption keys, all disposable.

The general term \"VPN\" means exactly the same thing now as it did 20 years ago.Virtual means it doesn&#x27;t correspond to a physical network interface. Private means it involves encryption, as opposed to a basic tunnel like ipip or 6in4. And they&#x27;ve always been network interfaces showing up on some node, regardless of whether that node might have been a vendor&#x27;s proprietary black box.Decades ago there were fewer uses&#x2F;topologies, dedicated \"routers\" were more important, and people naively trusted infrastructure.

By your standard, calling that a virtual network is only true in the degenerate sense.I see your point about the possible meaning of \"private\", but I don&#x27;t think that quibbling over the semantics is useful for much besides gatekeeping.

Even if 68 of the links in the network are physical wires and only 2 of them are virtual, their existence changes the character of the whole. In the same way that we have an \"international network\", that would be important to think of and treat as international, even though it only has one cross-border cable. reply mindslight 8 hours agorootparentWhat is the point of just quibbling over definitions? If you were using this framing as in support of a larger idea, it would be plausible to entertain. But without that I don&#x27;t really see much point, because it&#x27;s just as easy to declare things the opposite of your assertion - eg the term \"VPN\" doesn&#x27;t apply to an entire corporate network (as it would per your extension argument), rather just the virtual link part of it.

We did actually make it happen, but it involved consulting with lawyers, comparing the details of the situation against the applicable rules, and getting people to promise to stay within those rules.My guess is that either Tailscale or one of the providers they depend on is cutting off Cubans as an attempt to comply with these Cuba-specific US legal obligations, or at least to reduce their risk of falling into non-compliance.At the very least, GitHub has found ways to legally make most (not all) of their offerings available to Cubans &#x2F; in Cuba despite the sanctions, except for more narrowly banned individuals and groups.

Realistically most of the opposition would come from those who benefit from the status quo (e.g. arms suppliers) and don&#x27;t want to see that de-escalation, and I guess the extremely risk averse who would rather keep kicking the can indefinitely and hoping the blowup doesn&#x27;t come until after they&#x27;re dead, than risk actually trying to help North Korea&#x27;s people. reply ponorin 8 hours agorootparentprevThe vast majority of north koreans only have access to the nationwide intranet.

With HTTPS, traffic is already encrypted, and any DNS-over-HTTPS or TLS provider will also mask where you were headed to, leaving much of the supposed benefits to be mostly snake oil.If, however, you want to use it to access geofenced content, or you employ an obscurity-in-depth strategy to anonymize your identity, then sure, go ham.

If they want you badly enough they can track you anywhere. So, don&#x27;t do anything illegal and expect any VPN to protect you because paid in cash! Remember, all governments have secret national security laws to surveil all data all the time and almost all governments&#x27; (even supposed enemies) secret national security agencies cooperate if they badly want to catch someone.You cannot hide from advertisers if you use a smartphone with apps. App developers who put ads within their app control the apps behavior completely and hence they can fingerprint your device and track you very well without using IP addresses. And within browsers, they can fingerprint you through many javascript features of the browser. Hiding your source IP does very little for your privacy.Almost all traffic (apps and websites) are encrypted via TLS (https, for example). So, even if you are on an insecure network, unless your OS&#x27;s TLS certificate store is compromised, your communications are encrypted and protected against snooping from that insecure network.Also, even on open wifi networks, today, it is very unlikely that the wifi is running without at least WPA2 encryption. Most modern airports run secure wifi. (But they also monitor all traffic metadata for illegal activities).So, using a VPN as an exit node is just privacy theatre. VPN exit nodes in faraway countries are useful for bypassing content censorship in your own country, but it works only if the content streaming service cooperates with you.Remember, all ISPs are heavily regulated by governments and can be asked to mirror specific customer&#x27;s traffic for analysis. I would be very surprised if they don&#x27;t proactively do it for all VPN operator nodes by default. reply whimsicalism 17 hours agorootparent> You cannot hide from governments.Plenty of people have and I would rather they have to spend a Tor 0day amount of cash to do it than to do it trivially.> You cannot hide from advertisers if you use a smartphone with apps.

Learn more OK, got it Updates from Threat Analysis Group (TAG) THREAT ANALYSIS GROUP Active North Korean campaign targeting security researchers Sep 07, 2023 3 min read Google’s Threat Analysis Group shares an update on security researcher targeting by North Korean threat actors. C Clement Lecigne Threat Analysis Group M Maddie Stone Threat Analysis Group Share In January 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) publicly disclosed a campaign from government backed actors in North Korea who used 0-day exploits to target security researchers working on vulnerability research and development. Over the past two and a half years, TAG has continued to track and disrupt campaigns from these actors, finding 0-days and protecting online users. Recently, TAG became aware of a new campaign likely from the same actors based on similarities with the previous campaign. TAG is aware of at least one actively exploited 0-day being used to target security researchers in the past several weeks. The vulnerability has been reported to the affected vendor and is in the process of being patched. While our analysis of this campaign continues, we are providing an early notification of our initial findings to warn the security research community. We hope this post will remind security researchers that they could be targets of government backed attackers and to stay vigilant of security practices. Security researcher targeting Similar to the previous campaign TAG reported on, North Korean threat actors used social media sites like X (formerly Twitter) to build rapport with their targets. In one case, they carried on a months-long conversation, attempting to collaborate with a security researcher on topics of mutual interest. After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once a relationship was developed with a targeted researcher, the threat actors sent a malicious file that contained at least one 0-day in a popular software package. Actor-controlled Twitter profile Upon successful exploitation, the shellcode conducts a series of anti-virtual machine checks and then sends the collected information, along with a screenshot, back to an attacker-controlled command and control domain. The shellcode used in this exploit is constructed in a similar manner to shellcode observed in previous North Korean exploits. The vulnerability has been reported to the affected vendor and is in the process of being patched. Once patched, we will release additional technical details and analysis of the exploits involved in line with our disclosure policies. Potential secondary infection vector In addition to targeting researchers with 0-day exploits, the threat actors also developed a standalone Windows tool that has the stated goal of 'download debugging symbols from Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and Citrix symbol servers for reverse engineers.' The source code for this tool was first published on GitHub on September 30, 2022, with several updates being released since. On the surface, this tool appears to be a useful utility for quickly and easily downloading symbol information from a number of different sources. Symbols provide additional information about a binary that can be helpful when debugging software issues or while conducting vulnerability research. But the tool also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled domain. If you have downloaded or run this tool, TAG recommends taking precautions to ensure your system is in a known clean state, likely requiring a reinstall of the operating system. Github repository for GetSymbol Protecting the community As part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, TAG uses the results of our research to improve the safety and security of Google’s products. Upon discovery, all identified websites and domains are added to Safe Browsing to protect users from further exploitation. TAG also sends all targeted Gmail and Workspace users government-backed attacker alerts notifying them of the activity and encourages potential targets to enable Enhanced Safe Browsing for Chrome and ensure that all devices are updated. We are committed to sharing our findings with the security community to raise awareness, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted by these activities. We hope that improved understanding of tactics and techniques will enhance threat hunting capabilities and lead to stronger user protections across the industry.

I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re referencing. reply 3np 6 hours agorootparentThe normal thing is to have integration test PRs and other CI actions (which may require access tokens to APIs, inherently or due to naive design) be defined by the incoming branch, creating a vector for an attacker to get access to privileged resources.For certain parts of integration and testing jobs that are operating on untrusted code, it&#x27;d therefore be desired to not allow incoming PRs to change certain parts of the CI configuration (not only including .github&#x2F;workflows, which can be protected using branch protection rules, but the testing framework).It&#x27;s possible to achieve this by splitting up your workflows and using workflow_run but it&#x27;s non-obvious and finicky enough that I very rarely see it done.GitHub could make this easier and propose better patterns than they do in their attempt to address the problem[0], which I think could use a 2023 follow-up.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;securitylab.github.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;github-actions-preve...---In this context, an iMessage messagea GitHub PR, I guess. reply MarkSweep 11 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know if I 100% follow or agree with the comparison of iMessage and GitHub actions.

Do we really need a reusable action for disabling a firewall, uploading files, etc.? I mean if it comes from GitHub that&#x27;s fine, but for anything else I would rather verify the solution and copy the code. It works like a low-tech lock file, except changes are always visible inline in Git history, so less chance of lazy programmers missing changes.I almost laughed when GitHub suggested me an Action for Makefile based projects.

Remember that not only security researchers but also developers in general are extra juicy targets because of e.g. their AWS credentials that sometimes aren&#x27;t kept as secure as they need to be. Heck, even if you&#x27;re doing proper SSO with 2FA the tokens can be stolen and data proxied&#x2F;exfiltrated.At best they can be used for coin mining (running up a huge bill), at worst for stealing private customer data (and then selling&#x2F;ransomwaring it). reply dclowd9901 8 hours agorootparentprevWe have pretty high bars for what we allow in terms of outside dependencies, but that doesn’t mean they do.

In one case, they carried on a months-long conversation, attempting to collaborate with a security researcher on topics of mutual interest. After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once a relationship was developed with a targeted researcher, the threat actors sent a malicious file that contained at least one 0-day in a popular software package.In the past, actors would release something, watch it spread, and see what reports back. Sometimes detonation would be limited to certain IP ranges or institution types, but broad deployment would quickly put itself on the radar of security researchers and someone would sound the alarm.I&#x27;m thinking this targeted approach works like doctor-shopping: you find the most paranoid people you can and see if you&#x27;re able to exploit them. If you pull one over on them, then the unsuspecting won&#x27;t stand a chance.

    "originLink": "https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/",
    "originBody": "Skip to content Skip to main content Microsoft Microsoft On the Issues Our Company News and Stories Topics Cloud Principles Press Tools All Microsoft Search Cart Microsoft announces new Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers Sep 7, 2023Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President, Hossein Nowbar, CVP and Chief Legal Officer Share on Facebook (opens new window) Share on LinkedIn (opens new window) Share on Twitter (opens new window) Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are changing the way we work, making customers more efficient while unlocking new levels of creativity. While these transformative tools open doors to new possibilities, they are also raising new questions. Some customers are concerned about the risk of IP infringement claims if they use the output produced by generative AI. This is understandable, given recent public inquiries by authors and artists regarding how their own work is being used in conjunction with AI models and services. To address this customer concern, Microsoft is announcing our new Copilot Copyright Commitment. As customers ask whether they can use Microsoft’s Copilot services and the output they generate without worrying about copyright claims, we are providing a straightforward answer: yes, you can, and if you are challenged on copyright grounds, we will assume responsibility for the potential legal risks involved. This new commitment extends our existing intellectual property indemnity support to commercial Copilot services and builds on our previous AI Customer Commitments. Specifically, if a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement for using Microsoft’s Copilots or the output they generate, we will defend the customer and pay the amount of any adverse judgments or settlements that result from the lawsuit, as long as the customer used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products. You’ll find more details below. Let me start with why we are offering this program: We believe in standing behind our customers when they use our products. We are charging our commercial customers for our Copilots, and if their use creates legal issues, we should make this our problem rather than our customers’ problem. This philosophy is not new: For roughly two decades we’ve defended our customers against patent claims relating to our products, and we’ve steadily expanded this coverage over time. Expanding our defense obligations to cover copyright claims directed at our Copilots is another step along these lines. We are sensitive to the concerns of authors, and we believe that Microsoft rather than our customers should assume the responsibility to address them. Even where existing copyright law is clear, generative AI is raising new public policy issues and shining a light on multiple public goals. We believe the world needs AI to advance the spread of knowledge and help solve major societal challenges. Yet it is critical for authors to retain control of their rights under copyright law and earn a healthy return on their creations. And we should ensure that the content needed to train and ground AI models is not locked up in the hands of one or a few companies in ways that would stifle competition and innovation. We are committed to the hard and sustained efforts that will be needed to take creative and constructive steps to advance all these goals. We have built important guardrails into our Copilots to help respect authors’ copyrights. We have incorporated filters and other technologies that are designed to reduce the likelihood that Copilots return infringing content. These build on and complement our work to protect digital safety, security, and privacy, based on a broad range of guardrails such as classifiers, metaprompts, content filtering, and operational monitoring and abuse detection, including that which potentially infringes third-party content. Our new Copilot Copyright Commitment requires that customers use these technologies, creating incentives for everyone to better respect copyright concerns. More details on our Copilot Copyright Commitment The Copilot Copyright Commitment extends Microsoft’s existing IP indemnification coverage to copyright claims relating to the use of our AI-powered Copilots, including the output they generate, specifically for paid versions of Microsoft commercial Copilot services and Bing Chat Enterprise. This includes Microsoft 365 Copilot that brings generative AI to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more – enabling a user to reason across their data or turn a document into a presentation. It also includes GitHub Copilot, which enables developers to spend less time on rote coding, and more time on creating wholly new and transformative outputs. There are important conditions to this program, recognizing that there are potential ways that our technology could intentionally be misused to generate harmful content. To protect against this, customers must use the content filters and other safety systems built into the product and must not attempt to generate infringing materials, including not providing input to a Copilot service that the customer does not have appropriate rights to use. This new benefit doesn’t change Microsoft’s position that it does not claim any intellectual property rights in the outputs of its Copilot services. We have published more details of the Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers and welcome the opportunity to have further conversations as Copilots become more widely available. Our shared AI journey Today’s announcement is a first step. Like all new technologies, AI raises legal questions that our industry will need to work through with a wide array of stakeholders. This step represents a pledge to our customers that the copyright liability of our products is ours to shoulder, not theirs. Microsoft is bullish on the benefits of AI, but, as with any powerful technology, we’re clear-eyed about the challenges and risks associated with it, including protecting creative works. It is our responsibility to help manage these risks by listening to and working with others in the tech sector, authors and artists and their representatives, government officials, the academic community, and civil society. We look forward to building on such announcements with new initiatives that help ensure that AI advances the spread of knowledge while protecting the rights and needs of creators.

That&#x27;s the only way Microsoft can convince me that they truly believe Copilot is non-infringing technology. reply londons_explore 11 hours agoparentI suspect Microsoft would earn more money by doing this.Their own engineers would get productivity boosts - with copilot already being familiar with data structures, code style, etc. would be a big boost to accuracy.But also, third party code would end up being more similar. Code style of the whole world would be pushed towards &#x27;Microsoft style&#x27;, which probably makes hiring easier, less training time for engineers, etc.And the downside, that is outsiders might learn tiny nuggets of info about microsoft sources, is probably irrelevant when outsiders can already decompile binaries and learn far more. reply chii 4 hours agorootparent> is probably irrelevant when outsiders can already decompile binaries and learn far more.most, if not all microsoft products can have their sources be available for viewing, if you are one of those vip development partners. microsoft doesn&#x27;t really have any secret source (pardon the pun) of which the leaking would undo their value proposition.In fact, if microsft opened up their system a bit more, they might even gain some PR or mindshare, and have no effect on, if not increase, their bottom line. reply zargon 10 hours agorootparentprevIt would be surprising to me if their internal engineers don&#x27;t already have access to a model trained on internal Microsoft code. reply dh2022 11 hours agorootparentprevYou are assuming Microsoft code base is superior to Linux &#x2F; Git &#x2F; MySql &#x2F; whatever else is in github right now.

You probably want to be looking at the quality of the median project, which is going to be heavily influenced by the long tail of low quality projects.IMO, the long tail of non-code-reviewed, written-by-someone-in-their-first-month-of-coding, barely-even-compiles noob code[0] in Github is going to be orders of magnitude larger than the long tail of crap in Microsoft&#x27;s internal repos.[0] Hey, everyone has to start somewhere. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with your first \"hello world\" program being buggy - that&#x27;s what being a beginner means.

This is like saying \"if you truly believe that license agreements are legally binding, then publish your user&#x27;s passwords publically with a license saying no one can use them\" reply klyrs 10 hours agorootparent> This use is found to be illegalThis being the real hurdle.

Where can I read about that court case? reply samch 10 hours agoparentprevI believe you’re referring to GitHub Copilot which is a distinct offering in their portfolio (still Microsoft). GitHub Copilot was based on GPT-3 with fine tuning from public code repositories. That is the controversial aspect of it, I believe.This blog post refers to the broader ecosystem of Microsoft Copilot solutions. Most of those tools rely on the Azure OpenAI API service on the backend and are not specifically tailored for code generation. reply ryukoposting 11 hours agoparentprevThe last thing the world needs is more code written in the style of Win32 API. reply monocasa 8 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s illicit copies of Windows source just up on github. I wonder if we&#x27;re already in the place where copilot will spit those out if you poke it the right way (but I don&#x27;t feel like spending $10 to find out). reply _flux 3 hours agoparentprevWouldn&#x27;t you then end up with code suggestions based on the style guide of a single company and limited set of languages?It probably would not be a very desirable product in the end. reply gareth_untether 12 hours agoparentprevIt would be an ugly beast.

Simply ask copilot to write those functions and see if the code comes out better than a similar set of made up yet plausible function names. reply MikusR 10 hours agoparentprevEven Microsoft knows that their own code is absolute garbage that would bring the quality of copilot way down. reply StewardMcOy 13 hours agoprevAre there any actual details on this? I get that this is a blog post, but the only links I see on the page are to other blog posts. It leaves a lot of questions.Is this blog post a legally enforceable contract? Is Microsoft specifically indemnifying all users of Copilot against claims of copyright infringement that arise from use of Copilot?The blog post says that \"there are important conditions to this program\", and it lists a few, but are those conditions exhaustive, or are there more that the blog post doesn&#x27;t cover? For example, is it only in specific countries, or does it apply to every legal system worldwide?What guarantees do users have that Microsoft won&#x27;t discontinue this program? If Microsoft gets kicked in the teeth repeatedly by courts ruling against them, and they realize that even they can&#x27;t afford to pay out every time Copilot license-launders large chunks of copyrighted code, what means to users have to keep Microsoft to its promises? reply tpmx 10 hours agoparentThis is why (so far) it&#x27;s just PR, not actual legal protection. Brad Smith, being an attorney understands this. Why would he otherwise risk Microsoft (a $2.5T company) with an uncapped liability guarantee? reply Gigachad 9 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s likely MS would want to step in and use their lawyers anyway since the result could be hugely impactful for the future of LLMs which they are heavily invested in. reply politician 11 hours agoparentprev> Is this blog post a legally enforceable contract?It can be. The concept is promissory estoppel.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nolo.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;promissory-estoppel-term.htm... reply gpderetta 11 hours agorootparentIANAL, but far as I understand, estoppel is purely a defense when being sued by whomever made the promise.So it helps if MS sues you when you distribute copilot-generated code that infringes on MS copyrights, but if a third party sues you, you can&#x27;t claim estoppel to compel MS to help you. You would need a contractual guarantee. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s likely that generative AI in general will be deemed fair use, due to its (generally) transformative nature. Sure, if you really coax it, you can get code or images out that look similar to existing ones, but the courts might see that generally speaking, it produces new content that has not been seen before, especially in the case of images.Google Books literally copied and pasted books to add to their online database and that was deemed fair use, so something much more transformative like generative AI will likely fall under much broader consideration for fair use. Google Books was, yes, non-commercial, but the courts generally have the provision that the more transformative something is, the less it needs to adhere to the guidelines laid out for determining such fair use.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ogc.harvard.edu&#x2F;pages&#x2F;copyright-and-fair-use reply dkjaudyeqooe 14 hours agoparent> It&#x27;s likely that generative AI in general will be deemed fair useEverybody seems to be saying this, but I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even 50% chance of it happening.Google books was fair use because it was a public benefit and did not take away from publishers or authors, to the contrary it helped people find their works.Compare generative AI which extracts the essence of people&#x27;s works and recreates similar works (in terms of style, etc) while cutting out the original authors completely. This potentially denies them the fruits of their labor. It&#x27;s notable that it&#x27;s a purely mechanical process and no human creativity is involved, except that which is extracted from other authors. Mere prompts don&#x27;t count.The argument you&#x27;re suggesting will hold is essentially \"yes we&#x27;re using copyrighted works, but we&#x27;re doing it at scale and blending it, so that&#x27;s ok\". reply spott 12 hours agorootparent>extracts the essence of people&#x27;s works and recreates similar works (in terms of style, etc) while cutting out the original authors completely.Only if you ask it to. At which point the person asking is at the very least culpable as well of violating someone&#x27;s IP.It is also illegal for me to pay someone to write Micky Mouse fan fiction (though if I don&#x27;t publish it, this gets more murky).> The argument you&#x27;re suggesting will hold is essentially \"yes we&#x27;re using copyrighted works, but we&#x27;re doing it at scale and blending it, so that&#x27;s ok\".I want to flip this on its head: the argument you are suggesting is essentially \"LLMs should be illegal because they can be asked to break copyright at scale!\" It isn&#x27;t illegal to be an author for hire, even though someone could potentially ask you to write fan fiction for their personal collection in the style of Tolkien, but because an LLM can do it at scale, it is illegal? reply belorn 11 hours agorootparentBoth Napster and the Pirate Bay founders argued that only users could be held responsible, since it was the user who requested the infringing files.

You would be hard pressed to say a significant minority of generative ai has any copyright issues, much less copyright issues as blatant as straight piracy. reply Retric 9 hours agorootparentI’m not convinced any of the output of these generative AI is free from copyright issues. Consider, a ROT13 copy of a book may at first glance look nothing like the original, but distributing digital copies would be clear copyright infringement.Feature extraction is literally a form of lossy compression. You can prod DALEE to make obvious copies of some of the works it was trained on, but even seemingly novel images could contain enough similarities to training material to be problematic. reply spott 7 hours agorootparentI think this is basically the same as the sentiment that there is no such thing as a truly novel idea.The standard isn’t “I think that looks like an Andy Warhol picture”, it is “That is substantially similar to a specific Andy Warhol piece”. Copyright doesn’t protect style.> Feature extraction is literally a form of lossy compression.This is one way think of neural nets, another is that they find the topological space of pictures.But these are just models of computation, which aren’t especially relevant in the same way that it isn’t relevant what produces an infringing image, just that it is produced.Which brings me back to my original point: there are a two different barriers for generative ai: is the model itself transformative, and is the primary purpose of the model to generate copyright infringing material.With respect to the first… I have no idea how someone could argue that the model itself isn’t transformative enough. It isn’t “substantially similar” to any of the works that it is trained on. It might be able to generate things that are “substantially similar”, but the model itself isn’t… it’s just a bunch of numbers and code.Regarding the second: I have less experience with image models, but I use chatgpt regularly without even trying to violate copyright, and I don’t think I’m alone, so I doubt you could make an argument that llms have a primary purpose of committing copyright infringement. reply zarzavat 3 hours agorootparentprevCopyright is not cooties. For something to be infringing it has to be beyond the de minimis threshold. It’s not enough to show that a copyrighted work influenced another work, there needs to be some substantial level of copying.This music industry has been going through exactly this for the last few years and the courts have recognized that the creative process necessarily involves copying and that a small amount of copying is not infringement. reply nickpsecurity 7 hours agorootparentprevThe foundational models most coding models are built on May have comments and code in them.

Any kind of intelligence cannot even simply view or listen to the world without encountering something IP-encumbered.Learning, by human or machine, means extracting a copy of the essence of something and yes, storing that essence in a lossy way.

Because that&#x27;s commonly called inspiration and is how every artist creates their work - through experiencing other works and using that cumulative inspiration to form their own product.Copyright infringement is already ridiculously restrictive as it is, this proposal not only fundamentally misunderstands how generative AI works but penalises AI for doing what humans do everyday. reply Spivak 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah they seem to be applying legal theory like programming code.

A year later, we see that most people, artists included, don&#x27;t use it as a verbatim text to image machine, they use it as a tool. See apps like ComfyUI or others which allow Node based or layer based image creation and editing, which even Photoshop now has.

This could bankrupt Microsoft for offering indemnification to even a tiny company, but as a response Microsoft could instead breach contract and not provide the indemnification. After the company goes bankrupt shareholders could only sue them for for the damages of not indemnifying you, limiting the liability to the size of the company that was sued into oblivion and not expanding out to unlimited liability for MS.They probably have wording to prevent a mandatory injunction where you would compel the indemnification before the bankruptcy. reply CTDOCodebases 12 hours agorootparentThis makes sense.

It&#x27;s a thing that gets argued about all the time in court cases.If I train a model that given the input \"When Mr. Bilbo Baggins\" produces the entirety of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and release it, I have probably infringed copyright.If I train a model that produces some generic paragraphs about \"mountains\" and \"dragons\" but contains no meaningful direct quotes or phrases, then that probably isn&#x27;t a violation on its own. Those words appear in Tolkien&#x27;s works but are not themselves enough to copyright.If to train that model it is demonstrated that I copied Tolkien&#x27;s works in a way not allowed for by the copyright license, (ie buying the book once and copying their text thousands of times across servers to train an AI model) then perhaps I have violated copyright in the interim steps even if the output of my model is no longer consider a copy of the original works.I don&#x27;t think there are black and white answers here. At one point does a chopped up and statisticized copyrighted work become no longer a copyrighted work? Can you train a model on something without first copying that thing in a way that violates copyright law?These are squishy human concepts that get decided by humans in courtrooms and legislative bodies.

I believe (80% confidence) that an independently derived work does not violate copyright, obviously easier to make a convincing case for instances like code or song lyrics where you genuinely expect the implementations to shake out the same from genuinely independent parties.Sidenote, the document that says you cant copy something is the law. The documents I think you are referencing are licenses - the terms under which you are allowed to copy a work.

Why Microsoft would just volunteer for such a risk baffles me.My confusion is more over the balance of revenue and expenses than just \"derp, me no understand why do companies do things to make money, derp\" reply hiq 13 hours agorootparentMany say that `expected revenue > expected expenses (including legal)` given the current regulatory framework, and maybe that&#x27;s true and would explain this move.If Copilot becomes more widespread, it might also force regulators to adopt more friendly regulations that would favor it, lowering the expected legal expenses. So this move by Microsoft might just be the bootstrapping they need to get this dynamic going. reply blibble 9 hours agorootparent> If Copilot becomes more widespread, it might also force regulators to adopt more friendly regulations that would favor itit could easily work the other way too reply thesuperbigfrog 14 hours agorootparentprev>> Even if it gets 1 million subscribers, it would represent 0.1% of Microsoft&#x27;s overall revenue.Microsoft is going all in.

Microsoft engaged with tons of lawyers and legal experts and determined there is basically no risk at all taking this stance.You think there is a very real risk that the AI output is copyright infringement while Microsoft&#x27;s deep analysis says the opposite; that&#x27;s the mismatch. reply hirsin 14 hours agorootparentprevA million subscribers would barely make it noticeable in Microsoft&#x27;s books. You don&#x27;t count until you hit a billion in revenue there. But an AI on every desk ? That&#x27;s worth it. reply RIMR 12 hours agorootparentprevGiven your example of a company unwittingly adding GPL code to their proprietary code base, I have trouble seeing how Microsoft can offer to take liability for such an infringement.The GPL requires that any software based off of it be GPL licensed and have public sources available. I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where Microsoft pays a fine, and their customer gets to violate the GPL license by not removing the infringing code, or open-sourcing their product as GPL and providing sources to the public.Enforcement of the GPL can&#x27;t just involve paying a monetary settlement to get away with stealing open source code. It must involve the direct targeting of infringing software with demands that the software either take efforts to remove illegally borrowed code, or license the borrowed code as legally prescribed by the original license agreement.That an AI got in the way of reading the license agreement should not be an excuse for doing zero due diligence in maintaining a lawful code base. reply esafak 15 hours agoparentprevThey can shoulder risks that other companies can&#x27;t so they stand to capture more market share? reply dndn1 11 hours agorootparent+1Maybe they hope to kill new entrants for the enterprise market, including open source. reply tboyd47 15 hours agorootparentprevThere is no market yet for a product that is unprecedented in nature. reply skywhopper 15 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;re having trouble getting enterprise customers to sign up for Copilot because of uncertainty over copyright implications of generated code. So they are attempting to remove the uncertainty by claiming they will hold themselves responsible. They are betting that this will allow them to win more Copilot customers. Ultimately, Microsoft has every incentive to ensure that Copilot-generated code is legally allowed; in other words, they will want to make sure any cases that come up related to Copilot code are ruled in their favor. As such they may as well be the ones paying the legal bills. That encourages more customers to sign up and aligns incentives across the board. reply treprinum 11 hours agoprevAre they going to threaten all small devs with patents when they object to having their code in the copilot almost verbatim? reply Havoc 11 hours agoprevWhich is essentially open ended liability...so their lawyers must be very darn sure there isn&#x27;t much risk. reply littlestymaar 14 hours agoprevI wonder how binding this kind of public commitment is.

Find someones IP, split the gains. reply coding123 13 hours agoprevAnother way to look at this is:Microsoft just became a code copyright insurance company.

That side is probably not Microsoft. reply bobobob420 15 hours agoprevCopyright related stuff is annoying. I cant see why any one would care. If you publish something to the public domain I dont understand why you get rights to your content that you can self declare. Its completely ludicrous and only works at the corporate money level because they have liability and resources to sue. I wish people would use a little more common sense and understand the words ‘public domain’. Regardless of what people say, I can let you know that no one really cares about copyright and in terms of AI, its an unmovable mountain. Good luck wasting time on figuring out an issue that provides nothing to humanity reply heavyset_go 16 hours agoprevYou can now launder GPL code with the confidence that Microsoft&#x27;s world class legal team will have your back if you&#x27;re sued for it. reply CameronNemo 16 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t know why it is just GPL people talk about. MPL, Apache, MIT licenses all have additional terms beyond a basic public domain equivalent license. None of those terms are being respected. reply adastra22 15 hours agorootparentCompliance with MIT&#x2F;X11 license just requires distributing the license file with the binary. If you infringe, it is trivial and costless to correct.Copyleft licenses are more troublesome for those who would rather not release source code. GPL is being used as a stand-in for all copyleft licenses. reply CameronNemo 15 hours agorootparentIt is not costless to correct if you don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s code was an input in the first place. reply wtallis 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s intractable to preemptively avoid all possible copyright claims, but correcting them after being called out on it only requires adding the license and attribution required by whoever&#x27;s currently suing you. reply frognumber 15 hours agorootparentprevYes... and no...Courts -- under common law jurisdictions -- don&#x27;t interpret contracts and licenses literally. If you stick within the spirit of a license or contract, you might be okay (even if you break the letter), and vice-versa.Beyond that, it&#x27;s a question of damages and consequences. Omitting a warranty disclaimer isn&#x27;t likely to result in a lot of damages.And finally, there are odds of getting sued. If you infringe on my AGPL code, I&#x27;ll be pissed. I used that license for a reason. On the other hand, I &#x2F;hope&#x2F; my MIT-licensed code is reused in commercial products. If you infringe on some term, I probably won&#x27;t care.There&#x27;s a lot more nuance than that, starting with statutory law jurisdictions like France to things like statutory damages, and I&#x27;m intentionally oversimplifying.However, from a 10,000 foot view infringing on the GPL versus on an MIT license are very different beasts, and there&#x27;s good reason to be a lot more worried about the former. reply CameronNemo 14 hours agorootparentA warranty disclaimer is important, and there can certainly be damages argued.Also important is attribution. reply heavyset_go 16 hours agorootparentprevI agree with your point, I&#x27;m just using the GPL as an example of a license people tend to know the stipulations of. reply eyelidlessness 16 hours agorootparentprevNot OP and I don’t really comment on the topic much at all, but one reason I would expect more talk about GPL than those permissive licenses: I would also expect a greater likelihood of murky infringement cases becoming a legal matter. Just a hunch, possibly a very wrong one, mostly informed by how I’d evaluate choosing among these licenses. reply hyperman1 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you upload it to github, you give microsoft extra rights above the license you choose. I&#x27;m not sure they are bound by the license. reply bobthecowboy 12 hours agorootparentThis is nonsense. The uploader is not necessarily the copyright holder of the code. The uploader is not necessarily in a position to grant extra rights above the actual license.What happens if someone else uploads my code to github?What happens if proprietary code is uploaded to github?What happens if national secrets are posted to github?In all of those cases, the person doing the upload does not \"own\" the content, nor did they choose the license.There is no reasonable read of a ToS agreement that would allow Microsoft&#x2F;Github extra rights to that content. reply WCSTombs 15 hours agorootparentprevThose \"extra rights\" would need to be spelled out in the terms of service, and last I checked, they were basically just making sure GitHub had the legal right to host your code on the GitHub service. It did not include any provision to create and distribute derivative works outside the license included with the software being hosted. reply hyperman1 13 hours agorootparentI readhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;github-terms&#x2F;github-t...Chapter D4 gives microsoft the right to: parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our serversI don&#x27;t know what a real court says, but I can imagine a lawyer saying training an AI is done by analyzing your code.Chapter D5 gives almost anybody right to do a lot with your code, including creating derived works, as long as it happens on github. If the AI training happens on their servers, I think you agreed to them training an AI.Not saying they are doing it right now based on that document. But I do assume a lawyer has enough material to make the waters really muddy, and a trial being decide by basically a dice roll. reply layer8 16 hours agoparentprevOne can only hope that this will work better than their software support.I wonder how customers will have to prove that the contested code was actually output by Copilot. reply adverbly 15 hours agoparentprevObviously it wouldn&#x27;t be so straightforward.Microsoft would have access to your usage history, and would be able to easily prove your intended theft as a user if any of your prompts or usage history made it clear that you were attempting to subvert a license.If anything, this temporarily shifts the battleground out of the courts and into prompt engineering space.It would need to look like an accident for a bad actor to pull this off. reply itsoktocry 15 hours agorootparent>would be able to easily provePossible, perhaps.

That sounds pretty tricky. reply paxys 15 hours agoparentprevGood. Screw companies trying to assert copyright over 10 line functions that reverse a string. reply bdowling 13 hours agorootparentThose kind of functions are arguably not even eligible for copyright protection because they contain no human expression of the kind that is usually protectable (e.g., creative writings, artistic works). reply circuit10 15 hours agoparentprevThis only applies if you use the filters they have that prevent code from being copied directly, so that shouldn’t be likely to happen reply jojo100 6 hours agoparentprevGood. reply gjsman-1000 16 hours agoparentprevThis is the same website that rejoiced when Oracle v Google resulted in a Google victory, despite Google arguably doing similar.

I don&#x27;t think a regurgitation of 12 lines of GPL code by accident here and there will be a strong argument against fair use.Adding to that: How many people here actually abide by the StackOverflow contribution license of CC-BY-SA when copying and pasting code from there? ;) reply Scaevolus 16 hours agorootparent11,000 lines of _declaring_ code-- the API signatures. reply jiofj 15 hours agorootparentThe API signatures were arguably the only thing that mattered. reply bdowling 12 hours agorootparentThe API signatures were arguably the only part that was copyrightable.Code that is purely utilitarian (see “useful articles doctrine”) isn’t a work of human expression that is copyrightable. reply seanhandley 15 hours agorootparentprevDefining the “what” is just as much a part of the intellectual property as defining the “how”. Both things are hard to do well IMHO reply wtallis 15 hours agorootparent> Both things are hard to do well IMHOThat&#x27;s not really a factor in determining what&#x27;s eligible for copyright protection. reply flatline 15 hours agorootparentprevI do think this is relevant to the conversation.I don’t copy&#x2F;paste code from SO but there is sometimes inevitable duplication because sometimes there is only one right way to do something! Copyright can stray into the case of the ridiculous pretty quickly.Is an interface declaration inherently different from, say, a merge sort implementation? It’s all code. But they also serve very different purposes. I do not think prior to Google v Oracle there was much case law to distinguish between different types of code, but in the industry we recognize all kinds of nuance. reply hollerith 15 hours agorootparentprev>How many people here actually abide by the StackOverflow contribution license of CC-BY-SA when copying and pasting code from there?I always thought that code snippets that small are not considered by the Courts to be eligible for &#x27;copyright protection&#x27;. reply organsnyder 15 hours agorootparentI always include a comment with the SO URL (though I haven&#x27;t copied any code from SO in quite some time—it&#x27;s not nearly as useful as it used to be). reply gjsman-1000 15 hours agorootparentprevIn that case, is Copilot regurgitating 25 or so lines of GPL code, less than 1% of the time, eligible for copyright protection? reply CameronNemo 15 hours agorootparentWhy do you think it would only be 25 lines? reply gjsman-1000 15 hours agorootparentBecause that is about, so far, the longest piece of clearly, demonstrably unique code that has ever been shown to have been copied.

Note Not to mention Rich-CLI, Trogon, and Frogmouth Today we are adding one project more to that lineup: textual-web. Textual Web takes a Textual-powered TUI and turns it in to a web application. Here's a video of that in action: With the textual-web command you can publish any Textual app on the web, making it available to anyone you send the URL to. This works without creating a socket server on your machine, so you won't have to configure firewalls and ports to share your applications. We're excited about the possibilities here. Textual web apps are fast to spin up and tear down, and they can run just about anywhere that has an outgoing internet connection. They can be built by a single developer without any experience with a traditional web stack. All you need is proficiency in Python and a little time to read our lovely docs. Future releases will expose more of the Web platform APIs to Textual apps, such as notifications and file system access. We plan to do this in a way that allows the same (Python) code to drive those features. For instance, a Textual app might save a file to disk in a terminal, but offer to download it in the browser. Also in the pipeline is PWA support, so you can build terminal apps, web apps, and desktop apps with a single codebase. Textual Web is currently in a public beta. Join our Discord server if you would like to help us test, or if you have any questions.

Once you start going down the path of animations, layout, fonts, etc, you start just reinventing the web - but with extra steps.Personally I would cut complex animations (i.e. sub-character) and only have a single size monospace font. I would rip out CSS and go for maximum compatibility. (If something exists like that, please let me know!)Another feature that could be cool is to have this served (optionally) via telnet. I would also make it be able to produce static content (with a subset of features). reply snthpy 18 minutes agoparentI like the telnet idea. I haven&#x27;t used that in like 20 years. Do people still use that?I guess it&#x27;s kinda like running over ssh? Or do you mean you hit an open unprotected port (telnet) and then the app takes care of setting up the SSL connection so you don&#x27;t have to worry about SSH details? reply nine_k 17 hours agoparentprevYou can&#x27;t cut of all the CSS; you likely want to honor things like `display: none`, and also colors, and preferably bold, italic, and underline. reply c0balt 10 hours agorootparentTbh this can all be covered by ANSI escape codes. They aren&#x27;t very expressive or compasable, in comparison to CSS but adequate for most TUI programms. And even the DX around them is okay-ish in textual and other TUI frameworks. reply eterps 19 hours agoprevI prefer TUIs over GUIs primarily because TUIs are often tailored for advanced users — essentially, for professionals. In contrast, the majority of GUIs prioritize user-friendly experiences for the general consumer.When a &#x27;TUI&#x27; begins to incorporate features like mouse-clickable buttons, drop-down menus, scrollbars, windowed interfaces (as opposed to panes & separate screens), it gradually shifts away from its core identity. Eventually, it becomes a GUI operating within the limitations of a terminal.Imagine something like lazygit with text-drawn buttons, drop downs and other TUI anti-patterns. Or even more extreme, without its keybindings and modality. It would miss the point entirely. reply willm 18 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think the two use cases are mutually exclusive. You can have that keyboard driven muscle-memory workflow, while keeping things discoverable for users who haven&#x27;t committed everything to memory. reply chinchilla2020 16 hours agorootparentAutoCAD is a great example of something that gives both options.New users tend to get really involved with the buttons, but gradually shift to full text control over years.Obviously in CAD sometimes you cannot enter coordinates and must grab the mouse... but it&#x27;s still faster if you minimize use of the mouse. reply eterps 18 hours agorootparentprevDo you have examples where this is the case? In my experience, they&#x27;ve always seemed mutually exclusive. reply verdverm 18 hours agorootparentthe TUI library for tcell has mouse support, though you see it more in tview (or one of the dozens of maintained forks)I&#x27;ve already experimented with dropdown menus and minimizing sections. While I too love the TUI and keyboard driven experience, many want something they can click on, less overhead from every application having their own hotkeys. For me, it&#x27;s about reaching more people, and the hope that I can bring more of them into the mouseless development experience reply eterps 18 hours agorootparent> many want something they can click on [...] it&#x27;s about reaching more peopleTo me, these reasons underscore the need for a genuine GUI, rather than a TUI that requires users to open a terminal just to have something clickable. reply nine_k 17 hours agorootparentMany TUI programs, e.g. Midnight Commander, can use mouse, but are perfectly operable with just a keyboard. Same with Emacs or Vim in terminal mode.This is more about blending in among GUI tools, which is also important. reply eterps 16 hours agorootparent> This is more about blending in among GUI tools, which is also important.This is what I find difficult to understand, why is that important?

I could have run Emacs in TUI mode, but I appreciate variable font support in non-code texts I write. reply makapuf 15 hours agorootparentFor the videochat client it could be one video window with several panes (PIP, main+side small, ...) with a textual interface for controls, chatting etc. reply verdverm 18 hours agorootparentprevyeah, I&#x27;ve consigned myself to needing a GUI, but for the time being, iteration with a TUI is much faster. Our focus is also CUE, where working from the Go API unlocks way more possibilities. We get to keep the extra complexity of representing CUE constructs as JSON for sending on the wire. Though that GUI might be native and avoid all the web stuff anyway. reply adamckay 16 hours agorootparentprevtmux. I know the keyboard shortcuts (that I customised) to create new windows and panes, and the shortcut to resize them all equally.

You can argue in practice there exist a lot of unproductive GUI that&#x27;s worse than a TUI client, but I think it&#x27;s the problem of the designer, not the tool.Also there are some areas that&#x27;s universally acknowledged to be better suited for GUI, anything that requires visualization like video editing, image editing, 3d modeling, etc. Maybe someone can go full ffmpeg to edit a feature length film, but that&#x27;ll take some effort. reply msla 15 hours agorootparent> In theory GUI is a superset of TUIOnly if the TUI is non-scriptable. That&#x27;s the big bait-and-switch possible here: Is it a TUI in that the menu system is made out of text, or is it a TUI in that it&#x27;s a command line with a scripting language and the ability to create new commands out of composable pieces?

No bikeshedding over border widths or radii when it&#x27;s just you picking among a few characters for the shape. just having less decisions to make speeds things up and helps you focus on what you actually want the UI to be able to do.Obviously if your app is just calling APIs anyway, that might be negate some of these bullets about no additional services to babysit etc. In this case, it was running an internal infra app that directly connected to a pg db.And what made me pick it over just having a CLI:* discoverability - it was a complicated app and while it was all technically exposed via cli flags, having a GUI made it a lot easier to figure out what the right incantation is.* richer communication medium that&#x27;s back-and-forth instead of unidirectional. The TUI is able to fetch a list of e.g. valid IDs and let you pick them with a check-list, instead of you having to go query the db yourself and type them in.I consider it one of my greatest victories that my boss was able to use the TUI to recover from an incident without needing to page me while I was on holiday, and he said he barely had to read the docs and felt confident he was getting it right the first time. \"I did it while sipping my coffee.\"I used https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mabe02&#x2F;lanterna - would recommend.

Command-driven operation is how I tell a good UI from a poor UI. Good interfaces are intuitive for beginners and provide a smooth learning curve to mastery. Good way to get there is for the interface to remain simple and consistent on the surface, but unravel more specialized power as you dig in, and ultimately allow full customization.It&#x27;s all the things that make macOS UI so good IMHO: apps look and work similarly at the surface, have consistent keyboard shortcuts, you get excellent feature discoverability through the top bar menu + search box, and you can even rebind any menu item to a custom shortcut (both per-app and system-wide) through the stock Settings app. Pitch that against your typical selection of TUI apps: vi, less, top, screen, tmux, irssi, mutt, etc all do things differently, the *only* thing they have in common is a grid of character cells.Terminal emulators themselves unfortunately seem to be the anti-thesis of good UI. The ecosystem is highly fragmented. Writing a TUI app from scratch (yes I wrote my own TUI text editor) is hell, if you want to aim at more than the lowest common denominator, while ensuring portability (I&#x27;m talking just Linux+BSD+Mac; I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to start with Windows). Even if you chose not to waste your life and started with Termbox or heck even ncurses, you&#x27;ll still be fighting a dragon at the end of every dungeon level: keybindings (why can&#x27;t I do ctrl+shift+a!?), colors (crap it ended up being black on black!), etc.> From elsewhere on the site, it seems like they&#x27;re trying to target people who would like to write GUIs, but find writing GUIs too hard, and that the TUI part is just a starting point.I haven&#x27;t looked at the framework yet (TL;DR...), but that seems like a goal that I could get behind. Writing a good GUI app nowadays means you have to learn and use platform-specific APIs, and cross-compiling is a massive pain.Beeware (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beeware.org&#x2F;) is working on something pretty good in that direction.

And when we add PWA support, they will have a more desktop look and feel.SSH is an advantage when running in the terminal.

It allows non-web developers to build bespoke apps.I also think that TUIs can be more attractive than GUIs in some scenarios.

Perhaps browsing and filtering the list of packages -- though the specific workflow isn&#x27;t important for this example. In that case, homebrew can ship a CLI that handes most or all workflows, plus one or more TUI workflows to enhance some subset of those workflows.

    "originBody": "Engine Mojo🔥 Blog Keynote Careers Company Contact Sales Login Sign Up BLOG / PRODUCT Mojo🔥 - It’s finally here! September 7, 2023 Pramod Ramarao AI Product Manager Since our launch of the Mojo programming language on May 2nd, more than 120K+ developers have signed up to use the Mojo Playground and 19K+ developers actively discuss Mojo on Discord and GitHub. Today, we’re excited to announce the next big step in Mojo’s evolution: Mojo is now available for local download – beginning with Linux systems, and adding Mac and Windows in coming releases. While the Mojo Playground provides an easy hosted introduction to the language, the local Mojo toolchain empowers developers to accomplish much more. Local developer tools provide access to the full power of Mojo, including a full set of compiler features and IDE tools that make it easy to build and iterate on Mojo applications. In this blog post, we’ll take a high-level tour of what’s inside the Mojo SDK. First, let’s quickly review what Mojo is and how it can benefit you. Mojo: a high performance 'Python++' language for compute Mojo is a new programming language for AI developers that will grow into being a superset of Python over time. It already supports integrating with arbitrary Python code seamlessly and has a scalable programming model to target performance-critical systems, including accelerators (e.g. GPUs) that are pervasive in AI. Mojo meets you where you are today, and enables you to progressively adopt new features to enable high performance where you need it. Mojo combines the best of dynamic and static languages together, and can achieve up to 68,000x the performance of Python today. You can read more about Mojo’s origin story in our docs, but let’s recap a few important benefits that Mojo unlocks for users: Write everything in one language: Mojo meets AI developers where they are, combining the usability of Python with the systems programming features that cause developers to have to reach for C, C++, or CUDA. Your research and deployment teams can now work in a common codebase, streamlining the research to production workflow. Unlock Python performance: Python is pervasive, but not the right tool for tasks that require high performance or exotic hardware. Mojo enables high performance on CPUs, as well as support for exotic accelerators like GPUs and ASICs, providing performance on par with C++ and CUDA. Access the entire Python ecosystem: Mojo provides full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, making it seamless to use the Python libraries while taking advantage of Mojo’s features and performance benefits. For example, you can seamlessly intermix NumPy and Matplotlib with your Mojo code. Upgrade your AI workloads: Mojo integrates tightly with the Modular AI Engine, empowering you to easily extend your AI workloads with custom operations, including pre-processing, post-processing operations and high-performance mathematical algorithms. You can integrate kernel fusion, graph rewrites, shape functions, and more. As we’ve shown in past blog posts, with simple code changes to existing Python code, you can get significant (>68000x) speedups with Mojo for compute-bound workloads. If you are a Python programmer, check out this blog post for an easy introduction to performance optimizations with Mojo. Mojo is now available for download to your computer, but Mojo is a lot more than a compiler. The Mojo Toolbox The first release of the Mojo SDK comes with everything you need to easily develop Mojo programs. This includes the following tools: mojo driver: provides a shell (for read-eval-print-loop or REPL), and allows you to build and run Mojo programs, package Mojo modules (including support for the 🔥 extension!), generate docs, and format code Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code): supports various productivity features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and more Jupyter kernel: supports building and running Mojo notebooks, including Python code Debugging support (coming soon): step into and inspect running Mojo programs, even intermixing C++ and Mojo stack frames This initial release of the SDK supports X86/Linux systems, and we will expand to additional operating systems, hardware, and tool features in upcoming updates. A view of the Mojo SDK Now, let’s take a look at each of the tools available in the current release of the SDK. Mojo Driver Just as with Python, you can start programming in a REPL by running the mojo command. Here is an example that calculates Euclidean distance in Mojo from our previous blog post: $ mojo Welcome to Mojo! 🔥 Expressions are delimited by a blank line. Type `:mojo help` for further assistance. 1> %%python 2. import numpy as np 3. n = 10000000 4. anp = np.random.rand(n) 5. bnp = np.random.rand(n) 6> from tensor import Tensor 7. let n: Int = 10000000 8. var a = Tensor[DType.float64](n) 9. var b = Tensor[DType.float64](n) 10. for i in range(n): 11. a[i] = anp[i].to_float64() 12. b[i] = bnp[i].to_float64() 13> from math import sqrt 14. def mojo_naive_dist(a: Tensor[DType.float64], b: Tensor[DType.float64]) -> Float64: 15. var s: Float64 = 0.0 16. n = a.num_elements() 17. for i in range(n): 18. dist = a[i] - b[i] 19. s += dist*dist 20. return sqrt(s) 23> fn mojo_fn_dist(a: Tensor[DType.float64], b: Tensor[DType.float64]) -> Float64: 24. var s: Float64 = 0.0 25. let n = a.num_elements() 26. for i in range(n): 27. let dist = a[i] - b[i] 28. s += dist*dist 29. return sqrt(s) 30. 31> let naive_dist = mojo_naive_dist(a, b) 32. let fn_dist = mojo_fn_dist(a, b) 33. print(fn_dist) 34. 1290.8521425092235 35. print(naive_dist) 36. 1290.8521425092235 What’s more, Mojo allows you to build statically-compiled executables that you can deploy without any dependencies. For example, you can compile and run the hello.🔥 program from our examples repository as follows: $ mojo build hello.🔥 $ ./hello Hello Mojo 🔥! 9 6 3 $ ls -lGtranh hello* -rw-r--r-- 1 0 817 Sep 3 23:59 hello.🔥 -rwxr-xr-x 1 0 22K Sep 3 23:59 hello A 22 kB statically-compiled binary is pretty cool, and is made possible by Mojo’s tight dependency management. Visual Studio Code Extension Visual Studio Code is one of the most popular IDEs in the world, and Mojo supports it directly with an official extension on the Visual Studio Marketplace. This provides Mojo support for a number of developer productivity features: Syntax Highlighting Diagnostics and Fixits Definitions and References Hover help Formatting Code Completion Mojo example in Visual Studio Code with syntax highlighting Visual Studio Code showing code completion; the left screenshot shows available modules and types. The right shows the available functions for the “Int” struct. The language server and extension verifies Mojo code and displays errors and warnings inline: Left screenshot shows an error with a suggested fix; the right screenshot shows that the “TensorShape” data type has not been imported into the program and thus has no declaration. The extension also supports hover help, showing embedded doc strings for API quick reference: Visual Studio Code extension shows the API documentation for “parallelize” We will share more about the feature set in a future blog post. If you have any feedback or you like the extension, please leave a review! Jupyter Integration Jupyter provides a powerful environment for interactive development. Mojo includes a Jupyter kernel so you can get started right away with Jupyter notebooks. We’ve also shared all the notebooks from the Mojo Playground here on GitHub (see the README for details). Running a Mojo notebook with Jupyter and Visual Studio Code Debugging Support (coming soon) In an upcoming release, we’ll add an interactive debugging experience that works in Visual Studio Code and via the LLDB command line interface. Not only that, Mojo’s debugger is able to seamlessly debug hybrid Mojo/C/C++ code in the same debug session, empowering developers even further when working with highly specialized code. A debugging session of a Mojo program in Visual Studio Code The Amazing Mojo Community ❤🔥 We are thrilled about the creative and passionate developers that are getting in on the ground floor of Mojo development to build exciting things and we hope that the Mojo SDK makes this easier, collaborative and more fun. Some examples we’ve seen include: Blogger Maxim Zaks has implemented multiple tree data structures in Mojo and published a blog post and some preliminary benchmarks GitHub user MadAlex1997 built an N-Dimensional Array Implementation in Mojo If you’re building something in Mojo, please join one of our communities (below) and share what you're working on. It's a great time to blog about your experiences and share projects. More to come! 🚀 The first release of Mojo is now available for local development. We are eager for you to try it out and share your feedback. But this is just the beginning – we are continuing to drive language improvements, and will start open sourcing parts of Mojo later this year.

That&#x27;s the only announcement I care about reply kunwon1 13 hours agoparentTheir FAQ says this: Over time we expect to open-source core parts of Mojo, such as the standard library. However, Mojo is still young, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until more of its internal architecture is fleshed out. We don’t have an established plan for open-sourcing yet.I read this as:\"There are parts of Mojo that we are not planning to open source\"Which makes this a non-starter for me as well reply ActivePattern 13 hours agorootparentI believe that Chris Lattner (Mojo lead) has said that its going to be open-source eventually. He&#x27;s followed the same process as with Swift, where they did&#x27;t open it up until major design decisions had been worked out with the core team. reply derbOac 11 hours agorootparentI can see why they might wait to open-source things, but I guess part of what gives me pause is the \"parts of Mojo\" statement, as in \"we expect to open-source core parts of Mojo.\" Not \"we expect to open-source Mojo\", but \"parts of Mojo\". reply nxobject 11 hours agorootparentYeah – I&#x27;ll wait to see how that spins out. I&#x27;m under the impression that they&#x27;re making their $$$ from AI tooling, so I&#x27;m sure there will be some \"secret sauce\" optimisation tools that&#x27;ll be held back from public release. reply WanderPanda 8 hours agorootparentIn my understand the sauce they want to sell is the multiprocessing&#x2F;cluster management software that builds on top of Mojo. If they do it like that it would be fair game imo reply jackclayton 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is true, he talked about this recently in a livestream: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mQh9es5gfpoDisclaimer: I work for Modular reply vorticalbox 12 hours agorootparentThen why not just be open source from the start?What benefits does one get from starting off closed and transitioning to open source? reply umvi 11 hours agorootparentMaybe you don&#x27;t want the peanut gallery commenting&#x2F;complaining&#x2F;whatever about your architecture until you are ready (otherwise architect astronauts could inundate your comm channels with suggestions, comments, PRs, etc) replyetra0 15 hours agoparentprevSame, and even worse, the playground requires you to be logged in. That&#x27;s like the initial step of a demo and requiring an account is simply nuts. reply uoaei 14 hours agorootparentThe same is true of GPT. Just sayin.Actually GPT is worse because they demand both a phone number and an email. Still haven&#x27;t signed up because of that nonsense. reply debugnik 14 hours agorootparentLLM inference takes up some scarce GPU time and many people are trying to use free entrypoints to build services instead of the intended paid APIs, so I understand why those services want to put limits on usage.Programming playgrounds however are freely available for pretty much every mildly popular language, and these days many toolchains can even be compiled and run with JS or WASM so one could just serve some static files to host it. This is definitely more suspicious than what OpenAI and other ML companies are doing. reply version_five 12 hours agorootparentprevThere is no parallel. If meta required you to be logged in to run local inference with llama, that might be similar. Your using openai&#x27;s cloud so you&#x27;re logged in. reply archargelod 14 hours agorootparentprevI can understand why openai requires phone number. With how much resources they spend on each prompt, they want to limit abuse of their systems. Also ChatGpt is not available in many countries and a phone number is reliable enough test of location. I am myself in one of these countries, but I also care about my privacy, so I use services that use chatGPT indirectly instead: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;you.com with disposable email and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.com reply uoaei 12 hours agorootparentGiven the iris-cataloguing efforts of Altman&#x27;s Worldcoin, and Microsoft&#x27;s intrusive telemetry-surveillance, I would doubt that&#x27;s the only reason.I appreciate you offering an alternative that preserves a small measure of privacy. reply takeda 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use GPT. reply bsder 10 hours agoparentprevI agree. And I&#x27;m in the same boat about JAI.No open source--no attention.Otherwise, you get stuff like the \"Our Machinery\" fiasco: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;gameenginedevs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;wd3o33&#x2F;deve... reply dang 14 hours agoprevRelated.

It’s a closed source product by a for profit companyIt would be nice if it were open source, but I don’t see anything that’s unclear about the IP. reply wraptile 2 hours agorootparentMojo team is avoiding this topic like a plague. I recently listened to whole Lex Fridman episode with Mojo&#x27;s founder Chris Lattner [1] and I don&#x27;t think they said a word about licensing. I still don&#x27;t get it tbh.I don&#x27;t even understand how can Mojo be compared to Python without reflecting on Python Software Foundation which is arguably the main reason Python is such a wild success. We should do more PSF not less.1 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lexfridman.com&#x2F;chris-lattner-3 reply ayhanfuat 13 hours agorootparentprevHow license will evolve is unclear. I personally don&#x27;t mind it starting closed to figure out a contribution model or whatever they want to sort out as long as they have clear commitment. However, the current statement for open source is so vague that I don&#x27;t want to invest time on it. reply code_biologist 9 hours agorootparentI think not investing time in Mojo is the currently the correct decision. If Modular decides they have a good product and would like broad community adoption, they will make the open source and licensing decisions that would support that. They&#x27;re smart and I presume aware of that dynamic, so honestly I suspect they don&#x27;t want a broad community just yet.Community management and language feature haggling is not worth the expense at an early for-profit company with an alpha language that needs to solve internal problems. reply mort96 3 hours agorootparentprevGood. It&#x27;s an early alpha product. You shouldn&#x27;t invest time into it. If their current licensing model prevents people from using it from anything serious, that sounds like a win. reply ayhanfuat 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a programming language. Just playing around to see what it is capable of means serious time investment. I wasn&#x27;t planning on using it on production. Anyway, that was a feedback for the creators. I&#x27;ll check back if they change the license. reply WanderPanda 8 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t the whole point that you don’t invest time in it but just switch over your python project and then optimize it in a ship of theseus manner? reply danielvaughn 14 hours agoparentprevYeah I believe the actual quoted figure was \"35,000 times faster than Python\". It&#x27;s a silly metric either way. reply version_five 12 hours agorootparentI have never taken them seriously precisely because of this statement. They are a machine learning specific language and everyone who works in machine learning knows the speedup is cherry picked bullshit. If they&#x27;re basing their marketing around an obviously false claim, why would I take a closer look? reply pavelstoev 6 hours agorootparentThe claim is likely not false just like a horse pulling a buggy is several orders of magnitude faster than a snail. reply ayhanfuat 13 hours agorootparentprevThey have recently published a blog series which started with 35,000x and ended with 68,000x [1]. The thing is anyone familiar with performance sensitive code is not looking at Python vs the other thing. They are looking for whether or not it is in the ballpark of C, Julia, Cython, Numba, etc. Those are the contenders, not Python.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modular.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speed... reply ActivePattern 13 hours agorootparentI think the reason that they focus on pure Python is because a big use case would be pure Python code bases that can be incrementally ported over to Mojo for better performance, without needing to totally abandon the Python language and ecosystem. reply luma 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you read the description, they started with 35,000x, then tripled the number of cores to get 68,000x. If your triple the cores and wind up with less than twice the performance, your scaling isn&#x27;t very good. reply fooker 11 hours agorootparentIt is very good, especially if you don&#x27;t have to rewrite your code.Try to do it yourself (say take a merge sort implementation and try to make it scale), it&#x27;ll be roughly this much after a few hours of work.Now imagine the compiler is doing this for you. reply DiffProg 10 hours agorootparentKeyword is imagine, because with Mojo you do have to write your code in a new language. You cannot use the Python parts if you want speed. That&#x27;s writing code in a new language. reply fooker 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the stated goal, it&#x27;s not mature technology.You can have your python parts source compatible with the new language.Of course they are far off from that.But not that far off if your python code is typical ML framework consumer code. reply vorticalbox 12 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the task not all tasks scales linearly replysamuell 14 hours agoprevHmm, a bit of a rough experience.I had a few lines of python code, to count the fraction of A:s and C:s in a DNA (fasta) file adapted from [1]: with open(\"chry_multiplied.fa\") as infile: a: int = 0 t: int = 0 g: int = 0 c: int = 0 for line in infile: if line[0] != &#x27;>&#x27; and len(line) != line.count(\"N\") + 1: g += line.count(\"G\") c += line.count(\"C\") a += line.count(\"A\") t += line.count(\"T\") total_base_count = a + t + c + g gc_count = g + c gc_fraction = float(gc_count) &#x2F; total_base_count print( gc_fraction * 100 )Result: $ mojo run gc.mojo gc.mojo:1:6: error: use of unknown declaration &#x27;open&#x27; with open(\"chry_multiplied.fa\") as infile: ...\"open\" must be one of the most used Python functions ... :&#x2F;[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samuell&#x2F;gccontent-benchmark reply mathisfun123 11 hours agoparentman two days ago when i said their promise of compatibility with python was startup hype i got no traction. like duh they&#x27;ll over-promise and underdeliver - it&#x27;s chapter 1 of every single SV playbook. reply qaq 9 hours agorootparentHave you looked at the team?

I apologize. I try to avoid on HN and in general.Faster, yes, but at what cost?I&#x27;m so impressed by the Python community, but I&#x27;ll never quite understand why they gravitated to... Python itself. It&#x27;s unbelievable to me that in Mojo&#x27;s case some of the brightest, most famous engineers have gathered to do incredible computer science work to improve the compute performance of a language that is fundamentally flawed in its performance characteristics for those very applications. It just seems like such a waste.How on earth did we arrive at this moment?Chris Lattner is right in his Lex interview: he had to accept that the community was already committed to Python and given that reality, that in turn pre-filtered his available paths. But my god, what if the community had gravitated to a better language [for these purposes] in the first place? How much further along would we be in our tooling and capabilities to deliver value?Chris, who I admire, loves to talk about language design decisions; loves to talk about how thoughtful they were in the decision-making around Swift; and then in the next breath says, hey whitespace-based scoping doesn&#x27;t matter, don&#x27;t worry about these things. Chris all you do is worry about these things, and worry about them for Mojo. He clearly has opinions that he masks about design choices Python has made; otherwise, after all, why the need to make Mojo?It just seems like at the end of the day, Mojo may be the most technologically advanced lipstick ever to be placed on a pig.(Edit for grammar, but clearly not for brevity or conciseness. XD) reply chrislattner 13 hours agoparentHey, thanks for your interest. I think it&#x27;s interesting that you think I don&#x27;t care about things like whitespace vs braces? In the Lex interview I was kidding around, but I assure you, I do care.Braces are strictly worse than whitespace indentation for several reasons. Brace-based languages:1) Generally have the \"dangling else\" set of ambiguities. 2) Some (e.g. C) allow but do not require braces which leads to style debates. The ones that require braces are more verbose. 3) Require more punctuation clutter, and consume more vertical whitespace in practice. 4) ... use braces that are completely redundant with indentation in practice!It&#x27;s super funny to see people defend curly based languages. Using curlies but not indenting properly is almost always a sign of a bug (e.g. clang has warnings for this sort of thing due to the \"goto fail\" and other debacles.That said, as you also know, Python compat is not optional for us, so Mojo doesn&#x27;t actually a choice at all here. I find it amusing though that your post acknowledges thoughtfulness in language design and thinks this is an example of a lapse of judgement. :P-Chris reply alpaca128 12 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s super funny to see people defend curly based languages.Well, that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re not really \"strictly worse\" in every way. I find curly braces helpful for readability and cursor navigation. The latter is only possible with Python by completely parsing the code. Also I don&#x27;t like reading vertically dense code, so having (almost) empty lines inbetween is fine. All subjective of course, but that&#x27;s the case for every aspect of language syntax.> Using curlies but not indenting properly is almost always a sign of a bugI don&#x27;t think anyone criticising Python&#x27;s syntax cares about the freedom to have inconsistent indentation, that&#x27;s not the point. reply mrcwinn 9 hours agorootparentprevChris,Ha! I love your reply. Thank you.I know you care about language design. As I said more or less, that&#x27;s self-evident, and I&#x27;m sorry for taking your whitespace comments too literally. You&#x27;re the source, after all, not me, so accept my apologies there. It&#x27;s misinterpretation, but not meant to be a misrepresentation. :-)My comment wasn&#x27;t meant to be critical of you. Honestly, as a pretty famous engineer, it never even crossed my mind you might read my message. As I said, I know you have to deal with reality to accomplish your goal, and that reality existed before you showed up to take on the challenge.Thank you for all your contributions and good luck on Mojo.Chris reply saagarjha 12 hours agorootparentprevCurly braces are very helpful during development, because you can scope code without having to reindent it. It&#x27;s quite similar to being able to comment out a block of code, which Python happens to also make somewhat frustrating. reply mrbungie 14 hours agoparentprev> But my god, what if the community had gravitated to a better language [for these purposes] in the first place?

There are a lot of external factors for something being popular, like timing, luck, support from big enterprises and leading colleges, inertia and sunk costs.

It&#x27;s more than how popular it was when it launched, many of those languages that are allegedly better had a strong timing disadvantage by either not existing or not being mature once the data science boom occurred (including equivalents to libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib and theano), allowing python to be the right option then. Any language that missed the timing must now play catch up with a fraction of the resources and completely unproven in the market.Luck is harder to quantify, but at the very least competitors like common lisp didn&#x27;t have much of it. reply sundarurfriend 1 hour agorootparentprevAlso, Python is where the \"Rust Evangelism Strike Force\" type stuff really started being a massive phenomenon.Language wars have been forever, of course.

I understand not going OSS right now if there&#x27;s still a lot of churn expected, but I think that can be worked around:1. Just because something is OSS doesn&#x27;t mean the public is entitled to defining the roadmap or design decisions. If you set working norms up front and make it clear who has decision-making power and why, people will decide for themselves if they want to engage or not. A lot of frustration in OSS comes from lack of clear boundaries around how and why something evolves the way it does.2. You can meet in the middle and be source-open. Don&#x27;t use an OSI license, don&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll look at a community contribution, and don&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll engage on a particular issue. People can still benefit from seeing the source and deciding on if it&#x27;s the right tool for them.I know a lot of folks rag on \"corporate controlled OSS\", but there&#x27;s a lot of examples of that motion working really well for products.

In addition to what you mentioned:* try catch is different keywords from virtually all other languages.* walrus tusks, the general order in list comprehensions generally where bindings come after expression* typing is awful, unsound in a lot of cases, there’s a ton of special non straightforward plugins in mypy. This is partially better in pyright but not considerably.* package management is silly. Poetry is like a poor imitation of npm.

When inside a method, module, class, or do...end block definition (read: most of the time), you&#x27;re able to use the rescue keyword solo. Anything raising an exception in the method above the rescue keyword will be caught.It can also be used postfixed to a statement that might raise an exception.Ruby is oddball here because it&#x27;s subtly different. def a_method @value = dangerous_method_call rescue \"default value in case of exception\" do_something_else @value rescue puts \"an error, oh no\" end reply robertlagrant 13 hours agorootparentprevPython is try&#x2F;except, not try&#x2F;catch.

This is my biggest issue with Python.2. Are there any tolerable solutions you&#x27;ve found?3. Are there any non-Python languages you&#x27;d recommend?The root of Python&#x27;s typing issues seems to be ad-hoc syntax recycling as a stand-in for a thoroughly planned type system. Understandably, Guido and others advise using Protocol types to make up for earlier design decisions. It sort of works, but:1. It&#x27;s effectively an unspoken deprecation for parts of the standard library2. Current design choices create new problems3. It still doesn&#x27;t reliably prevent runtime errorsThings break down further as you move beyond the built-ins:1. Pydantic and other tools come with their own problems2. Ugly things happen at boundary lines in APIs (ctypes vs OOP)3. All of these get even worse as Sphinx gets involvedThe last two items came up in a recent PR discussion. The other commenter&#x27;s point seemed correct: simple, specific, and rigid types prevent problems. But then why should we have Generic and Union at all?I&#x27;m still going to use Python when necessary, but it makes the grass look very green near languages like OCaml and Elm. If Rider can make .NET&#x27;s packaging tolerable, maybe F# would be good too. Are there any others you&#x27;d suggest? reply bookmark1231 15 hours agoparentprevI concede about multi line lambdas but far too many languages take a “syntax is bikeshedding and unimportant” approach to language design. New languages are still using “&&” and “||” as if it’s 1975 and syntax highlighting doesn’t exist. Looking at C++, Rust and even Zig code is unnecessarily complicated for someone who isn’t intimately familiar with the syntax meanwhile for the most part anyone can understand Python syntax (well, at least Python syntax that doesn’t abuse decorators and obscure dunder overloads) reply Shikadi 14 hours agorootparentI personally find && and || easier to read than \"and\" and \"or\" because instead of using words to separate words, it&#x27;s symbols separating words. Sure syntax highlighting helps, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an objective choice here reply alpaca128 12 hours agorootparentprev> New languages are still using “&&” and “||” as if it’s 1975Because it&#x27;s consistent and people don&#x27;t want to relearn minor details each time they switch. And Python has a lot of those little differences. Though the \"and\" and \"or\" keywords are among the few things I actually like.> meanwhile for the most part anyone can understand Python syntaxWhat matters more to me is how the syntax works in the long term. I have no trouble reading and writing a lot of Rust code, but even after years with Python I still can&#x27;t remember the difference between \"[-1:]\", \"[1:]\", \"[:1]\" etc for slicing lists&#x2F;strings. Recursive list comprehensions with their lack of parentheses are unreadable to me to this day (e.g.: `[item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist]`). Python is very easy and quick to pick up, really productive for prototyping, but I don&#x27;t consider its syntax to be its big advantage. reply lambda_garden 14 hours agorootparentprevThe issues I raised were pretty concrete, and not merely \"this symbol is better than that symbol\" reply kstrauser 15 hours agoparentprevThrowing this out there:- I’ve used nonlocal 0 times ever.- I get that people miss them, but you can define nested functions if you want. Nameless functions are nifty, but I’ve never lost sleep over putting `def foo` in front of what would’ve been a lambda in other languages.- I kinda like the Python ternaries.Preferences are A-OK, and I’m not saying you’re wrong. Just chiming in that the things you mention aren’t universally disliked. reply chombier 14 hours agorootparent> I’ve used nonlocal 0 times ever.Same here, but I got bitten by weird scoping rules quite a few times.Separating variable definition from assignment (e.g. with &#x27;let&#x27;) would probably help a lot in this case. reply rvrs 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d like to add that forced whitespace is infuriating. It&#x27;s annoying to navigate (in vim I can&#x27;t easily go to the beginning&#x2F;end of a code block like I can in languages where scopes are defined by braces), and it&#x27;s annoying to read because it&#x27;s not always intuitive how deep I am within nested scopes reply frodowtf 14 hours agorootparent> ... it&#x27;s not intuitive how deep I am within nested scopesThe ONLY piece of information that is available to you regardless of how deep you are into a function is INDENTATION. Your curly braces won&#x27;t help you.Besides that, you should seriously reconsider your coding style if this is an actual problem for you. reply rvrs 14 hours agorootparent>The ONLY piece of information that is available to you regardless of how deep you are into a function is INDENTATION....No? It sounds like you write very long, messy code blocks. Consider the following example, I will write a nested loop in 2 languages:In Python: for _ in range(10): for _ in range(10): print(\"Inner\") print(\"Outer\")Here&#x27;s something similar in JS: for (const _ of foo) { for (const _ of foo) { console.log(\"Inner\"); } console.log(\"Outer\"); }In isolation, while I&#x27;m writing this comment, I would say these code blocks are equally easy to parse. In the context of frantically debugging, scurrying around a file, I may (and have!) missed the indentation difference in the Python example.Curly braces allow me to have 3 visual indicators that a block is finished: a visual text object (the brace itself), an extra line separator (the closing brace lives on its own line), and indentation. In Python, I only have one of those things (just indentation). I can have 2 (indentation + line sparation) if I always insert a newline before `print(\"Outer\")`, but empty lines can get deleted and I may forget to include them as I write code. You&#x27;d need to configure a linter to guarantee the line separation indicator in a language that delimits scopes by whitespace. reply takeda 3 hours agorootparent> witter pulled the same trick earlier this year where they made For You the only option, then they would show For You each time you open the app, then they finally gave the Following feed back.Obviously. You&#x27;re using 2 spaces indentation for Python and 4 for JS. Don&#x27;t be surprised that it is harder to see the indentation.I think I might have indentation related bug early on, when I was new to Python, but I don&#x27;t remember any recently. It could be that Python 2 allowed to mix tabs and spaces for indentation, while this is no longer allowed in 3.Also this is how I would format the code: for _ in range(10): for _ in range(10): print(\"Inner\") print(\"Outer\") reply kstrauser 14 hours agorootparentprevThat’s an issue with your vim setup. You can absolutely navigate Python code in vim. reply rvrs 14 hours agorootparentGot any recommendations?Also, I didn&#x27;t say it was impossible to navigate, but it is cumbersome and annoying.

It’s very compute intensive and there’s value in making it faster. There’s also a lot money sloshing around for doing AI stuff.

For example you can&#x27;t do `foo = (yield a).b` you have to do `x = yield a; foo = x.b`.Having a special syntax for the expression version of if else is another example as you said.I was disappointed to discover Dart made the same mistake there. There&#x27;s a totally different syntax for match statements and match expressions. Why?? Ok maybe backwards compatibility.. but still.

That&#x27;s the tough part. reply r00fus 12 hours agorootparentTo my understanding if 50% (a majority) of the employees signs up (ie, union cards) for the union prior to any vote, if the employer takes a union-busting act, the union is automatically legitimized and the employer must negotiate with them.Most major corporations are all already doing union-deterrence (not illegal) as operating practice so they likely won&#x27;t see an impact unless there is a black swan event that causes workforce and management to come to loggerheads. reply toomuchtodo 10 hours agorootparentYour understanding is correct. replymrguyorama 15 hours agorootparentprevThat looks like a lot of marketing to me trying to shore up Biden&#x27;s reputation with Union workers after he killed the railroad strike and left our necessary workers to the dogs. reply dabraham1248 14 hours agorootparentFrom the _IBEW_ ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibew.org&#x2F;media-center&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;23Daily&#x2F;2306&#x2F;2306... ):> “We’re thankful that the Biden administration played the long game on sick days and stuck with us for months after Congress imposed our updated national agreement,” Russo said. “Without making a big show of it, Joe Biden and members of his administration in the Transportation and Labor departments have been working continuously to get guaranteed paid sick days for all railroad workers. reply nxobject 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s amazing – it&#x27;s strange that I never noticed that.

You need to say that what you care about is long term, but that&#x27;s now how we&#x27;re compensated (read: incentivised). Plus you&#x27;re not there to see it anyways so there are really very little incentives to think long term.[1] some googling but couldn&#x27;t find a great source for this. Though it matches what I&#x27;ve observed in the industry. reply mjhay 17 hours agorootparentYeah that is a good point. Short-term thinking and short tenures are incentivized. The short average tenure in tech is just crazy to me, considering that onboarding takes forever compared to most industries, and how expensive the hiring process itself is. Nonetheless, companies hate giving existing employees raises despite how much it helps retention. reply kwhitefoot 14 hours agorootparent> onboarding takes forever compared to most industries,What? If you mean other industries where people are called engineers is used then I&#x27;m pretty sure that getting up to speed in another industry and becoming familiar with the unspoken, unwritten, unconscious rules that make the product possible must take at least as long as in any kind of software based company. Not to mention that there are often lots of constraints regarding what may and may not be done with hardware exposed to the public. reply jumpman500 16 hours agorootparentprevWell another way to think about it is that onboarding new folks is the only way to really check if your following a sane software development practice.If it takes folks more than a few months to onboard, you probably have too many rules, standards or other processes that are pointless. There a multiple exceptions but if you can’t onboard folks fast your management team is either incompetent or they don’t pay developers enough to care who learns. reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentprev> The median tenure in tech is one to two years before moving on to another team or company [1].Note that individuals who switch jobs often inherently will figure in a higher number of tenures that you’re taking the median of here. This means the majority of software engineers will actually have a longer tenure. reply eckza 16 hours agorootparentJobs Georg, who has changed jobs 10,000 times in the last three years, is an outlier and should not have been counted. reply philipov 17 hours agorootparentprevSo what we should be looking at is the median number of tenures, not the median length of tenures? How would one weight the latter by the former to get a more robust measure of tenure length? reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentWell, what do you want to ascertain? In any case you won’t capture the long tail of long tenures, because you don’t know how long current tenures will extend into the future. What you could measure is the median current seniority of tech employees (how long they are in their current job), which would be a lower bound for the median of (eventual) tenures of current employments. reply twic 16 hours agorootparentprevDepends how you sample. If you look at all current employees, and ask how long they were in their previous job, i don&#x27;t think it does. reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentThat will also skew towards shorter tenures, (a) because shorter tenures tend to occur earlier in a career rather than later (so a previous tenure is more likely to have been shorter), and (b) when you’re sampling at a random point within a career, you’re more likely to hit a long tenure within that career, which conversely means that the previous tenure (or more generally, any of the past or future tenures) will more likely be shorter than the current one in that career. reply vips7L 17 hours agorootparentprevIt does not match what I’ve observed in the industry. reply morkalork 16 hours agorootparentAlso kind of insane. 1-2 years? In any large codebase or platform, it takes a year to become familiar with and touch a decent portion of it. Also, talk about never having to live with the concequences of decisions you&#x27;ve made in terms of long term support and maintenance. But I guess these are all rockstar developers doing the hopping around so that&#x27;s not really their concern is it. reply Apocryphon 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s usually closer to 2 years than to 1. reply wyclif 10 hours agorootparentI would say it&#x27;s better to do 2-3 years early on as a young employee. Older, more experienced tech people tend to have longer tenures as they gain years of experience. reply KptMarchewa 16 hours agorootparentprev1-2 years for first few years in the industry, possibly a decade. Older employees tend to stay much, much longer. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparent>Older employees tend to stay much, much longer.A lot of things probably going on there.- Personal&#x2F;family situation probably favors stability over mobility- May already make pretty good comp so jumping for something better is less incentivized- Value is more in making connections and using internal networks than banging out code, biasing towards longer term. reply makeitdouble 8 hours agorootparentprevThe one~two year turnover is usually for employees that can easily come and go. Key individual contributors for instance often stay for far longer, forgoing more lucrative options to keep working on an environment that fits them.Losing people in these positions will hurt a lot more than the average engineer&#x2F;sales moving on after a short stint. reply bsder 9 hours agorootparentprev> The median tenure in tech is one to two years before moving on to another team or company [1].Mostly only true in Silly Valley.In non-tech hubs, the tenures tend to be longer. reply derekdahmer 17 hours agoparentprevThey did pay severance.> The West Hollywood, California-based company also gave a severance package to staff who were unable to relocate, in what the CWA alleged was an attempt “to silence workers from speaking out about their working conditions,” according to a statement from the organization. reply darth_avocado 15 hours agorootparentThey’d have to pay more if they have to layoff people (WARN related expenses).

MBA types may have earned a reputation of being distinctly out of touch with the \"factory floor\" and the end user, but their actions are often rational if viewed through sufficiently Excel-tinted glasses. To me, the RTO push does not seem rational in that way.I fully admit that this is a half-baked hypothesis based mostly on vibes, but I suspect that a lot of execs operate more than they&#x27;d admit on \"ape brain\" concerns of social dominance, and feel threatened by the prospect of not having underlings in a contiguous physical territory. Part of what makes the cubicle (never mind the open layout) such a cultural touchstone for corporate soullessness is that the physical space you inhabit distinctly belongs to the company; it is not \"your\" space. Conversely, WFH takes that space from the company and gives it to the worker, at least metaphorically. Perhaps this is even the post-postmodern, meta-ironic, lazy-teenager version of \"seizing the means of production\", although I&#x27;ll leave that argument to people who have actually studied the likes of Gramsci, Adorno and Deleuze. reply paxys 11 hours agorootparentI agree. If a company asked its team of MBAs to figure out the ideal work situation, they&#x27;d run the numbers and conclude that saving on expensive office space, expanding the talent pool, being able to hire in cheaper regions, keeping employees happier and reducing attrition etc. made remote work the more favorable option.

I was familiar with RTO since my employer is doing it by gradually increasing required # days in the office.But not everyone will know what it is . reply Phelinofist 15 hours agorootparentA few weeks ago our CEO decided that we should be at least one day per month in the office (my commute is 2h over all by car). They say it is not mandatory and will not be enforced. Also, everyone can select the day that fits them the best, so not everyone will be at the office at the same day. When asked about the reasons for this, since we did pretty well during covid when everyone moved to HO, they gave the following reasons:- People have to identify with the company more. When asked about the details of that they complained that a lot of people just log in, work on their issues and log off. So basically doing what they are paid for. I answered that this is not a bad thing, which was not well received.- People need to socialize more. According to them everyone needs to be more friendly with their peers. I think that I am friendly to my peers and direct reports, but I admit that not everyone can do that level of socializing online. OTOH I will not be able to socialize as well in person. Also, while I&#x27;m generally friendly I never join events for exactly that reason.- Silos between different departments. According to them there is bad blood between some departments and they hope to resolve this if everyone get to know each other better. I can&#x27;t really confirm this, as all my interactions with different departments always go well. However, since there is no mandated day I can&#x27;t understand how this will tear down the silos.- Onboarding of new colleagues is considered hard&#x2F;not as successful as it should be. Again, in can&#x27;t confirm this as three people joined my team in March and they are doing pretty damn solid.- According to them, before covid when everyone was in the office things were better. I asked them how many employees there were at that time: 50. Currently we are ~160. IMHO it is kinda obvious that communication and peership is better with 50 than with 160 people and office presence will not improve this.- According to them, meetings and workshops are better in person. I can&#x27;t really agree on that as I feel that since moving to HO, meetings have been way better and a lot more productive.Some other things to consider: from 7 people in my team 3 are located in India, so they will not be able to come to the office anyway. Also we have two office locations in Germany, so we will not be able to everyone anyway. Also some people have 100% HO contracts and they will not come to the office since they live a few hundred km from each location -> kinda unfair IMHO.I think all their reasons are frankly pretty bullshit and coming to the office will not improve any of those. As the situation will not improve by this I expect them to go up with the days in the office since \"we need to do more to improve things!11\".I&#x27;m not so happy about this. reply yieldcrv 14 hours agorootparentyeah once I realized everyone at my company shows up on different days of the week I stopped comingI’m in the office once or twice a month now, usually for some team lunch or something. reply toomuchtodo 17 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;pLUy9 reply monksy 17 hours agoparentIs it just me or are other people being denied archive&#x2F;cloudfront pages due to the CDN capacha?Every time I complete the CAPTCHA it doesnt&#x27;t leave that page. reply throaway920181 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m guessing someone severely broke their site.

The article you cite misdescribes the situation (for ideological reasons that are old hat to anyone familiar with the history of socialism). The railroads didn&#x27;t argue that they should be able to spend zero money and make all the profits. They argued that they were paying money: they were paying employees fairly and adequately for their efforts. And having done that, they, as the owners of the company, took the profits that were left after meeting all company expenses, including paying labor fairly and adequately for its efforts. That&#x27;s literally what owning a company means. An employee is not an owner. Profits are what the owners get after paying their employees.A much better argument against the railroads in this case is that the railroad routes that their companies have exclusive rights to are granted by government regulation, not in a free market, so the revenues that are available to them, and which determine what their profits are after paying their employees, are not due to their sound business acumen, but to their ability to buy government regulations that favor them. But the article you cite does not say that (again, for well known ideological reasons). reply activitypea 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not familiar with the situation, but this \"refutation\" sounds bleaker than the original claim reply pdonis 14 hours agorootparentThe situation is basically that railroad workers asked the Biden administration to weigh in to improve the terms of the latest contract that the railroad company management was offering them, and the Biden administration told them tough luck. Which is indeed a bleak situation. But misdescribing it as \"railroad company management wants to pay zero money and take all the profits\" does not help; it makes it worse because it makes the workers sound unreasonable since the claim is obviously false. (Btw, I&#x27;m not saying the actual railroad workers are making that claim. Only the post I originally responded to was.)The fact that railroad service in the US sucks is also bleak, and is a product of the same government regulation that has put the railroad company workers in the bleak position they are in. If you don&#x27;t like the obvious implication of my previous post, which is that the government should open up railroads to free market competition and force the railroad company management to either show actual business acumen or give up their profits to someone who can, there is another possible response: since the government has created a railroad monopoly, the government should grant ownership of the railroad companies to all railroad workers, not just the company management. That way all workers would naturally share in the profits, because they all have a share in ownership. That would actually be more in line with what \"socialism\" claims to be about: everyone gets a share in the ownership of the capital they use to produce value. But the article that was cited doesn&#x27;t make that argument either (once more, for ideological reasons that are obvious to anyone who is familiar with the history of socialism). reply eli_gottlieb 14 hours agorootparentprevAs Cory Doctorow put it: capitalists hate capitalism, and each and every one of them wants to become a rentier. reply throaway920181 17 hours agoparentprevThat phrasing is obnoxious.

They might buy some solutions, but build others.eBay also doesn&#x27;t magically become an auction house, just because they decide to buy a platform, rather than develop one.

And at various levels of scale, they all grow from purely running on an Office license to some custom spreadsheet logic to an in-house database server. reply mrweasel 16 hours agorootparentI understood it as the company has to write the software in-house. The steel mill bought the software, so not a software company by that definition. reply LeifCarrotson 15 hours agorootparentThe steel mill wrote the software, they&#x27;ve got a couple guys writing C# for an ASP.NET app that runs their custom CRM and pushes orders, CAD files around, keeping the workload consistent so that you don&#x27;t end up with a bunch of parts in a row that all need the largest gantry crane at the same time, ensuring that patterns cut in-house are ready on time, making sure that the shop knows what color paint goes on each part, and so on. And that&#x27;s not even getting to the custom automation software that runs on their PLCs and so on.Sure, in that specific example they only have about 5 out of a couple hundred employees who can write C#, and maybe 10 who can program PLCs, plus some contractors like myself. But your definition of \"software company\" was effectively \"dependent on custom software to operate\", and that&#x27;s been true of every single one of hundreds of automotive&#x2F;furniture&#x2F;aerospace&#x2F;heavy industrial manufacturing plants that I&#x27;ve been in throughout the past 10 years. reply yjftsjthsd-h 14 hours agorootparent> The steel mill wrote the software, they&#x27;ve got a couple guys writing C# for an ASP.NET app that runs their custom CRM and pushes orders, CAD files around, keeping the workload consistent so that you don&#x27;t end up with a bunch of parts in a row that all need the largest gantry crane at the same time, ensuring that patterns cut in-house are ready on time, making sure that the shop knows what color paint goes on each part, and so on.

The Grindr app seems much closer to the \"built with generic open source lego blocks\" side of the spectrum, no? Maybe it is not so clear-cut and drastic, as they probably also have a lot of custom tech - e.g. matchmaking &#x2F; trust&safety algos? - and Adobe IS using lots of OSS building blocks as well, I expect. But still, I do think there&#x27;s a difference.But going back to the first part - I appreciate your implicit point, but most any company is best served by thinking about itself first and foremost as an [its function] company. So yes, Adobe IS an artist tool company more so than &#x2F; before it is a \"tech company\".If the companies that dominated the artist tool market before computers had had the good sense to think of themselves in this flexible, adaptable, big-picture way (instead of as paint-chemtech companies or whatevs) there&#x27;s every chance one or more of them would have the $$$ that has instead gone to Adobe. They already had the customer & vendor relationships, the brand awareness, etc - i.e., the hard parts.If you are a poker player, it&#x27;s likely that it currently makes sense for you to play NLHE almost exclusively.
