    "hn_content": "Non.io, a new Reddit-like platform with a simple interaction model of paid subscriptions is launched. Users must pay a minimum subscription of $2 per month, but will be able to interact by upvoting posts, and the pooled sum from the ad-free platform will be split equally between all the upvoted content. Free accounts are available, and users are requested to try test accounts before paying. However, potential issues raised range from the landing page design and user interface to questions over whether payment-based models like this encourage meaningful engagement or clickbaity behaviour. Nevertheless, the new platform has the potential to compete with social networking giants like Reddit.A discussion about how to incentivize high-quality comments on a new social media platform similar to Reddit. Some suggest personalized content ranking based on user upvotes, while others propose using cryptocurrency or a point system to reward quality content creators. One user warns against paying users for upvotes, as this may incentivize quantity over quality. Others suggest using a referral system or early adopter rewards to build momentum. User interface design is also discussed as an important factor in gaining and retaining users. The importance of network effects in building a successful social media platform is acknowledged, but some argue that the platform's capabilities and unique features are also crucial elements in driving user growth.A new online community platform is garnering interest due to its monetization model of paying users for popular posts in real money. However, the platform needs to improve its mobile usability and homepage to attract more users. Moderation will be crucial as incentivizing users with real money presents a challenge to prevent low-quality posts from saturating the site. Some users have suggested ways to encourage moderation and manage quid pro quo influences, such as limiting user interactions per day and having two types of upvotes\u2014one for fake internet points and another for paying upvotes. The platform\u2019s competitor, Reddit, is becoming more aggressive with monetization, potentially explaining the interest in the new platform.A discussion thread on Hacker News suggests paying moderators on a Reddit-like platform via a commission or revenue-sharing model. The idea is to incentivize moderation and prevent abuse of the system by those who only care about making quick money. However, concerns are raised about quality control and potential tax implications for users. Other suggestions include meta-moderation, allowing users to subscribe to specific moderators, and donating earnings to charity. The original poster, Non.io, is considering various options, including adding a withdrawal threshold and limiting the creation of new sub-forums. Non.io aims to create a platform where user interest, rather than shareholder demands, drives development priorities. The conversation also touches upon the potential for subscription-based revenue models versus traditional advertising models.The Tech Times reports on a discussion surrounding the creation of a new platform like Reddit that rewards users monetarily. Users would be able to pay $5/month to contribute to a pool of funds which posters would then be paid out of based on the popularity of their posts. Some believe that paying users could lead to a more conscientious approach to upvoting and thus incentivize quality content, while others express concerns about potential gaming of the system or monetization of other people's content. However, the idea of rewarding posters with real money instead of fake internet points demonstrates a new way of approaching user-generated content platforms.",
    "hn_summary": "- Non.io is a new Reddit-like platform that requires users to pay a minimum of $2 per month, but offers upvoting that will be split equally with other upvoted content.\n- Discussions on incentivizing high-quality content and moderation are ongoing as Non.io offers monetary rewards for popular posts.\n- The platform needs improvement on mobile usability and homepage design while competing with Reddit for monetizing its platform."

    "hn_content": "Reddit's decision to force mobile browser users into their mobile app is being criticized for putting the company's interests over users, as apps give companies more control and allow for tracking and telemetry. In-app browsers can be injected with\u00a0javascript, which can be used for tracking or other purposes. Users also cannot block ads or prevent tracking without the help of the platform vendor. However, Reddit likely made the move to attract more users to their app, as it's believed that users in-app tend to spend more than those using the mobile web. It's unknown whether users can tell the difference between in-app browsers and regular browsers when they open links. ReVanced offers pre-patched APK files for the official Reddit app that remove ads.ReVanced is a community-driven collection of patches for popular Android apps. The ReVanced Manager is a patching framework that includes patch management software. Developers can track the association between multiple accounts, which helps sell users' browsing history. Users can install the new version of a patched app under a new name. Users can block ads on Android 11 with the OpenDNS ad-blocking server. HTTPS makes network connections between an app and the backend opaque, but HTTPS alone does not hide the domain visible for routing. Use Adguard for blocking ads inside apps. The apps are blob-based, whereas the web apps use HTML elements and are user-agent-introspectable. F-Droid is an entire alternative app store that accepts open-source, user-centric apps.The post features a discussion on why companies push for users to download their mobile apps. Some suggest it is to increase revenue, advertising revenue, push notifications, and to gather more data for analytics. Others argue companies incentivize app downloads to make it harder for users to switch to competitors. However, many users dislike these tactics and prefer mobile browsers or shortcuts. Overall, the post highlights the various motivations and reasons behind the push for mobile app downloads.Reddit's move towards a more app-centric user experience is likely driven by a desire to increase engagement, collect more user data, control the user experience, bypass ad-blockers, and push notifications as the most significant retention lever. The shift towards native apps can offer more ways of gathering user data opaquely, which is of value to finance people. Third-party apps also mean higher CPM, which equates to more advertising-driven revenue. Push notifications encourage re-engagement, and native apps put users in the mindset of using your service by default and exclusively. While some users find the enforced-app strategy annoying, it may increase the likelihood of users paying for the platform. The mobile app is Reddit's top of the funnel entry point, while push notifications are the single biggest retention lever. Third-party apps could also help to increase user stickiness.Users discuss their experiences with using Yelp and Reddit, including frustrations with pop-up ads and redesigns. Some users have switched to using alternative versions like old.reddit.com. There is speculation that tech companies don't care about the preferences of a minority of users and prioritize profits. Some users recommend using extensions or alternative apps like ReVanced to improve the user experience. Overall, the thread discusses the frustrations and annoyances of using certain tech platforms and the ways users have found to cope or switch.",

    "hn_content": "Social media platform, Reddit, appears to be experiencing an outage with users being met with error messages, sparking speculation on Twitter about the cause of the issue. The large number of closed private subs and the system\u2019s handling of them seems the most likely cause of the outage. Though it is not yet clear what specific infrastructure problem caused the issue, it is suggested that a part of the system that usually doesn't get a lot of requests wasn't designed to handle a huge influx of requests. Reddit is operating a skeleton crew due to COVID-19, so finding the relevant engineering staff to deal with the issue may present an added challenge. 93% of subreddits are now private due to ongoing protests by moderators.Reddit received more government takedown requests than the previous regime and a discussion ensues about the meaning of free speech in the digital era. Some people argue that the term \"free exchange of ideas\" is preferred since it is more clear what is being protected than the term \"freedom of speech\". Others argue that censorship is necessary for various reasons (e.g., copyright or trademark violations, shouting \"fire\" in a crowded theater, direct personal threats of bodily harm), but at the same time is susceptible to abuse, and having a standard in place (e.g., \"does this reasonably harm people in a significant way?\") is difficult, and the term \"free expression\" might be more comprehensive in this case.The post contains a discussion thread discussing free speech and platform moderation on Reddit, with some users arguing that Reddit should have taken more action to remove harmful content, while others argue for free speech. The post also touches on the legal definition of child sexual abuse material and the role of intent in free speech and its consequences. Overall, the post does not contain any significant new information or technological advancements.Reddit experienced outages due to a significant number of subreddits shifting to private, causing stability issues. The outage is not uncommon and happens regularly, according to some users. The CEO of Reddit has been criticized for his past actions, such as creating a special trophy to award the moderator of r/jailbait and r/creepshots, which hosted controversial content. The spread of sketchy-porn related subreddits and their content is hard to monitor and moderate. Users were previously able to add anyone as a moderator on subreddit, leading to fraudulent actions and witch-hunts. Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman also used his admin powers to edit comments from users he didn't like or who criticized him. Therefore, it is reasonable for many users to criticize his handling of Reddit's relationship with Apollo and Christian Selig specifically.Many Reddit users report outages and \"You broke Reddit\" error messages continuing to happen, which may be related to technical issues created by the recent subreddit strikes. Some users propose that the cause may be related to the sudden shift in traffic patterns that occurred when large subreddits went private. There is speculation that Reddit may be denying API calls, leading to problems in accessing the site. Some conspiracy theories suggest Reddit management may have taken down the site or forced reopening to hide the existence of protest-related content, or that self-created DDoS attacks might be occurring to increase the appearance of traffic volume. Overall, reports suggest that outages and problems are more common on some regions or among users of specific interfaces.Reddit experienced a protest where thousands of subreddits went offline, and some were taken over by new moderators. Protesters were reacting to the firing of two popular moderators and communication concerns with Reddit's administration. Some Reddit users speculated that Reddit may try to take over the communities, especially in light of this turmoil, but Reddit has stated they would not do so. Some posts suggest that Reddit's back-end systems were vulnerable to issues due to the number of private subreddits. Advertisers and analytics customers may be concerned about the effects of the protest on user traffic and behaviors.",

Some suggested alternative forums and communities, while others suggested personal AI filters or sub-subreddits for more serious discussion. The conversation also touched on the decline of Reddit's community-focused origins and the impact of new designs on user experience.Reddit's new \"New Reddit\" layout is criticized for having a poor commenting system and prioritizing mass social media and memes over community discussion. Old Reddit's fit about a dozen items per screen and allowed for nested comment threads that made sense, whereas New Reddit is optimized for massive subreddits where comments average vapid. Some suggest alternatives to Reddit, such as having RSS feeds for each site, stablediffusion, localLLaMa, or consolidating around different types of forum software. However, people still appreciate Reddit because it collects many different communities in one place, sorted by popularity, although some subreddits have become saturated with memes and low-quality posts. Reddit does offer unique functions such as content rehosting and network effects that make it hard for alternatives to grow.The post discusses the benefits of using Reddit as a replacement for traditional forums, including a unified account for all communities, a consistent and familiar interface with Markdown for text, easy discovery of new communities, and upvoting/downvoting to moderate spam and bad actors. Discord is compared unfavorably to Reddit due to weak threading and searching capabilities. The post also touches upon the difficulty some individuals face in finding local groups for niche hobbies or interests. The Fediverse/ActivityPub world offers several alternatives to Reddit, such as Kbin, Lemmy, and Brutalinks, that focus on moderation.A forum moderator on Hacker News suggested an ideal forum structure and called on foundations like Wikipedia to run forums as non-profits. Suggestions include democratically run forums, traditional forums run by the people who found them, and personal twitter-like feeds. Also, the data and code should be open-source, cloneable and the owning foundation should set site-wide minimal content rules. Moderation is a huge task, so the forum needs built-in trainable AI agents for an efficient moderation process. Some readers expressed their concerns, stating that democratically elected mods would attract terminally online interest groups, generating problems for moderate-sized forums. Others suggested that Reddit's moderation system is authoritarian and capricious, leaving users at the mercy of little fiefdoms and people on power trips.Users suggest turning to USENET and groups.io for technical discussions, using Google Groups to access USENET groups. Some users are nostalgic about Usenet but voice concerns about spam and abandoned groups. In response to users looking for alternatives to mainstream websites with unfavorable policies, some suggest creating unique platforms with a positive vision rather than simply cloning existing ones, while other users mention successful migration examples like Reddit and Mastodon. Kbin and Lemmy are promoted as alternative platforms with federated features, but there are complaints about both dev teams being associated with extremist political views. In addition, a user suggests creating a personal repository on GitHub as a low-effort way to share technical blog entries.- Discussion and links about the Kbin devs \n- Originally posted in the \"Building a Better Rust Community\" post \n- Post was inaccessible due to the protest against Reddit \n- Will be back tomorrow \n- Public moderation log on kbin.social",

Users mentioned Digg, MySpace, Reddit, Slashdot, Facebook, Dropbox, and Typeform as examples of failed redesigns. Some believe that redesigns are a symptom of monetization greed or a desire to please all users. Others argue that major redesigns risk alienating users and suggest that small design changes are preferable. The Fark website has a loyal user base who prefer its light-hearted, sarcastic tone and aggressive moderation. There is also discussion of swear word filters and selected user payment systems within the thread.Users debating the successes and failures of website redesigns, particularly Fark's redesign causing significant user loss. Reddit's redesign and Lemmy as a potential alternative are also discussed. The importance of user experience and design is highlighted, as well as the need for planning and communication in community migrations. The potential challenges of federation and decentralized social networks for non-technical users is also addressed. Overall, the discussion centers around the impact of UI changes on user engagement and retention.Mastodon, a social media platform, allows people to follow individuals on different instances of the network. Mastodon's growth can be attributed to its well-developed platform, which accommodates new users and its popularity as an alternative to Twitter and Reddit. However, many users do not care about how the technology works and merely want content that is fast and easy. Reddit's redesign has been criticized for being user-hostile, forcing users to switch to mobile apps, and leading to a decline in its quality and relevance. Discord is seen as the closest alternative to Reddit, with both platforms focusing on community engagement. Nevertheless, classic forums and decentralized social media have gained popularity, suggesting a need for a new paradigm in social media.The Tech Times features a discussion thread from Reddit in which users express frustration about social media and their online experiences. Many express a desire to see social media platforms and news media disappear, citing issues such as extremist editorials, clickbait advertisements, and a mess in the comments section. Fark is mentioned as an example of an online community that has gone through various changes. Some users criticize Reddit's redesign, particularly infinite scrolling, which makes it easy to lose reading progress. Others believe that a new technological paradigm for social media is needed, one that is decentralized. Users also discuss ways for Reddit to become a profitable company, including providing API keys for Reddit premium users and firing employees, including CEO Spez.No meaningful content found in the text.",

    "content": "Climate Change WTF is Happening? An OverviewJune 12, 2023 Eliot Jacobson, Ph.D. 12 CommentsAs of June 10, 2023, worldwide data showed the remarkable concurrence of three dramatic climate events.The first WTF is in the Antarctic, where sea-ice extent is setting record lows daily, now fully over 2 million kilometers below the 1991-2020 mean. This is not some one-off event. A decline like this has long been predicted. The impact is that there is a lot more open ocean than normal for this time of year. Open ocean means the ability to absorb incoming solar radiation, and that means further heating in a well-known feedback loop.Using JAXA data, I prepared an image to illustrate just how crazy this moment is. The way you read the image below is that each horizontal blue wavy line is a year\u2019s worth of measured sea-ice extent. Starting with the average extent over the period 1991-2020, I simply compare each day\u2019s extent with that average and plot that point on the year\u2019s blue line. The years shown in this image are 1991-2023, with 2023 in red to highlight just how unusual it is. For those of you with keen eyes, the dip at the lower right corresponds to the year 2016, the year after that last El Ni\u00f1o, and a harbinger of what may lie ahead.Below is a picture courtesy of Kevin Pluck using NSISC data that shows daily Antarctic sea ice extent. 2023 is represented by the blue line that\u2019s well below the rest of the data.The second WTF regards global 2-meter surface temperatures \u2013 where on June 10, for the third consecutive day temperatures breached the 1.5\u00b0C barrier (above the 1850-1900 IPCC baseline). This is not the same as breaking the Paris 1.5\u00b0C barrier, which requires the long-term planetary average to be above 1.5\u00b0C. Nor is it the same as breaching 1.5\u00b0C for the year. These temperature spikes have happened many times before. But this breach does act as a benchmark for the inevitable future that\u2019s coming. For those who like statistics, on June 9, global 2m temperatures reached 4.8 standard deviations above the 1979-2000 mean.And the third WTF is perhaps the furthest from any notion of normalcy. WTF is happening to the world\u2019s oceans, and in particular the North Atlantic? Ocean temperatures have been setting unprecedented daily records, spiking to highs that are shocking climate scientists, as they look for possible reasons.Here is a picture from ClimateReanalyzer.com that gives a sense of world sea surface temperature anomalies on June 10:The following shows daily global sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the region 60S-60N., for the years 1982-2022 in their entirety and through June 10 for the year 2023 (using this data).The recent spike is hard to ignore. This should be the story by itself, and indeed international media has been giving it some attention. But there is a more localized story of ocean heating that I want to focus on.And here is the true WTF image \u2014 the North Atlantic SST anomaly (using this data):Since I first published the North Atlantic image on Twitter, this image has gone viral internationally. As of this writing, it has attracted over 2.7 million views on Twitter and has been featured in media worldwide. That\u2019s how hungry people are to know what\u2019s happening. The current North Atlantic anomaly is why I am writing this post and will be the subject of everything that follows.The CERES website publishes monthly updates to what is commonly known as the Earth Energy Imbalance or EEI. This data allows us to know the difference between incoming solar radiation and outgoing radiation from all sources. That difference is the effective rate of heating of the planet. As of March, 2023, on an annualized basis, the EEI was 1.61 Watts per square meter. That might not sound like a lot, but on a global basis it is about equal to the energy released from 13 Hiroshima sized nuclear bombs exploding every second.As you probably know, the planet\u2019s oceans absorb about 89% of the excess heat generated by global warming. Over the last three La Ni\u00f1a years on average, the ocean\u2019s share of the EEI has been equivalent to about 9.8 Hiroshima bombs per second, or about 930 million Hiroshimas in total. The ocean is hot and getting hotter all the time, but until now we haven\u2019t directly seen that heat.There is an obvious reason to explain some of the ocean heating that is happening right now: the unexpectedly rapid onset of El Ni\u00f1o, which typically drives massive surface heating of the Eastern tropical pacific. But what about other parts of the ocean? What about the North Atlantic.Here\u2019s where things get esoteric. As of January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization put a limit on the sulfur content in shipping fuels, reducing the global upper limit on sulfur content from 3.50% to 0.50%. Here is a link to an article describing this change. This reduced limit was mandatory and led to over a 75% drop in the emission of sulfur oxides. While great for the environment in many respects (e.g. less acid rain and ocean acidification), there was also a not-so-unexpected consequence.Sulfate aerosols, in combination with atmospheric particulates, increase the amount of incoming sunlight reflected away from the Earth, effectively dimming the planet\u2019s surface. Lasting only weeks to months in the atmosphere, these sulfate aerosols must be continually replenished to have their cooling impact. The IPCC suggests that current sulfur aerosol levels are contributing in the neighborhood of 0.5\u00b0 C to total global cooling, offsetting warming that would otherwise rapidly occur. This is commonly known as \u201cglobal dimming.\u201dBy cleaning up shipping fuels, massive regions of the world\u2019s oceans that were protected from heating by shipping sulfate aerosols are now experiencing rapid warming. This includes the main shipping routes between Asia and the Western US as well as the major routes from the Eastern US to Europe and the Middle East. And that\u2019s where the warming is happening. This rapid heating is known as \u201ctermination shock,\u201d and it appears to be, at least in part, what\u2019s happening right now.This image, shared by Leon Simons on Twitter, highlights the regions of the oceans most impacted by this sudden change in sulfur content: There is another possible input to this heating worthy of note. Dust from the Sahara typically blows west this time of year, blocking incoming radiation while trapping existing heat. So far this year, the dust has not come. The lack of dust is notable and could also be a direct cause of some of the North Atlantic heating. For more, here is an article on the topic.And don\u2019t forget about the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai explosive underwater volcanic eruption on January 15, 2022 that sent massive plumes of water vapor into the stratosphere. While I don\u2019t know of any direct connection of this event to recent ocean warming, the linked article shows there is wide-spread consensus that this event could accelerate global warming over the next few years. However, it is not at all clear how generalized global warming of the atmosphere from stratospheric water vapor could cause a relatively sudden spike in ocean temperatures.It is my opinion that the combination of years of ocean heating generated by the EEI, heating in Antarctica due to open ocean, shifts in winds and surface heating due to El Ni\u00f1o, lack of Saharan dust, and IMO 2020 have together triggered unprecedented ocean surface warming. I don\u2019t have the expertise to put these in any particular causal order, but that doesn\u2019t really matter. The consequences are clear.As we enter Northern hemisphere summer, large regions of the planet will experience all-time record heatwaves, fires, storms and flooding. These events will set records in intensity, duration and frequency. The planet\u2019s overall temperature will spike to new highs for the modern era, with 1.5\u00b0C in sight for 2024. Antarctic polar sea-ice will continue its retreat from \u201cnormal\u201d, exposing more open ocean to incoming solar radiation and heating, especially as the sun returns later this year. Crops will fail. Infrastructure will break beyond repair. Climate migration will spike. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources continues to spew at a near-record rate, while the Paris limit of 1.5\u00b0C requires these emissions be reduced about 7% per year for the next decade.And this is all happening in the midst of the current political and social chaos, while the world attempts to recover from a pandemic that is still ongoing but mostly ignored by global media.These next two years are a pre-amble to what it will mean for the world to pass the Paris 1.5\u00b0C barrier. The end of global industrial civilization is where we are headed right now, not at some future dystopian moment. I wish I had a hopeful word to end with. But I don\u2019t.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News thread discussing the concurrence of recent climatic events leading to a heated debate on the cause, extent, and severity of climate change. \n\nWhile some comments deride the article as alarmist, others argue that the data supports the idea that we are in a climate emergency and that something needs to be done. \n\nThere is also a discussion on the mismanagement of forests that has contributed to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in California,\u00a0Canada, and Australia. \n\nFurthermore, the thread discusses the potential impact of the absence of dust from Sahara, which is essential for many ecosystems' survival and how the greening of the Sahara will affect the climate.\n\nAlthough some comments criticize the article's pessimism, it serves as a reminder of humanity's ability to adapt and overcome.Experts have urged governments and businesses to act quickly in the face of climate change, which could severely damage infrastructure through flooding, wildfires, and other climate-related disasters. While many remain optimistic about the human ability to adapt and overcome, the deep integration of CO2 extrusion into our economies and actions constitutes a significant obstacle to a positive outcome and necessitates immediate action. Climate change has increased greenhouse gas warming and various feedback that could force millions to migrate further inland or out of their countries, leaving governments to handle these effects. Developed nations need to address climate change through active measures, including agriculture conservation, reducing emissions, and improving infrastructure.- 31 countries face insufficient resilience to ecological threats by 2050, leading to mass population displacement\n- Regions most affected are sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa\n- 3.5 billion people may suffer from food insecurity by 2050, increasing civil unrest and competition over resources\n- Lack of resilience in these countries exposes developed nations to increased influxes of refugees\n- Technological solutions such as degrowth and geo-engineering present differing viewpoints and risk factors\n- Bill Gates' involvement in water reserves and funding of mini-nukes raises concerns for some commentators \n- COVID-19's impact on the world economy did not lead to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels, according to Mauna Loa data.A discussion surrounding the tension between the urgency of climate change and the need to motivate action without causing panic. Bill Gates' recent book on climate change solutions is mentioned in this context. There is also debate around the effectiveness of geoengineering solutions versus decarbonization efforts, and the potential unintended consequences of geoengineering. The idea of Western economies pushing climate change as a narrative for maintaining global hegemony is also mentioned. The idea of geoengineering as a viable solution to the climate crisis is discussed, with some identifying the lack of legal frameworks around geoengineering as problematic. The potential negative effects of geoengineering solutions on aesthetics and animal ecosystems are also discussed.The comments discuss the potential use of geoengineering to address the impact of climate change, specifically by using sulfur aerosols to increase global cooling. Some argue that this could have negative consequences, such as exacerbating acid rain and ozone damage, while others suggest it could be a viable solution in conjunction with carbon emissions reduction and carbon capture efforts. There is frustration that measures like this have been debated without consensus on action, while the shipping industry has been emitting sulfur aerosols for years. Some commenters express concern about the potential for geoengineering efforts to be controlled by those who benefit from fossil fuel use, and emphasize the need for caution and weighing of potential consequences. There is also discussion of the effects of climate change on global agriculture and political instability.",

Patent trolls are now using the Inter Partes Review (IPR) process in ways that seem like abuse of the system, leading the Patent Office to seek reforms to re-impose standing requirements. The Patent Office is concerned about the vulnerability of IPR processes to exploitation. Lawyers and trolls use the existing system to shake down patent holders, even offering to withdraw legal complaints for money. Critics of the proposed rule say it is aligned with the interests of patent holders, meaning there may be a balance of forces in favor of patent abusers. The conclusion people are making is that patents are becoming difficult to overcome, which creates resistance for innovation and technology advancements.The article discusses the role of patents in technology, where they are intended to encourage innovation by providing protection for new inventions. However, the author argues that the patent system has many flaws, including granting patents that lack detailed instructional information, leading to the creation of \"BS style\" patents with vague descriptors. Additionally, trade secrets are limited in their protection and make innovation less competitive. Opponents argue that removing all intellectual property protections would make innovation more accessible and increase market competition. However, advocates argue that removing these protections would eliminate any ability to profit from time and money invested in development or innovation. The government plays a role in upholding patents, and recent changes aim to protect smaller entities and startups who may have limited resources to defend their patents. Critics warn that without effective patent laws, the US may fall behind technologically, giving countries like China a competitive edge.",

The size and scope of the government effort to accumulate data revealing the minute details of Americans' lives are described soberly and at length by the director's own panel of experts in a newly declassified report. Haines had first tasked her advisers in late 2021 with untangling a web of secretive business arrangements between commercial data brokers and US intelligence community members. What that report ended up saying constitutes a nightmare scenario for privacy defenders. \u201cThis report reveals what we feared most,\u201d says Sean Vitka, a policy attorney at the nonprofit Demand Progress. \u201cIntelligence agencies are flouting the law and buying information about Americans that Congress and the Supreme Court have made clear the government should not have.\u201d In the shadow of years of inaction by the US Congress on comprehensive privacy reform, a surveillance state has been quietly growing in the legal system's cracks. Little deference is paid by prosecutors to the purpose or intent behind limits traditionally imposed on domestic surveillance activities. More craven interpretations of aging laws are widely used to ignore them. As the framework guarding what privacy Americans do have grows increasingly frail, opportunities abound to split hairs in court over whether such rights are even enjoyed by our digital counterparts.\u201cI\u2019ve been warning for years that if using a credit card to buy an American\u2019s personal information voids their Fourth Amendment rights, then traditional checks and balances for government surveillance will crumble,\u201d Ron Wyden, a US senator from Oregon, says. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WIRED was unable to reach any members of the senior advisory panel, whose names have been redacted in the report. Former members have included ex-CIA officials of note and top defense industry leaders.Wyden had pressed Haines, previously the number two at the Central Intelligence Agency, to release the panel's report during a March 8 hearing. Haines replied at the time that she believed it \u201cabsolutely\u201d should be read by the public. On Friday, the report was declassified and released by the ODNI, which has been embroiled in a legal fight with the digital rights nonprofit the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) over a host of related documents. \u201cThis report makes it clear that the government continues to think it can buy its way out of constitutional protections using taxpayers\u2019 own money,\" says Chris Baumohl, a law fellow at EPIC. \u201cCongress must tackle the government\u2019s data broker pipeline this year, before it considers any reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,\u201d he said (referring to the ongoing political fight over the so-called \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of US surveillance). The ODNI's own panel of advisers makes clear that the government\u2019s static interpretations of what constitutes \u201cpublicly available information\u201d poses a significant threat to the public. The advisers decry existing policies that automatically conflate, in the first place, being able to buy information with it being considered \u201cpublic.\u201d The information being commercially sold about Americans today is \u201cmore revealing, available on more people (in bulk), less possible to avoid, and less well understood\u201d than that which is traditionally thought of as being \u201cpublicly available.\u201dMOST POPULARIDEASThe End of Influencers on InstagramSTEPHANIE MCNEALCULTUREApple\u2019s Vision Pro Isn\u2019t the FutureKATE KNIBBSCULTUREThe 15 Best Shows on HBO Max Right NowJENNIFER M. WOODGEARThe Best Laptop Backpacks for Work (and Life)MEDEA GIORDANOPerhaps most controversially, the report states that the government believes it can \u201cpersistently\u201d track the phones of \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d without a warrant, so long as it pays for the information. Were the government to simply demand access to a device's location instead, it would be considered a Fourth Amendment \u201csearch\u201d and would require a judge's sign-off. But because companies are willing to sell the information\u2014not only to the US government but to other companies as well\u2014the government considers it \u201cpublicly available\u201d and therefore asserts that it \u201ccan purchase it.\u201dIt is no secret, the report adds, that it is often trivial \u201cto deanonymize and identify individuals\u201d from data that was packaged as ethically fine for commercial use because it had been \u201canonymized\u201d first. Such data may be useful, it says, to \u201cidentify every person who attended a protest or rally based on their smartphone location or ad-tracking records.\u201d Such civil liberties concerns are prime examples of how \u201clarge quantities of nominally \u2018public\u2019 information can result in sensitive aggregations.\u201d What's more, information collected for one purpose \u201cmay be reused for other purposes,\u201d which may \u201craise risks beyond those originally calculated,\u201d an effect called \u201cmission creep.\u201d Most Americans have at least some idea of how a law enforcement investigation unfolds (if only from watching years of police procedurals). This idea imagines a cop whose ability to surveil them, turn their phone into a tracking device, or start squeezing records out of businesses they frequent, are all gated behind evidentiary thresholds, like reasonable doubt and probable cause. These are legal hurdles that no longer bother an increasing number of government agencies. Access to the most sensitive information about a person was once usually obtained in the course of a \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cpredicated\u201d investigation, the report says. Not anymore. \u201cToday, in a way that far fewer Americans seem to understand, and even fewer of them can avoid, [commercially available information] includes information on nearly everyone,\u201d it says. Both the \u201cvolume and sensitivity\u201d of information the government can purchase has exploded in recent years due to \u201clocation-tracking and other features of smartphones,\u201d and the \u201cadvertising-based monetization model\u201d that underlies much of the internet, the report says. \u201cIn the wrong hands,\u201d the ODNI\u2019s advisers warn, the same mountain of data the government is quietly accumulating could be turned against Americans to \u201cfacilitate blackmail, stalking, harassment, and public shaming.\u201d Notably, these are all offenses that have been committed by intelligence agencies and White House administrations in the past. What constraints do exist on domestic surveillance activities are all a direct response to that history of political sabotage, disinformation, and abusive violations of Americans' rights. The report notes: \u201cThe government would never have been permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all times, to log and track most of their social interactions, or to keep flawless records of all their reading habits. Yet smartphones, connected cars, web tracking technologies, the Internet of Things, and other innovations have had this effect without government participation.\u201dMOST POPULARIDEASThe End of Influencers on InstagramSTEPHANIE MCNEALCULTUREApple\u2019s Vision Pro Isn\u2019t the FutureKATE KNIBBSCULTUREThe 15 Best Shows on HBO Max Right NowJENNIFER M.

    "hn_content": "The US government is purchasing large amounts of personal data from data brokers. The availability of this data means that anyone could be tracking it, including the government. Proposed solutions include restricting the collection of such data and preventing the government from acquiring it through non-market means. There is a need for better privacy laws, but creating a market for personal data could be problematic. The United States operates under the \"third-party doctrine,\" meaning that people who voluntarily give information to third parties, such as banks and ISPs, have \"no reasonable expectation of privacy,\" allowing the US government to obtain their data without a warrant. Although there has been jurisprudence around this doctrine, limitations on data retention periods and warrant requirements are needed. Personal privacy is\u00a0hard to come by, and while law enforcement officers deserve privacy, obtaining data through unconstitutional means will not work to maintain a healthy democracy.The article discusses how companies like CNN collect data through their terms of service and are legally allowed to sell that information, potentially to government agencies like the CIA. The comments discuss the dangers of this data being in the hands of the government and the potential for abuse, citing historical examples of governments using collected data for nefarious purposes. Some suggest updating laws to prohibit the sale of personal information while others propose stricter measures like decentralized investigative agencies or enacting the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment. The article also touches on recent developments in France where law enforcement may be able to activate cameras and microphones on a suspect's device without notification. The comments recommend enabling iOS Lockdown Mode to protect against targeted spying.The article discusses the government's use of cell phone data to identify people of interest. Although search warrants allow access to this data, the article expresses concern that the government may be buying this data without judicial oversight, thus violating constitutional protections. The government's ability to identify individuals based on phone data is not in question. The article focuses on the ethics of collecting mass data and the potential for misuse. The data brokers contracted by the government usually do not collect identifiable information, and so purchase of mobile location data is the only potential 4th Amendment violation. Due process has been followed when the government obtained location information from Google. Some commenters bring up the J6 case and highlight how surveillance is being used but not for the purpose of protecting America from attacks or threats, but rather to maintain power and control.A report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence reveals that US government agencies are purchasing commercially available citizen data from data brokers and aggregators. The report found that the data was sold by five major companies named in the PRISM program. The report has prompted concerns from privacy advocates over the potential misuse of this data and the lack of oversight and protections in place. Furthermore, some are concerned about the availability of this data to US adversaries. The report advocates for more precise privacy-protecting guidance for commercially available information, suggesting progress in addressing issues surrounding the new, abundant and detailed data available to the US government.- The US government is building a massive data warehouse on its citizens.\n- The post discusses the potential use of this data and its impact on politics.\n- Commenters inquire about purchasing similar data and paid data scrubbing services.\n- The article mentions the 4th amendment in relation to the use of credit cards to buy personal information and the possible erosion of government surveillance checks and balances.\n- A discussion on the relevance of the 2nd amendment versus the 4th amendment to current events and political philosophy.",
