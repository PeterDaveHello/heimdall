A veteran you could say.He\u2019s a rather intelligent self-admitted high school dropout that loves his choice of drugs and guns\u2026 plus, he has a thing for operating in the grey area of the law.That combination makes for a perfect storm\u2026 and that it did.You see, William\u2019s notoriety reaches further than just LowEndTalk\u2026 for a while, William was a bit of an Internet celebrity.Way back in the early 2010s, William was directly responsible for an infamous Austrian court case revolving around Tor, specifically running Tor exit nodes.It rang bells around the internet, particularly sites that revolve around hosting (like us!), torrenting, Tor, privacy, and beyond. Even reaching NBC news.Why? Because it centered around child porn, and the moral argument that exists surrounding decentralized internet, plus, the people that help make that happen (running exit nodes).Quite a bit of time has passed since this all went down, and it\u2019s time this story gets revisited\u2026So, let\u2019s take it from the top:It All Starts With The Raid(Austrian court order dated November 12th, 2012.)Back in 2012, another LowEndTalk veteran named @joepie91 created a (now defunct) site simply titled: \u201cRaided For Operating A Tor Exit Node,\u201d revolving around the case.It was only thanks to the WayBackMachine that I was able to get a bit of information surrounding the case from Joepie91\u2019s old site.Here\u2019s how it all starts:On Wednesday morning, around 10:00 AM local time, the apartment of the Austrian William Weber was raided by the Styrian Landeskriminalamt (LKA), a government agency, as a part of their investigation into a child pornography ring operating on/over the TOR anonymity network. During the raid, numerous computers and other electronic devices, as well as legal and registered firearms and some other items, were seized. William is likely to be charged with distribution and possible production of child pornography.The TOR network, originally created by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, allows internet users to remain anonymous on the internet, and is used by journalists, activists, and military organizations around the world, to bypass censorship and communicate securely. To accomplish this, the network routes all traffic through a number of relay nodes before delivering the traffic to its final destination, making it infeasible to detect where the traffic originated from. William is the operator of several \u201cexit nodes\u201d (final hops) on the network, and this is an interview with him.The site continues with an interview between @joepie91 and William:What are your reasons for running a TOR node, and fighting this accusation?I believe in freedom of information; I mainly run the exit nodes to make it possible for the not so privileged folks to have uncensored access to the internet, without fear of government prosecution. There are currently not many countries with a clear legal standpoint on TOR nodes. Some countries, like Germany, have complicated legal constructs regarding liability for software like TOR, but this only really applies to registered companies (such as the Telemediengesetz, the German telecommunications law). I\u2019d like to establish a legal base \u2013 at least in Austria, and probably for the entire EU. Additionally, I was accused of sharing (and possibly producing) child pornography on a clearnet forum via an image hosting site that was probably tapped. If convicted, this could land me in jail for 6 to 10 years.What hardware has been taken?My colocated servers have not been taken, most likely as they are outside of EU jurisdiction (Liechtenstein, US, Hong Kong). It is of course possible that they are being wiretapped by now. The server running the exit node in question, was in Poland, and was already disabled since I moved to a different ISP. Only my flat was raided, which resulted in confiscation of around 20 computers (mainly barebone PCs, HP storage MicroServers and thin clients), external hard drives and USB thumbdrives, my main computer, gaming consoles, tablets (2 iPads) and my phones (Samsung Galaxy Note and a HTC PDA).What was the raid like?At 10AM, I was picked up at my workplace by the Styrian Landeskriminalamt (LKA), basically the Austrian equivalent of the FBI for local matters (state police). I was handed a copy of the court order for the search and confiscation of any computer-related hardware and storage media. Since I was not allowed to touch any computers anymore, I had to have a co-worker get me the phone number of the lawyer, who advised me not to say anything. My work laptop was confiscated, and the LKA brought me to my flat, where I had to allow them entry. If I refused, they would probably have forced open the door.Seven LKA officers, two police offers, and a court-appointed expert witness started a search of the flat, without respecting my privacy or property whatsoever. Paper documents in a cupboard were read, and no care was taken of my cat (who I was allowed to lock into another room later). My storage cubes (HP MicroServers) were confiscated without any regard for the hardware \u2013 the power cords were simply ripped out / hard shutdown, instead of properly shutting them down by the operating system. My main PC was shut down normally, as far as i could determine. After finishing the search in my living room, they continued in my bedroom, where they confiscated my legal firearms, as well as my cable TV receiver, and my Xbox 360. Despite my statement that all firearms and ammunition were legally owned and registered, having passed all background checks, this was doubted by one of the LKA officers due to the caliber.I was asked to open my safe, which I did, where more legal firearms were found (3 handguns), plus a few hundred Euros in cash, some rare coins, and around 3 grams of Hashish and 10 grams of Marijuana for personal use. After finding the drugs, I was asked where I purchased them, without explaining my rights. I replied that I did not wish to answer this question, and repeatedly stated that they were exclusively for personal use. The handguns and drugs were confiscated as a \u201cZufallsfund\u201d (a German term for something that was not expected to be found during a search \u2013 a literal translation would be \u201ccoincidence find\u201d). After this, I was allowed to lock my cat into the bathroom \u2013 which was either not searched, or searched without me noticing.Some other things that were confiscated, were my pocket knife and a machete \u2013 both of which are fully legal to own under Austrian law. Larger and more threatening kitchen knives, however, did not get confiscated. I was not arrested and free to go after the search; I was however told by police that I had a temporary weapons ban for now, due to drug usage. One of the LKA officers informed me that I should show up for question at the LKA office in Graz, at 13:30 that day. I was also given her number, which was quite ironic, given they just confiscated my phones.After the search finished, I first took care of my cat, who was extremely scared at that point, and then went to my bank to pick up an emergency phone and cash from a bank deposit box. These deposit boxes are explicitly protected under Austrian law. I used this money to purchase a new laptop. At this time, I was likely being followed by civil police on the street (who were under the impression I didn\u2019t notice them), but they let me off after entering the bank building \u2013 again, probably because of laws preventing them from going any further.Is it common for someone accused of such a crime not to be arrested immediately?No, not as far as i know; I expected to be arrested as well, but seeing as they came to my workplace first, they don\u2019t seem to have enough proof to even break into my flat by force. I do however expect that I am being monitored, it is possible that they are just waiting for me to contact someone regarding the raid.What do you believe the legal consequences will be for drug possession?In the best case, none, as I have no previous convictions, and I am not on probation. As the amount is very low, the sentence must be converted into 2 years of probation (\u00a7 35 SMG). The only way around that would be convincing the judge that I sold them, but I believe that even in that case, it will most likely just be a fine and a probation due to the amount (approximately 4 grams of pure THC in total, I\u2019d guess). The drugs are the least of my concerns right now.Have you been in contact with the LKA? Have they contacted you since? Do you have any information from the lawyer, or any idea what\u2019s going to happen next?At 13:30, I showed up as appointed, at the LKAs Graz office. They let me wait outside for 20 minutes before someone finally escorted me to the officer in charge. Again, I was not immediately informed of my rights at this time.I was handed two copies of the search warrant, with a list of confiscated items \u2013 one of them for my hardware, the other one for my guns and the drugs \u2013 which I agreed to sign. It was only at this time that I was informed of my right to consult a lawyer or to not say anything at all. I declined, as I had already gotten into contact with a lawyer before that. I, once again, told them where my firearms were purchased and that they were legal, and that the confiscated drugs were only for my personal use. I again declined to answer questions regarding the source of the drugs.After this, I had them show me the offending IP address, which I identified as belonging to me in the specified timeframe. I explained that this was a TOR exit node under my control at this time. I attempted to explain what TOR is, and they appeared to be familiar with it, as the atmosphere suddenly became more friendly. They probably understood that it was very unlikely they had a child pornographer sitting in their office.Some questions about my motives followed, which I attempted to answer \u2013 but this seemingly failed. I could not make them understand why I would \u201cwaste\u201d resources and bandwidth (translating into money) to run a TOR node. I informed them that I was already contacted by the Polish police in May about this IP, regarding hacking attempts originating from it. Back then I had already explained to Polish police that this was a TOR exit node, and that no logfiles were held. After the report of hacking attempts, I shut down the TOR node on this server, but apparently this was too late and they were investigating (and/or wiretapping) already.I was handed the interrogation transcript, which I agreed to sign after reading it. I was free to go, but again they failed to inform me of something of critical importance \u2013 that I was not allowed to leave the country without consent of police. I was informed of this by my boss later. This was quite a surprise and very annoying, as my family and girlfriend live in Slovenia, and I frequently visit them on weekends which is now much harder if not impossible in the next months.The Raid AftermathAfter William is raided and accused of distributing and/or producing child pornography\u2026 they don\u2019t arrest him.They then spend years trying to build a case and it results in a conviction of \u201csupporting the transfer of underage pornography.\u201dIt was at this point in researching the case I realized almost all of the different sources I was using contained inaccurate information or broken links.He hadn\u2019t been active over on LowEndTalk in a while, so, I decided to reach out to William directly on Telegram for answers to a couple of questions\u2026Luckily, he got back to me almost immediately:Did you accept a plea deal or take it to court?The Austrian legal system has no plea deals. I was charged and convicted with the support, not the ownership. There is ownership, sale, distribution for no monetary gain, and support of general distribution. The last is what I got and the lowest of all.But you were found guilty of that and given probation, though?Yes, as they had to give me the minimum sentence. By law they were right as the law only protected registered companies, unlike in Germany for example. The law was changed a few weeks later to include private persons and sole traders as protected lsps, not just companies, but they had to convict me. No choice in the end.What was the sentence?I received 5 years probation instead of a 3-month jail sentence, but I left Austria shortly after sentencing. There was no probation officer or anything similar. They let me leave without putting in an Inter or Europol warrant to return me. The probation was just on paper in the end.I noticed they mentioned \u201clogs\u201d of you talking about hosting CP, can you elaborate?They took a bunch of IRC logs where I stated what I can and can\u2019t host at a web hosting provider I owned. The logs do exist but are taken out of context. Why did they originally want to raid you? Did you know or was it random?I rented a server in Poland and someone uploaded CP to an Austrian image hoster. They reported it to the Austrian police, which contacted the ISP, which gave them my WHMCS login IP and then subpoenaed UPC Austria for my address, then queried the weapons registry.(William is pictured with an AK-74, ammo is 7.62mm not 5.45mm.)It didn\u2019t go to the cybercrime unit, but child abuse. They had no idea what Tor was. A lot of the articles written about you call you Austrian, but you\u2019re from Israel, right?I am born there but have Austrian, Israeli, Kosovo, and Slovak passports. I grew up in Austria, my family had to leave around 1940 for obvious reasons.How much did the court case cost you?I paid my lawyer about 6k euros. I still owe him probably 3k.What do you do now?I left Austria and now work for a German company in IT, and have a data center in Kosovo\u2026 hosting grey area things there. Warez primarily.Also, I do want to add that I have more backstory. The CP was not the only reason for the raid.What do you mean?Someone used the same exit to hack a NATO facility in Poland, which deals with chemical and biological weapons. Disarming, etc.The US tried to extradite me from Croatia in 2017, with not much more info than national security.They lost their case as I am married to a local and cannot be extradited outside the EU.Interesting. Where do you stay now?For most of the summer, I am in Croatia. Autumn is mostly in Kosovo/Albania, winter is mostly in Asia, don\u2019t like the cold.I asked him for some images for the article here and he sent me quite a few, one of them being him smoking a joint.It led to a conversation about drug use, in which William says:I can\u2019t smoke anymore sadly, too much paranoia.The Tor thing definitely left me damaged in some ways. I have an insanely high rivotril/klonopin (clonazepam) prescription for social phobia. To a certain extent, the Tor situation also drove me further into the grey area life.Would you do it again?Sure, I still run 3Gbit of exits, but under an anonymous offshore company.Do you have a website?He sent me the following:Ip6.im \u2013 free IPv6.Basehost.eu \u2013 offshore hosting in Kosovo. Adria-IX.org \u2013 Adriatic IX.Why Kosovo?I have very good relations with Serbia but like to keep options open, with my investment into Kosovo I received citizenship. It\u2019s also not recognized by a lot of countries and not a UN member, which means I can ignore a lot of abuse for warez and even spam.Do you have any future plans?No idea, other than what I already mentioned. I work a lot on my internet exchange. I deal with IPs a lot and sell hosting on the side, too.I\u2019m always bankrupt but have no debt, drive a solid paid-off car and we own our house in Croatia and Kosovo.Our conversation ended there with William sending me a picture about 5 minutes later\u2026(Picture taken in Croatia by William at his place.)He added, \u201cAlso take this, maybe it\u2019s useful, much better than grey Austria. This is what my life looks like nowadays.\u201dIt Goes Without Saying\u2026Child porn is bad. Very bad. It shouldn\u2019t be produced nor shared, ever.Ultimately no one will ever know if William was intentionally \u201csupporting child porn\u201d \u2014 but if you ask me?I think it\u2019s unlikely. As William said, he\u2019s one of those free-speech Tor guys\u2026With the good of decentralized solutions also comes the bad. It creates an anonymous environment that someone involved in that kind of thing would thrive on.The moral question really comes down to:Is it Williams\u2019s fault the server he hosted in Poland as a Tor exit node was the middleman for bad things?Maybe, if intentionally ignored\u2026 but that\u2019s kind of the point of Tor.You can\u2019t look, so you don\u2019t look\u2026 and you ignore the bad things that happen under the surface.How do you know he intentionally supported child porn, instead of just supporting free speech? It\u2019s a catch-22.Don\u2019t get me wrong, either. William has his issues and is far from perfect.He\u2019s at fault in the sense he loves to operate in the grey area\u2026 he thrives in it.You can tell because he\u2019s still actively doing the same thing that caused him all of his issues in the past. But he doesn\u2019t care.If there\u2019s one thing for certain?It\u2019s that William is going to be William regardless if you like him or not.Related Posts:The Future of the Coleco ADAMSeismic Industry Shift: Is RHEL About to Vanish From the Web Hosting Landscape?A New Mysterious Streaming Platform, Kick, Is Poised To Overtake Amazon-Backed TwitchDid You Miss Any of These Posts Which are Burning Up Our Analytics?Contabo is Celebrating 20 Years with Special Deals on Cheap VPS and Cheap Dedicated Servers Around t...Can You Get a VPS for $1/Month?

A virtual private server works like a dedicated physical server but relies on a virtualized software engine referred to as a \"hypervisor\" to provide the interface between the physical server and the virtual instance (aka \"vps\").Why do I want a VPS?By choosing a \"VPS\" you are using a sliver of a physical dedicated server, which means lower costs, because you are only utilizing a piece of the physical capacities of the underlying server. Additionally, VPS plans often provide easy migration from location to location and server to server along with being able to upgrade or downgrade your resources with only a few clicks (rather than having to change physical server components).Where can I find a cheap VPS?On LowEndBox of course!

    "content": "llama2.cHave you ever wanted to inference a baby Llama 2 model in pure C? No? Well, now you can!With this code you can train the Llama 2 LLM architecture from scratch in PyTorch, then save the weights to a raw binary file, then load that into one ~simple 500-line C file (run.c) that inferences the model, simply in fp32 for now. On my cloud Linux devbox a dim 288 6-layer 6-head model (~15M params) inferences at ~100 tok/s in fp32, and about the same on my M1 MacBook Air. I was somewhat pleasantly surprised that one can run reasonably sized models (few ten million params) at highly interactive rates with an approach this simple.Please note that this is just a weekend project: I took nanoGPT, tuned it to implement the Llama-2 architecture instead of GPT-2, and the meat of it was writing the C inference engine in run.c. As such, this is not really meant to be a production-grade library right now.Hat tip to llama.cpp for inspiring this project. I wanted something super minimal so I chose to hard-code the llama-2 architecture, stick to fp32, and just roll one inference file of pure C with no dependencies.feel the magicLet's just run a baby Llama 2 model in C. You need a model checkpoint. Download this 15M parameter model I trained on the TinyStories dataset (~58MB download) and place it into the default checkpoint directory out:wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin -P out(if that doesn't work try google drive). Compile and run the C code:gcc -O3 -o run run.c -lm./run out/model.binYou'll see the text stream a sample. On my M1 MacBook Air this runs at ~100 tokens/s, not bad for super naive fp32 single-threaded C code. See performance for compile flags that can significantly speed this up. Sample output:Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play sports with his friends. He was very good at throwing and catching balls. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a new shirt to wear to a party. Timmy thought it was impressive and asked his mom to explain what a shirt could be for. \"A shirt is like a special suit for a basketball game,\" his mom said. Timmy was happy to hear that and put on his new shirt. He felt like a soldier going to the army and shouting. From that day on, Timmy wore his new shirt every time he played sports with his friends at the party. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily and her friend Emma were playing with a ball. Emma threw the ball too hard and it hit Lily's face. Lily felt embarrassed and didn't want to play anymore. Emma asked Lily what was wrong, and Lily told her about her memory. Emma told Lily that she was embarrassed because she had thrown the ball too hard. Lily felt bad achieved tok/s: 98.746993347843922Update: I've now also uploaded a bigger checkpoint. This one is dim 512, 8 layers, 8 heads and context length 1024, a ~44M param Transformer. It trained for 200K iterations batch size 32 on 4XA100 40GB GPUs in ~8 hours. You can use this bigger and more powerful checkpoint like so:wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model44m.bin -P out44m./run out44m/model44m.binOn my MacBook Air compiled with $ gcc -Ofast -o run run.c -lm this ran at ~150 tok/s. Still way too fast! I have to train an even bigger checkpoint... This model samples more coherent and diverse stories:Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her toys on top of her bed. One day, she decided to have a tea party with her stuffed animals. She poured some tea into a tiny teapot and put it on top of the teapot. Suddenly, her little brother Max came into the room and wanted to join the tea party too. Lily didn't want to share her tea and she told Max to go away. Max started to cry and Lily felt bad. She decided to yield her tea party to Max and they both shared the teapot. But then, something unexpected happened. The teapot started to shake and wiggle. Lily and Max were scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, the teapot started to fly towards the ceiling and landed on the top of the bed. Lily and Max were amazed and they hugged each other. They realized that sharing was much more fun than being selfish. From that day on, they always shared their tea parties and toys.howtoIt should be possible to load the weights released by Meta but I haven't tried because the inference speed, even of the 7B model, would probably be not great with this baby single-threaded C program. So in this repo we focus on more narrow applications, and train the same architecture but from scratch, in this case on the TinyStories dataset for fun.First let's download and pretokenize some source dataset, e.g. I like TinyStories so this is the only example currently available in this repo. But it should be very easy to add datasets, see the code.python tinystories.py downloadpython tinystories.py pretokenizeThen train our model:python train.pySee the train.py script for more exotic launches and hyperparameter overrides. I didn't tune the hyperparameters, I expect simple hyperparameter exploration should give better models. Totally understand if you want to skip model training, for simple demo just download my pretrained model and save it into the directory out:wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin -P outOnce we have the model.bin file, we can inference in C. Compile the C code first:gcc -O3 -o run run.c -lmYou can now run it simply as./run out/model.binWatch the tokens stream by, fun! We can also run the PyTorch inference script for comparison (to run, add model.ckpt to /out if you haven't already):python sample.pyWhich gives the same results. More detailed testing will be done in test_all.py, run as:$ pytestCurrently you will need two files to test or sample: the model.bin file and the model.ckpt file from PyTorch training I ran earlier. I have to think through running the tests without having to download 200MB of data.performance(NOTE: this guide is not great because I personally spend a lot of my time in Python land and don't have an amazing understanding of a lot of these features and flags. If someone does and is willing to help document and briefly describe some of these and their tradeoffs, I'd welcome a PR)There are many ways to potentially speed up this code depending on your system. Here we document a few together with a high-level guide on what they do. Here's again the default way to compile, but using -O3:gcc -O3 -o run run.c -lm-O3 includes optimizations that are expensive in terms of compile time and memory usage. Including vectorization, loop unrolling, and predicting branches. Here's a few more to try.-Ofast Run additional optimizations which may break compliance with the C/IEEE specifications, in addition to -O3. See the GCC docs for more information.-ffast-math breaks IEEE compliance, e.g. allowing reordering of operations, disables a bunch of checks for e.g. NaNs (assuming they don't happen), enables reciprocal approximations, disables signed zero, etc.-funsafe-math-optimizations a more limited form of -ffast-math, that still breaks IEEE compliance but doesn't have all of the numeric/error handling changes from -ffasth-math. See the GCC docs for more information.-march=native Compile the program to use the architecture of the machine you're compiling on rather than a more generic CPU. This may enable additional optimizations and hardware-specific tuning such as improved vector instructions/width.Putting a few of these together, the fastest throughput I saw so far on my MacBook Air (M1) is with:gcc -Ofast -o run run.c -lmAlso, I saw someone report higher throughput replacing gcc with clang.unsorted todoswhy is there a leading space in C sampling code when we ./run?todo multiquery support? doesn't seem as useful for smaller models that run on CPU (?)todo support inferencing beyond max_seq_len steps, have to think through the kv cachewhy is MFU so low (~10%) on my A100 40GB for training?weird errors with torch.compile and wandb when using DDPmake more better tests to decrease yoloLicenseMIT",

Maybe the 7B Llama model is within reach... :thinking_emoji:replynovaRom 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I did use a tweaked nanoGPT to pretrain a 12M model on TinyStories (2Gbytes produced by GPT4), and results are pretty amazing. I've adapted it a bit on Wikipedia then, and it looks like a solid bullshit generator, much smarter than any smoothed n-gram model, and significantly smaller. My bet small LLMs will be predominant in multiple areas. My next goal is to reduce 7B llama2 to 10-100M without making it much dumber.replyoaguy1 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I also trained nanoGPT on TinyStories, produced about a 32M model. The results are amazing, especially considering I opted for a character-level model similar to the toy dataset in the repo. I\u2019m writing about the experience while also doing a deep dive into the code on medium (username oaguy1). Smaller LLMs are definitely worth considering with the right quality training data. Once I finish playing with TinyStories, I recently tweaked the Standardized Project Gutenberg Corpus (~11GB) to be more modern. Want to see what I can do with it with nanoGPT and then maybe Huggingface\u2019s libraries.replyRemmy 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Would love to read more about your time in NanoGPT. I've been getting familiar with it myself lately and it's still pretty much gibberish in the output with 16M, but the dataset is admittedly trash right now as well.replyGaggiX 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]>My next goal is to reduce 7B llama2 to 10-100M without making it much dumber.That is going to be hard as the 7B model was trained on 2T tokens. Maybe if you heavily restrict the range in which the model should operate.replyljlolel 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]1. It\u2019s faster and cheaper to train a smaller model2. Better than tokens is to train on probability distributions (distillation) and trees of probability distributionsreplypgbovine 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Your work is an inspiration as always!! My n00b question is: what do you think is currently the most practical path to running a reasonably-sized (doesn't have to be the biggest) LLM on a commodity linux server for hooking up to a hobby web app ... i.e., one without a fancy GPU. (Renting instances with GPUs on, say, Linode, is significantly more expensive than standard servers that host web apps.) Is this totally out of reach, or are approaches like yours (or others you know of) a feasible path forward?replyvikp 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I would use textsynth (https://bellard.org/ts_server/) or llama.cpp (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) if you're running on CPU. - I wouldn't use anything higher than a 7B model if you want decent speed. - Quantize to 4-bit to save RAM and run inference faster.Speed will be around 15 tokens per second on CPU (tolerable), and 5-10x faster with a GPU.replypedrovhb 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I've been playing with running some models on the free tier Oracle VM machines with 24GB RAM and Ampere CPU and it works pretty well with llama.cpp. It's actually surprisingly quick; speed doesn't scale too well with the number of threads on CPU, so even the 4 ARM64 cores on that VM, with NEON, run at a similar speed to my 24-core Ryzen 3850X (maybe about half reading speed). It can easily handle Llama 2 13B, and if I recall correctly I did manage to run a 30B model in the past too. Speed for the smaller ones is ~half reading speed or so.It's a shame the current Llama 2 jumps from 13B to 70B. In the past I tried running larger stuff by making a 32GB swap volume, but it's just impractically slow.replysummarity 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If you're running on Ampere, using llama.cpp is probably not ideal. While it's optimized for ARM, Ampere has native acceleration for workloads like this: https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/adf.ta...replybrucethemoose2 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Prompt ingestion is too slow on the Oracle VMs.Also its really tricky to even build llama.cpp with a BLAS library, to make prompt ingestion less slow. The Oracle Linux OpenBLAS build isnt detected ootb, and it doesn't perform well compared to x86 for some reason.LLVM/GCC have some kind of issue identifying the Ampere ARM architecture (march=native doesn't really work), so maybe this could be improved with the right compiler flags?replypedrovhb 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Not sure if that's still the case. I remember having trouble building it a couple of months ago, had to tweak the Makefile because iirc it assumed ARM64 <=> Mac, but I recently re-cloned the repo and started from scratch and it was as simple as `make DLLAMA_BLAS=1`. I don't think I have any special setup other than having installed the apt openblas dev package.replybrucethemoose2 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]IDK. A bunch of basic development packages like git were missing from my Ubuntu image when I tried last week, and I just gave up because it seemed like a big rabbit hole to go down.I can see the ARM64 versions on the Ubuntu web package list, so... IDK what was going on?On Oracle Linux, until I changed some env variables and lines in the makefile, the openblas build would \"work,\" but it was actually silently failing and not using OpenBLAS.replyjvickers 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Is it any easier when using Ubuntu on ARM Oracle servers?replybrucethemoose2 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Nah, I tried Ubuntu too.The OpenBLAS package was missing on ARM, along with some other dependencies I needed for compilation.At the end of the day, even with many tweaks and custom compilation flags, the instance was averaging below 1 token/sec as a Kobold Horde host, which is below the threshold to even be allowed as a llm host.replyY_Y 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It might be more expensive to get a GPU instance but at a guess I'd say it's more cost-effective considering that the CPU computation will be less efficient and take much longer. I bet someone's done this out with real numbers, I just haven't seen it.replyfranga2000 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This only matters if you're scaling to meet demand and demand is higher than your spare resources, which often isn't the case for hobby projects. The 10\u20ac/mo VPS I've had for over 6 years now still has a few cores and GBs or RAM spare, so running a small model on the CPU for a personal project that only me and a few friends occasionally use wouldn't cost me a cent more.replyimmibis 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]FYI, the going rate for \"smallest possible VPS\" is now more like 3\u20ac/mo.replybg24 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It depends on your use case, correct? If you do not have a heavy inferencing requirement, then CPU is good enough.replymadduci 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Do you think it's possible also to create a trainer in pure C, instead of using python?replyimmibis 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Of course it's possible. The question is whether anyone finds it worth doing.ML algorithms are, at their core, not particularly complicated code. But they are still tricky code, because if you get them wrong you will find that you spent 500 GPU-years turning random numbers that cause the model to output gibberish into other random numbers that cause the model to output different yet semantically identical gibberish.Writing them in a more abstract languages has advantages - like automatic differentiation. You could explicitly tell the computer how to compute the output and its derivative, or you could tell the computer how to compute the output, and let it also compute the derivative by itself.Having all your weights in one object is also awfully convenient; you can write something like `weights -= error * deriv * learning_rate` instead of iterating over each individual weight (and a large model contains many different sets of weights, not just a single NxMxPxQ matrix)This is good for the rapid iteration that ML research demands. However, once you have selected a model, I'm sure you can get performance advantages by coding it in a low level and eliminating inefficiencies. For example, you should be able to use the weight update equation from above by using fused multiply-accumulate, and the Python framework might not realize that.replyDougBTX 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This is C++ rather than C, but a substantial portion of PyTorch is written in C++, and they provide a C++ interface:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_frontend.htmlIn other words, you can absolutely use PyTorch without Python.replykarpathy 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]In principle easy and possible, just not exactly useful. Would just involve adding the backward pass.

I particularly love the idea of being able to build webapps with local inference.With optimisation, research into ways to make smaller models, partial downloads, and then the opportunity to use WebGPU we potentially have the start of an exciting new way to build privet local LLM based apps.It's never going to be up to the same capabilities of hosted LLMs on massive clusters of top end GPUs, but there are so many use cases that this sort of thing will enable.replySeanAnderson 12 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I got the strangest output from your first link.

She loved to play outside in the park. One day, while she was playing, she saw a black bird flying in the sky. It was a beautiful bird with yellow wings.Lily ran to her friend, Timmy, and said, \"Look, Timmy! A pretty bird!\" Timmy smiled and said, \"I see it! It's black and black.\"Suddenly, the sky turned dark and it started to rain. Lily and Timmy ran to a shelter and waited for the rain to stop. When it finally stopped, they ran back to Lily's house. They were happy to be safe and dry. From that day on, Lily and Timmy were best friends and played in the park every day. Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big temple. Many people went to the temple to talk to each other. One day, a little boy named Tim went to the temple with his mom.Tim saw a pretty red ball at the temple.

That's the nature of exploratory research.Having said that, once you find a model that works well, it tends to gets its advances incorporated into the next versions of the frameworks (so Tensorflow now has primitives like CNN, GRU and TransformerEncoder), as well as getting specific hardware implementations optimized for speed at the expense of generality (like this one).replycjbprime 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yes, since it's single-threaded.replyWaterluvian 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]As someone who doesn\u2019t work with languages like C, what\u2019s the appeal of \u201cin one file\u201d or \u201cheader only\u201d?

Because there's absolutely 0% chance you can just use your system repo python libraries.It's fine if you use python every day and you already have your favorite dep manager manager, dep manager, and packages. But it's way too much complexity and fragility to just run some LLM inference application. Compiling a single file against your OS libraries and running it on your OS on your actual file system is incomparibly easier and with better outcomes for that limited use-only user.replyWaterluvian 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah Python is a disaster for dependency management.

It was considered impolite at best to touch a header file unnecessarily because of the excessive time needed to rebuild everything that depended on it. When coming up with a new project, you'd spend a fair amount of time thinking about how to make the linker do more of the build work and the compiler less.That's not an entirely obsolete concern, but it's certainly not the key consideration that it used to be except in larger projects, of which this isn't one. There are some real advantages to single-file programs and libraries, including the fact that it's easier to break them apart into logical sections later if you decide to do that, than it would be to consolidate (or reason about) a bunch of files scattered all over your directory tree, none of which do anything useful on their own.replywtarreau 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]In fact, editors used to be one such concern, when they were limited or getting extremely slow with large files. Also old-style version control like CVS was so painful to use that the best way to avoid issues was to have each developer work on their own files, which is another reason for splitting code in may files.replyvariadix 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It\u2019s still a significant concern for C++, you just can\u2019t get around it because of templates.

    "content": "HomeElectric CarsWith The 745-mile Solid-state Battery, Toyota Just Became A Force To Reckon WithBYJAMES O'NEILPUBLISHED 2 DAYS AGOToyota has just made a dazzling leap back into EVs after a long absence and it just became a threat to all other EVmakers out there.Toyota A front-angle shot of the 2023 Toyota bZ4X in Metallic Gray shade. SUMMARYToyota has been secretly developing a solid-state battery for EVs with a range of 745 miles and a charge time of 10 minutes, which could revolutionize the industry.The battery will provide EVs with the same driving range as traditional vehicles, eliminating the need for frequent charging stops during long trips.While Toyota has been a proponent of hydrogen cars, this breakthrough in EV batteries suggests a shift in the company's approach to the post-ICE future.Perhaps we\u2019ve gotten too accustomed to the tech-bro approach to corporate PR, in which companies loudly trumpet every half-baked idea that may or may not fizzle into anticlimactic failure. Today, a company waiting until a concept is totally finished and ready for deployment seems almost quaint. While Toyota has hitherto seemed staunchly opposed to EVs, its research and development department has been developing what may be the biggest breakthrough in EV batteries away from the prying eyes of publicists: a solid-state car battery with a range of 745 miles and a charge time of ten minutes. (For those who prefer metric, that\u2019s a range of 1200 kilometers and a charge time of six hectoseconds.)For the first time in the history of mass-production EVs, a battery-powered car will have the same driving range as one with an engine and a gas tank. Anyone listening carefully will hear EV-driving dads breathe a sigh of relief as they contemplate how they won\u2019t need to pull over and pry their children away from convenience store candy shelves every two hours while they wait for the car to charge. The great family road trip hasn\u2019t gotten any more bearable in the post-engine era, but may get a bit more cheapskate-friendly.RELATED:What Toyota\u2019S New Solid-State Battery Means For HydrogenWhat Is A Solid-State Battery?ToyotaInspection of a battery research centerA solid-state battery is quite simple to explain. It stores its electrical charge in a solid electrolyte (other types of batteries use a liquid or paste-like one). They\u2019re commonly used in small devices like pacemakers, RFIDs, and other things that demand little electricity. Because they have a very high energy density compared to other battery types (that is, they can store more electricity than other batteries of the same size), solid-state batteries seem like a natural fit for electric cars. But they don\u2019t do well in cold weather, tend to weaken quickly after repeatedly getting charged and drained, are particularly costly, and have other issues that prevent them from going into every laptop, smartphone, and car.The rise of EVs has made battery research a lot more profitable than it was a mere ten years ago, and scientists have been working on overcoming the shortcomings of solid-state batteries. Toyota is the first company that has come out and said it may have solved the range and battery weight problems.RELATED:How Solid-State Batteries Are Addressing The Limitations Of Lithium-Ion BatteriesWhat Does This Mean For Toyota\u2019s Hydrogen Cars?ToyotaA front three-quarter action shot of a Toyota Mirai on the roadToyota has been more devoted to hydrogen cars than practically other auto company. Indeed, Toyota has been so enthusiastic about hydrogen that at times it seemed like a passion project of recently-departed CEO Akio Toyoda. The Toyota Mirai has become the de-facto flagship of hydrogen cars. It is about as middle-of-the-road as one can get without making a crossover instead of a sedan. Indeed, it cannot be a coincidence that Toyota designed the Mirai to look like a close relation to the Camry. Putting hydrogen fuel cells into such a deliberately normal car essentially makes refueling the only difficulty for sales.Toyota has recently announced a hydrogen variant of its Crown luxury sedan, which will be sold only in Japan (JDM enthusiasts, take note!). For quite some time, it appeared that Toyota was one of the few automakers trying to fight a valiant crusade for a fuel that could barely be found outside the confines of a small handful of cities worldwide. Toyota is also strongly pushing the use of hydrogen for commercial trucking. While it previously seemed like Toyota was betting that hydrogen would supersede batteries, it is now apparent that the company is taking the same approach to the post-ICE future as other manufacturers.As the public gets more comfortable with EVs, most companies have begun developing both battery and hydrogen-powered cars. A quick reading of most corporate press releases about hydrogen cars shows that nearly every automaker says something about how no single-car fuel will solve the energy crisis. On the subject of hydrogen fuel cells, corporate copywriters seem particularly fond of the phrase \u201cjust one piece of the puzzle.\u201d It\u2019s almost a requirement to mention the metaphorical puzzle at some point in a hydrogen press release.RELATED:Here'S How Mazda And Subaru Could Benefit From Toyota'S New Solid-State Battery TechnologyToyota's Lackluster EV History Makes This A SurpriseToyotaFront 3/4 view of a white 2010 Toyota Rav4 Demonstration EV driving at sunsetPerhaps Toyota\u2019s apparent hesitance to introduce a battery EV into its current lineup comes from the failure of its previous attempt. The electric Rav4, most recently sold from 2012 to 2014, had a range of 103 miles. In other words, the car could drive about as far as a gasoline vehicle with the fuel gauge needle hovering perilously close to E. While no one noted any egregious mechanical faults with the electric RAV4, its range was too short for even the most convenient of commutes. After this less-than-exhilarating dalliance with EVs, Toyota seemed to quietly give up on them until 2022 when it introduced the bZ4x crossover SUV. Aside from having a barcode instead of a name, the bZ4x is a reassuringly ordinary vehicle with a driving range of around 250 miles (the precise range depends on trim level), which puts it on par with most other EVs today. Given this apathetic approach to EVs, no one expected Toyota to announce that it had solved the battery range problem.However, as is Toyota\u2019s way, the company is not rushing a long-range BEV into production. Instead, the first vehicles with this battery are expected to be hybrids instead of all-electric vehicles. Toyota claims it will be ready for sale in 2027 or 2028. While it may seem that Toyota is obstinately refusing to put \"the good tech\" into production cars, this long-term release plan will probably prove wise. Putting the battery into hybrid vehicles instead of immediately making it the sole power source may be a cushion of reliability. If the battery doesn\u2019t hold up to the abuse of daily driving despite Toyota's famously rigorous testing, the internal-combustion backup will ensure that the vehicle nevertheless has a better driving range than the 2012 electric Rav4.RELATED:Explained: Solid-State Batteries Vs Lithium-Ion BatteriesToyota Has Consistently Made Cutting-Edge Designs Available In Its Most Sensible VehiclesToyotaA rear three-quarter view of a 2023 Toyota Prius being driven. While other automakers reserve their more unusual powertrains for halo cars and enthusiast-approved coupes, Toyota has a long (if understated) history of putting groundbreaking designs into practical vehicles. This is the company that introduced the world to hybrid vehicles with the Prius, a car that remains the most determinedly mundane commuting module to carry a novelty powertrain. (Obviously, hybrids aren\u2019t a novelty today, but they were at the time.) The company also produced what may be the world's only mid-engine minivan\u2014 which required one to dislodge the front seat and open a floor hatch when performing an oil change.RELATED:Honda Might Have Figured Out The Solution For The Biggest Solid-State Battery ProblemToyota May Have Come Out Of Nowhere To Take Over EVsToyota PressroomFront 3/4 shot of the fully electric 2023 Toyota bZ4X.Toyota\u2019s promises about this battery seem almost too good to be true. Even Tesla, the company leading the EV vanguard, hasn\u2019t managed to produce a vehicle that has the same driving range as a car with an inline-four and a full tank of gas. The prospect of a ten-minute charge time is just as astonishing as an EV that can allegedly drive from Chicago to Philadelphia without charging midway.

    "content": "tl;drThe full storyWhat I\u2019m doingmy monitoring systemscreenshotsConclusionThis maybe seems to be a weird post, especially for those who don\u2019t live in Italy, because here in Italy there\u2019s the common belief that the abilites of a worker, usually are less considered than the qualifies that it has. Or simply the employers don\u2019t ask \u201cwhat you are able to do?\u201d, instead of \u201cwhat are your credentials/studies\u201d.Unfortunaly this post will not totally debunk this myth, at least for me, because I think that in Italy the work market is not as healthy as other (north) european States, but I just want to give a little bit of hope to my fellow citizens.tl;drA security company asked me to work with them after they saw and read the posts on this blog.The full storySome months ago I was riding a bike uphill (I\u2019m a cyclist) and a guy overtake me, so I decided to follow him during the ascent, just to chat a little. And by talking about technolgy and cycling, I discovered that he is the CEO of some interesting companies that are bringing tech in the sport environment, more precisely he\u2019s building some smart sensors that you can found inside the t-shirt of some football big players (like the Italian national team, Inter, Lazio etc\u2026). And I found we had similar ideas about the digital rights and the fundamental importance of the technology nowadays, so we kept in contact via social networks.Few months after this curious meet, and after he read some of these posts blog, especially this one My network home setup - v4.0, and he decided to write me a message saying: \u201cHi Giulio, how are you? You know that you have the same passion I had when I was younger: the networking?! Have you ever thought of making this passion a job?\u201d. So I replied: \u201cHi xxx, thanks but why are you asking me this?\u201d, and he said: \u201cBecause I can help you in this (make my passion a job), wait few days and a friend of mine will call you\u201d.The day after one guy (the actual CEO of the company where I\u2019m working) called me and he asked me to have a job interview because he found my posts and abilities very interesting, but what surprised me is that he didn\u2019t ask me \u201cwhat are your studies, what is your age, what are your references, etcc\u2026\u201d he was interested in what I\u2019m able to do and what I think about the networking/internet. Full stop.So we made this job interview and he offered me a very interesting contract with a right salary. So I took some days to make my decision, because I was a scared that I wasn\u2019t up to the job and I had also another job proposal \u201con background\u201d, but in the end I said yes.And I think it was one of my best decision ever, because the work environment and my colleagues are fabulous, I like a lot what I\u2019m doing and it\u2019s very interesting to improve my skill, learn new stuff and make new experiences.What I\u2019m doingI\u2019m working something like a DevOps or a SysAdmin, I took the Fortinet NS4 certification, I\u2019m doing the NS5 and the work my company is to build (or rebuild) the datacenters of other companies from scratch, so I have to program the network. Another branch of the company is doing the \u201cmanual stuff\u201d, like certify the cables, wiring the switches, build the datacenter rooms/racks, etc\u2026 and we also install the security surveillance appliances and VoIP phones.my monitoring systemBeside the network job, like install new firewalls/switches/servers/UPS/PBX/etc.., what the company wanted from me was also a \u201cmonitoring system\u201d for the network appliances of our clients. More precisely a monitoring system that can monitor lots of different stuff/hardware and sends alerts when something happens, like a server disk is full or a IP surveillance camera is offline or a WAN is loosing lots of packets, and so on\u2026So what can be the best monitoring system than Grafana and Prometheus like I\u2019m already doing at my home?!I knew that using Prometheus as a database would have been very tricky, because I should have use lots of different exporter (way to write in the database), like original exporters and SNMP exporters. And that I should have created all my customs Grafana dashboards. There are lots of way simply monitoring system like PRTG or Zabbix but no one is fully customizable, flexible and powerful (\u2026and open source) as the coupling of Prometheus + Grafana. Considering also the alert system that\u2019s integrated into Grafana.So we made some consideration about the timings, the hardware costs and remote operational, then we chosen the hardware enclosure and the business model, and finally I started to build up the whole system in a one 19\u201d rack unit that inside has:a VPN made with WireGuard on a Mikrotik 750 with OpenWrta Raspberry PI 4B with Grafana and Prometheus for the monitoring systema Raspberry PI 3B with Pi-Hole and Unbound to offer to the clients a privacy focused DNSa USB hub to use only one external power supplysome shorts USB cablessome custom Ethernet ports and cablesAnd with the help of my colleagues, that are way skilled than me in the hardware stuff, I built the first unit!But images speak better than words, so this is the first full system built:The stuff inside are taped to the bottom with a strong, heat resistant, bi-adesive tape:And this is the unit finally installed inside a client rack:But I think you wonder why SYSMI name, rightly\u2026 well, my company name is SYSTI, so SYSMI is the name + monitoring = SYSMI. And SYSDNS for the Pi-hole DNS.Finally, this solution with the Raspberry PIs reuires also very low power to operate (usually less than 20W) and it doesn\u2019t heat, so I can use passive cooling and I don\u2019t bother the clients (bills) with a 150/200W power system like a normal x86 server.And last, here there are the screenshots of some of the first dashboards:screenshotsTwo Fortigate in HA:A Synology:A Windows machine on a ESXi server:The connectivity:The Pi-Hole dashboard:Some example rules:And an alert email when something is triggered, and then resolved (for a client the sender is not \u2018SYSMI\u2019 but the name of the client, in order to know which client is having issue):And there\u2019re lots of other dashboards but for now I think these screenshots are sufficient.ConclusionThis is the first \u201cinteraction\u201d in this environment for me, and I\u2019ve done all in 3/4 months, so the things can be improved a lot, and I\u2019ll do it in the future, especially with the software. But I think that as a first approach, thanks also to my colleagues, I can be quite satisfied.In the future I will write more about the software, the issues and other inconvenience I will come across, for now if you have any question just ask in the comments!",

If you haven't had the opportunity to work on large-scale projects, you might lack impressive accomplishments or credentials to showcase. This issue can compound over time, leaving you stuck in positions that are less rewarding than even mediocre jobs, regardless of your true capabilities or the quality of your work.Some people say that you can build open source projects or build products to show what you have. Balancing such efforts with a full-time job can be challenging, as these undertakings can consume most, if not all, of your free time. This creates a vicious cycle where you're continuously overextending yourself just to prove your worth. It's a demanding situation that can impact both your professional and personal life.replylubujackson 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Referring to the \"small startup experience\" not mattering - I would say it is almost like an alternate track as an engineer.I have trouble landing interviews at FAANGs with 15+ years as an eng. and successful acquisitions as a founder - but those don't mean anything if you don't have direct knowledge of certain tools to handle scale or experience guiding projects across departments, etc. Which makes sense for any role past junior, since part of the value you bring is experience and only some of your experience is directly applicable. Vaguely being competent doesn't really move the needle.On the other hand, I've heard stories of people getting hired from a FAANG going to a startup and not able to shift their mindset to a \"make it work\" approach, so the challenge goes both ways.replydasil003 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I've also had the experience of failing FAANG interviews after being very successful at smaller scale. Since then I've made the leap, and I can tell you that experience in the 10-100 developer range is extremely valuable and can make you very upwardly mobile once you get a foot in the door. People that have spent their entire career in big corporations often have a lot of assumed constraints based on groupthink and the vagaries of whatever specific org leaf nodes they've been exposed to. Often they will have worked for years under bosses with no real clue about the actual decision making process and strategy behind their work. It's extremely hard to develop an end-to-end understanding and strategic viewpoint in these environments. Startups offer much more opportunity to learn the big picture and the strategic considerations behind different functions. Obviously anyone can claim to be doing a startup\u2014there's a lot of the blind leading the blind, and people playing house\u2014but if you find one with an interesting vision, a bit of traction, and good colleagues you can learn lessons that will translate well to leadership at big tech.Coming in the front door will be hard though, because recruiters and the first layer of technical interviewers will likely not have context to judge your 15+ years of experience. Look for referrals and directly talking to hiring managers. Also, read some writing from notable SV management writers like Will Larson and Camille Fournier, this will help you learn some of the shibboleths and how hiring managers think. Finally, if you don't have legit scale-up experience, look for that first. There's a range of companies with engineering teams of all sizes which can provide good stepping stones for learning as well as hireability optics.replygiovannibonetti 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> On the other hand, I've heard stories of people getting hired from a FAANG going to a startup and not able to shift their mindset to a \"make it work\" approach, so the challenge goes both ways.But at least they get the job, so they can try to learn. Hence it doesn't go both ways.replyHermitian909 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Referring to the \"small startup experience\" not mattering - I would say it is almost like an alternate track as an engineer.It can be but doesn't have to be. A lot of people prefer to hire folks with some small startup experience because such people almost always better at thinking about businesses holistically. Many people who spend their entire careers at big companies can only reason about their little slice (lots of bad takes on businesses here).A common way to make VP of engineering at big tech is the following 5 job hops:1. Manager at big tech2. Manager at startup -> promotion to director3. Director at big tech4. Director at startup -> promotion to VP5. VP at big techThe problem comes when someone gets too senior with relevant experience at scale. I (generally) can't hire someone with 15 years of experience who's never worked at scale. They're going to be bored out of their mind with mid-level work but simultaneously I can't actually trust them to not screw up something in senior+ roles, either technically or socially.replyryandrake 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Titles in startups really don't map meaningfully to titles in BigTech. You can be called a VP in a startup with 20 people under you in the org chart. That empire size is equivalent to \"second level manager\" in a FAANG, and FAANGs know this. When FAANG acquires a startup with 20 people, MAYBE the CEO gets a nice title, but most of the startup's acquired employees get Senior Worker Bee titles.replyHermitian909 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'd hoped the pre-requisite that titles matched duties was implicitly understood in the message, sorry!But you can absolutely come into an engineering role at a company with 40 engineers (40 person org charts to director at BigTech), grow into leadership of a 200+ person engineering (charts to vp) and then go back to BigTech for bigger bucks.replyghaff 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's probably like a lot of other transitions to related but different careers. In my experience, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't--which probably says that as a prospective employer (and employee) there is an additional risk factor.replysam2426679 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Probably an unpopular, \"grass is always greener\" opinion, but this is why leetcode-style interviews can be a good thing at FAANG. Anyone with time and an internet connection can gain experience with data structures and algorithms via leetcode, whereas it's much harder to get hands-on experience with scaling real transactions-per-second on your own. And, as contrived as leetcode is, it does measure something about your ability to grok how code and infra scale against time and space.replytough 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]How reasonable is for a non-us based developer to even try?FAANG positions in Europe are OK-ish but not such a deal breaker to me to dedicate so much time to -useless- stuff, I'd rather build cool shitreplyitronitron 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The people I know (US-based developers) hired by FAANG were all very recently out of college, graduate school, or academia.

You don\u2019t see how your tool gets used, leading to DevEx issues with the project, people asking with varying levels of politeness why you built things that way.But at the end of the day the feedback is only so valuable, even when it comes with PRs.replyPaul-Craft 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Not just that. Engineers get pigeonholed into tech stacks as well. It's almost as if companies (recruiters, really) think a senior engineer can't learn another programming language or something.

I recognise that these companies have made a lot of money, but how? I remember the day of BeOS, it was technically 15 years ahead and Microsoft killed it (just as an example), the same company that years later tried to kill Linux and killed Nokia. Google with their motto \"Don't be evil\" ... sure, just collect personal data in every possible way and sell it against your will. Yes, they have also done many positive things like Golang or Android for example, but when they see that they are losing the grip (and monopoly) on the project, they switch to something else (Flutter ... Fuchsia). The real revolution (apart from the Internet) of the last decades has been open source, without it we wouldn't have *BSD, Mariadb, PostgresQL, Linux, Android, dozens of languages, databases, knowledge sharing. and with it freedom : freedom to choose, freedom to learn, to collaborate with other people around the globe for the benifits if not all, at least many. In my opinion, the open source philosophy has done more for human evolution than all the big companies put together (and their money stacked in foreing countries to not pay taxes).replydarkclouds 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]My understanding, but maybe its fake news over here in the UK, is that Jobs dropped out, Zuckerberg dropped out, Gates dropped out, Brin and Page both dropped out. Cant comment on the other two MS blokes, or the other bloke who co founded Apple.But getting a decent education here in the UK, where you dont get beaten up by teachers, in my experience is quite difficult. I even dropped out of one schools six form to enroll in another six form, perhaps demonstrating my willingness to learn, but even one of those courses was sabotaged.To be honest I think the mentality of the british empire was and might still be pervasive with state school education, viewed more as an institution to contain people of a certain age than a place of learning.Perhaps that is why law is not taught to everyone at school even in a TL;DR fashion?replyecshafer 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]My larger point is there is a very big difference between dropping out of an elite institution just before the finish line because you think you have a billion dollar company on your hands, and just dropping out. Even if MS, Facebook and Google all failed Brinn, Zuckerberg, and Gates would still have been able to walk get a job probably. They didn't drop out because they failed out, they willingly left to pursue their ideas, and were otherwise top notch students.replysimonw 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I wrote about this a while ago: https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/17/standing-out/If you have a dusty old blog with just a single technical post on it from 2012 which demonstrates that you know how to code, know how to write and know how to solve a technical problem... that will STILL give you a solid advantage against other candidates, at least in the early stages of the hiring process.When hiring, the very first filter you need to apply is \"can this person actually do the work\". That's what FizzBuzz is about!A blog post (or a dusty old GitHub repo) is a great way to jump past that filter.replyloumf 19 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I\u2019ve been blogging for almost 20 years.

I think we have many problems in these modern IT times ... The first is that we are drowning in new IT technologies that are released every day and it is impossible to keep up with them ... Many languages, frameworks, tools ... After 25 years in this field, I am very sceptical when I read a CV on LinkedIn of a person who is an \"expert\" in 10 or 20 different technologies or languages (it is simply impossible). On the other hand, we have companies looking for \"gurus\" in several areas with many years of experience... just unrealistic expectations. Apart from a limited minority of true geniuses, all of us mere mortals need time and projects and work and a lot of failures to develop expertise in any field. On the other hand, in the 'real' world of work, it is not enough just to be technically competent. You need a lot of other skills that are equally if not more important: willingness to learn, ability to evaluate technologies based on requirements and constraints, integrity, honesty, self-organisation, curiosity, ingenuity ... logic. At the end of the day, it is a balancing act between technology, resources, money, time constraints and human relations, not just writing code or knowing everything about one or more tools that may become obsolete in a week.replyericmcer 19 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]It does feel kinda overwhelming.

Now there is the bandwagon of javascript frameworks: React, Vue, Svelte, Next, Nuxt and so on. It is impossible to keep up and it is also impossible that all these new technologies will be maintained in the long term. I remember the rise of Java years ago ... Java everywhere: Java applets on the web, Java on the desktop, Java as an application server and how it ended? Java is, in my opinion, one of the most convoluted and impenetrable languages ever created, but when you work alone as a freelancer, as in my case, you don't have the time and the resources to embrace and follow every new technology that is marketed as a revolution and the future, because at the end of the month you have to send the invoices to your clients to earn and live, and you have to have produced some results that work for them in the \"real\" world. I have used Drupal for a few projects in the past: the main problem? Every major release that broke the API backwards compatibility and this means you have to refactor all your plugins and custom code, many times without any new direct benefit to the end user who, of course, was not available to spend money because some internals change every year and, for him, on the surface nothing changed.replyfinitestateuni 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You realize that Ada and Objective C predate Object Pascal, and Erlang came out in the same year as it, right?I would worry less about new ways of doing the same thing and more about client generation/retention.

I had a similar experience where having a public website with published extensions for the server that my future employer was using helped me get a job there, but, I'd like to point out that in both our cases it wasn't the blog/website alone that helped us get the job, but a personal connection. In your case it was meeting that CEO on a bike, who then made a personal recommendation. In my case it was my general reputation as an active member of a community where the job was posted, that I applied to.What the blog did was to make it easy for the CEO to get to know you without talking to you more. And for me it was my code examples. So that works if you find a job where your ideas fit, but it can also work against you to find any other job that may expect a different mindset. Just recently I had an interview that also came about due to my reputation in the community, after I posted there that I was looking for work. But they desperately wanted to see code too, and the only thing I had to show was almost 15 years old or older, in a language that is not well known, because all my recent work was not public, and I didn't keep code from work on my personal devices. I haven't heard back from them yet.replyswores 20 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Minor feedback that you're welcome to ignore: I found reading your comment a little bit slower & more annoying because of your lack of upper case letters for sentence starts.

On a sidenote, once you earned the jobtitle this way in italy, it is easier (but still tricky) to get it abroad as well.Once I tried to go abroad sometimes I got asked credentials (and subsequently bombed) and sometimes not, wich guaranteed me jobs in Switzerland and France.Steer away from anglosaxon jobs though, they do enforce the control and most likely they\u2019ll carch your bluff.last suggestion: shoot for the highest possible pay and change job often enough to beat inflation several times over in 5 years.

I think it's better to rely on second hand enterprise hardware if you're looking for something cheap.replynfriedly 20 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]FWIW, Raspberry Pi availability is starting to recover, and they do have the ability to boot off of a USB drive (including SSDs) or a network server these days.That said even SD cards are probably fine if you're not doing a ton of writes. (And it looked like a USB drive was attached to one of the PIs in the picture. So, presumably the important data is going there.)You're not wrong that second hand enterprise hardware would be more reliable but, honestly, I think this setup is fine for what they were trying to accomplish - especially if they already had some of the hardware laying around.replyDaril 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I have used 4 RaspberryPi (3 and 4) for a few years for various needs : Gitea server, Home Assistant server, Syncthing main repository, Borg backup repository, Wireguard VPN and network gateway between 2 LANs. I haven't encountered any problems with the SD card, if you buy the class 10 SD cards (the same you would use for your dashcam and security camera). One option is to use the F2FS file system on the card (I did this on my Raspberry) or, as others have suggested, use an SSD or NVMe drive. The main problems I encountered with the Raspberry 4 were heat dissipation (use a metal case with direct contact to the CPU without a fan, this is the best option in my tests) and external USB 3 drives interfering with the wifi. The latter seems to be a known design issue. Considering all this and the prices, if you don't really need the Raspberry's ability to control external hardware via GPio, and if you want to keep the same network design (separate devices), there are many mini PCs with passive dissipation, 2 or more Nics, lots of RAM and SSD support, for a similar or lower price all considered ... or buy one or two real servers and virtualise everything with Proxmox.replygiuliomagnifico 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Now they aren't expensive (like 6-12 months ago), one RPi -the one with the database- is relying on the SSD (so no issue) and the other is using RAM logs so the data written to the SD card are minimal.

Excited to share cc.dev after months of work and refinement.The idea for this product came from trying to do email marketing for my side project, CubeDesk, a site where Rubik's Cube enthusiasts can time themselves, race with one another, train algorithms \u2014 it's a fun niche!With over 40k users, sending even a single campaign was becoming expensive with MailChimp. I knew AWS SES would be much cheaper, but it\u2019s just an API with none of the other necessities you need for a robust email marketing platform.Beyond cost, I was also frustrated with having to make sure my database was always in sync with MailChimp and the audience schema they enforced. If I wanted to email every user who had completed 10 solves, that would be a whole ordeal and eat up hours of my day.So, I started (and am now launching):https://cc.devcc.dev connects directly to your database and lets you write SQL queries to target your audience. It's backed by AWS SES, so the cost to send emails is significantly less than what you're used to seeing. Combined with a template builder, media management, and campaign monitoring, cc.dev is meant to be your final destination whenever you need to send marketing emails to your users.Would love to hear your feedback on this!

No freaking way! But assume for an instant that this would be ok. For this, your target audience again must be tech-savvy.Step 3: Create an email template using MJML... again, for tech-savvy people, not for the average digital marketeer...Step 4: Review and send... ok, pretty basic..English -> SQL. Here you got me confused. For steps 1, 2 and 3, your audience must be tech-savvy. This feature doesn't make any sense for tech-savvy people. It only makes sense for the average marketeer in a small team (or solopreneur) who doesn't know SQL. But this guy would never get through steps 1, 2 and 3!See my point?A tech-savvy person in a tight budget would develop his own solution. Imho, not your target.An average digital marketeer or solopreneur who doesn't know how to code and is in a tight budget could be your audience. But for that, steps 1-3 must be no-code/for dummies.The greatest thing about the idea is \"email marketing cheaper\".replykashnote 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The target market is someone who1. is tech-savvy and runs an app/service with a bunch of users2. has tried existing emailing platforms and feel that they're too expensive3. wants full freedom of who they target their emails toA tech-savvy person could make their own solution, and that's what I wanted to do with Heimdall CubeDesk, but it's surprisingly difficult and time-consuming, which gave me the idea for this service.The English -> SQL thing is just a fun feature I added since I'm excited about LLMs. Comes in handy for folks who aren't SQL experts (like me).Totally agree on the security concerns.

We do a lot of targeted and dynamic emails to our users based on their role and progress through our courses, and it\u2019s a pain to not only synchronize the database with the mail provider, but to agree on a system for capturing the state of the user that works with the platform - we\u2019ve ended up creating a complex system of tags that has to be maintained across both systems.Re: non technical users, one idea would be an ability to save \u201caudiences\u201d using smaller SQL queries, that way non-technical collaborators could easily send a campaign to a well-defined group of users, and update the group definition once instead of across all your emails.If you could infer the structure of the connected database automatically and control which tables are visible in the product, people might find that really helpful too (check out Metabase as an example product that does a great job at querying data sources with UI and raw SQL)replyimafish 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Also target audience here.

So while you should absolutely make sure this is done properly and advise your users not just to expose their databases willy-nilly, don't get psyched out by folks telling you it's a hard no to have to connect a DB directly. Users want this, will pay for it, and you're wise for doing it.replytrvz 9 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> Users want thisThe customers of those users absolutely do not want this.

A rube-goldberg style setup probably presents its own risks, but personally I just use AWS SES for my transactional/marketing emails and it's a one-way pipe that doesn't present any significant risks as far as I can see.reply8organicbits 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Using a public facing database, but using an IP address allow-list to restrict access is pretty secure. cc should publish the IP addresses they use.replykashnote 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It\u2019s listed on the Data page! No need to open the database up to the whole internet. Just whitelist one IP.replysakopov 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Doesn't matter. The database still is on a public subnet on customer's network. All it takes is for someone to jack up some kind of white list or access rule and the entire database is exposed. It's an attack vector. You can't do this nearly as easily when the database is in a private subnet w/ no access to internet.replyscrose 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I mostly agree, but do want to emphasize that it really depends and there are multiple ways to secure this that range in complexity and maintenance overhead.The top thing that comes to mind is creating a separate \u2018read replica\u2019 DB that logically replicates target table(s) from the source DB, creates a materialized view with a subset of the replicated data in the replica db, and then exposes only the materialized view to a specific 3rd party user.That way you:1) Run your primary db in a private subnet \u2014 addressing your concern with ip whitelisting2) Run the replica in a public subnet with extremely limited access(ip-whitelisting and limited access controls to data).This is definitely a more complex setup to reason about and creates more moving parts that can fall out of sync, but it does greatly decrease the blast radius of a breach, and for some orgs, that may be a worthwhile trade-off. In my opinion, the OP would probably benefit from some basic security walkthroughs on these different implementations to help engineering teams get onboarded/make a better case for their solution if they hit friction with legal or security teams.reply8organicbits 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I believe the alternative is a VPN, secure tunnel, authenticated proxy, or similar. Those also have accidental failure modes that would permit access to the DB regardless of which subnet it's in. I'd consider each of those as a second factor, in addition to the DB password.replyTZubiri 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Right. It reminds me of SetVar and GetVar as a solution to exposing statereplylmm 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Any serious database nowadays uses TLS and client certificates, at which point \"exposing\" the database is using the exact same crypto library that a VPN or jump host or what have you would use, and is just as secure.replynlh 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Second devil's advocate here: I know this isn't necessarily \"good\" in terms of security, but it's a very common pattern for higher-level tools these days to connect directly to databases. A LOT of marketing/analytics tools support this seemingly because users want this (see: Customer.IO, Looker, etc.)So again, I'm not saying you're wrong in that this might be a bad security practice, but OP is not alone in taking this approach and many SaaS vendors are seeing success and getting users because of it. So OP is going down a trodden path.replytansan 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This feels like a very small step up from just doing everything in my codebase.My SES is already setup. I have templating for emails already. I can query my DB using my ORM without grant additional access. I guess I get the benefits of your UI for monitoring.I'm really not sure if the net positive is large enough for me to consider the solution.replyygouzerh 29 minutes ago | prev | next [\u2013]The frontend of the website is quite nice, how did you built it ?replyedmundsauto 6 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Honestly, you might be in the small part of SaaS well positioned to offer free trials.

Just enough to have told their boss and gotten kudos.replylxe 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Bravo. You found a market niche!

Asking people to open their database up to you, sketchy and dangerous.replykashnote 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Very legitimate concern and one I've been thinking about a lot. Honestly, I think the best way to address this is to just go open source, which I'm totally open to. I think once I've validated the idea a bit and know it's something people are interested in, I'll focus on this issue and come up with a solution (whether it's open sourcing or something else)replyCableNinja 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Going open source will not solve your problems. The issue is that youre asking customers to open database access to you/your company. The reason why the method youve chosen isnt already out there is because of all the implications it has.You better have one hell of a security team to ensure youre locked down tighter than a ducks ass. Look at how many data breaches there have been, even in the past year.The solution is to either make an SDK or API as already suggested by others, and giving customers endpoints to manage their lists.replykashnote 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Definitely taking all the security measures I can, but you're right, things can go wrong. I do encourage (and would like to enforce) that db credentials provided should have very limited read access to only the tables/columns that the user wants to query.Having said that, it's totally understandable that some orgs won't want do open up their db. The idea with going open source would be that they can host the platform in their VPC so that their data is never leaving the premises.Not against having an SDK or API at all, but I would need to think about would work because the whole syncing issue is one that I'm focused on addressing here.replyExuma 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm not a security expert, but at the very least if I were you make your docs very good for people who dont want to wade through 1000 different documentation to find how to very simply create a read-only user with access to specific table + columns. Or better yet even, how to create a read only view with ONLY the email/name and not any other PII, and then give access to that.replyCableNinja 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You dont need to go open source to allow self hosting, and, youll likely lose money that way. Its entirely possible to allow self hosting without being open source. Plenty of other projects do it.That being said, self hosting doesnt solve all issues.You, and whoever uses this product, will need MANY IPs because of blacklisting and throttling limits applied almost worldwide to all mail servers. Theres a reason why the marketing spam hosts have their own /24 or /25 and have 80% of them cycling through usage as a mail sender.Im not knocking your want to have something better than MailChimp and the like, but i feel like you didnt really dig into the real underlying tech and security before you went to work on this.replytln 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You realize that the sending is done by Amazon SES right?replyCableNinja 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I did not.At that point id just configure SES outright and not even use this solution.

Simple solve.replyblopker 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I was super excited when this popped up because I'm looking into solutions for this problem right now. I was, however, surprised to see it wasn't self-hosted or open source.As others have mentioned, there are security issues here that would be a non-starter for me. Even just having to open a database to the open internet for an external service to connect to is too much, even if I trusted that service completely.Self-hosted fixes these issues since outbound traffic can be locked down so only connections to SES are allowed, and no databases have to be exposed to the internet.However, many people will also not want more than 1 service talking directly to a database for a few reasons:1. Databases are often a single point of failure. A bad query can take down a whole service. Allowing queries that don't pass code review can be dangerous here, even if it's locked down to be read-only. This can be mitigated by talking to replica databases, but that's more setup.2. Migrations on data that is accessed directly from multiple services becomes harder. Many server frameworks handle data migrations, and they assume ownership of the data. These frameworks cannot account for other services and cannot make sure the queries will continue to work. This is less of an issue if the query is a one-off though.3. Having multiple services talk directly to a database pushes all the security, data validation and processing to the database. Many developers (myself included) prefer to keep database configuration as simple as possible since they are already complex.Anyway, sorry for the long post, but I thought my experience might be useful in developing this! Generally, I'd love to see a simple, self-hosted MailChimp. Especially one where I could keep all the configuration in version control.replyivanvanderbyl 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Agreed. This makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I'd rather a simple SDK that pushes the contact details to their API.replywohlgejm 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Another issue is that the data needed by this application is going to be sensitive - email addresses, names, etc. Many applications will encrypt these values with application logic. So a database function will need to perform it. The encryption key is going to be need to written into the query in this app if that works, adding more surface area to where that key lives. That's also assuming the simple use case of a single key, not per tenant, or roating, etc.replyshusson 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah what\u2019s the hesitation for having an API?replysosborn 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think even more interesting is that they chose to forgo the rather robust and easy to use API offered by Mailchimp in the first place.replyiamacyborg 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Mailchimp have already exposed customer user data.

To be honest, I'm hesitant to add open tracking because it always felt a bit creepy to me and also plenty of email clients are blocking them nowadays, so they're becoming useless.As for the data question, when you create a campaign, the following gets stored for each email that will get sent:- email address - JSON blob of the required variables that exist in the subject and body of the email (ex: {first_name: \"John\"}That's pretty much all the data that will be stored in our database which is sourced from your database.

I\u2019ll definitely try it outreplyaddisonj 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Congrats on the launch!Lots of really good stuff going on here, a few bits of feedback, ideas, etc, and also responding to some of the comments in other threads.* The quick explanation of how this works is pretty strong, but I think the differentiator/value over other services maybe isn't called out as well. To me, this seems pretty clearly ideal for smaller teams all in on JAMstack/serverless with a lean stack that don't/won't have an easy place to create an automated process for synchronization, and are more likely to be using a planetscale/supabase/neon where this model is more attractive. I would suggest adding some of that info, not only to help target customers better recognize the value prop, but also help discovery via SEO.* While the landing page gives a good overview, as a dev, before I sign up, I want more details of how it works, more complete examples, etc. For SaaS apps targeting the general market, after landing/product pages,the most visited pages are generally use cases, success stories, industry specific info, etc. But from my experience and talking with many others, for dev audience, docs are the next thing people visit (if they aren't ready to sign up). You don't need every doc at once, but things like a quick start guide, concept overview, feature overview, etc can all be high value docs that you generally need anyways for your first customers* With docs, you can better address and explain the security side of things. I would do less on the landing page in regards to security and push that to more in depth detail in the docs. Talk about best practices of creating a read-only user. Create guides for most popular db vendors, etc* As has already been mentioned, you will get concerns about any access to the db and \"why not an API\". I think these commenters are right that this will be a deal breaker for many companies, but I don't agree that you want an API. Not only because I think that reduces some of the value prop but also because then you would need to store customer data. I obviously don't know what you are storing today, but I would think that this model could have a big advantage if you didn't need to store any PII data in cc.dev. The complexity of dealing with compliance and regulatory requirements is no small part of why something like MailChimp is expensive is that burden. I don't know if this is something you currently consider a value prop (or if you have engineered to support this)... But I certainly would :)* To address the reality of private dbs/giving access to a db, I would look at potentially implementing an agent. This agent would then run the queries (still provided by the user) and just-in-time deliver the results when needed. Getting the model of this right that works across different companies view of security will mean this is probably best to do with a handful of potential customers.* As far as deployment and monetization model... I would only open source it if you are giving up on commercialization or if you can open source a subset that can be useful enough to build a community. Once again, returning to JAMstack, maybe solve in open source (but integrate) some problem unique to those teams. As far as a paid self-hosting, given that this seems like a one man show, I would resist it. Trying to do SaaS and support of self-hosting is rough, even for well funded VC backed teams..Quite a bit here, but if you want follows up on anything, my email is in profile or will reply to comments.Congrats again and hope it goes somewhere :)replykashnote 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Amazing points, thanks so much! Totally agree with you on the docs. I'll definitely look into creating some sort of agent (or some other solution), but I agree that some docs explaining everything will ease the minds of those who are on the fence.Hm interesting point on the open sourcing and monetization. I've been thinking a lot about this and still not sure if it's wise to open source it. I definitely want to generate revenue from this. Perhaps going open source would be detrimental to that.replyaddisonj 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I should say... Open source can be a great way to get a community of users, with a subset that will opt not to self-host, but, I think there are a lot of things to consider:* Can you shepherd a community, that will have issues with self-hosting, prs, bugs, etc AND do all the stuff needed to run a company (once again, assuming one person show here)* By going open source, you now are also \"competing\" with other OSS projects, which may drive toward features that don't drive value on commercial side. You may also find that the core value prop just doesn't translate well to open source, for example, if the target is JAMstack teams and you can't run this on vercel, cloudflare, fly, etc* I think the most successful open projects like this tend to be something that is a segment only really solved by proprietary companies. For example, workflow automation like Zapier built a novel model and led to open source with hosted version projects like n8n to replicate that, with many people offering that as a service inside their company. I think \"open source MailChimp\" isn't a bad play, but I don't know if that is really what you are doing, so it is hard to say if open sourcing would led to sales or to useful software that no one wants to pay forreplysergiotapia 14 hours ago | prev [\u2013]If I have SES and MJML and the SQL query - why not just run this on my app server? Why pay you to hit the SES API with my markup?I don't quite get it.replytillcarlos 4 hours ago | parent [\u2013]Because you don't have to build a feature in your own software that- stores the templates- selectively runs campaigns and tracks open rates etc- create campaigns, see how many users are in there, have a safeguard before you hit \"send\"- actually a nice interface.Let's assume the \"open my database to the internet\" is not a dealbreaker, then this tool gets your development cost of 1-8 weeks (depends on how big the code base is) down to a 19 USD / m. Depending on where you hire / how much your time is, your opportunity cost of several thousand dollars for the feature are now much smaller.I think there's a niche but strong case for this.[edit: typo]replyGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",

If you enjoy the newsletter, please forward it to a few friends/colleagues or click here to share it on Twitter!SubscribeHistory of the Simple Sabotage Field ManualBefore the CIA, there was the OSS - the Office of Strategic Services.Formed in 1942 in order to shore up American intelligence capabilities at the request of Franklin D. Roosevelt, before the end of WWII the OSS eventually employed ~24,000 people and had operations across Europe and Asia. Amongst its responsibilities was frustrating the German war effort, and to that end, it wrote a short set of \u201cbest practices\u201d - the Simple Sabotage Field Manual.The purpose of the manual is fairly straightforward - it is to\u2026\u2026characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it.Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives, to innumnerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type\u2026.Simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one\u2019s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the \u201chuman element,\" is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and cooperation are normally found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that \u201cmargin for error.\"The manual, published in 1944, has now been declassified - but it was once used as a reference guide for OSS operatives globally to train individuals in German-occupied territories how to best become \u201ccitizen saboteurs.\u201d It says that \u201cpurposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature\u201d and thus the manual means to serve as inspiration and direction for saboteurs.In short, the best way that ordinary citizens, unhappy with the German occupation, could aid the Allied military was to drive inefficiency in their workplaces - to slow down every attempt at progress and make even the simplest tasks frustrating.Specific examples involved mechanics not repairing engines on time, misplacing tools so that they are hard to find, or misusing tools so as to break them more frequently. Bus drivers could \u201caccidentally\u201d go past the bus stops where German officers would most likely be found or want to get off. Train operators could issue the wrong tickets to travelers so they end up at the wrong destination, or they could issue two tickets for the same seat to cause delays. Janitors could ensure a disorderly workplace environment by keeping things dirty or placing rice in water cooling systems. Even those without jobs could get involved - by giving wrong directions when asked, changing signposts to point the wrong way, or pretending to not speak whatever language the other person is using.How to Sabotage Your Team Most EffectivelyThis all got me thinking about Charlie Munger, and how he has said it is often easier to solve problems backwards than it is to solve them forwards - try to uncover the things that would most effectively prevent you from achieving your goals and just don\u2019t do those things - avoid what is certain to bring about failure so that you give yourself the best shot at success.In order to achieve our goals or to make progress generally, many times we rely on working with others. Often, this collaboration happens in the workplace. And this is where the OSS focused their expertise - how might we best destroy the ability of our organizations to make efficient and meaningful progress?So, with Charlie Munger\u2019s guidance in mind, what can we learn from the OSS\u2019 Simple Sabotage Field Manual? What do the experts say is the best way to sabotage the organizations in which we work?Think about how many of these things are a standard where you work. Does it feel like CIA operatives have been sabotaging your current workplace for decades - or that you might unwittingly have started to help their efforts? If so, can you do anything about that?ShareSubscribe nowSimple Steps to Ensure Organization DisfunctionIt is probably easiest to ensure progress will not be made if you are the owner or leader of an entire organization.

Illustrate your \u201cpoints\u201d by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.

It would be best if you can\u2026Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant productsWhen training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions\u2026 Give lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when questioned.To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.Don\u2019t order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted, so that the slightest delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers of poor machines.Last, but not least, if you are more of an employee looking to frustrate the well-intentioned efforts of those around you, it is best that you\u2026Work slowly.Spread rumors.Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can. When you go to the lavatory, spend longer time there than is necessary.Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skilful worker.Be as irritable and quarrelsome as possible without getting yourself into trouble.And there we have it - some of the easiest ways to prevent a group of people from effectively working together. If you are like me, many of these things sound surprisingly familiar. A manual written in 1944 seems to suggest that the best way to break down organizations is to utilize behaviors that organizations today treat as \u201cbest practices.\u201dThe next time you see these things causing trouble, maybe it makes sense to call them out. Explain how things might be done differently to improve your chance at success by avoiding the things sure to cause failures.If you get any pushback, send around this manual - maybe knowing that the U.S. military\u2019s best suggestion for citizens to help it win a war was to destroy an enemy\u2019s organizational efficiency will cause some pause. The military suggested the same practices you have been using to attempt the opposite.This may at least prompt a discussion about how we might improve our processes today.Subscribe nowShareTake care and have a great week,\u2014 EJBut What For?

(/s?)The article feels like one of these chain mail jokes rather than a serious article, but anyway.\"Insist on doing everything through \u201cchannels.\u201d Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.\"That bullet point list more or less describes Scrum.replyljm 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I don\u2019t think it does unless you take a dim view of it and perpetuate the simplistic scrum-agile bad meme.An easy way to throw an effective team into disarray in tech is to waylay it with back channel requests and unplanned work. If you\u2019re too busy fighting fires and working personal errands for disruptive managers and executives then you\u2019re not delivering what your team is supposed to deliver.The \u2018proper channel\u2019 isn\u2019t a bureaucracy as described in the SSFM, it\u2019s simply an ordered list of priorities with a gatekeeper.Edit: as far as dogmatically adhering to this process goes, then any effective agile/scrum process will have a baked in allowance to handle the unexpected or adapt to change, rather than stubbornly stay the course.replybartread 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I agree with your second point but...> I don\u2019t think it does unless you take a dim view of it and perpetuate the simplistic scrum-agile bad meme.Look, the thing is, if you've worked in a load of different organisations, and lots of different teams, with other smart people and have never really seen Scrum done well, and have in some cases actively seen it inhibit the delivery of quality software, I think it's legitimate to start questioning the process. People - smart people - struggle to make it work effectively. Plus, 50% of software developers (UX, product management, QA, SRE, stakeholders, etc.) are worse than average: a process that top quartile people struggle to make work well, sometimes even under the most favourable of circumstances, is less valuable when broadly applied across the delivery professions as a whole, and over different industry sectors.On the flip side, with any process being introduced, I think it's fair to spend some time, maybe 6 months (but it will vary, depending on the process), implementing that process fairly strictly. It does need time to bed in, and there will be areas of friction simply due to creating new habits or resistance to change rather than due to problems with the process during that time. You need time for those issues to shake out so that you can see how much value the process itself really delivers and where it can be improved. At the 6 month point you can review the process, implement improvements, and move forward. You can keep doing the same review/evolve process on whatever cycle you choose, and that way your processes are more in step with changes in the wider organisation (hopefully growth).Your processes need to fit your organisation, your business model, your culture. So, by all means, you can start with a process like Scrum, but to be really successful with it you need to treat it as just that: a starting point. You need to evolve it to fit your business. We all like to mock cargo-culting and yet, somehow, Scrum and agile often seem to blag a free pass. I don't understand why, because they shouldn't get that free pass. Your processes need to work for your business, and they are always a means for delivering value and never an end in themselves.replyisityouyesitsme 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Scrum as a concept doesn't matter. Agile as a thing doesn't matter. Team structure doesn't matter.All that matters is who has authority and the business both enforcing that authority and also making sure that authority is being used to accomplish business efficiently and not causing greater risk in the process.

But it\u2019s not the most improbable victory. We\u2019re republishing this story from August 2018 about an economist who perfected the lottery:Just after 11 PM on February 15, 1992, a janky ball machine at the Virginia State Lottery HQ spit out 6 winning numbers on live television: 8\u2026 11\u2026 13\u2026 15\u2026 19\u2026 20.In the coming days, officials would find out that one \u201cperson\u201d had secured not only the $27,036,142 jackpot, but 6 second prizes, 132 third prizes, and 135k minor prizes collectively worth another $900k.What unfolded next was the strangest, most improbable lottery tale in history \u2014 one involving thousands of international investors, dozens of complex computer systems, and a mathematical savant who\u2019d masterminded the entire operation from the other side of the world.This is the story of the man who \u201cgamed\u201d the lottery by buying every possible combination.In the late 1960s, a young Romanian economist named Stefan Mandel was struggling to get by.At the time, Romania was under oppressive Communist rule, a period marred by poverty, job and food shortages, and \u201cprofound misery.\u201d Mandel\u2019s salary of 360 lei (US $10) a month was not enough to make ends meet, and, as he later told Planet Money, he needed a way to \u201cget some serious money, quickly.\u201dMany Romanians in Mandel\u2019s predicament had, out of necessity, turned to lives of crime. But Mandel, a self-described \u201cphilosopher-mathematician,\u201d saw another way out: The lottery.Top: Stefan Mandel spent more than a decade reading mathematical theories before winning his first lottery in the 1960s; Bottom: Mandel\u2019s lottery feats made headlines in his hometown Romanian newspaper (Via Busra; Illustrations: The Hustle)Let\u2019s take a step back here: What kind of idiot banks on winning the lottery? You\u2019re literally more likely to win an Olympic gold medal, have identical quintuplets, or get crushed by a vending machine.Well, Mandel wasn\u2019t just any guy \u2014 he was a natural with numbers who spent every spare minute analyzing theoretical probability papers written by the 13th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. And, after years of research, he wrote a \u201cnumber-picking algorithm\u201d based on a method he dubbed \u201ccombinatorial condensation.\u201dEnjoying this article?Get the Hustle\u2019s 5-minute weekday roundup that keeps you hip to happenings in tech, business, and internet\u2026 things.Delivered weekdays plus a bonus Sunday feature. Unsubscribe whenever.\u201cI\u2019m a weekend mathematician, an accountant without too much education,\u201d he later told a Romanian magazine. \u201cBut mathematics properly applied can guarantee a fortune.\u201dHere\u2019s how it worked.If a player picked 6 numbers in a 49-ball lottery, his odds of winning were 1 in 13,983,816. If he selected 15 numbers (which required purchasing 5,005 games \u2014 one for each possible combination), his odds of winning increased to 1 in 2,794. Mandel claimed that his algorithm could reduce these 5,005 combinations to just 569.If the 6 winning numbers fell among his 15 picks, he\u2019d be guaranteed to win at least a 2nd prize and hundreds of smaller prizes \u2014 and he\u2019d have a 1 in 10 chance of winning the grand prize.Mandel banded together with 4 friends, each of whom bought 228 tickets per draw.Miraculously (and with a lot of luck), he won the first prize of 72,783 lei (about US $2k, or $16.8k adjusted for inflation). After expenses, he walked away with enough to bribe foreign ministry officials and flee Romania for a new life \u2014 and a bigger jackpot.Turning lottery wins into a businessAfter 4 years of roaming around Europe, Mandel settled in Australia and he set out to game the lottery in a different way.In the typical lottery, a set of numbers within a certain range (say, 1-50) are randomly selected; if yours match in any order, you win the jackpot. The chances of winning are based on the number of possible combinations of these numbers, often in the millions.But Mandel caught on to something: In certain lottos, the jackpot would climb to an amount more than 3x the cost of buying every combination.For example, let\u2019s say a lottery required 6 picks of numbers between 1 and 40. This would yield 3,838,380 possible number combinations (calculator here). Now, let\u2019s say that same lottery had a $10m jackpot. In theory, Mandel could buy a ticket for every single combination at $1 each and be guaranteed a win \u2014 and, after taxes, a decent profit.Mandel maintained that \u201cany high school math student could calculate the combinations.\u201d But this method came with some major logistical setbacks. How would he get the capital? And how could he possibly fill out hundreds of thousands of tickets, number by number?Mandel\u2019s system was simple \u2014 but incredibly complex from a logistical standpoint (The Hustle)Over a period of years, Mandel convinced hundreds of investors to pool their money together and create a \u201clotto syndicate.\u201d He then developed a full-fledged automation system: A room full of printers and computers running on an algorithm that pre-populated tickets with every combination.Computers revolutionized Mandel\u2019s process. Before, he\u2019d been limited to writing out millions of combinations by hand, where a single mistake could ruin 8 months\u2019 worth of work; now, he could outsource the work to a machine.Throughout the 1980s, Mandel\u2019s syndicate would wait until a jackpot was 3x bigger than the cost of covering all possible combinations, then \u201cmove to buy\u201d thousands of tickets. They managed to win 12 lotteries (and rake in 400k smaller prizes) across Australia, including a $1.1m haul in 1986.\u201cEveryone said to me: You can not, you will not succeed! \u201d Mandel told a Romanian newspaper at the time. \u201cNow, the voices that have long [cast me as] a dreamer have been silenced.\u201dBut Mandel\u2019s system soon attracted negative attention.His repeated wins prompted Australian lottery authorities to change the law, disallowing a single person from covering every possible combination.So, he set his sights on much bigger feat \u2014 one that would make international headlines and boggle the minds of lottery officials around the world.Virginia or bustMandel began by identifying lotteries where the jackpot had risen to at least 3x the cost of buying all possible combinations.Ultimately, he printed out tickets for 6 US lotteries, including Massachusetts ($37m jackpot to 9m combinations), Arizona ($11m to 5.1m), and Virginia.Virginia\u2019s lottery offered several advantages. It was fairly new, and allowed buyers to purchase tickets in unlimited quantities and print them at home. But most importantly, its numbers only ranged from 1 to 44 (other states went as high as 54). This meant that with 6 picks, there were \u201conly\u201d 7,059,052 possible combinations, compared to the usual 25m+.Top: A 1992 headline from the New York Times; Bottom: a 1992 Virginia lottery ticket (via NYT Archives)Mandel set up an agency with a major insurance company. Under the shell corporation Pacific Financial Resources, he established a trust called the International Lotto Fund (ILF) and convinced 2,560 people to buy a 10-year whole life insurance policy, with a $4k annual premium. Mandel then used this money, legally, to buy each person a stake in the lottery.In a Melbourne warehouse, he set up 30 computers and 12 laser printers, and hired 16 full-time employees to print millions of tickets pre-populated with every combination \u2014 a process that took 3 months. He then shipped the one-tonne of paper weight to a point-person in the US at a cost of $60k.With the tickets secured in Virginia, Mandel had to wait until the jackpot hit a number that would make financial sense after taxes, overhead, and paying off investors.A state lottery prize typically begins in the low millions and increases every time a drawing goes by with no winner. (When you see those insane $758m jackpots, it means nobody has won in quite some time.) Mandel had to anticipate when to strike, and had to hope for the best that there wouldn\u2019t be multiple winners to dilute the pot and ruin his margins.On February 12, 1992, the Virginia Lottery jackpot hit $15.5m. Mandel\u2019s team on the ground was given a simple directive: Go.And nobody \u2014 not even Mandel \u2014 could\u2019ve anticipated the madness that would ensue.As Mandel knew, the \u201cbuy all combinations\u201d method of winning the lottery was more of a logistical than a financial challenge. The hard part was yet to come.Tickets could be legally printed at home, but they still had to be taken to an authorized lotto retailer in the US, paid for (at $1 each), and processed. Waltzing into a gas station with 1.4m tickets and a truckload of cash wasn\u2019t an option.Mandel hired the accounting firm Lowe Lippmann to transfer $9m in investor funds to Crestar Bank in Boston, where it was cut into $10k cashier\u2019s checks. He then lined up advance deals with Virginia-based retail chains to buy the tickets in bulk. All he needed was a point-person on the ground to orchestrate the mayhem.For this task, Mandel turned to an esteemed associate by the name of Anithalee Alex.Anithalee Alex, an ex-paratrooper and failed oil man, was Mandel\u2019s unlikely man on the ground in Virginia (Illustration by The Hustle; image via \u2018How\u2019d They Do That?\u2019, 1992)Perennially outfitted in a gold rolex and a safari suit, Alex was a sweet talker who could \u201cmake the world seem like a bed of roses.\u201d An ex-paratrooper turned Rolls Royce salesman turned oil prospector, he could often be seen gallivanting around his small town of Teutopolis, Illinois, in a t-shirt that read: \u201cPlease Lord, let me prove to you that winning the lottery won\u2019t spoil me.\u201dWhen his old pal, Mandel, rang, Alex was fresh out of bankruptcy court, with $400k in debt and 16 maxed-out credit cards. He was ready for action \u2014 any action.The job was harrowing: He was to coordinate the drop-off, payment, and processing of 1.4m lottery tickets at hundreds of stores all over Virginia.The jackpot hit $15.5m on a Wednesday; the next draw would be on Saturday. This meant that he and his team had just 72 hours to pull it off.A logistical nightmareOn February 12, 1992 \u2014 3 days before the draw \u2014 Alex checked into a Holiday Inn in Norfolk, Virginia and set up a \u201ccommand center\u201d at the Koger Center, a nearby business park.In the 88-acre \u201cmaze of buildings,\u201d Alex met with a team of 35 couriers hired by Mandel (most of whom were certified accountants) and distributed cellophane-wrapped bundles of 10k tickets with stacks of $10k cashier\u2019s checks.\u201cThink of it like an office pool,\u201d he reportedly told the CPAs, \u201cexcept a larger office pool.\u201dFor 2 straight days, the couriers methodically descended on 125 gas stations and supermarkets. At Farm Fresh, Miller Mart, and Tinee Giant locations throughout the region, flummoxed store clerks were asked to buy and process 1.4m algorithmically-generated lotto tickets.Mandel sat back in the shadows in Australia while his team orchestrated his Virginia plan (Via The Sydney Morning Herald, 1992)\u201cWe thought they were nuts,\u201d Rick Miller, a local gas station proprietor, later admitted. \u201cBut if someone comes up and says they want to buy 700k lottery tickets, we\u2019re not going to chase them away.\u201dA representative at Farm Fresh, who sold a portion of tickets to Mandel\u2019s team, had a more spirited take: \u201cFor someone to try to do this ticket-by-ticket is a very chancy proposition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what lotto\u2019s all about.\u201dBy Saturday evening, the team was nearing completion. Then, disaster struck.One of the chains who\u2019d sold tickets in bulk got overwhelmed and quit in the final hours, leaving 140k tickets (700k combinations) on the table. When the deadline for entry arrived, around 1.24m of Mandel\u2019s 1.4m tickets (6.4m of 7m combinations) had been processed. Mandel\u2019s \u201cfool proof\u201d plan, which relied on securing every single possibility, was in jeopardy.Like a regular lottery, winning the jackpot would ultimately come down to luck.\u201cThe most incredible thing in the world\u201dMandel knew that without 100% of the combinations secured, his strategy was reduced to a multi-million dollar game of chance.He was aware of other ill-fated attempts to game a US lottery by bulk-buying tickets: In 1990, a Sacramento retiree bought 30k tickets with a diaper bag full of cash and walked away empty-handed; months later, a computer engineer known as \u201cThe Phantom\u201d purchased 80k combinations at a Jacksonville, Florida bar and only won minor prizes.Even if Mandel were to win, there was the possibility of multiple winners \u2014 a scenario that could significantly dilute the jackpot.At 11:20 PM on February 15th, the numbers were drawn on live television. In a nearby warehouse, Alex and his team waited with baited breath.Then, a victorious shout: They\u2019d won.Mandel\u2019s victory made international headlines (via assorted US and Australian newspapers, 1992)\u201cWhen the $27m ticket came up, everybody was 6 feet off the ground,\u201d Alex later said. \u201cIt was the most incredible thing in the world.\u201d Purchased at a Farm Fresh in Chesapeake, the ticket had been processed in the twilight hours. Alex\u2019s diligence had paid off.From his home in Australia, Mandel sent out a short message to his 2,524 investors: \u201cOne of our target lotteries did jackpot to our required level,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe entered and won.\u201dThe $27,036,142 jackpot (and $900k in secondary prizes) was to be paid out in 20 annual installments of $1.03m. But Virginia\u2019s lottery czars had other plans.What would Thomas Jefferson say?Although completely legal under both US and Virginia state law, the Australian group\u2019s feat was interpreted as an effort to \u201ccheat\u201d the traditional system.\u201cWe might remember Thomas Jefferson\u2019s view of a lottery,\u201d Virginia Lottery director Ken Thorson pled to the press. \u201cIt is an opportunity for the common man to spend a small sum for the possibility of a higher prize\u2026 We never anticipated a group trying to make such a large purchase.\u201dMandel was subjected to an investigation involving 14 international agencies, including the CIA, FBI, IRS, National Crime Authority, and Australian Securities Commission.Ken Thorson, director of the Virginia Lottery, emerged as Mandel\u2019s arch nemesis after the big win (Illustration by The Hustle; image via \u2018How\u2019d They Do That?\u2019, 1992)In the end, neither Mandel nor the ILF was found guilty of any wrongdoing. \u201cI will live to be 150,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cI am not the type of person who lays down and dies because some glorified clerk doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\u201dMeanwhile, in his home country of Australia, he became something of a folk hero: An article in People magazine described him as a kangaroo hopping out of the US with a pouch full of cash \u2014 defiant, victorious, and full of life.And what became of the mastermind?When the dust settled, each person who\u2019d bought into the lottery through Mandel\u2019s life insurance policy \u2014 small business owners, machine operators, housekeepers, and doctors \u2014 made out with around $1.4k.Some were not pleased with this outcome. \u201cStefan Mandel is not only irrelevant,\u201d a disgruntled investor later quipped. \u201cHe\u2019s toxic.\u201dMeanwhile, Mandel paid himself a one-time \u201cconsultant\u2019s fee\u201d of $1.7m, and purportedly sold the annuity on the 20-year payout to a US insurance company for a lump sum of $14m. After overhead fees ($5.5m for the tickets, and $500k in expenses), he was left with a princely sum.Records show that he funneled this cash into the Pacific Basin Fund, a Hong Kong-based account managed by his brother-in-law. \u201cWhat we calculated to be the reality has changed,\u201d he wrote in a 1994 letter to investors. \u201cIt may not seem such a hot investment now.\u201dAfter that, his investor updates went cold.An advertisement Stefan Mandel ran in Australian newspapers to find investors for his lottery schemes (The Age, 1986-7)Just a few years later, in 1995, Mandel declared bankruptcy. He then spent the next decade running various investment schemes \u2014 one of which earned him a 10-month jail sentence in Israel for the \u201calleged non-publication of a prospectus in a cooperative society.\u201d (Mandel\u2019s attorney said his conviction was later overturned, and that Mandel never spent a single day in prison.)Today, Mandel spends his days at a beach house on a remote tropical island in Vanuatu, a country off the coast of Australia. He lives a quiet life and reports being \u201cretired\u201d from the lottery.Anithalee Alex, his one-time associate, also dropped off the grid, and keeps a low-profile life somewhere in Illinois. \u201cYou could not have written a script as good as this,\u201d he reminisced, years later. \u201cThis is one time real life was better than fiction.\u201dThough we were able to piece together the logistics of Mandel\u2019s 20-year lottery career, he\u2019s never revealed the minute details of his algorithm. As he told an enquiring AP reporter in 1992, \u201cThat would be like Coca-Cola revealing their recipe.\u201dHis legacy lives on in US legislation: All 44 states that run lotteries have enacted laws preventing the profitable replication of Mandel\u2019s strategy. In effect, this secures him a title as the first and last man to ever successfully game the lottery by buying every possible combination.Prefer audio?

With publicity about an outsized jackpot, the general public is also expected to buy tickets in larger numbers, making it hard to estimate the expected winnings.For that reason, I would not consider this to be gaming, or cheating the lottery. There was no guaranteed profit, and a moderate chance of large losses. So he took a big gamble, and was lucky to be the only winner in the end.An interesting question is whether lotteries should publish the number of tickets sold when it implies expected winnings for every single ticket sold (as was the case in Mandel's lottery).

Certainly there are some numbers that people over bet, and in some lotteries you could avoid some of them in principle by betting on numbers that couldn\u2019t possibly be part of a date.The upside for the scheme is limited though because a large majority of lottery tickets are sold as \u2018quick picks\u2019 where the machine picks a random number for you which is not only easy but a sound min max strategy.replyClumsyPilot 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> cheating the lotteryIsn't this a contradiction?

The result of Leonard v Pepsico makes lots of sense read in the context of something like Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company (the classic English contract law case every student learns).In Carlill the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. claimed it had never intended a contract to arise, that the advertisements were just \"puffery\" and no reasonable person should have expected (as Carlill did) that if they do what it says in the advert and yet they get Influenza anyway (Carbolic Smoke Balls were a bogus cure for flu) they can claim the \u00a3100 stated (then a considerable sum of money) like it says in the advert. The judge said well, why does the advert explain that the company has \u00a31000 in a bank account? If there's no intention to pay people money, why did you make a bank account, put money in it and tell them about it? No, this is clearly a contract, you offered, she accepted by performance, now you need to pay the nice lady.But Pepsico clearly doesn't expect to give out fighter jets. It doesn't have any fighter jets, and the depicted scenario is ludicrous, which is exactly the opposite situation.We can see that - at least after the initial hype - John Leonard saw this as a profile opportunity more than a serious attempt to get Pepsico to give him a jet, when he's like oh, this shouldn't be a Federal trial, this should be in front of a jury of my peers, and I define \"My peers\" to be \"The Pepsi generation\" that's clearly not serious any more.replydenton-scratch 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]According to the article, the scheme depends on this seekrit algorithm for picking all the combinations, called \"combinatorial condensation\".That term links to an article in Romanian, which I can't read.

On week 5, $2MM in tickets could buy $5MM in winnings, but that doesn't mean the scheme is negative.

Ana Pauker, the Romanian foreign minister (herself jewish) brokered a deal with Israel to allow 4000 jews/month to emigrate to Israel. Several other rounds of exit visas given by the Romanian government to jewish people emigrating to Israel (with oil equipement and hard cash received in return) led to basically an exodus of most jews in Romania. As an anecdote, my hometown was 80% jewish when my parents were born and two years ago, the last jewish person passed away at a littler over 100 years of age. I also have jewish ancenstry.. To post some numbers, there were ~400k jews in Romania at the end of WW2 and less than ~10k when the Iron Curtain fell. A large part of (what I consider to be) Romanian culture was lost during the cummunist quest of rewriting history and creating a 'pure' nation.Just to put things into perspective. The communist rule in Romania was brutal and criminal even after the Red Army retreated and was under 100% Romanian leadership, and was especially brutal against ethnic minorities. Jewish people actually targeted during the anti-semitic Stalin purge which echoed in Romania as well, as local aparatchicks used this to purge the jews out of government (Anna Pauker is also a victim of that - not to defend her, she was also commie trash but a victim of antisemitism nontheless).I don't blame the guy for wanting out.replyemmender1 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]for all of his mathematical , logistical prowess, he should have focused his attention on the bigger casino: the stock market.

Been using it as my default browser for 6 months and not looking back.On first launch it looks and behaves a bit like Safari, but to give you an idea, here are the various ways I customized it on my phone.- More screen real estate for the webpage, less for the toolbar.- A compact toolbar containing only the buttons for actions I use the most: new tab, close tab, open tab list. Since I use them hundred times a day, I need them available with button taps instead of swipe gestures.- A toolbar button layout adapted to my left-handedness.- A toolbar that disappears on scroll to allow full-screen reading.- The toolbar and address bar at the bottom, as they should be.- A popup menu showing the full URL and the buttons I use less frequently: back/forward (already available as screen edge gestures), share, reload, settings, etc.- Showing the page title in the toolbar.- Read time estimation for each tab.- Opening the keyboard automatically when I open a new tab.- Sorting tabs by read time, so that I can decide what to read based on how much time and focus I have.- Grouping tabs by domain.- A flat, condensed tab list, without snapshots.- A full-black toolbar in dark mode to read at night.It\u2019s still early days but things like content blockers, reader mode, iPad support, and more should arrive soon enough.And of course, no analytics/monitoring/telemetry, no account creation, no backend. It\u2019s not open source, but you can also inspect the app\u2019s web views with Safari developer tools to see what\u2019s going on under the hood.Would love to hear if the level of personalization my app provides resonates with like-minded people.Have a great day!orr721 14 hours ago | next [\u2013]Hi I like it very much, it reminds me of Firefox Focus (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/...).

I simply got burned out on trying to use reader apps, given there are so many of them out there, all just not feeling quite right to me at the end of the day (similar to how there are bajillion different todo apps of all kinds and sizes).So it isn't like i had some specific set of requirements that i was looking for in a reader app and was actively searching for it. It was more of a case of \"i don't know what i actually want until i see it, and i gave up on actively searching for it\". Tastefully opinionated defaults and workflows draw me in, can't argue with that.Realistically, no matter how wide your reach could've been, I probably wouldn't have noticed the app unless I saw an HN thread about it like this one.

In WebKit, that\u2019s part of the engine while with Blink it\u2019s part of the browser. So while using WebKit gets you multiprocess regardless of how your app is built, if you\u2019re using Blink you need to bring Chromium along for the ride or roll your own to get that.And of course Gecko is joined at the hip with XUL, so to do anything with it your only real choice is fork Firefox.Really hoping Ladybird turns out well and/or Servo takes off because there\u2019s a dearth of properly embeddable web engines right now.replyhahn-kev 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Except it still sucks to develop websites for it and they often get a worse experience because of that.replyEtheryte 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm not sure if this observation is as novel as you make it sound: every product that's successful is so because of what it does, not because of the technology it's built on.
