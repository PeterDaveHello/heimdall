The IRS will conduct a limited-scope pilot during the 2024 tax season to further assess customer support and technology needs. It will also provide a platform for the IRS to evaluate successful solutions for potential operational challenges identified in the report the IRS submitted to CongressPDF earlier this year. Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York have decided to work with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot for filing season 2024. Taxpayers in nine other states without an income tax – Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming -- may also be eligible to participate in the pilot. Washington has also chosen to join the integration effort for the state's application of the Working Families Tax Credit. All states were invited to join the pilot, but not all states were in a position to join the pilot at this time. \"This is a critical step forward for this innovative effort that will test the feasibility of providing taxpayers a new option to file their returns for free directly with the IRS,\" said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. \"In this limited pilot for 2024, we'll be working closely with the states that have agreed to participate in an important test run of the state integration. This will help us gather important information about the future direction of the Direct File program.\" People in those 13 states may be eligible to participate in the 2024 Direct File pilot, a new service that will provide taxpayers with the choice to electronically file their federal tax return directly with the IRS for free. Taxpayer eligibility to participate in the pilot will be limited by the state in which the taxpayer resides and will be limited to taxpayers with certain types of income, credits and deductions – taxpayers with relatively simple returns. The IRS today announced it anticipates specific income types, such as wages on a Form W-2, and important tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, will be covered by the Direct File pilot. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided the IRS with long-term funding for the agency to transform its operations and improve taxpayer service, enforcement and technology. It also directed the IRS to study the possibility of a free, direct e-file program, which the IRS submitted in a report to Congress in May 2023. Projects like Direct File represent a goal of the IRS Strategic Operating Plan, to give taxpayers choices in how they interact with the tax agency. This includes choices in how they prepare and file their taxes, whether it's through a tax professional, commercial tax software or free filing options. Direct File is one more potential option from which qualifying taxpayers will be able to choose to file a 2023 federal tax return during the 2024 filing season. Since the delivery of the Direct File report in May – as directed by the Treasury Department – the IRS has been working to develop a pilot for the upcoming filing season, paying special attention to issues identified in the report related to customer support and state taxes. This limited-scale pilot will allow the IRS to evaluate the costs, benefits and operational challenges associated with providing a voluntary Direct File option to taxpayers. \"We have more work in front of us on this project,\" Werfel said. \"The Direct File pilot is undergoing continuous testing with taxpayers to identify and resolve issues to ensure its user friendly and easy to understand. We continue to finalize the pilot details and anticipate more changes before we launch for the 2024 tax season. Direct File, if pursued further after the pilot, would be another option eligible taxpayers have to help them prepare their tax returns in addition to existing options such as the use of a tax professional, tax software, Free File or another option. It's consistent with the IRS mission to make sure taxpayers have available options that work the best for their personal situation.\" Direct File pilot basics Eligible taxpayers may choose to participate in the pilot next year to file their tax year 2023 federal tax return for free, directly with the IRS. Direct File will be a mobile-friendly, interview-based service that will work as well on a mobile phone as it does on a laptop, tablet or desktop computer. The service will be available in English and Spanish for the pilot. The Direct File pilot will be a limited, phased pilot. It will not be available to all eligible taxpayers when the IRS begins accepting tax returns. Because the IRS wants to make sure the program works effectively, Direct File will first be introduced to a small group of eligible taxpayers in filing season 2024. As the filing season progresses, more and more eligible taxpayers will be able to access the service to file their 2023 tax returns. Direct File does not replace existing filing options like tax professionals, Free File, free return preparation sites, commercial software and authorized e-file providers. Taxpayers will continue to have choices, whether they want to use a tax professional, a software product, Free File, free tax preparation services like Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) as well as a paper tax return or Direct File. Taxpayers participating in the pilot will have access to help by IRS employees staffing the Direct File customer support function. IRS customer service representatives will provide technical support and provide basic clarification of tax law related to the tax scope of Direct File. Questions related to issues other than Direct File will be routed to other IRS customer support, as appropriate. Pilot eligibility is limited Eligibility for the pilot is limited by the types of income, tax credits and deductions that the product can initially support. Taxpayers who fall outside the pilot's eligibility limits will be unable to participate in the pilot in 2024. Direct File will cover only individual federal tax returns during the pilot. Also, Direct File will not prepare state returns. However, once a federal return is completed and filed, Direct File will guide taxpayers who want to file a state return to a state-supported tool that taxpayers can use to prepare and file a stand-alone state tax return. For the pilot in 2024, where taxpayers may have state or local tax obligations, the IRS will limit eligibility to states that are actively partnering with the IRS on the pilot. Eligibility to participate in the pilot will be limited to taxpayers who reside in certain states where the pilot is available. Taxpayers in Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming may be eligible to participate in the pilot as their states do not levy a state income tax. Washington has also chosen to join the integration effort as a partner for the state's application of the Working Families Tax Credit. For states that do levy a state income tax, Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York have chosen to partner with the IRS for the 2024 Direct File pilot. The IRS anticipates the pilot will be available in those states as well in 2024. The IRS and the Departments of Revenue in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New York and Washington entered into separate Memorandums of Understanding in September for the purposes of collaboration on the IRS's Direct File pilot for filing season 2024. This approach will test the IRS's ability to successfully integrate with a handful of states and the IRS will continue to work with all states to secure feedback and share what it learns through the course of its work on the pilot. 2024 Direct File pilot eligibility expected to cover key income, tax credits Eligibility to participate in the 2024 pilot will be limited to reporting only certain types of income and claiming limited credits and adjustments. The tax scope for the pilot is still being finalized and is subject to change, but the IRS currently anticipates it will include: Income reporting W-2 wage income Social Security and railroad retirement income Unemployment compensation Interest of $1,500 or less Credits Earned Income Tax Credit Child Tax Credit Credit for Other Dependents Deductions Standard deduction Student loan interest Educator expenses Evaluating the Direct File Pilot The purpose of the Direct File pilot is to test the system the IRS has developed and to learn from that test. This includes testing the technology, customer support, state integration, fraud detection and the overall taxpayer experience. The best way to test a new service offering such as Direct File is in a limited, controlled environment that will allow the IRS to identify issues and make changes prior to any potential large-scale launch in the future. The 2024 filing season serves as a pilot for Direct File, and the purpose is to learn about the Direct File service itself and the needs of taxpayers who use it. By starting with a pilot, the IRS can efficiently learn about Direct File's effectiveness, identify areas of improvement for future iterations and ensure it meets the needs of taxpayers who want to use it. The IRS will publicly share the results of the pilot when available. More information will be available at IRS.gov/directfile.

I find it slightly easier than TurboTax, in fact.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freetaxusa.com&#x2F; reply tombert 13 hours agorootparentJackson Hewitt Online isn&#x27;t terribly pricey (Cost me a total of about $25 last year), so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve used for the last two years. Keep in mind that Jackson Hewitt Online is a different thing that the vanilla Jackson HewittStill, I kind of feel annoyed that I have to pay any amount of money to do something legally required of me to avoid going to jail. I think the IRS should provide a free option for filing, and TurboTax&#x2F;FreeTaxUSA&#x2F;Jackson Hewitt would be forced to provide a better service than \"the bare minimum\". reply PaulDavisThe1st 12 hours agorootparentFreeFillableForms (.com) is 100% free, has no income limits, has every IRS schedule & form.It&#x27;s basically backed by the IRS and implemented by Intuit et al, but appears independent.It works a little better every year, but you do still have to manually carry over some numbers from form to form.I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 8 years at least. I don&#x27;t love it to death, but if it wasn&#x27;t available I&#x27;d do my own paper forms anyway. reply resoluteteeth 12 hours agorootparentFreeFillableForms is basically like doing the paper forms by hand and it&#x27;s much easier to make a mistake than using something like turbotax. I&#x27;ve used both that and the excel files at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;incometaxspreadsheet&#x2F;home in the past but I realized that the hassle if I screwed something up was much worse than paying for tax prep software.I&#x27;m very glad that the IRS is going to be making something that&#x27;s more comparable to turbotax now. reply extraduder_ire 8 hours agorootparentprevI think the URL is freefilefillableforms.com (note the \"file\", the \"FreeFillableForms\" domain is parked by someone) based on some light googling and a contact email I saw on the irs.gov site.Glad a digital equivalent to paper forms exists, the US tax code is far less hellish than I previously believed. reply loeg 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can fill out the forms manually for free? It just sucks. reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentI quit doing paper forms ~10 years ago when I missed coping line 12c from form 5678-e to line 34-f of form 9876-k. The hassle of correcting that was enough to make me quit doing taxes by hand.It takes longer to do my taxes via the web forms than it did by hand (which says just how bad the UI of tax prep is!), but it saves me from human mistakes.Note that the ISR already has all the information they need to do my taxes for me. They just don&#x27;t do them. reply tomcam 11 hours agorootparent> it saves me from human mistakesNot me! FreeFillableForms is apparently the last piece of software in the western world that doesn’t save your progress as you go. I found that out the hard way about three days ago and immediately switched to freetaxusa. reply bluGill 10 hours agorootparentI use freetaxusa as well (well their paid version from same company). It is slower than paper, but it saves progress. reply tomcam 8 hours agorootparentAlthough it’s slower than paper, it gives you an up-to-date dynamic final results so that’s pretty cool reply II2II 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not that it sucks, it is error prone. Completely ignore a knowledge of tax law for a moment. Data has to be copied from one form to another, copied for calculation (whether you do it on paper or with a calculator), copied from one line to another, and finally copied from the form into the government&#x27;s tax software. Each step produces the potential for error. Properly written software does not have the same potential for error. reply loeg 10 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you&#x27;re agreeing with me that it sucks. reply drdec 9 hours agorootparentprev> Properly written software does not have the same potential for error.To err is human, to really foul things up requires a computer.As a user, how do you know that the tax software you are using was \"properly written\"? reply aeries 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not following the point of this comment? TurboTax&#x27;s correctness is battle-tested by millions of people every year- the odds of you making a mistake carrying over numbers by hand are way higher than TT making a calculation error. reply callalex 12 hours agorootparentprevI can also walk down to the nearby river to launder my clothes and carry back water to prepare food for my family. Instead we use technology to save time and improve our lives. That we continue to allow corrupt businesses to hold us back so a few people can extort&#x2F;profit is a testament to our failed state. reply tomcam 11 hours agorootparentAt least you live in an awesome neighborhood reply tombert 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve thought about doing that before just to say that I&#x27;ve done it, but it always seemed a bit intimidating. I also have completely illegible handwriting now, so filling anything in by hand is effectively a non-starter. reply loeg 12 hours agorootparentYou can fill in a PDF form rather than writing it by hand. reply risho 13 hours agorootparentprevsorry... cheaper? surely a place called free tax usa would be free? reply rez9x 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve used FreeTaxUSA since 2014 and I&#x27;ve never had to pay for federal, but I have had to pay something for state file.

The only thing that you are paying for are state taxes. reply tomcam 11 hours agorootparentprevJust used FreeTaxUSA this week for the first time. Crazy good UI. Highly recommended. reply notyourwork 8 hours agorootparentprevFirst time user last year. Pleased with the UX, would repeat unless IRS gives new an option. reply mtgentry 10 hours agorootparentprevI second this, FreeTaxUSA is great. reply pipodeclown 3 hours agoparentprevI find it bizarre that this is even a market in the US. I would think enabling people to do their taxes is a basic task of the government. Where I&#x27;m from the government provides a very simple click through filing system. Most information is auto filled from info the government already has or is manditorily shared with it such as my income as reported by my employer and any tax withholdings performed by them, securities holdings at brokers, houses registered on my name etc. I basically just have to click &#x27;yep, that all sounds right&#x27;, and I&#x27;m done. The tax authorities slogan over here is \"we can&#x27;t make doing your taxes fun, we can make it easy\". reply over_bridge 2 hours agorootparentYeah it&#x27;s wild that you have to calculate your own bill to the government. Just tell me the amount and I&#x27;ll pay it. reply nashashmi 12 hours agoparentprevJust print out the sheet from your broker of all the trades you did with the end result of gains circled.

The latter category, though, isn&#x27;t the complete picture, because tips and commissions would tend to push compensation up over minimum wage as a rule.Of the 141k, 53k are teenagers, so that leaves 88k full adults (age 20+) making minimum wage.

You can respond explaining why they are wrong, or pay. The interest is so low that, as long as you don&#x27;t goof up every year, you&#x27;re better off risking underpayment than overpayment.Honestly, the system would work better if the tax prep software could see all the information the IRS has, because then it would be easier to correct their mistakes and harder to make mistakes. reply bb123 3 hours agorootparent>Because the IRS isn&#x27;t allowed to tell you what you owe.>Eventually, the IRS calculates what they think you owe, and if you underpaid, they send you a billIt definitely feels like a few steps could be skipped here… reply reustle 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s to say it doesn&#x27;t start incorporating some of that data in the future?

No need for them to consider other possibilities. Once, a client provided poor numbers on their 1099 and I used my version. Both versions based on my invoices.

Tax education in our country is next to 0 but our taxes are extremely complicated. Many Americans have non-USA ties (even some Americans who lived in the USA their entire lives can have family members outside the country, but definitely Nth generation immigrants and recent immigrants) and what you said is not true if non-USA finances (bank accounts, inheritance, income etc) are involved. It is possible to make a tiny honest mistake and have to face huge $$$ penalty consequences. Such as FBAR, Form 8938, Form 3520 to name a few, these are things almost no American knows but if your grandpa from Mexico dies and you don&#x27;t report his property in Form 3520 you may be billed up to $100k penalty. Sure, if this was an honest mistake they&#x27;ll waive this penalty but not always and certainly not without a tax lawyer fighting for you. Now you need to hire a CPA and a tax lawyer and this is not cheap.I personally find it misleading to undersell how high stakes taxes are in the US. Sure for 95% of the people if you make a tiny honest mistake nothing will happen, but it&#x27;s not like a small error in your taxes can&#x27;t cause a huge ordeal.

And then you can file electronically for free regardless of your income level, and it produces a final PDF with all forms filled out for your files.It can be tricky to do your taxes the first time around depending on their complexity, but the good thing is that once you figure it out, you just use the previous year&#x27;s PDF&#x27;s as a reference for the current year&#x27;s.

Transactions get assigned to accounts, then (at tax time) accounts get assigned to forms and line numbers.Remapping a transaction to a different tax line item (e.g. if tax law changes, as it did this year with § 174) is just a matter of updating the account metadata. This is much more convenient than having to go back through the books and reassign transactions to different accounts.It&#x27;s plain text in Git, so I have the usual tools available.

For those respondents, their contributions don&#x27;t preclude them from taking the \"simple tax\" branch when filing taxes. (That&#x27;s the \"simple\" part-- well, one of the simple parts, at least for the employee.)Moreover, there were some changes to simple IRA administration in Secure 2.0 act that make automatic enrollment mandatory (for the employer to do 3% matching or whatever). So the category of respondent I mentioned above-- who technically has a brokerage account but can file simple taxes-- is likely to grow quite a bit in the next few years and decades.Edit: I&#x27;d also be interested in how many people with simple IRAs contribute anything more than the 3% matching-- I&#x27;d bet its more than a majority. Perhaps that could change now that Secure 2.0 lets them contribute to a Roth IRA. replyLordDragonfang 13 hours agoparentprevSee, this is the thing that gets me. For almost anyone who fits in this box, you shouldn&#x27;t have to file in the first place.

(ie. if you do not do this, then you are quite literally paying more than your actual obligation according to the tax code).The government isn&#x27;t aware of your donations or losses, or whatever. So you have to tell them about it. Tax preparation software, historically, was designed to make this process easier by prompting you for all sorts of details you may have forgotten or were un-aware of. In essence, the software was supposed to replace a paid tax professional.Today, most people use Standard Deduction since it was raised so high by the Trump Administration, and the need for credits and deductions has been greatly diminished. However, the need is still there for many folks, and not all tax filings are simple.The nirvana for tax filing would be a single page online that disputes any facts the IRS already knows (such as informing them about donations or the like).

Intuit is the leader in this space, and they haven&#x27;t produced a compelling new feature in decades. They have spent far more of their energy fighting the government to maintain their status quo than doing anything material for their customers. They even have gone as far as to lie to their customers about their eligibility for free filing just to skim a little bit off the top of the lowest earners. Even in the presence of competition, the barrier to entry is so high that Intuit has maintained a virtual monopoly on home tax preparation. They will fight to uphold&#x2F;regain that before they ever fight for you.Yes, there are alternatives, but what possible enhancement could any of them provide that is worth anything? Tax preparation is largely deterministic, and maximizing deductions is a largely human-lead task that is only beneficial to higher earners who have an accountant that does their taxes for them and don&#x27;t care about services like TurboTax and FreeTaxUSA.For most working class Americans a guaranteed free solution provided by the IRS itself is a no-brainer. You know that the government isn&#x27;t in the business of maximizing profits at all costs, and you get the peace of mind that the IRS itself calculated your taxes, and that you are unlikely to get the blame if there is an error.Tax collection is a critical function that the government relies on, it should overwhelmingly be a government-lead process that doesn&#x27;t cost people any more than what they owe in taxes.

The government allowing corporations to profit off of a civic duty like taxation, while offering no free public alternative, just anoints a handful of corporations with the gift of extracting profit from a mandatory governmental process.

I&#x27;m not sure. I guess that&#x27;s where public tax software comes in. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentMost of the inefficiency comes from the implementation rather than the policy, and the use of an income tax rather than a consumption tax.If you had a national VAT instead of a national income tax and the government wanted to subsidize e.g. solar panels, they would simply exempt solar panels from VAT and individuals wouldn&#x27;t have to file anything, they would just pay less for solar panels because the seller wouldn&#x27;t have to collect VAT.The system we have now is unnecessarily complicated because the subsidy is essentially always for something you buy, but then you have to go and file paperwork to deduct it from your income tax. On top of that, then penalties have to work differently -- if you want to impose a penalty on cigarettes then you can&#x27;t just change the amount of the existing VAT on that product, you need a whole new tax with a duplicative collections infrastructure.The justification for this is nominally progressive taxation, but you could get a progressive effective rate curve just by giving everyone a fixed \"standard refund\" (i.e. a UBI) against an otherwise flat rate consumption tax. reply kdmccormick 13 hours agorootparentEverything you&#x27;re saying sounds great, but afaict VAT doesn&#x27;t have the power to rework a society the way income tax does:* Marriage is incentivized via the advantageous married-filing-jointly option.* Donations are deductible.* Employers are incentivized to replace part of wages with benefits packages including health insurance, which incentivizes people to not be unemployed.(I&#x27;m not saying any of this is a good thing, especially that last one :) reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparent> Marriage is incentivized via the advantageous married-filing-jointly option.For 99% of people the 2023 brackets for married filing jointly are just double the ones for being single, and actually penalize two-income married couples in higher income brackets. Moreover, this wouldn&#x27;t even do anything in a system with a flat marginal tax rate.But if you actually wanted some marriage bonus you could increase the amount of the UBI for married couples.> Donations are deductible.So you don&#x27;t charge VAT for donations or let the charity buy things without paying it.> Employers are incentivized to replace part of wages with benefits packages including health insurance, which incentivizes people to not be unemployed.This is definitely not a good thing and should be burned to the ground.

You could have the government provide everyone with unlimited free coal and that would be the end of the private coal mining industry, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should do that.The reason public tax filing software makes sense is that the government imposes this cost on the public so the government should collect the money to pay for it in the usual way (i.e. from taxes paid in proportion to ability to pay) instead of imposing a fixed fee on everyone. reply whyenot 13 hours agoparentprevWill the IRS version also do my state taxes?

Intuit&#x27;s continued existence in this space is dependent on their lobbying team. reply markkanof 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a slightly different issue though. Just saying that because the government has offered a solution to the problem of filing taxes doesn&#x27;t automatically imply that no other organizations that are solving the same problem deserve to exist.I suppose if you are arguing that the one and only reason that tax preparation software is needed is because of Intuit&#x27;s lobbying then that could be true, but Intuit&#x27;s lobbying is only part of what has led to a complex tax code. reply skyyler 13 hours agorootparentYes, the one and only reason tax preparation software is needed for normal people with normal incomes and expenses in 2023 is because of Intuit&#x27;s lobbying. That&#x27;s why people are upset about it. reply chowells 13 hours agorootparentprevSome businesses only exist due to government failure. The solution is to fix the government, not preserve a middleman asking for their cut. reply markkanof 13 hours agorootparentCompletely agree that fixing the government is the real solution, but until that is done, why shouldn&#x27;t private companies be able to produce (optional) tools that make filing easier? reply stetrain 13 hours agorootparentThe comment you originally replied to didn’t say that. reply Macha 13 hours agorootparentprevThe problem&#x27;s continued existence was one they were largely responsible for.

People have been asking for a system where the IRS does your taxes for your, sends you the draft, and you add in any deductions, etc.They already do your taxes in the background to confirm your return is correct, so this is not significantly more work for them (in fact, it is probably less work).In some countries with such a system, unless you intentionally lie, you are absolved of legal liability if the government screws up your taxes.The article makes it sound like they are building a crappy turbo tax clone instead. reply foota 10 hours agoparentThat might take more work in terms of process changes, but the setup would be there. reply RC_ITR 10 hours agoparentprev>They already do your taxes in the background to confirm your return is correctThis is a common misconception. Most places that send you forms also send them to the IRS (but by no means all places). The IRS makes sure that the information you put in your forms is the same as the forms they got, but they know nothing about your dependents, whether you pay mortgages interest, etc.Now, the counterpoint to that argument is that c.90% of people just take the standard deduction anyway now that there&#x27;s not SALT, but the argument there is that we should move completely away from deduction-driven taxes (which is probably the solution).As for TurboTax et al, those places are not sending your forms to every state tax agency (why do people always forget about state taxes in these threads?), so there&#x27;s still very much a need for some solution there. Probably IRS data sharing, but good luck getting all the states to agree with the Feds on tax forms (just look at the SALT battle). reply mdaniel 13 hours agoprevDoes that mean I can FOIA for the source code?

Really, if they cut away 95% of the cruft then it could be dramatically simplified. Everybody has their thing they hold onto for dear life in a tax code. reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentMost of the cruft has been cut out (as of 1986!) People are just so used to accountants and tax programs that they never look at the details to realize how simple their tax situation really is. This is encouraged by the tax industry. reply camdenlock 13 hours agoparentprevPsychological warfare. A direct and personal reminder of our place. reply nemo44x 13 hours agoparentprevWell, you could have done a variety of things that aren&#x27;t reported. For instance, donating money&#x2F;time&#x2F;goods, winning from gambling&#x2F;etc, inheriting money&#x2F;property, winning things&#x2F;money, face deprecation in assets like real estate, etc. Payroll and taxes have about a million edge cases and it&#x27;s one of the reasons payroll is such a bloated industry.I agree it&#x27;s probably a bit much for most people though and not filing should be akin to not reporting anything else and the IRS should automatically calculate your return and mail a check or a bill if you owe. reply 37 more comments...

    "originBody": "Using Goatse to Stop App Theft I recently built a browser-based word game with my friends called Sqword (sqword.com). I'm proud to say that we've been able to maintain a steady group of daily active users over the past 6 months or so despite not doing any real advertising. Vultures will even pick at modest success stories. Yesterday one of my collaborators googled \"sqword\" and to his surprise, there were tons of first-page results that weren't the sqword.com domain. These sites are \"game aggregator\" sites that host your app inside of an iFrame so that they can steal ad revenue from your product. This made me angrier than it should have - not because Sqword is a cash cow - we don't run ads on the site and don't make money from it, it's just for fun - but because it was a passion project with friends, something pure and intentionally free to play WITHOUT ads. It's against my ethos as a developer, there are banners and popups everywhere. If I build an app, I believe it should either be free or it should be up-front about what the subscription or purchase price is (and then not upsell you). I couldn't abide seeing my code monetized in this way. The mature and responsible thing to do would have been to add a content security policy to the page. I am not mature so instead what I decided to do was render the early 2000s internet shock image Goatse with a nice message superimposed over it in place of the app if Sqword detects that it is in an iFrame. It has been one of my greatest achievements as a dev: to live-deploy a massive goatse image to at least 8 domains that aren't mine. Let this be a lesson to you - if you are using an iFrame to display a site that isn't yours, even for legitimate purposes, you have no control over that content - it can change at any time. One day instead of looking into an iFrame, you might be looking at an entirely different kind of portal.",

Some Indian ISPs are kinda notorious in that they&#x27;ll just link to huge image files on third-party sites and just let their 300 million customers hammer the poor site into the ground. I guess it saves them bandwidth, but they also run a huge risk of pissing someone off and have that asset replaced by something nasty. When people use this kind of hard-linking&#x2F;hot-linking of resource I don&#x27;t think they do it to save money or to be evil, I think it mostly gross incompetence.We had an issue where our product images would just be ruthlessly scraped, if there had been some rate-limiting in place we&#x27;d most likely just have allowed it or not noticed. Normally I just pointed the poor scraper to a multi-gigabyte file or funny and unrelated image, if you want to download the same image of a beaver 25.000 times go ahead.But I also seen amateurishly search engines just pound a site to the point where it was easier to just deny all traffic coming from their crawler, as compared to try to reach out and figure something out.

But the only difference would be the degree of suffering inflicted on the innocent bystander. reply jonahx 8 hours agorootparentThe difference is that I rate the amount of \"hurt\" to the viewers as essentially zero in this case, and I think the concern is misplaced pearl-clutching. reply akoboldfrying 6 hours agorootparentAgree for adults.

My position is not that you should \"show young kids goatse\" but that \"a young kid seeing a flash of goatse isn&#x27;t really a big deal\". They might laugh, they might be a little grossed out, they might be curious why someone would do something so strange. I think the idea that they would be \"harmed\" or \"traumatized\" is pure adult projection. reply akoboldfrying 3 hours agorootparentSome apparent dichotomies are false, but \"viewing&#x2F;not viewing an image\" is the real deal. (Do you want to make the case that a small exposure time represents a genuine midpoint between these extremes, to justify treating \"a flash\" of goatse as a special case, distinct from \"viewing\" it? If so, then right now I disagree, but would be interested in hearing your reasons why.)I think there is a genuine change in meaning, coming from your use of the word \"should\":>My position is not that you should \"show young kids goatseBut that&#x27;s not a word I used (or intended).ETA: Agree on images of violence. replyballs187 13 hours agorootparentprevYou’ll feel different about collateral damage when you have children of your own. reply Grangar 12 hours agorootparentGoatse is a right of passage and when my chuldren will inevitably stumble upon it one day I will be there to talk to them about it if they feel a need to.

Baby shark at maximum volume, or a continuous fart sound, or maybe just a high pitched beep would also sufficiently scare away people.By showing porn in a place that he knows minors and other protected groups will visit, they violate decency laws in a whole bunch of countries.

How in the blazes is the choice of that particular image over practically anything else based on anything but its capacity at causing distress?The blog post both acknowledges it as such, and even says \"Let this be a lesson to you\", making it clear that its use is specifically meant to be go beyond stopping people and actively punish them. And even if it weren&#x27;t for that straight up confession, it&#x27;d STILL be patently obvious that this is what they are doing. We are in clear-cut \"shotgun booby trap\" territory here. As others have pointed out, there are subtleties at play over who is ultimately responsible, but the author&#x27;s intent to cause distress is not in question in any way shape or form.As much as it&#x27;s fun to see vigilante retribution like this (and boy is it!), that does not discount the obvious legal exposure at play. reply singleshot_ 14 hours agorootparentSure, that’s the prosecutor’s argument. I think it’s a loser.I think goatse (I arrived on the internet in 1992 or so, so yes, I’m familiar with bothe the giver and the receiver) is somewhat conservative, actually, given the full realm of possibilities. I would be prepared to argue that to a jury in the right jurisdiction. I could convince twelve people who don’t care in New Jersey but probably not Mississippi.I’d be very surprised if any prosecutor thought they’d have a substantial likelihood of a conviction. There is a very high probability that this immature outburst would not be prosecuted or that it would plead to something like disturbing the peace if anything at all.Goatse is the internet’s way of saying “you don’t really want to look at this.” Hell, your parenthetical says as much. reply michaelmrose 11 hours agorootparentprevIs dev actually in the UK?

Probably includes many teenagers and children.* The game aggregator sites are bringing your game to a wider audience. For gamers who don&#x27;t know the name of a specific game they want to play, it&#x27;s nice to be able to browse through a directory of games. The game aggregator sites aren&#x27;t competing with you in terms of Google search results, they&#x27;re adding your game to their collection and sharing their collection with everyone. Yes, they&#x27;re supported by advertising, but I&#x27;d argue game aggregator sites are still generating a ton of consumer surplus. (For example, many users are blocking ads.)If you still want to hurt the game aggregator sites for some reason, just include a message on the game loading screen that says \"play without ads at sqword.com\".

Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer. When Maya Santamaria was opening a Minneapolis club in 2003, a city worker handed her a card for a Minneapolis police officer and said, “You’re going to work with this guy.” To get a business license, a licensing employee told her she had to hire a certain number of off-duty Minneapolis police officers to provide security. Why? “Because they’re racist and we’re Mexican,” Santamaria said. “They didn’t want to let Mexicans have nightclubs.” That’s her conclusion after seeing other similar-sized, white-owned venues escape the same mandate. With over a million dollars invested, Santamaria had little choice. “You gotta do what they say,” she said. Then, MPD “socked it to me,” she said. She started out paying the officers $40 to $45 an hour, always more than one officer per night. And they didn’t just work one or two hours; they charged a minimum of four hours no matter how many they actually worked, she said. The pay gradually increased to nearly $60 an hour. “I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars,” she said. “There were many years I wasn’t making it, and they didn’t give a damn.” Santamaria was later required to come up with security plans outlining the number of officers needed per night. The officers insisted on getting paid cash, she said. She feared if she didn’t oblige, she’d lose her license. Eventually, another officer helped schedule off-duty work: Derek Chauvin. He worked security at her club for 17 years. “They were in charge and everybody had to go through them,” she said. El Nuevo Rodeo became Minnesota’s largest Latino concert venue, and while there were a few brawls, “We never were a problem property,” Santamaria said. MPD officers would usually sit in their squad cars, fully uniformed, and do crossword puzzles or chat with their girlfriends or spouses. Sometimes they’d leave to go help MPD with calls. “They were gone half the time,” Santamaria said. “They were on my payroll but they were gone.” She sold the club in 2019. When Santamaria saw Chauvin pinning George Floyd on the pavement in the video that shocked the world, she recognized both, because Floyd worked as a bouncer inside the club in 2019. El Nuevo Rodeo burned to the ground during the subsequent riots. Santamaria’s allegations about MPD off-duty work are echoed by the experiences of other business owners, documented in government reports and even remarked upon by the city’s new police chief, Brian O’Hara. He said the system is “ripe for corruption,” citing a federal investigation in Jersey City, where a dozen cops were arrested due to widespread corruption of off-duty work. The timing is favorable for more rigorous oversight: MPD is soon to be operating under both state and federal supervision following damning investigative reports about racist policing, and O’Hara is a newish outsider who speaks the rhetoric of reform. Changes to off-duty policy face a key obstacle, however: A 1997 court injunction restricts how much the city can manage officers’ side gigs. Given the injunction, the city can only seek major reforms via the collective bargaining process, which means if the city wants to change off-duty policies, it would likely have to give up something in return. Need to get in touch? Have a news tip? CONTACT US Here’s how the off-duty work program works: Some businesses — like large nightclubs — are required by the city to have security, which until 2020, sometimes had to be off-duty Minneapolis police officers. The city can also require that organizers of large events and businesses plagued with a lot of 911 calls also hire off-duty MPD officers. Businesses may also voluntarily hire off-duty officers for security and traffic control, and negotiate pay and hours directly with officers. The city doesn’t keep track of how much officers are working or how much they’re paid, or even have access to the contracts. Off-duty work often pays a lot more — up to hundreds of dollars per hour — than working overtime for MPD. Some officers are still paid in cash, increasing the risk of tax evasion. And, several business owners and Minneapolis officials said some small business owners — particularly those owned by immigrants — have been led to believe they must hire MPD officers, or risk getting ghosted by police. It was precisely this arrangement that caught the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice in its 2011 report on the New Orleans Police Department. In fact, the MPD off-duty situation has parallels to NOPD before the feds arrived. The recent DOJ investigative report about MPD drew only a passing — but still condemnatory — reference to off-duty jobs. The DOJ was looking for racism. Some business owners of color say look no further. ‘Instead of helping us, they’re hurting us’ Basim Sabri, owner of a Somali mall called Karmel Mall and a Latino mall called Plaza Mexico on Lake Street, said he held a Cinco de Mayo party every year for 27 years to encourage people to come to the area and see that “It really isn’t a war zone, it is a beautiful place.” For years, they never had police there, and then about a dozen years ago, he said, there was a shooting a few blocks away from the event. The city began requiring him to hire off-duty police. “Lake Street has been tremendously damaged, and instead of helping us, they’re hurting us,” said Sabri, who once went to prison for bribing a city council member. The officer rates have skyrocketed, he said. He pays officers $150 to $160 an hour, and a “scheduler” also charges $15 to $20. Despite the big payouts, when he calls the police for help, they don’t always respond, Sabri said. About six weeks ago, a man came into his office with a gun and said he was going to shoot someone. They called 911, but the police never came, Sabri said. An MPD spokesman said “Going back to July 1, all calls we found relating to guns at Karmel Mall did have a police response, and none of the calls match the details” of Sabri’s account. Jonathan Soto, owner of EME Antro night club at Fifth Avenue and Lake Street, hired MPD officers — including Chauvin — to monitor his parking lot for a couple of years, but stopped after Floyd’s murder. The officers wanted to be paid in cash, and would sometimes leave to respond to police calls, which benefited the city, he said. “The city kind of liked that,” Soto said. The FBI interviewed him after Floyd was killed, asking how much he paid officers. Other business owners said the officers don’t always respond to problems right under their noses. Santamaria said the club next to her was tiny but “had to have their own cop,” who she described as an “old guy” who would refuse to help anybody from her club. After several East African-owned stores on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis were vandalized in September 2019, Capitol Café owner Abdirahman Awad called his friend KB Brown, owner of a north Minneapolis print shop and a member of the Main Street Alliance of Minnesota, a group of progressive business owners. KB Brown said the detectives were rude and disrespectful to Awad. Awad said MPD later told him he’d have to pay off-duty officers $145 an hour to provide security. He returned the next night and saw almost no police presence despite the alleged hate crime. In his view, MPD was sending a message that the cafe would only get protection if it hired off-duty officers. “I felt so angry about it,” he said. Kevin Brown, another member of the Main Street Alliance, said Somali business owners have told him MPD pressured them to hire off-duty officers, but they’re afraid to go public because they’ve been threatened with being “blacklisted” by MPD — or ignored when they call police for help. “They get to make the rules,” Kevin Brown said. Not all business owners feel that way, however. When John Wolf bought his liquor store, Chicago-Lake Liquors, in 2000, he inherited the off-duty officers who did security there and continued hiring them. Some officers preferred to be paid in cash, but he said he didn’t do that. One officer scheduled all the shifts, which were 5 p.m. to closing. The cops roved around inside and outside the liquor store and sometimes left to respond to MPD calls — even though Wolf was paying them. Wolf didn’t mind. “I had really, really good people working here,” said Wolf, who appeared with Donald Trump at an August 2020 campaign stop. But after Floyd’s murder, he made a business decision to stop hiring the officers because they were “pricey” and “hard to get.” “The situation became very complicated after George Floyd,” Wolf said. Former council member calls off-duty tactics ‘sleazy and illegal’ In the aftermath of Floyd’s killing, MPD went under a microscope, including off-duty work. Some private businesses and school districts cut ties with the police. Within days, the Minneapolis Orchestra, Minneapolis Institute of Art and iconic club First Avenue said they’d no longer hire them. One of the few things the city does keep tabs on is sites for off-duty work, which must be approved. Officers worked off-duty at about 500 sites in 2018, but that number has dropped to about 100 this year. About 200 officers have worked these gigs this year, according to Regulatory Services Director Enrique Velazquez. In 2020, the Minneapolis City Council stopped requiring off-duty officers at licensed events, and let them hire private security instead. In August 2020, Velazquez told the City Council only four businesses were being required to hire off-duty MPD officers. But some businesses were voluntarily hiring them because they were under the impression they had no choice, he said. Others thought if they hired police officers they would get “some level of preferential treatment,” he said. Velazquez said this was discussed with Mayor Jacob Frey’s off-duty task force, which was launched in January 2020, met twice, and then dissolved. Former Minneapolis City Council Member Cam Gordon said small businesses owned by immigrants told him they were led to believe they wouldn’t get police service if they didn’t hire officers. They didn’t want to speak publicly about it, he said, out of fear of retaliation. Some people of color said they were told if they wanted to get police to respond to 911 calls, they would have to hire the cops for security, and it could cost, say, $800 per night in cash. That’s “sleazy” and illegal, Gordon said. Gordon said running a business using city resources — uniforms, guns, squad cars — without city management, should be considered a violation of the city ethics code, even though the city explicitly allows it, even paying insurance for off-duty work. “It creates this whole system of unaccountability in terms of the money, especially if people are paid under the table in cash,” Gordon said. A 2019 city audit noted cash payment was preferred by some employers and officers. The audit recommended ending cash payments and putting the city in charge of the program, but like so many other MPD issues, change has been glacial. MPD policy was updated to limit hours — including off-duty gigs — and prioritize overtime over off-duty work. MPD is instituting a new timekeeping system to track off-duty hours. The city’s insurance liability for officers working side gigs can get expensive: The city was forced to defend Lt. Mike Sauro after he arrested, handcuffed and beat a 21-year-old college student in a kitchen. Sauro was off duty, working at a club on New Year’s Eve in 1991. A jury awarded the victim over $1 million in damages, the largest civil award in a police misconduct case in the city’s history at the time, according to Human Rights Watch. After that, former Police Chief Robert Olson vowed to limit officers’ off-duty time, saying the city didn’t have the responsibility to make sure private businesses run smoothly. But 28 years later, the off-duty work continues. Even amid the fury after Floyd’s police killing, the council made negligible changes to the off-duty program. Off-duty work is part of the police union contract. The Minneapolis Police Federation said during the last negotiation that any change to off-duty work was a non-starter. Now, negotiations are underway again on the next three-year contract. City may challenge 1997 injunction that ties its hands on off-duty issues Weeks after Floyd’s death at the hands of his officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo withdrew from labor negotiations, saying the contract would be reviewed with the help of outside experts. But even as crime spiked, MPD began hemorrhaging officers, and a judge ordered the city to hire more cops to comply with the city charter. Negotiations were suddenly focused on recruiting and retaining cops. A coalition of police reform groups called Minneapolis for a Better Police Contract formed in 2019 to push city officials to use the police labor contract as a tool for reform. “Off-duty work is corrupt,” said Stacey Gurian-Sherman, a lawyer on the group’s steering committee. The group made 22 recommendations for the contract, including limiting the number of days and hours officers can work, counting overtime and off-duty work. They recommended officers be paid for off-duty work the same way they’re paid for “buyback” work in which neighborhoods or organizations pay for extra patrols. Those officers are paid $107 an hour, but payroll is handled by the city. Aside from labor negotiations, the group says the City Council could make changes to make off-duty work centralized, fair and not subject to the whims of any one police officer. St. Paul, Duluth, Bloomington and Rochester all have such centralized systems. In January, the City Council voted to review off-duty work, including how officers get jobs, how much they’re paid and how it affects MPD staffing. Council Member Robin Wonsley authored the legislative directive and is working on a policy that would charge businesses fees to recoup city costs, but the city is largely powerless given the 1990s era court injunction against changing the side gigs policy. The 1997 injunction and settlement came after former Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton tried to put the system under the city’s control. The union argued changes to off-duty must be negotiated as part of the union contract, and the agreement says officers have the right to contract with outside employers. It also says officers aren’t allowed to act as brokers, though police seem to be ignoring the proscription. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX SUBSCRIBE It would be expensive for the city to take over the off-duty program, however, since officers would be paid through the city, at an overtime rate, and the pay would count toward their pension benefit calculation. Mayor Jacob Frey told the Reformer off-duty work is “one of the more difficult and intractable” issues facing MPD, and the 1997 injunction is a major roadblock to change. Asked whether the city might try to get it revoked, he said, “We’re talking.” The police contract doesn’t give the city much authority over off-duty work, but ideally the city would have more managerial oversight, Frey said. “It will be a topic that is covered,” during negotiations, he said. “It would make the process more fair and equitable both to police officers and businesses hiring them. We could better ensure officers aren’t overworked by factoring off-duty shifts into work scheduling. It would also streamline the process.” Frey said the city needs its officers working more on-duty, rather than off-duty, which he acknowledges will cost more. In other words, pump up their regular pay so they’re less inclined to take the lucrative off-duty work. Minneapolis police officers start out making about $73,000 annually, but many are working mega overtime hours due to short staffing, pushing their salaries sky-high; 70% of officers made six figures last year. Neither the police union nor MPD responded to multiple requests for comment. MPD system mirrors New Orleans, before reforms Many of the concerns about MPD’s off-duty system mirror those federal investigators found in New Orleans when the U.S. Department of Justice found their off-duty work — what they call paid details — facilitated abuse and corruption, contributed to officer fatigue and inequitable policing and was a financial drain on the city. A vestige of the days when NOPD’s starting pay was among the lowest in the nation, paid details became so enticing — with some cops paid $300 to $500 a night to provide security for professional athletes — that some officers were more committed to the side hustles than their actual jobs. NOPD Officers would “ghost” work after roll call, leave in the middle of an investigation, and double dip or use sick leave to do details, the DOJ found. Last summer, the MPD — down 300 officers — struggled to cover shifts. Some officers were doing off-duty shifts rather than overtime for the city. Only a dozen cops were patrolling downtown on weekend night shifts. One night, as a police dispatcher tried to find a cop to respond to reports of a man pointing a gun at people, Lt. Kelly O’Rourke, who was in charge of policing the downtown area, pulled into a parking lot where an off-duty officer was sitting in a squad car, monitoring the lot near nightclubs. The officers make two to four times as much pulling an off-duty shift, so they prefer to do that, O’Rourke said at the time. The DOJ said MPD’s system undermines supervision of officers because patrol officers manage disbursement of the gigs, deciding who gets the work — including supervisors. That creates a disincentive for supervisors to hold those officers accountable for misconduct, the DOJ said. In New Orleans, the officers scheduling off-duty work got extra pay from businesses, making up to $200 per week, the DOJ found. MPD officers also get paid for scheduling off-duty officers. And as in Minneapolis, some New Orleans business owners felt pressured to hire the police. “Businesses sometimes feel they must pay for details to obtain the police services that should be provided by NOPD as a matter of routine policing,” the DOJ said. “In addition, businesses have no way to hold officers accountable when they do not show up for their contracted detail or perform poorly while on detail.” In 2010, New Orleans banned cash payments and began centralizing the system, with mixed results. If the city of Minneapolis fails to reform off-duty work, Gurian-Sherman, the lawyer pushing for MPD reforms, hopes the DOJ forces its hand. “This is happening in full view,” Gurian-Sherman said. “The city has to stop looking the other way.” ‘It’s a racket’ When it became clear that Chauvin and Floyd knew each other because they both worked at El Nuevo Rodeo, the whole world wanted to hear from Santamaria about her two former employees — one dead and one a cop charged with killing him. Later, Chauvin was charged with evading taxes on what she’d paid him. Prosecutors said Chauvin failed to pay taxes on $95,920 he earned doing security for El Nuevo Rodeo between 2014 and 2019. In addition to EME Antro Bar, where prosecutors said Chauvin was paid $250 cash for 3.5 hours, he also worked off-duty shifts at Cub Foods and Midtown Global Market. Chauvin pleaded guilty to two crimes in March, saying he didn’t report the payments due to financial problems, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison. Santamaria — who owns a Spanish language radio station, La Raza 95.7FM — was interviewed by state investigators about her work with MPD. She looks back on those days with disgust. She sensed the city licensing division was in cahoots with MPD to make minority business owners hire the police. “It’s a racket,” she said. “You were damned if you did, damned if you didn’t … you were always having to break the law.” SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

Pressure to hire cops is rampant. &#x27;rent-a-cop&#x27; is not aimed at the fact that security companies apply aggressive mimicry to their people, but that these people are themselves often off-duty cops. Security companies are strongly \"encouraged\" to hire off-duty cops, and find themselves left out to dry or otherwise &#x27;convinced&#x27; if they try to resist.Before you add &#x27;Why don&#x27;t [you|they] do...&#x27; responses, recognize for a moment that the police in the U.S. are largely out of control, have undue control of local government and politics, and have an ideology that enforces self-righteousness and an &#x27;enemy at the gates&#x27; siege mentality, and oh yeah, are able to apply violence at a level unmatched in society. These are not polite people, and the way one &#x27;deals&#x27; with them has far more in common with radical militias rather than state bureaucrats. If you haven&#x27;t encountered that, you&#x27;re just lucky enough to have never threatened their interests. reply edrxty 14 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s pretty eye opening to watch every bill pushed through in the name of firearm safety turning out to have massive exemptions for off duty and retired cops. They&#x27;re such a powerful political force that it&#x27;s outright expected they should have a disproportionate ability to deliver force even after they&#x27;re retired. reply PumpkinSpice 13 hours agorootparentMy favorite part is that California has a roster of handguns approved for sale. The pretext for its existence is consumer safety (it is entirely separate from bans on stuff like assault weapons or large magazines), but the actual effect is that you have a very limited selection in stores, and most of the designs are very dated.But if you&#x27;re a police officer? You get an exemption! Apparently, the state has no regard for your safety as a consumer, and allows you to buy whatever you want... reply edrxty 13 hours agorootparentAnd importantly, as a cop, you&#x27;re allowed to buy off-roster (modern) handguns and then turn around and sell them to the public at a profit. You have to be slightly careful because the ATF doesn&#x27;t like non dealers buying and selling tons of guns, but it&#x27;s a huge racket where cops will make a few thousand dollars a year selling modern&#x2F;desirable guns to the pubilc (through FFLs). reply cvccvroomvroom 10 hours agorootparentprevAnother reason why I left California. You can&#x27;t buy a Canik&#x27;s as a non-LEO. Also, criminals get whatever guns they want and carry them while law-abiding citizens can&#x27;t do anything except wish not to be mugged or murdered with strong objections. It&#x27;s completely absurd given how violent America is. reply pkulak 4 hours agorootparentSo, just so I understand, bad guys all have guns. And you wish you could have one too, for protection against said bad guys. But why is a firefight preferable to a mugging? reply earthscienceman 6 hours agorootparentprevCan you tell me, with sincere curiosity, how you expect being able to buy modern handguns to make America less violent?

They kept adding stuff, culminating in microstamping requirements that no manufacturer could or wanted to comply with - so only a small subset of pre-2007 semi-auto pistols could continue to be sold. reply mcpackieh 12 hours agorootparentprevCalifornia&#x27;s Unsafe Handgun Act is ostensibly intended to protect consumers from cheaply manufactured handguns that might malfunction or otherwise be unsafe to operate.Here is California&#x27;s Attorney General explaining it:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oag.ca.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;attorney-general-bont...> “California’s commonsense gun safety laws save lives, and the Unsafe Handgun Act is no exception,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Accidental shootings are preventable. The fact that children under five are the most likely victims makes these accidental gun deaths even more tragic and inexcusable. As weapons become faster, more powerful, and more deadly, this risk only increases. Flooding the marketplace with unsafe semiautomatic pistols that do not meet necessary safety requirements poses a serious threat to public health and safety, especially for children and young adults.”> The UHA was originally enacted over two decades ago in response to the proliferation of low-cost, cheaply made handguns that posed consumer safety risks. Under the UHA, the California Department of Justice (DOJ) compiles and maintains a Roster of Certified Handguns that meet certain public safety requirements. Generally, a handgun must appear on the roster to be sold by a California firearm dealer.> When the UHA was first enacted, revolvers and pistols were required to have safety devices and pass drop safety and firing tests at independent laboratories in order to be added to the roster. [...] The UHA has since been amended, adding additional safety requirements for semiautomatic pistols including that a new semiautomatic pistol must have:> A chamber load indicator that indicates if the pistol is loaded; A magazine disconnect mechanism that prevents the pistol from firing when the magazine is not inserted; and Microstamping capabilities that allow law enforcement to trace a shell casing to the pistol that fired it.So this law is ostensibly intended to protect people who buy handguns and those around them. But cops are exempt, because... cops never drop their guns? reply b5n 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worth considering that this is the same attorney general who recently doxed all law abiding concealed carry permit holders, applicants, and others (including but not limited to home address, phone, DL number, etc.) many of whom are victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. reply lobf 11 hours agorootparentprevMy point was that a gun doesn’t make you more safe, but the opposite. Anyone talking about buying a gun shouldn’t be discussing safety, they are unrelated concepts. reply mcpackieh 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re [deliberately?] misinterpreting the stated intent of the law. A gun that goes off when dropped is substantially less safe than a gun which doesn&#x27;t. People who buy guns are in fact justified in considering such factors.I think there&#x27;s a real case to be made that the Californian law is duplicitous and is actually intended to reduce the availability of handguns in California, but that&#x27;s not the point being raised here. The point is that for some reason Californian cops are exempt from from the law. That&#x27;s like exempting cops from the lawn dart ban, it makes no sense. reply lobf 10 hours agorootparentWe shouldn’t be doing anything to increase the number of guns in circulation. It reduces safety for everyone, especially the gun owners. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentHo man, that’s like saying we’ll stop war by banning nuclear weapons.1) the really problematic people won’t care2) the ‘normal’ people will just be left defenseless and be preyed upon with fewer worries by the #1 cases.3) which incentivizes the crazies to arm up more so they’ll have leverage.Notably, this is exactly what happened with nuclear proliferation bans, if we’re being honest.Assuming it’s not actually possible to control the area physically anyway. Singapore or NZ? Hey maybe. 99% of the rest of the planet? Good luck! reply MrJohz 4 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re jumping to nuclear weapons as your analogy when gun control laws in other countries make a far better comparison point. Australia is probably a good example here: they have urban and suburban centres in the cities, but they also have vast rural areas. Guns are not banned but limited and regulated. They do not seem to have had this issue where people have been left defenceless by crazy people with guns.In fact, are there any countries that have implemented gun controls that have had this problem? reply lazide 1 hour agorootparentAustralia didn’t have that problem before they banned them either.For countries with major issues who do have strict gun control? Off the top of my head, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa. Plenty more if I looked, I’m sure. reply constantly 8 hours agorootparentprevWhatever your ideology it seems a little craven to not want guns that happen to be out in circulation to be as safe as possible from incidents like misfires from accidental dropping. reply greyface- 10 hours agorootparentprevHarm reduction is a component of public safety. reply lobf 10 hours agorootparentIf your interest is harm reduction, then you should be focused on reducing the number of handguns in circulation.You should also consider looking in to the data about what actually happens to your chances of being shot once you buy a gun. It’s pretty stunning. reply lazyasciiart 9 hours agorootparentHarm reduction is not a single tactic. For gun safety harm reduction means requiring guns not to fire by accident, AND having gun owners take training that includes all the information about the risks that go up once you own a gun (especially to others in your household), AND requiring or encouraging gun owners to lock their guns up AND to store ammunition separate from guns AND ideally even to store them somewhere not in the house, AND reduce the number of guns in circulation. reply greyface- 10 hours agorootparentprevI agree with all of the points you just made, and don&#x27;t wish to be anywhere near a gun, personally. This does not change the fact that there are some people that feel the opposite, and will obtain a firearm regardless. If I can, I&#x27;m going to incentivize them to choose the safer option. reply bryans 8 hours agorootparentprevWhen it comes to drug abuse, harm reduction can mean providing clean needles and other supplies to the user. The person isn&#x27;t going to stop just because they&#x27;re denied clean supplies. In the same way that you can&#x27;t stop people from acquiring guns, but you can help prevent them from purchasing guns that are fundamentally unsafe to operate. replygiantg2 11 hours agorootparentprevMost of the reason for cops being security and being excluded from most firearms safety bills is because rhey already have a credential that was more strenuous to achieve than what the proposed bill is. That training, whether effective or not, is also seen to mitigate risks around litigation when they work security due to how our courts work (how things look can be more important).Although there are other laws that do illustrate what you are saying. reply rpmisms 5 hours agorootparentIn many cases (especially magazine capacity laws, the stupidest of all restrictions), cops are exempt while nobody else is exempt.

I am intrigued but cannot find any use of the phrase other than something to the effect of \"wannabe cop\". Even the 1987 movie by that name is a former cop who works private security (fair warning I have never heard of the movie until reading the wiki summary a few minutes ago). reply ksaho 6 hours agorootparentI asked ChatGPT, unless someone has more info, I will stick with this:The term \"rent-a-cop\" is an informal, somewhat pejorative slang term commonly used in American English to refer to security guards or private security personnel who are not police officers but perform similar functions on a contract basis. It is believed to have originated in the latter half of the 20th century, during a time when outsourcing security services became more common.The compound term itself is fairly self-explanatory: \"rent\" implies that the services of these security personnel can be hired, while \"cop\" is slang for a police officer. Combined, \"rent-a-cop\" serves as a somewhat dismissive descriptor of security guards, often implying that they are a cheaper, less competent alternative to police officers.The phrase is reflective of broader social attitudes towards private security forces and captures tensions between public and private provision of security services. It can be seen as a colloquial expression of skepticism towards the privatization of roles traditionally held by the state. For more detailed information about slang and its social implications, you might find Deborah Cameron&#x27;s book \"Verbal Hygiene\" insightful. For a broader look at how language reflects cultural attitudes, consider reading \"The Power of Babel\" by John H. McWhorter.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;3445bc06-1a92-4886-b886-a0004e... reply cvccvroomvroom 10 hours agoparentprevSome types of publics works projects require hiring police for traffic safety and insurance reasons.In addition, retired police officers often can keep their uniforms and work privately in an official capacity. reply jancsika 10 hours agoparentprev> have undue control of local government and politicsNow, some facts:In North Carolina at least, the Council-Manager form of government provides that the police chief is hired&#x2F;fired by the city manager-- who is hired&#x2F;fired by and reports directly to the city council. Depending on the city&#x27;s charter, the manager may hire&#x2F;fire the police chief with or without approval of the council.Apparently there are a few city councils who have a charter that requires the police chief to be hired&#x2F;fired directly by the city council.This council-manager form is by far the most popular form of city government in NC. IIRC, there are only two other forms allowed by state law-- one is a city council without a professional manager (only an administrator with the elected council making all the important decisions), and one other one which I can&#x27;t remember atm.So on the local level, local sheriffs are hired&#x2F;fired by the local government-- either directly, or by a professional manager who reports directly to the council.County sheriffs are elected in NC. But the day to day goings on in a municipality-- i.e., any politics related to businesses hiring &#x27;rent-a-cops&#x27;-- would be handled by local police officers. (Outside of perhaps one or two counties out of a 100, and unincorporated towns.)Apparently, the council-manager form of government comes from a template for local governments that is used by many other states in the U.S. The only way I can think of that NC is special is that there are no county roads-- only state and town (which, again, puts citizens in contact with local police way more often than county police).In conclusion, the very popular form of council-manager government is counter to your claim that local police have \"undue control over local government and politics.\"> These are not polite people, and the way one &#x27;deals&#x27; with them has far more in common with radical militias rather than state bureaucrats. If you haven&#x27;t encountered that, you&#x27;re just lucky enough to have never threatened their interests.I don&#x27;t have the stats on radical militias. But I&#x27;d wager at least two orders of magnitude lower chance of being killed for threatening retaliation to a police officer in the U.S. than for threatening retaliation to a member of a radical militia.Edit: threatening retaliation, as in their job&#x2F;livelihood, to fit with your general statement \"threaten their interests.\" reply sbarre 9 hours agorootparentAnd yet, stories like this one are not uncommon:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;homicide-detective-st-lou... reply thedaly 19 hours agoprev> Santamaria was later required to come up with security plans outlining the number of officers needed per night.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a simple matter of the public being too complacent.I&#x27;d say that insofar as the protests were unsuccessful, it&#x27;s because their energy wasn&#x27;t being directed strategically. There was so much discussion of \"defunding the police\" without anyone offering a clear, compelling alternative approach to public safety and deterring crime.From a systems-level perspective, telling everyone that police officers are jerks seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nice people place a high priority on being well-regarded by others; jerks enjoy opportunities to abuse their power. The \"ACAB\" slogan exacerbates the problem it describes.One question I wonder about is whether jurisdictions where the chief of police is elected tend to function better than jurisdictions where they&#x27;re appointed by the mayor. There are so many dimensions along which mayoral performance can be evaluated, and public safety is just one of those. By squeezing all the dimensions into a single vote, we&#x27;re limiting the amount of signal that voters can send to their government.I don&#x27;t think policing inherently needs to be a malicious activity. My impression is that police quality is higher in Europe than the US for instance, and that police quality changes depending on which US municipality you look at. One wild idea I sometimes dream about: Imagine if each city had multiple competing police departments, and every cop wore the logo of the department they worked for prominently on their shoulder. Then for each local election, voters vote for one or more logos, and police work + funding gets distributed to the competing departments accordingly. Every time you call to report a crime, it gets assigned semi-randomly to one of the departments, and you&#x27;re told which department got the assignment. Basically, make police brutality and police corruption into a customer satisfaction issue. The very best police chiefs could make millions of dollars starting police companies which effectively served and protected cities across America.Yeah, I know HN dislikes capitalism. But it&#x27;s interesting that policing as an industry has very little capitalist competition -- it&#x27;s entirely organized by the government -- and yet no one seems satisfied with it.

The grandparent comment states:>There are many broken feedback loops right now from the grand (lobbying and campaign finance) to the minuscule (niche price fixing, bribery, police-ran protection rackets), all compounding unfavorably, all seemingly booming.Lobbying, campaign finance, price fixing, bribery, and police-ran protection rackets only relate to free-enterprise competition in the vaguest possible sense (\"they all involve money\").I brought up the logo police idea for discussion because I think it&#x27;s possible that it could align feedback loops better than the status quo. I invite you and everyone else to shoot holes in the idea, and guess how specifically it could fail. It could be that it fails in predictable ways, yet is still an improvement on the status quo.One of my hot takes is that it&#x27;s good to rotate your metric on a regular basis, in order to flush out actors who are purely optimizing for the current metric and nothing else.Unfortunately, any beneficiary of the status quo has a strong incentive to maintain it even if it&#x27;s flawed, and random members of society only have a weak incentive to fix it. That creates friction that prevents rotating metrics.From an incentive engineering perspective, this meta problem seems like the highest-leverage thing to solve. If we could fix that public goods problem, we could keep tweaking incentives on a regular basis and hopefully outrun Goodhart&#x27;s Law faster and better than we are currently able to do.I wonder if mechanisms for solving public goods problems, like dominant assurance contracts, could be helpful here.Ultimately standard left&#x2F;right debates sound pretty tired to my ears. In an ideal world, \"incentive engineering\" would be just as rich of a discussion as \"software engineering\" is today. The current situation is like if every HN post about software engineering was either an argument for why static typing sucks, or an argument for why static typing rocks.

I&#x27;m not at all thinking my flaws are insurmountable, but I think the problem is you are unlikely to get enough data to draw many conclusions, at least in places that aren&#x27;t incredibly dense and crime ridden.I&#x27;m thinking of the suburb outside of LA I live in. It&#x27;s somewhat spread out, and some areas have small amounts of violent crime, while some neighborhoods are incredibly rich and most neighborhoods are gated or have private security etc. Having 3 departments be able to serve such a large land area to ensure that response types are evenly distributed seem challenging.But, maybe in a place like San Francisco (more dense, also more crime) this could work? reply 0xDEAFBEAD 5 hours agorootparentSure, if an area is low crime, I&#x27;d say your policing strategy doesn&#x27;t matter a ton, assuming your cops don&#x27;t engage in police brutality or corruption. Probably in a low crime neighborhood, competing departments would focus on friendly interactions with the public and making really sure that none of their officers look bad in viral videos.I know I mentioned randomization, but I don&#x27;t think uneven distribution is necessarily a problem. Ultimately, a voter who looks at 3 different logos on the ballot is going to think back to interactions they had with the cops, and what their friends tell them about the cops, in order to figure out which logo to vote for. Different voters are going to see different distributions of police presence, but that&#x27;s probably fine. In the same way people tend to vote for the incumbent candidate, I would guess that voters will tend to vote for the logo they see the most in their neighborhood, assuming that logo seems to be doing an OK job.Another way to approach it is that each competing department could have a different service area, and the service areas grow or shrink every election based on election results. This could be done algorithmically by splitting the city in to precincts and finding an assignment of precincts to departments that approximately conforms to the election results, while also keeping service areas for any given logo contiguous through time and space as much as possible (minimize travel and switching costs).All this stuff could work for schools too btw.

There&#x27;s no overlap between Crassus&#x27; strategy and the VFD&#x27;s strategy as described above. The VFD asked you to pay recurring fees just in case your house ever caught fire, and when someone decided that was unlikely, they made it more likely by setting fire to his house.Note that in this strategy, if someone&#x27;s house catches fire, that&#x27;s bad for the fire department, and on top of that it looks like they just committed a crime. The fire department is in the business of threatening people until they pay for a service that the fire department hopes it will never need to provide.Crassus&#x27; strategy is completely different; he operates an actual fire department whose services are not available to other people. If your house catches fire, he&#x27;ll buy it from you.Theoretically, Crassus could benefit from arson too, but he really doesn&#x27;t need it.Crassus is in the business of buying things that have very little value to the seller (who has no way of extinguishing fires) but have a much higher value to him (because he does have a way of extinguishing fires).

If the owner agreed to sell the property, his men would put out the fire; if the owner refused, then they would simply let the structure burn to the ground.

This is a ability the people have given cops because we want them to do it. It is a good thing if they arrest a dangerous person off duty.This brings us back to the problem. We shouldn&#x27;t have laws on the books requiring the employment of off duty cops.

It didn&#x27;t mean they had to hire former police, but they had to show preventative measures were taken above and beyond state level licenses requirements if the board, which had a right to refuse their liquor license, was fed up with the amount of police activity there.It&#x27;s a valid response to say the board should not have had this much power, but the point is that it isn&#x27;t necessarily a racket. reply yohannparis 18 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think you read the article, they were not force to provided better form of security to keep their licence, they were force to hire MPD during business hours. At high costs, under weird pretence of minimum numbers of hours, and most of the time were gone doing MPD work while being paid by the business... This is mafia behaviour. reply heisenbit 17 hours agorootparentMafia knows better than to leave such an obvious papertrail. reply Ajedi32 19 hours agoparentprevYeah, and that&#x27;s where the crime angle to this comes into play. Are the businesses really the \"source of rowdy behavior\", or is it actually the people who frequent those particular establishments? And if the latter, shouldn&#x27;t that be the city&#x27;s responsibility to deal with those people to make sure they aren&#x27;t able to continue to repeatedly act in a disruptive manner requiring a police response? Why are they making the businesses pay for private security?Though as others have pointed out, bouncers have been a thing forever, so maybe I&#x27;m off base here... reply nanidin 18 hours agorootparentThere is a Walmart in my metro area that is responsible for like 80% of all police calls within their municipality. This is the same Walmart that leeches off society in other ways like paying sub-living wages so that employees need to rely on social safety nets to survive. I&#x27;m not sure if they have to hire private security, but this is a prime example of a business that should be securing itself or changing location. reply FuriouslyAdrift 18 hours agorootparentWalmarts are the epicenter of crime in many small towns.They are experimenting with putting police stations INSIDE the store, now.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grocerydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;Atlanta-Walmart-reopen-stor... reply Semaphor 15 hours agorootparentOnly semi related, but we have a synagogue here with it&#x27;s own small police station. But I&#x27;m in Germany, it has been burned twice already. reply SauciestGNU 10 hours agorootparentPardon the insensitive question, but burned twice since the Holocaust? Is violent antisemitism still so prevalent? Did denazification fail so badly? reply ceejayoz 9 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t take a lot of extremists to cause a security threat; \"lone wolf\" scenarios are absolutely something Jewish places of worship have to worry about. Not just in Germany, and doubly so this week.Germany had a far-right coup attempt brewing late last year:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;germany-coup...> German authorities on Wednesday arrested 25 people suspected of plotting to use armed force to storm parliament and violently overthrow the state, marking one of the country’s largest-ever raids targeting right-wing extremists.> Those arrested included a 71-year-old German aristocrat, a former lawmaker from the right-wing Alternative for Germany party and at least one former armed forces member, according to the public prosecutor and officials. reply Semaphor 6 hours agorootparentprevNot insensitive. It’s a bit of a special case. It avoided being burned in 1938 because it was already planned to be sold to the city, thought it was still damaged. Then it came to fame in 1994 when the first arson attack on a synagogue since 1938 was attempted. A second attack happened in 1995 and those responsible were never found.It was completely restored in 2020, which was when the small police station was also added, and has been in active use as a Synagogue again since then. I’d love to see it now, as I have only been inside before the restoration started (guided tour), but I need to figure out how as it’s normally closed to the public behind an electronic gate.There is a Wikipedia page, but only in German: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Synagoge_L%C3%BCbeck> Is violent antisemitism still so prevalent? Did denazification fail so badly?We’ve certainly had our issues, with several big scandals just in recent times, but it’s now once again getting worse in line with right wing extremist ideologies gaining ground world-wide. Jews are, as it has always been in history, getting fucked in particular with both Nazis and some of the extremist Islamic immigrants hating them, and of course also some of the left. reply brvsft 17 hours agorootparentprevSeems inevitable when it replaced all the other retail stores with merchandise you can steal. Where else would I go to steal something in a small town with a Walmart? reply Ajedi32 18 hours agorootparentprevTo me that actually sounds like a clear example of a business that shouldn&#x27;t have to hire private security. At least with bars you can claim that the bar is indirectly responsible for instigating the distributive behavior by serving people alcohol. I don&#x27;t know how you make that argument for a Walmart. reply hunter2_ 18 hours agorootparentI suppose an argument is that if they stop undercutting the prices of smaller businesses, then the rowdy behavior wouldn&#x27;t gravitate toward them, it would be more evenly distributed. But letting the police focus 80% of such efforts there (instead of forcing some sort of change that blurs their focus) might not be a bad thing. reply NickC25 18 hours agorootparentprevThey should be mandated to hire private security. If they are utilizing the majority of the resources available but aren&#x27;t willing to pay the real costs of that, well, they need to suck it up and pay. reply ahtihn 17 hours agorootparentI thought the US was like the most advanced nation in the world? And businesses are supposed to pay for their own security instead of relying on police? What next? Families of murder victims should cover the cost of the investigation? reply NickC25 17 hours agorootparentITT: people defending the actions of a corporation owned by a family worth over 230 billion USD.Businesses should expect that society protects them, sure. But those same businesses can&#x27;t then go and bribe the government to cut worker protection laws, labor laws, can&#x27;t slash wages and expect that the government covers the costs of labor, etc...If Walmart paid their workers lavishly, gave them huge pensions, didn&#x27;t engage in far-right lobbying to diminish worker protections, didn&#x27;t demolish the proverbial Main Street all across America, sure, I&#x27;d give them the benefit of the doubt and say that we should cover their security costs. But look at their actions over the last 35 years....they&#x27;ve enriched themselves greatly as a corporation, bribed the government, and told regular Americans to pound sand. reply sneak 15 hours agorootparentWe are criticizing the government, not defending Walmart.The idea of equal protection under the law is much bigger and more important than a corporation that sucks. Every business should have equal access to law enforcement regardless of how big they are.If law enforcement sucks, it is simply not any private company’s job to address the problem. reply NickC25 14 hours agorootparentIf a corporation donates heavily to anti-government think tanks, funds several union-busting operations, sponsors politicians that write laws that would exempt that corporation from having to pay tax.....then we&#x27;re not criticizing the government, we&#x27;re calling the corporation out for antisocial behavior.If I run a company, make bank, and then use that money to engage in lobbying that would see public services cut significantly, I shouldn&#x27;t get to whine that those same public services (which includes policing) should be protecting my private interests first and foremost. reply WalterBright 17 hours agorootparentprevAnd provided inexpensive goods to the masses. reply NickC25 15 hours agorootparentWalmart is able to provide cheap goods because it can strong-arm providers into taking a loss or operating at a break-even point just for the chance to sell at Walmart. It can also provide cheap goods because they pay their workers jack shit and instruct employees to use government subsidized healthcare and insurance.It&#x27;s totally possible to provide good pay, healthcare, etc... to employees, still have healthy enough margin % to make Wall Street happy, keep the C-Suite well paid, all while providing a great service at competitive prices to consumers. Maybe not enough to enrich the owners to a quarter trillion dollars in net worth, but plenty enough to keep the ship going. Case in point: CostCo. Whole Foods prior to Amazon was another. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparent1. Nobody makes providers sell thru Walmart.2. Nobody makes anyone buy from Walmart.3. Nobody makes anyone work for Walmart.4. Anybody is free to spin up a competitor to Walmart.5. Walmart is not responsible for government wealth transfer programs.> It&#x27;s totally possible to provide [...]You and anyone else are free to do so. reply NickC25 13 hours agorootparentHave you ever been to a small town in America? Outside of a few regions, Walmart is all they have...so that sort of nixes points 2 and 3.Regarding point 4, and your quoting of me - yes, people have. And some have been lucky in that they&#x27;ve made themselves multigenerational wealth in doing so. The guy who founded Costco did it, and made himself over a billion dollars. However, the Waltons have hundreds of times that amount. You can make a billion by doing right by everyone, or hundreds of billions by doing right by everyone not named you. I know what number I&#x27;d be content with, not sure about you though. (Hint: if you give me a billion dollars, I&#x27;m retiring tomorrow)Regarding point 5, Walmart IS however responsible for spending vast amounts of money (generational money) over the years to enact some pretty anti consumer and anti worker laws throughout the country. It IS responsible for funding some crazy far-right politicians. It IS responsible for paying its workers so little that they are \"encouraged\" to go on food stamps and apply for section 8 housing. reply WalterBright 10 hours agorootparent> Have you ever been to a small town in America? Outside of a few regions, Walmart is all they have...so that sort of nixes points 2 and 3.Yeah, I&#x27;ve lived in them. My dad was in the AF, and (to save money) my parents would shop on the nearest AF base, which was maybe 30 miles away. They&#x27;d go once every 2 weeks or so and fill up the car with groceries.The indisputable point is people prefer to shop at Walmart. Nobody makes them.Name one \"far right\" law Walmart got enacted. reply spondylosaurus 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;w&#x2F;walmart-effect.asp reply WalterBright 16 hours agorootparentI shop at Walmart now and then, and benefit from the low prices. So does everyone else who shops there. reply tomcam 17 hours agorootparentprevIn many of the places Wal-Mart has the most problems, both police and private security are sharply limited in what actions they can take against shoplifters. And places like California, Oregon, and Washington won’t prosecute for crimes under about $950.What do you propose Wal-Mart do in these localities? reply brvsft 17 hours agorootparentA lot of people are under the impression that these stores can just eat the cost with insurance, which is, of course, an absurd notion because then the insurance company is losing too much money and will raise the premiums. Then Walmart, etc. can&#x27;t afford the insurance unless they close their most problematic locations.People engage in a lot of magical thinking to justify theft since it seems like a harmless act. Thieves are just trying to feed their families! Insurance will cover it! Etc.! It&#x27;s really unfortunate, they&#x27;re going to learn the hard way as not only Walmart but other retail stores in their areas flee. reply tomcam 11 hours agorootparentIn fact, the insurance companies are now leaving California as well reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprevNo, insurance doesn&#x27;t have to cover it, because even in these cases where large retailers are crying about theft, it&#x27;s still not the primary cause of shrinkage in their businesses! Grocers still lose more product to employee theft or just breaking stuff during handling.Even in California where there&#x27;s some conspiracy theory about how \"It&#x27;s the DAs fault the police aren&#x27;t doing anything\", as if it&#x27;s the police&#x27;s responsibility, or even their jurisdiction, to pick and choose who should go to jail.Cops should be bringing in people violating the law even if nobody ever went to prison! reply scythe 16 hours agorootparentAt least one source gives shoplifting as the plurality of shrinkage at 36%, with employee theft close behind at 30%. But if theft isn&#x27;t prosecuted, this would seem to affect incentives for both shoplifting and employee theft.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lithospos.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shrinkage-in-retail-and-how-to-pr...Together this puts theft at a solid majority (66%) of shrinkage. reply mrguyorama 14 hours agorootparentNo, this puts \"shoplifting\" on the same level as \"employee theft\" and \"literally just doing a bad job\" in terms of losing $100 billion (this is actually a global number) last year. IE, brick and mortar retail reported losing about $35 billion to shoplifting.Out of $6 TRILLION (Just in the US!) worth of brick and mortar retail sales in the same year, in an industry that claims 2% profit margins on the low ends.All the fuss over shoplifting is just noise. Consider that the same survey which produced those numbers also showed that a full 16% of ALL merchandise sold in retail is returned, yet we don&#x27;t have news channels blaring all over that we are in a crisis of unfit products.It&#x27;s a narrative, and a bad one, to blame greedy price increases on a STABLE total rate of shrink, one that has been roughly 1.5% for over a DECADE. The cost of shrink has been factored in to the price of goods forever. reply tomcam 11 hours agorootparent> All the fuss over shoplifting is just noise.You should definitely go to YCombinator and use this valuable perspective to start a brick and mortar retail firm reply scythe 10 hours agorootparentprev>IE, brick and mortar retail reported losing about $35 billion to shoplifting.>Out of $6 TRILLION (Just in the US!) worth of brick and mortar retail sales in the same year, in an industry that claims 2% profit margins on the low ends.So shoplifting is 29% of net profits?

It is algorithmically inevitable. Mark my words. Within the decade. Seasons of the stuff. And it will be pretty good too. reply Verdex 13 hours agorootparentPart of me cannot wait. Like, I really want to see Frasier go on a date with a person who he (and everyone else) is only dimly aware is a xenomorph. We as the audience will see it as a full blown xenomorph and see it kill background characters while Frasier is bickering with Niles about something silly.However, I cannot help but wonder in this presumably inevitable techno future of ours, how we will ever talk to anyone about the eventually fever dream quality of media that we&#x27;ll each individually be consuming in unique niches.I&#x27;m already reading Blindsight and wondering how in the world I can even try to explain this to people in my life. Somehow I imagine that it&#x27;s going to be a lot more difficult to explain why I&#x27;m crying my eyes out after Magneto-Gandalf saves the power rangers from certain death from Venom Frasier and then convinces Frasier to finally take off the black suit. reply kridsdale3 11 hours agorootparentGen Z is all in on Fortnite, where Darth Vader and Spiderman have been battling John Wick and Optimus Prime for years now. reply titanomachy 10 hours agorootparentprevI keep telling people “Blindsight is about vampires in space, it’s awesome and you have to read it” but most people just give me a weird look and ignore the advice… reply 9991 6 hours agorootparentIt has vampires in space, but it’s not about vampires in space.

It&#x27;s something a whole lot of humans can&#x27;t do either. reply greggsy 13 hours agorootparentTo be fair, there’s a significant proportion of sitcoms that are just regurgitated formulas.Some studio is almost certainly feeding sitcoms and standup comedy into some horrific LolLLM, but it would almost certainly reject prompts such as “The gang goes black” or “Frank gets molested”, and the outcome of “The gang makes Lethal Weapon 6” is unlikely to be even half as entertaining. reply kridsdale3 11 hours agorootparentSignificant portion of sitcoms are formulaic yes.

I got maybe ten minutes in. It is the now Kelsey Grammer show. He is surrounded by actors that do not challenge him at any level. In Frasier, it was a groups of actors&#x2F;characters, each of which could carry an episode on their own. Frasier also did edgy stuff, for the time. This new thing is just another rehash of \"old guy revisits past acquaintances\", akin to Picard but without the trek ornamentation and excitement. reply afavour 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t really think you can dismiss an entire show and cast based on ten minutes of viewing.I wasn&#x27;t blown away by the first episode but I&#x27;m interested to keep going. People often forget the the first season of many shows (comedies particularly) are particularly ropey while the writers and actors find their groove.That said I&#x27;m considering it an entirely different show to the previous Frasier, much like Cheers was. I&#x27;m kind of glad they haven&#x27;t gone directly back to the old well. reply jjeaff 4 hours agorootparentAt first glance, I felt they were going for an entirely different show. But, at least the first two episodes seem like a direct rehash of the same story from Frasier. Freddy has taken on the salt of the earth, regular guy persona of Marty Crane, Frasier is himself and starting a new life in a new city, they are moving in together and their personalities clash. You have the free spirited and quirky friend of Freddy as a neighbor to fill the Dafney void. and then of course you have Miles&#x27; son to play the fastidious, nervous, comic relief. I&#x27;m half expecting him to fall head over heals for the neighbor.That being said, I like it so far. reply mdm_ 11 hours agorootparentprev>People often forget the the first season of many shows (comedies particularly) are particularly ropey while the writers and actors find their groove.Parent mentioned Picard, well the first season of ST:TNG is a prime example of this.

If you&#x27;re able to empathize and have a bit of social anxiety Frasier is the most high stakes show ever.The brothers get themselves into the stupidest situations, make asses of themselves, and never come out on top. Its the opposite of Seinfeld( great show). reply Waterluvian 17 hours agorootparentYeah, totally fair. If one is very emphatic to that kind of thing, it can definitely be uncomfortable.What I generally intend by \"harmless fun\" is exemplified by the episode where they buy and ruin a posh restaurant in a day, but you never hear any mention of the financial ruin from that. Whether they&#x27;re super rich or not is simply not explored in the show because it&#x27;s not relevant to the goals of the storyteller. It&#x27;s like a cartoon: they&#x27;ve just got infinite resources whenever a plot calls for it.That&#x27;s quite unlike Bob&#x27;s Burgers, for example, where they&#x27;re constantly pointing out that they can&#x27;t even pay rent on time and there&#x27;s a constant looming anxiety about finances (which to the credit of the show, contrasts meaningfully with how the children are happy and healthy and want for little) reply tomjakubowski 16 hours agorootparent> Whether they&#x27;re super rich or not is simply not explored in the show because it&#x27;s not relevant to the goals of the storyteller.What??

But it has to be a situation where it feels \"unfair\". When Frasier or Niles make fools of themselves it&#x27;s always because of their own pretensions, not anyone else&#x27;s. reply maximinus_thrax 12 hours agorootparentprev> “cozy TV”This is totally it.

They were teeth-gnashingly similar.This is the head writer of Park Street Under.

But that&#x27;s not what I had assumed when I read the word \"plagiarized\" in OP&#x27;s comment.(To the head writer&#x27;s credit, he never used that word.)Edit: clarification reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentThanks for that read! Some key quotes:> Cheers director James Burrows has long denied his show was lifted from Park St. Under, maintaining that it was inspired by Duffy’s Tavern, a radio program created in the 1940s by his father, Abe, a Tony Award–winning humorist and writer. The troika of Cheers creators... claimed to have modeled the Cheers bar on Boston’s Bull & Finch, which they visited while developing the sitcom.> The similarities between the two make an argument for some kind of influence. The question of whether Cheers took something from Park St. Under, however, obscures something vital: As special as the little Boston sitcom was, and there’s reason to think it was truly loved, it was never going to be Cheers. It had its shot. ABC Entertainment president Tony Thomopoulos... told Bennett, “I like them, but I just want to tell you they’re really not deserving of being on the ABC network level.”> One reason, perhaps, why the legend lived on so long is that Cheers affirmed that there really was something great about Park St. Under.> To me, the things that are so lovable about Park St. Under—the local feel, the rough-around-the-edges inside jokes that make it seem familiar—aren’t the things that made Cheers such a hit.... With its production woes and shoestring budget, she didn’t even think season two of Park St. Under was likely to happen. The claim that Cheers made off with a ready-made hit misses what the local show really was—the good and the bad.> Does this mean the legend is finally done? Doubtful... The claim that Cheers looted the show is just too juicy and has been part of local legend for too long to be forgotten entirely. reply 5cott0 16 hours agorootparentBurrows wasn’t the writer, the Charles bros were. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentFrom Wikipedia:> Three men developed and created the Cheers television series: Glen and Les Charles (\"Glen and Les\") and James Burrows, who identified themselves as \"two Mormons and a Jew.\"> The original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a concept similar to The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The creators considered making an American version of the British Fawlty Towers, set in a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the radio program Duffy&#x27;s Tavern, originally written and co-created by James Burrows&#x27; father Abe Burrows. They liked the idea of a tavern, as it provided a continuous stream of new people, for a variety of characters.> Early discussions about the location of the show centered on Barstow, California, then Kansas City, Missouri. They eventually turned to the East Coast and finally Boston. The Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a phone book. When Glen Charles asked the bar&#x27;s owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he agreed, charging $1.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cheers#Production reply ylee 10 hours agorootparent>Three men developed and created the Cheers television series: Glen and Les Charles (\"Glen and Les\") and James Burrows, who identified themselves as \"two Mormons and a Jew.\"I served my LDS mission in Nevada.

I wrote the book Success Through Fear. [Audience laughs.]…I live in the South End, so perhaps I can help you. And I’m a psychologist, so I’m qualified to help you. And I’m sympathetic, so I’d like to help you. Can I help you?”I love the line about \"Success Through Fear.\"I&#x27;d be curious to know if Dorfman had a Boston accent. Frasier&#x27;s character worked because he was an outsider to Boston. Also, IIRC his references to psychiatry were supposed to come off as earnest-- and often pretentious-- setups for the other characters&#x27; punch lines, unlike this quote. reply tomjakubowski 16 hours agorootparentDorfman&#x27;s tone lacks the subtle disdain Dr. Crane has for his radio callers.I think one of the most interesting things in Frasier is his struggle to find his identity, between radio host and psychiatrist.

He means well, but typically only if it also benefits him. That tends to be most protagonists in sitcoms though. Frasier was a static character and didn&#x27;t really grow as the show went on.Compare that with Niles who grows throughout the show after losing everything.

Now. October 16, 2023 · 6 min read We have come to a point where end-to-end encrypting all your private data and private communications is no longer an ethical option, but an ethical duty. Imagine a new law was being discussed in your country to make it mandatory that all buildings have glass walls. All houses would be transparent. The (stated) goal of the law is to make it harder for criminals to hide their wrongdoings. It would be difficult to stock up on illegal drugs or to operate an industrial printer of counterfeit money without the police (and, incidentally, some of your neighbours) noticing. Domestic violence and child abuse would be visible through transparent walls. Let's say that the new law will allow you to have a shower curtain, a little folding screen in your bedroom, and blankets on your bed. Except for those meagre provisions, assume that your government (and random passers-by, and potentially anyone) will be able to watch what you do at all times. Now imagine you are a regular, law-abiding citizen who can afford to lead a “transparent” life most of the time, and manage to get some limited “privacy” only occasionally. Given how hard it is for individual citizens to steer the behemoth that is the State and its government, and since you personally “have nothing to hide”, you could be tempted to simply give up and prepare to obey the new law. But you should resist. You should strongly oppose that bill and help build resistance to it. Most importantly, if such a law ever came into effect you would be morally obliged to disobey, to boycott. Under such a law, good people in need of privacy would be at risk. Whistleblowers, investigative journalists, clinical doctors and psychologists and other health professionals, lawyers, the courts, the police, the military and spies absolutely need secrecy (to varying degrees, and at different times) to do their job. Some scientists and engineers need strong privacy, too (those in charge of vital infrastructure like the electrical grid or the backbone of the internet, gain-of-function research, nuclear tech, or cybersecurity). And some people need secrecy to be physically safe: prosecuted minorities, sexual dissidents, opposition leaders, activists, heterodox thinkers, people who are divergent in many ways. Enter the European Commission's “Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Laying Down Rules to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse”: Mullvad VPN: “The European Union is about to implement legislation that will mean all your communication will be monitored. You probably haven’t even heard of it.” Patrick Breyer, MEP: “Chat Control: The EU's CSEM [child sexual exploitation material] scanner proposal” The European Union is a heterogeneous group of 27 countries. Some of its member states, like Hungary and Poland, are still immature barely-liberal regimes with more than a whiff of political repression (“flawed democracies”). As recently as last year there was strong evidence of “attempts by national security services to illegally access information on political opponents through their phones” in those two countries. But not even the most robust democracy in the world (another European country) should be trusted with a fundamentally unethical law like Chat Control. In light of alarming proposals like Chat Control, everyone should make the effort to escape the opaque protocols and the convenient Trojan Horses that are popular social networks and messaging services, and make their daily communication truly private. We should make strong encryption a staple of our digital life. We should all use PGP, SSL or equivalent tools; VPNs, Tor and/or SSH tunnelling; IPFS, or other distributed file systems — and ditch proprietary OS's in favour of Linux or truly free Android distros. We should switch to Protonmail or similar webmail; to Matrix, Signal or similar messaging. Ad-blocking, URL cleansing and third-party cookie rejection should be the default for everyone. Those tools and techniques should cease to be arcane nice-to-haves for nerds: we must get more non-technical people onboard. All this is a moral imperative to those of us who have the ability and the means to follow this strategy and to educate others about it. As long as we still have access to computing resources, free software and some form of encrypted tunnelling, we can resist: those are the minimum requirements for a humanist digital environment to sustain itself. In the future it might be that by developing and using some software and exchanging certain sequences of bits we will be breaking some law. Such a law would be wrong and unjust. More than twenty years ago, some of us were sprinkling our regular e-mail with words like “iraq”, “bomb” and “attack”, often on a line appended to the end of messages, in response to talk about TLAs scanning all digital communication in the wake of the “war on terror”. I don't know if that strategy was effective in the end, but the goal we pursued with it was right. In the same spirit, today everyone should communicate safely in private, if only to erect a collective smoke screen that will confuse the mass surveillance apparatus and protect the most vulnerable among us. (For similar reasons, everyone should choose free software when that's feasible; demand open source and open standards and document formats from all public institutions; and defend blockchains — including cryptocurrencies — and the “right to repair”. Strategically though, it may be better to stick to a minimum set of common demands for the sake of building the largest coalition possible now.) There is strength in numbers: that's how civil disobedience works. It would be naive to think that we can get everyone in the EU to understand the imminent threat of (even deeper) mass surveillance and to act on it. But if a significant fraction of European citizens recognised the seriousness of the situation and made the little effort required to secure their data and their communications, there is no way a law like Chat Control could be enforced.

Some philosophers think it exists (usually called \"natural law\" [1]), while many others think it&#x27;s nonsense.I would guess that most anthropologists, for instance, would say it&#x27;s rubbish -- people who have studied the exceedingly wide variation in what is considered moral or immoral across cultures. A duty in one community may very well be a prohibition in another.But you don&#x27;t need to believe in any kind of \"permanent ground truth\" law in order to \"break laws and throw rocks at the police\".

It legislates the following blanket prohibition:> [Lev 18:16] Do not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is the nakedness of your brother.> Here the text forbids a brother from marrying his brother’s wife, ostensibly even after the brother has died. No exception is noted for the brother’s childless widow.> This problem so bothered the Sages, that they list it within a collection of contradictions in the Torah whose reconciliation is a feat so intangible “that the mouth is unable to utter and the ear unable to hear\"> The cumulative evidence suggests that P&#x2F;H did not consider yibbum an option, and likely repudiated it. Perhaps the Priestly authors did not feel that incest should have any exceptions—yibbum, which involved a woman marrying her brother-in-law, is at its core incest with an “indulgence.”[5]> [5] The Sages seem aware of this problem. See, for instance, Tosefta Yebamot 6:10 (cf.

Laws may exist, but if some people are not be bound by them, and are able to wield the laws however they wish (we call these people tyrants), then you don’t truly have rule by law, you are rule by arbitrary will. In order to have rule by law, the law must be the source of power itself, and must apply to all people equally.This is where resistance to unjust laws or unjust authorities comes in. When people use their authority to put themselves above the law or excised use the law in an unjust&#x2F;unequal manner, then we are stepping outside the bounds of the rule of law itself. The law is reduced to a mere tool of oppression rather than a source of legitimate authority.A corollary to this, as mentioned by another commenter, is the concept of so called “natural law”, that is law that exists as an antecedent to human law or is given by god&#x2F;some other non human source. Note that rule of law is not the same as nor is it dependent on a concept of natural law.

I don&#x27;t think technical people should go around giving unsolicited lectures to people they perceive as lacking technical expertise. However, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with technical people sharing what we know in a respectful way to people who are actually interested in a way that accounts for their needs. For example, if a social group you&#x27;re in is deciding what messaging app to use to coordinate meeting up, it would be appropriate to share what you know about the various options&#x27; end-to-end encryption. But going on a rant about the privacy issues of a social media app because a distant relative mentioned it offhandedly probably isn&#x27;t productive.By analogy, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a friend with medical training sharing what they know about heatstroke prevention to a group of us before we embark on an hike. I would mind them giving me nutrition advice based solely on what I ordered at a restaurant.(Edited to fix wording) reply salawat 17 hours agorootparentprevI find the opposite.

These technologies aren&#x27;t limited to just government surveillance, so I&#x27;ve been saying for ages now to anyone who will listen that we need to massively alter our \"common sense\" attitudes to crime and punishment before organised crime starts using it to automate mass-scale blackmail: a judge or a police officer snorting cocaine would be demonstrating poor judgement just to perform the act, let alone as a result of the drug itself, but society is much worse off if a mafia records them doing it so they can get their people off the hook for bigger crimes.And no, governments can&#x27;t just use such surveillance to arrest everyone who breaks the laws: my go-to example of this is heroin in the UK, because as far as I can tell nobody defends heroin, yet enough people use it (200k) that fully enforcing the \"no possession\" law for that substance alone and nothing else would nearly triple the current UK prison population (95k, though I&#x27;m assuming that at most only a small percentage of them are currently getting heroin into their prison).I don&#x27;t know what the best way to approach things like this would be, only that it&#x27;s not going to be an easy thing that can fit into a comment box — the best I can do is say that my vibe is instant-and-tiny penalties, so a speeding offence might be £0.1&#x2F;minute&#x2F;(MPH over the speed limit)&#x2F;(thousand pounds of monthly disposable income) or something like that. reply _Algernon_ 20 hours agorootparentprevThat would instantly eliminate all eCommerce.

I would take those classifications with a pinch of salt. Both the Hungarian government and the Hungarian people are seeking to keep their cultural values, and&#x2F;or traditions. Telling them to do this and that to undermine it is going to be responded to with criticism. Of course the West and especially the EU hates them. In fact, Hungary is being extremely hated for staying neutral with regarding to the Ukraine-Russia war, and refusing to send weapons or money for weapons to Ukraine. Yes, Hungary is hated because of its pacifist views. Now, would you ever take anyone seriously if they hated Hungary for not supporting and refusing to fuel the war? They think that Hungary is a flawed democracy because (and maybe for other reasons as well) the Hungarian people (!) keep voting for Orbán. reply mbork_pl 43 minutes agorootparentprevThanks.

The definition of marriage as a union of one man and one woman is fortunately written into Polish constitution, which is quite difficult to change, so there&#x27;s that. (Also, not calling a same-sex relationship a \"marriage\" does not really violate anyone&#x27;s rights.)> Access to abortion was further limited.Which - given how abortion is basically killing innocent human beings - is a huge step towards freedom (more precisely, the right to live).EDIT: also, I love how you mention Spain time and again.

You must be reading the media that push the narrative a country is democratic if allies of EPP(the largest EU party) win the elections there consistently otherwise it is a horrible autocracy. Imagine people actually voting for who they want for and these people than rule, without asking Brussels for permission! What audacity! They even had the audacity to veto ACTA (remember that)!It is extremely funny the ruling party that is called \"undemocratic\" after ruling for 8 years in Poland has now(last Sunday) essentially lost power in democratic elections with the highest voter turnover ever. If this is what happens in a \"flawed democracy\" I&#x27;d not want to live in an \"unflawed one\".Also, you seem to be against the overtly autocratic laws proposed by the EU commission like this monitoring law. Perhaps you don&#x27;t know the party that just has won the election in Poland (the so called \"democratic opposition\", why democratic? Because democracy is only when they win of course.) is led by Donald Tusk, who was the leader of the previous EU council and is&#x2F;was the deputy of EPP, the biggest party in Europe (guys that want to pass the law you&#x27;re so much against).So where did these \"undemocratic\" claims come from? In Hungary allegedly there are some curbs on freedom of speech etc. But in Poland? No, the biggest proof is that there are plenty of opposing media (that&#x27;s why the opposition won).So why?Well. The EPP-aligned Po party in Poland when they miserably failed the elections in 2015 immediately started claiming the now ruling party is \"undemocratic\" (*both parties actually broke the constitution regarding the highest court so there was a typical \"pot calling kettle black\" situation - that wasn&#x27;t even the biggest argument, the biggest argument was that they were \"power hungry\" by rightfully and legally taking power in a country where the majority voted for them by electing their own officials into various state enterprises etc - stuff every single party did before and will do after).Time has passed, the ruling party has made stupid mistakes, they pissed lots of people by being too religious and pushing their worldview on everyone including myself(for example the high court members elected by them made a ruling you can&#x27;t abort a pregnancy just because the foetus has a deadly disease, it has always been legal to abort if the mother is in danger) on everyone, but what they also did is they actually fulfilled a number of promises they made prior to the elections. Perhaps that is normal where you live, but it Poland it wasn&#x27;t. It was normal not just to completely forget all your promises, but to pass laws directly opposing them. They were the only party that actually did what they said they will, also they found and stopped corruption and vat fraud that amounted to 50% more money in the budget during their rule, huge number of roads, motorways etc were built. Also they (called \"far right in the west, funny again\" increased child benefits essentially getting rid of child poverty). So they won the next election. They continued doing what they did before, but then covid happened and they made stupid mistakes, they were suspicions of corruption on buying respirators etc. Then Russia and Belarus started picking up tens of thousands of people from middle east and africa, flying them to Belarus (for between $5k and $50k per head depending on \"class of travel\") and forcing these people to attack the polish border in hope Poland will take them in, they will cause mayhem like everywhere else in Europe unconstrained illegal immigration happened turning Poles anti-immigration (guess why, they were hoping well close the borders on Ukrainians). These were people from mild climate countries being dropped in a middle of a forested area with bogs, rivers etc in winter. They were told if they want to get to Germany they have to attack Polish border guards and they did and still do. Why don&#x27;t they just ask for asylum in Poland, asking the first border guard they meet? Because they want to go to Germany and asking for asylum in Poland means they would be sent back to Poland by the Germans. Until now Polish border guards have saved over 200 people that were stuck in swamps, or having hypothermia etc. They got free heathcare in Polish hospitals. How many if them claimed asylum in Poland? Less than 50. What happened to the rest? They preferred to be dropped of on Belarusian side of the border hoping to try again to cross illegally later.In this environment the opposition started making baseless claims about \"the forest service building mass graves pits\" and other bullshit(despite there being lots of humanitarian organisations there illegally), the government instead said they&#x27;ll build a 180km border wall in 6 months. The opposition said it will never happen, then the wall was built.Then the war in Ukraine started and specially in the beginning they handled it very well too. Not only Ukrainians were given the same heathcare and rights to work and run businesses like Polish people, but they got the same benefits. Every single government service in Poland has been translated into Ukrainian. 250k Ukrainian kids went to Polish schools. Poland led by that party was the first country to send 200 tanks to Ukraine, anti helicopter rockets, electricity via a new 500kV interconnector and the government did everything in its power to shame pro-Russian countries like Germany and France to help until they did start helping.Then the inflation happened, still thanks to good economic policy Poland survived it with one of smallest unemployment rates in Europe. Now the inflation is dropping and people forget about such things when times are better.However, this \"undemocratic\" ruling party that won the elections twice (not in a landslide - 90% Erdoğan&#x27;s Turkey style, but in difficult coalitions both times) seemed to became tiered. The campaign focused only on how Tusk was a horrible corrupt prime minister before, that he was openly Pro Putin&#x27;s Russia until it wasn&#x27;t possible anymore and that his first party was funded illegally by German CDU (it is illegal for foreign organisations to fund parties). Younger people didn&#x27;t remember his rule and the crapoy campaign from the \"undemocratic\" ruling party in connection with that it is unlikely to win for the third time meant they lost. They, as a single party, got the most votes, but the \"democratic\" opposition has more votes together so they basically lost.As for the stupid claims of spying on \"opposition and some journalists\" the only proof is that pegasus was found on their phones and one of these people was being investigated at the time (in connection with illegal party funding). How do you know it was Polish police that used Pegasus and not Russia, Israel or any number of other countries? And if they did, what proof is there for it being done illegally? If it happened it required court order and if it did well know everything about it now that the \"undemocratic\" government lost power in democratic elections. reply charcircuit 18 hours agoprev>If you don&#x27;t have something to hide someone else might have something to hideI don&#x27;t find it ethical to fight for the privacy just to protect criminals. reply kevdev 10 hours agoparentYour argument assumes a just state that will not outlaw things like dissent against the government, being LGBTQ, etc. Plus, having something to hide does not automatically mean you are doing something criminal.

People want to feel good, and right, and justified. The more pain they are in, the more true it is. People don’t like pain. When it gets really bad, they look for scapegoats and seek comfort in delusion, anger, etc.There is a balancing act in here somewhere. Frankly though, looking at history as best as I can - the wheel exists, and the analogy of the wheel is so apt because it does keep going in cycles.

It might be explained in part by Ishkur&#x27;s own age &#x2F; detachment. It matches my own experience but I expect I am a similar age.Is it true that there just aren&#x27;t any major new genres and subcultures with music? I know people will respond with \"I love new genre X\" which will turn out to be a handful of bedroom djs on soundcloud. There needs to be some notability standard for a genre which IMHO is that there are multiple clubs that specialise in it and larger clubs have a regular night for it showing some general appeal. Anything else is just some micro-niche that should be categorised under an existing genre. reply NoboruWataya 54 minutes agoparentThe internet has probably allowed for smaller niches to develop and survive. Years ago, no one would bother making new genre X music in their bedroom because no one would hear it. Now they do. So arguably your notability requirement for genres is a bit outdated and maybe is why it seems like there are no new genres or subcultures. It&#x27;s possible the genres and subcultures are just smaller and less visible now.Disclaimer, I know nothing about DnB. I&#x27;m just commenting on how it seems a lot of things have developed in recent years due to the pervasiveness of the internet. reply leokennis 57 minutes agoparentprevOne big development in \"dance music\" is the music coming from Africa.

Sure, one could argue that some stuff is \"wrong\" but does it really matter when it&#x27;s all so arbitrary anyway? I&#x27;m more interested in Ishkur&#x27;s take on things than 100% correctness.FWIW I also don&#x27;t think artists themselves should be some kind of final arbiters on what genre their music is; \"death of the author\" and all that.

A professor of Physics gets drunk and is talking to an English teacher, telling him how he can bring people from the past to the present. At first it sounds like a drunken, but good story, but he explains that older scientists were unable to wrap their mind around the world as it is now, so he needed a more adaptable, universal, creative mind, and brings Shakespeare, who adjusts well.Eventually he enrolled Shakespeare in a night school class on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays—taught, as it happens, by the English teacher, who begins to become genuinely worried. He recalls a bald man with an unusual accent, and starts to doubt whether the story was all alcoholic fantasy. Timidly, he asks what happened, and the physicist explodes with anger. Shakespeare had been humiliated, he says, and had to be sent back to 1600: \"You poor simpleton, you flunked him!\" reply jjgreen 10 hours agorootparent... a bald man with an unusual accent ...People forget that Shakespeare was a Brummie. reply cdelsolar 9 hours agoparentprevI emailed him once like 20 years ago to tell him he was missing \"cyber trance\" (with a couple of examples), which is a genre and he rudely replied that it was not a genre. reply Cthulhu_ 13 hours agoparentprevGenre is subjective to a point though, like people including the artists will argue about what genre something is and there will be no consensus or any authority that says \"it&#x27;s this genre\".

    "originBody": "Advertisement Skip to content HOMEABOUT THE AUTHOR ADVERTISING/SPEAKING Tech CEO Sentenced to 5 Years in IP Address Scheme October 17, 2023 5 Comments Amir Golestan, the 40-year-old CEO of the Charleston, S.C. based technology company Micfo LLC, has been sentenced to five years in prison for wire fraud. Golestan’s sentencing comes nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to using an elaborate network of phony companies to secure more than 735,000 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), the nonprofit which oversees IP addresses assigned to entities in the U.S., Canada, and parts of the Caribbean. Amir Golestan, the former CEO of Micfo. In 2018, ARIN sued Golestan and Micfo, alleging they had obtained hundreds of thousands of IP addresses under false pretenses. ARIN and Micfo settled that dispute in arbitration, with Micfo returning most of the addresses that it hadn’t already sold. ARIN’s civil case caught the attention of federal prosecutors in South Carolina, who in May 2019 filed criminal wire fraud charges against Golestan, alleging he’d orchestrated a network of shell companies and fake identities to prevent ARIN from knowing the addresses were all going to the same buyer. Prosecutors showed that each of those shell companies involved the production of notarized affidavits in the names of people who didn’t exist. As a result, the government was able to charge Golestan with 20 counts of wire fraud — one for each payment made by the phony companies that bought the IP addresses from ARIN. Golestan initially sought to fight those charges. But on just the second day of his trial in November 2021, Golestan changed his mind and pleaded guilty to 20 counts of wire fraud in connection with the phantom companies he used to secure the IP addresses. Prosecutors estimated those addresses were valued at between $10 million and $14 million. ARIN says the 5-year sentence handed down by the South Carolina judge “sends an important message of deterrence to other parties contemplating fraudulent schemes to obtain or transfer Internet resources.” “Those who seek to defraud ARIN (or other Regional Internet Registries) are subject to costly and serious civil litigation, criminal charges, and, ultimately, a lengthy term of incarceration,” reads a statement from ARIN on Golestan’s sentencing. By 2013, a number of Micfo’s customers had landed on the radar of Spamhaus, a group that many network operators rely upon to stem the tide of junk email. Shortly after Spamhaus started blocking Micfo’s IP address ranges, Micfo shifted gears and began reselling IP addresses mainly to companies marketing “virtual private networking” or VPN services that help customers hide their real IP addresses online. Golestan did not respond to a request for comment. But in a 2020 interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Golestan claimed that Micfo was at one point responsible for brokering roughly 40 percent of the IP addresses used by the world’s largest VPN providers. Throughout that conversation, Golestan maintained his innocence, even as he explained that the creation of the phony companies was necessary to prevent entities like Spamhaus from interfering with his business going forward. There are fewer than four billion so-called “Internet Protocol version 4” or IPv4 addresses available for use, but the vast majority of them have already been allocated. The global dearth of available IP addresses has turned them into a commodity wherein each IPv4 address can fetch between $15-$25 on the open market. This has led to boom times for those engaged in the acquisition and sale of IP address blocks, but it has likewise emboldened those who specialize in absconding with and spamming from dormant IP address blocks without permission from the rightful owners. The U.S Department of Justice says Golestan will serve 60 months in prison, followed by a 2-year term of court-ordered supervision. The Micfo CEO also was ordered to pay nearly $77,000 in restitution to ARIN for its work in assisting federal prosecutors.

Because the semi was contracted by the postal service, they had the requisite security: tags, seals and the magical panic button in the cab of the tractor. The driver pushed the button when the state&#x2F;city police broke the seal and started rummaging through parcels which summoned the inspectors, guns drawn to the scene. Apparently the Postal Inspectors arrested the -police- at that scene on breaking and entering mail facilities.Some of the details pertaining to why the shipment was actually legal and the police didn&#x27;t have cause&#x2F;jurisdiction yadda yadda yadda I don&#x27;t remember, but still a good story even if the telling of it by my former colleague was more engaging than I can recount. reply Arrath 15 hours agorootparentThat reminds me of a story from a good friend who works in the Idaho National Labs, which have some areas under rather tight security.As the story goes, one of the scientists there copped a warrant high grade enough for the Federal Marshals to come by and make an arrest. They were stopped at one of the gates into a more secure area, asked their business, and told that security would send out the person in question. The Marshals balked at this and demanded to be let in to make the arrest, lest the fugitive make good an escape somehow. After security asked for their requisite clearance, which the Marshals could not provide, it continued to escalate. Fingering their pistol butts, the Marshals insisted they were on lawful business and must be let in, while the guards with rifles replied that by all means the Marshals might make their entry but as armed intruders into a secure laboratory they would promptly get shot.The pissing match took long enough that the fugitive was finally marched up to the gate and taken into custody before it could escalate further, at this point I believe the Marshals were on the phone with their higher ups trying to plead their case to be let in. reply kens 12 hours agorootparentThe version of that story that I read is much longer, by Funranium Labs.

So when a case actually does fall under their jurisdiction, they execute their duties \"with extreme prejudice\", so to speak. Assuming the story from the OP you replied to is true, the fact that they arrested the police officers would show how seriously they take their duties, even if the officers tampering with the mail was due to carelessness while they themselves were performing their duty. reply Ichthypresbyter 1 hour agorootparentI think that every Department of the US Government (and AFAIK most if not all of the independent agencies) has at least one armed law enforcement agency, though in many cases all it does is ensure the security of the department&#x27;s buildings and protect against corruption by its employees. reply tharkun__ 10 hours agorootparentprevThis makes a lot of sense to me.It&#x27;s a psychological thing as far as I have been told.

You should have seen how fast the security guy got up from his chair and started shouting at the guy what the... he was thinking just grabbing that list!

You can never have too many... reply KMag 16 hours agorootparentBack around the turn of the millennium, there was a company called AllAdvantage. They paid you to install spyware&#x2F;ad injection software and watch you browse, and sold the add space and analytics to corporations. They&#x27;d pay you for... I think it was 48 hours of ad-injected spied browsing per month, and then stop paying you (but keep injecting ads and spying on you). There was also a pyramid aspect where you&#x27;d get something like 10% of all of the amount earned by your direct referrals, with no monthly cap. Also, 48 hours of browsing wasn&#x27;t enough to hit their minimum threshold for AllAdvantage to mail you a cheque.Edit: maybe there wasn&#x27;t actually spyware and it just injected extra banner ads in your browsing. I never looked into installing it myself.A &#x2F;16 subnet was routed to our fraternity house, licensed to house up to 22 people. 65,536 (minus broadcast, gateway, and network address) IPv4 addresses for 22 people. My roommate bought 1 GB of RAM (about $4k at the time) and a VMWare student license for his Linux desktop. He cut down Win95 to be able to run in 32 MB of RAM (including his COM scripting bot, Internet Explorer, and the AllAdvantage spyware). I seem to remember him configuring the VMs to run 16-bit color to save memory footprint. He scripted the Win95 boot process to read a CSV file off of NFS, remove the top line, and write the file back. The CSV file contained fake name, fake address, etc. The VM would register itself with AllAdvantage, with my roommate as the referrer, and then randomly click on links in Internet Explorer until hitting the payout limit, and then shut down the VM. A Perl script (remember the late 90s?) on the Linux host would re-launch a clean VM every time an old VM shut down, and keep the CSV populated with fake account details.30 VMs were browsing 24x7 for ALlAdvantage. My roommate set up a caching proxy on his Linux box, so he didn&#x27;t hose the house&#x27;s T1 connection. 10% of the payout (the referral fees) over something like 4-5 months paid for the whole desktop. AllAdvantage never got returned cheques from the fake addresses because they never paid out. I think he ran his system for over a year before AllAdvantage went out of business, for a total of something like $12k in profit.He ran his own DNS server that hopped randomly all over the &#x2F;16 to reduce the probability of detection. He&#x27;s pretty convinced AllAdvantage&#x27;s fraud people noticed him as an extreme outlier. He suspects they ignored him because the data he was generating for them cost 1&#x2F;11th as much as most of the other data they were selling to customers.Edit: a quick search shows the AllAdvantage rate was maybe $0.40&#x2F;hr. 10% of this was $0.04 x 30 VMs = $1.20&#x2F;hr 24x7. 8766 hours&#x2F;year works out to about $10,000 per year. $12k in profit, $4k in RAM, and $1k for the rest of the machine works out to a bit under 2 years of running the system, if the rest of my memory is roughly accurate.A few years later, our school kept the &#x2F;16 allocated to us, but only routed the first &#x2F;24 to the house. I&#x27;m sure my roommate wasn&#x27;t the only one to get up to shenanigans with so many IP addresses.Edit: He also found some online casinos that didn&#x27;t explicitly forbid bots and he set up some poker bots that would keep track of its winning percentages against all other players. He set up some monitoring&#x2F;control software for his feature phone (or was it a PDA?) so he could watch his losses from class and shut it down if necessary.He kept records of every card seen in every game his bots played. I asked on at least 3 occasions for access to that data, to check for (1) naive shuffling (2) using a linear congruential generator instead of cryptographic quality random numbers and (3) seeding with time instead of a true random seed. He told me at least 3 times that he would give me FTP access to card histories, but never did. A couple years later, a paper came out detailing a code review of the most common online poker software finding (1) naive shuffling (2) using a linear congruential generator (3) seeded using only the time the game started and (4) containing an off-by-one error in the naive shuffle. The off-by-one error might have prevented me from figuring it all out from the poker bot histories, but there&#x27;s some alternate history where we made millions in online poker, fully within the published rules of the sites. (Unfortunately, the millions would have come entirely from other players, the online casinos not bearing any of the costs of the shoddy coding.)He mused several times that it would be fun to create a cardboard box with one of those see-through windows for a shipping label... and two subtle slits allowing a continuous roll of various shipping addresses and an advancement mechanism to be hidden within the package. He&#x27;d use a battery and&#x2F;or inertial energy harvesting weight to power a device to change the sipping address every 4 hours. He wanted to send such a package with tracking information and watch it ping-pong around the country until someone realized something was fishy with the package.He eventually dropped out of school and was living off of his poker bots until (without health insurance) his appendix burst and he was forced to get a day job to pay off his medical debt.I hope he gets elected to Congress someday (though he&#x27;s not very political) just to make a great epilogue to a biographical film. reply KMag 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s too late to edit, but I swear I know the difference between ad and add.On a side note, I thought a naive shuffle with a well-seeded cryptographic-quality pseudorandom number generator was the most likely finding from his poker bot history archive. I thought the linear congruential generator and seeding with the current time were long shots. I was just hoping that the skewed distribution gave a measurable edge over bots and players that were playing under the assumption of a uniform distribution of cards.Had I thought there was a reasonable probability of a popular poker site using a LCRNG seeded with the current time, I would have been much more persistent in my requests for the history data. reply dang 11 hours agorootparentnext [1 more] (I fixed those two typos for you) reply IG_Semmelweiss 8 hours agorootparentprevYou had me at alladvantageThat and netzero.

I doubt there was a form you could fill out and authorize a transfer to a random individual by merely having an e-mail address and a domain name.Even if you could finagle a transfer by impersonating the company via e-mail, that would be a clear case of fraud and theft from the defunct company&#x27;s assets. You couldn&#x27;t actually expect to use or sell the block without anyone noticing.> He ended up trading it under the table to a company that could use it, in exchange for the promise of free service for life.If the story is true, what likely happened is that they coordinated the actual sale through proper channels and laughed at your friends&#x27; fraud, er, antics, choosing to give him a token gesture instead of actually buying anything from him. reply wmf 17 hours agoparentprevThe ham radio &#x2F;8 was also \"stolen\" and resold, although for a good cause. reply Olipro 16 hours agoparentprevNobody&#x27;s going to run a &#x2F;8 on a single LAN segment.If you want maximum efficiency, your hosts all have RFC1918 IPs and you route the public IP addresses to them. zero wastage, everything usable. reply icedchai 14 hours agorootparentWhen I went to college in the mid 90&#x27;s, the entire campus was on a &#x2F;16, flat network, every machine had a 255.255.0.0 netmask.

But in this case we&#x27;re just clearly receiving the message he&#x27;s trying to communicate with intentionality reply roughly 15 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a difference between physical characteristics and fashion. You should not judge someone by their physical characteristics - by and large that&#x27;s out of their control. Their fashion, on the other hand, is how they&#x27;ve decided to present themselves, and is absolutely fair game for judgement, especially for things like corporate headshots in which one is very intentionally choosing how they would like to be viewed by the world.This fellow decided to present himself as something like a cross between a pickup artist and a street magician, which seems like it was pretty on the money. reply wongarsu 15 hours agoparentprevI suspect it&#x27;s less his physical characteristics, or even his clothing and jewelry, but almost exclusively his body language that is producing this reaction. reply Alupis 15 hours agorootparentNo, it&#x27;s definitely the accoutrements he decides to wrap himself in.Normal people don&#x27;t dress or look like that.

    "originBody": "Psytrance Guide Welcome to the very first, complete, up-to-date Psytrance styles guide. It's a great place to discover new subgenre you haven't heard before and to use it as a reference for organising your DJ collection tags. Support the author on Patreon New: each subgenre now has a Spotify playlist! Just click the subgenre title you are interested in or browse them all here. Tweet Share4 Send Plus Pin2 Psychedelic Also known as: Uptempo Psy, UK Psy, Classic BPM range: 145 — 148 Psychedelic is probably the most iconic subgenre of Psytrance music, with driving basslines and futuristic sounds often created using FM synthesis. Pioneered by the London-based labels like Alchemy, Flying Rhino and TIP Records, among the others, this subgenre has also become known as the UK Psy. Tristan & Aardvarkk — Daws Of Perception (Imagine Mars & Volcano Remix) Mad Tribe — Tuned In Perfectly (Original Mix) Djantrix & Spirit Architect — Experimental Virus (Original Mix) Dust & Lunatica — Hippie Shaker (Original Mix) Notable artists Ajja, Avalon, Burn In Noise, Electric Universe, Laughing Buddha, Mad Tribe, Tristan Notable labels Alchemy Records, BMSS Records, Bom Shanka Music, Digital Om Productions, Grasshopper Records, Looney Moon Records, Nano Records, TIP Records Psytrance Also known as: Psy-Trance, Classy, 140-BPM-Psy BPM range: 138 — 142 This subgenre organically fits between Progressive Psy and the classic Psychedelic in the BPM range, combining the best elements of these two. It is arguably the most common Psytrance subgenre now that sounds on the festivals all over the world, and in fact, if you hear the word “Psytrance”, it’s most likely referred to this particular subgenre. Note: read why author prefers to call these tracks Psytrance and not Progressive Psy in the blog. Daniel Lesden — Structured Chaos (Original Mix) Nertum — Metaphysics Energy (Original Mix) Outsiders & Sonic Species — Who We Are (Original Mix) Vertical Mode — Time Machine (Original Mix) Notable artists Artificials, E-Clip, Lifeforms, Outsiders, Relativ, Sonic Species, StarLab, Vertical Mode Notable labels Digital Om Productions, HOMmega Productions, Profound Records, Sacred Technology, TechSafari Records, Transcape Records Progressive Psy Also known as: Psy-Prog, Progressive BPM range: 134 — 138 Emerging in the mid 00’s in Europe, Progressive Psy has quickly expanded to become one of the most common Psytrance subgenres. And it’s very diverse too, featuring a quite wide range of vibes. Progressive Psy doesn’t utilise one particular type of sound, but rather focuses on the groove, the flow, and how it progresses over time. Vibrasphere — Morning Breeze (Original Mix) Protonica — Floating Point (Original Mix) Phaxe — Disturbed (Original Mix) Mindwave — 24 Hours (Original Mix) Notable artists Ace Ventura, Atacama, Human Blue, Liquid Soul, Mindwave, Protonica, Vibrasphere, Zyce Notable labels Digital Nature Records, Iono Music, TesseracTstudio, Sourcecode Transmissions, Yellow Sunshine Explosion Minimal Psy Also known as: Minimal, Deep Psychedelic, Zenonesque BPM range: 130 — 135 Although this subgenre might be formally called Progressive, it’s typically slower, deeper and less melodic than the Progressive Psy we know today. Tracks of this subgenre build-up slowly, allowing artists to focus more on things like reverb tails, delay effects, little percussion tricks, and other subtle details. Note: probably, Dark Progressive aka Zenonesque and Psygressive will be separated in the future version of this guide. Please read more in the blog. Beat Bizarre — Blown To Smithereens (Original Mix) Son Kite — Eye See You (Original Mix) Subliminal Codes — In the Now (Original Mix) Dreamstalker — 25 Changes (Original Mix) Notable artists Atmos, Beat Bizarre, Krumelur, Perfect Stranger, Son Kite, Sensient Notable labels Echoes Records, Plusquam Records, Uxmal Records, Zenon Records Tribal Also known as: Triplets, Ethnic Psy BPM range: 136 — 140 Pioneered by Juno Reactor and then recently popularised by Vini Vici, Tribal Psy utilises triplets bassline pattern along with some ethnic drums and vocal samples. Some producers overused triplets so much in the recent years, so at some point, having a triplet drop is almost considered as a cliché. Juno Reactor — Conga Fury (Ace Ventura Remix) Vini Vici — The Tribe (Original Mix) Space Hypnose — King Of Elephants (Original Mix) Omiki & Planet 6 — Troya (Original Mix) Notable artists Berg, Juno Reactor, Loud, Omiki, Pop Art, Planet 6, Pura Vida, Vini Vici Notable labels Blue Tunes Records, Bounce Recordings, Mainstage Records, X7M Records Offbeat Also known as: The Offbeat, Progressive Trance, Hamburg Psy BPM range: 134 — 140 The Offbeat Psy uses a specific bassline pattern at which a single bass note hits between four-on-the-floor kick drums, hence the name. It is originated from Hamburg, Germany, in the late 00’s. Tracks in this subgenre often include sampled speech samples processed with the gate or sidechain effects. Vaishiyas — Axon & John (Original Mix) Interactive Noise — Temptation (Original Mix) Symphonix — Hit And Run (Ticon Remix) Dj Fabio & Moon — Emotionally Unplugged (Original Mix) Notable artists Audiomatic, Fabio & Moon, Interactive Noise, Neelix, Unseen Dimensions, Vaishiyas Notable labels 432 Records, Audioload Music, Spin Twist Records Psy-Techno Also known as: Psychedelic Techno, Psy-Tech BPM range: 125 — 136 As the title suggests, this subgenre is a blend of Psytrance and Techno that combines various elements from these two. And since both Psytrance and Techno can vary in tempo and vibe, there are pretty much no boundaries to this subgenre too: it can go from deep and minimal to hard and rough. Luis M — Embrace The Fear (Original Mix) Trilingo — Get Something (Tim Taste Remix) Breger — Zero Demands (Grub Remix) Allaby — Scoop (Original Mix) Notable artists Cybered, Freedom Fighters, Hedustma, Ectima, Trilingo, LampГ© , Tim Taste, Luis M Notable labels IbogaTech, Subios Records, Alula Tunes, Alpaka Muzik, Techgnosis Records Psy Tech-Trance Also known as: Uplifting Psy BPM range: 138 — 140 Psy Tech-Trance is a product of a clash between Psytrance and a regular Trance worlds. Tracks in this subgenre typically have the Psy bassline, longer uplifting breakdowns, and acidic riffs at the climax. Although some devoted psytrance fans don’t accept this subgenre as a part of the Psy scene and culture, it grows pretty rapidly, especially in the US. Simon Patterson — Smack (Waio Remix) Christopher Lawrence & No Comment — Horizon (Original Mix) Sean Tyas — Matter Of Time (Original Mix) Sam Jones — Charlie Charlie (Original Mix) Notable artists Christopher Lawrence, Harmonic Rush, Jordan Suckley, Sean Tyas, Simon Patterson Notable labels Damaged Records, Mental Asylum Records, Perfecto Fluoro, Pharmacy Music, The VII Crew Psybreaks Also known as: Psychedelic Breaks, Psy Tech-Funk, Broken Beats BPM range: 130 — 138 Psybreaks is a relatively new subgenre that emerged in the last 00’s. It combines heavy Psytrance bassline and squelch sounds with a Breaks rhythm, classic Electro snares, and sometimes even Industrial scrapes. Hedflux & Grouch — Lumination (Original Mix) Beatman and Ludmilla — Moldova (Original Mix) MartOpetEr — Brain Hacker (Original Mix) Marv-In-Blue — Phaze 3 (Original Mix) Notable artists Bad Tango, Beatman and Ludmila, Blazer, Broken Eye, Headflux, MartOpetEr Notable labels Broken Robot Recordings, Luminus Music, Neom Recordings, VIM Records Mainstream Also known as: Commercial Psy, Pop Psy BPM range: 130 — 138 This isn’t quite a subgenre, but rather consequences of when Psytrance artists go mainstream: it often includes vocals and cheesy melodies to appeal to a broader audience. Although these tracks are typically labelled in stores as “Psytrance”, let’s be clear about it: it’s not Psytrance, really. Neelix — People (Dragon Edit) Carnage & Timmy Trumpet — PSY or DIE (Extended Mix) Morten Granau & Phaxe — Lost (Original Mix) Day.Din — Breaking Dread (Original Mix) Notable artists Coming Soon, Day.Din, Ranji, Morten Granau, Yahel Notable labels Armada, Spin Twist Records, Spinnin' Records, Who's Afraid of 138 Goa Trance Also known as: Goa, 604 Psy BPM range: 135 — 150 Goa Trance is the ancestor of all Psytrance music as a whole we know today. Formed in the 80’s in Goa, India, by the modern hippies of that time, Goa Trance got its global recognition in the mid 90’s. Goa Trance is considered as “organic”, that is to say, it does not have the typical “metallic” sounds of electronic music and often presents an oriental aesthetics in its melodies, mostly with Indian consonance, as well as various tribal elements from the Indian culture such as references to the Buddhist or Hinduist mythology and mysticism. Although Goa Trance is considered as an oldschool genre now, some artists and labels are still releasing it, referring to it as a New School or Neogoa. Oforia — Oasis (Original Mix) Artifact303 — Feelings (Original Mix) Radical Distortion — Psychedelic Dreams (Original Mix) Filteria — Ultimator! (Original Mix) Notable artists Asia 2001, Astral Projection, Artifact303, Filteria, Hallucinogen, Man With No Name, Miranda, Ovnimoon, Toi Doi, Transwave Notable labels Flying Rhino Records, MDMA Records, Suntrip Records, Timewarp, Twisted Records Nitzhonot Also known as: Uplifting Goa, Morning Goa Trance BPM range: 145 — 160 Nitzhonot is a subgenre that formed from the classic Goa Trance in the mid 90’s in Israel, and it literally means “victories” in Hebrew. It is typically faster than Goa Trance, with high-pitched kick drums and fast-paced oriental melodies. And just like Goa Trance, Nitzhonot considered an underground subgenre among Psytrance as a whole, which is an underground style itself. Goalien — Psychedelic Dilemma (Original Mix) Nova Fractal — Perception (Original Mix) Agneton — Eden Ahead (Original Mix) Cyan — A New Galaxy (Original Mix) Notable artists Agneton, Cyan, Eyal Barkan, Goalien, Shivax Notable labels Ezel-Ebed Records, Krembo Records, Phototropic Records, Sita Records Full-on Also known as: Morning Fullon, Israeli Full-on BPM range: 140 — 148 Full-on is a dynamic, playful, and musical subgenre of Psytrance that appeals to a broader audience because of its positive vibe. Unlike of a typical straight Psytrance bassline pattern, the Full-on basssline plays on various notes across few octaves, creating a special rhythm and melody that way. The period of 2004–2009 is considered as the “golden age” of Full-on, before Progressive Psy took over the global Psy scene. DigiCult — Cosmic Company (Original Mix) Electro Sun & System Nipel — We Can Dance (Original Mix) Alternative Control — HAARP (Original Mix) Sundose — In The Music (Original Mix) Notable artists Astrix, Bizzare Contact, Electro Sun, Ephedrix, DigiCult, System Nipel, Sesto Sento, Wizzy Noise Notable labels Agitato Records, Dacru Records, Mainstage Records, United Beats Records, Utopia Records Night Full-on Also known as: Twilight, South African Full-on BPM range: 145 — 150 Night Full-on is the evil twin of Full-on: it has the same fast-paced bass and leads but with a darker vibe and twisted, synthetic sounds. On the festivals, Twilight Psy typically sound during the night-time, hence the name. Note: probably, Night Full-on and Twilight will be separated in the future version of this guide. Please read more in the blog. CPU — Processing Unit (Original Mix) Azax Syndrom — Flawless Victory (Original Mix) Alienn — Goodfellas (Original Mix) Absolum & Outer Signal — Get Up Now (Original Mix) Notable artists Absolum, Brainwash, CPU, Ex-Gen, Outer Signal, Scorb, Pitch Hikers, Shift, Stereopanic Notable labels 3D Vision, Hypergate Records, Lysergic Records, Nexus Media, Nutek Records, Mechanik Records Dark Psy Also known as: Cyberdelic, Alien Psy BPM range: 140 — 155 Dark Psy name speaks for itself. This subgenre is dark, cold, and themed with a horror special effects. Sometimes it’s called Cyberdelic, which stands for “cybernetic + psychedelic”, due to a massive amount of artificial sounds, lasers, and other alien sounds. Many Dark Psy producers are hailing from Russia, so you might see this genre referred as a Russian style. Sychotria & Fungoloyds - Alien Fashion (Original Mix) Fungus Funk - Duck The Mechwarrior (Original Mix) Blisargon & Demogorgon - Space Invaders (Original Mix) Arjuna & Atriohm - The Drunken Orchestra (Original Mix) Notable artists Fungus Funk, Goa Gil, Kindzadza, Ocelot, Penta, Savage Scream, Zik Matutero Notable labels Bhooteshwara Records, DejaVu Records, Discovalley Records, Parvati Records, Vertigo Records, Zaikadelic Records Forest Psy Also known as: Forest Psychedelic, Scandinavian Dark Psy BPM range: 150 — 160 Forest Psy is very similar to Dark Psy in many ways, but it’s less robotic-themed and focuses more on the ambient noises, nature atmosphere, and the spooky sounds you would hear in a dark psychedelic forest. Filled with swarming and teeming effects, it is also slightly faster than Dark Psy and arranged in a straightforward manner, almost with no breakdowns and beat interruptions. Helan & Halvan - Gnomen (Original Mix) Skydda Skogen - Oneiro (Original Mix) Maniac Bubbles - Maniacs On The Run (Original Mix) Distorted Goblin - Reborn (Original Mix) Notable artists Atriohm, Baba Yaga, Deep Brian From Bosis, Distorted Goblin, Taigan Sunsen Notable labels Digital Shiva Power, Parvati Records, Sonic Chakras Records, Yggdrasil Records Hi-Tech Also known as: Hitek Psy, Psycore BPM range: 170 — 230 Hi-Tech is a Psytrance style strongly influenced by Dark Psytrance, Psycore, and Full-On. It is characterized by a synthetic aesthetic pushed to the extreme. In terms of tempo, Hi-Tech vary from 150 BPM to over 200 BPM, making it and Psycore the fastest Psychedelic Trance styles. Unlike Psycore, Hi-Tech can present an absence of atmosphere in favor of a non-regular melodic structure. In addition, Hi-Tech is generally the least predictable and constant of all Psychedelic Trance styles. Note: in the future version of this guide, Hi-Tech and Psycore will be separated. Please read more in the blog. Gorump Peyya - You Can Go All To Hell (Original Mix) Crazy Astronaut & OxiDaksi — Psy Fi (2015) Spákum Hupákum — Wings Of Stones (Original Mix) Extraterrestrial — Space Lab Drops (Original Mix) Notable artists Crazy Astronaut, Junx Punx, Gorump Peyya, Psykovsky, Torog, Yaminahua Notable labels 2to6 Records, Alice-D Records, Popol Vuh Records, Osom Music Suomi Also known as: Suomisaundi, Finnish Psy BPM range: 135 — 145 Originated from Finland, Suomi is probably the most free-form subgenre of Psychedelic music allowing artists to go wild and experiment both musically and production-wise. Suomisaundi tracks are usually very melodic, including heavy influences from early Goa, tribal beats and Acid Trance tracks, as well as funky guitar and keyboard loops and sounds from or reminiscent of 80’s. Puoskari — Far From Home (Original Mix) Aavepyörä — Unessaelämä (Original Mix) Salakavala — Pigfoot (Original Mix) James Reipas — Käpälämäki (Original Mix) Notable artists Aavepyörä, James Reipas, Puoskari, Salakavala, Texas Faggott, Troll Scientists Notable labels Exogenic Records, Random Records, Sonic Dragon, Ultiva Records Psychill Also known as: Psybient, Psychedelic Chillout, Downtempo Psy BPM range: 90 — 120 Psychill is a downtempo genre that often seeks to reach a state of deep relaxation, close to meditation and lucid dreaming. It utilises various elements of Goa Trance and Psychedelic music in general, and typically has a classic Goa kick drum, 303’s sounds, and lush atmospheric pads. Astronaut Ape — High Above The Clouds (Original Mix) Flucturion 2.0 — Pro Temporo (Original Mix) Man With No Name — Azymuth (Original Mix) Gyrro — From Metariel (Original Mix) Notable artists Alwoods, Asura, Astronaut Ape, Cloower Wooma, E-Mantra, Lemonchill, Tarac, Twin Shape Notable labels Altar Records, Desert Trax, Microcosmos Records, Mindspring Music, Ultimae Records Chillout Also known as: Chill, Ambient, Downtempo BPM range: 80 — 110 Chillout music is very similar to Psychill but less psychedelic influenced. Formally speaking, Chillout is a subgenre of electronic music in general, not Psytrance in particular. However, historically it has a deep connection to the Psy scene and today you can hear many Chillout artists playing at the Psytrance festivals. Vibrasphere — Breathing Place (Original Mix) Suduaya — Cellular Memory (Original Mix) Carbon Based Lifeforms — Set Theory (Original Mix) Sysyphe — Magic Wedding (Original Mix) Notable artists Carbon Based Lifeforms, Kyoto, Side Liner, Suduaya, Sysyphe, Vibrasphere Notable labels Altar Records, Cosmicleaf Records, Hadra Records, Microcosmos Records, Ultimae Records About the author Daniel Lesden is an underground DJ, music producer, A&R manager, radio host based in Moscow.

It&#x27;s a very simple sound that you can make in any subtractive synth - you start with a single saw, add a lowpass filter, and instead of using the amplitude envelope to control the dynamics or \"pluck\" of the sound you modulate the cutoff of the filter by an envelope with a very short attack, quick decay, and low or zero sustain.If you&#x27;re fancy you can use a stepper or lfo sync&#x27;d to 16th notes to do the same thing instead of programming loops of 16th notes.And of course, you sidechain compress that with the kick to get the pumping sound.That&#x27;s how you get the deep vibe of a psy track that resonates in the club at 2am.That&#x27;s just the basics. The really good tracks find ways to make it crazy, like modulating the decay of the filter envelope with velocity of the notes and then adding velocity curves to create dynamics with the baseline, or adding a reverb send and automating the send level as you build up to the end of a phrase. Or taking the basic idea (a plucky bass with sixteenth notes) and changing how the pluck is defined via an FM synth, or overdrive, or frequency shift, and so on. It&#x27;s such a simple sound that can be driven to weird places. reply stavros 2 hours agoparentAh yes, of course. reply commotionfever 1 hour agoparentprevregarding the pumping, I&#x27;m not sure if sidechain compression is what most producers are doing. I&#x27;d describe it as a gallop rather than a bump.so with 16ths, you&#x27;d typically see 1&#x2F;16 & 2&#x2F;16 have zero to little amplitude, 3&#x2F;16 & 4&#x2F;16 have most of the energy. 4 maybe even a little less so.which can&#x27;t be done by sidechaining. also phase alignment with the kick is important reply freeqaz 1 hour agorootparentAre there any resources out there that you would recommend to learn about this stuff? reply timc3 32 minutes agorootparentBasic song writing is a good place to start (and should cover the dynamics&#x2F;loudness of notes and sounds as per the parent post to introduce groove). Then combine with sound engineering.There is a lot of resources all over the web, and tutors and courses that you can do.If you want to start off with an easy introduction then maybe Oscar @ Underdog can help: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MAJz4-YZdio&t=8sIf you want to product Psytrance - then you are lucky because IMHO it&#x27;s perhaps the easiest most formulaic genre. reply globular-toast 58 minutes agoparentprevAlso perhaps not explicitly stated but in these genres the bass line is a drone. There&#x27;s no melody in the bass line. This is similar to instruments like the sitar. It creates add harmonics and basically gives it the psychedelic sound. reply drsnow 1 hour agoparentprevBro what the fuck does literally any of that shit mean lol reply SSLy 42 minutes agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;learningsynths.ableton.com&#x2F; reply 0xEF 33 minutes agorootparentThis is a cool resource, Ableton being quite respected and all, but I&#x27;m interested in making synths with analog electronics if you have any suggestions in that area.

My first listening experience I basically denounced it as \"too hard\" and noisy but my general love for electronic music made me keep listening and all of a sudden I was hooked. I listened to and played mostly goa-trance due to its very melodic nature, it really has something unique with its focus on melody (with non-western scales) and not just squeeky and strange sounds (which I do like). The explosion of \"Full-on\" in the mid 00s made me loose interest and it dominated the parties I went to and played at. Full on has this particular annoying feature of being, yes full on, hardly any buildups just cheap, cheesy breaks and \"in your face\" to please the fistbumping crowd. I still occasionally listen when there is an interesting release but this is mainly a fading memory from my youth..This is in general a great guide, very impressive! I mean it even includes Suomisaundi (one of my favourites) which is such a small subsub-genre, back in the days it encompassed maybe a handful of artists on 1-2 record labels. The sometimes narrow BPM ranges I&#x27;d say you can ignore. The genre is very experimental so you can have pretty much any of the faster sub-genres speed down and then just call it \"* chill\". This was often the case when albums were made in the 00s, that an artist would end with a chill track, many times these were their best outputs and sometimes lead to new side projects.I don&#x27;t want to pick on the song selection but there is at least one major artist missing here.

Specifically the relation between the harmonic structure of the saw and square wave and the properties of a resonant filter that can pick these harmonics out in various ways.

While you could reasonably say that about any electronic genre, Psytrance really ups the level of having any given median track sounding indistinguishable. Yeah, the sound design experimentations are cool; yeah, it&#x27;s a good sound... but I wish I would actually remember it for _something_ specific it does well.In general, I think I miss the songwriting aspect most.

There is so much more to music than the tempo, it has always felt overly reductive to me. I had a friend who was a psytrance producer and even hearing him talk at length about it, I was never convinced that BPM was a critical differentiator. Also respectfully I think categorizing a subgenre as falling within 4 BPM is outrageously too narrow. Many casual listeners cannot even detect such a small change in tempo. reply rogerclark 7 hours agoparentCasual listeners can&#x27;t detect it, but it strongly affects the possibility space for production purposes. For instance, if you&#x27;re writing happy hardcore music at 170+ BPM with a kick drum on every beat, you will get surprisingly little time between those kicks to work with the bass and other instruments. While this is a somewhat extreme example, even something like the difference between 128 BPM and 138 BPM can change what you&#x27;re making. A commercial house track produced at 128 BPM may sound like 90s Eurodance when played at 138. Similarly, a deep house track produced at 122 might feel like radio EDM when played at 128.While you could certainly make psytrance at 150 BPM, it&#x27;s going to pack a different punch. You&#x27;ll make different decisions about what works and what doesn&#x27;t, and then it&#x27;s going to end up sounding even more different from the rest of the 138 PBM psytrance -- oops, you&#x27;ve shifted genres. Slow it down to 110 and then people aren&#x27;t dancing to the track quite the same way anymore. Try dancing to the same song at 100 BPM and then at 120 BPM... you&#x27;ll notice the difference immediately. Tempo isn&#x27;t everything, but it&#x27;s much more than just a number. reply jjulius 6 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re interested in some BPM fuckery, there&#x27;s a small-ish contingent of artists&#x2F;labels doing some cool things around the 80&#x2F;160-ish BPM range. Folk like Donato Dozzy, Patrick Russell and Forest Drive West have been putting together some great sets that sound like this militant-ish blend of Techno and Drum and Bass and just get really &#x27;out there&#x27; in, in my opinion, the best way possible.There&#x27;s one moment in a Forest Drive West set (I wish I could remember which one) where he plays the first 45-ish minutes at 160-ish, and then drops down to 125-130 for the last 1hr+ - but he does it in a manner that you never hear DJs do and almost doesn&#x27;t work. He leaves the ~160BPM track playing, and brings in the 125-ish track over it in a way that creates this really cool syncopated rhythm. It&#x27;s risky, and there&#x27;s a reason you usually don&#x27;t see people do it, but he pulls it off. I have a particular fondness for Jazz music, particularly Jazz musicians who fuck with time in a similar manner, so to hear a DJ pulling off something like that is awesome to me.But yeah, highly recommend checking out Dozzy&#x27;s surprise closing set at Terraforma[1] and Patrick Russell&#x27;s Mostra[2] set.Edit: The FDW set I&#x27;m thinking of is his set from Boom Festival[3].[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;donato-dozzy&#x2F;donato-dozzy-terraforma-...[2]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;monument-podcast&#x2F;mnmt-recordings-patr...[3]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;boomfestival&#x2F;forestdrivewest-the-gard... reply tomduncalf 3 hours agorootparentAh what a pleasure to see Donato Dozzy mentioned on here!

In general is there any Psytrance where tempo evolves during the song, goes up and down? I understand it might be difficult to dance to. reply jjulius 6 hours agorootparentIn Psytrance, and dance music in general, most BPMs will stay the same throughout the track. You may have moments where the track will cut to half-time and \"feel\" slower, even though it&#x27;s kinda not, but more often than not you&#x27;re going to find that dance music tracks maintain the same BPM throughout.DJs, however, will often be the ones switching the tempo up during a set, either slowly adjusting it up and down over the course of the night, or switching things up and suddenly bringing in a track at a completely different BPM. reply SturgeonsLaw 6 hours agorootparentprevChillgressive is a great search term to find some slow psychedelic beats reply matt_j 5 hours agoparentprevI play psy-trance at a range of tempos, from dub stuff at 70-80bpm, through prog stuff around 110-130bpm, to more high energy stuff up at 140-150bpm.The main reason for sticking to a tempo is because psy-trance, and (good) trance music in general is about the constant pulse. The goal is to put the listener in &#x27;the zone&#x27; (a trance even :P), and then give them a bunch of ear candy in the mids and highs to keep their happy little brains occupied.So for any given set DJs generally pick a tempo and stick to it and deliver a driving, consistent pulse, and everything else is just colouring in on top. reply hutzlibu 7 hours agoparentprev\"Many casual listeners cannot even detect such a small change in tempo.\"Maybe not consciously, but their heart can probably (literaly) feel it and react differently, which is what this is mostly about. And in general I totally agree, that there is way more to music than tempo and I am only partially into anything techno as I like more instruments and variations, but with electronic dance music the rhythm simply matters the most for dancing. reply kortex 6 hours agoparentprev> Many casual listeners cannot even detect such a small change in tempo.I DJ both electronic formats as well as \"general pop hits\" nights. People may not consciously tell, but you take a well know track, and speed it up 3-5% (which also increases the pitch, unless you enable pitch-time stretch correction), and it injects a noticeable amount of energy into the dancefloor.It&#x27;s also just a social&#x2F;\"conformal\" thing. Tempo regions serve as a kind of Schelling point for styles and energy levels. So if you have a given sub-style or vibe, you are likely to produce music in that style and speed, so it can readily mix in the same context.Again, all of these micro-genres listed still fall under the aegis of \"psytrance\" and djs can and often do mix across boundaries and pitch stuff up&#x2F;down as a part of their art. It&#x27;s really about self-association and capturing specific vibes, vs exclusion or genre-policing. reply anigbrowl 5 hours agoparentprevMany casual listenersSince the target audience is &#x27;people who dance to the same music from ~midnight to sunrise&#x27;, the ability to sustain a steady pace over that period matters the same way it would for a marathon runner or similar. I haven&#x27;t gone racing in a while but goa parties used to have a pretty consistent cycle of warmup for an hour, take off over an hour, full-on for 4-6 urs depending on the time of year, then the sun comes up and it would switch to &#x27;sloa&#x27;, basically the same musical flavor but coasting down to a walking pace. reply bangkoksbest 7 hours agoparentprevBecause it&#x27;s how DJs connect tracks together.

Most genres have a much wider range, eg ~10-ish or more BPMs. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to limit these genres to such a small range, when a genre is more about the specific sound and style of a track.Source: DJ for ~25 years. reply bangkoksbest 47 minutes agorootparentYeah, I&#x27;m not saying all the genres operate the same with BPMs. Compared to most house and techno events I go to, I do feel that psytrance events are a bit more \"unrelenting\" in bpm where I wish there was more variety. reply lynx23 19 minutes agoparentprevIt is not about the listeners, but about the DJs. The less BPM difference, the easier it is to mix a set. reply wahnfrieden 6 hours agoparentprevBecause DJs don’t want to change the tempo of what they play by too much until it sounds wrong, and most electronic music is produced to be played at clubsAnd because the dance styles that match ranges of bpm are so different, audiences find ranges they prefer. Try dancing to 125bpm old berghain tracks and compare with how you’re able to move your body in sync with 155bpm hard groove. It’s a completely different experience. This is dance music. reply jjulius 6 hours agorootparentSome of my favorite dancefloor moments have been hearing a track I love played at a wildly different BPM than I&#x27;m used to hearing (whether it&#x27;s playing a 33 as a 45&#x2F;vice versa, or using a CDJ to really stretch the tempo). The way the vibe of a track can change completely, and shift your perspective of a piece of music, is always super cool to me.I caught Rhadoo a few years back and he spent two hours playing this dark, kinda spacey techno that just chugged along real nicely at around 125BPM. I didn&#x27;t love the tracks, but thought the way that he was blending everything was interesting - I&#x27;d recommend seeing him play if you can solely for the master class in mixing that he&#x27;ll give ya.At any rate, a little over two hours in, I started to hear a familiar hi-hat. My body knew the track, but I couldn&#x27;t place it. Then he started fucking with the low-end EQs and you could hear it - Happy Cycling by Boards of Canada (the original, not a remix or an edit or anything), a 100BPM downtempo-ish track, coming into the middle of this dark, chugging techno set at 125BPM. Literally my favorite BoC track and the last thing I&#x27;d ever expect to hear in the middle of such a set. It was like he&#x27;d built the whole set up to that moment, and it worked so fucking well.

My problem is that I just can&#x27;t find similar music. People will say: \"Oh I like psy too\" and then recommend various artists of which the music sounds very repetitive to me (it&#x27;s not just 5 minutes of dunalun)One of the things I feel sets them apart (at least in for example in their best works) is that they&#x27;re very complex tracks that feel like you&#x27;re going on a journey where they start with a theme and then revisit it later in the track.I was excited to see this site cause I&#x27;d maybe finally understand what subgenre I need to search in specifically but they weren&#x27;t mentioned even once which is strange since they&#x27;re the most successful psy artist of all time.So what sub genre do they fit into and what else can I listen to? reply xabush 1 hour agoparentIM are legendary!

Maybe not too thin, ok, but still. Simple example: last weekend some local bands were playing and we were talking about whether or not to go. So instead of looking them up on the internet (if they were even to be found already), I could just ask the organizer to give me a general idea of the style. If they say &#x27;one is goregrind, the other melodic death metal and the last one fairly standard grindcore&#x27; then we know pretty much what to expect. Same with psytrance: I really like when flyers simply state which of the various genres it roughly is. Like, if it&#x27;s labelled as old-school goa trance then it&#x27;s almost a gurantee for me I&#x27;ll be able to completely lose my mind there, as opposed to hi-tech which I find interesting but isn&#x27;t hours-long party material for me. reply unixhero 4 hours agoprevDimension 5, read the reviews, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discogs.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;145286-Dimension-5-Transdime...eg:Wotzenknecht 1 Dec 2009\"An old classic, fortunately repressed thanks to Suntrip Records.What defines a classic goa record ?1) Simplicity over complexityTake that, new-schoolers. Hear how simple the dreamy and uplifting \"Deep Space 5D\" is. Learn how to use space and time instead of adding huge layers of ultra-complex melodies one atop each other, then drowning everything into an ocean of reverb. Learn to know how the mind reacts to certain sound and patterns - learn buddhism.2) A universe in each trackTen tracks, ten unique moods. From cosmic mysticism to numbing bliss, notwithstanding the mind-fucking psychotropic experiences of both \"Omega Centaurus\" and the incredible \"Harmonic Convergence\". The melodies stay in memory for a long time, and for nothing in the world would I let them flow away.3) An ending (Ascent)No, this has nothing to do with Brian Eno. Or does it ? Learn that a downtempo track is not a pitched-down full-on stomper: again, it has to tell a story of its own. Remember how the best Transwave tracks always were their slowest one ? Speed is a measure, not a goal. \"Flow\" is beautiful, oneiric and chilling to the point of being terribly addictive.This may sound paradoxical, but classic records often define their own rules. A tip to remember. \"Transdimensional\" is unique although no other album could define more flawlessly what goa trance is about. Yes, they are other classics out there - but guess what ? They use their own rules as well. It&#x27;s no use trying to catch their spirit these days - they are already way beyond stars, between past and timeless hyperspace.\" reply hdbxhhsbs 24 minutes agoprevHsbdbjbxbdjnsksbsbhjxndbssjkbshxhbsbjxbdbjsnsnsjjxnsskibdhfhnjks shysjsnzkjzbdhufnbddiksbdbidbhfuhdbddubdhujsjsodbhybddbhdjjsbdjdhdbbudskosbbdywiibxbdhsusjbsysubdhdubdhdujbdbdufbdbsjoznbzhxvyj exhd dnkj subsbx xubbshisbdhd hzbbsjsjsnsbbsñuxbddbuwyysoowb xjzjs sn reply AYBABTME 3 hours agoprevSomething strange is how prevalent listening to trance music seems to be amongst people doing deep work or study.

If I asked you to give me a list of the best Trance DJs, all of them would be wrong. Because 1) You shouldn&#x27;t have a concept of \"best Trance DJs\" and 2) Unless you have a copy of Harthouse or Eye Q&#x27;s early catalogue on vinyl you probably don&#x27;t know any actual Trance DJs. You probably don&#x27;t know what Trance is either.So what, exactly, is Trance and where did it come from?As direct as I can put it: Trance was an offshoot of German EBM in the late 80s and early 90s and was probably coined in 1991 by Mark Reeder of MFS Records (although the word had been bandied about for several years before then). And we know this because he tells us as such in this 1993 documentary about the early Trance scene:That first literal needle drop is Secret Knowledge - Sugar Daddy -- a \"fine example of trance music\". Trance proper is a term that only applies to this short-lived style of music in Germany and the UK (and to a lesser extent the US) before it got ripped apart and pulled in different directions for different reasons, mangling its reputation beyond recognition. And that is all Trance should refer to and nothing else.The principle behind Trance was the unresolved, infinite track, with interweaving elements and layers and a ceaseless beat carrying it along like a metronome.Like a lot of early electronic music (and like all good electronic music), Trance borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of Minimalism and it disdained the usage of the dull verse-bridge-chorus format of pop songcraft. In the hands of a competent DJ Trance sounds like one long song, unceasing and unwavering, all night long. A single arpeggiating synth lead with phaser sweeps is all it really needs.That&#x27;s not to say that Trance does not have hooks or melodies, or even anthems of the next-day-washing-the-dishes-whistling-to-yourself variety, or that it should not have breakdowns. They&#x27;re just not supposed to dominate Trance to an insufferable extent.Trance is best when it lives up to its namesake: It entrances you. Anything else it tries to do (like make you cheer on the douche jockey or put your arms in the air) is fucking offensive.Unfortunately there is a common tendency among critics and historians to find a number of similar attributes in a specific media, group them into a genre, and then go back in time and retcon other things with those attributes as the same genre despite the fact that the people in those eras did not and would not have called it that.This happens a lot in things like books and movies (for instance: the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope coined in 2007 and then retconned to include Audrey Hepburn movies from 50 years ago) and it also happens in music.And in electronic music&#x27;s case it has happened most often with Trance.There are a lot of things in the past that have been called proto-Trance or indicated as having a great influence on Trance, from Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s galloping synths to the electric body buzz of Liaisons Dangereuses to the experimental minimalism of Pink Floyd - On The Run to even some Trance forerunners like Psychic TV or The KLF. But none of those are really Trance.There is also a tendency among music magazines and fans to continuously call something that someone made Trance because they previously made Trance even though it&#x27;s clearly evident that they have long since moved on from the sound and have no interest in returning to it, like Ferry Corsten&#x27;s Electrohouse dumbassery, or whatever stupid shit Armin is trying to do, or Tiesto&#x27;s pitiful attempts at trying to make Trouse happen. But none of those are really Trance either.This is also why you should stop following these dipshits like they&#x27;re rock stars. Listen to Trance because you like Trance, not because you hero worship Dutch superdorks.And then there are the watered down pop offshoots of Trance (including Eurotrance and Vocal Trance) that you often hear in clothing stores at the mall. None of that is Trance either. That&#x27;s not what this genre is. Ferry, Armin, and Tiesto are not here.Listen to what real Trance should sound like. Trance as a concept was so fragile it obviously could not and did not last. As with most things in electronic music, things go to shit when the Dutch get hold of it. The descendents of Trance -- Progressive Trance, Hard Dance, Psy Trance, Eurotrance -- all sold it down the river in their own unique way.When I think of pure Trance music, I really don&#x27;t think of anything past 1994. There are some exceptions but generally all Trance music has been commercial pop drivel since the late 90s. I blame Oakenfold.Ish. reply mateuspires 7 hours agoprevVery interesting guide. I liked the examples.The understanding of the author on each subgenre is surprisingly different from mine. reply empath-nirvana 7 hours agoparentSubgenres in dance music are _extremely_ fluid and change from year to year and even month to month. Some of them are basically just adjective + genre.The reason dance music has so many sub-genres has to do with how djs mix records. They want to mix songs _smoothly_ and to do that they need songs that sound substantially similar to other songs they want to play. So they find a song or two they like, then they go looking for songs with similar tempos, energy levels, instruments, etc, so they can mix them together. If enough people settle into a particular musical territory, that becomes a \"sub-genre\", at least for now.Even something sort of broad like \"techno\" evolves a lot over time. reply z500 8 hours agoprevHi tech psytrance is some of the most aggressively weird stuff I&#x27;ve ever heard.

At the end of Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs, we had just that: a fully functional collaborative pixel editor using state-based CRDTs. The drawback to state-based CRDTs is that you need to transmit the full state between peers to sync up. And our CRDT’s full state is pretty big! For a 100x100 image, it’s around 648kb. Yikes! I won’t bury the lede: we’re going to reduce that by almost 98% to around 14kb. For context, that’s around half as big as the uncompressed image without any CRDT metadata. While we’ll never beat PNG, we can still do pretty well. The benchmarks I’ll cite in this article are all based on this image I drew, which was encoded here using the same format we’ll create by the end of the post:1 I’m imagining this picture hanging in the Louvre soon after this post is published. This playground uses the same pixel editor we built in the last post. You can change the color and brush size by clicking on the buttons below the canvas. The table to the right shows the size of the data in kilobytes. Right now, it just shows the size of the uncompressed data and the final result in our mystery format. As we compress our data further, we’ll add rows to the table showing how each format stacks up against the others, and their relative sizes. Currently, our data looks something like this: { \"0,0\": [\"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796\", 3, [255, 255, 255]], \"1,0\": [\"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796\", 4, [255, 255, 255]], \"2,0\": [\"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796\", 2, null], \"0,1\": [\"4ae8bd76-e84c-4652-bcd8-a5e339c574f3\", 2, [108, 79, 255]], \"1,1\": [\"4ae8bd76-e84c-4652-bcd8-a5e339c574f3\", 3, [108, 79, 255]] } It’s just the JSON state of our LWW Map CRDT.2 Each key is a string of the pixel’s (x,y) coordinates, and each value is a LWW Register state: a tuple of a peer ID, a timestamp and an RGB value. If a pixel has been erased, its RGB value is null. The JSON is formatted for easier reading, but when we’re talking about how much space it takes up, we’ll pretend it’s minified by omitting whitespace. Here’s a blank canvas so you can see how quickly the size increases as you draw. Pay attention to the different formats as we go through the article: some will actually start out larger than our uncompressed data, but quickly become smaller as more pixels are drawn! Hex Codes The easiest change to make is storing colors as hex codes rather than RGB tuples. As a reminder, here’s the type of each color: type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number]; Each channel has between one and three digits, so our color values look something like this: [1, 234, 56] That’s ten characters: six for the numbers, two for the commas and two for the brackets. If each number had three digits, it would take up a whole 13 characters. Hex codes come in at eight characters, max. By using sixteen digits (A–F representing the numbers 10–15) instead of our usual ten, we can represent each channel with two characters instead of three. Plus, since we know that each channel is two characters long, we can omit the commas. There’s one more trick: if both characters in each channel are the same, we can omit one, which takes us down to five characters (including quotes). Here’s what the data looks like now: { \"0,0\": [\"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796\", 3, \"fff\"], \"1,0\": [\"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796\", 4, \"fff\"], \"2,0\": [\"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796\", 2, null], \"0,1\": [\"4ae8bd76-e84c-4652-bcd8-a5e339c574f3\", 2, \"6c4fff\"], \"1,1\": [\"4ae8bd76-e84c-4652-bcd8-a5e339c574f3\", 4, \"6c4fff\"] } All in all, using hex codes rather than RGB tuples gets us down from 648kb to 606kb — a 6% improvement. It’s a start, but we’ll need much bigger improvements than that if we’re going to get all the way down to 14kb. UUID Table The next things to look at are the UUIDs. They’re a whopping 38 characters each (including quotes) and they show up in every single pixel. We could — and should! — remove the hyphens, but that will only shave off four characters per pixel. We need something more substantial. Instead of keeping the UUIDs directly in each pixel, we’ll store them in a table. That way, they only appear once in the document. In their place, each pixel will store a table key that maps to the full UUID. When we need the full state back, we perform the same process in reverse, replacing each pixel’s table key with its corresponding UUID. Here’s what the data looks like now. The 0th element of each array in data represents an index in the uuids array: { \"uuids\": [\"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796\", \"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3\"], \"data\": { \"0,0\": [0, 3, \"fff\"], \"1,0\": [0, 4, \"fff\"], \"2,0\": [0, 2, null], \"0,1\": [1, 2, \"6c4fff\"], \"1,1\": [1, 3, \"6c4fff\"] } } Our UUID table uses an array rather than a map, which has implied keys: the index of the item in the array. Using numbers as keys also saves two characters every time we reference a UUID, since we don’t need quotation marks as we would with strings. This turns out to be a substantial savings, taking us down to 236kb — a 63% improvement! Palette Table We can use the exact same technique for the colors. Rather than storing each color directly in each pixel, we build a table of all the colors used and replace the hex codes in each pixel with table keys. The last element of each array in data now represents an index in the palette array: { \"uuids\": [\"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796\", \"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3\"], \"palette\": [\"fff\", \"6c4fff\"], \"data\": { \"0,0\": [0, 3, 0], \"1,0\": [0, 4, 0], \"2,0\": [0, 2, null], \"0,1\": [1, 2, 1], \"1,1\": [1, 3, 1] } } Using a table like this seems strictly better, but there are some pathological scenarios in which it actually wastes space. Consider the case in which each color only appears once: we’d have the same number of colors as we have pixels, plus the overhead of mapping each pixel to a color in the table. Our current strategy works for pixel art, which tends to have a limited palette — but if we were dealing with photographs, we might want to choose another way to compress the color data. In this case, the palette table slims us down to 187kb — 71% smaller than our uncompressed data. Run-Length Encoding The next big things are the pixel coordinates — the map keys of our data object. With x and y each between one and three digits, these can take up to ten characters each (including the quotes and colon). Remember how, when we were drawing to the screen, we mapped indices in the buffer to coordinates? We went down the array four bytes at a time, drawing to each pixel in the first row and wrapping around when we reached the end. Here we’ll do the same thing, but in reverse. We’ll make the data an array, setting the pixel at \"0,0\" as the first element, \"1,0\" as the second element, etc. This raises a new issue: how do we represent blank pixels, where no user has drawn yet? Before, they would just be missing from the map. But now we have to represent them — otherwise, every pixel after a blank space would be in the wrong place! We could just put some sort of “spacer” value like null in the array where blank pixels would be. That’d work, but it would also waste a lot of space. Instead, we’ll use something called run-length encoding. It’s a very simple compression algorithm: when the same item appears consecutively in a sequence, instead of storing each item, store one of the item and the number of repeated instances. Let’s take this weird sentence as an example: James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher. There’s a lot of repetition there. The sentence has 92 characters, and the word “had” appears eleven times! With run-length encoding, the sentence might look like this: 1James 1while 1John 11had 1a 1better 1effect 1on 1the 1teacher. The idea is that before each word, we add a number indicating how many consecutive times it shows up. That lets us skip every consecutive occurrence after the first. If we omit the spaces, this sentence has 54 characters — a 42% reduction from the original! It’s not an all sunshine and lollipops, though. Consider this classic pangram: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. That sentence is 44 characters and no words repeat consecutively. Here’s what it might look like with run-length encoding: 1The 1quick 1brown 1fox 1jumps 1over 1the 1lazy 1dog. 53 characters — a 20% increase! What gives? The issue is that when you compress something, you need to add metadata so that you can figure out what it looked like originally. Compression algorithms make assumptions about what patterns will occur in the original data in order to optimize the metadata. If the assumptions are right, the compressed data (including the metadata) is much smaller than the original data. But if the assumptions are wrong, the “compressed” data can even end up bigger than it was before! Our assumption here is that run-length encoding will not be a good fit for LWW Register states, since there are three separate pieces of data that can vary independently. All blank spaces are the same, though, which makes them an excellent candidate for run-length encoding! Rather than somehow representing each individual blank space in the array, we’ll store a number indicating how many consecutive blank spaces we came across. That lets us know exactly which coordinates the next pixel will be at. Now that we’re no longer storing the coordinates of each pixel, we also need to store the width of the image. That way, when we’re decompressing the data, we know when the pixels should wrap onto the next row. Here’s what the data looks like now. Since we’re now using a lot of numbers without any labels, I added some comments so it’s clear what everything is referring to. { \"uuids\": [\"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796\", \"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3\"], \"palette\": [\"fff\", \"6c4fff\"], \"width\": 100, \"data\": [ [/* uuid index */ 0, /* timestamp */ 3, /** palette index */ 0], [/* uuid index */ 0, /* timestamp */ 4, /** palette index */ 0], [/* uuid index */ 0, /* timestamp */ 2, /** palette index */ null], 97, // run of blank pixels [/* uuid index */ 1, /* timestamp */ 2, /** palette index */ 1], [/* uuid index */ 1, /* timestamp */ 3, /** palette index */ 1] ] } Notice how the data array is not homogenous: it contains either a tuple of peer ID, timestamp and color ID or a number indicating how many consecutive blank spaces there are. Using run-length encoding brings us to 129kb — just over 80% smaller than our uncompressed data. We’re doing pretty well, but those last few percentage points are the trickiest ones to eke out. We’re gonna need to try something new. Binary Encoding So far, we’re at just more than an 80% decrease. That’s pretty good, and we could probably get it even smaller if we stopped using JSON. But we’re running into a fundamental limit: it’s inefficient to store things as text. To get much further, we’ll need to use binary encoding. When we’re using a plain text format like JSON, we think in characters. When we’re using binary encoding, we think in bytes. A byte holds an integer from 0 to 255. If we consider groups of bytes as a single unit, it can hold much higher numbers — for example, two bytes can hold up to 65535.3 If this is too abstract, here’s how it works in JavaScript: a binary file is just a Uint8Array. Each element of the array is a single byte. Using multiple bytes to represent numbers greater than 255 gets a little tricky, but this is the basic idea. The numbers can represent anything we want them to. One common way to interpret them is as ASCII, meaning each number corresponds to an alphanumeric character. Another way is just as the number they hold, meaning a byte that holds 127 would represent the number 127. We’ll interpret bytes in a few different ways as we create our format. We’ll define a format similar to RIFF, which serves as the basis for file types like WAV and AVI. It’s made up of “chunks”, each of which has two sections: “data”, which is the actual information we need to store, and a “header” that identifies the chunk type and tells us how to actually parse the bytes in the data. First, binary files usually have a magic number that identifies the format. Ours will represent the ASCII text CRDT, so the first four bytes of the file will be 43 52 44 54.4 That goes in the “info” chunk, along with the width of our artboard. Note that this is in hexadecimal, so each of those numbers is base 16. In decimal, they come out to 67 82 68 84. Here’s a diagram of the binary file. The first part contains a human-readable overview; all the data is labeled, and the values are in a format that makes sense to us (for example, you can see that the magic number reads “CRDT” and that the artboard is 100 pixels wide). The second column contains the raw bytes in the file; each byte shows its index in the file and the hex digits representing its number from 0 to 255 (or 00 to ff in hex). You can hover over data on the left and see the corresponding bytes highlighted, and vice versa. After the info chunk, the file has three more chunks: one to hold our UUID table, one to hold our palette table and one to hold our pixel data. We’ll start with the UUID chunk. The header consists of two parts: Four bytes that read UUID in ASCII. Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.5 Why do we need to know the length in advance? With binary, we don’t usually use delimiters like quotes or brackets to indicate when things begin or end. Instead, we expect to know the size in bytes of each item in advance. That way, we can just go through the items that many bytes at a time, counting up until we’ve gone through the total number of bytes. The UUID chunk’s data is just all the peer UUIDs, one after the other. These each took up 34 characters (including quotes) in our JSON, but here we can represent each of them in a mere 16 bytes. Just like before, the key will be the index of each UUID — so the first one in the chunk will be 0, the second will be 1, etc. Here’s the full UUID chunk. Each white block represents one item in the chunk data — in this case, a UUID: The next chunk is the palette chunk. The header looks similar to the UUID chunk header: Four bytes that read PLTT in ASCII.6 Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes. Yeah, we’re missing a few letters, but we need each chunk name to fit in the same number of bytes. The palette chunk’s data is also similar to the UUID chunk’s data: all the colors, one after the other. When we represented these with hex codes, they took up either five or eight bytes, but here we can represent each one in a concise three bytes — one for each RGB color channel.7 Remember how each RGB color channel is an integer between 0 and 255? It’s not a coincidence that those are the exact numbers you can fit in a single byte! This chunk has one extra quirk: when writing to the data, we skip the first item’s place (so the first color starts as the fourth byte of data, or tenth byte including the header). That might not make sense now, but we’ll learn why in a minute. Here’s the full palette chunk: The last chunk is the data chunk. You know the drill by now: Four bytes that read DATA in ASCII. Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes. That’s the header. There are two types of items that can appear in the data chunk: pixels and blanks. Each item will start with a single byte “tag” indicating which type it is — 0 for blank and 1 for pixel. Blank items are easy. After the tag, they have two single bytes indicating how many consecutive blank spaces they represent. There’s a tradeoff here: by using two bytes to indicate the run length, a single blank item can represent up to 65,535 blank spaces. But then every blank item needs to use two bytes to represent the number of spaces — even if none of them need the second byte. If we used one byte, it would mean each blank item is more compact, but if there are more than 255 blank pixels in a row we’d need to use two or more consecutive blank items to represent them. Pixel items are a bit more complicated. Remember, each pixel is really a LWW Register, which has three pieces of information: the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp and the value. After the tag, a pixel item has a section for each one: A byte for the peer ID, indicating its index in the UUID chunk. A byte for the timestamp.8 A byte for the color, indicating its index in the palette chunk. Using one byte for the timestamp makes each pixel smaller, but limits us to a maximum timestamp of 255. Lifting that limit would mean adding another byte to every pixel — even if every timestamp is below that amount. Since we know the maximum timestamp in advance, we could make an optimization here: use two bytes to store the timestamp if and only if one of the timestamps is above 255. Saving one byte per pixel sounds small, but that reduces the size of a 100x100 image by a full 10kb! We also need a way to store erased pixels. In the JSON format, we stored null as a way to indicate that the pixel had been added and then erased. In binary, there’s no null — all we have are bytes. That’s why we skipped the first three bytes when writing the palette chunk: we know that no color will use the 0 index. If any pixel has 0 as its index, that pixel was erased. Here’s our full file. As you hover over pixel data that refers to items in the UUID and palette chunks, you’ll see arrows pointing back to the actual data in those chunks. This gets us down to just 40kb. An RGB color takes up three bytes, and at this size we’re representing it with only a single byte of overhead! At an almost 94% reduction from the uncompressed data, we’ve already done a great job and could probably stop here if we wanted. But we can take it even further. Run-Length Binary Encoding We’re in the home stretch now. The info, UUID and palette chunks are about as compact as can be, but we can save a bunch of space in the data chunk. If you recall a couple sections ago, the reason we run-length encoded the only blank spaces was that each pixel had three pieces of information that could vary independently: the timestamp, the peer ID of the last writer and the color. We’re going to split those up into individual chunks — one for each piece of information. Within each chunk, there will be only one single thing that can vary between items, which will let us use run-length encoding on each individual piece of data. So instead of one data chunk, we’ll have three: a writer chunk, a color chunk and a timestamp chunk. The writer and color chunks are very similar to each other. Their headers have four bytes that read WRTR (for the writer chunk) or COLR (for the color chunk) in ASCII and two bytes for the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes. Each item in these chunks takes up three bytes: one for the index of the corresponding item in the UUID or palette chunk, and two for the length of the run. You might notice that there are two items in the writer data, but three items in the color data. It means that — going from the top left pixel to the bottom right — the peer who wrote to each pixel changes twice, but the color changes three times. Because we’re now keeping track of each kind of data separately, we can compress them without worrying about the others.9 One downside is that our data is a bit more confusing: items at the same index in each category might not refer to the same pixel. This is a tradeoff of compressing data: the more we squeeze it into as little space as possible, the less it resembles the original thing we’re compressing. The final chunk is the timestamp chunk. The header has four bytes that read TIME in ASCII, and two bytes for the length of the data items in bytes. Each item in the timestamp chunk starts with a single byte representing the timestamp of that pixel. We can use a clever trick here to disambiguate blank pixels from drawn pixels. When we instantiate a LWW Register, the timestamp is set to 1. There will never be a register with a timestamp of 0, which means we can use that value to indicate a blank pixel. We’ll use the same run-length encoding strategy from the previous binary format. If the timestamp is a positive number, the next byte will be the next timestamp. But if the timestamp is 0, we’ll interpret the next two bytes as the length of the run of blank pixels.10 Why not run-length encode all the timestamps? In my (very limited) testing, the timestamps varied enough that run-length encoding non-blank pixels wasted space. That also lets us save a bit of space by ignoring runs of blank pixels in the writer and color chunks, by which I mean that a blank pixel doesn’t end the run of a UUID or color. Only when we see a different UUID or color do we start a new run. We consider the timestamp chunk to be the ultimate authority on whether a pixel is blank: if the timestamp is 0, then it doesn’t matter what we think the UUID or color is. Here’s the full file: This version of our format comes in at 14kb. That’s a 98% decrease from our initial 648kb, and it’s 50% smaller than the uncompressed RGB data — we’re using less than one and a half bytes per pixel! If you’re curious how the formats stack up when the canvas isn’t blank, here’s the benchmark image with all compression formats compared: Conclusion As you can see, even though state-based CRDTs require their whole state to be synced between peers, it’s possible to for the actual data transferred to be significantly more efficient. We took a CRDT state weighing in at 648kb and reduced its size by almost 98% to only 14kb! The optimization techniques here are inspired by Martin Kleppmann’s video CRDTs: The Hard Parts. He and Ink and Switch managed to reduce the gzipped size of a 100kb plain text file with CRDT metadata to only 114kb — less than a 10% increase over the uncompressed plain text data (and compressing text is significantly harder than the pixel data example we just went through). This all might seem like a lot of busywork to get back to a reasonable baseline. But in practice, there are CRDT libraries available that have already made these or similar optimizations for you, including but not limited to: Automerge Yjs Collabs There’s also a great website called crdt.tech that has a list of CRDT libraries, as well as blog posts and academic papers.

Sorting, RLE, etc, are all going to lead to a smaller resulting binary after going through the generalized algorithm.You&#x27;re also going to be relying on heuristics that may fail. Zstd has no idea that your UUIDs are going to repeat, it doesn&#x27;t know to dictionary encode them or to create frequency mappings. What it ends up doing is unlikely to be as effective as doing the work ahead of time, then allowing zstd to find the interesting and complex patterns that arise out of your encoded format. reply ledauphin 11 hours agoparentprevthe storage format may not be the only consideration - it may be preferable to have an in-memory representation that is also inexpensive. reply greiskul 15 hours agoparentprevI wonder if using the rsync algorithm would also help? From looking at the state changes done in one CRDT in one machine and another, both states still share a lot of things in common. So to merge A in machine 1, with B in machine 2, you can rsync A to B in machine 2 without overwriting B, but just having to send the deltas. My understanding is that there are crdts that are able to send over just the operations done, but for simplicity, for a full state crdt, this might be easier and almost as efficient than a specific algorithm. reply simonw 16 hours agoprevThis is SO good.

If you can perform a mapping to integers you should really consider it. Not only will your UUIDs take up 2x the space of a 64bit integer, they&#x27;ll compress horribly by comparison. Integer compression is so good these days you can compress integers such that they basically end up taking up ~1&#x2F;2 a byte instead of 8. Doing that with UUID v4s is fundamentally not going to work.The article mentions RLE, which is also incredibly good for integer IDs if you diff-encode them, since ids are typically sequential with no or small gaps. Diff + RLE can turn your encoded structure into ~1 byte.Also, incredible website. The interactivity is so fun.I did something similar to this very recently where I took a dataset and just continuously applied data encoding methods to it. It was much smaller in memory and compressed with zstd to a smaller size as well. I&#x27;ve found that &#x27;prepping&#x27; data before using a generalized compression algorithm has significant gains both for encode&#x2F;decode performance + the output size. These were, incidentally, CRDT operations :DYour blog posts are great, keep it up reply CodesInChaos 17 hours agoparentIf you care about compressability, you can simply use a different way of generating UUIDs, instead of switching to another type. For example initializing a 128-bit counter when starting the process and incrementing it for each number generated. This should compress almost as well as sequential integers, while still being collision resistant without coordination or persistent state. reply greiskul 14 hours agorootparentI have never seen this strategy described. Is there any literature on it? Cause it does seem to be that this would be as good as the other algorithms for generating UUIDs, but faster and with the benefit of compression. It would make resulting UUIDs easier to guess, but that has never been a design goal of UUIDs anyway. reply vlovich123 14 hours agorootparentThis method doesn’t scale in a distributed system. Two machines running this algorithm will generate conflicts which violates the “universal” part of UUID which means you can run the same algorithm anywhere and you won’t get a conflict. So if you want to make this unique, you have to make a remote query to generate the UID uniquely. Examples of this are Snowflake. Also Sled (the database written in Rust) does a variant of this but it’s not a distributed system per se (ie generates unique identifiers globally on a single machine across process restarts which is useful for transaction IDs).The current SOTA as I understand it is to have the timestamp be the most significant digits and a random value in the least (ULID, UUIDv7 etc). That way you get temporal locality for the UUID which is typically an indexed column where that helps for storage a bit (not so much for lookups because it’s still a random value relative to other concurrently accessed UIDs being input into the system) reply paulgb 12 hours agorootparentAlthough CodesInChaos didn&#x27;t specify the initialization, I assume the intent is that each machine would randomly initialize their counter, in order to prevent collisions. While collisions are possible in any scheme without coordination, I suspect that 128 bits is enough entropy for this to be extremely improbable. reply greiskul 10 hours agorootparentYup, and I am curious about the math on collisions with this scheme. Cause 128 bits is a lot of entropy, and I would expect this scheme to have similar collision resistance of \"it never happens with good RNG\" as regular uuids, but a proof would be nice. reply insanitybit 10 hours agorootparentYeah, intuitively I assume that the gaps between any two UUID guesses will be sufficiently large such that you can increment a lot without overlap but... until someone shows me the math, I don&#x27;t love the idea. reply CodesInChaos 10 hours agorootparentprevI meant using a random initial value. This will make collisions less likely than v4 UUIDs (because the quadratic scaling of the birthday problem only applies to counter initialization), however once you get one collision you get many. reply vlovich123 3 hours agorootparentThat’s an interesting approach, but what’s the use case you’re thinking of? There’s no correlation of UUIDs across nodes like there is with something like UUIDv7 or ULIDs.I guess you’ll still have batches of locality depending on the uptime of the server which might be useful and generation would of course be significantly faster although I doubt many applications are really bottlenecks by UUID generation speed. reply insanitybit 17 hours agorootparentprevYep. Different UUIDs will have different characteristics when compressed. Still, if you can afford to just have &#x27;1, 2, 3, ..&#x27; as IDs that&#x27;s hard to beat. reply mweidner 10 hours agoparentprevOne idea is just to use fewer random bits in peerIDs. Yjs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.yjs.dev&#x2F;) gets away with just 32 random bits. If you compromise and use 64 random bits, then even a very popular doc with 1 million lifetime peerIDs will have ahow expensive UUIDs areI don&#x27;t quite get it. The normal string encoding of a UUID (d92b13b6-6780-4b98-82cc-d469dcdd42ab) clearly requires more bytes (36B) than the actual UUID itself (16B). The string encoding is for showing to users, it&#x27;s not what you store in your DB, or your CRDT -- for that, you use the actual 16-byte value.> Not only will your UUIDs take up 2x the space of a 64bit integer, they&#x27;ll compress horribly by comparison. Integer compression is so good these days you can compress integers such that they basically end up taking up ~1&#x2F;2 a byte instead of 8. Doing that with UUID v4s is fundamentally not going to work.Yes, UUIDs are 128 bits, and 64 bit integers are 64 bits, but in both cases you&#x27;re storing them as raw bytes -- or, maybe, integers, sure. Whatever compression works on your int64s will work just as well on your UUID int128s. reply gipp 12 hours agorootparent> Whatever compression works on your int64s will work just as well on your UUID int128s.That&#x27;s not true in general; it depends on how the ints are distributed. UUIDs are, by design, distributed in a way that&#x27;s pretty much maximally unfriendly to compression reply jahewson 15 hours agorootparentprevI assume they are referring specifically to a monotonic integer sequence. This will compress and index very nicely (low entropy) whereas v4 UUIDs are random and will not (high entropy). This is the same principle that explains why gzip works well on text but not photos. reply kiitos 14 hours agorootparentUsually you use UUIDs when you don&#x27;t want your IDs to be guessable. reply insanitybit 10 hours agorootparentThat is definitely not why the vast, vast majority of people choose UUIDs, though it is a nice property of them. The reason people choose them is because you can generate them without any synchronization in a distributed system.To reply to your initial point:> Whatever compression works on your int64s will work just as well on your UUID int128s.This is not the case. Compressing non-random 64bit values (such as the ones in the article - they are sequential) is going to be way more effective than compressing UUIDs. UUIDs do not compress, you&#x27;ll likely end up with a larger output than the input.What the article does, essentially, is a dictionary encoding pass. The duplicate, expensive UUIDs are mapped to small, sequential integers.I explained elsewhere that you can turn nearly arbitrary numbers of sequential integers into a few bits each. reply jakelazaroff 14 hours agoparentprevThank you so much! I spent a long time on these diagrams haha. reply stylepoints 17 hours agoparentprev> Integer compression is so good these days you can compress integers such that they basically end up taking up ~1&#x2F;2 a byte instead of 8This needs an explanation. reply insanitybit 17 hours agorootparentWell if your integers are sequential you can encode huge numbers of them using diff + RLE in just a few bytes, likely far fewer than 1&#x2F;2 a byte on average, for the right dataset (in theory you can store 1,2,3,4,5...10_000 in 2 bytes).But for other integer datasets there&#x27;s FastPFORhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lemire&#x2F;FastPForThe linked papers there will talk about techniques that can be used to store multiple 32bit integers into a single byte, etc. Integer compression is pretty powerful if your data isn&#x27;t random. The thing with UUIDs is that your data is pretty random - even a UUIDv7 contains a significant amount of random data. reply touisteur 16 hours agorootparentAlso had great success with Roaring Bitmaps, a bit further on the compression&#x2F;ease of manipulation axis.Edit: I see you&#x27;re already linking to Daniel Lemire&#x27;s github, so I guess you&#x27;re familiar with them, just mentioning them, since it&#x27;s in a comment thread like this one that I discovered them. reply fragmede 14 hours agoprevWith all due respect (which is a lot; this blog post series is quite good!), it&#x27;s not quite 98%. The webserver will gzip it in transit, and the first, most inefficient JSON bit of data gzips, from 255 bytes, down to 152 bytes. 152 is still 27% larger than the final, binary, format, of 119 bytes.Not that I think this optimization is unnecessary - I very much quite enjoy products that use CRDTs under the hood and undoubtedly had this sort of optimization and evolution to a binary format from JSON done. But I wanted to give a very brief but bigger system picture of where this fits. reply giovannibonetti 11 hours agoparentTransmitting it is not the only concern.

The videos might take a few moments to load. Previous Next Previous Next Abstract This paper targets high-fidelity and real-time view synthesis of dynamic 3D scenes at 4K resolution. Recently, some methods on dynamic view synthesis have shown impressive rendering quality. However, their speed is still limited when rendering high-resolution images. To overcome this problem, we propose 4K4D, a 4D point cloud representation that supports hardware rasterization and enables unprecedented rendering speed. Our representation is built on a 4D feature grid so that the points are naturally regularized and can be robustly optimized. In addition, we design a novel hybrid appearance model that significantly boosts the rendering quality while preserving efficiency. Moreover, we develop a differentiable depth peeling algorithm to effectively learn the proposed model from RGB videos. Experiments show that our representation can be rendered at over 400 FPS on the DNA-Rendering dataset at 1080p resolution and 80 FPS on the ENeRF-Outdoor dataset at 4K resolution using an RTX 4090 GPU, which is 30 × × faster than previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art rendering quality. Method (a) By applying the space-carving algorithm, we extract the initial cloud sequence 𝑥 , 𝑡 x,t of the target scene. A 4D feature grid is predefined to assign a feature vector to each point, which is then fed into MLPs for the scene geometry and appearance. (b) The geometry model is based on the point location, radius, and density, which forms a semi-transparent point cloud. % and spherical harmonics coefficients 𝑠 s. (c) The appearance model consists of a piece-wise constant IBR term 𝑐 𝑖 𝑏 𝑟 c ibr and a continuous SH model 𝑐 𝑠 ℎ c sh .

Jiang, Jia Deng, Stella Biderman, Sean Welleck We present Llemma, a large language model for mathematics. We continue pretraining Code Llama on the Proof-Pile-2, a mixture of scientific papers, web data containing mathematics, and mathematical code, yielding Llemma. On the MATH benchmark Llemma outperforms all known open base models, as well as the unreleased Minerva model suite on an equi-parameter basis. Moreover, Llemma is capable of tool use and formal theorem proving without any further finetuning. We openly release all artifacts, including 7 billion and 34 billion parameter models, the Proof-Pile-2, and code to replicate our experiments.

In particular, they show a 3% increase in proves solved over COPRA on the MiniF2F Lean dataset, but in COPRA&#x27;s own paper they show that they prove about 18.5% fewer theorems than Proverbot9001 on the CompCert dataset (their pitch is that they are faster, but not better at proving, than other tools). Assuming COPRA isn&#x27;t just way better at Lean than Coq (there should be some amount of difference, but given that it&#x27;s the same algorithm run on a uniform interface over Coq and Lean it&#x27;s unlikely to be large), Llemma should be proving 10-15% fewer proofs than Proverbot9001&#x27;s algorithm. There&#x27;s a bit of trickiness to trying to do this kind of cross-benchmark comparison, and COPRA picks a bit of a weird dataset to compare to Proverbot9001 on to save costs, but they also use a slightly older version which has worse results. So it probably still washes out to the best LLM-based provers being about 10-15% worse at proving theorems than the best specialized models.EDIT: To be clear, that&#x27;s 10-15% of the total theorems in a test set, not a relative 10-15% improvement. Given that solve rates for tools are in the 10-30% range, that&#x27;s much more than a relative 10-15% improvement. reply Vetch 13 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think the right way to think about its utility is as a replacement. I see it in terms of a NNUE for Stockfish type augmentation, where a small neural network supercharges search. Small neural network because no LLM, not even GPT4, is good enough that the time lost evaluating with them is gained in disproportionally less search done.Other uses are: better autocomplete from comments for Coq and Lean VScode envs than generalist tools.Translation from NL sketch to formal proof. This is different from autocomplete in that it should generate long attempts as an automated spitballer. Leave it running a a long time to see if it finds anything when you&#x27;re stuck. This works for formal and informal proofs but the latter gets no feedback (this is imagining future tunes able to make better use of interactive prover feedback).Translating formal proofs to natural language.Combine it with RAG and have it pull in and summarize references from your personal paper collection and the internet. Particularly useful in place of search when you don&#x27;t have the vocabulary for a concept. As a basis for non-code based autocomplete of mathematical work.I see unbounded potential for this combination. And a natural setting where between cost of search and the symbolic prover doing the heavy lifting, it&#x27;s one of those areas that naturally lends itself to specialist Open over API models. reply aSanchezStern 12 hours agorootparentOh, I think you might misunderstand what I&#x27;m comparing it to. The other tools, like Proverbot9001, are exactly the NNUE scenario you describe, where a small neural network guides a search procedure to find proofs; they are more effective at finding formal proofs than Llemma. For other tasks, like non-formal proof generation, Llemma has novel results as far as I know; it&#x27;s just in terms of producing formal proofs that it currently seems to lack as compared to the state of the art. reply Vetch 8 hours agorootparentAh you&#x27;re right. That makes sense. The autocomplete, informal proofs, translation or autoformalization, reference, search, feedback interactive assistant use-cases do seem promising though. reply jychang 8 hours agorootparentprevWhen do you think we’ll have something that can do “verify this proof of the ABC conjecture” and it would check the proof? reply schoen 4 hours agorootparentIf the proof is written in a formal language, we have that now!

Anybody knows how they&#x27;d compare? reply aSanchezStern 14 hours agoparentNot directly, but COPRA which they compare to (and show about 3% more theorems proved than) is based on GPT-4 using an agent framework. And in the COPRA paper, they compare to using GPT-4 directly as a one-shot, and find it can only get 10% of theorems in miniF2F, as opposed to 23% with their agent based approach. So if the eval line up correctly, we would see GPT-4 one-shot proving 10.6% of theorems in miniF2F, as opposed to Llemma-7b proving 26.23%, a pretty significant improvement.

(This list is labelled \"Fun\"! IT'S FUN!!! DON'T YOU LOVE WORKING???) Blog about your favourite companies and brands (I closed the tab before my head could explode) And if I do all this, I can become a \"thought leader\" (huh?) and drive organic traffic! Then my readers will follow my ~brand~! I get that blogging is a big thing for businesses and influencers now, but I didn't realize just how obsessed the blogging landscape is with this corpo nonsense. I checked Google as well just to make sure that my search engine of choice wasn't skewing the results, but the pages I clicked on still overwhelmingly featured business-focused prompts. Or, even when the prompts were personal in nature, the introduction to the page promised me that these ideas would convert my readers into customers, grow my numbers, and get me more traffic than ever before!!! (To rake in that ad money, natch.) It's just a bit depressing to see how much it's all become a numbers game, whether those numbers are dollars in your pocket or followers on your Instagram. I'm probably saying nothing new to anybody who's been on the blogging scene for some time, but as a newcomer who's just here to write creatively and have fun, it was a stark reminder of how corporate the web has become. Why is that the end goal of blogging? Of writing? Just to make money and grow our followers? To increase our traffic so we can expose our visitors to 300 repetitive ads that take up their entire phone screen? To \"convert\" our readers into our customers, because them reading and enjoying what we have to say simply isn't enough? Personally, I want nothing to do with it. I'm sick of everything having to be a hustle now, even something personal like sharing our ramblings with strangers on the internet.3 I have little else to say other than that I hate how capitalism ruins everything fun it touches. I'll continue to write about things that make me feel passionate, not how to make money or gain followers. And if the day comes where my blog ever features a sponsored post or sketchy weight loss ad, just shoot me in the face. ...In the end, perhaps I have to give those listicles a little bit of credit. They did give me the idea for my next blog post. 🤷♀ Well, sort of. I really want to write about Baldur's Gate 3, how it compares to Bioware titles, and how my personal feelings on said titles have changed over the years—but it would be pretty silly to do so before I've finished Baldur's Gate 3. I'm 100+ hours in now and just barely got inside the city walls!↩ Sorry, maybe I'm being mean here. I'm sure there are some influencers with valuable life advice to share. But a lot of them are privileged 19-year-olds who became famous by stealing other people's Tiktok dances, so you'll have to forgive me for being a skeptic.↩ I imagine many Bear users feel the same as I do, given the nature of this platform. I'm glad that writing for writing's sake still seems to be a thing in these quieter corners of the web.↩ #blogging #capitalism 148 *back to top subscribe via *email or *rss Made with Bear ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ",

(whiona.me) 216 points by bovermyer 14 hours ago| hidepastfavorite157 comments marssaxman 13 hours agoI remember when the blogging world became \"obsessed with this corpo nonsense\", and it was a very strange experience. Blogs had been a kind of distributed social media, global conversation among creative weirdos, but eventually some tipping point of public awareness happened and seemingly overnight people just would not shut up about the idea of making money writing a blog, making a living as a blogger, which made about as much sense to me as the idea of going into business as a dinner-party guest, or a book club participant. But they were persistent, they were noisy, there were eventually more of them than there were of us, and... well. That was a long time ago now, and I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to start looking for interesting blogs of the old style, if they still exist. reply PheonixPharts 13 hours agoparentContent marketing ruined blogging, just like SEO ruined search.I used to work with a lot of content marketers when it started to get hot. SEO was doing particularly poorly for a period (Google used to resist seo rather than reward it) and people realized that if you started writing \"authentic\" content, then people would organically link to it and it would increase your ranking.Then social media furthered this problem by people mindlessly sharing content they never read but just looked engaging.Marketing robots where just churning out content on blogs because eventually you would just hit search engine gold by nail the correct topic for some long tail search term. In my own domain, the atrocious \"Towards Data Science\" is a great example of this (except their \"brilliant\" innovation was to replace marketing robots with people eager to pad their resume). The content is largely garbage, but it looks about right and is easily shareable.Today, whether you like it or not, if you want to make people to see your blog at all you have to think at least a bit like a content marketer to get seen at all. Consider Jay Alammar&#x27;s fantastic blog [0], which is very high quality content, but still requires a tremendous amount of polish and marketing to survive. All of this has made it impossible to create the network required for a \"global conversation among creative weirdos\".

The death of Google Reader.Google Reader came onto the scene and essentially destroyed all incumbents. Even if you used an independent client, the syncing was almost certainly based on your Google Reader account.And Google Reader also provided a social discovery component which no one even tried competing with because how could you.The sudden death of Google Reader was followed by a glut of rushed alternatives, which meant no specific alternative could get sufficient acceptance.There were a lot of things that hurt the blogosphere but most of them would either have naturally withered away (for instance, the commercial crowd would almost certainly have migrated to social media), or could have been figured out (spam blogs could have easily been beaten if the likes of Google were interested).The death of Google Reader, which also happened to coincide with the rise of social media (not a coincidence since Google Reader was killed in order to promote Google’s social media offering), was something the blogosphere could not recover from. reply OfSanguineFire 12 hours agoparentprevI would add also that after the 2008 crisis, the precariat grew, and some bloggers found themselves in it.

Writing about stuff for writings sake and just to get it out of your head into some form is still very much a thing.

And this is where the disaster happens.When companies that index the web make 99.9% of their money selling ads on that index, and the index is a place where wannabes ask the question \"how do I make money on a blog\" ask that question, you gets something not unlike unconstrained algae growth in a badly maintained aquarium of things \"popping out of the woodwork\" to fill that demand.

I have never tried to attract readers, more the opposite.There may be benefits from writing, such as publicity.

Now you can find all of that blog content over in video form on youtube and tiktok. reply meatmanek 10 hours agoparentFunny, I have a similar observation but the opposite opinion: I realized that my favorite major platform these days is Youtube because there&#x27;s a ton of great content there that is harder to find elsewhere. Unfortunately, a lot of that content would be much better in written form.As an example, I recently watched a video about the best weapons in Tears of the Kingdom that was over 40 minutes long, but all that information could have been a ~3000-word blog post. Yes, some of the information is best conveyed in video form (demonstrating certain effects with in-game footage), but a lot of the content was essentially just the creator explaining out loud why certain combinations work well. For the bits of information that work better as video, the author could embed a short video into the article.It probably would&#x27;ve been a lot less effort for the creator to make a listicle or blog post with a section for each of the weapons shown, and it would certainly save the viewers a lot of time. But then such a blog post would probably make way less money than the Youtube video. Youtube does a better-than-average job of paying creators for popular content, and they&#x27;ve fostered a network effect where audiences go to Youtube when looking for certain types of information. All this means that the incentives push people to create video content even when another medium would suit the content better. reply Gud 4 hours agoparentprevText is faster and searchable.

The ideology of capitalism influences us in certain ways, such as desiring to capitalize off our audience, the goal subtly shifts to increasing metrics such as readers, likes, shares.What really changed about blogging is that people started to care about these metrics more and more. In the early internet one wrote a blog post without really expecting anyone to read it! ( although someone stumbling upon it was paradoxically more likely before we switched to social media platforms etc ) As such I&#x27;d argue the author wrote more authentically. reply renewiltord 9 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s still going on, and it&#x27;s naturally micro-communities.

I think the shift in internet culture towards everyone being an “expert” in their domain as opposed to sharing their experience (or sharing “vibes” if you will) has been very toxic.One example: was talking to my cousin the other day, there was a YouTube feature she misses called video replies. Around the 2010s, that feature was used in hair and makeup communities to share videos purely about an experience or journey. So you wouldn’t necessarily be reviewing a product for general purpose, just saying “this is how I used this thing and how it worked for me.”Now? It is so (potentially) lucrative to be an influencer making normative statements that not doing so seems pointless, even looked down upon as possibly spreading misinformation.

There is a noticeable absence of films that capture the pulse-pounding chess game of ground-controlled interception (GCI) – a sensation that is only amplified when lives are on the line. Enter “Patlabor 2: The Movie,” an obscure, contemplative anime film from Japanese director Mamouru Oshii of “Ghost In the Shell” fame. In between intricate artwork, a thrilling storyline about a plot to bring civil war to early 2000s Japan, and musings on the ethics of the application of military force, one scene stands out as the single most realistic portrayal of GCI ever put to film. As tactical displays fill the screen and ominous music plays alongside frantic radio traffic, a scene unfolds that’s so technically dense and authentic, we at Task & Purpose had to consult several subject matter experts to make sure we understood exactly what was going on. The scene takes place in the winter of 2002 in Japan. A rogue F-16J aircraft fires a TV-guided missile — meaning a missile that uses a camera feed for steering — at the Tokyo Bay Bridge, destroying the middle section and throwing Japan into a state of fear not experienced since Curtis LeMay’s strategic bombing of the mainland during World War II. Only days later, Fuchu Central Strategic Operations Center (SOC) detects a sortie of three more F-16Js, call sign “Wyvern,” this time armed with bombs, on a direct flight from Misawa Air Base to the heart of Tokyo. With only minutes to spare, and suspecting another attack, four F-15 STOL/MTDs — a highly maneuverable F-15 prototype — are scrambled to intercept on two separate paths in the hopes that one of the aircraft will make contact with the incoming bogies. Fuchu officials guide the F-15s, call signs “Wizard” and “Priest,” to the incoming F-16Js. The F-15s attempt to make contact, but Wizard cannot see Wyvern or pick them up on radar, despite being nearly on top of them. (Gif via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”) Wizard disappears in a flurry of radio interference, before transmitting via their transponder that they’d been shot down. Wyvern then pivots into a direct trajectory towards Tokyo central, dropping altitude and accelerating, as if making an attack run, and Priest is given clearance from Fuchu SOC to fire as soon as they make radar contact. In addition, Fuchu SOC alerts the Iruma Air Defense Artillery batteries to prepare to engage, now fully anticipating an airborne attack. Civilian air traffic controllers at Narita International Airport scramble to ensure that the incoming aircraft don’t harm passenger planes in holding patterns, further driving home the dire implications of this incursion. Just as Priest prepares to fire, the interference clears, and the targeted aircraft reveal themselves to be Wizard flight, frantically asking for orders. Fuchu SOC immediately calls off the attack, bewildered that the airborne threat has suddenly disappeared, and recalls the interceptors back to base. The entire attack was an elaborate ruse, a hack of the Fuchu SOC radar systems and jamming of their radio communications, in an attempt to cause the responding aircraft to engage each other. At the very least, the digital assailant showed the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force that they had the capability to infiltrate their systems and wreak havoc, sowing further doubt and terror among the ranks. This scene is extremely dense, so we’re going to do a breakdown of exactly what the filmmakers got right, because the detail is as close to real life as it gets (despite the film being a cartoon). High-octane aerial combat movies like “Top Gun” and “Behind Enemy Lines” do not hold a candle to the precision and attention to detail we see in this film, not to mention the chest-thumping thrill ride of the action as it plays out. When I interviewed our subject matter expert, a former Navy strike force analyst, he had this to say: “All of the brevity terms are used properly, nothing feels out of place like the typical Hollywood screenwriter trying to sound like the military by using terms they found on Google like a lot of films and shows. The Ground Control Intercept (GCI) depiction is exactly how that would play out (TREBOR vectors PRIEST and WIZARD into the target; the fighters are very reliant on the controllers view of the battlespace with only targeting capabilities with their radar). The radar screens aren’t the spinning ‘sonar blip’ bullshit you get in a lot of games, movies, and animation. It’s very true to the displays you actually see in a control tower, with the IFF/squawk codes identifying each aircraft or flight.” So, with that in mind, let’s dive deeper into that one scene. The technology The film uses period-accurate monochrome radar displays that refresh only when the radar beam makes another circuit. Tracked air assets are marked with their “squawk codes,” rather than plane names. (Gif via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”) The choice of aircraft is another authentic touch. The F-15 STOL/MTD, was an F-15 variant designed in the 1980s to test the concept of thrust vectoring and super-mobility, and is one that few people aside from those who read Jane’s Fighting Planes books would have known about in 1993. The radios are harsh, muffled, and staticky, and the pilots’ breathing interrupts their dialogue, which is a very real thing. The pilots have to be guided onto their targets due to the fact that features like sensor data sharing between aircraft were only in their infancy at the time of the film’s release, meaning the pilots had to manually steer their narrow-view onboard radar onto the target by taking verbal directions from the SOC, whose more powerful 360-degree radar was much better equipped for locating the general position of targets. The dialogue (Screenshot via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”) While most movies get radio traffic wrong with amateurish phrases like “over and out” or “I repeat,” Patlabor characters not only use believable dialogue during radio transmissions, but also speak in heavily accented English. This is a huge detail that most aviation films neglect, even ones that depict NATO allies, which often simply feature the pilots speaking their native language despite the fact that English is the universal language of air traffic communication. The pilots and air traffic controllers speak in measured, subdued tones, suggesting a high level of training and preparedness. Even the air battle manager and director speak to each other in a manner that, while grim, is still calm and businesslike, underscoring the fact that while the situation is quite precarious, shots have not yet been fired. This is contrasted with the excited, terrified shouts of the civilian air traffic controllers at Narita International Airport, which add to the tension of the scene. The pilots and controllers give their headings in degrees magnetic, saying the numbers individually like “one-niner-zero” instead of “one-ninety,” and provide their altitude in angels (thousands of feet) which adds another layer of credibility. The terms used, such as “no joy” (no visual contact) “bogey dope” (request target heading, altitude, and airspeed) and “say again” as opposed to “repeat,” are spot on, preventing a good deal of cringe from those in the know. Tactics, techniques, and procedures (Screenshot via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”) Contrast this scene with the hyped-up, Aqua Net-and-cocaine pacing of the air combat scenes of classics like “Top Gun,” and you’ll immediately see that this is a more measured, authentic approach to how air operations work. For starters, one of the biggest things that military aviation movies often neglect is that the airborne radars of fighter aircraft are very limited, only sweeping in a narrow ray in front of the aircraft to avoid microwaving the pilots and crew. It stands to reason that Wizard and Priest flights would be heavily dependent on the Fuchu Central SOC for guidance as to the general vicinity of the intruders, and the scene illustrates this beautifully. The incoming aircraft are identified, radio hails are sent up, and when there’s no response, interceptors are launched. Once the aircraft checks in, the air traffic controllers give guidance, and the initial intercept time is revised while the pilots begin to search for the target visually and with their onboard targeting radar. The coordination is continuous, with Fuchu Central SOC feeding Wizard and Priest targeting data while trying to deconflict the situation on the ground, to no avail. When Wizard gets “shot down,” the squawk code “7700,” — the international code for “mayday,” or an airborne emergency – appears onscreen at their last known position. The depiction of a cyber attack Cyberspace is an ever-growing domain of warfare on the modern battlefield, and concerns about its role in a conflict with a near-peer adversary are becoming more commonplace. This scene presents three forms of electronic warfare: GPS spoofing, hacking, and signal jamming. The culmination of this multi-pronged cyber attack is when two friendly aircraft come within seconds of firing on one another. (Gif via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”) In the film, this is done to try to incite a civil war, but in real life, GPS spoofing has become so common that hackers sell kits for $300 to allow the user to send false GPS data. Iran has already made dubious claims that they have mounted GPS spoofing attacks on U.S. air assets. The scene demonstrates this when Wizard says “We had heavy jamming and now lost position,” indicating that their communications and their GPS systems were being tampered with. The producers of this film weren’t in possession of any classified information either, since GPS spoofing and jamming was something that even the Iraqis used during Operation Desert Storm in the hopes of defeating GPS-guided bombs aimed at Saddam’s palace. Hacking is another daily reality in the modern world, and cyber attacks against various governments are now common shows of force. While it’s not officially known whether or not any tactical systems have been hacked, as revealed in this scene, the possibility of this happening is still greater than zero. Signal jamming, however, is one of the oldest electronic warfare tricks in the book, and involves flooding entire swaths of frequencies with signal noise, which not only forces the enemy to limit communications, but also makes decryption easier by reducing the number of usable frequencies to a select few. This scene accurately portrays electronic warfare when the adversary coordinates Wizard getting “shot down” on the hacked radar display with heavy signal jamming that prevents Fuchu SOC from making contact with them via radio or transponder, adding to the illusion of Wizard being killed, and preventing Priest from deconflicting the airspace once they make radar contact with what they think is the intruding Wyvern flight. Overall, myself and our subject matter expert both agree that this scene is the most authentic portrayal of air operations ever put to film. Additionally, I interviewed several former military air traffic controllers, strike analysts, and aviators, and their opinion was unanimous: This is pretty dang good. It totally abstains from excessive showmanship, replacing spectacle with the terrifying feeling that something like this could really happen. It’s an outstanding example of how technical detail and thorough authenticity can turn a minor scene, whose only function is to move the storyline forward, into seven minutes of nail-biting suspense.

It&#x27;s not only a matter of differing attitudes towards what to expect from cinema, both Japan vs US and animation vs live-action. There&#x27;s another factor: the US military, and the interests they have in how they&#x27;re depicted on film. Even more specifically, what aspects of their operational standards and capabilities are disseminated to the public. I would not be surprised to find realistic elements in a contemporary American film, that the military provides \"assistance\" to in the form of equipment and consultation, struck. And not because anything is classified (if knowable by the public) or even necessarily sensitive; it&#x27;s just that a component of psychological force projection is the control the military has over what the average person knows about how they operate. A cartoon released 30 years ago depicting Japanese forces may not have had analagous interests breathing down their neck.That&#x27;s my layman&#x27;s take, anyhow. I appreciate the irony. reply Animats 11 hours agoparentThere is a cultural thing. Japan, like the US, has gun nuts. But the ones in Japan don&#x27;t have access to real guns. So there&#x27;s much business in non-functional replica guns. An anime for that market, Gunsmith Cats, came out around 1995. It&#x27;s set in a gun store in Chicago. So the production team from Japan visited Chicago and and went to a real Chicago gun store to see what one looked like.

For one, DCS&#x27;s flight model is based only on open source data, so a lot of fighter&#x27;s statistics are based on speculation and extrapolation. Second, DCS doesn&#x27;t do a lot of EWAR and detection accurately, which is especially important for modern 5th gen fighters. And then of course modern air combat is rarely 1v1 WVR, but it&#x27;s hard to get a couple hundred people running in a single DCS server so there&#x27;s no easy way to show off modern larger scale tactics reply rip_netrunner 11 hours agorootparentHypOps channel on youtube has the most detailed strategic simulations I&#x27;ve seen recently.

Maybe even better in some regards. reply Propelloni 18 hours agorootparentFor me, Patlabor 1 and 2 are thrillers who happen to have mechas in them. Despite the name and the prominent role of the Labor Patrol department the movie is about the police work done by the Patlabor police force or the counter-terror unit in part 2. As a thriller you know who the baddie is from early on. The conclusion is not therefore not the unveiling of the culprit as it would be in a crime movie, but the neutralization of the well-known culprit, quite often by force (why is that?) Here you see mechas battling it out against a fortress, but it could just as well be a SWAT team storming an appartment block and it would be entertaining all the same. I would place it under \"color\" and I agree, it can make all the difference ;) reply PaulHoule 17 hours agorootparentRight, Patlabor is strong even without the mechas.Something I find amusing about the series is almost half the time they are dealing with ghosts instead of criminals. (Thus Patlabor is much about the uncompleted legacy of the past as it is about the problem of the near future.) Ghosts and ghost stories are huge theme in anime that you might miss because the portrayal of ghosts in anime and western culture are very similar qualitatively, but quantitatively I think they turn up a lot more. It&#x27;s much like the way religious professionals turn up more in anime than they do in comparable western media.

    "originLink": "http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html",
    "originBody": "October 2023 One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear. Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business. It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [1] You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on. It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds. The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great. Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive. Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially. YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt. Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling. Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day. What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially. Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life. The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect. [2] That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it. The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression \"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better. [3] The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target. It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors. Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head. The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin. Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds. There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless. This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually. Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns. But don't overoptimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers. What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape. [4] A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one. [5] It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to. The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing. There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations. Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences. [6] A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences. There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance. Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out. [7] The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up. Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. [8] But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you. How should you take advantage of it? The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to. There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. [9] It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children. There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph. Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to. [10] And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early. The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at the limits of knowledge. The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries' combined. [11] This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes. In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns. What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well. [12] This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money. What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I'll never get anywhere. But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there. In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things that don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get. There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio. It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one. The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you. Notes There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error. [1] Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns. [2] Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people. [3] It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother. [4] Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one. [5] Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons. [6] In my twenties I wanted to be an artist and even went to art school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations. [7] In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where the return curve gets really steep. [8] It's unclear exactly what advocates of \"equity\" mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else. It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance. [9] Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past. [10] The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of \"How to Do Great Work.\" As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because after I finished \"How to Do Great Work\" I rewrote it based on that. [11] Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies the ratio has shifted dramatically toward discovery just in the last half century. [12] It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence.

    "commentBody": "Superlinear ReturnsHacker NewspastloginSuperlinear Returns (paulgraham.com) 201 points by jger15 15 hours ago| hidepastfavorite135 comments opportune 1 hour agoThree things:Many, if not most when taken to pedantic conclusions, seemingly-superlinear phenomena are logistic “s-curves”[0]. Even if you’re taking over the entire physical universe, eventually you run out of some limiting growth factor like “total addressable market” or “particles in the the reachable universe.” This isn’t a purely nitpicky point - epidemics and “viral ideas” initially have little interference like this, but when they grow enough they run into interference from immune or previously infected individuals being much harder to infect. Tiktok for example surely had an exponential growth phase among the 14-24 demographic in the US, but by now everyone in that demographic has at least heard of it, and if it did near total penetration into that demographic it’d eventually be limited by the actual number of people able to use their app.There are also log returns, which look superlinear (not really exponential technically) but eventually taper. For example, a skilled aerospace engineer could probably make a crappy paper plane for $0.1, a really good one for $100. But for $10000 it probably wouldn’t be that much better than the $100 if at all. Plenty of things are like that, it’s called diminishing returns…Finally, there are definitely quadratic curves in real life. If you’re looking at communications it’s everywhere, usually as an upper bound or worst case. Additional leaf connections may have their diminishing marginal utility countered by the fact that existing and new connections become incrementally more valuable as the network grows.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Logistic_function reply ad93611 1 minute agoparentCould you please elaborate on the quadratic curves in real life? reply hiAndrewQuinn 8 hours agoprevOf the two sources of superlinear returns here I find step functions the easier one to steer my life happily by. Graduating college is a step function: You go from 0 sheepskin effect to 1 sheepskin effect, and all future employment barriers are made significantly easier to scale. SOC2 compliance is a step that lets you sell 1&#x2F;10 the feature set to 10 times the enterprises at 100 times the subscription price. An exponential return is the fundamental driver, for sure, but the way you get there is often by hurtling over a sequence of steps.One huge example for me: Marriage. I went from a long time with 0 wives, and now I have 1 and everything is much much better. What a step! If this is what PG means by a superlinear return sign me up! reply bartman 1 hour agoparentCan you say more about the impact of SOC2 certifications? We’ve been selling to enterprises for years without any certifications, but with long and intricate security questionnaires needing to be filled out. Does that go away if you have a certification? Our sector isn’t very regulated (video games industry), but the question for SOC2 does come up regularly - however never as a blocker. reply hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour agorootparentOnly in general terms I&#x27;m afraid. You&#x27;re right that it varies by industry: My experience is coming out of banking tech and medical software, where the industries are much more heavily regulated. At my first job out of college I had to do all of my development work 3 VMs deep on a separate laptop partly just so I could comply with all of them -- but we also made total bank because we were the only game in town. reply bartman 33 minutes agorootparentI see, thanks! reply pc86 8 hours agoparentprevJust imagine how great things would be with two wives. reply swagasaurus-rex 5 hours agorootparentThese returns may not be superlinear reply nindalf 4 hours agorootparentIf we never try then we’ll never know. reply csomar 3 hours agorootparentSome societies allow this, maybe we should ask them? reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentLike with everything seemingly exponential, the returns in the real world follow a sigmoid. It turns out for this, the inflection point of that sigmoid is at or slightly above n=1 wives. replylwhi 9 minutes agoprevWhy do we actually want to encourage superlinear returns.Is this something that&#x27;s actually beneficial? reply SunghoYahng 3 hours agoprevI can tell by the title what it&#x27;s all about. Paul&#x27;s essays are always like this. reply coldtea 2 hours agoparentYes. All are about how smart PG is, and how you&#x27;ll make a lot of money if you work as he did.Also everything should be a startup working towards a VC exit. reply nickpp 2 hours agorootparentHis advice in the last 20 years worked for plenty of us. How about your advice? reply mihaic 2 hours agorootparentWhy attack someone for an opinion? I agree that pure cynicism is toxic online, and merely pointing out flaws without solutions can be worse than useless, but that message was not this.I read it as a warning that PG skews his arguments to prove some narrow points and you should be careful when applying them to your life, so you don&#x27;t waste years chasing improbable goals. Plenty failed start-ups exemplify this. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentGP has a fair counterpoint. Yes, PG, like every pundit, is biased. Yes, many of us here read his essays in our younger, more naive years, and it took time to learn how they&#x27;re not as seminal as we thought. But yes, pointing that out is also a meme at this point; it starts to feel like a hash-table dismissal[0], which is not very interesting or useful.--[0] - &#x27;dang described it long ago as behaving as if there was a great hash table in the sky, mapping a person&#x27;s name to the simplest and most well-known fault of them, and as if commenters were somehow obliged to dereference that hash table every time some person&#x27;s name is mentioned. reply simoncion 1 hour agorootparent> But yes, pointing that out is also a meme at this point; it starts to feel like a hash-table dismissal...Eh. I think of it as a warning that younger us (or -at least- younger me) would have very, very, very much appreciated when we were first reading the essays.Yeah, _you_ have had these realizations about how less-profound-than-they-seem the essays are, and _you_ have read the essay(s). But, like, the essays keep popping up... why not also keep mentioning that they&#x27;re not as profound as they seem? There&#x27;s _always_ going to be someone who&#x27;s reading the essays for the first time, so why discourage folks from providing the new reader the opportunity to read valid criticism of the essays developed over the years? reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentFine, but that comment was not a proper criticism or a warning - it was a dismissal. Even having revised my opinions on pg and his writings, I find coldtea&#x27;s summary to be unfair. reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparentHow about maciej&#x27;s criticism, which is basically the same with more words (though also much funnier than mine)?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idlewords.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;04&#x2F;dabblers_and_blowhards.htm reply nickpp 1 hour agorootparentLoved that essay back in 2005, you know. PG and YC were just starting then, no? But, since then, I watched in awe what they built and how their work touches and improves my life every day.Maciej? He&#x27;s writing about how we shouldn&#x27;t go to Mars these days. He&#x27;s and excellent and very entertaining writer and I am sure he has plenty to teach me but I&#x27;d rather listen to PG. My focus is limited and I&#x27;d rather follow someone who already helped me get ahead and showed me what the possibilities truly are instead of pushing his limits onto me. replychaostheory 1 hour agorootparentprevMaybe you should ask the same question to SunghoYahng, the user who started this thread? That wasn’t very constructive either, and neither was coldtea’s response.“I read it as a warning that PG skews his arguments to prove some narrow points and you should be careful when applying them to your life, so you don&#x27;t waste years chasing improbable goals”They were being just as curt as nickpp. What they wrote was not as reasonable as your lines above, hence the response. From my pov, the main reason that you’re criticizing nickpp is because his opinion doesn’t match your own.The irony here is that I’m more sympathetic to your viewpoint, but I’ll try to be constructive beyond just calling you out:* These essays take a lot of work to write* These essays are not hidden behind a paywall* The essays capture the POV of a successful startup founder and more importantly a successful startup investor* Does the advice apply to everyone? Probably not everyone 100%. I doubt many of his essays even apply to 25% of people, or even 10% depending on the topic.* still, many people have profited off pg’s advice in some way* If you don’t like pg’s essays, you don’t have to read them* pg founded HN. Don’t be surprised to see people defending pg here. reply saberience 41 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never read any essay written by Paul Graham which had a point I hadn&#x27;t read before somewhere or else or otherwise encountered a thought of his which was was actually original or new. He just repackages general truisms, common-sense or someone else&#x27;s thought and because he&#x27;s Paul Graham it gets attention and people post his essay up on HN. That&#x27;s it. reply varjag 11 minutes agorootparentHis Plan For Spam was at the time new, original and really helped decimate email spam at the time. reply nickpp 25 minutes agorootparentprevPG&#x27;s been writing these essays long before HN or YC. Actually those essays in the beginning made him known and helped him attract the first batches of founders. Those founders (and subsequent ones) have done incredible things. They have created and added tremendous value to countless people&#x27;s life.So there is value in these essays. You don&#x27;t have to see it or appreciate it but denigrating it just turns the question on you: who are you? what have you done? what do you have to show and teach us? reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not entitled to consider that my personal life or career choices should be pushed onto others as advice.So, my ...advice is for people to follow much more timeless wisdom which has worked great for billions, and not get into the cult of some rich&#x2F;succesful or into cults of personality. reply nickpp 1 hour agorootparentFor all my life (and I am not spring chicken) I noticed one thing: criticism, cynicism and pessimism sell. They are attractive. They compel us, because they are easy and cheap. There is no cost attached in becoming a victim. No cost in saying \"that&#x27;s not for me - I can&#x27;t get it\".Optimism on the other hand and especially tech optimism is almost a slur nowadays. Very few voices support them, very few cheerleaders. And that is a shame - the whole world depends on these optimists. We need them to solve the problems facing our civilization. To have successful startups we need failed ones. Advances are not easy, they are damn hard and people willing to try are few and far in between and they need our support.And finally in the last 20 years I met and interacted with hundreds (maybe thousands) of people in our field. The ones who TRIED - few successes but zero regrets. Even failures lead to positive outcomes in the end.The only regrets and bitterness were predictably from the ones who for some reason or another were discouraged to try. They always have an excuse, some situation to point to that made them victims. But in the end it was a preexisting belief, an idea or opinion or mind virus that did the most damage to their you world-view.Very few will lose trying to emulate a successful person. None will gain anything trying to follow coldtea&#x27;s advice. replyquantified 15 hours agoprevExponential growth tends to work at the beginning of \"something\". Since the world is finite, at some point new somethings need to be created or discovered for an exponential growth, quite possibly eating the last thing that was exponentially growing at one point. So part of the trick is to be in on the exponential growth phase and sell off &#x2F; reduce exposure to the thing when that tapers off. reply chrchang523 14 hours agoparentYup, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;d consider this a \"101\" essay. The larger exponential-growth trends (e.g. Moore&#x27;s Law) practically always have a microstructure with many sigmoid curves. After you&#x27;ve encountered your first exponential, the \"201\" lesson about saturation becomes important. reply tempestn 10 hours agorootparentAnd then generally all the smaller S-curves build on each other to make a curve that looks exponential for much longer, but ultimately turns out to be a sigmoid as well. One thing I muse on occasionally is whether the same will ultimately be true for technological progress as a whole. reply jonny_eh 14 hours agoparentprevJust like how bacteria grow exponentially (as mentioned in the article), but are constrained by their petri dish or host. reply mtrimpe 14 hours agoparentprevAs they say... every exponential is a sigmoid in reality. reply esafak 14 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s when you collect your check, step off the train, and start anew.

From Mathew 25:24-27, relevant bits:\"He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘(...) I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! (...) you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.\"For that parable to be useful when it was written, common people must have understood the idea of lending your money with interest. From that, it&#x27;s not a big step for them to have figured out what happens if do it again, and again, having the interest compound.EDIT: Also, how old is that story about a smartass asking a king to give him a chessboard of grain, where on first field they have one single grain, and for every other field, 2x the amount on the previous one? reply edmundsauto 10 hours agoparentprevI think most religions, at their core, have the element of philosophy. It’s a shame it gets bundled with institutional self preservation, growth, and belief in the supernatural. Those that can separate the less good attributes end up more like Stoicism or westernized Buddhism.But there is something deeply wise in most religions that can have profound effects on how we live our lives. reply csomar 3 hours agoparentprevReligions were created by natural selection through thousands of year; and they made it through multiple empires, times and even today.

The public sector is huge and largely old fashioned heirarchical&#x2F;institutional. What is the Fortune 500, if not a big list of institutions.Read the CV of any new-minted corporate CEO almost without fail you&#x27;ll find that before leaping into the C-suite they first laboured for 15 years in one big institution, building credibility and experience.Big law firms, big financial firms, the military, academia, on and on it goes, large institutions within which career advancement depends on finding ones way through the institutional culture and comporting oneself to it, in greater and lesser ways. reply atq2119 11 hours agoparentThe key irony is that the empowerment of ambitious individuals that he praises is only possible in an institutional framework that makes it possible. That just allows you to sell your homebrew computer, for example. And there are plenty of people who, once they have become powerful by climbing those ladders, would have no qualms about pulling them up. So pg&#x27;s analysis works at an individual level, but it&#x27;s not great guidance for what society should do. reply BoiledCabbage 3 hours agorootparent> The key irony is that the empowerment of ambitious individuals that he praises is only possible in an institutional framework that makes it possible.That&#x27;s the pretty consistent blindspot I&#x27;ve found in people who strongly promote that view - they are almost always blind to the institutions that are required to support someone \"being independent\". reply MichaelZuo 12 hours agoparentprevWhich part of the essay suggests that he underestimates this? reply kevinventullo 14 hours agoparentprevNot to mention the institution of SV VC’s. reply zeckalpha 8 hours agoparentprevThis essay seems to be more about founders, not appointed CEOs. reply _3u10 11 hours agoparentprevAnd how many worked slightly less proficiently and didn’t make CEO : manager &#x2F; etc? reply tempestn 10 hours agoprevOne way to frame this that I find fascinating is that increased equality of opportunity directly leads to decreased equality of outcomes. I think we&#x27;re seeing both. While opportunity is still very unequal, it is arguably more equal than it ever has been -- both for cultural reasons, but also for technological ones, especially the internet. The combined knowledge of humanity is basically freely available to anyone with the skill to use it. Likewise it is much easier, as PG mentioned, for individuals to reach an audience, whether their field is business, art, politics, etc. As a direct result, it is easier than ever for exceptional (and&#x2F;or lucky) individuals to become exponentially more successful than others, leading to an increase in inequality of outcomes. I&#x27;ve never thought of it in those terms before, and find it really interesting, as both forms of inequality are often lumped together as issues to be solved, whereas it now seems to me they may be in direct conflict. reply hiAndrewQuinn 9 hours agoparent>The combined knowledge of humanity is basically freely available to anyone with the skill to use it.It&#x27;s fascinating how differently people react to the knowledge of this phenomenon. When I was a kid, basically as soon as I realized this was the case I started arguing with my parents that we had to have an Internet-connected computer in the house now. As soon as we got one I basically started reading Wikipedia every non-school hour of every day for 2 years straight.I doubt I remember more than 0.1% of everything I actually read from that period of my life, but it felt formative and healing in a way I just never expected to be the case. I have also never met anyone else who did something like this and it makes me sad! reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentI binged on Wikipedia too. In a way, it was the OG \"infinite content website\" way before scoundrels perfected this and made it into a business model (notifications, infinite scroll, etc.). I would search for something I needed or was curious about, read the article, find some links expanding on adjacent topics, start reading those, and suddenly it&#x27;s 2-3h hours later, I have 20+ Wikipedia tabs open, I am reading something entirely unrelated to the original topic, and I have no idea how I got there.Rinse repeat over my high school and early university years. reply foobarian 9 hours agorootparentprevCan you please think back very hard and try to remember if it&#x27;s something that you ate or drank that made you like this that I can feed to my kids :-D reply hiAndrewQuinn 8 hours agorootparentCoffee!

Banks’ Why the Culture Wins, from a couple of days ago:> The market is a good example of evolution in action; the try-everything-and-see-what-works approach. This might provide a perfectly morally satisfactory resource-management system so long as there was absolutely no question of any sentient creature ever being treated purely as one of those resources. The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is - without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset - intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.> It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] — through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others — a kind of synthetic evil.…> The Culture, of course, has gone beyond even that, to an economy so much a part of society it is hardly worthy of a separate definition, and which is limited only by imagination, philosophy (and manners), and the idea of minimally wasteful elegance; a kind of galactic ecological awareness allied to a desire to create beauty and goodness.> Whatever; in the end practice (as ever) will outshine theory.[1]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vavatch.co.uk&#x2F;books&#x2F;banks&#x2F;cultnote.htm reply kubanczyk 11 hours agoparent> the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political valuesThere&#x27;s no such elevation.

So in practice a lot of people do elevate the market over more human values, and that influences the political process and the law. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentNot to mention, economic factors are stronger than political or social factors. The market economy is winning for basic evolutionary reasons: those who engage in it are able to outcompete those who don&#x27;t, whether it&#x27;s at the \"marketplace of ideas\" or in the field of battle. And it doesn&#x27;t even matter if, at individual level, the pro-market society is worse off. Much like with hunter-gathering vs. agriculture - the former lifestyle may be better for you, but if your group doesn&#x27;t adopt the latter, it&#x27;ll eventually be conquered by a group that does.In the end, people end up elevating the market above all, whether they want it or not, because they underestimate the power of the system they&#x27;re dealing with. reply chii 5 hours agorootparentprev> the law regulates (or frees) the market.and yet, black markets exists, especially in places where the law fails to provide or provision a sufficiently free market for some goods&#x2F;services.So i would argue that the law does not decide this, or you could call it law of nature that decides it. reply RandomLensman 3 hours agorootparentEven these black markets tend to use the institutions of law and society, for example, money and they rely on the protection of law, too, i.e., law enforcement isn&#x27;t typically free to do whatever to combat them. Where enforcement is strongest, black markets have a hard time forming. reply yawnxyz 13 hours agoprevThere are tons of counter-examples to his argument — that successful organizations (and organisms) don&#x27;t require exponentially unchecked growth.

The claim was people exploit levers when they find them, I pointed to a situation were people weren&#x27;t.So in the situation in ancient Greece, if the situation was such that superlinear returns from steam power wasn&#x27;t interesting, there is already a situation where social constructs stop that \"law of nature\".And even if, hypothetically, humans were always exploiting levers, still need to show that superlinear returns are a feature of nature and cannot be blocked by any social construct (as they are not the results of rules).By the way, even your food hunting thing is incorrect as such, as humans are known to willingly starve themselves to death.The problem with broad and sweeping claims is, that they are easily debunked unless they are very carefully researched. replymistermann 11 hours agorootparentprevDid you see the unconventional events in the Middle East in the last few weeks?

In particular, this passage seems to be a pretty thinly veiled way of saying that giant corporations are a natural consequence of a healthy economy:> It&#x27;s obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we&#x27;ve invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity.It relies on a flimsy claim: this consequence is not caused by social conventions. Are not all of the examples given some manifestation of \"rules we&#x27;ve invented\"? Which of these things have any significance sans any sort of social context? reply MetalGuru 12 hours agoparentIt’s a function of power law distribution. A lot of natural phenomena follows it. reply PheonixPharts 7 hours agorootparent> it’s a function of power law distribution.People always flippantly quote this without ever looking at the distribution of the actual data.Whenever people see an uneven distribution they cite something about power laws being that natural order of things and that ends the discussion.It turns out in many, many cases (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s particular one) the observed behavior follows nothing like a power law.A good example of this is net-worth distributions. People often say \"of course there&#x27;s super rich people, that&#x27;s just a power law! It&#x27;s not concerning income inequality, it&#x27;s nature!\". But if you pull up the data and do a log-log plot you see quite clearly that it is not even close to following a power-law, and does so only at the lower 90% income quantiles. Which is funny considering the fundamental argument is that unequal distribution are natural so long as they follow a power law. reply robertlagrant 13 hours agoparentprev> It relies on a flimsy claim: this consequence is not caused by social conventionsYou&#x27;re not saying why it&#x27;s flimsy. Talking about \"social conventions\" is the wrong approach. It&#x27;s more like \"this is an outcome of dominant strategies\". Be that strategy in the time of kings and queens to become a ruler, or a powerful subject, or in the age of capitalism gaining money by offering things people want to pay for, or in socialist countries gaining power and wealth through navigating the politics of the state, or whatever it is, some people outperform others significantly.You just have to pick whether you want a mechanism that rewards creating value for others, that they will pay for, or one that rewards having the right connections, or being willing to do violence. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 12 hours agorootparentI see. My phrasing could have been better; I wasn&#x27;t sure how to express this so here&#x27;s another attempt.I do understand the observation and I don&#x27;t disagree, per se. It&#x27;s just so very noticeable that the observation is made by a person who has greatly benefited from its effects. It&#x27;s then more than a little distasteful from my perspective that this person is asserting that this is \"a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we&#x27;ve invented\".Again, strictly speaking the observed effect is not a construct of human society; a wild cat who steals food from another wild cat is the one who gets to survive that day. But it&#x27;s hard to look past who is writing this and for what audience.To clarify, the \"It\" in my sentence is referring to \"a pretty thinly veiled way of saying that giant corporations are a natural consequence of a healthy economy\". I won&#x27;t object to \"natural\", as the essay makes a compelling point, but \"healthy\" was hardly mentioned and certainly not by name. Indeed, \"healthy\" was dismissed as irrelevant by the passage I quoted. reply gknoy 11 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s just so very noticeable that the observation is made by a person who has greatly benefited from its effectsYou&#x27;ll likely notice the same about most of PG&#x27;s essays. Of course he&#x27;s biased -- but most of the readers here already know this, and are not surprised to see a startup-favoring lens being used in much of his writings. His essays still get a lot of traction here, specifically because this started as a discussion board for his startup incubator, and because his essays about How To Startup &#x2F; What Is a Startup are fairly commonly read in this space (or were what we read when we first discovered this space?). reply AlchemistCamp 10 hours agorootparentThis understates the case. PG’s essays predated the creation of YC and this “space” (as in this forum called HN) was first coded and moderated by PG.Obviously many others played crucial roles, but literally none of this would be here without PG’s ideas. The fact that it is and we’re discussing how his ideas may describe effects he’s benefited from only makes them more compelling, IMO. reply jay_kyburz 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think you need to read between the lines.I agree with this statement \"superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we&#x27;ve invented\", but I disagree its not a problem with capitalism. Its _THE_ problem with capitalism.The good part of capitalism is that people are rewarded for their effort, the bad part is that those rewards tend to coalesce into a very small subset of people. Winning compounds.We impose some rules to claw back some money so we can build a safe, stable society. (tax) The problem is, if you are already winning, you are not incentivized to change the system. (pay more tax). Whats more, winners have a lot of power to control how people think and act. We have some other rules to try and limit the power of winners, but those rules are under constant attack. reply robertlagrant 2 hours agorootparent> The good part of capitalism is that people are rewarded for their effortWell. They&#x27;re rewarded for value provided, not effort invested. I don&#x27;t care if you worked really hard on it, I&#x27;m not buying your $50 fizzy drink. I want the one that took less effort (and thus cost less) but still was a good product.> the bad part is that those rewards tend to coalesce into a very small subset of people. Winning compounds.This isn&#x27;t exactly true. Rewards work in different ways. If people want steady, mostly-guaranteed income, they (e.g. me) get a day job with a salary. If they want a shot at doing really well, they do a risky thing and, often, it doesn&#x27;t work. For the few people it does for, you still wouldn&#x27;t call most of them highly rewarded. A restaurant owner might well still do worse than a salaried Silicon Valley developer. But still, for the industry, you take a risk to get big payoffs.Also, \"reward\" is a poor lens to look at this through, as it&#x27;s slightly infantilising. It&#x27;s not a pat on the head for a job well done. It&#x27;s an exchange of value between adults. Steve Jobs did very well financially with the release of the iPhone. But the only reason he did so is because millions of people got value added to their lives through owning an iPhone. They got value far above what they had before, for a price they would pay.The problem is with looking at only the successful people as examples of the overall system. The system rewards value. If you happen, through hard work, connections, innate abilities, and a bit of luck, to provide value to other people, you do well. If what you do scales to provide value to millions of people, you do really well.> Whats more, winners have a lot of power to control how people think and act.I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. No one is controlling thoughts and actions. You might say that people who own news outlets have this power, although ownership conveys less control than you might think, but this is a very specific industry. And people who control vast investment sums get to set criteria for companies to fall in line with. But both of those are under fire for this reason: money shouldn&#x27;t translate into power over people&#x27;s thoughts or actions. However, in the normal success case, e.g. if I own a restaurant chain, I do really well, but I don&#x27;t really control anything. replyRIMR 12 hours agoprevnext [7 more] [flagged] TacticalCoder 9 hours agoparent> I block all HTTP sites, and his HTTPs site has some sort of misconfigured *.store.turbify.com cert on itI&#x27;ve got the same issue.

As the production of real things made of atoms can&#x27;t be ramped up arbitrarily quickly.For example, every doubling of oil production after WW1 took more than a decade to accomplish. And oil men were pretty well known for risk taking boldness.The physical impossibility of real resource inputs to human civilization doubling on an even faster timeline is so obvious that I skipped pointing it out, and got straight to the point.That it&#x27;s incredibly unlikely for even money to double quickly enough. reply yawnxyz 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m still surprised by most of my tech&#x2F;design&#x2F;startup friends who don&#x27;t want or like using GPT-4 to get work done or even for small stuff like cooking and planning.

Several months after Feynman’s death, while working on what would become Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman (public library) — the masterly biography plumbing the wellspring of Feynman’s genius — James Gleick discovered something of arresting strangeness and splendor. “My heart stopped,” Gleick tells me. “I have never had an experience like that as a biographer, before or since.” In a mass of unread papers sent to him by Feynman’s widow, Gweneth, Gleick found a letter that discomposed his most central understanding of Feynman’s character. A generation after computing pioneer Alan Turing tussled with the binary code of body and spirit in the wake of loss, Feynman — a scientist perhaps uncommonly romantic yet resolutely rational and unsentimental in his reverence for the indomitable laws of physics that tend toward decay — penned a remarkable letter to a physical nonentity that was, for the future Nobel-winning physicist, the locus of an irrepressible metaphysical reality. Richard Feynman as a youth In high school, the teenage Richard spent summers at the beach in his native Far Rockaway. There, he grew besotted with a striking girl named Arline — a girl he knew he would marry. Both complement and counterpoint to his own nature, Arline met Richard’s inclination for science with ardor for philosophy and art. (The art class he took just to be near her would lay the foundation for his little-known, lifelong passion for drawing.) By his junior year, Richard proposed. Arline accepted. With the eyes of young love, they peered into a shared future of infinite possibility for bliss. Richard and Arline, 1940s But they were abruptly grounded when a mysterious malady began afflicting Arline with inexplicable symptoms — a lump would appear and disappear on her neck, fevers would roil over her with no apparent cause. Eventually, she was hospitalized for what was believed to be typhoid. Gleick writes: Feynman began to glimpse the special powerlessness that medical uncertainty can inflict on a scientific person. He had come to believe that the scientific way of thinking brought a measure of calmness and control in difficult situations — but not now. Just as Feynman began bombarding the doctors with questions that steered them toward a closer approximation of the scientific method, Arline began to recover just as mysteriously and unpredictably as she had fallen ill. But the respite was only temporary. The symptoms returned, still shorn of a concrete explanation but now unambiguously pointing toward the terminal — a prognosis Arline’s doctors kept from her. Richard refused to go along with the deception — he and Arline had promised each other to face life with unremitting truthfulness — but he was forced to calibrate his commitment to circumstance. Gleick writes: His parents, Arline’s parents, and the doctors all urged him not to be so cruel as to tell a young woman she was dying. His sister, Joan, sobbing, told him he was stubborn and heartless. He broke down and bowed to tradition. In her room at Farmingdale Hospital, with her parents at her side, he confirmed that she had glandular fever. Meanwhile, he started carrying around a letter — a “goodbye love letter,” as he called it — that he planned to give her when she discovered the truth. He was sure she would never forgive the unforgivable lie. He did not have long to wait. Soon after Arline returned home from the hospital she crept to the top of the stairs and overheard her mother weeping with a neighbor down in the kitchen. When she confronted Richard — his letter snug in his pocket — he told her the truth, handed her the letter, and asked her to marry him. Arline and Richard, 1940s Marriage, however, proved to be a towering practical problem — Princeton, where Feynman was now pursuing a Ph.D., threatened to withdraw the fellowships funding his graduate studies if he were to wed, for the university considered the emotional and pragmatic responsibilities of marriage a grave threat to academic discipline. Just as Feynman began considering leaving Princeton, a diagnosis detonated the situation — Arline had contracted a rare form of tuberculosis, most likely from unpasteurized milk. At first, Feynman was relieved that the grim alternative options of Hodgkin’s disease and incurable cancers like lymphoma had been ruled out. But he was underestimating, or perhaps misunderstanding, the gravity of tuberculosis — the very disease which had taken the love of Alan Turing’s life and which, during its two-century heyday, had claimed more lives around the globe than any other malady and all wars combined. At the time of Arline’s diagnosis in 1941, immunology was in its infancy, the antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections practically nonexistent, and the first successful medical application of penicillin a year away. Tuberculosis was a death sentence, even if it was a slow death with intervals of remission — a fact Richard and Arline faced with an ambivalent mix of brave lucidity and hope against hope. Meanwhile, Richard’s parents met the prospect of his marriage with bristling dread. His mother, who believed he was marrying Arline out of pity rather than love, admonished him that he would be putting his health and his very life in danger, and coldly worried about how the stigma attached to tuberculosis would impact her brilliant young son’s reputation. “I was surprised to learn such a marriage is not unlawful,” she scoffed unfeelingly. “It ought to be.” But Richard was buoyed by love — a love so large and luminous that he found himself singing aloud one day as he was arranging Arline’s transfer to a sanatorium. Determined to go through with the wedding, he wrote to his beloved: I guess maybe it is like rolling off of a log — my heart is filled again & I’m choked with emotions — and love is so good & powerful — it’s worth preserving — I know nothing can separate us — we’ve stood the tests of time and our love is as glorious now as the day it was born — dearest riches have never made people great but love does it every day — we’re not little people — we’re giants … I know we both have a future ahead of us — with a world of happiness — now & forever. On June 29, 1942, they promised each other eternity. Richard and Arline on their wedding day Gleick writes: He borrowed a station wagon from a Princeton friend, outfitted it with mattresses for the journey, and picked up Arline in Cedarhurst. She walked down her father’s hand-poured concrete driveway wearing a white dress. They crossed New York Harbor on the Staten Island ferry — their honeymoon ship. They married in a city office on Staten Island, in the presence of neither family nor friends, their only witnesses two strangers called in from the next room. Fearful of contagion, Richard did not kiss her on the lips. After the ceremony he helped her slowly down the stairs, and onward they drove to Arline’s new home, a charity hospital in Browns Mills, New Jersey. Meanwhile, WWII was reaching its crescendo of destruction, dragging America into the belly of death with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Now one of the nation’s most promising physicists, Feynman was recruited to work on what would become the Manhattan Project and soon joined the secret laboratory in Los Alamos. Feynman’s Los Alamos badge Arline entered the nearby Albuquerque sanatorium, from where she wrote him letters in code — for the sheer fun of it, because she knew how he cherished puzzles, but the correspondence alarmed the military censors at the laboratory’s Intelligence Office. Tasked with abating any breaches to the secrecy of the operation, they cautioned Feynman that coded messages were against the rules and demanded that his wife include a key in each letter to help them decipher it. This only amplified Arline’s sense of fun — she began cutting holes into her letters, covering passages with ink, and even mail-ordered a jigsaw puzzle kit with which to cut up the pages and completely confound the agents. But the levity masked the underlying darkness which Richard and Arline tried so desperately to evade — Arline was dying. As her body failed, he steadied himself to her spirit: You are a strong and beautiful woman. You are not always as strong as other times but it rises & falls like the flow of a mountain stream. I feel I am a reservoir for your strength — without you I would be empty and weak… I find it much harder these days to write these things to you. In every single letter, he told her that he loved her. “I have a serious affliction: loving you forever,” he wrote. Richard and Arline at the Albuquerque sanatorium In early 1945, two and a half years into their marriage, Richard and Arline made love for the first time. He had been too afraid of harming her frail health somehow, she too afraid of infecting him with the deadly bacterium consuming her. But Arline insisted that this pent up desire could no longer be contained and assured Richard that this would only bring them closer — to each other, and to the life they had so lovingly dreamt up for themselves: I’ll always be your sweetheart & first love — besides a devoted wife — we’ll be proud parents too… I am proud of you always Richard –[you are] a good husband, and lover, & well, coach, I’ll show you what I mean Sunday. But heightened as their hopes were by this new dimension of shared experience, Arline’s health continued to plummet. Her weight dropped to eighty-four pounds. Exasperated by the helplessness of medicine, which Feynman had come to see not as a manifestation but as a mutilation of the scientific method, he invested all hope in an experimental drug made of mold growths. “Keep hanging on,” he exhorted Arline. “Nothing is certain. We lead a charmed life.” She began spitting blood. At twenty-seven, on the precipice of a brilliant scientific career, he was terminally in love. On June 16, 1945, while working at the computing room at Los Alamos, Feynman received a call from the sanatorium that Arline was dying. He borrowed a colleague’s car and sped to the hospital, where he found her immobile, her eyes barely tracing his movement. Early in his scientific career, he had been animated by the nature of time. Now, hours stretched and contracted as he sat at her deathbed, until one last small breath tolled the end at 9:21PM. The wake of loss has a way of tranquilizing grief with the pressing demands of practical arrangements — a tranquilizer we take willingly, almost gratefully. The following morning, Feynman arranged for his beloved’s cremation, methodically collected her personal belongings, and on the final page of the small spiral notebook in which she recorded her symptoms he wrote with scientific remove: “June 16 — Death.” And so we arrive at Gleick’s improbable discovery in that box of letters — improbable because of the extreme rationality with which Feynman hedged against even the slightest intimation of metaphysical conjectures untestable by science and unprovable by reason. During his courtship of Arline, he had been vexed by her enthusiasm for Descartes, whose “proof” of God’s perfection he found intellectually lazy and unbefitting of Descartes’s reputation as a champion of reason. He had impishly countered Arline’s insistence that there are two sides to everything by cutting a piece of paper and half-twisting it into a Möbius strip, the ends pasted together to render a surface with just one side. Everything that appeared mystical, Feynman believed, was simply an insufficiently explained mystery with a physical answer not yet found. Even Arline’s dying hour had offered testing ground for conviction. Puzzlingly, the clock in the room had stopped at exactly 9:21PM — the time of death. Aware of how this bizarre occurrence could foment the mystical imagination in unscientific minds, Feynman reasoned for an explanation. Remembering that he had repaired the clock multiple times over the course of Arline’s stay at the sanatorium, he realized that the instrument’s unwieldy mechanism must have choked when the nurse picked it up in the low evening light to see and record the time. How astonishing and how touchingly human, then, that Feynman penned the letter Gleick found in the box forty-two years later — a letter he wrote to Arline in October of 1946, 488 days after her death: D’Arline, I adore you, sweetheart. I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you. It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing. But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you. I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures. When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive. I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real. My darling wife, I do adore you. I love my wife. My wife is dead. Rich. And then, with the sole defibrillator for heartache we have — humor — Feynman adds: PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address.

I was curious how much of the book would be this, considering I know she died of TB, so I flipped ahead and saw a letter to her quite a few more pages in, so I figured she must survive until at least that point. I continued reading and was emotionally caught off guard when she died only a couple of pages later. I&#x27;m not sure why I was so distraught at the death of someone I did not know who died 80 years ago, but I was looking forward to, and had the expectation of, a few more cute letters between them.When I got to the letter that I had originally flipped to, it was the one he was writing after her death as a form of therapy to himself.FWIW, they had a very cute relationship and the letters are worth reading for that alone. reply Gabriel54 18 hours agoprevVery touching story.> PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address.Not out of character for how I always imagined his personality. reply functoid 16 hours agoprev> Marriage, however, proved to be a towering practical problem — Princeton, where Feynman was now pursuing a Ph.D., threatened to withdraw the fellowships funding his graduate studies if he were to wed, for the university considered the emotional and pragmatic responsibilities of marriage a grave threat to academic discipline.You have got to be kidding me.

There is no reason to be judgemental about this in the absence of other information. reply TaylorAlexander 15 hours agorootparentI’m polyamorous. Being poly involves clear communication and consent of all parties involved. It involves respect for the other people. If Feynman was sleeping with his students wives and openly denigrating women, that sounds much more like the behavior of someone cheating than the behavior of someone practicing ethical non monogamy. Remember that back then, ethical non monogamy was much less common. The foundational books on the subject came out in the late 1990’s or after, and before that people didn’t even have the language to describe and negotiate what they were doing. It was much more common for one person inclined to this behavior to just cheat.Feynman has been a huge influence on me. His outlook on science and the world helped shape my own. But we can’t ignore the flaws of our heroes, and it really sounds like he had a dark side. reply distant_hat 15 hours agorootparentWhere are the flaws? That the guy was attractive and managed to seduce others? He may have gone with other people&#x27;s wives but that is on the wife to say no, not on him. reply TaylorAlexander 14 hours agorootparentEthical non monogamy requires ethical behavior. If you’re seeking out students wives, that is predatory and unethical behavior. If you’re also denigrating women that is unethical behavior. While it’s possible that Feynman, the students, the students wives, and Feynman’s wife all consented to this behavior, it seems unlikely.I do not believe “that is on the wife to say no, not on him”. If these allegations are true, he was a teacher engaging in predatory behavior. That is simply unethical due to the power imbalance. And the fact that he was asking people to cheat is unethical. reply ilc 14 hours agorootparentprevIf he knew the woman was married, he shares in that blame.

Were these two distinct phases of his life? reply happytoexplain 20 hours agoparentThis is a good summary example of something I find distinctly dangerous about the way people think of figures they don&#x27;t personally know (i.e. how people on the social web treat public figures, or even just any stranger they see on the web). We see snapshots and assemble a person in our head. We can barely do that with any degree of fidelity regarding people we personally know, much less public figures.People do good and evil things. But a person, in virtually all cases, is not \"good\" or \"evil\". Even if Feynman was engaging in the two behaviors you are thinking of at the same time (whatever those behaviors are - I&#x27;m not commenting), it still doesn&#x27;t make him some kind of paradox. It does so much damage to think like this. This false dichotomy is especially prevalent for sexual topics, because they trigger stronger emotions and push us towards our \"that guy good, that guy bad\" instincts. reply the_af 19 hours agorootparentIn addition to your comment, what I find mind-boggling is how easily people swing between the two extremes of opinion: it seems every public figure must either be adored and admired, or reviled and ostracized. People (myself included, I don&#x27;t exclude myself from being human!) do not want to contemplate public figures as complex individuals with dark and bright aspects. It&#x27;s always all or nothing.So Woody Allen went from being an adored auteur to someone who not only was declared guilty of a horrible crime in public opinion, but also people felt entitled to declare his cinema was never good to begin with (where were these people before Allen fell in disgrace?

I acknowledge it was however a very uncomfortable experience for young women who got to meet him face to face (or hand to butt, I suppose), which is unfortunate. I also see how his behavior would have discouraged women who wanted to write and would have sought his mentorship; that is truly unfortunate.I wish he hadn&#x27;t behaved like this, but this doesn&#x27;t define Asimov.

Finding out he was a sex pest or womanizer or worse has tangible consequences to that role. Was he a good mentor in general, or only to women he wanted to fuck? Or only ones he didn&#x27;t? Were there any women pushed out of science because of his inappropriate attention or advances? We now have to ask these questions, and their answers can retroactively change how we evaluate his later life&#x27;s work as an advocate of science.Similarly woody allen makes movies that are compelling because of their portrayal of human connection and vulnerability. As you said, what woody allen is accused of is a great crime, far far beyond routine human flaws. It does change the context and the meaning of the movie to know that this is what its creator thinks of human connection as well. You can decide not to believe the allegations, but for people who do believe them I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an error or transgression for them to evaluate his movies in light of them.And it is certainly not true that no one criticized these figures before their \"faults\" were known. Orson Welles famously with woody allen, Picasso was not always revered, and I disliked feynman from reading his own memoirs. It&#x27;s just these criticisms are not generally welcomed or amplified for figures in the prime of their accolades. Which is an interesting subject itself, I think. reply the_af 19 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s just these criticisms are not generally welcomed or amplified for figures in the prime of their accolades. Which is an interesting subject itself, I think.Yes, this is a fair assessment. The criticisms are given voice and spread once the person falls in disgrace. They are sometimes declared \"unpersons\", which I find deeply irritating. I suppose this happens to artists or scientists nearer in time; nobody cares to censor&#x2F;cancel a Greek philosopher if he abused boys, it&#x27;s just a footnote in their biography. reply monknomo 19 hours agorootparentIt might be different if you could go talk to the boys - with these modern folks you can often literally interview the victim(s) and I think that makes a difference for the reaction reply the_af 13 hours agorootparentYes, this is a good point. Talking to victims or aggrieved parties is something ancient history denies us.On the other hand, what if we could -- would we cancel all those Greek philosophers, or artists and scientists of antiquity? Strike them from the classroom, or focus the lesson entirely on how bad they were as people? Would mankind be better if that were the case? reply watwut 18 hours agorootparentprevThen again, plenty of times they are not declared unpersons nor treated horribly. Oftentimes just mentioning that this or that person did something bad at some points is enough for everyone to get outrage over \"how dare you to say that\".As in, criticism is silenced until it breaks. reply the_af 18 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s just these criticisms are not generally welcomed or amplified for figures in the prime of their accolades. Which is an interesting subject itself, I think.I want to make clear that when someone commits a horrible crime (not a minor transgression) they should be held accountable. So rape&#x2F;abuse&#x2F;murder is horrible, being a bad husband&#x2F;wife or an uncaring parent is bad but not \"horrible\", etc. Also, people are flawed, and everyone engages in bad behavior that wouldn&#x27;t stand up to public criticism. Your mileage may vary, of course.What I object to is canceling a person&#x27;s work because of alleged crimes. People confuse \"I don&#x27;t like what it&#x27;s alleged this person did in their personal life\" with \"this is not relevant art&#x2F;science, I wish cinemas&#x2F;schools&#x2F;museums didn&#x27;t mention this person anymore\". reply watwut 18 hours agorootparentSaying he did X is not the same as cancelation. Also, if actual art piece is related to the real world acts, it is entirely fair to talk about it. Just like when we talk about political purposes of art.There is also difference between \"not mentioning person existed\" and refusal to celebrate that person as hero or moral founder. Or just, putting contemporary complains about historical character into context. The \"do not mention this person\" is quite rare, actually. What people object about regarding cancelation is adding shade of grade to the person story or refusal to celebrate them. reply the_af 18 hours agorootparent> Saying he did X is not the same as cancelationCinema students are literally asking teachers not to include Woody Allen in their syllabus.

People seem to want to do this. Everyone must be either a hero or a villain; and a hero who falls from grace and turns into a villain in the public eye is doubly reviled!It&#x27;s fascinating but also irritating how we are so eager to create gods and then destroy them. replyKMag 18 hours agorootparentprev\"But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.\" -- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago reply noobface 19 hours agorootparentprevThe topic here specifically is his love life.

In fact, it&#x27;s arguably better to use a \"worse\" example, by your definition, since it actually challenges the reader to consider the point more carefully. If the subject&#x27;s crimes are petty, the reader might accidentally ignore my point, instead just jumping to the easy and fallacious thought, \"yeah I agree, that person didn&#x27;t do anything terrible\", and moving on.That said, to be clear, I don&#x27;t have an opinion on where Feynman&#x27;s indiscretions fall on the spectrum.

The word brings to mind a one-dimensional scale. That is a measly one-step-up from black-and-white. The implication of a \"gradient\" is that there is \"good\" on one side and \"evil\" on the other, and everybody falls somewhere on the gradient. This is not strictly false in all senses, but it is almost always a gross oversimplification and, effectively, a useless measure. A core part of my point is multi-dimensionality. reply UniverseHacker 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat is he accused of? reply avgcorrection 18 hours agorootparentprevHow about we do away with speculating on the personal lives of public figures unless it is pertinent to some issue?

Pervert, philanderer womanizer, consummate cheater.... Let&#x27;s use existing words that lead to the correct assumptions by those unfamiliar with his sexual behaviors.A sexual predator evokes Harvey Weinstein. AFAIK, Feynman sounds more like an 80s rock-star, and all the positive + negative behaviors associated with that stereotype. reply mherkender 18 hours agorootparentI dunno, a lot of those 80s rock stars slept with their underage groupies. Harvey Weinstein used his power to pressure young Hollywood actresses, am I supposed to believe that a professor sleeping with his students is a completely different beast?I still think Harvey Weinstein is worse, like you say, but I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to pretend like they&#x27;re completely different types of people. reply watwut 18 hours agorootparentThere is actual difference between threatening people livelihood and actually destroying peoples careers forever and actually using violence. Which afaik, Feynman is not accused of. He did misrepresented who he was in some of those relationships - by pretending he is undergraduate. That is exact opposite of using power, it is pretending you do not have it.Those are completely different types of people. It is not that professors should sleep with students, it is that Weinstein went far far beyond that.

Even Garrison Keillor, as mild mannered as they come, got taken down for it.We are simultaneously told that women are equal to men, and yet we also are told there are male predators and womanizers who women need special protection against.This dismisses women&#x27;s sexual agency. Specifically that women may choose, consciously, to exploit their sexual attractiveness to get something from a man.If women don&#x27;t have agency, i.e. men can manipulate them into damaging sexual relationships which they are helpless to avoid, this posits women as less than equals to men, as men are expected to stand up for themselves when someone attempts to manipulate them. reply poszlem 18 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s really disappointing to see such a blatant attempt to drag someone&#x27;s name through the mud.
