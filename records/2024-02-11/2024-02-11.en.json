Now a court has ruled that Amazon committed illegal union busting. Malinowska tells Jacobin why Amazon is so afraid of its workers organizing.

The Essential Guide to Jacobin Editors The Verdict on Henry Kissinger René Rojas Bhaskar Sunkara Jonah Walters Cori Bush: Why I’m Calling for a Cease-Fire in Gaza Cori Bush There Was an Iron Wall in Gaza Seth Ackerman Interview by Caspar Shaller Two years ago, union organizer Magda Malinowska was fired from her job at an Amazon warehouse near Poznań, in western Poland. Her sacking came as retaliation for her efforts to speak out against poor working conditions — a conflict catalyzed by the September 2021 death of forty-nine-year-old Dariusz Dziamski, a colleague of hers who died on the shop floor. Fast forward to October 2023, and a Polish court has ruled that Amazon fired Malinowska illegally. The ruling provides a small step toward justice for Malinowska, albeit only after a two-year delay, and a period in which many aspects of Amazon workers’ rights have worsened. In an interview, Malinowska spoke to Jacobin’s Caspar Shaller about Amazon’s inhumane treatment of staff, its violation of basic union rights, and workers’ efforts to stand up against corporate tyranny. Caspar Shaller A court has decided that Amazon fired you illegally and reinstated your job … Magda Malinowska … but they still have three weeks to appeal. I assume they will. Caspar Shaller What was the judge’s reasoning? Magda Malinowska That was the most interesting part: it was actually pretty clear that Amazon violated union rights. So, from a formal, legal perspective it was clear that I should win the case. In Poland, however, it is possible to win the case, but without reinstatement. Some judges believe that if there is a major conflict between the trade unionists and the company it will be better this way. I was afraid that I would win the case but would not be reinstated — all the more so because the judge called more witnesses and delved deeply into the case and the relationship between the union and Amazon. The HR employees who fired me were questioned twice. Finally, the judge stated that my dismissal could have been caused by my activity. What I was accused of in terminating the contract was not proven during the case. Amazon didn’t manage to provide any evidence to support their position. Caspar Shaller What was the reason Amazon gave for firing you? Magda Malinowska They fired me for allegedly taking pictures or videos — but they didn’t know, because no one saw it — when the body of Dariusz, a colleague of mine who had died during his shift, was moved to the hearse, which they considered inconsistent with their values and social standards. Caspar Shaller How did Dariusz die? Magda Malinowska Dariusz had all the signs of experiencing a heart attack, but apparently that was not the medical reason. His wife told me his heart was broken. That’s why this was such an important case for us. Dariusz worked so hard. His job used to be done by a few people during a shift, but then they made him do all that work alone, pushing around trolleys with heavy boxes. Dariusz had been complaining that his job was too exhausting for him and he wanted a different task. But they wouldn’t give him another position. They did the exact opposite: they reduced the number of people working the same job, so his work got even more exhausting. Before Dariusz died, we’d long been trying to get Amazon to carefully examine energy expenditure and how hard the work we do is, including Dariusz’s. The company is required to do so by law. However, Amazon only roughly estimates how much energy workers put in, and doesn’t use an appropriate method to calculate it. A few years ago, we managed to persuade the Labor Inspectorate and CIOP (Central Institute for Labor Protection) to investigate the cases of several employees; some of them were putting in up to twice as much as the allowed levels. We have court judgments that say that Amazon does not examine this properly. But this is dangerous, especially as each of us has some health issues, and some of us have been doing hard physical work for years. After Dariusz’s death, I told the media that [this past dispute] was probably the real reason for my dismissal. On the Sunday before Dariusz died, he asked the supervisor to transfer him to another department because he was fed up with working too hard. Despite the requests, he continued to work alone at his post for about five hours. The next morning Dariusz collapsed and died on the floor of the warehouse. They didn’t really help him, despite his symptoms. He was told to go through the warehouse — the size of a dozen or so soccer fields — on his own, to go down the stairs to the medical room. When he got there, he died. Caspar Shaller Does this kind of thing happen a lot? Are there a lot of people who die in Amazon warehouses? Magda Malinowska It’s not like a construction site or a mine, where workers die all the time or have severe accidents. Amazon management actually gets pretty angry when there’s an accident. The work is dangerous in another way: the repetition and the strain get to you. That does affect your body and your health. That’s why we want to be able to do a labor inspection, to see if someone’s health is being affected by their work. And we want to change the definition of a workplace accident. Because if you do a super heavy job for some time and then you get a heart attack, formally it’s not connected to the job. Caspar Shaller Amazon is known for spearheading new types of labor surveillance. How is that connected to this case? Magda Malinowska One reason for the surveillance is that Amazon is trying to optimize all steps of the work process. They are not the only ones to try out new forms of labor management, but they are very quick at implementing changes. They are constantly implementing new ways of controlling workers’ bodies and movements. You can’t even leave your workstation for more than three minutes. You have scanners and cameras everywhere checking on your every movement. So, surveillance is really the big issue at Amazon. Through all this, they force you to do very simple movements in a very repetitive way. Because they broke down the labor process into these simple movements, they can easily exchange workers, they don’t need experienced workers, they can just train new ones to do these simple movements. But having to do the same movements over and over and faster and faster is totally destroying our bodies. Caspar Shaller What are you going to do, now that you can go back to the warehouse? Magda Malinowska Well, for me, this is a completely new situation. I’ve never been fired and then reinstated. It’s going to be interesting what Amazon will do now. And I’m wondering if, after this ruling and the explanation that the judge gave us, they will be willing to change their relationship with us on the union side. That is actually what the judge said: that there is a conflict between labor and employer, but the conflict cannot be an argument to dismiss union members. Firing all union members would mean there’s no union in the workplace anymore, but Polish law guarantees the right to a union. The juge even said she can see that Amazon’s attitude toward unions is very negative. It’s a global problem with Amazon: they don’t want to recognize unions anywhere. So, I think it was very important that this judge confirms what we’ve been saying, someone who’s not like us — some militant activist, who’s always up for a fight — but a representative of the state. Caspar Shaller Do you think this ruling will change anything in the immediate future? Magda Malinowska Unfortunately, I’m afraid they will not change their policy. They behave like they’re not scared of anything and try to break as many rules and regulations as possible. They’re just smashing everything on their way to making more and more profit. They’re always checking how far they can go, until finally there will be nothing left that can stop them. So this small victory is a step toward stoping them. Amazon has used Poland as a base from which to attack German unions right next door, either by importing Polish workers as strikebreakers when German warehouses were being picketed or then by simply building warehouses along the German-Polish border to serve the German market and get around German labor laws and unions. Caspar Shaller How can workers cooperate over national lines and stop multinationals from playing workers off each other? Magda Malinowska The current situation is amazing for Amazon. There are so many different legal systems, even within Germany for example, different regions have different regulations. So they try to use it against us and to make bigger profits, pay less taxes, and so on. They move orders from one warehouse to another warehouse, if there is slack in one location – or when we’re organizing a blockade, for example for our campaign “Make Amazon Pay.” When the Polish warehouses were opened, German workers were on strike, and the Amazon moved orders from German warehouses to Polish warehouses, forcing people Polish to work longer shifts. When Polish workers heard about the reason why they had to work longer shifts, they said, hey we don’t want to be scabs, and organized a go-slow. That was the beginning of our cooperation with German workers. Caspar Shaller How has organizing workers made progress over the recent years? Magda Malinowska Unfortunately, it’s become more difficult to organize. I think people are more scared. After previous actions, some people got fired. And there’s been a shift in company policy. When Amazon started out in Poland, they hired people on permanent contracts. That gave people a feeling of stability and legal protection, which allowed them to fight back. But now, there are a lot of people who are employed by agencies. The split among the workers is pretty bad. I’ve seen discussions online about how only certain types of workers are allowed to do overtime. Pay is so low that everyone wants to pick up more shifts, so weirdly being allowed to work even more becomes a matter of prestige. So, working overtime isn’t a penalty, it’s a prize. That situation is totally sick. Caspar Shaller What are you doing to change that? Magda Malinowska Last year, we started a campaign about the firing of shop stewards and union representatives. Indeed, I wasn’t the only one who was sacked, there were others, too. And together with other unions, we organized a huge campaign to change the law. And it was successful: the government changed the law. Since the law came into effect in September it’s basically pointless to fire union officials. It’s still happening illegally, of course, but maybe it changes workers’ mentality a bit to know they have more legal rights. Maybe unions will get a little bit stronger. Or at least there won’t be a repetition of 2021 when so many people were sacked out of the blue. Recently there was an election and the far-right government lost. So maybe there might be some change in how the state handles these cases. But we are not focused only on the law, we’re also trying to figure out how to strengthen our position in warehouses. And we will continue to educate workers and exchange ideas and experiences among people from my union and others. One important focus will be on inspecting labor standards and how workers can do that themselves. We will try to use health and safety as tool to make working conditions better.

Didn't expect this to happen in any European countries the least in Poland where they have strong unions. Retaliation is pretty common in the US - I announced to HR that my wife is expecting (Tue) and was fired on Friday. reply SoftTalker 17 hours agoparentSounds like an FMLA violation. Did you specifically say you would be taking leave? Not already on a \"performance improvement\" plan of any sort? Was anyone else let go on Friday? I don't know how hard this sort of thing is to litigate, \"at will\" employment covers a lot of abuses, and honestly why would you want to stay at an employer who treats you like this? Probably best to spend your energy finding a new job. Edit to add: You could report this to the Department of Labor. Not sure you'd personally get any restitution but if your employer was willing to do this kind of thing, you are probably not the only one they have screwed over. If an employer has a record of complaints they might get audited which could cost them a lot in penalties if they are violating the law. reply maire 17 hours agorootparentFMLA only covers companies with 50 or more employees. A friend was fired in the US when she told her boss she was pregnant and discovered this limitation. Her previous work experience was in France so she did not realize this could happen. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentIn CA, it’s any employer with 5 employees, thanks to the CFRA. https://www.rigginslaw.com/cfra-vs-fmla-difference-between-c.... CA really is by far one of the most employee-friendly states, on nearly every issue. reply berniedurfee 10 hours agorootparentAnd thank you! Many companies follow CA regulations by default if they do significant business in the state or have even a small footprint there. reply tnmom 16 hours agorootparentprevExcept taxes. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentDno. The roads here are way better than other places with lower taxes, it’s beautiful, the air and water are clean, and so on. Everywhere has plenty of things to complain about. I’d like to spend less in taxes, always. But at least it does feel, objectively, like we live in a mostly lovely place that actually does protect employees, have access to great healthcare, great roads, great charging infrastructure (relative to the rest of the US) and so on. reply ensignavenger 16 hours agorootparentAnecdotal, but I have driven across a majority of US states, from Florida to Alaska (and also, on both the East and West sides of Canada) and haven't noticed any strong correlation between the quality of the roads and how high a states taxes are. reply jmknoll 15 hours agorootparentThere's probably a lot of noise in the data. Off the top of my head, climate (whether roads are exposed to freeze-thaw cycles) and population density/clustering (how many miles of road do you need to maintain per person), are probably more strongly correlated with quality than taxation levels. reply smokeydoe 15 hours agorootparentprevDid you drive between Texas - Louisiana? It is a massive difference almost immediately. You go from 55mph top speed limit with many potholes in LA to smooth 75mph Texas roads. Texas roads are much better and I have heard the same opinion many times from people making that drive. Louisiana makes their roads cheaper by making them much more thin, and they don’t get repaired often in rural areas. reply simfree 13 hours agorootparentIs that why Texas property taxes are eye wateringly high? reply seanmcdirmid 16 hours agorootparentprevSince you mentioned Florida, the roads go from good to bad as soon as you cross the border into Alabama, which is a really interesting experience on the interstate. But yes, the roads are bad in Deep South states, although the taxes aren’t really that low either (just people don’t make much money to get much out of them). reply erickhill 15 hours agorootparentExcept in Texas. For a state that often bemoans the federal government and its out of control spending, Texas takes an impressive amount of funds and puts it into a very high-quality and modern interstate system. Texas will receive over $27 billion (with a B) over the next ~5 years in federal funding for highways and bridges alone. $10 billion was allocated across 2022-2023. Many of their roads are quite nice and only going to improve. Thanks, Uncle Sam! reply CydeWeys 15 hours agorootparentTexas has high property taxes. It's actually not a low tax state as measured by overall tax burden. Texas is also very proud of its massive, well-resourced public schools (and their football teams!), and pours a lot of tax revenue into them. reply lobocinza 13 hours agorootparentWorse than California? reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentIt depends on your income since income taxation in California is extremely graduated. If you make less than $60-70k, you’ll pay less in CA, otherwise you’ll do better in TX. reply reaperducer 15 hours agorootparentprevSince you mentioned Florida, the roads go from good to bad as soon as you cross the border into Alabama Same thing happens with California/Nevada. I-15 is wide, flat, beautiful and flawless on the Nevada side. As soon as you hit California, it's like a rural county road with no maintenance. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentI don’t notice much going between the two on I-80, well except you go from pretty straight desert roads into a freaking mountain range. Are mountains involved in the border at I-15 also? California is rated poorly on roads on average because they have a lot of rural/mountainous terrain to cover. In the cities where most people live, the roads are actually pretty good. reply lowbloodsugar 15 hours agorootparentprevI’ve driven track cars with bone shaking suspension from LA to Vegas and honestly don’t recall any difference. reply reaperducer 13 hours agorootparentI’ve driven track cars with bone shaking suspension from LA to Vegas and honestly don’t recall any difference. Funny, because it's in the Las Vegas newspapers every six months or so how the mayor of Las Vegas and the governor of Nevada are always begging California to upgrade its side of I-15. Almost every month there are 14-hour traffic jams on Sunday night as the SoCal crowd scurries home only to hit the bottleneck at the California border where I-15 goes from six lanes to four, then twists its way through the mountains. I've driven it many dozens of times in the last ten years, and it's well known among people who live in Nevada. reply lowbloodsugar 13 hours agorootparentMaybe Nevada could provide the money for it? Building roads on flat ground is easier than a freeway through the mountains is it not? And the primary beneficiary of the road is Vegas? Why would I want California taxes to subsidize Vegas gamblers? A road that is totally fine except Sunday night? Think about the two bits of road you are comparing: they are not representative. reply wombatpm 14 hours agorootparentprevCross from IL to WI on 94. The toll road ends and the reads are so much better. Of course WI will pull over any speeder with out of state plates. They even take credit cards to pay your fine on the spot. reply mandeepj 15 hours agorootparentprev> But yes, the roads are bad in Deep South states Interesting! Quite contrary from the prevailing wisdom - snow and salt destroy the roads. Maybe they don’t make them well to begin with. reply seanmcdirmid 15 hours agorootparentIt’s all the water and the clay they are built on, Florida just spends to get around it. reply gunapologist99 14 hours agorootparentprevOf course, Florida and Texas both have zero personal income tax. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentI live in Washington, so I’m not sure what the big deal of that is. reply jrockway 15 hours agorootparentprevI grew up in the suburbs. My town had pretty much no commercial base. The next town over had a huge mall. They had much better roads, a much better library, a sports complex, a swimming pool complex, the list goes on. It was obvious to a 10 year old how much of a difference the tax base made. Of course, we just got a library card in their district and I enjoyed the use of the nicer library as well. But still. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, it correlates fairly well, with Florida being the notable exception. I have no idea why their roads are so good. reply c-linkage 15 hours agorootparentTourism. reply lettergram 16 hours agorootparentprevMost of what you’re driving on could be federal highways. I’m in the same boat, have driven just about everywhere and I haven’t seen any major correlation. reply alienthrowaway 14 hours agorootparentI noticed an immediate degradation in surface quality on the interstate when I crossed into Alabama. Aren't the states responsible for upkeep using federal dollars? Some states are better than others at this. reply simfree 13 hours agorootparentInitial roadway construction is using primarily federal dollars, but long-term maintenance is usually primarily funded by the state or local municipality. reply SoftTalker 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's because they don't have winter. Winter, freezing/thawing, and salt is what destroys roads. reply asadotzler 15 hours agorootparentTell that to Mississippi which has s*t roads and no winter freezing/thawing or salt to consider. Broke ass red states can barely afford to keep their roads passable for the most part. There are a couple of exceptions where the states are willing to starve their children to keep the roads up, but most red states fail at both feeding kids and maintaining roads. If it wasn't for the cash infusion from the well off blue states, the red states would literally be third world. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentprevTell that to Tahoe or any of the many mountainous regions of CA. :) reply vondur 16 hours agorootparentprevRoads in California are good? We must live in different states. reply sushid 14 hours agorootparentIt truly depends within CA. San Diego or suburbs of LA? It's pristine. Bay Area? The roads flood with the slightest bit of rain and have potholes the size of a basketball. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentprevWhere are you from? To be fair, I mean relative to other states. Not that they’re perfect. reply wolverine876 16 hours agorootparentprevDon't forget the world-class higher education system, with the two of the top universities in the world. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentOh yeah, and spectacular public schooling - the state schools are top notch, as are many of the lower education public schools. reply geraldwhen 15 hours agorootparentLA county school system is one of the worst in the nation and it costs nearly the most. reply borski 10 hours agorootparentFair point. I don’t live in LA and was not aware of the school issues there. But by and large, CA does have great public school, and top-tier public universities. reply borkt 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat part of the state are you in with good roads? Sonoma county here, miserable roads reply borski 16 hours agorootparentBay Area, but I’m from NYC, so my standard for “bad road” is relatively high - there are a lot of potholes right now from the rain, but in general they get fixed quickly, the roads are wide and many-lanes, and generally don’t do insane things like loop back on themselves or anything like that. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentI disagree with this. I live in SF and the roads range from terrible to just-ok. And not just in the city; US-101 is just kinda ok (despite vaguely-regular maintenance), and many local roads I see in nearby smaller towns and cities (South SF, Daly City, Belmont, San Mateo) are -- at best -- just ok. Similar situation when I drive north toward Sonoma. A major issue in SF proper is that crews are constantly digging up parts of roads to work on pipes or whatever, and then patch them in a haphazard, crappy way. Roads get fully resurfaced rarely. As an example, there's a super nasty patched and re-patched and re-patched and re-patched section of 18th St (between Minnesota and Tennessee) that has been a nightmare for at least 4 years now. A section of Tennessee between 18th and 19th was resurfaced about a year ago (in part because there was building construction along the road that did heavy damage), but just this past week they were digging up a large section in the center of the road to do some work underneath, and when they patched it up, they as usual did a crap job, so the road sucks again. I grew up in New Jersey (80s) and Maryland (90s), and the roads were much better maintained in both of those places, Maryland especially. reply borski 12 hours agorootparentI agree SF has shit roads. I do not find that to be the case almost anywhere else in CA. I’ll put it this way too: while I’m mindful of potholes, generally, I have yet to have a single issue popping any of my 21” thin sidewall summer tires on my >5500lb EV. My counterparts in the South have popped between 2 and 10 depending on who you ask. The answer each time is: hit a pothole. Some of that’s driving. Some of it is also just the roads. They’re far from perfect. But they’re better than most other states. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprev> The roads here are way better than other places with lower taxes I live in San Francisco and absolutely disagree with this. The roads are garbage. And lest we think that's just a city thing, whenever I leave the city and drive out on local and state roads they range from garbage to ok-ish. My family moved to Maryland when I was a teenager, and the roads there were pristine (90s, not sure about nowadays). It felt like some section of some road or highway near me was always being resurfaced. reply nullc 15 hours agorootparentprevMy experience is that the Florida roads are significantly better than the roads in the bay area. And Florida has no income tax and lower sales taxes than California. reply borski 15 hours agorootparentI mentioned Florida as the notable outlier. They have a lot worse other things, but I agree the roads in FL are great. reply Tostino 14 hours agorootparentprevThey make up their tax revenue in other ways. reply jon_richards 16 hours agorootparentprev> Though Texas has no state-level personal income tax, it does levy relatively high consumption and property taxes on residents to make up the difference. Ultimately, it has a higher effective state and local tax rate for a median U.S. household at 12.73% than California's 8.97%, according to a new report from WalletHub. Obviously there are more than two states, but it’s not so simple. Plus, someone’s got to pay for everything: > [California] receives $0.99 in federal expenditures per dollar of taxes paid, which is below the national average return for states of $1.22 per dollar paid, according to its review of a 2015 New York Comptroller study. reply wolverine876 16 hours agorootparent> Plus, someone’s got to pay for everything: Bizarrely, even experts miss this obvious fact. If not income taxes, then how does government pay the bills? Income taxes are usually the most progressive tax, so no income tax usually means less wealthy people pay more. If government spends less, what services are cut? No income tax != free lunch. Someone has to pay. reply dillydogg 15 hours agorootparentYeah it's very funny hearing my dad talk about how nice it is to have no income tax in Washington (he's a dentist). But when you tell him that the relatively higher income tax is worse for poor people he doesn't seem to agree. Washington is certainly a progressive state on the whole, but the taxation is horrible. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparent> relatively higher income tax is worse for poor people How is it worse for poor people? reply lobocinza 13 hours agorootparentprevGovernments can do less and spend more wisely. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparentWhat solution does that offer?

Really?

There are tons of low-hanging fruits, at least in South America, the issue is that government doesn't exist to provide services and seek the interests of the population. Government is just a big mafia and things are corrupt and inneficient by design because their true goal is to fill their pockets. reply johnnyanmac 2 hours agorootparent>invest in what really matters to them You see libraries and schools barely having enough funding to function while consumers spend thousands on entertainment. I don't really trust the average Joe to know \"what really matters\". Or at least not realize it matters until it's too late. Not to say government spending doesn't have its share of inefficiencies and outright corruption. But they at least have some checks to keep it from going off thr deep end (both literally and socially via elections). reply wolverine876 9 hours agorootparentprev> Really? Are you surprised I'm just not accepting the trope as God-given truth? Get used to it. :) > If people weren't forced to pay as much taxes as they have today they would have more resources to invest in what really matters to them instead of having a bunch of bureacrauts wasting it. And they'd have less services provided by government. Anyway, your claim is a trope, but let's actually examine it: People want government to do certain things; government does things that \"really matter\". Nobody gets exactly what they want from anything - the restaurant, their family members, employers, etc., or from government. I know the word 'bureaucrat' has been demonized, but that's not evidence (in fact, it's evidence IME of right-wing propaganda). I personally know some government bureaucrats well, and they are serious professionals, completely committed to their job and to public service. Government waste is long been a trope of the right-wing propaganda, as a way to persuade people to cut taxes (for the wealthy) and reduce government's influence (which democratically counters that of powerful people), but I've never seen evidence that government is more wasteful than other sizeable institutions - if you've seen the inside of a mid-sized corporation, you would recognize it. Same with churches, non-profits etc etc. If you have evidence, that's one thing. Just repeating these claims doesn't make them true. It makes them ripe to be challenged. > There are tons of low-hanging fruits, at least in South America, the issue is that government doesn't exist to provide services and seek the interests of the population. Government is just a big mafia and things are corrupt and inneficient by design because their true goal is to fill their pockets. Who is there only to provide services? Don't businesses also want to fill their pockets?

Anecdata, but a counterpoint to your general claim. reply fzeroracer 16 hours agorootparentprevI lived in Texas making six figures as a SWE. Texas was not far better tax wise. Texas does a lot to ding you in ways that aren't taxes, and buying a home that doesn't involve an hour and a half commute one way is unrealistic. reply dillydogg 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you not care about people who do not make SWE wages? reply zoklet-enjoyer 15 hours agorootparentprevNonsense?

I totally get why people conceptually hate the idea of paying taxes, even if my values lead me to a very different conclusion. That said, most of the arguments I've encountered about places with higher taxes being worse places to live strike me as either glib and uninformed, or in bad faith.

Lure the coworker into a conference room on some pretense or another, then bring out a cake. Of course, once it became routine, it's rather hard to surprise someone -- any irregular meetings on your birthday are extremely suspect. So for one coworker's birthday, a week after we'd just done another's, I scheduled JACK'S BIG ANNOUNCEMENT on his birthday. He, of course, was extremely suspicious, and assumed it was a front for his birthday. I made my announcement, brought out the champagne (well, sparkling Catawba), went out into the hallway to get a corkscrew, and came back in with the birthday cake. So he had the whiplash of, wait, is this not for my birthday after all, wait, if it is, then are you not having a baby? And I declined to clarify until after I started my paternity leave, and half my coworkers didn't believe it until after I brought the kiddo in to show off.

I worked for a team that did this - putting your birthday on the spreadsheet was entirely optional, as well as attending any celebratory hallway things. Nobody was forcing anybody to do anything. If you had a conflict or was busy working, or just plain didn't want to participate, everybody understood and wouldn't mind. FWIW I usually didn't participate nor did I let anybody know my birthday and I never felt excluded. reply caymanjim 16 hours agorootparentIt's one thing to say \"we're celebrating Bob's birthday so there's cake in the kitchen\", or \"we're going out to lunch for Jill's birthday\". You should get Bob and Jill's permission before you do that, but if they're cool with it, then by all means. I can decide for myself if I want to participate, or make a polite excuse not to. Throwing me a surprise birthday? I hate you. Inviting me to a meeting that I feel obligated to attend, only for it to be a surprise birthday? If it's for someone else, I'll just smile and pretend to enjoy it for the minimum socially-acceptable time and then bow out. If you did that for my birthday I would be pissed off. I'd still smile and pretend to enjoy it, but it would be excruciating torture for me.

Since it's happening during work and between coworkers it's work. I'd rather do actual work instead of pretending to be glad that coworkers are celebrating my birthday. Actually they aren't. For them \"it's cake and a break from work\". So they basically have fun at my expense. That's exactly why I always take a day off on my birthday. To do what *I* want to do on *MY* birthday. And the cake part : sure, if you like bad food, don't care about your health and don't have allergies, that's perfect. But that's not everybody's case. Having gone through a weight loss journey during my twenties, work was the only place where I felt pressure from other people to stop my efforts and join them in their trash food orgies. So I completely understand where @caymanjim's comment is coming from. I'm probably a miserable person, if you say so. As a coworker, I'll go out of my way if you ask for help around work or personal issues. But I will never impose on yourself something that is not directly related to our jobs. You like having a party for your birthday at work? Awesome! If bosses are okay with that, have fun with all the other coworkers that share this same feeling!

If the HR have the guidelines of making the employes happy - then you absolutely can share information with them, making planning easier - with the result of a better outcome for everyone. Like when the wife will give birth. \"So hey, concratulations, good to know, so we can plan around it\" - if it is a good company.

Not to mention that the abstracted layer above - whether the company has employee-friendly or employee-hostile policies when it comes to HR team - is also ultimately down to people with the same potential for good and bad. \"HR work for the company not for you, don't trust them\" is a reasonable general rule considering the average HR department especially in large companies, but it's not a guarantee that all HR people, or even all HR teams' policies will be evil. reply lb1lf 16 hours agorootparentprevAgreed; I believe the tipping point is where the company becomes so large that you no longer know, or at least are familiar with the people you're working with.

Not that the wife was due the following Tuesday. We don't know how far out the due date was based on what OP said. I agree that employees should give sufficient notice for something like that.

You're saying capitalism is about prioritizing the rights to capital accumulation by the current holders of capital, which is one specific form of capitalism, often called crony capitalism. Private ownership of the means of production is more orthogonal to workers rights. There are capitalist economics in countries with very strong workers rights and unions, but where the means of production are still privately owned. Capitalism is fully compatible with strong family and medical leave protections, even though those who own the means of production are disincentived in the short term from giving workers rights. The fact that the US is worse on workers rights isn't a problem unique to capitalism. reply Cheer2171 16 hours agorootparentprevSo called \"right to work\" laws that actually give employers the right to fire for no cause. As long as an employer doesn't say what the cause was, employers in those states can fire you for \"no cause\" even if the hidden reason would be an illegal cause if they stated it. It's only illegal if someone gets caught specifically saying the firing was because the employee is having a kid. Coincidences are not considered admissable evidence in those courts. reply johnnyanmac 2 hours agorootparent>reason would be an illegal cause if they stated it. That's true but it's also exactly what you go to court for. Then the court audits and determines if this was a coincidence or malice. That's why employers don't often make it this obvious.

The first allows no-reason, no-notice termination of employment by both parties (which doesn’t really work - the employee usually needs income more than the employer needs a single employer).

Systems that prioritize money over humans are disgusting, and, sadly, we have far too many of them in modern society. Note that we implicitly recognize this through law: there is no such thing as a \"free market\". Markets are regulated, and we have things like FMLA because we understand that capitalism is heartless, and if we allowed it free rein, we'd live in a dystopian society that no one except the wealthy elite would actually want. Unfortunately, even with all that, we still don't control enough of capitalism's negative effects on people. That's why I downvoted you. Also, don't complain about downvotes. That's against the HN guidelines, and will usually get you downvoted further; complaining about downvotes rarely leads to interesting discussion.

But even if it's the former, so what?

Dariusz is a victim of circumstance, a mental unwillingness to stop working for any period of time, a situation I have also tried to stop friends who were exploited from workplaces in the restaurant industry again and again. Only mental health would have saved him from throwing himself off the metaphorical cliff; if not Amazon, another place. You read it correctly but I feel sympathy for the victim. reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentNonsense. You didn't know this person at all, and I suspect you aren't a licensed psychiatrist, so you have no place diagnosing him with some sort of work-himself-to-death mental illness. The most likely and simplest explanation is that he believed he needed this job in order to survive, and as the staff around his job function was reduced and he was given more to do, he felt he had no choice but to do the extra work that was assigned to him, or else lose his job and suffer financial ruin. reply graphe 13 hours agorootparentHe diagnosed himself when he worked himself to death after years of neglecting his health. You may believe he had a strong sense of self preservation or mentally healthy if you wish to. reply neilv 14 hours agorootparentprevMaybe there is this related-sounding issue that has been close to you from friends, and you are sensitized to try to spot it elsewhere (like we learn from trauma)? Is it possible that the person in the article didn't fully fit the pattern to which you've been sensitized, and that the biggest cause in that case is actually different? Also, in case of your friends, maybe there are two problems to address: (1) any weakness of self or situation that makes them vulnerable to being exploited; and (2) any party that consciously or negligently exploits that. Maybe the reason I'm pushing back on this: I've known people who soldier through tough situations they shouldn't have to, including someone who died from it. In all cases, they tried hard to get out of the situation, but people who were the cause of the bad, or whose job was to be a check on the bad, either refused to help, or made it worse by trying to cover it up rather than fix it. I think that to blame the victims in those situations would be incorrect. reply graphe 13 hours agorootparentThe end result was that in all these cases, they worked themselves to death and they had a poor sense of self preservation. This is the pattern I see. If I was to be positive on Amazon I'd suggest that they may have paid bonuses or some incentives to keep him there. I believe that Dariusz may have been paid bonuses but I ignored that as it wasn't important for self preservation, I'm taking the negative stance that they fostered this environment, but the writer did not die or want to leave the job, and many others quit due to their own sense of self preservation. Self preservation isn't an innate trait and I feel sympathy for Dariusz that he did not have that trait. reply whatshisface 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's so nice and comforting to think that this person could have died voluntarily, thank you for that fantasy. /s reply CodeMage 17 hours agoparentprev> The man didn't seem to want to quit, from the context, it's possible the person did not tell the truth.

Something isn't adding up. reply CodeMage 15 hours agorootparentWhat \"isn't adding up\" in that paragraph is possibly a problem with the reading comprehension. Dariusz requested a change, but it wasn't granted and he had to work alone for another five hours. Granted, the sentence could have been phrased in a way that didn't leave things open to your interpretation, but then we come to the second thing that \"doesn't add up\": your own bias, evident in your insistence on victim-blaming. People like Dariusz continue working in adverse, unhealthy conditions because they don't have the luxury of just quitting. reply graphe 15 hours agorootparentYou don't know his story or anything about him, you are making up a narrative and insulting me.

The rest of us are just reading the article and going by what it says: he was overworked, he complained about it, his requests for help were denied, so he kept working. Is it so completely unfathomable that someone would stay in a job that is deleterious to their health because they need the job, and the money, and fear that they won't be able to find something else, and end up hungry or homeless? Because that's the norm. Not this weird mental illness you've somehow decided he had, without any evidence to support your theory. reply CodeMage 14 hours agorootparentprevI am not making up a narrative, I am presenting alternatives to the narrative you made up from the start. You're the one who said that Magda might not have been truthful and you offered arguments based on your own narrative about Dariusz being able to choose to quit freely, without consequences, and choosing to work himself to death. I provided counterarguments by showing how there are other alternatives you didn't think of. As for insults, it was not my intention to insult you and I'm not sure which part of my reply you found insulting. If it was the reading comprehension, then I apologize for the way it sounded: I merely meant to say you might not have understood the sentence properly, which is something that happens to everyone. If it was the part where I pointed out your bias, that's on you. When I point out that the person you're trying to blame for their own death might not conform to your own expectations -- the expectation that they are free to choose to quit without any consequences -- you're perfectly happy to call that a \"fantasy\", but you don't apply the same label to your own ideas about people who \"want to work themselves to death\". If you find the description of your biases insulting, maybe you should re-evaluate them. reply graphe 14 hours agorootparentJacobian is a biased publication and I have read other untruthful biases they presented. I do not trust it. Dariusz worked himself to death, thanks in no small part to Amazon. Some people can be coaxed into working to death, I've known several people that have died in the restaurant business, they put themselves in that situation, they knew it was bad for years and they are a victim of circumstances just as Dariusz was. Where do you draw personal responsibility? They had been complaining, they did the same work or more, it was dangerous and bad. We don't ban jobs like roughnecks and our culture of rewarding working too hard is a problem. Some people love the high pressure tough on your body jobs, play hard work hard lifestyle.

There is no political statement besides the always work harder ethic which I don't agree with. reply CodeMage 13 hours agorootparent> Where do you draw personal responsibility? That depends on the power imbalance. The power dynamics in a job market are not symmetrical. The employees and employers are not on equal footing and don't wield the same power. The power imbalance becomes more pronounced the lower you go in the pecking order, with blue-collar laborers being the lowest rung. In short, the more an employer is in position to exploit their workers, the more responsibility they should bear. That's one of two ways to prevent exploitation. The other way is to shift the power balance back, by organizing into unions, which is why Amazon, Starbucks, and similar companies have been engaging in union-busting quite a lot. > We don't ban jobs like roughnecks and our culture of rewarding working too hard is a problem. That's one part of the cultural problem. Another important part is the constant indoctrination, from a rather young age, against workers' rights and in favor of exploitation. That's how we end up with so many people who are biased towards corporations and always looking for ways to absolve them from their wrongdoings. > There is no political statement besides the always work harder ethic which I don't agree with. Of course there's a political statement there. The political statement is right there in assigning disproportionate blame to the worker who has repeatedly requested to be treated in a way that would not lead to his death, and not enough blame to the employer who refused to consider those requests. That's what politics are -- or should be -- really about: real lives of real people. We're all used to looking at politics as machinations of the political class, but that's not how things are supposed to be. reply graphe 13 hours agorootparent>The power dynamics in a job market are not symmetrical.

Why did the writer choose to stay for years knowing it was a poor work environment? The context matters. Was Dariusz was unwilling to find a job, indentured to Amazon, unable to find another job, or was it another factor? Self preservation is always everyone's right, lawless or not.

Was Dariusz was unwilling to find a job, indentured to Amazon, unable to find another job, or was it another factor? No, it doesn't. Not for what you're arguing. You made a claim about personal responsibility. I replied to it by pointing out the power imbalance between the employer and their employees. You took it to mean that the power imbalance between the employer and each individual employee matters. It does not. Think, for a moment, about what you're arguing here. Dariusz has repeatedly requested changes to his working conditions, because those conditions were too exhausting for his health. Amazon repeatedly chose to not grant any of those requests. The argument you present here is that whether Dariusz was unwilling or unable to find the job should somehow change the responsibility that Amazon has towards making sure that the Dariusz's working conditions wouldn't end up killing him. If that is your position -- and I suspect it is, given all the replies on this topic where you characterize Dariusz as a person with subpar mental health who lack self-preservation instinct -- then we have reached a fundamentally irreconcilable disagreement of a moral/ethical nature. reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentprevAh, so here it comes out. You don't like the publication, so instead of just ignoring it and finding a better source, you make up some other bizarre, unlikely narrative just because you have a bias against the author. I certainly agree that there are people who will work themselves to death. But: So what? Any work culture or organization that puts someone in that position is the one primarily at fault. It's not like Amazon was saying \"oh, stop working so hard, you're going to kill yourself\" but he ignored that and kept working. They were intentionally removing staff that did the same work he was doing, and constantly piled up more work on his plate. And it's not like he was ok with it! He complained, and his requests for help were ignored. Even in the extremely unlikely event that he had some sort of mental illness that caused him to ignore the signals of overwork his body was giving him... nope, still not his fault. Still Amazon's fault. reply 161 more comments... GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "About OpenTTD is an open source simulation game based upon the popular Microprose game \"Transport Tycoon Deluxe\", written by Chris Sawyer. It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features. OpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0. For more information, see the file COPYING.md included with every release and source download of the game. Features OpenTTD is modelled after the original Transport Tycoon game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by TTDPatch while others are original. Significant enhancements from the original game include: bigger maps (up to 64 times in size) stable multiplayer mode for up to 255 players in 15 companies, or as spectators dedicated server mode and an in-game console for administration IPv6 and IPv4 support for all communication of the client and server in game downloading of AIs, NewGRFs, scenarios and heightmaps new pathfinding algorithms that makes vehicles go where you want them to autorail/-road build tool, improved terraforming canals, shiplifts, aqueducts larger, non-uniform stations and the ability to join them together mammoth and multi-headed trains different configurable models for acceleration of vehicles clone, autoreplace and autoupdate vehicles the possibility to build on slopes and coasts advanced/conditional orders, share and copy orders longer and higher bridges including several new designs, plus fully flexible tracks/roads under bridges reworked airport system with many more airports/heliports (e.g. international and metropolitan) presignals, semaphores, path based signalling support for TTDPatch NewGRF features offering many options for graphics and behaviour configuration/modification drive-through road stops for articulated road vehicles and trams multiple trees on one tile bribe the town authority many configuration settings to tune the game to your liking save games using zlib compression for smaller sizes, while not interrupting gameplay significant internationalisation support. OpenTTD has already been translated into over 50 languages dynamically created town names in 18 languages, plus NewGRF support for additional languages freely distributable graphics, sounds and music framework for custom (user) written AIs zooming further out in the normal view and zooming out in the small map Lots of effort has been put into making OpenTTD easy to use. These include: convert rail tool (to electrified rail, monorail, and maglev) drag&drop support for almost all tools (demolition, road/rail building/removing, stations, scenario editor, etc) sorting of most lists based on various criteria (vehicle, station, town, industries, etc.) mouse wheel support (scroll menus, zoom in/out) autoscroll when the mouse is near the edge of the screen/window sell whole train by dragging it to the dynamite trashcan cost estimation with the 'shift' key advanced options configuration window, change settings from within the game Graphical/interface features: screenshots can be in BMP, PNG or PCX format (select in game options menu) more currencies (including Euro introduction in 2002) extra viewports to view more parts of the game world at the same time resolution and refresh rate selection for fullscreen mode colourful newspaper after a certain date colour coded vehicle profits game speed increase (through fast forward button or by pressing the TAB key) snappy and sticky windows that always stay on top and neatly align themselves to other windows more hotkeys for even less mouse-clicking support for 32 bit graphics support for right-to-left languages support for other (sized) fonts where the user interface scales based on the font and translation Posting a full list would be futile as it would mean updating this page almost daily, and even then some things might be forgotten.

It would always quickly take the lead, so I'd set up my own bus routes, then order all my buses to stop in the middle of the road at once. This would lead to massive gridlock, effectively denying the AI profit while its operating costs dragged it to bankruptcy. When it went bust, I'd buy out the company, then allow my (now) hundreds of buses to move again! reply amlib 10 hours agorootparentIt's a fantastic game to play co-operatively but also competitively with a couple of your friends.

You had to build a tunnel that spanned the entire width of the map, which would cost just more than 2 billion dollars, underflowing and giving you 2 billion instead. Afterwards, the game was a pure sandbox, and that's the only way I played it as a kid.

The auto-rail feature is nice, as is the one where it lets you to semaphore up a straight line with a single mouse drag, but building each rail junction by hand... I just can't find it in me anymore. It feels like typing out boilerplate code by hand. reply michalc 3 hours agoprevRelated: I recently made OpenTTDLab https://github.com/michalc/OpenTTDLab that can run OpenTTD headlessly from Python and extract data from its savegames in a hopefully fairly straightforward way.

If it's signaling, try to use one way signal with loops at the end for turnaround. If you need junctions, look it online and just copy it without much thinking until you get better with this. Turn off vehicles breakdowns, and there's setting to change towns to follow 2x2 or 3x3 grid, which will make building easier. To make early money, look for two cities (they have City label on their name) with high enough population and close enough distance, and make 7 length station on both. You'll want to run 7 length on every passenger train in the end, it'll simplify the design. The ui and menus may be confusing at first, but you'll get used to it. reply petepete 10 hours agorootparentprevI'd try watching the intro YouTube series by MasterHellish and concentrating on a particular industry to start with, it can get overwhelming when there's lots going on. reply o11c 10 hours agorootparentprevPlay online, there's a small community running regular public coop games.

It's a full-fledged programming language that's there in anything remotely unix-flavored, but I mostly see it used in one-liners to grab bits of text from piped stdout. But you can use awk as a general-purpose scripting language [1], in many ways it's nicer than bash for this purpose. I wonder why you don't see more awk scripts in the wild. I suppose perl came along and tried to combine the good features of shell, awk, and sed into one language, and then people decided perl was bad and moved on from that. [1] Random excerpt from NetBSD's source code https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/trunk/sys/dev/eisa/devlis... reply dkarl 14 hours agoparentYou nailed it. Perl replaced awk and then turned out to be counterproductive in a lot of cases because there was no simple and broadly understood way for people to write Perl code that was 1) readable for other programmers and 2) scalable to medium-to-large programs. Which is not to say that nobody ever figured out those things and did them well, just that the success rate was low enough across the industry to earn Perl a really bad reputation. I'd like to see a revival of awk. It's less easy to scale up, so there's very little risk that starting a project with a little bit of awk results in the next person inheriting a multi-thousand line awk codebase. Instead, you get an early-ish rewrite into a more scalable and maintainable language. reply kradroy 14 hours agorootparent> I'd like to see a revival of awk. It's less easy to scale up, so there's very little risk that starting a project with a little bit of awk results in the next person inheriting a multi-thousand line awk codebase. Instead, you get an early-ish rewrite into a more scalable and maintainable language. Taco Bell programming is the way to go. This is the thinking I use when putting together prototypes. You can do a lot with awk, sed, join, xargs, parallel (GNU), etc. But it's really a lot of effort to abstract in a bash script, so the code is compact. I've built many data engineering/ML systems with this technique. Those command line tools are SO WELL debugged and have reasonable error behavior that you don't have to worry about complexities of exception handling, etc. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 5 hours agorootparentThe problem Perl and the like have to contend with is that they have to compete with Python. If a dependency needs to be installed to do something you have to convince me that whatever language and script is worthwhile to maintain over Python which is the next de jure thing people reach for after bash. The nice thing about awk is that it’s baked in. So it has an advantage. You can convince me awk is better because I don’t have to deal with dependency issues, but it’s a harder sell for anything I have to install before I can use And it’s not even that Python is a great language. Or has a great package manager or install situation. It doesn’t have any of those things. It does, however, have the likelihood of the next monkey after me understanding it. Which is unfortunately more than can be said about Perl reply GrumpySloth 1 hour agorootparentPerl is installed by default on most Unix systems. FreeBSD being the exception. Python isn’t. Although Python is popular; if we’re comparing the probability of someone having the interpreter installed already, it’s greater for Perl, even if people aren’t aware they already have it. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 5 minutes agorootparentThough one would probably never be able to work with an assumed install of Python anyway because one would not be able to assume a specific version. I am guessing this is a lesser problem for Perl, since it’s been frozen at some version of 5 for the past 25-30 years correct? reply KerrAvon 4 hours agorootparentprevBingo. I would argue Ruby has the quality of being a great language the next person can understand, but I think Rails has prejudiced people. reply Towaway69 2 hours agorootparentAgree, Ruby is a wonderful language that is unfortunately dominated by an opinionated Web framework. Job descriptions tend to be looking for rails developers and forgetting that actually its Ruby developers they are looking for. reply patmorgan23 7 hours agorootparentprevMay Introduce you to https://bashsta.cc/ reply cmgbhm 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat Perl nailed was being useful to write cross platform shell scripts. Agree that it didn’t scale up but you had a chance of delivering n platforms with minimal pain. awk v gawk doesn’t make me want o to relive those days. reply fourfun 7 hours agorootparentprevI’ve seen enough awk behemoths in my time, no thanks. reply cpeterso 6 hours agorootparentI’m curious: what are some problems where awk was (presumably) a reasonable choice at first but then the implementation grew into a behemoth? Did the solution need to grow as the problem grew? Or was awk just the wrong choice from the beginning? reply fourfun 4 hours agorootparentOne case I saw it used was for processing genomics data. It was kinda ok at first but when we needed to add a new sequencing type it was laborious. Personally I don’t think awk is a good choice for anything beyond one liners and personal scripts. Here it was fine because it was (initially) some write-once academic code that needed to not be insanely slow. reply sgarland 13 hours agoparentprevAwk is incredibly useful. I wrote a script this week to parse Postgres logs (many, many GB) to answer the question, \"what were the top users making queries in the first few minutes at the top of every hour?\" [0] Took a couple of functions, maybe 20 LOC in total, plus some pipes through sort and uniq [1]. Also quite fast, especially if you prefix it with LC_ALL=C. [0]: If you're wondering why there wasn't adequate observability in place to not have to do this, you're not wrong, but sometimes you must live with the reality you have. [1]: Yes, I know gawk can do a unique sort while building the list. It was late into an incident and I was tired, andsortuniq -csort -rn is a lot easier to remember. [1].a: Yes, I know sort has a -u arg. It doesn't provide a count, and its unique function is also quite a bit slower than uniq's implementation. reply v3ss0n 4 hours agorootparentyou can do that in a lot lesser line of code in python and much better performance. reply anonnon 14 hours agoparentprev> then people decided perl was bad and moved on from that. That's a large part of what's driving Awk's renaissance: devs that never learned Perl to begin with want something to fill the gap between shell and Python, and other devs like me who (reluctantly) abandoned Perl because it was deemed \"uncool\" by HN types, which means Perl and all code written in it now has an expiration date on it. But since Awk is a POSIX standard, HN types can't get rid of it. reply bigstrat2003 12 hours agorootparent\"HN types\" can't get rid of perl either. So just use perl if you want to. Personally I think perl is a terrible language and that anything which is too complex for a shell script (which is most things) should just be done in python. But if you disagree, it's not like anyone can stop you. If your issue is \"my teammates hate it and want me to use something else\", I promise you they will be just as annoyed if you use awk. reply lanstin 10 hours agorootparentI'm pretty sure people have read more perl code than awk code, so they'll roll their eyes but will be able to cover for perl-required tasks, but won't build up the courage to touch the awk. To me, hell is having to debug perl scripts other people wrote. Based on experiences in the 1998 time frame. reply Almondsetat 13 hours agorootparentprevcan't wait for the day I will be able to compile Linux without Perl reply LinuxProtips 1 hour agorootparentYou can do that right now. Sabotage Linux rewrote the one and only perl dependency in awk years ago. Grab https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage/ma... and clobber the perl script in the Linux source. Then: sed -i -e 's@perl $(srctree)/$(src)/build_OID_registry@awk -f $(srctree)/$(src)/build_OID_registry@' ./lib/Makefile They also removed the perl dependency for ca-certificates since one of the goals was to remove perl dependencies from the core system including its toolchain and kernel. It's not needed at all now. This Aho project is neat because it has the potential of removing the perl dependency on having a git client, which was a problem prior. reply fuzztester 5 hours agorootparentprevthat's the day I'll eat my red hat reply v3ss0n 4 hours agoparentprevawk isn't readable. modern programming languages can do things much better than awk in much lesser lines of code.all of them have better code to work with text and string. reply GrumpySloth 1 hour agorootparent> much lesser lines of code Doubtful. awk has a lot of implicit behaviour which allows the programmer to write very terse scripts. An equivalent Python program is usually several times longer. reply bagful 9 hours agoparentprevI love AWK. Its stringly-typedness would make a Javascript programmer blush: 0, “”, and actually-nothing are identically falsey. Numbers are no different from strings representing numbers, like Lua. Somehow, I don’t mind — if you really need to keep your numbers numbers and strings strings, sigilate the value (prepend with #/$) and peel it off with a substr() later. reply samatman 6 hours agorootparentI like the way Lua handles strings and numbers quite a bit. They're different types, but arithmetic will convert a string to a number when it can. This is without footguns, because concatenation is a different operator entirely. 2 + \"3\" -- 5 2 .. \"3\" -- \"23\" It's rather convenient, especially when you can combine it with LPeg to parse files with numbers in them, then do the maths directly. reply garaetjjte 9 hours agorootparentprevLua does not represent numbers with strings. It does have number type which is always floating-point. reply nmz 8 hours agorootparentIntegers were introduced in 5.3. reply csdvrx 15 hours agoparentprev> then people decided perl was bad and moved on from that.

Awk could use improvement in numerous areas. Oh, for instance, you can pass associative arrays into functions, but not return them. Functions that filter array to array have to take an output array parameter. Using extra parameters as the only way to get local variables is also a smell. a[i] syntax cannot index into strings, what the hell? reply ksherlock 11 hours agorootparentCVS support (--csv) was added last year (to the one true awk and gnu awk) reply chris_wot 12 hours agorootparentprevJust for contex, Aho is 82, Weinberger is 81 and Kerrighan is dead. reply ksherlock 11 hours agorootparentBrian Kernighan is alive. reply usr1106 34 minutes agorootparentHe gave a keynote at what I believe was the last Linuxconf Australia.

It's possible to pass them values, but you're not supposed to. I wrote a patch for GNU Awk to give it a let statement for binding true lexical variables, so that this could be: function read_objfile(obj, objpath) { @let (bytes, end_of_header, header, end_of_type, type, size, bytes_after_header) { } } Unfortunately, this was rejected by the project; I was encouraged to make a renamed fork of GNU Awk, so that's what I did. https://www.kylheku.com/cgit/egawk/about/ reply coliveira 12 hours agoparentI feel they have a point, gawk has already too many differences compared to awk. If you introduce even more distinct syntax, it is better just to fork it and call it something else. reply freedomben 13 hours agoprevWhen people ask me why I say that the linux command line is the best dev environment, Awk is one of the tools I often point to. When you know even basic awk, you can do a lot with a little. IDEs actually start to feel clunky. If you're looking to get into Awk, and you learn well from a lecture style, I put together a talk for Linux Fest Northwest some years ago and recorded it for Youtube: https://youtu.be/E5aQxIdjT0M reply makeitdouble 8 hours agoparentAt the same time unicode support was added super late (like 2 years ago ?), like any other shell tools passing content to awk by piping has edge cases (anything ressembling a CTRL+D sequence will cut the feed, and there must be dozens of other edge cases I have no idea about that will only bite me at the worst time. Awk is an impressive tool, but putting it on a pedastal blinds people from the weak spots and why they should probably move serious tasks to more specialized, but modern and adapted tools. reply themk 4 hours agorootparentYou have to be trying pretty hard to make a CTRL-D cut the feed when piping into shell tools. That only comes into effect when the input is coming from a pty, and that only when it's in a very specific mode that is meant for interactive use. reply corytheboyd 11 hours agoparentprevHow does awk replace an IDE? I love awk, I love how powerful it is if you spend the time to learn it, but if I didn’t have an IDE I would be significantly less productive. Most of what an IDE does is help you understand and change code, not text editing operations. Not trying to say you’re wrong, just curious what your angle is with that statement. reply freedomben 8 hours agorootparentThanks, to clarify, I don't mean that just awk replaces an IDE. I mean that the Linux command line replaces an IDE, specifically the functions like finding references, substitutions, transformations, etc. It doesn't replace syntax highlighting and stuff of course, though I get that from Vim. It's never going to be as powerful as a specialized IDE would for a specific language, but the Linux CLI is language agnostic and even works on just text files, so it's universally applicable and doesn't change depending on the language of the project. For me it's better than an IDE, but YMMV of course because everybody is different. reply dexzod 2 hours agoprevI don't understand how you can write more that one line long program in a language where all variables are global by default even if they are inside a scope delimited by brackets. You can have local variables but the syntax is weird. https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Variable-... reply Towaway69 16 hours agoprevGreat project and great idea. Understanding the basics gives one different perspectives for other projects and problems. Back in the day I created a Web-based wiki using awk. Why? Because I was using linksys router with minimal memory. It was a great learning both how wikis work and what can be done with awk. And since there are no libraries to fallback on, I had to implement the basics and gain all the understandings. reply sampo 16 hours agoprev> I don't plan to add network functionality to this (even though you totally can), so no clone or push. You can also git clone from a repository in a different directory in the same computer. And push to. reply d-lisp 14 hours agoparentExactly, but having branches kind of allow you to not have to create local clones. And I legit use rsync to clone locally git repos. The question is : what is the best ? reply nerdponx 13 hours agorootparentYou can have multiple worktrees per repo. Usually that's the best solution instead of local clones. reply kazinator 2 hours agorootparentThe git-worktree man page says: BUGS Multiple checkout in general is still experimental, and the support for submodules is incomplete. It is NOT recommended to make multiple checkouts of a superproject. Source: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree It complicates git with more cruft. A separate clone is more understandable and independent.

All variables are global, except for function parameters.

Then I might use it for my deep learning models. reply aseipp 12 hours agoparentNo, Git's object store was not designed to hold large binary blobs, and no implementation of Git in any language can change this. It's a reasonable request; I mean, Git doesn't even deal with \"pretty small\" binary files very well, either. But it's all simply a consequence of its design that was thought up all those years ago. The core object storage model and data format (and many, many things on top of those) have to be changed/extended/fixed first, but it's realistically an immense change, so git-lfs and other various solutions are about as good as it'll get in the mean time. reply supriyo-biswas 15 hours agoparentprevIt doesn't, since Git's data model has to be changed to content-defined chunks to solve the issue. You should look at git-lfs[1] instead.

TBH I’m increasingly frustrated by the amount of code written in Bash. I kind of hate Python for various reasons. But if 100% of Bash was replaced with Python I think the world would be a better place. reply Brian_K_White 1 hour agoparentOnly if python gained the ability to execute externals and handle stdin/stdout/stderr, return value, & environment directly instead of through exec(). And ditched the meaningful indentation. And was backwards compatible so that old scripts work today and today scripts work tomorrow. Bash has it's own uglies so I guess it's fair enough to compare two imperfect things, but the problem is these are two different jobs, and python just doesn't do the job bash does, and that job needs doing, so python can't be the replacement. reply riddley 14 hours agoparentprevI'm mostly in concordance, but one thing I think every scripting language got wrong is how painful it is to run external binaries. Sure it can be done but it could be as easy as a shell script. reply wazbug 11 hours agorootparentRuby is nice in this regard though :-) x = `git --version` puts(x) #=> \"git version 2.43.0\" reply KerrAvon 4 hours agorootparentRuby is really nice in this regard, in fact — you’re not limited to backticks; you can use any quote delimiters you want. reply forrestthewoods 14 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. That said, stdout/stderr is such a bloody, inconsistent nightmare. I’m not totally convinced that “chain small binary programs together” is better than “one language with useful libraries”. Bash is admittedly nice for small things. But it always spirals out of control. And rarely gets ported. Also my life is primarily Windows and if you want everything to “just work” across mac/linux/win it’s easier to just use Python or sometimes even Rust.

Rapaport Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Philosophy, and Center for Cognitive Science State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260-2000 Last Update: Thursday, 14 September 2023 Note: or material is highlighted PDF version (25 January 2018) If you are reading a printed version of this, you might be interested in the Web version, at https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html which has numerous links to other helpful Web sites (indicated in some printed versions by underlined phrases). Belorussian — German — Italian — Portuguese — Russian — Spanish — Ukrainian OUTLINE and INDEX: Introduction Manage your time Take notes in class & rewrite them at home Study hard subjects first & study in a quiet place Read actively & slowly, before & after class Do your homework Study for exams Take Exams Do research & write essays Do I really have to do all this? Are there other websites that give study hints? 1. Introduction It has been claimed that everyone has a different \"learning style\". If you believe in the existence and validity of learning styles, then you might find some of the following references of interest: Claxton & Murrell 1987, \"Learning Styles\" (Wikipedia), Keirsey Temperament and Character Web Site, William Perry's Scheme of Intellectual and Ethical Development, Holland 1966, Kolb 1984, Sternberg 1999. For some online tools targeted at different learning styles, see \"100 Helpful Web Tools for Every Kind of Learner\". However, there is no evidence that supports their use! The major study is Pashler et al. 2009; see also Glenn 2009/2010 and Willingham 2008, who writes: \"using learning-styles theories in the classroom does not bring an advantage to students. … There's increasing evidence that people [who claim to have learning preferences] act on those beliefs …. But doing so confers no cognitive advantage. People believe they have learning styles, and they try to think in their preferred style, but doing so doesn't help them think.\" (pp. 28–29) But everyone surely has a different \"studying style\". More importantly, the way that you are studying right now might not be the best for you: How would you know? Easy: If your grades aren't what you'd like them to be, then you probably need to change how you study! One important clarification before we begin: \"Studying\" is not the same thing as \"doing homework\"! Studying may include doing homework, but it is also a lot more, as you will see. (So, if you say that you have no homework and that therefore you can't, or you don't have to, study, you're mistaken!) I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. They worked for me when I was in high school, college, and graduate school. Not only that, but they worked equally well for me in humanities courses (like philosophy and literature) and in science courses (like math and computer science). But, to the extent that everyone's styles may be different, some of my suggestions may not work for you, at least not without some individual modifications. Nevertheless, I urge you to try them. Most successful students use them (or some slight variation of them). Please feel free to send me suggestions for studying that worked for you. I will try to include them in further versions of this guide. 2. Manage Your Time ©Batom Inc. 2.1. School is a full-time job. And managing your time is important. If you have a \"real\" job after school that you do just for fun (or for some extra spending money), or if you participate in extra-curricular activities (whether school-related or not), keep your priorities in mind: Your education should come first! If you must work (in order to make ends meet), you should realize the limitations that this imposes on your study time. ©Jorge Cham How much time should you devote to studying? A recent survey in the Chronicle of Higher Education suggested that students are not studying enough. So, how much is enough? If you assume that your education is a full-time job, then you should spend about 40 hours/week on it. Figure that 1 academic credit equals about 1 hour. So, if you're taking 15 credits, then you're spending about 15 hours in class. Subtracting that from 40 gives you 25 hours that you should be spending studying at home (or in the library). You should spread that out over the week. Suppose you decide to study Sunday through Thursday evenings, taking Fridays and Saturdays off (from studying, that is). Dividing that 25 hours by those 5 days gives you 5 hours of studying per night. If you think that's too much, then plan on studying in the afternoons, too, or some of Saturday. The above are just rules of thumb. If you're taking a 3-credit independent-study course, but you meet with your instructor only 1 hour/week, then you should add the extra 2 hours to your at-home study time. If you're working to earn some money, you should subtract your work hours from your free time, not from your study time! (If you don't want to do that, then you should consider quitting your job or reducing your course load.) So, for instance, if you are a part-time student taking (say) 3 courses worth a total of 9 credits and working (say) 20 hours per week, then you have 20 hours per week for your coursework (40 hours in a typical work-week minus 20 hours at your job). The 9 credits amount to approximately 9 hours in class. So, 20 – 9 = 11 hours to spend at home studying. That works out to about 2.2 hours (2 hours and 12 minutes, to be overly precise) per day (in a 5-day week, using the assumption about no studying on Fridays or Saturdays), or about 0.7 hours (42 minutes) per course for 3 courses. If that still seems like a lot, consider the difference between high-school courses and college courses. The typical high-school course meets every day, for about 5 hours/week. But the typical college course meets only about 3 hours/week, yet is supposed to be more intensive than its high-school counterpart. That's because in college you're expected to put more of your own time into studying. ©Lynn Johnston Productions Inc. 2.2. Set yourself a grade goal. If you don't meet it, cut down on non-school activities. (If you can't, because you're working for a living, then consider dropping down to part-time schooling.) 2.3.

Take Notes in Class & Rewrite Them at Home Outline and Index: Take Notes Take Complete Notes Use Abbreviations Neatness Doesn't Count Ask Questions & Make Comments Copy Your Notes at Home Don't Take Notes on a Computer Don't Rely on the Instructor's Lecture Notes Further Reading 3.1. Take Notes Good studying at home begins with good notes taken in class. Just as different students may have different learning or studying styles, different teachers have different teaching styles (and often these clash with the students' learning styles!): Some teachers lecture, some lead discussions, some \"facilitate\" individual work (as in a lab), etc. Consequently, different classroom settings will require different note-taking techniques. But the suggestions here are general enough to work in most situations. 3.2. Take Complete Notes The key idea of taking good notes in class is to write down as much as possible. There are several reasons to take notes that are as complete as possible: It will force you to pay attention to what's going on in class. It will keep you awake (!) There will be less that you'll have to remember. Should you concentrate on taking notes or should you concentrate on understanding what you are learning? Paradoxically, I'd err on the side of taking notes, not understanding! Understanding can come later, when you review your notes. But if you have incomplete notes, it will be hard for you to learn what you didn't take notes on. 3.3. Use Abbreviations Taking complete notes will require you to write fairly quickly and, as a consequence, to use abbreviations. Here are some that I use (many of which I borrowed from other students and teachers), to give you an idea of how you can abbreviate. If you send text messages on your cell phone, then you know the sort of abbreviations I'm talking about. Use them when you take notes in class! ABBREVIATION MEANING betw between ccpt concept cd could compn computation compnl computational comp complete dn description fn function h. human ...g (e.g., contg) ...ing (continuing) ...l (e.g., compnl) ...al (computational) lg language mn mean mng meaning ...n (e.g., abbrvn) ...tion (abbreviation) NB: note/note well/nota bene pn proposition prop property re about (from Latin) reln relation qn question ...r (e.g., compr) ...er (computer) shd should s.t. something/sometimes (context should make it clear which you mean) stmt statement thot thought w/ with w/o without wd would wh which & and ∨ or (this is a symbol from logic) ¬ not/negation sign (this is a symbol from logic)possible/possibly (this is a symbol from logic)must/necessary/necessarily (this is a symbol from logic)all/for all/every (this is a symbol from logic)some/there is/there are/there exists (this is a symbol from logic) A related idea is based on a system of shorthand called Speedwriting: There used to be ads in the New York City subway system that read something like this: if u cn rd ths, u cn lrn spdwrtg The key idea in abbreviating is to use abbreviations that will make sense to you. You can put an abbreviation key in the margin of your notebook for any abbreviations that you make up on the spot. 3.4. Neatness Doesn't Count. Yet another key idea of note-taking is that you don't have to be neat! You only have to be legible enough to be able to read your notes a few hours (or, at most, a few days) later. The reason for this will become clear later. 3.5. Ask Questions & Make Comments If you have a question or something comes to mind as you're taking notes, you have two choices: You can contribute to the class discussion by asking your question or making your comment. Or you can jot your question or comment down in your notes. I suggest always doing the latter, but also doing the former as often as possible. One reason that you should always put your question or comment in your notes is so that you won't forget it. You can then always bring it up later, either in class or one-on-one with the teacher or a fellow student. Another reason, of course, is that if you do bring it up in class, it should thereby become part of the day's class notes! One technique that I use to be able to distinguish my own questions or comments from the rest of the notes is to put them in the margin and/or to surround them with big, bold square brackets [like this.] By the way, if you have a question, especially if you need clarification of something that the teacher said or wrote (possibly because it was inaudible or illegible), ask it! Do not be embarrassed about asking it! I can guarantee you that there will be at least one other student in the class (and often many more) who will be extremely grateful to you for having asked the very same question that they were too embarrassed to ask. And they will come to view you as wise and brave for having asked it. (So will the teacher!) 3.6. Copy Your Notes at Home Recall that this section was titled \"Take Notes in Class & Rewrite Them at Home\". The title was not \"Take Notes in Class & Study Them at Home\". Of course you should study your class notes at home; but just (re-)reading them is too passive. One of the themes of this guide is that STUDYING MUST BE ACTIVE. It is all too easy when just reading passively to have your mind wander or even to fall asleep: Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading such notes won't help. And a few days or months after you take them, they may very well be illegible or incomprehensible. Finally, if you don't do something active with your notes, you run the risks of having unorganized notes or of misplacing them. What I suggest is that you study your notes by re-writing them: For each class, buy a separate notebook from the one you take your notes in. I recommend a \"composition\" or spiral notebook, not a looseleaf notebook, for your \"permanent\" (i.e., re-written) notes. Then, as soon as possible after class (preferably that evening or the next), copy your notes into your permanent notebook. The main idea behind re-writing your \"raw\" class notes (besides making them more legible and organized) is that the very act of copying them is one of the best ways of studying them! Further study of your class notes can then be done from these \"cooked\" ones that are neater, more legible, more organized, and more complete. I will suggest ways to do this later. Use this opportunity to fill in gaps from your memory while they are still fresh in mind. You may find that you have questions, perhaps something you missed or don't understand, or even a \"substantive\" question. If so, good! Make a note of your question and ask it in class next time! Use this opportunity to (re-)organize your notes in a more logical or coherent fashion. You could write your permanent notes in an outline form if that seems suitable: You don't have to follow any \"official\" or formal outlining style (e.g., using the I.A.1.(a)(i) format or the (sometimes silly) rule that there must always be at least two subsections, never just one) — after all, these are your notes. Personally, I like to number main ideas (and separate them with a line), using an \"indented bullet\" style for details: 1. Main idea 1 - detail 1 - detail 2 - further detail 2.1 - detail 3 - further detail 3.1 - further detail 3.2 2. Main idea 2 3. Main idea 3 etc. 3.7. Don't Take Notes on a Computer By the way, I do not recommend taking notes on a laptop computer during class. Certainly you should not do this unless you are a very good typist and have \"compiled\" your word-processing or text-editing program into your fingertips. (In any case, typing can be very noisy and disturbing to your fellow students!) Also, typing class notes into a computer file can be inconsistent with my recommendation to re-write your class notes. Rewriting on a computer might have some advantages in terms of keeping track of your notes or, especially, searching them. And, of course, you can edit your computer file later, but editing is not the same as copying, and I am recommending copying as a means to studying (for one thing, it forces you to (re-)read all your notes). Of course, you can copy your raw notes into a neater computer file; this may be a matter of taste, but I find that I have a firmer grasp of what I write if I handwrite it than if I type it. (As Usama Fayyad has said: computers are \"great at bookkeeping but not yet great at recording impromptu ideas, thoughts, feelings. For that, paper is still far superior. You can hold it, fold it, put it in your pocket, look at it again later when it's convenient\" (as quoted in Swerdlow 1999: 130).) Moreover, the main use of your notes should be for summarizing them to make a study guide for exams. In that case, handwritten notes would serve as well as online ones, especially if you're tempted to create the summary merely by cutting and pasting your computer file rather than by rewriting. Worse, you may be tempted to use the computer that you're ostensibly taking notes on to surf the Internet, look at email, or chat with friends. Don't! (For an interesting debate on this topic, see Adams 2006.) For that matter, turn off your computer in class. And your iPod. And your cell phone. And your pager. And anything else that might distract you. For reasons why, see: Bugeja, Michael J. (2007), \"Distractions in the Wireless Classroom\", Chronicle of Higher Education (26 January): C1,C4.

Klass, Perri (2016), \"Why Handwriting Is Still Essential in the Keyboard Age\", New York Times (20 June). 3.8. Don't Rely on the Instructor's Lecture Notes Some instructors provide their own set of lecture notes, often on the Web or in PowerPoint (or some other format). These can be useful, but you should not rely on them. If all you do with them is print them out, maybe read them once, and save them, they are useless, because you are using them passively. You need to treat them just as you would with your own lecture notes: Re-write them! Better yet: Use them to fill in gaps in your own re-written lecture notes, and to check whether you had any mistakes in your own notes. (You may find new material in the instructor's notes that was not discussed in class, or you may find material in your own notes that was discussed in class but did not find their way into the prepared notes.) 3.9.

The first of their \"Six Learning Strategies\" \"is to take notes by hand\" and \"rewrite your notes, by hand\". 4. Study Hard Subjects First & Study in a Quiet Place Study hard subjects first. Each night (or day) when studying or doing your homework, do those subjects first for which you need to be alert and energetic. Leave the easier, or more fun, subjects to later. Study in a quiet place, with as few distractions as possible. Do not listen to music or TV: It is virtually impossible to do two things at once if one of them is studying. (For the evidence on why it is difficult—if not impossible—to do two things at once (called \"multitasking\"), see: Willingham, Daniel T. (2010), \"Have Technology and Multitasking Rewired How Students Learn?\", Ask the Cognitive Scientist, American Educator (Summer): 23–28, 42. When should you study or do your homework? It's tempting to put off your homework to the last minute. There are at least two good reasons to do your homework as soon as possible and not put it off till the evening, when it's not daylight (although you should certainly take a break between the end of the school day and before starting your homework): It's better to get it done and over with, and to leave yourself enough time to do it all. If you put it off, you may find that you have an assignment or two that are going to take you a lot longer than you thought they would. If you start early and get your work done before you relax, you'll have enough time for even those hard assignments (even if it means not having enough time to Facebook or play videogames or read for fun). The general principle is: Don't eat your dessert first! You're more awake during the daytime or after relaxing for, say, an hour or so after classes end, than you will be at the end of the day just before going to sleep. 5. Read Actively & Slowly, before & after Class Outline & Index: Read actively, not passively Read slowly Highlight the text in the margin Make notes in the margin Keep a notebook Read literature quickly and passively the first time Read before and after class 5.1. Read Actively, Not Passively Whatever you have to read — whether it's a text book, a work of fiction, a poem, an essay, an article from a journal or magazine, or even a class handout — read it slowly and actively: With one major exception, you should not read passively. That is, don't just read the text straight through without thinking about what you're reading. If you read without thinking, I guarantee that your mind will eventually wander off, your eyes will eventually glaze over, and you will fall asleep—it's a form of self-hypnosis. So you must read actively. To use computer jargon, you must turn the inert medium of text on paper to an interactive medium, in which you have a \"conversation\" with the text, as you might if you could be talking to the author. 5.2. Read Slowly. \"…an undeniable truth: that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower can be better.\" —Gleick, James (2011), The Information (New York: Pantheon): 404. The first step in reading actively is to read s-l-o-w-l-y. Here is an algorithm (i.e., a procedure) for how to read any text, in any subject, slowly and actively: WHILE there is a next sentence to read, DO: BEGIN { while } Read it, SLOWLY; IF you do not understand it, THEN BEGIN { if } re-read the previous material, SLOWLY; re-read the incomprehensible sentence, SLOWLY; IF you still don't understand it, THEN ask a fellow student to explain it; IF you still don't understand it, THEN ask your Teaching Assistant (TA) to explain it; IF you still don't understand it, THEN ask me; IF you are in an upper-level course & you still don't understand it, THEN write a paper about it (!) END { if } END; { while } Since there is no next sentence (because the Boolean test in the WHILE is false), you've understood the text! For those of you who may not be familiar with how to read structured computer programs such as this one, here's how it goes: In a \"while\" statement, if the initial test is false, then the rest of the statement is not executed. So, if you are at the beginning or the middle of reading a text, there will be a \"next\" sentence, so you do execute the rest of the statement, which says to read that next sentence slowly, etc. However, if you have finished reading the entire text (and, hopefully, have now understood it), then there is no next sentence, so you are finished! (The words in braces, like \"{ while }\", are just computer-programming notation for a comment that is intended for human readers of a computer program but that is ignored by the computer.) This algorithm has three major advantages: It forces you to actively think about each sentence you read before you go on to read the next one. It slows you down, so that you don't read past the point at which you don't understand. This is especially important in mathematical and scientific subjects. It can help you get help from your teacher, because you can show your teacher exactly where you got lost. It is always much better to show your teacher exactly what it is that you don't understand than it is to just say that you don't understand the material. Note that it also provides you an opportunity to interact with your instructors and fellow students! How do you know whether you understand what you've read? Easy: After each sentence, ask yourself \"Why?\" (Pressley & El-Dinary 1992). For more information on slow reading, see: Pressley, Michael, & El-Dinary, Pamela Beard (1992), \"Memory Strategy Instruction that promotes Good Information Processing\", in Douglas J.

Zacks, Jeffrey M.; & Treiman, Rebecca (2016), \"Sorry, You Can't Speed Read\", New York Times (17 April): SR9. 5.3. Highlight the Text in the Margin There are some other tricks for active reading. One, of course, is to highlight important or interesting passages. There are several ways to do this: The worst is to use a yellow highlighting marker (or hot pink, or whatever color you like). The main problem with this is that you will tend to find almost every sentence to be important or interesting. As a consequence, every page will become yellow (or hot pink, or whatever). Not only does this defeat the purpose of highlighting — because if everything has been highlighted, then really nothing has been! — but the pages of your text will become damp, curl up, and be generally messy. This technique can have other problems, too: A slightly less messy, but equally useless, technique is to use a pen or pencil to underline important or interesting passages. I guarantee that you will wind up underlining every sentence on every page, and you will have gained nothing. The technique that I suggest is also susceptible to this problem, but has a built-in way to overcome it, so that you can re-read the text, highlighting different passages each time. The trick is to highlight a passage by drawing a vertical line in the margin. I like to use the right margin and to make my line a right square bracket: ] If you want to make it clear [exactly where the highlighted passage begins or ends,] you can use small square brackets in the text, as I did in this sentence, along with the vertical line in the margin. This way, even if you've slipped into the error of highlighting (i.e., vertical-lining) every sentence on every page, at least you haven't ruined the page. Moreover, when you re-read the text — note that I said 'when', not 'if' :-) — you can then use a different highlighting technique (e.g., underlining) to highlight more important passages. Sometimes, I use double brackets in the margin for this second round of highlighting: ]] and underlining for a third round. (If you must, you could use yellow highlighter for a fourth round.) 5.4. Make Notes in the Margin You should also make notes in the margin of the text (if there's room, and if the text belongs to you). I like to put cross-references in the margin; e.g., if a passage on p. 20 reminds me in some way of a passage on p. 10, I'll write \"see p. 10\" in the margin on p. 20, and \"see p. 20\" in the margin on p. 10. Or I'll put some keyword in the margin if a passage reminds me of some major idea. But now suppose that a few months (or a few years) later, you want to find that interesting passage that related to, say, consciousness; how will you find it? You could, of course, page through the book till you find it, but what I like to do is to make an index of my marginal comments. You can add entries (e.g., Consciousness: 10, 20) to the book's index if it already has one, or use a blank page at the end of the book if it doesn't have an index. 5.5. Keep a Notebook Highlighting has the disadvantage that it can lead you to highlight everything, and margins have the disadvantage that they are often too small for making comments. The best technique for active reading is to keep a notebook. In addition to (or instead of) highlighting a passage, copy it — verbatim — into your notebook. Be sure to begin your notebook with a full citation to the text for use in a bibliography, and be sure to write down the page numbers of each passage that you copy. Then, write down — at length and in detail — your comments on the passage. (I sometimes like to use a pen for the text and a pencil for my commentary.) These notes can then be used later if you write a term paper or research paper that discusses the material in the text. For that purpose, it will be useful to number your notes. I find the following scheme useful: Number each notebook page with a Roman numeral (I, II, etc.), number each quoted passage (or stand-alone comment) with an Arabic numeral (1, 2, etc.), and letter (a, b, etc.) each comment associated with a quoted passage (or stand-alone comment). Then you can refer to each passage with an identifier (like XIV-7-b, i.e., comment b about quotation 7, which comment is located on notebook page XIV) that will enable you to find it later. See below.) 5.6. Read Literature Quickly and Passively the First Time. Earlier, I said that there was an exception to this method of slow and active reading: If the text is a work of literature (a story, novel, play, poem, etc.), then it is often best to read it once all the way through without stopping, just as you would read something for fun, so that you get to know what it's about and can appreciate it as a work of literature. (If there's a recording of it, you might find it helpful to listen to the recording while reading the text. I have found this especially useful for Shakespeare.) Then you can use the slow and active reading techniques for a second (or third, or fourth, or …) reading when you are studying the text. Actually, even for non-fiction, it can be useful to read the text through once, quickly, to get an overview, perhaps making notes if something strikes you, and then doing the slow and active reading techniques when you are studying the text. What about film or video versions? They can be helpful but, in general, of course are no substitute for reading. The exception here is for plays, which are intended to be seen, not (just) read. If you do decide to watch in addition to read, which should you do first? I prefer watching first, reading afterwards. I have almost always been disappointed by film adaptations of favorite texts (because they don't match the mental images that I construct when I read), but I have almost never been disappointed by a text after watching a film adaptation. Besides, if you watch first and read later, the adaptation can help you visualize what you're reading. 5.7. Read Before and After Class Ideally, you should read a text at least twice: Read it (perhaps quickly) before the class in which it will be discussed, so that you are familiar with its contents. Then (re-)read it after class using the slow and active method. If time permits, you can cut corners by only reading it—slowly and actively!—after class. 6. Do Your Homework It should go without saying that you should do your homework and do it on time. Science and math courses (and some others, such as foreign-language courses) often require you to do homework exercises or problem sets. I strongly recommend that you do not simply do the problems and hand them in. Rather, do them on scrap paper, check them over, and then copy them neatly. Turn in the neat copy (and, of course, be sure that your name is on it!). You may even want to duplicate your work in case the teacher loses it (unlikely) or doesn't give it back in time to use it for studying for an exam (this should only happen in rare circumstances, usually just before an exam (when the teacher has a lot of things to do), but it is not unheard of). And don't just write down answers. Write down the problem and the complete solution showing how you arrived at your answer. 7. Study for Exams ©Batom Inc. Outline: Don't study for exams! Manage your time How not to study Make a study outline Write sample essays & do sample problems Make \"flash cards\" Stop studying when you feel confident 7.1. Don't Study for Exams! What? That's right: You shouldn't study only for exams. And you shouldn't study for the sake of exams. You should \"study for learning and understanding\": David Jaffee, \"Stop Telling Students to Study for Exams\", Chronicle of Higher Education (27 April 2012): A35. Henry L. Roediger III, \"How Tests Make Us Smarter\", New York Times (20 July 2014): SR12. But in case you do want to study for that exam, here are some suggestions: 7.2. Manage Your Time The first rule is: Don't cram! Earlier, I discussed managing your time. When you have exams, time management becomes even more crucial. Begin studying about 1 week before the exam. Spend at least an hour each night (or day) studying for the exam in the manner described below. Try to spend the entire night (and/or day) before the exam studying for it. Of course, if you have two exams on the same day, you'll have to split the time in half. For final exams, try to spend as much time as possible studying. Do not be tempted, by any free time that you have during exam week, to do anything other than studying. (If you must take some time to relax, do it after you've done all your studying for the day.) If you have E exams and D days to study for them, spend roughly D/E days studying for each exam. (E.g., if you have 4 exams and 5 days to study for them, spend a little more than 1 day (1.25 days to be exact) studying for each exam.) If you have some free days, then some exams, then some more free days, then some more exams, etc., plan your studying so that you'll spend approximately the same amount of time studying for each exam, making sure that the night (or day) just before an exam is spent studying for it. E.g., suppose you have 2 free days to study before exam #1, then one more free day before exams #2 and #3. Think of each day as having 3 parts: morning, afternoon, and evening. Let's assume that each exam is in only one of these parts (i.e., it's not so long that it extends through 2 of them). Then you might divide your studying time as shown in the chart below. Note that you should not delay studying for exam #3 until after exam #2! Start studying for all exams right away. DAY PART OF DAY WHAT TO DO Day 1 morning study for exam #1afternoon study for exam #2evening study for exam #3 Day 2 morning study for exam #1afternoon study for exam #2 or #3 (or both)evening study for exam #1 Day 3 morning study for exam #1afternoon take exam #1evening study for exam #2 Day 4 morning study for exam #3afternoon study for exam #2evening study for exam #3 Day 5 morning study for exam #2afternoon take exam #2evening study for exam #3 Day 6take exam #3 Moreover, you should distribute your studying, not \"mass\" it all together: \"set aside blocks of time throughout each week to study the content for each class\"; \"massed practive leads to quick learning and quick forgetting, whereas interleaved practice slows learning but leads to much greater retention\" (Dunlosky, John (2013), \"Strengthening the Student Toolbox: Study Strategies to Boost Learning\", American Educator 37(3) (Fall): 12–21). 7.3. How Not to Study Believe it or not, re-reading your textbook has \"little or no benefit\" when you are studying for a test. (Callender & McDaniel 2009; see also John Dunlosky, \"Strengthening the Student Toolbox: Study Strategies to Boost Learning\", American Educator 37(3) (Fall 2013): 12–21.) Most students don't realize this, because they have an \"illusion of competence\" (that is, you think you know the material better than you really do) when they re-read notes and textbooks (Karpicke et al. 2009; Belluck 2011), especially when re-reading passively instead of actively. One method of studying that is better than passive re-reading is the \"read-recite-review\" (\"3R\") method: \"Read the text, set the text aside and recite out loud all that [you can] remember, and then read the text a second time\" (McDaniel et al. 2009). More importantly, you learn better and remember more from repeated testing (from both in-class quizzes and from self-testing at home) than from repeated reading (Karpicke et al. 2009). (So when your instructor gives you lots of quizzes or tells you to memorize basic facts, don't complain! That's the best way to learn and to remember what you learn.) The next few sections give you some suggestions on how to do this. 7.4. Make a Study Outline Use your recopied class notes, together with your highlighted text and notebook, to make an outline of the material. Try to put as much as possible onto the front sides of only 1 or 2 sheets of paper (like those plasticized crib sheets that are often sold in college bookstores). Then do all your studying from these. (You could even combine this outline with \"flash cards\".) 7.5. Write Sample Essays & Do Sample Problems For subjects in which you will be expected to write essays, either \"psych out\" the teacher and make up some plausible essay questions, or get copies of old exams that have real essay questions on them. Then write sample essays. Although the essay questions that you find or make up may not be the actual ones on your exam, you will probably find that much of what you wrote in your sample essays by way of preparation for the exam can be recycled for the actual exam. You will then be in the advantageous position during the exam of not having to create an essay answer from scratch but being able to merely recall the main ideas from a sample that you have already written as part of your studying. For subjects in which you will have to solve problems or write proofs, solve lots of sample problems from your text or from other texts. ( Schaum's Outline Series (McGraw-Hill) books are usually quite good in this regard). How will you know if your answers are correct? The best way is to form a study group of 2 or more fellow students: Solve the same problems and compare answers. If your answers agree, they're probably correct; if not, go to your Teaching Assistant (TA) or teacher. As with slow reading, it's always better when asking for help from a teacher to have a specific problem or question to ask. 7.6. Make \"Flash Cards\" For any subject, you can make a set of \"flash cards\". But I suggest using regular 8 1/2\" x 11\" paper, not index cards. Divide each page in half, vertically. On the left, write a \"question\" that requires an \"answer\", e.g., the name of a theorem, a term to be defined, the statement of a theorem, etc. On the right, write the answer, e.g., the statement of the theorem named on the left, the definition of the term on the left, the proof of the theorem stated on the left, etc. (This could even be your study outline.) Then memorize the questions and answers—but do not simply recite them by heart. Instead, write down the answers: Cover the right-hand side (the answers) with a blank sheet of paper, and write down the answers. When you finish a page, check your work and repeat writing the answers to the questions you missed until you get them all correct. Recent psychological evidence suggests that people learn better by making mistakes than by getting everything correct. So don't worry about getting some answers wrong! (See Roediger III, Henry L.; & Finn, Bridgid (2010), \"The Pluses of Getting It Wrong\", Scientific American Mind 21(1) (March/April): 39–41. Why write, and not merely recite? Because you will have to write the answers on the actual test, so get used to writing them now. (Of course, if it's going to be an oral exam, reciting may be better than writing. Still, one tends to skip details when reciting, especially if you recite silently to yourself, but if you write the answers and have a good memory, then, during an oral exam, you can \"read\" the answers with your mind's eye.) Moreover, there is evidence that the kind of \"self-testing\" that you can do with this technique is one of the best ways to study: \"taking practice tests (versus merely rereading the material to be learned) can substantially boost student learning\", according to John Dunlosky, \"Strengthening the Student Toolbox: Study Strategies to Boost Learning\", American Educator 37(3) (Fall 2013): 12–21. 7.7. Stop Studying When You Feel Confident How do you know when you've studied enough? It's not when you're tired of studying! And it's not when you've gone through the material one time! You should stop only when you get to the point that you feel confident and ready for whatever will be on the exam — when you're actually eager to see the exam to find out if you guessed its contents correctly. 8. Take Exams First, read the entire exam all the way through. For an essay question, do a \"mind dump\": Write down, on scrap paper, brief reminders (keywords) of everything that you remember about the topic of the question. Then develop an outline of your answer. Then write the essay. (With luck, much of the essay can be \"copied from memory\" from the sample essays you wrote when studying.) For an exam with problems to solve or proofs to write, do the easy ones first. When you are all done, review your answers carefully. And, when all of your exams are over, take heed… :-) ©KingFeaturesSyndicateInc. 9. Do Research & Write Essays. Outline: Choose topic carefully Do research Make an outline Write, using your outline Edit Manage your time Some Interesting Online Articles on Writing From For Better or For Worse: 9.1. Choose Topic Carefully Choose your topic wisely. Avoid the two extremes of a topic that is so broad or well-known that there are too many sources of information and a topic that is so narrow or little-known that there is a paucity of information. If you are having trouble choosing a topic, talk to your teacher. 9.2. Do Research Once you have a topic and have found appropriate resource materials, read them slowly and actively, and be sure to keep a notebook. I won't repeat the details of those suggestions here, with one exception: Be sure to carefully record your sources and the page numbers of any quotations, so that you can include them in your final report. 9.3. Make an Outline This stage may require several iterations. You should make an outline and sort your notes into categories that correspond to the main sections of your outline. But which of these should you do first? It doesn't matter. You may have a clear outline in mind, in which case, sorting your notes will be relatively straightforward (though you may find that some notes don't quite fit or that some suggest a section that you hadn't initially thought of). Or you may need to sort your notes first, to see which ones go together, and then create an outline based on the categories you discover during the sorting process. How do you make an outline? The suggestions that follow work for almost anything you have to write. First, write down a handful of main themes that you want to discuss (these will be the categories that you sorted your notes into); describe each using only a few keywords. Decide in what order you want to write about them, and then—on a blank piece of paper—put each at the head of a column, something like this: intro topic1 topic2 topic3 conclusion These will be the main sections of your paper. In addition, you should always have an introductory section and a conclusion or summary section. Next, in each column, write down the main ideas that you want to include, again ordering them and using just a few keywords. These will be your subsections. Under each of these, put the identifying numbers of the items in your notes that you want to include in each subsection. (You may find that you will need to repeat this process recursively for subsubsections, etc. If so, do this when you're ready to write that subsection, not at the beginning. This kind of process is called \"top-down design and stepwise refinement\".) 9.4. Write, Using Your Outline \"How can I tell what I think until I see what I say?\" Once you've got your outline, start writing, using your outline and notes as a guide. Don't spend too much time editing what you write at this stage. Just write. (I should note that some people prefer \"free writing\" , in which you don't spend any time preparing an outline before you write. If that works for you, go for it.) By the way, it's always helpful for keeping track of where you are in your outline, both to you as writer and to your reader, to give each section and subsection a name, as I have done in this document. 9.5. Edit After you've written your first draft, re-read what you wrote, using the method of slow and active reading, and revise (or \"edit\") what you wrote. Then ask a friend to read it and give you feedback. Then revise again, and prepare the final version. 9.6. Manage Your Time ©KingFeaturesSyndicateInc.

Right about now, you're probably asking yourself whether you really have to do all of this. It seems like an awful lot of work. Well, of course, you don't have to do all of it at once. Try various of these suggestions to see what works for you. Try some variations that may better fit your learning style or personal circumstances. But, in the long run, there's no quick and easy road to studying. It is hard work and should take a lot of time. So, do you really have to do all of this? Yes (or things very much like them)—if you want to really learn the material (and get good grades). Finally, for what it's worth, here are some comments from students and others who have tried some of these methods: \"... this is the way you taught me to study years ago and it finally paid off last year!\" (a college sophomore who went from high-school grades in the 70s to a 3.00 average in college) \"Thank you for the guide. It has some great tips! I'm surprised that I use some of the techniques myself. (E.g., I abbrev. and cndnse my notes.) I have one suggestion, though: when reviewing for a test/exam, only study what you aren't familiar with. It reduces studying time and is helpful if you're a last minute person like me. :) Well, that may not work for you, but who knows?\" \"... encourage some study groups! Not 5 in a group, 'cause that will be a crowd, but study environment is as important as studying itself; change of environments is sometimes good to make you study better. Thank you for your helpful hints, and it does help me to notice some of my weaknesses in studying.\" \"I'd like to pass along a bit of technique that worked well for me in just about all my courses. Thinking about the subject matter—often catalyzed by discussion with others—before delving into it was my key to success. After giving it some thought, I wrote out a series of logical, fundamental questions which I sought to answer that would clarify the subject matter. You know, make it perspicuous. I read/listened/watched with those questions in mind, noting as well other points an author/instructor was attempting to make. If my questions (which were fundamental to a clear understanding) went unanswered, I would seek the answers through other written, visual, or aural materials. Visiting an instructor during office hours or asking the question in class was often most helpful. Once I had the basics well in mind, building on them was easy and fun. Studying and learning in this way also helped me to prepare for exams. Clearly, if I could think of a question, there was a good chance one writing an exam might think of it too. The technique is not a panacea for all study-related problems; however, it does set forth a system to build upon in an individualized way. I also suggest a visit to the children's section of the library when revisiting or attempting to master the basics of certain things. Books written at that level, though often oversimplified, present ideas and concepts in a clear and easily understandable form usually lacking in primers written for adults. There's no substitute for laying a good foundation on which to build additional knowledge.\" — Marc L. Ames \"I would like to thank you for the effort made doing this guide....

I always always erred on the latter. I was definitely in the minority. It took me ages to work out why nobody else ever asked questions (or challenged errors). They were just writing stuff down to process later. I have never understood it, it seems so obviously like a wasted opportunity. At that point why go to class at all, you could just get sent notes! reply BenFranklin100 6 hours agoparentI opted for understanding as well. And my grades as an undergraduate suffered because of it. Understanding takes concerted effort over time and traditional pedagogy, especially real-time lectures, are poor at conveying understanding. I wish I had had YouTube back in the day, or at least video recordings of lectures that one could pause and rewind to portions that weren’t understand on the first pass. reply magpi3 4 hours agorootparentYes, I look at note-taking as a skill that essentially is summarizing what you are listening to, writing down questions, etc. It should be an active process, not a passive one. But this is a skill that takes time to cultivate. Writing down what you hear and then rewriting your notes later does accomplish the same task, and it gives you more time to do it. reply danking00 11 hours agoparentprevMost effective learning experience I ever had was reading the relevant book chapter before class, taking some broad notes to structure my understanding, and then asking questions during class when either the lecture didn’t make sense or we reached a confusion I had from reading. I only managed one class like that and only near the end of my undergraduate career. Both earlier in ugrad and in grad school I was way too busy barely staying afloat to be so meticulous about my education. reply uncharted9 3 hours agorootparentThis is the correct way to approach the note-taking vs. paying attention debate. Most of the students (including me in my early undergrad days) come to classes with blank slates. This forces your brain to be in panic mode when encountering new information from the lecturer by either jotting ferociously or not paying attention because, of course, the lecture slides will be posted in Google Drive later, after the lecture is done. For engineering classes, I would rather invest the entire time in the class to focus, ask questions, and read the content from the textbooks if it's standard stuff covered there. The ideal scenario is doing it before class, but even going through textbooks on the same day and creating notes based on them works fine for me. During my pre-undergrad days while preparing for entrance exams, my teachers would ask everyone to just listen to the whole topic while they used to explain on the whiteboard, and only at the very end, after the board was fully covered, would they give everyone 5–10 minutes to jot down the content in their notebooks. I really think that really balances all the classroom learning, but I have never experienced the same type of teaching philosophy elsewhere since then. I also think that a particular type of learning style can't work across subjects. There is no one-size-fits-all. You can't study history the same way you do mathematics. Physics is very different from chemistry, and computer science is definitely different. A lot of universities (anything outside the top 10) in my country really got CS education all wrong. I see kids writing code in their notebooks. Mugging up random information. It's really jarring. reply troupe 12 hours agoparentprevThe most effective use of taking notes is to actively engage with the content by figuring out how to organize it and what to include and what to leave out. Even though the author says to just capture everything, if you are doing it by hand, you are making decisions on what to write and what to skip simply because you can't write as fast as someone talks. One of the reasons taking notes on a computer isn't as good for retaining information is because you CAN probably keep up with how fast a professor talks and capture everything--so you don't end up actively thinking about what is being said. reply felipefar 7 hours agorootparentThis is a great use in the short-term. In the long term, you also need situations where you will apply directly the contents of your note. You can explain the subject to your friends or co-workers, use it as the basis for research that you are yourself doing, or synthesize what you've written down with knowledge coming from other books. This will keep you coming back to your notes, and you'll feel that your knowledge is increasing and getting sharper each time. reply Zambyte 6 hours agorootparentExactly this. Focusing not just on what you write, but how you find what you wrote is very important. I started using Org Roam a bit over half a year ago. My policy with deciding what to store in it is: \"is there a chance I will want to remember this later?\" If yes, I write it down, and link it to something relevant, which allows me to find it later from the backlinks on that relevant note. I thought I had pretty good memory (I still think it isn't bad for a normal human) but I have been surprised fairly often that some tidbit of information that I want is neatly available as an atomic note, and I don't even remember writing it. reply baby 11 hours agoparentprevTook me a while to understand that taking notes is a waste of time, but in France you are taught to go to class and mindlessly just write down EVERYTHING the professor writes on the board. And the professor will just spend 1-2h just writing with 0 interaction. It’s really sad and it’s surprising that we are good at stuff as a nation. Btw this is university for you in France. Maybe we are good as a nation because everything before uni is actually good, and people who are good actually don’t go to uni but to grandes ecoles ? (Equivalent of ivy leagues) reply mathattack 8 hours agoparentprevI found I never went back to notes. Getting ahead is the best path. The one thing worth writing down was exam hints. reply jamilton 6 hours agoparentprevThe line I always heard about that was that just by taking notes you'll remember and process more of the content, even if you don't review them later. I think for some content this was true for me, but it definitely wasn't universal. reply chrisfosterelli 15 hours agoprevThis is a great guide and something I wish I had in my undergrad. I found that I sort of breezed through elementary and high school because I was smart enough to do well enough without any real studying. When I got to university, I had a pretty rough first year as I discovered quickly that 1) that didn't work anymore, and 2) I didn't actually know how to study. I eventually developed most of what's in this guide, but it would've been great to just have someone tell me this instead. reply dehrmann 14 hours agoparentA lot of what makes college different is most of the professors aren't good teachers aren't aren't all that interested in teaching. reply latency-guy2 6 hours agorootparentWell maybe you shouldn't put too much weight on teachers or lectures in the first place. Everything that is being taught is quite likely derived entirely from the textbooks in the syllabus. Lectures are also time limited, littered with people of varying experience asking questions during (if at all), while the person at the front of the class draws or recites with varying quality, worsened by accents, lack of coffee, or pure lack of interest, the person in behind the lectern might even die suddenly (in the middle of a sentence even, n=1 myself). The textbook will probably be far more rigorous than lecture ever was anyway, and you can take whatever speed you want. That formula worked for me for entirety of undergrad, and it was expected of me during my graduate studies. If I had better control of the internet or material on the internet was as good as they are today, I am certain any other student could do the same. reply chrisfosterelli 6 hours agorootparentI agree here too. Grad studies was a new lesson altogether -- not just how to study but how to teach yourself whole topics it would now be assumed you know :) reply kragen 1 hour agorootparentit sounds like you're saying that grad school trains people to be autodidacts reply _dark_matter_ 13 hours agorootparentprevthis really depends on where you go to college. I went to a small liberal arts college (not one of the \"good\" ones), and my profs loved teaching. It was their whole job, they did almost no research (the cs depts research was all \"how to teach cs\" type research). Seeing how other people experienced undergrad, I couldn't be happier. reply a_wild_dandan 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, that and the material growing far more complicated and demanding. I always had peers and online access to excellent teachers for any subject, if the professor wasn’t cutting it! reply lannisterstark 12 hours agorootparentprevThis will be fairly unpopular, but we idolize _all_ teachers too much. Wait - Let me qualify that. Teaching, like all professions, has people who are not good at their jobs or just want to coast through. Hell there are doctors who do just that, despite medicine education taking a huge part of their life - but there are less of them for that reason. Teaching doesn't require as significant year sink as medicine tends to. Not all teachers are good. Some are just atrocious ones with ego, and a lot are there just for the tenure. reply smeej 9 hours agoparentprevI need the version of this guide that's written for those of us who never hit that challenge in school, but got absolutely clobbered in real life by the fact that most success depends on incremental effort over time, not immediate or last-second success. People kept telling me it would happen at the next level of schooling, and I kind of wish it had. At least then I might have learned what to do about it without the risk of \"failure means I have to live outside.\" reply cratermoon 9 hours agoparentprevI hit a wall in the same way, but quite a bit earlier, sometime at the latter end of middle school. It was especially clear in semester-long final projects. I could get through things on a day-to-day basis, often by last-minute effort but sustaining progress on something that was so far in the future (initially) tripped me up. I wished my classes in middle/high school had adopted the technique of requiring progress steps throughout the semester. reply aswanson 10 hours agoparentprevSame. The thing I had to learn very late is that you have to do the homework. Always. That's something I never had to do up until college. reply Al-Khwarizmi 10 hours agoprevInteresting read. I can say that I have been a very successful student (graduated with best GPA in class, did a PhD, now a professor) and I did things very different to what's described here. Goes to show that different people might need very different studying styles. Calculating hours of study per week beforehand? No way. I studied what was needed. If a semester was easy I studied less, if a semester was hard I studied more. I only counted hours after the fact (sometimes) to track progress. But IMO the variance in course difficulties is so large that if you allocate a constant amount of time to studying, you will fall short sometimes and study too much other times (yes, one can study too much: studying when it's unneeded and you'd rather be reading a novel, doing sports, having a drink, or whatever is wasting time). Rewriting notes? No way. Notes took in class were the final version (at most, I could add things that I missed, but I never rewrote anything). I do concur with the author in that I did prioritize taking notes over immediate understanding - my notes were quite appreciated by the class because I took down practically everything (using a fountain pen helped!). Highlighting text, be it with markers, underlining, etc.? Never. And what I consider to be the key that made my study work (this was mostly a post hoc realization): I used a variant of what the post calls \"read-recite-review method\" (I didn't know the method formally, this is just what I did spontaneously) but where \"recite\" wasn't just reciting, but explaining the material to an invisible audience, aloud, while walking around the room, with a quite dramatic tone, gesticulating, and in English (whereas the material was written in Spanish). When I started to do that I think the main reason was just to avoid boredom (which of course is no small matter when studying), but later I realized that needing to explain the material, and especially translating it to a different language in real time, is a way to force your brain to understand it and not just merely recite in automatic mode. Not sure if it would work for other people, though... and it does have the drawback that you need to have a room for yourself with some privacy. I hardly ever studied in libraries :) reply sandworm101 16 hours agoprevHow to study: Start by actually doing it. I see people spend more time on study planning than on actually learning. Others spend hours trying to determine what will or won't be tested rather than just learning the material. See Arnold Rimmer. reply lordnacho 16 hours agoparentBut that is the actual problem. It's like telling people how to lose weight. Eat less. It's true, and it doesn't help. How do you actually get yourself to do it? What are the blockers, and how does one deal with them? reply tomcam 16 hours agorootparentNot sure if this helps, but I grew up in a bad place and had some unpleasant jobs. For me, the thinking was always straightforward. Studying is free, moves me forward professionally, and can therefore keep me from falling backwards to those times. I have always had horrendous sleep problems so studying is just physically tough. But it beats the shit out of being poor or harassed by idiot bosses. Retired now, but his has helped me for all 40+ years of my programming & business careers. reply sankumsek 15 hours agorootparentSure - but imagine someone doesn't have your drive or experiences of studying being an opportunity climb upwards. IMO, individuals that are lacking your desire + intentionality would benefit from this. reply user_7832 14 hours agorootparent> but imagine someone doesn't have your drive Sometimes, the lack of drive is because it's not something you really want to do. Caveat: while not super common, in my case the \"not having the drive despite being x/y/z good traits\" just turned out to be undiagnosed ADHD. Dopamine is strongly linked with willingness to do tasks and is affected in ADHD. Of course this isn't the case for everybody, but if you/someone is chronically late/procrastinates, is very unorganized/messy, struggles to finish tasks etc - it's worth googling executive dysfunction at the very least, and then perhaps talking with your doctor. reply tomcam 15 hours agorootparentprevWell I started out not being motivated to study, and not knowing how. I had to cobble these skills together as an adult. reply ksd482 15 hours agorootparentprevGood point. And agree that it’s insufficient. We must understand the why behind it and also learn how to create a supportive environment. For instance, remove all the bad food from sight and replace with good ones. Put on shoes and active wear before even deciding to do some exercise. And many many other tricks.. reply dustincoates 16 hours agoparentprevIt's a really common problem with language learners. They'll spend so much time deciding what is the \"right\" language, what are the \"best\" resources, and how to plan out their study to learn as quickly as possible. And they learn so much less than the people who just get started. There's nothing wrong with a little bit of \"learning to learn,\" but you have to be on guard against using it to do the hard work. reply sandworm101 16 hours agorootparentI used to teach a 300-level class that had many ESL students. They asked me how best to learn proper english. I told them to watch BBC comedies. Not antiques roadshow but Blackadder, Blacks Books and The Thick of It. Or anything with Attenborough.

Also, experts are the worst teachers, they are far removed from being in your shoes and do not provide the empathy or the correct scaffolding to start newcomers down the path of understanding a topic. The biggest success for pedagogy impact is study groups, and tutoring while or immediately after learning something (the accountability of needing to teach someone bumps.your motivation to understand the nuances, plus the act of teaching helps you remember) reply satellite2 9 hours agoparentIn my experience those are pretend experts, that are either shy, either also not comfortable with the material. The one that really understand the material don't hesitate to tell you their real understanding and thoughts pattern even if those are not strictly correct and could never be written down in a publication. But that's exactly how you catch the deep understanding fast. If the prof. is not giving you that it'll take much more time to get an in depth understanding of the course. reply ford 14 hours agoprevMy pet peeve in college was people who \"studied\" for \"12 hours yesterday\" but never had more than 12 minutes of continuous focus.

We never did any crazy hazing or many forced events except the week before initiation which was the first week of the following semester, well outside of test time.

A lot of these points were critical things I had to learn the long way in college. Rewriting notes is a huge one for me. > 3.7. Don't Take Notes on a Computer The amount of notes I typed up in my personally designed note taking format with custom scripts for compiling them into static sites and PDF documents, all to never look at them again is astounding. The best notes I ever had were the ones I wrote on paper. Just being able to draw picture of what you're learning makes typed notes so much harder. Especially in computer science, there are so many things I'd want to draw. Drawing a B Tree on paper is so much easier and better than having to do ASCII art on the fly while your professor is going to the next slide.

The questions themselves are still short, 1-2 sentences, but the context for answering those questions is not. The \"trick\" for me on tests like that was to skim the reading and note key items (dates, names, topic terms) and then review the questions. Most of the time I could answer them directly, but if not I could go back to the reading and find the answer. Having skimmed it, I could jump straight to the relevant sentence(s). reply magpi3 4 hours agoprevI agree with everything the author said. Also, I would add that if you are taking a course that requires writing, make that writing a daily practice, or at least a few times a week. Make time for it and do it. I used to take courses where the final project was a writing assignment, and I had to change my habits (from reading everyday to suddenly a burst of intense writing) at the last minute to accommodate the task. It's very hard to make this shift.

The article mentioned learning styles not being proven; in fact, one can argue the opposite is true; people who learn with mixed, varied content perform the best. But we also like the learning type which is comfortable for us; this boosts motivation. The problem is that studying students across a whole semester and multiple courses rarely happens, and studies focusing on how varying the learning content within a 10 minute window changed how much students learned, does not replicate the value of being familiar with a learning content style, nor the cost that things within it might blur. There are pros and cons to sticking to one style; variation certainly helps in the short term. - enjoyment(or motivation) matters. Because almost every student reports procrastinating early in the Semester (95% in one study, and I guess the other 5% didn't fill in the form). A real issue with learning research is that it tends to replicate exam period, exam conditions, and not the 60-80% of students lives where many put off studying, gently attend lectures, socialise and work between semester exam seasons. It is in that time that results are predetermined, not in the final weeks. That's what my learning app for students focuses on, and achievable regular cadence of studying in that period; motivating and fun enough to engage before your peers are. It splits content like your lectures up into memorable emoji-represented exercises, and then sends you notifications using the emoji for one exercise each day, to get you to just study a little each day. This has big downstream effects. - the quality of learning content is as variable as the quality of laptops; some is poor. Key concepts like the \"Minimum Information Principle\" - that questions based on building definitions, linking concepts and memorizing should have only one short clear answer - are almost necessary if you want to learn a serious amount without forgetting what matters and blurring answers. Long answers, although they seem better because of detail, will drop your grades as you accidentally confuse or forget part of them, as compared to separating them into different or say follow up cards. reply sh4rks 15 hours agoprevTwo words: spaced repetition reply yoyopa 14 hours agoparentit's better to just learn it the first time and remember it. that way you don't have to repeat. that way you don't have to repeat. reply kragen 1 hour agorootparentmost things you have to rehearse or practice, or you'll forget them. only a few things (foods that make you vomit, for example, or neighborhoods where you get mugged) can be learned from a single exposure with no later mental rehearsal. better encoding helps a lot, but it's not a panacea reply Denzel 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m not sure why you’re being downvoted. You are correct. Learning is made up of two processes: encoding and retrieval. Encoding dominates retrieval in that the better your memory is encoded the shallower your forgetting curve is such that you need less repetitions or possibly none at all. Combining both: better memory encoding techniques and spaced retrieval is the holy grail. People who employ both feel like superhuman. For example, you can encode knowledge of a book with a mind map following specific principles and then schedule either a spaced cued recall with image occlusion or a spaced free recall or a mixture of cued/free by occluding large portions of the mind map. In my experience though, I rarely need spaced repetition for knowledge I’ve encoded with a mind map. I have almost perfect recall of the map and an understanding of what it represents many weeks later with no repetition. reply vineethkm 6 hours agorootparentprevIs it the same as some call it Active Recall? reply ipaddr 15 hours agoparentprevspaced repetition reply lwhalen 15 hours agorootparents p a c e d r e p e t i t i o n reply spacebuffer 15 hours agorootparents p a c e d repetition repetition reply cratermoon 10 hours agoprevHow should I study this \"How to Study\" guide?

And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is. > I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to. ... > Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things when the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what they'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the way to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates, had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking the test. i'm not sure all the advice here is even good for hacking the test, though. taking notes in lecture, for example; when i've tried that, i've missed most of what the lecturer was saying because i was distracted by the notes. i figured that the people who were writing instead of asking questions must just be a lot smarter than i was, to be able to understand the lecture even though they were busy writing, until i saw that i got better grades on the tests than they did (a bad measure, but it was their target measure) if you want to have a complete, undigested copy of the lecture, probably you should film it on your phone instead of playing court reporter. on the other hand, if you are playing court reporter, you should definitely study shorthand first, gregg or pitman rather than speedwriting. on the gripping hand, if you want a complete, undigested explanation of some body of knowledge, you should check out this amazing invention this jeweler guy made out of a wine press, i think his name is gutenbag or something, it can copy down an entire page of lecture notes in a couple of seconds, hundreds of times faster than a scribe in-person lectures are a precious opportunity to ask an expert in the field questions about things you don't understand; don't waste them on stenographically reproducing a textbook you can just download. the syllabus usually tells you what the lecture was about (and, if not, you can devote two minutes to writing down one line at the end), and if you really internalize the points being made, you won't have any trouble applying them i'm a huge fan of taking notes; i take about a page of notes per day as part of my own study strategies. i just don't do it during lectures another difficulty with the strategies outlined here is that they depend on being able to evaluate this boolean IF you do not understand it, THEN but determining whether you understand something is one of the most difficult things about learning! you can't rely on your feelings when you read it; those mostly stem from familiarity. asking 'why?' as suggested is a little better, but it's common for people to accept weak reasons for statements they're already predisposed to believe (for example, because they're familiar). instead, you must try to apply it. one approach is working out possible causes ('why?') and consequences, as well as possible causes and consequences of the negation; but often you can be more focused, because in many cases you are learning a particular thing in order to gain a particular ability. you learn about 'if' statements, for example, in order to be able to write a computer program that uses them (if not to pass a test); so, attempting to write such programs is often better than asking yourself 'why does the if statement in c have parentheses around the condition?', which is not something you can answer—at least, easily, as a novice programmer, or, possibly, at all, given that thompson chose to omit them in golang. (considering that question as you're writing a compiler can illuminate syntax design tradeoffs!) ideally, you would do this before the lecture, so that when the lecturer is explaining the concepts you were attempting to apply, you know what questions to ask. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39330756 points out that ideally you would read the relevant textbook material before the lecture. while i agree that this ought to be ideal, i'm reluctant to give advice i haven't actually tried myself adding marginalia, on the other hand, is an excellent idea, just as suggested here, so the advice here isn't all bad with respect to cramming, a big problem with the schooling system is that it incentivizes cramming on many levels. (just after saying 'don't cram', this text advises you on exactly how to cram.) taking one semester of, for example, greek, involves spending perhaps 50 hours in class and 70 hours studying outside class; if you spend 120 hours studying greek spread over many years, you will have a lifelong working greek vocabulary of thousands of words. by contrast, if you spend 120 hours studying greek crammed into a single semester, then never use it again, you will forget even most of the alphabet within five years. memorably, i had forgotten even 'ουχ', the greek word for 'not' consequently, almost all the time spent studying in school is wasted, in the sense that it doesn't give the students any new intellectual powers; the temporary gains in capabilities are quickly lost, as the students recede to their previous level, like flowers for algernon. this observation is so commonplace that it fails to provoke the appropriate level of existential horror if your objective is learning rather than earning grades, advice like 'do not be tempted, by any free time that you have during exam week, to do anything other than studying' is highly counterproductive. to the extent that you study at all during exam week, your exam grades will be unrealistically inflated and will overstate your real level of knowledge, destroying the utility of the exam as an assessment of your lasting understanding. failing some exams will enable you to repeat the classes again next semester so you can study the material you didn't understand in more depth obviously this is terrible advice if you want to graduate, or even stay in grad school, but just as obviously, it's what you'd do if you were using the exams for learning rather than to obtain credentials to flourish in front of the ignorant a piece of advice that really ought to be in here, but isn't, is to teach the material you've learned to someone else. another very useful strategy is to get someone else to teach it to you in a one-on-one tutoring session, which will increase your performance by about two standard deviations (the well-known 'bloom's 2-sigma problem'). wealthy and powerful people can get experts to tutor them thus, and have been doing so for millennia. large parts of grad school also usually consist of teaching material you supposedly already know and one-on-one apprenticeship. the rest of us have to make do with asking questions in open lecture, meeting with other students to do exercises together, going to the kinds of parties where people talk about the stuff they studied last semester, and maybe help from family members who already know it. if you have those opportunities, don't waste them reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Edit: for visitors from Hacker News, and anyone else who is curious, here is the video that this list came out of The web matters We work on Svelte because we believe that the web is a critically important technology, and that its continued survival is not guaranteed. Optimise for vibes People use Svelte because they like Svelte. They like it because it aligns with their aesthetic sensibilities. Instead of striving to be the fastest or smallest or whateverest, we explicitly aim to be the framework with the best vibes. Don't optimise for adoption We're not trying to be the most popular framework, we're trying to be the best framework. Sometimes that means making choices that we believe in but that go against the grain of web development trends. HTML, The Mother Language HTML is a really good language for describing UI. Svelte augments HTML in a way that makes it a really good language for describing interactive UI. Most frameworks are JS-centric, because JS is the most powerful language. But then they find themselves jumping through hoops to make it feel like you're writing HTML. We think both options are valid, but the HTML-first approach ends up feeling more natural. Embrace progress There is a tendency in the web developer community towards a harmful form of pessimistic nostalgia — the idea that things were better in the prelapsarian age before bundlers, TypeScript, client-side routing and other trappings of modernity. This is nonsense. As a community our default position is one of optimism about technology — the platform is getting better, our tools are getting better, our devices are getting better, and if we embrace that fact we can make better stuff. And when other frameworks introduce new ideas like signals or server components, we look at them with interest and jealousy, and try to work out how we can incorporate good ideas, instead of resting on our laurels. There is always room for improvement. Numbers lie Lighthouse has broken the brains of a generation of web developers. We have replaced good judgment with subservience to metrics that were only ever intended to be used as a diagnostic tool. Goodhart's Law states that When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure and this is very true in web development. Numerical rigour is good, and we pay attention to the various numbers, but when designing Svelte we think qualitatively, not quantitatively. Magical, not magic There's a subtle line between something feeling magical, and something feeling like magic. We want Svelte to feel magical — we want you to feel like a wizard when you're writing Svelte code. Historically I think Svelte went too far into magic territory, where it's not 100% clear why things work a certain way, and that's something that we're rectifying with Svelte 5. Dream big 'Choose the right tool for the job' is sensible but boring advice. It makes us small in our ambitions. I want us to dream bigger. I don't want to feel like my tools can't handle evolving requirements, or that if I want to dabble in a new field I need to learn an entirely new way of working first. Even if it turns out to be unachievable, I find it valuable to ask the question 'what would it take for SvelteKit to be the best framework for any app?', whether it's purely static content, or a realtime multiplayer app, or an offline-first productivity app, or even something built for an augmented reality headset. No-one cares Most people do not care about frameworks. They just want to build something cool, and Svelte is for those people too. So when we design things we need to think about the people who haven't read the docs in a while, if at all, and don't care about things like fine-grained rendering or configuring their build tool. This means that things need to be intuitive, that we shouldn't need to worry about manual optimisations like memoisation, that we should have as few APIs as possible, and that things need to be discoverable — for example you should be able to hover over a rune and get a link to comprehensive documentation. This also informs our approach to documentation and tutorials — it should be possible to build what you want by just learning the concepts that you need, and worrying about the other stuff for another day. Design by consensus Svelte is a community-driven and consensus-led project. It's important that the community — that's you — has a stake in the project's future. Many of Svelte's best ideas originated outside the core team. When we introduce new plans, we want to communicate them openly and provide everyone with good opportunities to offer their feedback. Those of us who work on the project every day have a vision for what kind of thing we want it to be, but we don't want to foist that vision on people against their will. And so while we can't get unanimous agreement on every change, we can at least say that dissenting voices have been heard and considered. 220 183 5 11 27 333 23 25 Replies: 12 comments · 21 replies Oldest Newest Top Indyandie @Rich-Harris How do you imagen sveltekit will embrace the no-one cares tenet?

Working on a design system where we want every component to accept a baseline of props. Will the $props rune make that possible? Any examples? eddiemcconkie @AlanBreck sure! Here's a REPL with a couple examples. If you want every component to accept a baseline of props, you can define an interface with TypeScript, and then extend that interface within each component. In the example, the circle and rectangle components both have color and stroke props, but the circle also has a radius and the rectangle also has width and height. A really handy use case, though, is if you want to extend the functionality of an existing HTML element, like a button, you can extend the HTMLButtonAttributes type provided by Svelte. This is much easier to do in Svelte 5, compared to Svelte 4. 1 AlanBreck Thank you! What about from a runtime perspective? Will the $props rune help determine what props are available for a component during runtime, though? eddiemcconkie Not totally sure on that one!

Which is perfectly fine, a framework can't please everyone. HTML is not the mother language - It's actually pretty terrible for describing dynamic user interfaces. This is why JS solutions are so appealing. If HTML is so magical why do they need a fancy template language? Magical, not magic - I really don't want it to feel magical either. I like explicit behavior and I think that is my problem with the whole wrap everything in observables approach. It's too magical. No one cares - The countless blogs, posts, and communication around frameworks implies that yes, developers do indeed care. Details are important. You can't waive away concepts like memoization because they need to be used in the right context. There's no one size fits all solution to caching. reply jmull 16 hours agoparentI'm not a big fan of HTML itself, but I do think svelte is right to focus on it for specifying UI. That's because HTML is the native language for describing UI in the browser. No matter what you use to specify UI, you have to understand how it translates to HTML to use it in the browser (and how HTML translates back, for debugging). The further your UI specification language deviates from HTML the harder that it. Of course, there are plenty of people using various frameworks that don't really understand HTML or how the code they write translates to it. But they end up with crappy web sites and bugs they don't know how to fix and various other compromises and frustrations. reply nightski 15 hours agorootparentI hear you, but at the end of the day it isn't really targeting HTML. Not when it looks like this - {#if answer === 42} what was the question? {/if} reply jmull 14 hours agorootparentYou're just pointing out that svelte isn't 100% the same as HTML... That is true... but of course, if you wanted 100% HTML, you aren't looking for a framework at all. The approach in svelte is that you write the HTML parts of your app in HTML. It sounds almost silly to say -- that should almost be a silly circular statement -- but with some popular frameworks you write the HMTL for your app in something sorta like HTML but with various syntactic and semantic differences. (You also write most of your UI logic in Javascript or typescript. The amount of syntax that is svelte-specific is pretty small, though semantically, the Javascript you write for the UI is built on the svelte concepts.) reply spankalee 15 hours agorootparentprevSure it is, all the rest of the markup is HTML. Just because it's an extension of HTML doesn't mean it's still not very HTML. reply nightski 15 hours agorootparentThe same argument could be said of JSX though. reply jmull 14 hours agorootparentSure... but there are degrees of closeness to HTML and the closer to HTML it is, the less translation you have to do and the easier it is to deal with. That is, the closer to HTML the better. Plain javascript is a crappy way to represent HTML because both the syntax and semantics are different (and sometimes there are conflicts, like with \"class\"). JSX is better than plain javascript because the syntax is closer, but the semantics are still Javascript, and there are still a number of differences you need to work through. svelte is even better, because the HTML parts are strictly character-by-character the same as HTML, but you still need to know the syntax of a few escape mechanisms. If there were a way to improve significantly on svelte then I'd be all for it. (Maybe HTMX? I'm skeptical of the approach of putting a network round-trip into every UI interaction, but they sure have nailed down the HTML aspect of it.) reply nightski 13 hours agorootparentI'm not buying it. Svelte's template language also has different syntax/semantics from HTML as well - arguably just as much. The JSX parts are character for character the same as HTML as well, except for the class/className distinction (which if you have used Preact it does not have that issue). reply scotty79 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's html plus adhoc behavior description language. Behavior does not belong in HTML. You shouldn't have full programming language in HTML. And if you do, at least use existing language not make your own. Since all of this is client side (and display: none; is the best you can do in terms of not revealing everything to the user anyways) you don't even need any behavior language in HTML. Just set classes to elements and manipulate them with the framework from outside. reply foota 15 hours agorootparentprevSure, you should understand how your html will render, but expressing logic and handlers etc., in the html is just painful to me. reply immibis 7 hours agorootparentCheck out the examples. Logic is expressed in Javascript inside tags, just like vanilla web dev. reply blowski 16 hours agorootparentprev> HTML is the native language for describing UI in the browser In the same way that assembler is the native language for giving instructions to the CPU. In practice, it is of zero importance, because there are powerful abstractions built on top of it, with wonderful benefits once you’re building anything more complicated than one-page documents. reply jmull 14 hours agorootparentThat's not the same because the abstraction a mature computer language provides is nearly complete (not totally complete, of course, but the situations where you ought to go digging through machine code or lower are pretty rare). Outside of games, almost all the frameworks people use don't try to do that -- you are essentially trying to write HTML, but using the syntax of a different language, or each HTML thing in a thing from a different language. (Flutter is the exception -- it really does try to provide a complete abstraction, though it's certainly not without its tradeoffs.) reply nine_k 14 hours agorootparentprevAbstractions are great, as long as you understand their performance implications. Some are essentially free, some are surprisingly costly if you hold them wrong. Sadly, there's no way around understanding HTML and CSS when you need to troubleshoot what a high-level framework built for you. (Or maybe there is! Render everything using WebGL, the way Flutter does, and Flash did before it. But it's a different kettle of fish.) reply Charon77 8 hours agorootparentThat is what's called a leaky abstraction. Think, how often do you write a javascript code and think to yourself to debug it by understanding the underlying assembler code. I'd guess it's nil. But abstractions to html leaks a lot. Leaky abstractions are never good as now you have to think about your cool framework and the underlying library. reply amadeuspagel 14 hours agorootparentprevOpen the browsers dev tools and you see HTML. Read MDN and you see HTML. Constantly translating back and forth between that and another language isn't worth it. reply Aerbil313 13 hours agorootparentThough if there was a better language to describe the UI which is as performant, widely supported and documented as HTML, I can easily see people using it. Maybe someone will start that project today based on my comment, and a decade later browsers will integrate it natively because it's such a success and everyone is using it :). reply bl4kers 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's quite important for accessibility. reply threatofrain 14 hours agorootparentI've found that web accessibility often calls for nice templates and abstraction, not less, because you often need to do some dynamic rewriting. For example, in a world where components are embedded into different places on a website and where users might submit rich text content, you have to rewrite their headers (h1...h6) to fit with accessibility guidelines. reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agorootparentprevproblem is, the most important \"abstractions\" for describing the UI are not built \"on top of\" HTML, but along side it (CSS and to a limited degree JS). the relationship between contemporary \"frameworks\" and HTML is not like that of C and assembler or even Rust and assembler. It is more like that of a driver of a vehicle that has each of a gasoline, electric and steam powered motor, and must constantly pick which one to use for a given situation (sometimes two and occasionally all three). reply spankalee 15 hours agoparentprev> HTML is not the mother language - It's actually pretty terrible for describing dynamic user interfaces. I disagree a lot on HTML here - it's a pretty fantastic way of describing a render and layout tree, so much so that people are embedding HTML-like syntax in programming languages because the syntax is better than what the language already has to offer. To paraphrase something I've heard: JSX proves that HTML actually won. And you can see this because even in a language with concise object literals like JS, a markup based syntax is nicer. There are template systems where you write objects, and I find them cumbersome and they're not very popular. But markup is king, whether it's in JS like JSX or Lit-like tagged template literals, or in an HTML-like file like Angular, Vue, or Svelte. They all share a markup-based syntax. > If HTML is so magical why do they need a fancy template language? Note that Rich doesn't say that HTML is magical. He says it's good, which it undeniably is. It describes elements with attributes and children, which happens to be exactly the structure you need for the vast majority of UI widget concepts. The reason you need a fancier template syntax is that while HTML is good it isn't perfect. HTML doesn't have a dynamic binding syntax (though standards is working on that with Template Instantiation) or conditionals, and attributes are underpowered. So template systems generally add those things. Whether it's JSX, Svelte, lit-html, Angular, etc... they share those common enhancements. The only real big disagreement is whether you embed the logic in HTML or the HTML in JS. It's not even that fundamental of a difference. I prefer HTML-in-JS myself (note: I'm on the Lit team) because JS already has binding syntax, expressions, control flow; because the data is already available in JS; and because JS has a module system and you can do all the things without forking a language or a build step. But having been on the Polymer side too, which is logic-in-HTML, I know that a lot of people prefer HTML syntax and that to some it's more clear how it maps to the DOM created on the page, simply due to syntax similarity. That's fine. But it's really all variants of HTML in the end. reply spankalee 15 hours agorootparentAlso, these differences in syntax and opinion are why I vehemently support and work on web components. You shouldn't have to have two incompatible silos of UI building just because of some frankly minor differences in preferences. Component authors and component users should be able to seamlessly interoperate which disagreeing about such trivial things. reply codeflo 14 hours agorootparentprev> JSX proves that HTML actually won. While I think that might be true, similarly, JSX proves that for the dynamic parts of the template, you want a real programming language. reply scotty79 12 hours agorootparentI'd say that it's better to use real programming language, but you shouldn't use it in JSX beyond the simplest statements like ifs and loops. Mixing any logic beyond that with HTML makes a mess of both. I'm personally a fan of minimalist templating engines that provide only simple loops and conditionals so that template has to receive prepared data tree which is created by the actual programming language first and passed into the template. reply lenkite 6 hours agorootparentprevI personally agree - mileage definitely varies with people. Prefer markup languages over code for describing user-interfaces any day. Find myself quite comfortable with XAML and struggle with SwiftUI. reply Hugsun 14 hours agorootparentprevI suspect that the dominance of HTML is largely due to it being the only browser native markup language. Crucially, the browsers' dev tools always show HTML and having an obvious mapping from there to your code is hard to beat. I personally dislike HTML due to the verbosity. I prefer hyperscript. reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agorootparentprev> I disagree a lot on HTML here - it's a pretty fantastic way of describing a render and layout tree, In the context of the discussion, that would imply that \"a render and layout tree\" is a good way to describe a UI. That too is subject to serious questions. reply spankalee 9 hours agorootparentYes, I would claim that. What major, non-game, UI stacks out there aren't structured that way? reply patcon 16 hours agoparentprevI am not a svelte user, but I really like these principles. I feel very different than you, but I am sincerely glad you have clarity and that you better understand what YOU are looking for :) having said that, we'll likely end up happily working on different things in different pastures reply pier25 13 hours agoparentprev> describing dynamic user interfaces GUIs are essentially 2d scene graphs. Basically you need to describe a tree of hierarchical relationships. I agree HTML is not great for the dynamic part and the reacitivity but it's the lingua franca of the web. Why reinvent some new DSL when you already have one that was already designed to represent a scene graph. reply amelius 16 hours agoparentprev> Magical, not magic The problem with magical is that bugs and performance issues will make you feel like you're dealing with a bad spell and there's no logical solution. reply furyofantares 15 hours agorootparentI feel like this phrase is causing confusion and the distinction the author is trying to make is clear in their mind but very unclear to read. I'm not sure but I think the distinction being made is \"not magic\" means you're expected to be able to understand how and why something works. And \"magical\" means it should be surprisingly easy to do what you want. reply blackoil 6 hours agoparentprevYes, I also don't see the charm. JS/TS are more expressive, you can have composition and modular code natively. Also JSX is 99% HTML. With HTML first solutions, we sprinkle it with some # language which is neither simpler nor as expressive. It looks simple in toy examples, but for large projects you end up with worse structure. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agoparentprevI agree, I'm not going to learn yet another DSL for describing basic programming constructs when I can just...use a programming language itself. The lack of TypeScript and LSP support for quite a few of these DSLs is also very annoying, you're basically reinventing new tooling for every new framework. reply shdh 13 hours agoparentprevHave used: Angular, Vue, Polymer 1 and 2, React Svelte is by far my favorite framework of the lot. It’s also the most productive for me. reply hpeter 15 hours agoparentprev\"HTML is not the mother language\" You don't need js to create a website, you only need HTML.

Imperative Delphi code from early 2000s or indeed Turbo Pascal code from 1995 will run circles around HTML any day of the week and twice on Sundays. reply hpeter 15 hours agorootparentMy browser can't run Delphi or Turbo Pascal. reply WeAddValue 15 hours agorootparentSo, like an election in Russia, there's only one candidate in the race? reply troupo 15 hours agorootparentprevI was responding to this: \"There's literally nothing better than HTML for UI.\" In general that is false statement. In particular, when it relates to browsers, HTML is the local minimum of what can be done to describe the \"UI\". Because HTML (well, DOM) is the only thing to describe the UI in the browser, and it's abhorrently awful. It can barely describe a page with static text and some images (and even then tools like Lighthouse will warn you that \"you have too many elements on the page\" if you dare go beyond 100 or so paragraphs). For the actual UI (yes, UI: complex layouts, interactions, dynamic parts, states, hundreds of complex interactable objects) HTML is unbelievably incredibly bad. Unfortunately that's the only thing you have running in the browser [1] [1] Well, there's canvas (Google Docs switched to canvas because of limitations of the DOM etc.) and WebGL (pretty much every in-browser graphics program out there). But they suffer from having to implement literally everything from scratch. Edit. Just to show how inane \"HTML is superior to everything is\", here it is barfing at my static web site that only contains text and images (and a total of 9 Youtube and maps embeds): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GF__tHjXgAAZGUA?format=jpg&name=... Yes. It chokes on the insane number of .... 943 elements with a maximum depth of 8. Apropos of nothing, here's a screenshot of a highly dynamic interface like Ableton Live with hundreds of dynamic elements https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/11/CleanShot-2023-11-15-at... that the \"technical superior\" HTML would not even be able to represent, much less render. In reality it's very hard to find anything that is inferior to HTML when it comes to representing and rendering UIs. reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agorootparentEven after all that, you still haven't made explicit the thing that needs to be explicit for any of this to make any sense: \".... for UI *IN A BROWSER*\" I know it's convenient to forget the millions of us who spent years and continue to spend hours implementing UIs outside of a browser context, but it certainly doesn't feel very polite. reply CharlesW 12 hours agorootparentI don't think anyone's trying to be impolite or diminish What Came Before, but HTML is used for lots more than websites and browsers. (Examples that come to mind are email, desktop and mobile apps, ebooks, and digital signage.) reply troupo 11 hours agorootparentYes. Unfortunately we've not inly settled for one of the worst systems, but we additionally further settled for limited subsets of it as well (email, ebooks) reply troupo 11 hours agorootparentprev1. I've already answered about \"in the browser\" 2. Even in the browser it's the worst possible system 3. The original comment I was replying to didn't make any references to \"in the browser\", and explicitly talked about things like QML and XIB which are very much not in the browser. reply PaulDavisThe1st 10 hours agorootparentSorry, somehow I really misread your comment. Not sure how I was so wrong in my reading. Needless to say I agree with everything you've written, and also appreciate the use of a DAW screenshot to make the point. reply troupo 3 hours agorootparentNo worries :) DAWs have now become my go to example of complex interactive UIs :) reply immibis 7 hours agorootparentprev\"There's literally nothing better than HTML for UI\" and \"There's literally nothing better than HTML for UI in my browser\" are two different statements; anyway, until relatively recently there was XUL. reply troupo 3 hours agorootparentYes, they are two different statements. However, the comment I was responding to was making general claims and even used QML and XIB as examples. reply scotty79 12 hours agorootparentprevHTML was designed to describe single A4 page of single column text. The fact that people started building apps with is was miraculous persistence. HTML acquire some functionalities that supported such advanced things as multiple columns or fairly recently some automatic layouts not directly stemming from its text displaying roots. But in terms of flexibility and ease of use they are still behind layouts of Delphi from 20 years ago. reply immibis 8 hours agorootparentprevEven some of the \"proprietary nonsense\" is better than HTML. Visual Basic let you just drag-and-drop controls onto a page, arranged in any way you liked! Now, it wasn't responsive, but we didn't have smartphones back then so nobody cared. reply scotty79 12 hours agoparentprev> HTML is not the mother language Personally I just don't like when people go too much into \" in \" mentality. HTML is decent at describing what's there. CSS is sort of fine at describing how it looks. And JS is ok for describing what should happen. My second guiding principle is that everything should be split into composable components, without anything being privileged. So I don't like page components being special in any way. I can excuse some violations of the first principle in the service of the second one like putting a bit of HTML into JS file instead of keeping separate HTML template file for each component. But I don't really like any CSS in JS. The only connection surface between CSS and JS (and HTML) should be selectors that say what is addressed. CSS classes should identify elements. If you want some classes that describe groups of styles (like tailwind) you can have them but don't cram them directly into HTML. Include them in styles for given element using SASS (or LESS) include functionality. HTML (or JS) shouldn't describe how things look. Also all the frameworks that claim to be almost pure HTML but they cram the adhoc behavior description into fake HTML attributes rub me the wrong way. They remind me of what was there 20 years ago. And any reactive bindings between arbitrary stuff is just ordering whole bowl of old time spaghetti, after Redux (and React) shown that it doesn't have to be like that anymore. I agree that additional challenge of keeping the flow of state centralized and unidirectional might feel unnecessary for simple projects, but it's worth it if the project survives more than few years and grows. reply davedx 11 hours agoparentprev> Magical, not magic - I really don't want it to feel magical either.

Writing JSX is a nightmare to me.

Seperation of concerns right down to component level. It really comes down to how organised the devs and their tools are. reply satvikpendem 13 hours agorootparentOr you could put all that stuff in a single-file component or use JSX with atomic CSS or CSS in JS. reply blackoil 6 hours agorootparentprevDo a 5 why for separation of concern and you'll find JSX is more logical. You want things edited together to be closer in code also. A single file or couple of files next to each other that decide structure, behaviour and view of a component is better than few CSS/JS for whole site. reply notpachet 15 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you about separation of concerns, but I don't think JSX is the guilty party there, so much as the overarching frontend ethos that pushes the idea of \"single file components\" to extremes. reply shdh 13 hours agorootparentprevJSX is an anti-pattern IMO.

I say this as a passionate fullstack developer whos worked for YC startups and a fortune 10 company within the past decade. I appreciate Vercel as a company too; I have no hate towards them but the NextJS 13 release almost made me quit web development. Svelte is an absolute love language to the web and a direction for healing the damage caused by modern \"web frameworks\". It's the absolute direction we need to head in. Here's something beautiful. I'm teaching my brother-in-law programming to get a job when he's out of the military. He's learning JS/CSS/HTML and doing quite well. With about a 2 minute tutorial of how Svelte works; he was able to start creating some pretty impressive projects.

Except that svelte advertises itself constantly as being faster and with smaller bundle sizes. Which is a good thing. I don't buy that it priortizes 'good vibes' at the cost of those other things. If it's saying it prioritizes 'good vibes' and everything else, then that's pretty meaningless - they might as well say they're good at everything. Would also help to actually define what 'good vibes' are because I think every tool tries to make DX as nice as possible. I honestly dislike fluff like this because it conveys nothing and gives fodder for people to ignore practical evidence in favor of biased advertising i.e. someone's going to make a bullet point list about things they dislike, and someone will just point to this and say \"nuh uh, you're wrong, they care about being user-friendly, it says so right here\". Since we're talking about front-end frameworks, I still maintain that vue has some of the best documentation. I fell in love with vue 2 because the documentation did a great balancing act between being brief, simple, and somehow dense at the same time. In particular, I remember a page about it's comparisons to other frameworks that in a few paragraphs, gave a history lesson, simplified differences to barebones, explained the practical implications all in a way that put vue in a good light. It was much better than the angular and react docs at the time. reply gmaster1440 16 hours agoparent> Except that svelte advertises itself constantly as being faster and with smaller bundle sizes. Maybe this is a subtle difference, but I understood it as Svelte still caring about and prioritizing speed and bundle size, but not necessarily as the primary focus with the goal of being the smallest or the fastest. reply pier25 13 hours agoparentprevI agree but there's a difference between the DX vs the execution (how the thing runs internally). I believe the vibes thing refers to the DX, not the engine itself. reply doctor_eval 11 hours agoparentprevI gotta say, the “vibe” of the new $props syntax, to me, is awful. I love that I can just use export let prop; because it’s just JavaScript. The new runes syntax let { prop } = $props Is not. This just makes me incredibly sad. Like all things, everyone is going to switch to the new syntax because it’s shiny, even though it objectively has a greater cognitive load (and IMO, looks ugly). My components are going to start looking like Svelte, rather than JavaScript. The reason I prefer svelte over Vue is because there’s less to remember. Looks like I’ll be looking for a new framework after Svelte 5. Just like I did after Vue 3. Also, > Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and as such slots are deprecated in Svelte 5. Removing slots, which feel really natural in HTML, with snippets - that are expressed as JavaScript values passed to a component - honestly, I don’t see the prioritisation of vibe, here. These changes are going to make it so, so much harder to teach Svelte that I honestly feel despondent. I feel like svelte 5 has just totally forgotten that Svelte is supposed to feel like JavaScript. Super sad. reply __jonas 10 hours agorootparentHow is this new syntax not javascript? I’m not familiar with it but your example is just object destructuring no? What am I missing? reply doctor_eval 10 hours agorootparentBecause it’s introducing a magic global compiler directive - $props - that’s unique to Svelte. Everyone knows what export let prop = 10 means. But what’s $props? It’s a magical invocation (literally, a rune) of a compiler directive. So while it’s valid JS, it’s actually a signal to the compiler, with special behaviour. It’s something you need to learn and understand beyond just JavaScript. Also, to your point, it’s not actually destructuring. This statement is declaring “prop” as a new property. And finally, this statement actually does export “prop” to a user of the component. But that’s no longer explicit. reply __jonas 9 hours agorootparent> Everyone knows what > export let prop = 10 > means. What? I mean that's technically syntactically correct JavaScript but it makes no sense outside of Svelte, and if the prop is not literally named prop like in your example here, it's much harder to understand what this is doing compared to taking a prop value out of a $props object (or rune or whatever), like you would in many other frameworks. I'm just a bit surprised because while I like Svelte I feel like all of is like this, it's all technically JavaScript syntax but all of it is magic that only works through the Svelte compiler, and this new syntax actually looks slightly less so to me, although I wouldn't say I prefer it. reply doctor_eval 9 hours agorootparentBut doesn't export let myProp = 10 work in any JS module? I thought it was quite standard. Maybe I'm mistaken, JS/TS is not my first language, but I think it's pretty obvious what it's doing. In any case, let { myProp = 10 } = $props does not even remotely work like it would in JS. It's literally a compiler directive. That is, $props is not an object. The string \"$props\" is a compile-time directive that declares myProp to be a prop. It's not destructuring $props, it's declaring myProp. \"$props\" is a magic incantation defined within the Svelte compiler. I mean, this is my point really. It's using JS syntax but it's no longer obvious what it's doing. To your point, given that Svelte compiles the code anyway, I don't understand why they couldn't have kept the existing syntax (\"vibe\") and just changed the semantics. Why come up with some brand new, syntactically-compatible- but semantically-incompatible-with-JS, syntax? reply __jonas 9 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"work\"? You can export a mutable variable yes, but why would you? It makes no sense outside of Svelte and it doesn't relate to the rest of the code where you presumably use that variable as if it was set from the outside at the moment you were exporting it or something along those lines. In the end it is also just a compiler directive for svelte, it doesn't end up in the code the svelte compiler outputs. Look at this example: https://svelte.dev/repl/c450c88a415a435485729f4ba88069f1?ver... If you check the JavaScript output tab on right, this prop declaration in Child.svelte > export let count = 0; Has become > let { count = 0 } = $$props; Which looks a lot closer to this new rune syntax, so > does not even remotely work like it would in JS. Is not true at all, it works a lot like this in JS, or at least a lot more than the \"export let\" syntax. Edit: I want to add to your point here: > That is, $props is not an object. The string \"$props\" is a compile-time directive that declares myProp to be a prop. It's not destructuring $props, it's declaring myProp. \"$props\" is a magic incantation defined within the Svelte compiler. I get you on this! I wasn't aware it worked like this and replaces the $$Props interface [1] which I am using to declare component props at the moment. I understand your point and I agree that parsing required props and such out of this destructuring assignment is a bit magical, but to be honest in my view not significantly more magical than the rest of Svelte.

I think this is the only place we really disagree. To me, the export syntax is obvious and consistent, even if under the covers the behaviour is magical. On the other hand, the $props syntax is not obvious; for a putative assignment to result in a declaration has no basis in my previous experience. Both the syntax and the behaviour is magical. If Svelte is about the vibe, Svelte 4 was perfect for me - it’s why I moved from Vue, which I found had too many magic objects, and then doubled down on it with Vue 3 (I think) and refs. With Svelte 5, I feel it’s making the same mistake - the vibe no longer gels with me, and I gotta say, in addition, that pushing reactive behaviour into pure JS feels like a huge mistake to me. Sadly, I think I’ll be getting off this particular train. Edit: I think my reaction to this is because $props - and the other runes - are effectively svelte-specific keywords added to JavaScript. I'm sure the Svelte folks have their reasons for this; but I hate it. They could have just introduced a new actual keyword, like \"prop myProp = 5\". I honestly can't see myself ever adopting Svelte 5. reply shdh 13 hours agoparentprevSvelte is better than Vue IMO reply Aerbil313 13 hours agorootparentI love Svelte, but please make substantial comments on HN.

(Side note: I rate Vue as well, though I prefer SvelteKit over it these days) Rich Harris and the Svelte family have always been pragmatically minded, and there's value in expounding one's development philosophy, but I've gained no insights with this list.

Some quick context: in January I was in London for a few days, and while I was there we had a Svelte Society London event. This document is a text version of a talk I gave there, which expands on some of these ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eswNQiq4T2w&t=5211s It's deliberately brief and vague in parts, because it's designed to spur conversation. It's not set in stone, nor is it an Official Statement on behalf of the Svelte team — it's an attempt to articulate the way that the maintainers tend to find ourselves thinking about some of these topics, as viewed through my personal lens. If it helps explain why you like Svelte, great! If it helps explain why you hate it, that's great too — that's the whole point.

Specifically with SvelteKit the big deal breaker is routing. I also find the whole +page.svelte stuff to be a usability nightmare since I barely use the file explorer to move around a project and instead use fuzzy search. Unfortunately SvelteKit is pretty unflexible so you either love it or hate it.

But, I think other libraries have done this too. React is a great example. It prioritized making the reactivity model really strong, and everything else is less important. (Like performance or bundle size.) To the extent that the official solution to performance issues is writing a compiler for the library to auto-optimize everything, because they don’t want to compromise on the reactivity model itself. To me, that feels like a subjective choice, going more off vibes than certain metrics. (Not making a value judgement, just explaining what I’ve heard at conferences.) In other words, I don’t think “objective BS” got us into this place. Shops which care a lot about performance will have “performance budgets” for things like TTFB or time to reactive. It’s a more objective approach that tries to minimize lots of MB going over the wire. reply jmull 16 hours agoparentprevOn its own it sounds like hand-wavy marketing bs to me...

So, if you're not conscientious, you can just point at the score and say \"all good\" while your site might still have major issues. I assume the same is true of the other checks Lighthouse does for performance, best practices, etc. Lighthouse and other such tools are a good starting point, and using them is better than doing nothing, but a thorough understanding of accessibility etc is necessary to create truly accessible and performant sites. reply nathias 16 hours agoprevSvelte to me is how objective progress in building the web looks like, much like React was just much better than Angular 10 years ago, Svelte just makes sense. reply k__ 16 hours agoprevThat whole text sounds like he gave up.

Tomlinson’s Milwaukee home. Bevan Hurley reports. Saturday 10 February 2024 16:16 Science fiction author Patrick S. Tomlinson, right, says he has been ‘swatted’ 47 times in just over four years. Alan Filion, centre, is suspected of calling in hundreds of hoax bomb and mass shooting incidents (Getty/Seminole County Sheriff’s Office/Patrick S. Tomlinson) The latest headlines from our reporters across the US sent straight to your inbox each weekday SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy notice F or 18 months, a teenager allegedly operated a “swatting” service out of his father’s California home where criminals could call in a hoax bomb threat or mass shooting almost as easily as ordering a burger on UberEats. Alan Winston Filion, 17, is suspected of targeting hundreds of high schools, mosques, historically black churches, US Senators and even the Supreme Court with swatting attacks that placed thousands of people in the crosshairs of heavily-armed police response teams. Prosecutors say the 6ft 3in teenager advertised his services under the pseudonym Torswats on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, charging as little as $40 to get someone’s gas shut off, $50 for a “major police response” and $75 for a “bomb threat/mass shooting threat”. Mr Filion would then post chilling audio of the 911 calls on Telegram as a proof of purchase, according to court documents. Among the hundreds of “swats” that Torswats allegedly claimed credit for were multiple hoax callouts at the home of Patrick S. Tomlinson, a Milwaukee-based science fiction author who says he has been swatted dozens of times in the past four years as part of a targeted harassment campaign by a group of “sociopathic” stalkers. “You can’t fathom the amount of clinical obsession that grips these people,” Mr Tomlinson told The Independent this week. “Trying to destroy my world is their full time lives.” Patrick S. Tomlinson says he has been swatted 47 times in the past four years by Milwaukee Police Department officers (Patrick S. Tomlinson) Mr Tomlinson told The Independent he had woken in the middle of the night to find officers banging on his door, been handcuffed, and had guns shoved in his face during the yearslong ordeal. He was once swatted four times in one day. Mr Filion has not been charged in relation to the swats on Mr Tomlinson’s home, and investigators believe there are at least two individuals behind the Torswats account. The FBI, Milwaukee Police Department and the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office in Florida where the teenager is facing four felony counts declined to provide further information, beyond an extensive account of Mr Filion’s activities in a probable cause charging document. After Mr Filion was arrested on 18 January at his home in Lancaster, Los Angeles County, Mr Tomlinson said he and his wife Niki Robinson had their first decent night of sleep in years. Their relief was short-lived. A new Telegram channel named “Torswats Return” was created by someone claiming that their “partner has been arrested”, according to posts viewed by The Independent. The channel stated that it would continue offering “swats” for as little as $40, and offered returning customers a discounted rate. It also posted derogatory photographs and text about Mr Tomlinson — noting that there would be no charge for requested swats against him. “And of course swats to Patrick… are free,” read the Telegram message. California teenager Alan Winston Filion has been extradited to Florida and charged with calling in hoax bomb threats to a Seminole County mosque (Seminole County Sheriff’s Office) On January 31, Milwaukee Police Department officers arrived at Tomlinson’s home after receiving a hoax report of a shooting at the address — for what Tomlinson says is the 47th time their home had been “swatted” in a little over three years. “It’s just farcical at this point,” Mr Tomlinson told The Independent. “Nobody told them this had happened 46 previous f…ing times.” The MPD denied an open records request by The Independent for callouts to Mr Tomlinson’s home, citing an open FBI investigation. The science fiction author has endured relentless harassment from an anonymous online army of what he describes as “cyber terrorists”. He says they have stalked and impersonated him, defaced his home, and continue to send a daily avalanche of abusive phone calls, voicemail messages and emails. “I wont stop until one of them die (sic),” a message posted to the channel, referring to Mr Tomlinson, on 6 January stated. As swatting incidents have spiked in recent months, victims and cybersecurity experts say law enforcement are failing to deal with the threat. Last month, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley revealed she was targeted by swatting hoaxes twice in two days, and has requested Secret Service protection amid the rising threats to her safety. She is among the dozens of lawmakers, judges in Trump trials and public figures who have experienced tactical response teams turn up at their homes in response to the false callouts. Swatting, defined by the Anti Defamation League (ADL) as a “malicious act of reporting a false crime or emergency to evoke an aggressive response”, emerged from online gaming communities in the early 2000s, where rivals would call 911 on each other and watch the armed response on livestream. The ADL estimates there were over 1,000 swatting incidents in 2019, but the true figure is unclear as there is no federal statute against swatting that would enable convictions to be recorded. Republican presidential candidate and former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley was swatted twice last month (REUTERS) Schools, synagogues, mosques and churches are frequent targets. When hackers stole cancer patient records from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle in December, they threatened to “swat” their homes if ransom demands weren’t met. Even the White House itself was “swatted” last month, sending multiple Washington DC fire and emergency units to the nation’s most famous address. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre addressed the growing swatting scourge from the presidential podium last month, saying it was “creating a danger and a risk to our society”. Experts say swats not only place the victims in danger of being shot by police, they also cost law enforcement around $10,000 per callout. Gregory Winger, a cyber security expert and assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, told The Independent that current laws are not fit to properly punish or deter swatters. He says that lawmakers and celebrities will typically have additional security measures in place, while regular citizens such as Mr Tomlinson are exposed to the very real danger of being shot by police. Mr Tomlinson notes the dangers posed by heavily militarised US police departments. “If one of these calls came in in Nottingham England, they wouldn’t show up with ballistic shields and sub-machine guns. That’s why it’s so dangerous, that’s why it’s attempted murder.” Mr Tomlinson wants to see repeat swatters charged with attempted murder and terrorism. “You’re not dealing with internet trolls here, these are hardened criminals,” he told The Independent. “You have to treat it like a domestic terror cell, they get off on creating chaos and trying to harm people. And in order to keep chasing that high they are only going to escalate.” The most swatted man in America Mr Tomlinson, who dabbles in stand-up comedy, came to the attention of a hardcore group of online stalkers five and a half years ago after posting an innocuous tweet about the late Saturday Night Live comedian Norm Macdonald. “Hot take: I’ve never found Norm Macdonald funny and was pretty sure all my comedy friends who did were either nuts or screwing with me,” he posted on 11 September 2018. Days later, Mr Tomlinson was locked out of his verified Twitter account @stealthygeek. He later discovered a 30,000-strong Reddit group of fans of the former shock jock radio show Opie and Anthony had mass reported him for breaching community standards. Opie and Anthony was canned by SiriusXM in 2014 after the network said co-host Anthony Cumia made “racially-charged and hate-filled remarks” on Twitter. Fans of the show later coalesced on the internet around a shared enjoyment of posting hateful content attacking the LGBTQ community, their supporters and any left-wing commentators they took a dislike to. Author Patrick S. Tomlinson has been relentlessly stalked and harassed for years (Courtesy of Patrick S. Tomlinson) Mr Tomlinson told The Independent his accounts on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook were targeted over the next few months with false complaints. He said the trolls created Twitter accounts impersonating him, which he says posted racist, homophobic abuse in an attempt to discredit him. The Reddit group also posted photoshopped images of Mr Tomlinson and doxxed his home address and phone number. The harassment quickly escalated to death threats left on Mr Tomlinson’s voicemail. Mr Tomlinson said the stalkers began following him to science fiction conventions where they would secretly photograph him and post the images online, and contacted his book publishers claiming they had kidnapped his wife. In June 2019, one of the stalkers paid MacDonald to record a Cameo in which the comedian, who died in 2021, says he was told that someone named Patrick had said he wasn’t funny. He then calls on “Patrick’s friends” to “please continue insulting that fat loser.” The video appears to have encouraged the stalkers to ramp up their efforts. In May 2020, Mr Tomlinson’s home was swatted for the first time when two police officers turned up “ready to go” at his home late one night demanding to know where “the children” were. The swat came soon after stalkers had created a bogus Craigslist advert with Mr Tomlinson’s home address bizarrely claiming that he was kidnapping African-American children, and “grinding them down to make pepperoni”. The twisted claim has echoes of the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed that Democratic Party insiders were keeping child sex slaves in a pizza parlour in Washington DC. The coordinated campaign continued to escalate. The harassers flooded book sale sites Amazon and Goodreads with bogus one star reviews of Mr Tomlinson’s publications in a coordinated assault. After the Opie and Anthony subreddit was removed in 2019 for repeated breaches of its terms of service, the harassers migrated to the website new.onaforums.net where the campaign of torment continued. The site’s message boards have attracted more than 40,000 threads and around one million comments dedicated to what Mr Tomlinson describes as their “total, clinical obsession with my every tweet, thought, public appearance”. Milwaukee Police Department police officers have been called out to hoax threats at the home of Patrick S. Tomlinson dozens of times in the past four years (Courtesy of Patrick S. Tomlinson) Mr Tomlinson wrote in a lengthy tweet thread at the time that the site was being used “to coordinate new attacks, execute, and then brag about the crimes and suffering they’ve inflicted”. The group’s stated goal was to “destroy his career, his marriage and drive him to suicide”, he said. Mr Tomlinson says that security cameras captured stalkers defacing his house and motorcycles. In another cruel move, the group also posted audio on YouTube of Mr Tomlinson screaming in frustration as he is being swatted. Mr Tomlinson reported the group’s obsessive harassment to police and the FBI in May 2020. He said a special agent from the Milwaukee field office was assigned to look into the case, but that he has heard little back about their investigation. “The FBI is a black hole as far as their investigation is concerned,” he told The Independent. “We throw evidence down the hole, and nothing comes out.” Mr Tomlinson said he has reported each swat to the Milwaukee PD and the FBI, and personally gone to his local precinct on several occasions to ask that they stop sending armed police to his home “every time our stalkers tell them to”. After Alan Filion’s arrest, the Torswats Telegram channel is back advertising ‘swats’ for as little as $40 (Screenshot) In a response to The Independent, The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) declined to address why it hasn’t put measures in place to recognise serial swatting attacks at Mr Tomlinson’s home, instead just sharing the same statement it has given other outlets. “Swatting is unacceptable, illegal and potentially very dangerous behavior, as it can lead to a very dynamic situation, placing both the residents involved and our officers at risk,” an MPD spokesperson said. “Out of an abundance of caution, MPD has a duty to respond to calls for service in order to ensure that no one is in danger and that the necessary precautions are taken into consideration during these incidents.” Mr Tomlinson’s attempt to involve law enforcement only seemed to embolden his stalkers, who doubled down on the campaign of emotional torment. At 1am on 25 July 2022, the MPD responded to a hoax 911 call by someone claiming to be Mr Tomlinson saying he had killed his wife and a man in their bed. Mr Tomlinson said he was in bed asleep and woke up to hear pounding on his door, and officers armed with assault rifles surrounding his home. Security footage taken by his home cameras shows him handcuffed on the porch while the MPD searched his home. Mr Tomlinson may be the main target but the stalkers also harass those around him. The same month, while attending her grandfather’s funeral, Mr Tomlinson’s wife discovered she had been impersonated by someone who sent racist emails to Black influencer Marvin Toliver. She was temporarily suspended from work before being cleared of any involvement in sending the hateful messages. Mr Toliver later posted a video to Instagram explaining that the racist messages he’d received were a hoax. Mr Tomlinson’s elderly parents have also been swatted three times, he said. A dedicated ‘swatting’ channel on Telegram has made explicit threats and derogatory posts about author Patrick S. Tomlinson (Screenshot) In September 2022, cyberstalkers sent a “detailed, explicit” death threat to the organisers of the WorldCon in Chicago where Mr Tomlinson was due to appear. A few months later, singer Patti LaBelle was pulled off stage at a concert in Milwaukee and 2,000 audience members were evacuated due to a bomb threat. Six downtown city blocks were shut down for hours while bomb-sniffing dogs checked buildings. Mr Tomlinson told The Independent that MPD officers stopped by his home that night to tell him that the bomb threat had come from stalkers using his name, one of more than half a dozen such hoax bomb threats he had been accused of. In April 2023, he was swatted four times in one day. The fourth time the MPD sent six officers with assault rifles to his home at 9pm. His home has since been swatted a further 20 times, the most recent being just last week. Mr Tomlinson has documented the years of harassment on Twitter, now X, with the posts often enraging the stalkers and drawing dozens of abusive responses. He first spoke at length about the harassment to the Daily Beast in October 2022, and has given interviews to local and national media in the hope it might deter the stalkers, but each time it only seemed to spur them on. Mr Tomlinson also filed a lawsuit in 2020 to try to force the internet service provider Cloudflare to reveal the names of the individuals behind the website. The request to subpoena Cloudflare was denied by the Superior Court of California after a judge ruled it fell under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields blogs and social media sites from problematic content on their platforms posted by third parties. A judge also ordered Mr Tomlinson to pay the anonymous blogger behind the website $23,700 in legal fees. That figure has ballooned to $50,000 with interest and penalties, and Mr Tomlinson said the group behind the blog was trying to bankrupt him and take his house. Mr Tomlinson has refused to cave despite the ongoing threats to his life, and he and his wife suffering from PTSD and chronic insomnia. Rather than relocating or going into hiding, he said he had invested in a top-of-the line security system and bought a “small arsenal of weapons” to protect himself. “I bought my wife a gun for Christmas, just so she could feel more at ease.” ‘Nobody would ever dare swat himself, right?’ Court documents from Mr Filion’s arrest this week provided a rare glimpse into the dark web nexus between an underground network of professional “swatters” and the criminal stalkers who hire them. According to a charging document, the Torswats Telegram channel first came onto the law enforcement’s radar in October 2022, when Anacortes High School in Skagit County, Washington was targeted five times in a week with hoax bomb threats and shooting callouts. Police initially believed a 17-year-old student at the school was behind the swats, before concluding that he had also been a victim of swatting attempts. The Telegram channel that authorities have tied to Mr Filion later posted audio of the 911 calls. Over a month-long period, Torswats posted recordings of fake 911 bomb threats at schools and non-profit organisations in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland and Iowa. In one swatting incident in February 2023, a teenager in Dubuque, Iowa, who had been in contact with Torswats was arrested for ordering a bomb threat at a local high school. In April 2023, Motherboard revealed for the first time how the Torswats Telegram channel was offering to swat victims using a synthesized speech programme for a $75 fee. The next month, Torswats posted audio of a swatting at the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque in Sanford, Florida. The caller allegedly told a dispatch operator that he had a handgun and explosive devices and was going to kill everyone inside “in the name of Satan” while playing audio of gunfire. Around 30 heavily armed police officers were sent to the mosque, Seminole County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The Torswats Telegram channel was also filled with screeds of racist, misogynistic, transphobic and anti-LGBTQ postings, according to prosecutors. In one post, Mr Filion allegedly wrote that he “sent police to the homes of people I don’t like (f… and transsexuals) for fun”, according to a charging document. “While a number of victims targeted by Torswats were the product of conducting a swatting’ service, there is an obvious trend observed in the subject’s targeting and his own words, in which victims are chosen due to their sexual orientation and identity, race or religion,” detectives from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office wrote. In May 2023, the FBI set up a national database to “track and create a real-time picture of swatting incidents” and share information between hundreds of police departments and law enforcement agencies across the country. Judge Arthur Engoron, who presided over a civil fraud trial against the Trump Organisation, was swatted in January (POOL/AFP via Getty Images) In late June, Scott Schubert, the section chief of the FBI Criminal Justice Services Division, gave an interview to NBC News about a new swatting national database that would enable law enforcement to monitor the growing threat. In the following days, Mr Schubert, and the FBI special agents in charge in Pittsburgh, San Antonio and Oklahoma City were targeted in swatting calls. An FBI spokesperson told The Independent that more than 550 swatting incidents have been reported to the database, known as the National Common Operation Picture, in the past seven months. Experts say that figure could be just the tip of the iceberg, as police departments are often reluctant to report swats due to the embarrassment of being duped. “That the FBI is starting to take this seriously and get some data, is a useful thing,” Professor Singer, the cybersecurity expert, told The Independent. “It helps you identify underlying systemic behaviours that might indicate a larger problem.” Swatters are typically prosecuted under state False Information and Hoaxes laws. But without a federal statute, law enforcement are constrained from devoting additional resources to training 911 dispatchers or investigating cases, Professor Singer said. Meanwhile, “swatters” are sharing information and learning from one anothers’ tactics to stay one step ahead of authorities, Professor Singer said. He called for more sophisticated IT systems in police call centres to identify the location of where the phone call is coming from, and mandatory reporting of swats. “People seem willing to do things online that they would never do in real life. And this is an illustration of where that kind of online harassment mentality can lead. It’s never been good, but now it’s actually dangerous,” Professor Singer said. “It used to be spamming, it used to be doxxing, it used to be pizza orders — swatting is a much more destructive evolution of online harassment.” The FBI alleges that in order to learn his trade, Torswats placed nine swatting calls to his own home in Andale Avenue, Lancaster, over a three month period between September and December 2022 to test what the police response would be. The suspect allegedly boasted about calling out the swats on Telegram: “How would I know my methods would work otherwise. Swatting my neighbor means I’m in suspicion. But nobody would ever dare swat himself, right?” His listed home address is in a quiet residential neighbourhood, across the street from a daycare centre. Mr Filion would frequently post content from JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings on Telegram, Google, Discord and YouTube. He allegedly used the handles “Witch King of Angmar” and variations of the word “Ringwraith” to call in swatting incidents, and posted images of Nazgul to Telegram. The LOTR references left investigators with a trail of clues that led FBI agents to his parent’s home in Lancaster, Los Angeles County, in July that year. They interviewed Mr Filion in the presence of his father William and seized phones and computer equipment. A search of the devices located screenshots and images posted to the Torswats Telegram channel, Google map searches of some of the targets, and emails between Mr Filion and cryptocurrency companies Crypto.com, CoinGate and CoinPayments. A person who answered William Filion’s phone hung up when contacted by The Independent. ‘If you hire a hitman, you’re just as guilty of murder’ Mr Tomlinson says the swatting attacks against him stopped suddenly in July last year, right around the time of the FBI raid on the Filion home. Then the day after Thanksgiving, Mr Tomlinson said his home was swatted again for the first time in months. He captured screenshots from a Torswats Telegram channel advertising that it would “resume normal operations” on Christmas. Mr Tomlinson’s home was then targeted again on Christmas morning. The same day, swatters called in hoax threats to the homes of GOP House member Marjorie Taylor Greene and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. Florida Senator Rick Scott’s home in Naples was swatted on 27 December while he was having dinner with his wife. Mr Filion was arrested on 18 January, and extradited to Seminole County, Florida, where he was charged with four felonies related to making a false police report of a mass shooting at a local mosque in May 2023. His arrest was first reported by Wired. His attorney did not respond to The Independent’s multiple requests for comment. Mr Filion made his first appearance in court on 31 January and is being charged as an adult on four felony counts including false reporting of a bomb or weapon of mass destruction, and use of a two-way communication device while involved in an act of terrorism. Both are punishable by decades in prison. Mr Tomlinson told The Independent he hopes the arrest will allow police to work out who was paying Mr Filion and who else is behind Torswats. Investigators stated in court documents that they had traced a Discord account to a “privacy friendly ‘virtual private network’ in Sweden”. Mr Tomlinson says the stalkers who ordered the swats should be just as liable as the person phoning them in. “If you hire a hitman, you’re just as guilty of murder.” More aboutSwattingTelegramFloridaCaliforniaHarassmentNikki HaleyRick ScottMarjorie Taylor GreeneMilwaukee Most Popular Popular videos Sponsored Features",

It's a tough job, but there are also a lot of under-trained, under-educated people that just want to bust down doors and wouldn't actually risk their lives for anyone. In fact, I'm sure some let themselves be used by swatters, as it gives them a chance to use their heavy equipment in low risk scenarios. reply yareal 3 hours agorootparentIt's less dangerous than delivering pizza, and is basically free from accountability. Outside of being exposed to deeply tragic situations, I'm not so sure it's a \"tough job.\" reply tareqak 5 hours agorootparentprevI think “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t” does not adequately capture the issue here. Police departments are incentivized/required to respond to SWATs as genuine incidents; therefore, they are not “damned” by this situation. It is the victims of the SWAT that are “damned”. The article says that a SWAT costs $10,000 US, but that cost is borne by the taxpayer and so it would be up to municipalities to deal with the risk of looking weak on crime or just pay the bill. However, if the police were to not respond to an emergency that required a SWAT team that actually needed one, then they would be accused of not doing their jobs and being “damned” in that fashion. My sad conclusion is that police departments and the different levels of government are not incentivized to solve this problem because the rich, the powerful, and enough of the voting public are sufficiently shielded from the negative consequences. reply wand3r 4 hours agorootparentI was going to make this point above as well but it felt to cynical. Ultimately, I think its just a case of normal people having to respond to an extremely rare and kinetic situation with no playbook as every decision you make is scrutinized and broadcast in HD with full commentary. I'm honestly curious how many times the \"hostage negotiator\" has had to show up and negotiate for hostages. It's hard to imagine what success looks like in that role as (luckily) each of these situations are rare and highly unique. Outside of incidents that good information about the legitimacy of the threat are established, it seems like we should put a lot more effort into tracking down people who make false claims and doing PR on the perpetrators of false allegations. Right now it seems like the risk to the \"informant\" of a SWAT is low and the victim is insanely high. If we narrow these odds without destroying privacy and freedom, that would be the best case. reply resolutebat 1 hour agorootparent\"Normal people with no playbook\"? These are police SWAT teams we're talking about, the entire reason the specialization exists is to make them highly trained to deal with these situations.

How are SWAT teams organized and staffed to have 24/7 coverage? How many SWAT teams cover/overlap a given address? 3. Comparing the answers for 1. and 2. with something like the fire department.

Best practice for an active shooter is to immediately intervene with the first officers to arrive on scene with whatever equipment and training they have on hand, and I’ve seen footage of many instances of officers responding quickly and decisively in those situations. Uvalde was an instance of negligence and cowardice and in my opinion the laws regulating the police aren’t sufficient to hold the Uvalde police department accountable for what they allowed to happen. reply tptacek 4 hours agoparentprevThe entire premise of SWAT calls is to figure out the precise set of circumstances in which police responders can't wait and have to act now. reply wand3r 5 hours agoparentprev> A lot of guns drawn breaking down door situations could be made a lot less dangerous if police stop assuming they need to break in right now. Sure, but \"right now\" is a matter of perspective. There just is not a great answer to hostages being taken by armed & violent criminals. At a certain point you either need to take the initiative, or you're just responding to an opponents initiative. The best case in a situation where the criminals don't give up is an indefinite and expensive situation where dozens of highly paid people stand by feeding pizza to terrorists with a Twitter/Cnn/Facebook simulcast. Someone has to make a move at some point. That said, I do agree with you in principle. If you can get as much information as possible while building rapport, thats ideal. Unfortunately, this isn't always an option and it is very unlikely there will be a good outcome as both parties have diametrically opposed incentives. As you stall for time and gain reinforcements the bargaining power of your side goes up, forcing a more aggressive posture from the other party. That's sort of the Nash equilibrium here, a good outcome is probably an on the ground plea deal with limited violent exchange. Not agreeing violence is the answer but not every hostage taker is John Gruber or the Money Heist crew. Edit: I think this was kind of the rationale on 9/11. Most hostage situations on planes were resolved without huge casualties[1] and then all of a sudden non-rational actors kamikaze the planes, not only killing themselves and the hostages, but using the plane as a weapon. There are a lot of versions of this happening that substantiate taking action. I'm glad I'll likely never have to call the shots on something like this.

There's plenty of laws on the books and in typical American fashion the potential prison sentences are already obscenely long. So no use jacking up the sentences, which is typically the only way politicians bother to address the 'crime of the week'. Deterrence doesn't come from long prison sentences or comically large fines. Deterrence comes form having a high probability of actually getting caught and convicted! But with the mass increase of death threats and doxing has also comes the widespread realization that these are crimes you can get away with.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations How much would you pay a broker for a $1,100-a-month apartment if you knew the rent wouldn’t be jacked up year after year? A broker in Queens was offering apartment hunters the deal of a lifetime: a one-bedroom, rent-stabilized unit in Flushing, well below market rate for the area. The only catch was a $15,000 broker fee to secure the unit. Under rent stabilization, modest annual increases are set by a city panel, shielding tenants from dramatic hikes. That was the predicament facing 27-year-old Christian Garbutt while he was searching for an apartment last month, he told Gothamist. The apartment seemed great, but he couldn’t afford the fee — nor did he want to pay it. But the $15,000 broker fee levied by Miguel Silva, a broker with the New York City branch of the real estate company Keller Williams, was too high for even his employers. In response to questions from Gothamist, they said they are returning some of the money to the tenant who landed the apartment. Broker fees are standard procedure in the city’s highly competitive real estate market, even when tenants find the units online and do most of the work themselves. Typical rates range from a month’s rent to a higher percentage of the yearly total. But as affordable housing dwindles, broker’s fees are rising along with rents, making moves more difficult and dependent on upfront cash, in a sector where laws and regulations remain cloudy. Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized “excessive” fees when she announced a $260,000 penalty against a brokerage firm found to be demanding $20,000 from prospective tenants trying to secure a rent-stabilized apartment, a rare rebuke of the practice. The New York Department of State, which licenses brokers, said in an email that it determines that fees are too high when they exceed “industry norms and standards” and do not relate to actual services. The rules are murky, and no laws explicitly cap broker’s fees or define the difference between reasonable costs and extortion — similar to a once-common arrangement known as “key money.” ‘That’s insane’ Garbutt said he was looking for an apartment in Queens when he came across a place in Flushing priced at $1,450 a month and advertised as a “newly renovated rent-stabilized” one-bedroom on the listings website StreetEasy. He said he toured the unit and “fell in love with it,” but soon found out there was a catch: The broker was asking for an $8,000 fee. Garbutt said he decided to pass on the place because the upfront cost would have wiped out his savings. He said he found another one-bedroom in the same building — this one listed online at $1,100 a month — and again texted the broker. According to text messages reviewed by Gothamist, the broker warned “the fee is also high. It’s much higher than the other one.” He wanted $15,000. Garbutt said he was “shocked” by the figure and could not afford it. He said he stopped responding, even after the broker offered to negotiate the fee and updated the listing to $1,800 a month. “That’s insane,\" Garbutt said of the fee. \"That’s totally not fair. Normal New Yorkers, a lot of people, don't have that type of money saved up.” He said he’s still looking for a place. Silva, the broker, did not respond to requests for comment. Keller Williams said it would return any money over 15% of the annual rent to the tenant who got the apartment. \"Although there are no standard or typical or legal caps on broker fees, Keller Williams NYC adheres to real property law and its guidance in the commission fees that are charged to reasonably relate to legitimate services provided to renters by our agents and firm,” said Richard Amato, an operating principal at the firm. Here’s what you need to know about broker’s fees and what to do if you think you’re being overcharged. What are the upfront costs for renting an apartment? Renting an apartment in New York City is hard. The broker’s fee, a uniquely New York inconvenience that has spread to a few other places, can make it even harder. Along with the first month’s rent, security deposit and moving expenses, apartment hunters in the five boroughs typically have to fork over even more money to a middleman — a broker — usually hired by a landlord to list and show apartments. Brokers typically charge a one-time fee of around 8% to 15% of the annual rent, or roughly $5,400 on a $3,000-a-month apartment. In most cases, there is no way of getting around it, said Allia Mohamed, CEO of listings and landlord review website openigloo. “It’s not really fair, but if you want to get that specific apartment you have to be prepared to pay up,” Mohamed said. What is a broker anyway? A real estate broker is a person who facilitates the sale or rental of a property, typically for a fee. Real estate brokers in the Empire State are regulated by the New York Department of State, which grants them a license if they meet the requirements and pass an exam. Normally, people hire brokers to survey the market and find prospective options to buy or rent a place. But in New York City, it's more common for landlords to hire the brokers to list the apartments on StreetEasy, Trulia and other platforms that charge a fee, and arrange visits with applicants. It’s then left to tenants to pay their commission. How much is too much? There’s a limit to what’s considered reasonable, according to industry regulators and lawmakers. Even many brokers agree that some fees are truly exorbitant. But where brokers cross the line isn’t clearly spelled out. Regulators from the Department of State didn’t respond to a question about what they consider the industry standard for New York City broker fees. Industry groups generally agree that 15% of the annual rent is the norm. Yet brokers know that someone with disposable income may be willing to pony up for a rent-stabilized apartment, since they could save money down the road. That’s the argument Garbutt said his broker made. “He said it’s a lot of money, but you’re going to see it in the long run,” Garbutt recalled. Still, that arrangement locks out the vast majority of New Yorkers who can only dream of paying that kind of fee. The median household income in New York City is around $76,600, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Median rents are about $4,100 in Manhattan and $2,500 in Queens, according to the latest StreetEasy review of listings. And most New Yorkers are considered rent-burdened, as they pay more than 30% of their income on rent, city housing data shows. For a $3,000-a-month apartment, that means you would need $11,400 upfront to cover the security deposit, first month of rent and 15% broker’s fee. If you suspect you’re being overcharged, you can file a complaint with the Department of State. So is anyone doing anything about these fees? Past efforts to limit the fees have all failed. The Real Estate Board of New York, or REBNY, successfully sued to end a brief cap on broker’s fees for tenants, based on an interpretation of state rent laws enacted in 2019. A City Council bill limiting broker’s fees to one month’s rent also died in 2019 amid opposition from the real estate industry. The latest attempt? A City Council bill that would require whoever hired the broker — such as the landlord, property manager or tenant — to cover the cost. “I don't think anyone should be forced to pay a fee to someone who they never hired,” said Councilmember Chi Ossé of Brooklyn, who introduced the measure. “It's kind of replicating how we do transactions in every other industry within the city.” REBNY and other critics of the bill say it will lead to higher rents on non-rent-stabilized apartments because landlords will spread the cost across the monthly rent payments for as long as the tenant lives there, instead of a one-time fee. Owners of rent-stabilized units would have to eat the cost. “This bill would make the process of renting an apartment more costly and challenging for New Yorkers while negatively impacting the livelihood of hardworking agents,” said REBNY spokesperson Christopher Santarelli. Veteran broker Sam Moritz agreed. “The tenant paying the broker fee is what it is,” he said. “If you eliminate the tenant-paid broker fee for apartments, rents are going to increase.” Nikki Thomas, a broker and real estate agent for the Corcoran Group, declined to take a position on the legislation but said nixing the fee could be good business for property owners. Thomas said she often encourages landlords to pay her commission and then add the price to the rent, since people get alienated by “junk fees.” “I usually tell them to adjust the rent to factor that in, because I know people psychologically don’t like additional upfront costs,” she said. “You’re starting off with a happier tenant.” So what are you paying for exactly? Convenience — usually for the landlord — said Mohamed, the openigloo executive. The brokers advertise the apartments, arrange showings and put together applications for the property owner, she said. “When the landlord is hiring the broker, they’re the ones benefiting from the headache the broker is taking off their shoulders,” Mohamed said. “They definitely put in a ton of work in helping the landlord sift through applicants and prepare that space.” Moritz, the longtime broker, said the services are especially important when the landlord lives outside the city or has a busy schedule that prevents them from continuously showing the apartment. “They want to hire a professional, someone who does this full time and closes deals efficiently and professionally,” he said. The brokers also have to cover some costs. Posting the apartment on StreetEasy costs $7 a day, or more than $200 a month, for example. Moritz said he charges tenants the equivalent of one month’s rent so that he can get apartments leased up as quickly as possible. He said he figures he needs to earn about $6,500 a month to cover his own rent and expenses in Bushwick, which equates to at least three or four broker fees a month, he said. He criticized brokers who charge exorbitant fees and said they are taking advantage of tenants and owners. “I think that is a little greedy because this is the landlord’s asset,” Moritz said. “I personally think that if a landlord gives me a listing, then I am working for the landlord.” Plenty of tenants also end up hiring brokers to help them find an apartment, especially if they have disposable income, a busy schedule or are moving to New York City from somewhere else. “A broker can accomplish in a few days what might take someone several weeks,” Thomas of the Corcoran Group said. “Like so many things, you can do it on your own, but is it actually worth it?” Tagged NEW YORK CITY QUEENS HOUSING POLITICS David Brand David is a reporter covering housing for Gothamist and WNYC.

In my section of Germany, housing is even worse with rent caps and tenant rights, plus a lack of housing. Tenants are hard to move on, so landlords are painfully cautious about getting the right tenants - and there isn't a lot of money to maintain properties either, it seems. Our place has the worst decor and electrics, terrible ventilation and mould. And I think we're at the high end. Systems geared up for incumbents, like \"council houses for life\" in London, ought to be sunset, just to get housing moving again. I don't think rent control works well, but I don't think open market rent works either. Anything critical with a limited supply needs to be externally regulated in ways that keep the wheels moving. reply ethanbond 17 hours agoparentLand Value Tax: Make it financially unfeasible to speculate, to withhold units from the market, and to withhold unused land from the market. Let prices freely fluctuate with the market. Increases in rent derived from externalities (i.e. Amazon HQ2 setting up shop nearby or a new subway station) go back into public coffers, while increases in rent derived from landlord actions (i.e. renovations, building bigger, better units that command higher prices) go directly into their pockets. reply conductr 17 hours agorootparentI'm in Texas, a state with pretty high property tax. We've also seen a ton of appreciation in recent years. Booming economy, transplants from other states, then the COVID factor. We also have a near free market on rent; I've been a landlord and not aware of any limitations. There are a couple limits on property taxes (namely a cap of 10% increase per year on \"homesteads\", and an Agriculture exemption for rural properties). But for most people in the towns and cities, this means our property tax bills have been growing 10% a year for probably the last 15+ years. So, the problem we're having now is people that have owned a home for decades or even just 5 years are finding they get forced to sell because they can't afford the tax bill. Since housing has appreciated, they're not just forced to sell, they're likely forced to leave their community for another cheaper place. I don't think it's right to lock up land/property forever, but I do think people buying property should be able to predict whether they will be able to afford to continue living there as they age. Even rather young families are dealing with this. I personally think it's awful to see elderly people getting priced out of a house they've owned for decades, young families have to move their kids in their high school years because the taxes have become unmanageable, how it disproportionately impacts POC as gentrification occurs, and all the other ways it impacts people's lives who just thought they were buying a house to set roots for their lives/families but then externalities cause it to suddenly become unaffordable. It's extremely perverse when you consider that these people's tax dollars are often used by politicians to encourage the very \"growth\" that contributes to their affordability problem. They court corporations and give huge tax breaks to move their offices/factories to Texas, which drives up the demand for housing, etc. reply bombcar 17 hours agorootparentProperty tax on owner-occupied residential property everywhere should have a \"replace it with a lien against the property\" option - some states have it.

If you are at least 61, and your disposable income is less than 70% of the median income for your county you get two forms of property tax relief: 1. The assessed value of your property is frozen at the value of the first year you signed up for the tax relief. If your disposable income goes about the threshold for a year but comes back down the next you won't lose your frozen assessment. If you go above the threshold for two consecutive years you do lose the freeze. When it comes back down again you get a new freeze at whatever the current assessment is. 2. You are exempt from all \"excess property taxes\" and part of the state property tax that is for schools. An \"excess property tax\" generally means voter-approved levies, such as local school taxes. If your disposable income is under 60% of the median income for your county but above 50% in addition to #1 and #2, you get: 3. You are exempt from regular property taxes on the maximum of $50k or 35% of the property value, but not more than $70k. For example for a $400k property you'd be exempt for $70k, so your regular property taxes would be computed as if your property was assessed at $330k. If your disposable is under 50% of the median income for your county, in addition to #1 and #2, instead of #3 you get: #4. You are exempt from regular property taxes on the maximum of $60k or 60% of the property value. For a $400k property this would mean regular property taxes would be based on a value of $160k. In my county the 70/60/50% thresholds are $65k/$56k/$46k. In my county a $400k assessed value home for someone below the $46k threshold would have an annual tax of $900, compared to around $3400 for someone not in the tax relief program. Here is a breakdown of the two (with some rounding): $300 $ 760 fire $240 $1000 state general $ 930 local school $140 $ 360 county road $100 $ 260 county $ 50 $ 130 stormwater management $ 40 $ 111 regional library $ 7 $ 18 PUD $ 2 $ 2 noxious weed Someone below the 70% threshold but not below the 60% threshold would pay about $2200, so still a big savings over the normal amount. reply rootusrootus 15 hours agorootparentprev10% is brutal.

In the drama that unfollowed there was also this little nugget: the landlord was on the HOA Board, and was one of the ones who pushed for the forced sale, and then voted in favor of the Board accepting his short offer on the house.

This makes it more of a modest investment overall, one that people would stop tying their entire net with to Deferring tax increases based on the sale of a house until the next owner is what California does and it’s a disaster.

Onward to the land. The only real reason for land to appreciate is because it ia scarce resource. But then you see that the land also has a carrying cost (taxes) that is fixed regardless of its use. Therein lies the dilemma. If land is an asset that generates expense , and then that expense only grows as time passes but theres no income associated with it, are you really seeing land appreciation when you sell, or are you simply recouping your carrying cost during the term it was held? reply tmaly 15 hours agorootparentprevI am curios what you consider pretty high property tax?

LVT would actually negate the parent posters complaints, as only the underlying land would be assessed and the penalties only really kick in if the land is unoccupied or is not utilized (sitting vacant is the most common of this, followed by lack of utilization, for instance under many LVT implementations large lot owners with single homes also get hit with underutilization penalties to encourage subdividing and utilization of the land which is a net win for society And often the immediate land owner. Objections tend to philosophical on this point) It disincentives empty / under-utilized land holdings like vacant lots or lots that could support more utilization (usually via an activities like building homes on top and selling / renting them or farming) There is nuance in implementation details but in broad strokes that covers it in tl;dr fashion reply zx8080 9 hours agorootparentprevHow do the property prices behave?

I can't say that I have any big problem with that at the end of the day, but if you think getting young families into housing is a more important goal for society, then it does seem like a waste.

True but if you're turning 65 after you're tax bill has grown 10% for over a decade as your transitioning to your fixed income years; it's not a good thing just to freeze the tax bill. You might not have time to earn and save enough to cover the value it gets frozen at. It does help soften the blow for many though. > But honestly it might be better for them to downsize into something more appropriate and perhaps free up the larger houses for families. I wholeheartedly despise this line of thought, unless it's coming from their individual decision to downsize. You're basically treating the house like a commodity. It's a Home this person lived in, raised family in, hopes to continue hosting holidays in, where grandchildren can go to visit, etc. They should be able to use it until they decide to leave. On average, they only have another decade or so of life left anyway after their taxes get frozen at 65, let them enjoy their home. reply no_wizard 16 hours agorootparentIf you despise that thinking, then we need to regulate the housing market to discourage seeing housing as an investment as we see it today. Everyone expects, more or less, for real estate to climb in value but nobody wants to square that with these other emotional ideas attached to housing. It either is an asset or it’s a commodity as far as the market goes. If you want generational housing and for housing to be generally affordable something has to give. Kill it as an asset class and you get what you’re looking for. 10 years is a long time in the housing market. Assets sitting for 10 years under utilized is another way to think about it. These two ideas - that housing is an investment and that people shouldn’t be incurring tax burdens on them like this - do not square reply conductr 16 hours agorootparentIt's fine to be an investment. It can climb in value. But it doesn't need to be such a need to force the liquidity. Your example of \"under utilized asset\" and downsizing must then translate down to some metric of square-footage per resident. How exactly to you propose to regulate the housing market with this in mind, in a reasonable manner. Because, to me I think of the 2 sides. Growing households and shrinking ones. On the shrinking side, we want the government enforcing laws requiring homes get sold as each child moves out to adult hood? Then again as each spouse dies? On the growing family side, they get to move into a bigger house only as each child is born? This is just insane right? I personally do not think 10 years is that long in housing. Sure a lot can change in housing over that time but at any given moment, If I'm in need of housing and supply doesn't exist, I can build a custom home in less than 2 years. I can buy in a development basically immediately. This might not be a global truth but it's the state of things in Texas specifically, and has been for a long time. Affordability is the limiting factor, not time. I think the property taxes in Texas make sense if RE grows at rate of inflation. For a long time, we had affordable housing and now that's not necessarily the case. So the rules/laws need to change to protect people from getting priced out due to taxes is all. It's an issue that didn't bother anyone before because they were assuming their raise in income would cover the raise in taxes. But wages don't increase 10% annually like our taxes do (whole other topic LOL!) so they get put in a hole. Anyone coming into the market now knows the prices, it's all available information, and they can decided if they want to move here or not. It could all be a bubble that pops and corrects one day, but not until inbound population growth slows down. reply no_wizard 16 hours agorootparentmarket churn (which is in part informed by time) matter with affordability. I don’t propose what you’re saying either. A land value tax is more than sufficient, by any research I’ve seen on this topic. It doesn’t in any sense mean what you’re saying here. Only that under utilized land (usually classified as unbuilt or vacant) is taxed more heavily. Thats one facet. The other is that it shifts the property tax off of building values and onto land values can make both buildings and land less expensive. This has a knock off affect of reducing the value of real estate holdings to varying degrees in terms of value in the short term but stabilizes in the medium and long term. That would be better in my view but as it exists today, we instead have to rely on building more housing or putting more existing supply in the market, neither of which in broad strokes are happening in a way that keeps pace with demand unfortunately Also: not everyone who can afford to buy a home can buy a home built from scratch.

My property market value could increase 10% but my taxes will only go up 3%. During the housing crash of the 2000s, my property lost about 40% of its value. My taxes still went up 3% every year because the gap between actual value and taxable value was so large.

Enforce owner-occupancy aggressively. You can own two housing units untaxed, as long as you can produce evidence you spent at least 30 days a year in each of them. This doesn't disrupt non-speculators-- even the modest rich with a single vacation home, or the snowbirds who have a home in Minnesota and a winter place in Arizona don't see an impact. Anything beyond that? Annual tax of 70% of its appraised value. Nothing appreciates fast enough to justify holding it at that cost, so you'd see a fire-sale on housing. Add some cheap state-backed credit to lubricate the transition period, and unoccupied units glut the market while renters become owners. Multi-family structures might create some interesting situations. With the landlord effectively forced to divest himself of properties, he has to reinvent himself as a service contractor, bidding for the maintenance contract on the buildings he once owned.

I'd expect that this would end up being relevant in only a very narrow set of cases. Most cases are slam-dunk clearly \"owner occupier\" versus \"investor-owned\", and hopefully they'd put more than a HN post worth of effort trying to define rules that handle the ambiguous cases. I tend to be a bit suspicious of the LVT, because it can create toxic consequences for individual landowners. Sure, if I have an empty lot and a new Job Factory opens next door, a rising LVT creates incentive for me to build. But if I already had a house there, my LVT has tripled and my house is no longer affordable.

A lot of landlords insist on this type of contract, which makes it much harder to find housing for foreigners and those who decided to cut contact with their families. Landlords basically have no other option, we don't really have a credit score system like the US does, so it's much harder to verify how trustworthy you are.

You can open an account and never use it, and your credit score is just as good as someone who borrowed $10,000 at 30% APR and makes the minimum payment every month. Probably better, because lower \"credit utilization\". reply lazide 14 hours agorootparentNot true, based on everything I’ve ever seen for credit reporting. Holding zero balances on accounts means you aren’t costing them money, which is better than defaulting on loans, not making payments, etc. but doesn’t mean you actually made them much money. People who never get into debt are generally not valuable customers for companies who make their money off interest. People who require they keep book keeping/overhead for (aka keep active accounts), while not paying them money are actually costing them money. If you show a past history of being able to cost them money, and then not actually doing so, or even making them money, that is certainly better than actually costing them money. Aka, you held some debt for awhile, but made your payments and paid it off. Those are high credit score/low risk folks. Having large outstanding credit balances (especially escalating ones) and only making minimum payments means you’re currently making them money, but are a relatively high risk of costing them money shortly in the future when you inevitably default. Which is a low credit score/high credit risk. If you have high open credit, but rarely use it, they can’t tell if you’re high risk (you’re waiting to blow all your credit and leave the country) or low risk (would work yourself to the bone to pay every dollar back and would never overcommit) - but one thing is for sure, you aren’t actually making them money right now, and there is some risk you’ll max out your credit and disappear. If you are paying ongoing interest and never default though, you’re the gravy customer for a CC company, as you’re be paying them waaaaay more interest than anyone else. So medium credit score, medium credit risk. It’s a balancing act. Someone with zero credit history is a complete unknown, which for various reasons is likely the highest risk of all, and why it’s also only slightly easier to get credit in that situation than if you were a serial bankruptcy machine. reply Tijdreiziger 16 hours agorootparentprevIf I pay a landlord rent every month, I make them money.

I'm yet to find a rental property that lets you pay rent in arrears, so there's absolutely no use of credit occurring. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentSince it takes quite awhile to evict in most places if you stop paying (months to years), they've always got some degree of 'arrears' risk going on. Not to mention you have the ability to literally burn down their property (even by accident) with no real way they can stop you, since you have the run of the place. At best they can try to lock you up afterwards, but if you do it right it would be nearly impossible to prove. Having a tenant in possession is always a 'credit' risk. reply FireBeyond 8 hours agorootparentNone of which is 'credit' in the sense of a score. And the fact that you have PM companies doing it as a \"value added service\", for a fee of course, rather than in the normal course of business also shows how shady this is. If it's credit, report it. Don't charge people a fee to do so. I'm actually fairly surprised the bureaus haven't forbidden this. And if I was a renter and this was being done to me as a condition of rental I'd be disputing the tradeline. > they've always got some degree of 'arrears' risk going on. That's not a default of an extended line of credit. > Not to mention you have the ability to literally burn down their property (even by accident) with no real way they can stop you That's your investment risk as a landlord and why you carry insurance, still has nothing to do with my creditworthiness. Like you say, \"even by accident\". reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentIf credit is the concept of ‘I get back what I loaned out, plus agreed upon interest per the agreement’ all of the situations are 100% credit like. If you like it or not. And the credit score is all about if you’re a worthwhile person for a lender to lend money to. Same reason some employers like to check your credit if they expect you to be handling their or their customers money. A track record of following your agreements when other people’s money is at stake, in a way they can get what is agreed on at the end of the day is important to them - and to if they want to place their money or assets in your hands going forward. There are many ways for a loan, or tenant, to go south and be a bad deal for them. If that is inconvenient for you, they’ll usually be happy to tell you to bother someone else instead. If they’re smart, anyway. Dumb lenders lose principal, and that’s death to them if they do it too often. Personally I don’t write loans/notes or rent out property because I’m not interested in dealing with the manipulation or excuses. I do have excellent credit though. And have had people write private notes for some side projects of mine. YMMV. reply FireBeyond 7 hours agorootparentCredit in the sense of credit bureaus is the extension of secured or unsecured credit. You pay upfront for the use of a home/apartment/condo - you are not being extended any kind of credit. For the same reason prepaid phones don't report to credit bureaus. That corner cases exist where you might be out money through the fault - or not - of the tenant doesn't make it a credit instrument. All of your examples are entirely understandable - they're just not credit. That's why there are separate reporting agencies for tenants and evictions. No matter how you slice it, you are not extending credit to anyone by renting your home. > A track record of following your agreements when other people’s money is at stake, in a way they can get what is agreed on at the end of the day is important to them - and to if they want to place their money or assets in your hands. Now you're trying to conflate doing a credit _check_ for prospective tenants (something I have zero issue with and is completely different to this) with \"allowing property management companies to, for a fee of course, report your entirely-paid-in-advance rental / lease payments as credit arrangements in arrears. Perhaps if you start billing your rent in arrears, there would be a case for this. To wit, the fact that in some situations you might be out some money doesn’t mean you have extended someone credit. > If credit is the concept of ‘I get back what I loaned out, plus agreed upon interest per the agreement’ By your argument if you lend me your car and ask me to fill it with gas/replace the gas I used and I don’t, you could report my default to a CRA. Somehow I don’t think that would work. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentThis comment is really weird. Because the comment you are replying to literally doesn’t say the things you seem to be replying to, and instead does actually say what you seem to think it should say? Did you read it before replying? For instance, I literally said a lease is ‘credit like’. Not actually credit. And that some landlords and employers might want to check your credit report before engaging with you to see how you do with credit, as they might give them useful information on how you might do in other areas they care about - not that they would report their own activities there. The car loaner situation is also completely inapplicable to a lease - which, btw, is almost the exact same broad structure as a bond. Possession of X is given to debtor in exchange for monthly payments of Y with some additional conditions, and in the event of default or end of term, X needs to be returned to the bond writer in whole. With optionally some funds held in escrow (security deposit) in case of default or damage to X. It’s real property for a given time in exchange for rent of course, not a chunk of principal for time in exchange for interest, but it’s the same kind of deal. And similar to most bonds, the full interest/rent amount isn’t paid up front. It’s done for given periods of time (a month being pretty standard). Now one could imagine a way a car loaner could be structured so that payment of gas IS payment for the loaner, and even how it could be structured as an automobile lease. But it would require that structure no? And would be pretty ridiculous paperwork wise. Property leases already follow that structure. reply FireBeyond 5 hours agorootparentOkay, let's back it up to the simple part - which isn't to say anything about you, but things went in several different directions. Right - leases are credit-like, somewhat. However, leaving aside the concept of eviction taking time (that to me is investment risk, not 'extending credit') - lease payments are made in advance, and when I was a tenant, every single one had a clause allowing for termination in the event that prompt payment was not made, in advance. My objection there is that these payments should not be being reported to Credit Reporting Agencies because they're not credit. And as supporting evidence, if they were credit, every tenant for decades would have every lease or rental agreement being reported as a matter of business. Why has that not happened? Because it's not credit. And now, some \"innovative\" companies are offering to work with Property Managers and landlords to offer it as a \"service\" to their tenants. However, you look at things and very quickly you realize the benefit to the tenant is almost a side effect: These services charge a fee to the tenant, a portion of which goes to the landlord (can you say kickback?), and if you look at the websites of these services, the \"allow your tenants to record good payment history on their credit report\" is but one bullet point. Every other bullet point talks about the benefits to you as a landlord. You mentioned landlords doing credit checks to establish a sense of the tenant's fiscal responsibility. I think that is fine. As for evictions, damage, deposits being withheld, and so on - there's a need for that. And it exists, entirely separate to the CRAs. This whole thread started because of one point, that I don't believe they should be able to report it as a credit tradeline, because it's not. And I still think the single biggest argument I have that that's the case is that it's only been in the last three or so years that this has been offered, when credit reporting has been around since the 1980s. reply lazide 14 hours agorootparentprevYou are promising to keep paying them x amount of USD per month over time, in exchange for control of the asset and hence them taking on the risk of you trashing the place or that they could find someone willing to pay more during that time. A loan has a risk to the principal that you’ll not repay it in full. A lease has a risk to the principal that you’ll drive down the value of the property or even destroy it. Same difference, approximately. Both have the actual cost they’ll be worth less at the end of the term than they were beforehand, due to inflation and wear/tear. The biggest difference between a loan and a lease is that instead of them giving you x amount of $ directly (aka exclusive control of that money), they’re giving you exclusive or semi-exclusive control of an asset they value at x amount of $. And that the asset has an address attached to it, and you can live there. reply sofixa 17 hours agorootparentprev> Landlords basically have no other option, we don't really have a credit score system like the US does, so it's much harder to verify how trustworthy you are. There are agencies that can tell you if somebody's currently in debt or not, but as far as I'm aware, somebody with no credit history is basically indistinguishable from somebody with \"good\" history.

The government heavily co-finances new construction for a subset of flats being offered as affordable housing, but with a 30 year limit to these restrictions. It's a subsidy for the rich. You break even, and you get some very cheap real estate in 30 years. The government should've just done the construction itself. A lot of social housing is currently reaching that 30 year mark, and it's barely being replaced. And costs for new constructions simply don't make a lot of sense right now, also affected by increasing building standards - which also prevent conversion of much vacant commercial space. reply gnfargbl 16 hours agorootparentThat's pretty much how the private rental market worked in the UK, for a two or three decades at least. The game was to buy a house with a small deposit, break even on the running and loan costs, and benefit from the huge leverage in your investment as house prices rose. Recently, the current government decided this game was unfair, and tightened taxes and housing regulations to the point where it only really makes sense now for large corporate landlords. Unsurprisingly this led to landlords exiting the market, and now there are too few rentals, leading to insane rents. reply scythe 17 hours agorootparentprevCuriously, some places (notably San Francisco) in the United States have the opposite system: rents are unregulated for the first few decades of a building's life, and then annual increases are capped after that. This ensures that the older housing stays affordable for the people who live in it, but it allows prices to rise for new construction, which should in principle increase the amount of housing that gets built. In theory buildings should generate most of their value in the early part of their life when they're more desirable. This system isn't always managed as well as it could be — subsidized unit requirements are layered on top of that, and in St. Paul the payoff period is only thirty years, which has made some developers balk.

I guess I can see charging some money, but pre-vetting renters is probably just a matter of submitting their application to some service, and maybe doing a Google search, right? How much would you pay someone for that? About $7500? And I imagine that in an $1100 rent-controlled building, you don't have to do too many showings before someone bites, so how much of a burden is that? A few hours? Would you pay me $7500 for that? I guess I could see $1000 being a generous amount of money for brokers fees in this situation, if everything was being fairly run. So, in my view, the difference between the asked-for $15000 and the generous $1000 is the amount of inefficiency in this process introduced by what amounts to greed. Greed is to be expected, but when it starts to look predatory, regulators sometimes step in—which means it may be short-sighted and ultimately self-destructive greed. To be fair, probably nothing will come of it, and the market will just dictate these costs.

In many cities, the landlord pays this person and passes the cost on to you in monthly rent. In NYC, the tenant that rents the apartment pays these fees up front. It's kind of like the airlines, you sort by price ascending, pick the cheapest flight, and then are outraged when they charge you a non-middle-seat fee, a carry-on fee, an I-didn't-print-my-boarding-pass-at-home fee, etc. People search for apartments in the same way, so it makes sense that the market would remove anything other than the monthly carrying cost from the listed price. In the end, I'm not sure it's that bad. I moved to NYC in early 2012. I found a rent-stabilized apartment with the help of a broker, and paid about $600 less per month than a market rate apartment.

They just need to build more housing to accommodate it. For instance, I'm a single man. I could get numerous remote jobs. This wouldn't help my chances of dating a young professional woman though if I moved out to BFE. Thus, why I'm in NYC. They just need to make more housing.

I don’t think people who live in other areas of the US would understand it (except maybe SF folks). Competition for apartments is fierce, and pricing was through the roof even then. We lived in Manhattan for 9 years and then got priced out. A brief move to Sunset park, then further out to Bay Ridge. Bay Ridge was reasonable and not too hard to find a place, but it is an hour from Manhattan via subway. The situation seems to be much, much worse now 12 years later from what I have read. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 16 hours agoprevWhen I see people complaining about never being able to purchase a house my response is always the same. move. $1,100 is considered \"well below market rates\" for a 1 bedroom apartment in NYC? That's _nuts_ to me. I'm paying $1,600 for a 3 bed, 2 bath 1800 sq ft house with a 2 car garage. Vaulted ceilings, my neighbor is a police officer and I'm on a corner lot across from a park. fire department is literally 3 blocks away. IOW, I pay more because of the neighborhood. Granted, I live in a LCOL area, but that's kind of the point. If you feel you don't have the buying power, move. Hell, I know a woman who has a mortgage that she pays off of a fixed income and a bit of side work (600/month I think? in that ballpark) and she's buying more house than that. reply BugsJustFindMe 16 hours agoparentThere's a reason why low cost of living areas are low cost of living, and it's not because they're self-sustaining futuristic arcologies. It's because people who can afford otherwise generally don't want to live there. I want to walk, not drive, out my front door, and be within 15 minutes, on foot, from entertainment and dining and friends and shopping and groceries and pharmacies and salons and cafes. And I want those things because I have social/communal living desires, not antisocial/isolated ones, and because I've lived in many different kinds of environments and seen just how much nicer it is to live in a walking city. The problem is that many walkable cities continue to refuse to build upwards. NYC, Philadelphia, Boston...they're all vastly 2-4 story construction from 100 years ago. Paris generally goes up to 7 or 8, but has restrictions preventing much more. So they get more and more expensive. But they only get more and more expensive because they continue to be more desirable places to live despite the expense. reply chrisandchris 15 hours agorootparent> There's a reason why low cost of living areas are low cost of living, and it's not because they're self-sustaining futuristic arcologies.

Nobody else seems angry, but you seem to have something to be angry about. I can tell you from my experience, whatever it is, you seem to apply it to me. You're attributing things to me that I haven't said nor have they crossed my mind, and attacking me about whatever is making your angry. I just stopped by at my favorite spot for a chat. reply stale2002 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is that you are playing a word game that ignores anything that actually matters. Thereby destroying any interesting conversations that could be had about a topic. And you are doing it in the worst way possible where you get to be technically correct, but correct in a way that is completely irrelevant to what anyone else is saying and is also worthless. Here is how this conversation basically went. Other person: \"I like these very common qualities about housing that many other people also like. This is proved by the fact that houses with all these qualities have much higher demand and price\". You: \"Whoa dude. Have you consider that everything is relative? And that there is no way to prove that those qualities are better than other qualities? What about a person who really likes their house to be burnt down. Or to have rats in their walls. Or to have high crime and being in constant danger. Nothing is better or worse dude!\" All of this is completely worthless commentary. Yes, it is technically true that I cannot use math or science to prove that certain qualities about a house are better or worse. But that doesn't matter. Because we live in the real world and it is perfectly ok to generalize preferences without getting into the fact that I cannot prove to the universe that some qualities are better than others. Instead, we can just generalize things based on obvious and common preferences. reply Bajeezus 11 hours agorootparentprevYou're comparing a living superstar to someone who has been dead for over 40 years. reply stale2002 7 hours agorootparentprev> The quality of something and validity of people's preferences doesn't depend on popularit When discussing demand and pricing, preferences are the only thing that matter. By definition the thing that is the most popular is the thing that is the most in demand and therefore has the most money trying to purchase that good. This is important and relevant to the discussion of housing, because it tells us how to satisfy the most people's preferences. Therefore my statement is true and you didn't agree with me when I said: 'Well there is something special about the higher cost places. That thing special, is that they are more desirable by a much larger amount of people.'.

Being shameful for causing harm is also what calling something a crime can mean. See: https://ibb.co/xS3wnhg reply ltbarcly3 14 hours agorootparentRight, you are using a second or forth definition of crime, changing to that despite the original context of the first definition. I'm the one who originally said it's not a hate crime, as much as people act like it is. That you would then accuse me of trying to play games with definitions is really quite remarkable. But lets go along with your desire to get away with using your definition instead of the original way the word was used in this context. Is it really a 'grave offense against morality' for a city to democratically decide to not allow skyscrapers? What would be the consequence of not allowing skyscrapers, is it that people like BugsJustFindMe starve to death? nope. That you will be deprived of basic human needs like shelter or the right to self determination? nope. The 'grave moral harm' done to you is that you can't afford to live within walking distance to that cool bar you like to go to. How ridiculous are you going to be? reply BugsJustFindMe 4 hours agorootparent> Right, you are using a second or forth definition Wait until you hear about the verbs \"sanction\" and \"dust\". Words being able to have multiple common meanings is just facts. reply kredd 15 hours agorootparentprevYour “non-essential” is someone else’s “essential”. Everyone has different needs and wants, and it’s just a useless flamewar. It’s the same as the discussion of whether the cities should stop subsidizing suburbs and other areas. Absolutely useless as everyone have their preferences and we have to find some sort of compromise. reply ltbarcly3 15 hours agorootparent> Your “non-essential” is someone else’s “essential”. I don't think this word means what you think it means. reply BugsJustFindMe 15 hours agorootparentWhat things are essential? A tent, water fountain, and scavenged scraps will keep someone alive. Is a toilet essential, or could you just use the street like the birds and squirrels do without complaint? Is a bidet essential, or could you scrape your anus with paper until you see spots of blood like many americans do? Is internet access essential or could you just go to the library which is free and open to all? I think there are not any objective definitions of what makes a housing situation essential. So in that light, I think if we're going to consider physical needs, we should probably also consider emotional wellbeing. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 14 hours agorootparentwell, as someone who grew up extremely poor (to the point of living in a tent on the side of the river in HS) I'm here to tell you nothing you mentioned is essential. I looked up the average salary in NYC out of curiosity and I make well above the average there. but I live extremely cheaply and part of that is the lessons I learned as a child. I could afford a much bigger house, much nicer cars, more toys. I choose not to. I know people who will finish paying off a vehicle and turn it in for another one. Not essential. Just because someone _feels_ as though something is important doesn't mean that it is. The difference between middle class and poor is that poor has to deal with reality, middle class gets to keep the delusion that things like nice cars are essential. These people are choosing not to move. It's great that they can afford it but maybe they should stop complaining vociferously about how victimized they are for choosing to live in that area. reply BugsJustFindMe 14 hours agorootparent> I'm here to tell you nothing you mentioned is essential. Good, then nothing is essential and we can stop worrying about whether something is essential or not and go back to talking about desirable. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 14 hours agorootparentI don't know that I would take that stance but certainly a bidet and a nice car do not fall under that category, nor does being able to walk to a restaurant. You may try and argue some of the grey areas, but most of the things you listed are _clearly_ not essential, they're desirable by specific people, as you said. reply BugsJustFindMe 14 hours agorootparentWhat makes a toilet essential but not a bidet? Plenty of people manage to survive without toilets. Some of them even in downtown San Francisco (you can tell by the state of the sidewalks). They don't tend to thrive with dignity though. Is it not the dignity and thriving aspect that's ultimately important? What things make you thrive? What things make you feel dignified? Are they essential for your wellbeing? (personally speaking, like many people I have eczema, and my wellbeing tends to be diminished by having a scraped anus) reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 13 hours agorootparentI'm interpreting that as you have eczema on your genitals or anus, I don't know much about eczema so can't speak to the condition so I'll speak in general. My mother has heart issues and she has a pump that's connected to her 24/7. She has a medical condition and so has special needs. I would not call that pump an essential but it certainly is essential for her. The context of this conversation has been _in general_, my responses were never meant to apply to those with medical conditions. to answer your question, a bidet is a nice to have, a toilet would be an essential otherwise you're shitting in the street, as you implied about downtown SF. Because toilet here does not mean literally toilet, but someplace reserved for using the restroom. When I go to the river to fish they have an outhouse there and I absolutely use it, as do construction workers with the mobile outhouses they employ. defecating and urinating are absolutely essential activities, how you clean yourself afterwards needs to happen but any specific way of doing it is not essential. reply BugsJustFindMe 11 hours agorootparent> defecating and urinating are absolutely essential activities But doing them in a toilet is not, unless we start expanding the definition of essential to include dignity and thriving. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 10 hours agorootparentI mean, you're free to make the claim and I honestly hope it makes you feel better about yourself. buuut... well you know your response is bullshit. hey guys, dontcha know the only essentials are death and taxes! otherwise you have to admit that a brand new car driven off the lot is also an essential! yeah, ok... reply kredd 15 hours agorootparentprevCare to elaborate? Obviously something “essential” is a subjective take other than the most basics like “food and shelter”. Walking or being able to take transit to my grocery store is a strict essential for me, but I am sure for people who live in suburbia it is not. I was born and raised in a city with >2M population, and surely my needs are extremely different than someone who is accustomed to a rural life. Even small things like, sleeping in an extremely quiet rural town has been a torture for me every time I tried it. And I am sure, opposite is true for people who are used to hearing absolutely no sounds at night. reply TylerE 15 hours agorootparentprevI think you’re the one not quite getting it. For instance… I am medically… complicated. Living somewhere rural where I’m more than 10 or 15 minutes from an ER isn’t really viable for me. Well, I mean, it would be, right up until it isn’t. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 14 hours agorootparentMy mother is the same way (quadruple bypass that didn't go well). She absolutely lives near a hospital. I live in a city, just one that's LCOL. Hell, one of our hospitals is renowned for it's heart research. reply TylerE 16 hours agoparentprevWhy would people pay hundred a month for complicated broadband internet? All you need is a modem and AOL. That’s basically your argument. Living in a LCOL area is not comparable to living in NYC. There is a reason millions want to live in NYC and almost no one actually wants to live in, say, Iowa. reply deegles 15 hours agorootparentAnd it's a reason why \"just build denser housing\" is not a complete solution. More density makes an area more desirable, so prices will remain flat or in rare cases increase since the demand continues to outstrip supply. I believe the solution involves dramatically looser building regulations and major investment in public transit (essentially, get to Tokyo levels of density). Places like SF or NYC are in that uncanny valley of building just enough to keep demand high but not enough to drop prices. reply buzzert 1 hour agorootparent> major investment in public transit (essentially, get to Tokyo levels of density). FYI, the trains in Tokyo are privately run by corporations. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agorootparentprevThere is the notion of induced demand but it follows a logistic curve rather than a monotonically increasing one. At the limit, you will eventually build enough housing to satiate demand without creating more; there are only a limited amount of people on the planet, after all. reply wolverine876 15 hours agorootparentprevWhich regulations would you cut?

People generally care where they live more than they care about the things you describe. Location is the most important factor for most people in real estate purchases - so much so, that it's a cliche.

You don't seem to grasp a fundamental issue: Your needs are not a universal truth; they are only yours (and whoever happens to share them).

    "originLink": "https://www.propelauth.com/post/interview-dungeon-master",
    "originBody": "Startups Becoming a Dungeon Master for an Interview Andrew Israel Jan 17, 2024 • 4 min read Interviews should be as close as possible to the work that the candidate would do if they join. While that seems like a pretty tautological statement, it is unfortunately not always true. When interviewing as a software engineer, for example, you’ll run into places that lean heavily on algorithms interviews. And don’t get me wrong, those interviews can be fun (in the same way that Project Euler can be fun), but it’s not very relevant for most jobs. For some jobs, it's a proxy for the technical skills you'll need for the job, but often it feels like it’s testing if you took an algo class that covered dynamic programing. So, when we were designing our interviews for Support Engineers, we were met with the same problem - how can we best simulate and test what the job would be like? Support has a lot of unique aspects to it - you have to be able to context switch, you have to be able to debug issues well, you have to be able to make customers feel heard, and so much more all at the same time. For a technical product, you also need to be able to read and write code. The Interview After we talked about it, we decided on a format: We describe a fake product. To avoid everyone needing to ramp up on it, it’s just a simplified clone of a very well known product. We provide docs for the fake product. We provide a queue of emails/questions for that fake product, loosely based on real questions / customer issues we’ve debugged. The goal is to resolve the queue, just like you would in real life. There are so many aspects to this that give us actually a lot of signal. Candidates have to first prioritize the queue, which means deciding which issues seem important and which can wait. Candidates have to be able to parse through questions that are vague or maybe misinterpretations of what’s happening. It’s a pretty interesting exercise, but there’s one problem: You can’t really resolve tickets in isolation. Real customer issues often require back and forth. You may need to clarify something, get more information, dig through logs, etc. Without that, you are just blindly guessing at what the underlying issue is. Becoming a Dungeon Master (DM) To solve that, we took each of the tickets that we made and we created extra assets for them. These are things like code snippets that a customer would send over if prompted, answers that engineers would give if asked about the product, or what the actual underlying issue is (in case it isn’t obvious from the ticket). The idea was that the candidate would basically just say what they would do next and we would provide what happened. It’s been a while since I’ve played DnD, but it feels like a very, very light version of the prep you do when designing a campaign as a DM. You want to be prepared for the different things that might happen, because you aren’t 100% sure which direction they will take it. In the DnD context, this could be someone carefully going over every detail of a room that you didn’t expect them to care about. In the interview context, this could be someone asking to check the status page before responding to a ticket about API errors - something that is very reasonable, but you may not have thought of ahead of time. Fortunately, relative to an entire fantasy world, a small product with minimal docs is pretty easy to prep for. What does it look like in practice? Candidate: Hmm, ok, so the user is getting timeouts in production but not locally. Can they clarify if all requests are timing out or just some? Us: They say it’s every request Candidate: As a sanity check, could we have them make a request to a different service in production and see if that times out? Us: They said that also timed out. Candidate: Great, so this is probably a networking issue that isn’t specific to us. I’d probably ask another question about how their infrastructure is set up. Us: They then apologized and said they figured out the issue from there. They were using Lambda functions in prod but hadn’t set it up to have internet access yet. To be clear, we aren’t expecting the candidate to say “Oh it’s probably in a private subnet,” or even go into the networking weeds with the user, but we are expecting that the right prompts will lead the user to figure it out. The whole exercise takes about 45 minutes and provides a lot of good insights. For that same example, there are a bunch of paths to the same answer. Some candidates will ask if we are down before saying anything to the user, some candidates will try to reproduce the issue themselves (which is hard in this case, but not all of them), and some candidates will lean more heavily on their intuition to figure out what’s wrong. Any problems with it? So far, it’s been going pretty well. I will say there are probably two areas that could be better. The first is that there are occasions where the candidate doesn’t really know the bounds (or lack thereof) of what they can do from the prompt. In these cases, I switch to an easy ticket and walk them through it to show how it works. The second is that it can be tricky to ramp other people up on. The prep work helps standardize the question, but a group of people would likely need to shadow each other for a little while before they can all ask it and compare notes correctly. Summary While it requires a bit of up front work (and some creativity), designing an interview process that mimics the actual day to day responsibilities can give you much more signal than something more divorced from reality. We’ve also received the feedback that it’s a much more enjoyable interview process than most - and it never hurts to provide an excellent candidate experience!",

In the before times the interview was more of a technical conversation, sure they had some gotcha questions, but nothing too brutal. If you had real experience that you could talk about, maybe it was validated against references or a background check. People usually looked for a CS or adjacent degree, and that was enough. The quality of folks wasn't too different in my experience. I really feel for those with a lot of experience that are being dropped into the fire, especially those with families who may not have the time to memorize patterns for 3 months, but are still very capable.

Interviewer: People are just studying leetcode to get jobs, what can we do? Ask harder leetcode questions. 4. Other companies: Let's copy them since they're successful. In short, the questions used to be reasonable until people specifically prepared for them.

Including tech interviews. People continually seek out those signals that imply knowledge and experience and even shared culture, but those signals inevitably become too small (smaller = quicker and easier to weed people out) and then they become the very things that people practice in order to look like they have the knowledge, experience, or shared culture they need in order to get through the doors and secure the opportunities. Then those signals get burned and the cycle starts again (in fact, in my experience the cycles concurrently overlap). reply reactordev 6 hours agorootparentprevSadly, we can’t defer to stack overflow for interview success like we can with code.

The function name is pretty misleading, since it looks like a constructor. Even if it's not a constructor, the functionality is pretty far away from the name you've chosen, so it's not a compelling API design either way. How would others use this function? How is this name self-documenting? The decision here is lacking consideration on all fronts. Also, while I don't immediately recognize the exact language, the style looks off too. The function wetpaperbag is declared in all lowercase, but inside it's calling a function Quit that's capitalized? And, whether this particular language is camel-casing or snake-casing, it's clear that \"wetpaperbag\" isn't going to pass linting either way. Overall, strong no hire. Next.

Google had determined that there was a strong correlation between understanding fundamental computer science and being a strong software engineer, so they began testing for computer science fundamentals. At the time lots of companies were trying to mimic Google's success and it quickly became an industry standard. People began just studying how to answer these questions.

Despite my background in electrical engineering, where I specialize in statistical signal processing, I never had the opportunity to delve into algorithm or data structure courses during my college years.

Leetcode, in comparison, offers a more confined scope, making preparation more manageable and systematic, ultimately helping me break into software engineering. reply switchbak 5 hours agorootparentIf you don't have the background, to me you would be a risky bet since you may be missing some fundamentals.

This was true very early career, and for now at least continues to be true. --- I'm still of the opinion that software will eventually revert to the mean, comparable to other engineering compensation... some year. It probably won't happen until there's significant regulatory and liability burden that doesn't really exist in software yet. Like some in software complain about GDPR or DMA or whatever, but crank that up orders of magnitude and then add career-and-company-ending lawsuit threats on top, and then you have real engineering. Then it becomes much more expensive to do things, profit margins go way down, and pay does as well. Who knows when that'll actually happen. For now, software is bonkers profitable.

It was fun but frustrating. Definitely not as productive as today. Early 2000s internet was kind of like that too. The web was huge relative to what we had to work with and there wasn't the kind of products/services available then so asking leetcode stuff had a logic to it. Admittedly, that's not where we are now for most programmers so it makes sense that the interview process should adapt. reply herval 12 hours agorootparentThe kind of people who do best at FAANG interviews are the ones who enjoy leetcoding.

And there is infinite things to build there and learn. reply xw30992 10 hours agorootparentI get that. I only do medium and easy problems for a reason.

Interviews should give information to both parties about what it would be like if the person joined. Simulating a typical work task, as this article describes, might give you some of that. Though important to remember that's far from all that's relevant to either party. A recently fashionable Leetcode hazing, on the other hand, is mostly \"anti-pattern\". It tells the company whether or not the individual has studied for that ritual specifically, and was willing to submit to it for the approval of this company (or is using this company as practice for the gameable ritual). And it tells the individual nothing except that the company thinks this is a good way to do interviews. reply adamgordonbell 13 hours agoparentI feel like leetcode is a Goodhart's Law thing. When nobody was cramming for it, then at some places it was a good measure. Coding is more like weight lifting sometimes then running. There are some weights that some people just can't pick up. And so if the job involves lifting things that are usually light but occasionally heavy, then a squat becomes a good measure for candidate. But once everyone knows a big squat is the way in, they train squats, they show up in lift suits, they use amyl nitrates and the whole thing stops being a good measure. Because on the job you don't squat in a squat rack, but pick things up where they are found, in the conditions on the ground. Goodheart's law breaks things, because now you have a bunch of people optimized for a task that isn't exactly the job. reply mooreds 13 hours agorootparent> Goodheart's law breaks things, because now you have a bunch of people optimized for a task that isn't exactly the job.

But as it becomes a known thing, people train for it and it becomes a measure of conscientiousness (In the big five sense, aka diligent trainers rise to the top). reply reaperman 7 hours agorootparentprev> they use amyl nitrates I think you meant ammonia.

I have participated in interview processes where, at the last interview, the employer tries to talk the candidate out of taking the job. Discuss the problems, the warts, the intractable issues, and other things that are downsides of this job. Every organization has these. I love this, because the employee is going to find all of the issues out anyway, and it's better for both parties if they part before employment begins if the issues are too much. reply neilv 13 hours agorootparentInteresting, and I could see that working well for some places. I do something related to this in the interview. Part of the interview is more like things you'd tell a colleague who was considering that: pretty accurate characterization of what you know of the work, your idea of pros, things that might or might not be cons for the person, etc. Basically, they show up the first day, and their interactions with me are just the same (plus a little extra excitement on my part that they joined, and now able to share proprietary details but without unpleasant surprises). Six months later, and I'm still just the same (plus extra familiarity and increased mutual trust). And hopefully they also are what they seemed to be in the interview. Though you can't necessarily be 100% candid about everything in an interview, like if you were doing an internal assessment a technology, product, vendor, or competitor. For example, there are personnel issues, company image, proprietary tech, etc. Also, you don't want to say something that ends up misleadingly quoted out of context on a jobs forum or word-of-mouth by someone with a different sense of professionalism or confidentiality, and you don't want to give ammo to a spy from a competitor. In practice, the line of what to say seems pretty intuitive to hit, and I haven't knowingly had a problem with it. Though, when working at one company doing exotic-sounding, high-value-sounding stuff, I did have a couple candidates grill me on the tech and/or on resources. On those I try to respond something like, \"Some of that is very proprietary, and unfortunately can't be talked about much right now until someone joins the team. But I can tell you some of the public information from news articles and such is A, B, and C.

My willingness to practice leetcode isn't correlated with my interest in new work or the work any given job post describes. It's also not correlated with my willingness to invest time in exploring the position. 6 hours of leetcode practice teach me nothing about a position, the work it entails, the problems the company is grappling with, and the people I'd be in the trenches with. 6 hours in conversation or working close to real problems are higher leverage. I have meaningful open source work with real users in the queue, and blog posts that won't write themselves. I feel like it's pretty reasonable to sort positions that don't compel low-leverage busywork that doesn't help me assess the position above those that do.

Do you really think in a company with 50k+ software engineers, where many studied English (but like to conduct CS interviews like they’re CS researchers), that everyone will know and understand details like; how the expected linear time complexity of quickselect works? It’s a nightmare; it’s blind leading the blind.

Genuine appreciation for this can come from seeing how things were for people before we improved awareness and sensitivity. In practice, our improvements aren't always perfect, and they sometimes get misapplied or abused, but overall, people are trying, and some social/societal things are improving. Try to see past the rough spots and growing pains. Even Leetcode interviews (which I think are very bad for software engineering), you can see why that gets cargo-culted. Especially if someone has never had a pre-puzzles/Leetcode interview, and doesn't know it can be better. reply jstarfish 10 hours agorootparentI know I'm being an asshole but that's quite thoughtful. Thanks. > I'm over 40, have been working since I was a teen, and I have understanding and empathy for things like preferred pronouns. Genuine appreciation for this can come from seeing how things were for people before we improved awareness and sensitivity. Same, actually. I made more of an effort two decades ago. My patience has been exhausted with the number of \"victims\" who prove to be cruelly antagonistic when you look under their sympathy narrative. In 20 years my good will has been twisted into: trust nobody, and if I'm feeling sorry for ___, it's a grift. (As a minor case in point, look at the expectations surrounding charity these days. If you give anything at all, you're shamed and berated for not giving more. wtf?) Israel's current antics are unsurprising; every subculture has quietly adopted the Nazi lebensraum playbook of crying oppression and attacking civilians to make gains for themselves. Tolerance and forgiveness is never advocated by progressives (feminists will, occasionally). \"Lie, cheat, shame and kill/cancel\" are their only moves.

They expect people to do well at this.[2] Their actual interview process starts each candidate with a stack of poker chips. In each interview, candidates get to make bets on various things that look like financial trades. If they run out of chips, they're out.

You can try to evaluate traders, but the deep truth is that very good traders can become very bad traders seamlessly because nothing guarantees any success of any kind in that domain. When interviewing software engineers you shouldn't care that much about the abilities that someone shows during the time of a technical interview on a specific day; that's not an appropriate way to measure the skills you need for your business. Leet code is an appropriate way to measure how much such engineer is able to perform as a competitive coder. You will never need a competitive coder in your team; because what to be done in SE is not about coding less than 10 lines of code in less than X minutes to transform data A into data B. But back to candidate selection, due to the short amount of time you have to meet applicants, you finally decide to hire whatever person that succeeded to find the fastest solution to the almost scholastic problem you proposed because in the end, you fail to understand what could be the appropriate selection method : aren't all candidates more or less equivalent if you stop proposing leet code problems ? What can prove that X person with 5 years of exp is less good than that one that worked at google for 6 years ? Does it really matters than candidate Y doesn't know Go when all the languages we use aren't that truly different ? Is someone from nowhere, without any education of any sort, but that seems to be an hobbyist programmer since his childhood really a bad candidate ? You never know, but because whether you're HR or the person with technical authority in the team, you don't want to risk anything, and you believe that a good leet code solver can do the work. And finally, to me, that's the truth : more than 50% of the persons you decided to offer an interview would have done the work with success, and at least 20% seemed very nice, and you couldn't choose so leet code was the thing. reply a_wild_dandan 11 hours agoparentprevThey should live stream interviewing the stock trading fish.

Not to mention you stand the chance of some normally useful thing getting further along too. Work with the person like they’re “consultant for a day” and see where you get to.

Of course, the downside is that it required me to spend four hours working on this at home, and then another several hours at the interview - but having to spend time interviewing is something that cannot be avoided, so I'd much rather the time be spent on something relevant that actually shows off my abilities, rather than playing Advent of Code with money at stake, or filling out astrological profiles. reply a_wild_dandan 10 hours agorootparentWhat hourly rate did you charge?

But if you discount the take-home portion - four hours - everything else would still have taken time, because I had to spend time on the phone with HR for the initial screen, and I had to go in for an interview afterwards anyway, and ain't nobody going to pay you for the privilege of interviewing. And if I'm going to spend time displaying my abilities, doing it quietly at home on my own time is vastly better than in a shitty meeting room with two people breathing down my fucking neck.

Perhaps they work by staring at the problem on their screen a lot, perhaps they struggle to think at the same time as roleplaying. Just saying that this roleplaying aspect is somewhat tested for and doesnt align with the job exactly. reply abathur 13 hours agoparentThe interview the post describes actually sounds like a good format for me, but I do have some problems adjacent to the ones you mention. As someone who struggles with ~parallelizing some tasks (especially when anxious), it would be great to have an up-front check in about how comfortable I am with the format of any technical ~challenge. (And even better to discover there's some wiggle room to accommodate.) For example, I find it very difficult to code my way through a problem and narrate what I'm doing and take feedback while I know I'm being evaluated and the clock's ticking. If the interviewer says something important in the middle of this, I often have to put down any plates I've managed to get spinning (and maybe go offload some adrenaline) and then ask them to repeat before I can even parse the words they said, let alone figure out how they apply to the problem. reply paulcole 13 hours agoparentprevA lot of companies would much rather pass over a great fit than hire a bad fit.

Make sure that you’re actually selecting for what you mean to be selecting for. reply tptacek 12 hours agoprevIt is possible to structure interviews so that: * Every candidate get an almost-identical interview * The interview is not heavily dependent on the investment or natural aptitude of the interviewer * Interviews generate data that can be scored by a rubric * Interviews aren't scored by the interviewer, thus eliminating the intrinsic bias of being in the hot seat with the candidate It looks different for every role. For instance, for a penetration testing role, I've run standardized interviews that involve generating and prioritizing attack surface lists and hypothetical bug lists. The output isn't \"pass/fail\", it's the list of places to test, the list of bugs expected, scheduling/testing budgets, and things like that. If I'm delivering the interview to the candidate, I'm presenting the panel of reviewers not my opinions on the candidate, but what they came up with. The same approach works for general software development (we don't use it here, we have an even fussier process). You can do design exercises, you can work out the dependencies that are going to be needed for a particular complicated project, you can do estimation exercises, you can catalog likely bugs. Review some PRs together. Look at the day-to-day work your team does, and then make the exercise a model of that work. It's not especially easy to do compared to just sitting down and asking a bunch of questions. Moreover, it's very hard to adopt it as a practice, because you have to trust the rubric (iterating on it over time, but using it enough for it to be meaningful) and not override it based on extrinsic considerations (referrals, misgivings about candidate background, &c). But the upside is pretty obvious? Once you have it worked out, you get a repeatable process, something that is naturally geared towards iteration and improvement. Standardize your interviews, generate data, have a panel make the decisions and not the interviewer. You can still play the interview like D&D if you want! reply neuralzen 12 hours agoprevI went through something similar once when I was interviewing for an IT position in the Antarctic (I'd applied for positions at both McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott), and I was supposed to connect to their network simulator to troubleshoot and solve some network issue, but it wasn't working on their end so the interviewer walked me through the scenario, and responded as a DM would. - Quite frustratingly this was my 3rd interview for the position, and although I diagnosed and solved the DM'd scenario of a downed vlan issue in a Cisco environment in ~5 minutes of this off-the-cuff \"simulation\" using DM provided prompts, help menus, and outputs, I did not get the job. I think he penalized me for relying on the DM provided help menus and auto suggest tabbing...which is something anyone on a working simulator would have done. Which was a bummer because even though I was overqualified for the positions and would take a pay cut, I really wanted the experience of living for months in the Antarctic. So while I see the usefulness of this kind of interview, there are noteworthy issues of bias which a real simulator wouldn't begrudge you. reply dkarl 10 hours agoprevI think the \"fake product\" interview is a great format, but it can be done poorly if the setup is unrealistic. I've been on the receiving end of a couple of very bad attempts. In one, which I have described here before, an interviewer asked me to design a system for selling concert tickets. After half an hour of confused back and forth, it emerged that they wanted a network service that replied to requests with unpredictable random integers, which did not repeat, unless the service rebooted and then it was okay if there was an accidental repeat. Needless to say, I started with a lot of assumptions based on the idea of selling concert tickets, and I don't think it reflected poorly on me that it took so long to figure out that the real problem they were judging me by was so radically different from the one they asked me to solve. I had another interview recently which had a similar wrinkle. The interviewer asked for a system to solve a very particular problem, which because of the particulars of the problem would involve receiving very small amounts of data from systems in the field. The interviewer asked multiple times about the cost of data ingress and data storage, and each time I deflected them, saying that it wasn't significant compared to other costs in the system. I was so focused on solving the problem as stated that it didn't dawn on me until later that the interviewer likely had a different problem in mind in which the data was much bigger, and they were evaluating whether I could be sensitive to those costs and design an economical system. Interviews like these are very frustrating, and I don't think they will lead to great hires. You will end up hiring people who solve the problem you have in mind even though you told them to solve a different problem. These programmers will have the same biases and preoccupations as you, which might make them easy to incorporate into your team, but they will probably have the same blind spots as well, which means your team will be less prepared to solve new problems in the future. reply ascar 10 hours agoparentTo be fair, I would say if your task is to design a system it's your job to find out what the person actually wants and not run with assumptions you made based on a bad description. The reality is that you will usually start with a bad description. So I'm not sure if these misunderstandings actually reflect that badly on the interviewer/the question. reply dkarl 10 hours agorootparentI think if they were testing my ability to work through misunderstandings in requirements, they would have been decently impressed that I got from \"system for selling concert tickets\" to \"system for giving out random integers\" in half an hour. But they weren't impressed, they were irritated. Edit: Also I don't think a normal product requirements discovery process involves figuring out that you're actually being asked to solve a different problem in a vastly different domain.

What is meaningful is to sense their level of curiosity - about this job that you are offering, about computing and technology in general. Software development is hard and being good at it requires a level of curiosity. It's probably a concern if someone shows no curiosity in this job or software, though you need to be cautious about how you measure this - did you do a good enough job to explore their level of curiosity? Curiosity does not necessarily reveal itself without careful probing. 6: Discuss the actual work of this job with the candidate. Quickly run through the actual todo list of things that need to be done right now - talk through the hardest of those tasks - how would they approach it? 7: take a leap and employ the person you feel is right - do NOT go into ever deeper analysis, ever more interviews, ever more tests and checks and hoops. No matter how much interviewing you do, you probably won't really know how someone goes in this job until they've been in it 3 or more months. 8: Don't be so risk averse that you don't hire anyone. Do it based on your best guess. it might sound harsh, but do your best and be willing to fire them before their 3 month trial is up if they are not the right person. 9: Take into account enthusiasm - how much does this person want this job? And no, do NOT measure this until the end of the interview process - looking for enthusiasm in a cover letter is like wanting a girlfriend/boyfriend commitment before first date. 10: Pay more than people expect, if you can. $1K less than someone says they want/need reduces first day enthusiasm for the job, $1K more increases first day enthusiasm. Wind the numbers up and down for greater impact. 11: After the interview process is done, talk to referees, analyses interview results apples versus apples. 12: Interview gimmicks, leetcode, abstract questions should be red flags for interviewees. If you're looking for a job and find yourself in a silly interview, be willing to politely call it off and save yourself the time and hassle of dealing with a company that does not know how to recruit software developers. reply frfl 10 hours agoparent> 12: Interview gimmicks, leetcode, abstract questions should be red flags for interviewees.

Admittedly the job market was really quiet but it was eye opening the differences in interview techniques and processes.

I just rolled my eyes thinking FFS Another company the CTO wasn't on the call but had asked to record the last 15 minutes of the interview with questions he'd prepared, I was close to terminating the interview. If he couldn't be assed sitting in on the interview why should I answer questions the interviewer himself didn't understand. One of the questions was \"What is triple D\". I'm an experienced dev, fully aware there are too many acronyms in the industry but had never heard of triple D before, when I googled it after I was thinking FFS, that's just what any competent dev does by default. I guesses data driven development but admitted I wasn't sure. Another interview the principal engineer yawned 3 times when I was talking before I even got to the half way stage, not one apology. I know it's just human nature but to not even acknowledge he was making me uncomfortable reminded me afterwards that it's probably a toxic work culture, which I've been told since is the case from people who worked there. Thankfully at the start of the new year I was offered 3 roles, 2 of them I thought I'd screwed up the interview. The one I accepted, apart from taking on a task to review some code and raise issues with it, I was asked to describe an architecture of some system I'd worked on and enjoyed. I spoke too long, going past the interview time but didn't feel I explained the whole system. I understand interviewing candidates is difficult, I've had to do it a few times in the past but the competency of interviewers and the process to score candidates varies wildly from organisation to organisation.

Aware said its data repository contains messages that represent about 20 billion individual interactions across more than 3 million employees. \"A lot of this becomes thought crime,\" Jutta Williams, co-founder of Humane Intelligence, said of AI employee surveillance technology in general. She added, \"This is treating people like inventory in a way I've not seen.\" Klaus VedfeltDigitalvisionGetty Images Cue the George Orwell reference. Depending on where you work, there's a significant chance that artificial intelligence is analyzing your messages on Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and other popular apps. Huge U.S. employers such as Walmart , Delta Air Lines , T-Mobile , Chevron and Starbucks , as well as European brands including Nestle and AstraZeneca , have turned to a seven-year-old startup, Aware, to monitor chatter among their rank and file, according to the company. Jeff Schumann, co-founder and CEO of the Columbus, Ohio-based startup, says the AI helps companies \"understand the risk within their communications,\" getting a read on employee sentiment in real time, rather than depending on an annual or twice-per-year survey. Using the anonymized data in Aware's analytics product, clients can see how employees of a certain age group or in a particular geography are responding to a new corporate policy or marketing campaign, according to Schumann. Aware's dozens of AI models, built to read text and process images, can also identify bullying, harassment, discrimination, noncompliance, pornography, nudity and other behaviors, he said. Aware's analytics tool — the one that monitors employee sentiment and toxicity — doesn't have the ability to flag individual employee names, according to Schumann. But its separate eDiscovery tool can, in the event of extreme threats or other risk behaviors that are predetermined by the client, he added. Aware said Walmart, T-Mobile, Chevron and Starbucks use its technology for governance risk and compliance, and that type of work accounts for about 80% of the company's business. CNBC didn't receive a response from Walmart, T-Mobile, Chevron, Starbucks or Nestle regarding their use of Aware. A representative from AstraZeneca said the company uses the eDiscovery product but that it doesn't use analytics to monitor sentiment or toxicity. Delta told CNBC that it uses Aware's analytics and eDiscovery for monitoring trends and sentiment as a way to gather feedback from employees and other stakeholders, and for legal records retention in its social media platform. It doesn't take a dystopian novel enthusiast to see where it could all go very wrong. WATCH NOW VIDEO03:38 Generative AI is coming to wealth management in a very big way, says Ritholtz's Josh Brown Jutta Williams, co-founder of AI accountability nonprofit Humane Intelligence, said AI adds a new and potentially problematic wrinkle to so-called insider risk programs, which have existed for years to evaluate things like corporate espionage, especially within email communications. Speaking broadly about employee surveillance AI rather than Aware's technology specifically, Williams told CNBC: \"A lot of this becomes thought crime.\" She added, \"This is treating people like inventory in a way I've not seen.\" Employee surveillance AI is a rapidly expanding but niche piece of a larger AI market that's exploded in the past year, following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. Generative AI quickly became the buzzy phrase for corporate earnings calls, and some form of the technology is automating tasks in just about every industry, from financial services and biomedical research to logistics, online travel and utilities. Aware's revenue has jumped 150% per year on average over the past five years, Schumann told CNBC, and its typical customer has about 30,000 employees. Top competitors include Qualtrics, Relativity, Proofpoint, Smarsh and Netskope. By industry standards, Aware is staying quite lean. The company last raised money in 2021, when it pulled in $60 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Compare that with large language model, or LLM, companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised billions of dollars each, largely from strategic partners. 'Tracking real-time toxicity' Schumann started the company in 2017 after spending almost eight years working on enterprise collaboration at insurance company Nationwide. Before that, he was an entrepreneur. And Aware isn't the first company he's started that's elicited thoughts of Orwell. In 2005, Schumann founded a company called BigBrotherLite.com. According to his LinkedIn profile, the business developed software that \"enhanced the digital and mobile viewing experience\" of the CBS reality series \"Big Brother.\" In Orwell's classic novel \"1984,\" Big Brother was the leader of a totalitarian state in which citizens were under perpetual surveillance. \"I built a simple player focused on a cleaner and easier consumer experience for people to watch the TV show on their computer,\" Schumann said in an email. At Aware, he's doing something very different. Every year, the company puts out a report aggregating insights from the billions — in 2023, the number was 6.5 billion — of messages sent across large companies, tabulating perceived risk factors and workplace sentiment scores. Schumann refers to the trillions of messages sent across workplace communication platforms every year as \"the fastest-growing unstructured data set in the world.\" When including other types of content being shared, such as images and videos, Aware's analytics AI analyzes more than 100 million pieces of content every day. In so doing, the technology creates a company social graph, looking at which teams internally talk to each other more than others. \"It's always tracking real-time employee sentiment, and it's always tracking real-time toxicity,\" Schumann said of the analytics tool. \"If you were a bank using Aware and the sentiment of the workforce spiked in the last 20 minutes, it's because they're talking about something positively, collectively. The technology would be able to tell them whatever it was.\" Aware confirmed to CNBC that it uses data from its enterprise clients to train its machine-learning models. The company's data repository contains about 6.5 billion messages, representing about 20 billion individual interactions across more than 3 million unique employees, the company said. When a new client signs up for the analytics tool, it takes Aware's AI models about two weeks to train on employee messages and get to know the patterns of emotion and sentiment within the company so it can see what's normal versus abnormal, Schumann said. \"It won't have names of people, to protect the privacy,\" Schumann said. Rather, he said, clients will see that \"maybe the workforce over the age of 40 in this part of the United States is seeing the changes to [a] policy very negatively because of the cost, but everybody else outside of that age group and location sees it positively because it impacts them in a different way.\" WATCH NOW VIDEO03:52 FTC scrutinizes megacap's AI deals But Aware's eDiscovery tool operates differently. A company can set up role-based access to employee names depending on the \"extreme risk\" category of the company's choice, which instructs Aware's technology to pull an individual's name, in certain cases, for human resources or another company representative. \"Some of the common ones are extreme violence, extreme bullying, harassment, but it does vary by industry,\" Schumann said, adding that in financial services, suspected insider trading would be tracked. For instance, a client can specify a \"violent threats\" policy, or any other category, using Aware's technology, Schumann said, and have the AI models monitor for violations in Slack, Microsoft Teams and Workplace by Meta . The client could also couple that with rule-based flags for certain phrases, statements and more. If the AI found something that violated a company's specified policies, it could provide the employee's name to the client's designated representative. This type of practice has been used for years within email communications. What's new is the use of AI and its application across workplace messaging platforms such as Slack and Teams. Amba Kak, executive director of the AI Now Institute at New York University, worries about using AI to help determine what's considered risky behavior. \"It results in a chilling effect on what people are saying in the workplace,\" said Kak, adding that the Federal Trade Commission, Justice Department and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have all expressed concerns on the matter, though she wasn't speaking specifically about Aware's technology. \"These are as much worker rights issues as they are privacy issues.\" Schumann said that though Aware's eDiscovery tool allows security or HR investigations teams to use AI to search through massive amounts of data, a \"similar but basic capability already exists today\" in Slack, Teams and other platforms. \"A key distinction here is that Aware and its AI models are not making decisions,\" Schumann said. \"Our AI simply makes it easier to comb through this new data set to identify potential risks or policy violations.\" Privacy concerns Even if data is aggregated or anonymized, research suggests, it's a flawed concept. A landmark study on data privacy using 1990 U.S. Census data showed that 87% of Americans could be identified solely by using ZIP code, birth date and gender. Aware clients using its analytics tool have the power to add metadata to message tracking, such as employee age, location, division, tenure or job function. \"What they're saying is relying on a very outdated and, I would say, entirely debunked notion at this point that anonymization or aggregation is like a magic bullet through the privacy concern,\" Kak said. Additionally, the type of AI model Aware uses can be effective at generating inferences from aggregate data, making accurate guesses, for instance, about personal identifiers based on language, context, slang terms and more, according to recent research. \"No company is essentially in a position to make any sweeping assurances about the privacy and security of LLMs and these kinds of systems,\" Kak said. \"There is no one who can tell you with a straight face that these challenges are solved.\" And what about employee recourse? If an interaction is flagged and a worker is disciplined or fired, it's difficult for them to offer a defense if they're not privy to all of the data involved, Williams said. \"How do you face your accuser when we know that AI explainability is still immature?\" Williams said. Schumann said in response: \"None of our AI models make decisions or recommendations regarding employee discipline.\" \"When the model flags an interaction,\" Schumann said, \"it provides full context around what happened and what policy it triggered, giving investigation teams the information they need to decide next steps consistent with company policies and the law.\" WATCH: AI is 'really at play here' with the recent tech layoffs WATCH NOW VIDEO04:49 AI is 'really at play here' with the recent tech layoffs, says Jason Greer Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Select Personal Finance CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Supply Chain Values Select Shopping Closed Captioning Digital Products News Releases Internships Corrections About CNBC Ad Choices Site Map Podcasts Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

A lot of comments here seem to reflect the idea that “If I’m employed by CompanyY then I’m owned by them.” We are spending a majority of our waking hours working, often, and being trained to believe that an authority’s ownership of technical systems means that not only everything we do with other people via those systems belongs to an employer, but that our inadvertent inclusion of ourselves as humans and not simply task performers is “our own fault.” As humans, our psychological wellbeing rests on a sense of autonomy and these systems directly suppress that. reply sleight42 12 hours agoparentIn some ways, these businesses are akin to the CCCP: they want to own our hearts and minds. They want our whole selves. They want every drop of what they can get out of us. This is so often what they mean when they say that they want people who are \"passionate\" about the work. They want us obsessed and fixated. So they want to more than own us. This isn't all businesses but increasingly this is becoming normalized. reply infamouscow 11 hours agorootparentThis only happens because people allow it. If these same businesses all decided they were going to take your first born as collateral, I suspect a lot of CEOs and chairmen would be swinging from lamp posts (as they should) within a week.

I was browsing LinkedIn this week when I stumbled in this gem: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samfjacobs_last-month-i-was-a... So what he's saying is that he got together with 130+ other CEOs, who combined will probably make millions if not billions, bitching that the people who do the actual grunt work (and make a couple of thousand a month) aren't putting in extra hours or looking at their work mail on weekends. This is so far from reality it's staggering. I work with, and among young developers every day. I'm in my forties and I've done so for most of ny career. Beyond a healthy work life balance they are just sick of working without a fair share of the benefits. These people aren't less prone to work hard, they just don't want to work hard to make extremely wealthy people more wealthy. Some are working less for their employer, and in the meantime are working for themselves to create new disruptive startups. The article says CEOs are \"worried\", but it also states that these workers should fear for their jobs because they are going to be made obsolete by AI. The reality is that small companies can get much more work done in less time than big ones, I have worked for both. The bigger a company gets, the slower it becomes. reply hakfoo 6 hours agorootparentprevI blame a lot of it on the mass adoption of stock-based investment and retirement plans. With defined-benefit pensions and even traditional bond-based investments, the narrative is \"The company has an obligation to me for very specific deliverables, even if that means reduced investor return.\" There's an appropriately adversarial relationship there, which keeps everyone behaving better. With stock investments, people conclude \"my personal success- even survival- is inextricably linked with how good the company looks to Wall Street.\" This incentivizes sycophantism. reply badrabbit 12 hours agoparentprevI don't know what you and others are on about. Work systems have no expectation of privacy. Just how it is. If there was a law where certain types of communication had expectation of privacy, similar to how toilets at work have an expectation of privacy, that'd be nice. Some countries like Germany do have this, it's not always a good thing but if that's what you want then have your state's lawmakers pass that law. I worked in environments where hot mic's and cameras are being used to monitor what we say and do in addition to screen recording, chat monitoring (slack,teams,etc... all have a feature), browser monitoring,etc... and that's just the tip of the ice berg, the layers of shady shit they do, because in their messed up heads employee and slave are not all that different, is endless. Is it illegal? That's the wrong question, the right question is obviously most people don't want any of this because it is against their advantage, but can the government which derives it's power and authority from most people represent them and legislate to begin with? The answer is no it cannot. Can my employer record conversations and video using my work laptop in my home, I mean just petty managers not even for a legitimate inquiry? Yes, they can get away with that. Why is there no law to govern this? Because legislation does not follow the will of the people, it follows the will of fund raisers.

Privacy advocates lost once those towers fell on 2001-09-11. Millennials pushed the aging fossils into the digital world (e-banking/mobile banking, almost everything is digitalized today). Social media changed the way we interact with people. The concept of privacy continues to erode. Gen Z and future generations continuing the trend. Often just giving away their information for likes/impressions/views. Everything has been recorded in one way or another. Relationships also built on “no privacy” (couples often know their phone passcodes …). Children raised in dystopian households where privacy does not exist (parents have access to everything). Future generations conditioned to obey. Now it’s bleeding from private life into the work with invasive AI models deployed to determine seditious activity as deemed by Karen in HR or Jeff from C-level exec suite because he gets a nice kickback (via speaker fees) after getting approached by AI company.

Privacy is indeed important but only up to the limit that it intrudes upon the public accountability necessary for a republic to function. We seem fine with letting governments and large corporations know where we live and how much we pay in taxes yet are hesitant to make this information public due to fear of our fellow citizens.

Same way you can censor as a government and still be all about \"free speech\"!

There is no conspiracy. There won't be a direct \"skip the middleman\" totalitarian level, because governments are too busy chasing their own tails and smelling the farts in a 4-year election cycle to consider anything of a broader scope. Meanwhile, private companies are chasing easy money at the expense of anything that's good, honest or nice, like they always do. We walked into this situation through decades of individual selfishness, aggregated. reply snypher 12 hours agorootparentThis is why I believe that it will be a corporate-ocracy, as the corporation has a much longer lifespan than some political short-term influence. However corporations can also 'fly too close to the flame' in the political sphere.

This seems to be internal corporate coms (corporate email, internal chats) which are not subject to privacy. But the article is very unclear, leaving the reader to assume that they are monitoring social media or something else external to the organization. Internal company communcation channels are open to inspection by the company. Whether that company wants to use AI or pay for agents to read ever internal email is up to them. Want your bosses not to hear you rant about a new corporate policy? Don't sent such comments via company email. reply wolverine876 15 hours agoparent> Internal company communcation channels are open to inspection by the company. That is the current rule (at least in some places), but we're conflating the issue of 'is it legal?' with 'is it right?'. > Whether that company wants to use AI or pay for agents to read ever internal email is up to them. IMHO this argument needs to be buried once and for all, especially on HN. Automation by computer transforms the power of otherwise manual functions. For example, government could always surveil people on the street, but they had to do it manually. With computers, using cameras and facial recognition, they can automatically track the entire population (theoretically, and later if not now). It's not the same thing as manual surveillance of a suspect. > Want your bosses not to hear you rant about a new corporate policy? Don't sent such comments via company email. All that said, I think there are legitimate questions. The mass surveillance enables management to stay ahead of any employee organizing or other political (as in office politics) moves - management knows before the employees themselves realize that lots of people agree with each other. That includes unionization, for example. Yes, if the company allows it then you can communicate through outside channels, but can you reach the whole company there? That is certainly a hinderance to any mass activity. reply arrrg 16 hours agoparentprevAny kind of communication surveillance that goes beyond monitoring for malware and data exhilaration, especially for monitoring performance, would be completely unthinkable at my (German) employer. The employee council would never ever agree to that.

If you're out in public, there is no expectation of privacy, and I (a human) may take a picture of you without breaking any social contract. If someone sets up thousands of facial-recognition cameras in public space you use, that changes the calculus by a lot, despite no change in the underlying lack of expectation of privacy. Quantity has a quality of its own. reply brvsft 17 hours agoparentprev> Depending on where you work, there’s a significant chance that artificial intelligence is analyzing your messages on Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and other popular apps. I don't think it's so unclear, and it sounds like you understand too, internal comms. I know it seems obvious, but a lot of people wouldn't even immediately guess. (My first guess before RTA was Slack or anything like Slack. I always think, when I use Slack, that it cannot be truly private unless I start manually encrypting my messages with coworkers.) I'd guess anything that the business has control over might be a candidate. Even easier if the platform allows for apps to be added on at the company level. reply sandworm101 17 hours agorootparentI still call that unclear as many people use Slack and Teams for non-work stuff, or at multiple jobs. The tone of the article leaves a big open door by not directly stating that this is about monitoring employer-controlled channels rather than all slack or teams traffic. reply ipaddr 12 hours agorootparentprevTell that to any subject the media deems newsworthy. Celebrities are mobbed with photographs or murderers/victims the same. If that's acceptable where does this fit in your worldview reply alwa 14 hours agoparentprevThere’s also the Goodhart-flavored line of argument here: at the moment, part of the sales pitch is that these internal conversation channels provide a meaningful view into staff’s reactions, dynamics, and states of mind. Fire the first few folks for their AI-detected “toxicity,” and one imagines the wiser of their “toxic” friends will find other avenues for their bad behavior. Use sentiment analysis to sound out and reward the true believers in the corporate party line, and suddenly everyone will be Slacking effusive praise for the policies of the dear leaders. The usefulness of this tech would seem to depend a lot on how the place is managed. The obvious worry is that the powers that be will smoke out dissenters, reward toadyism, and punish harmless individual differences. But I can also imagine a constructive management environment, where the “mothership” worries that their feedback from the line staff is getting distorted through layers of management sucking-up and bureaucracy; and imagining this type of analysis as some kind of independent finger on the pulse of the workforce. That seems like it might be useful for making genuinely good decisions. Knowing a lot of true stuff and using it to rule out bad guesses we made based on false impressions, that doesn’t seem so bad to me. Using what you know about an underling to punish them, police them, dehumanize them into nothing more than a pile of scores—that’s neither a new strategy nor one that leads to success. History seems to show that, while that kind of excess may enforce ideological consistency in the near term, it’s intrinsically costly to the health of the [corporation|country|institution]. Over-condition on these signals, like any others, and you just produce a culture of performative compliance and doublespeak-you make the signal useless. And that leaves you in the same anemic information environment that you started in, the sort that tends to conceals problems until they become overwhelming. reply tackypenguin 9 hours agoprevI can only speak to one of the mentioned companies as I worked in this vertical, this has been happening for years across every communication platform. Companies like Symantec, ForcePoint and ProofPoint offer these features out of the box. Setting up rules is as easy as creating a list of keywords or phrases. It is all done under the guise of “treat protection,” meaning if you send a message on teams saying “I’m about to kill this presentation” know a analyst is going look through everything you’ve done in the last 3 months.

We had our chance to push back against company surveillance well over a decade ago, and nobody except privacy advocates like me seemed to give a shit. Some very close friends actually told (after the company for \"saftey reasons\" started using RFID tracking to track our movements throughout the building using our ID cards) that I was being \"paranoid\" by suggesting that at some point it would be openly surveiling employee activities like bathroom breaks, watercooler conversation, etc. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not saying that it's too late, that we've lost, and that we get what we deserve (although such might be true), but I am pessimistic that we could ever reverse this at this late stage point. The cancer has long metastasized and buried itself deeply into every nook and cranny. I don't know if it will work, but this is what I think we should do: 1. Refuse to work at companies that do the most invasive surveillance. This means a lot more of your options are gonna be to work for yourself or for a startup. 2. Spread the word in conversations and stuff (when appropriate. Don't be obnoxious and shove people's face in it cause that won't serve any purpose except alienating them). Seek to educate and inform, not to evangelize or argue (though such things do have their place, but use discretion). 3. Shame the companies who do surveillance. I'm not saying be obnoxious or in-your-face about it because that won't do anything other than make you an asshole, but it's absolutely worth bringing it up in a reasonable, fact-based way when appropriate. I've told recruiters that I won't work forbecause of this. 4. Live your values and try not to do business with these companies, though such can be hard when many have near-monopoly status or a hard-to-avoid position. A full boycott is admirable, but you gotta live your life too. Just try to continually re-evaluate alternatives and vote with your $. Anticipating someone dismissing me as an \"r/antiwork\" person (yes, people on the internet and even Hacker News do routinely make ridiculous assumptions about people based on zero knowledge other than one comment they just read), I actually think ignoring this helps the antiwork people by giving them valid points about the abuse. If you don't think they're right, then you should be very much on my side here because if nothing happens, they will eventually be right. reply neilv 15 hours agoparentI'll add one. (Not just talking about the immediate employee surveillance tech, but various questionable tech we develop and use, and slippery slopes going forward) 5. Consider the development or use of evil tech to reflect poorly upon the people involved. Like in an interview: \"I see you were a developer at Dystopitools...\" or \"I see you were a manager at Megajerco...\" \"I wasn't in the evildoing department\" might be an acceptable explanation. \"I was just following orders\" seems less likely to be an acceptable explanation. Asking for an explanation might be reasonable, depending on the nature of the evildoing. One benefit I imagine of knowing that we'll have to explain ourselves for associating with evil tech is that individuals will even consider that evil tech is a problem. Otherwise, if all people talk about is total comp, tech stacks, and how we spend the gobs of money we get paid, it's easy to forget the inconvenient aspects we don't talk about, like if we're getting paid to do evil. Of course, sometimes people have no choice. But other times we rationalize, \"Sure, I'm actively helping my employer make the world worse, but I have to put food on my family\", when there are less-evil alternatives that also pay enough. (Precedent: I've previously heard multiple executives say they don't want to hire people from particular prestigious tech companies, because, in so many words, they assume that the person learned bad culture at the company, or something is wrong with them for going there in the first place. Adapting that idea to evil tech development and application, and softening it from denylist to being asked to explain, seems worth considering.) Start stigmatizing evils before a particular kind of evil is so ubiquitous that there are no alternatives. reply reaperman 10 hours agorootparentI’d consider salaries and such too. It seems reasonably likely that someone making $200,000 has many options for work and is choosing money over morals.

    "originLink": "https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/",
    "originBody": "Home Resume Atom Feed What it was like working for GitLab February 8, 2024 I joined GitLab in October 2015, and left in December 2021 after working there for a little more than six years. While I previously wrote about leaving GitLab to work on Inko, I never discussed what it was like working for GitLab between 2015 and 2021. There are two reasons for this: I was suffering from burnout, and didn't have the energy to revisit the last six years of my life (at that time) I was still under an NDA for another 24 months, and I wasn't sure how much I could discuss without violating it, even though it probably wouldn't have caused any problems The NDA expired last December, and while I suspect I'm still dealing with the fallout of a burnout, I have a bit more energy to revisit my time at GitLab. I'll structure this article into two main sections: an overview of my time at GitLab based on what I can still remember, and a collection of things I've learned as a result of my work and experiences. Table of contents Before GitLab 2015-2017 2017-2018 2019-2021 What I've learned Scalability needs to be part of a company's culture Make teams more data and developer driven You can't determine what is \"minimal viable\" without data A SaaS and self-hosting don't go well together More people doesn't equal better results I'm conflicted on the use of Ruby on Rails The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization Location based salaries are discriminatory Conclusion Before GitLab Before joining GitLab, I was working for a small startup based in Amsterdam. Like most startups, in the months leading up to my departure the company started to run out of money and had to resort to some desperate solutions, such as renting out part of the office space to cover the costs. At the same time, I felt I had done all the things I wanted to and could do at a technical level. In parallel to this, I was also working on Rubinius in my spare time, and we had considered using it on various occasions, going as far as making sure all our code ran on it without any problems. This also lead to the creation of Oga, an XML/HTML parsing library acting as an alternative to Nokogiri. Unfortunately, the lack of funding combined with various technical problems meant that we never pursued the use of Rubinius further. Because of all these factors, I started looking for a job where I could spend at least some more time working on Rubinius in hopes of making it stable enough for people to use in a production environment. During this time I attended various Ruby meetups in Amsterdam, and helped out with a few Rails Girls workshops. At one of these workshops I ran into Sytse and his wife, and once again at a later workshop or meetup (I think, I can't quite remember as it's been a long time). Through this I learned about GitLab, and developed an interest in working there. Some time in the summer of 2015 I sent Sytse an Email, stating I wanted to work for GitLab and asking if they were willing to sponsor me working on Rubinius one day per week. The conversation and interviews that followed resulted in me starting at GitLab in October 2015 as employee #28. My task was to improve performance of GitLab, and allowed me to spend 20% of my time on Rubinius. During my time I was a part of various teams, had a lot of autonomy, reported to 10 different managers over the years, nearly wiped the company out of existence, built various critical components that GitLab still uses to this day, saw the company grow from 30-something employees to around 2000 employees, and ended up with a burnout. Or as the Dutch saying goes: \"Lekker gewerkt, pik!\" (good luck translating that). 2015-2017 My last day at the company before GitLab was September 30, a Wednesday, followed by starting at GitLab the next day. This meant I went from working in an office five days per week to working remote five days per week. While I had worked from home before, mainly when the trains weren't running due to a tiny amount of snow or leaves on the tracks, it took a bit of adjusting to the new setup. A particular memory from this time that stands out is carrying a bag of groceries home during the day, and realizing how nice it's to do that during the day instead of in the evening after coming home from work. Another memory is taking a nap on my sofa with my cat, of which I took this picture at the time: Yes, those are Homer Simpson slippers. The apartment I was renting at the time wasn't large and only had a small kitchen area, a small living room, and a similarly small attic. This meant that my living room functioned as my bedroom, living room, and office all at once. It wasn't a great setup, but it was all I could afford at the time. Perhaps the expensive Aeron chair had something to do with it. In spite of being an all remote company, GitLab was a social company, with frequent meetups and events taking place over the years. For example, a few weeks after I joined there was a company gathering in Amsterdam, involving various activities during the day and dinners in the evening: Back then you could still fit the entire company in one corner of a restaurant. Not long after, GitLab had its first growth spurt, resulting in somewhere around 100 new employees (I think? My memories are a bit fuzzy at this point). At the next company gathering in Austin in 2016, a single corner in a restaurant was no longer enough: During this time there were also plenty of negative experiences. GitLab suffered from terrible performance, frequent outages (almost every week some), poor management, and many other problems that startups face. This lead to \"GitLab is slow\" being the number one complaint voice by users. Especially on Hacker News people just loved to complain about it, no matter what the original topic (e.g. some new feature announcement) might've been. Of course GitLab was aware of this, and in fact one of the reasons GitLab hired me was to resolve these problems. Resolving these problems proved a real challenge, in particular because GitLab had no adequate performance monitoring infrastructure. That's not an exaggeration by the way: the only service running at the time was a New Relic trial account that only allowed monitoring of one, maybe two servers out of the (I think) total of 15-20 servers we had at the time. This meant that whatever data did come in wasn't an accurate representation, and made measuring and solving performance a challenge. What made solving these problems extra difficult was GitLab's requirement that whatever tooling we'd use had to be available to self-hosted customers, and preferably be open source (or perhaps this was even a hard requirement, I can't remember). This meant I had to not only improve performance, but also build the tools to improve performance in the first place. At the same time, writing performant code (or code that at least isn't horribly slow) wasn't at all considered a priority for the rest of the company. GitLab also had a tendency to listen more to complaints on Hacker News than internal complaints. This lead to an internal running joke that it if you wanted something to change, you'd have better luck complaining about it anonymously on Hacker News instead of bringing it up through the proper channels. What followed was several months of me trying to improve performance, build the tooling necessary for this, try to change the company culture/attitude towards performance such that things would actually improve over time, and deal with GitLab not being happy with the improvements made. I distinctively remember there being at least several video calls in which I was close to yelling at Sytse, though it fortunately never came to that. In spite of these challenges I did manage to build the necessary tooling, and improve performance in various parts (some of which were significant, others not so much). This tooling became an official GitLab feature known as \"GitLab Performance Monitoring\", though it has changed quite a bit over the years. Another tool I built was \"Sherlock\", a heavy-weight profiler meant to be used in a development environment. During this time, GitLab started to realize you can't solve these sort of problems by just hiring one person, especially if performance isn't a priority for the rest of the company. One of the changes this lead to was that instead of reporting directly to Sytse, I would report to a dedicated manager as part of the new \"Performance\" team, and the team had a budget to hire more people. I don't remember exactly what the budget was, but it wasn't much: two, maybe three people I think. This wasn't nearly enough given the total size of the company and it's primary focus being producing as many features as possible, but it was a start. Much of my second year I spent as part of this team, now with a bit more room to breathe. I continued campaigning for more resources and making good performance a requirement for new code, but with mixed results, and of course I and the team as a whole continued improving performance. During this time GitLab also saw its first wave of lay-offs and people leaving by their own will, mainly as a result of GitLab hiring the wrong people in the first place. This meant that GitLab grew from 30-something to (I think) 130-something people, only to shrink back to 80-something people, only to start growing again in the months to come. As for Rubinius: while we tried to get GitLab to work on Rubinius, we never succeeded. Combined with the maintainer of Rubinius wanting to take the project in a different direction and the controversies this lead to within the Ruby community, we ultimately decided to give up on Rubinius, and I stopped working on it entirely. It's unfortunate, as Rubinius had a lot going for it over the years but was ultimately held back by the maintainers running the project in a way different from what was necessary for it to become successful. 2017-2018 After the first rocky 1,5 years, things started to improve. Performance had improved greatly, and GitLab was starting to take it more seriously. Hiring processes were much improved, and like a game of chess GitLab started moving the right people into the right places. The scope of the performance team also changed: instead of focusing on performance in general, the team would focus on database performance and as part of this was to be renamed to the creatively called \"Database team\". With this change also came a bigger budget for hiring people, and infrastructure engineers assigned to help us out with e.g. setting up new databases. A critically important feature I built during this time is GitLab's database load balancer (announced here). This feature allowed developers to continue to write their database queries as usual, while the load balancer would take care of not directing these queries to either a replica or a primary. After performing a write, the load balancer ensures the primary database is used until the written changes are available to all replicas, an act commonly referred to as \"sticking\". The introduction of the load balancer had a significant and positive impact on performance, and I'm certain GitLab would've been in a lot of trouble if it wasn't for this load balancer. What I'm most proud of is being able to introduce this system transparently. To date I've not seen a database load balancer (let alone for Ruby on Rails) that you can just add to your project and you're good to go. Instead, existing solutions are more like frameworks that only provide a small piece of the puzzle, requiring you to glue everything together yourself, often without any form of sticking support. It's a shame we never got to extract it to a standalone library. This period wasn't just one of incredible productivity and improvements, it also marked the lowest and scariest moment of my time at GitLab and my career as a whole: on January 31st, after a long and stressful day of dealing with many issues that continued well into the late evening, I solved GitLab's performance problems removed GitLab's production database by accident. This then lead to the discovery that we didn't have any backups as a result of the system not working for a long time, as well as the system meant to notify us of any backup errors not working either. In the end we did recover, as I had copied the production data to our staging environment about six hours prior as part of of the work I was doing that day, though the recovery process took around 24 hours. While about six hours of data loss is by all accounts terrible, I'm not sure what would've happened if I hadn't made that backup. Suffice to say, my heart skipped a few beats that day, and I'm certain I instantly grew a few extra grey hairs. A recurring source of frustration during this time was GitLab's desire to shard the database, even after the introduction of the database load balancer. Not only did I and the other engineers and my manager believe this to be the wrong solution to our problems, we also had the data to back this up. For example, sharding is useful if writes heavily outnumber reads, but in case of GitLab reads dominated writes by a ratio along the lines of 10:1. Further, the amount of data we were storing wasn't nearly enough to justify the complexity of introducing sharding. I distinctively remember a consultant we'd hired saying something along the lines of \"No offence, but we have customers with several orders of magnitudes more load and storage, and even for them sharding is overkill\". In spite of this, GitLab would continue to push for this over the years, until management made the decision to leave it be, only for GitLab to bring it up again (just using a slightly different name and idea this time) towards the end of my time at GitLab. 2019-2021 Some time in 2018-2019 I transitioned from the database team into a newly founded \"Delivery\" team, as I had grown tired of working on performance and reliability for the last four years. Furthermore, multiple people were now working on performance and reliability, so I felt it was the right time for me to move on to something new. The goal of this new team was to improve the release process and tooling of GitLab, as the state of this was at the time best described as messy. For example, we looked into how much time there was between a commit landing in the main branch and deploying the change GitLab.com. The resulting data showed that on average it would take several days, but in the worst cases it could take up to three weeks. The main bottleneck here was the split between GitLab Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition, both existing as separate Git repositories, requiring manual merges and conflict resolution on a regular basis. This lead to a multi-month effort to merge the two projects into one. While we divided the work into frontend and backend work, and made various teams responsible for contributing their share towards the effort, I ended up implementing most of the backend related changes, with another colleague taking care of most of the frontend work. Together with the rest of the team we made significant improvements to the release process during this period, and we reached a point where we could deploy changes in a matter of hours. While this is nowhere near as quick as it should've been, going from a worst-case of three weeks to a worst-case of maybe a day is a massive improvement. Like the previous periods, this period was not free of turmoil and changes. 2018 was the last year we had a GitLab summit focused on employees, with 2019 and following years following a format more like a traditional conference, aimed more at customers and less at employees. From a financial perspective this was understandable as organizing a gathering of 2000+ people is incredibly expensive. From a social perspective it was a loss, as the more corporate setting of the summits wasn't nearly as fun as the old format. I have fond memories of Sytse dancing on stage in response to a team winning a contest, or Sytse and his wife giving a fitness class while Sytse is wearing a giraffe costume. These sort of goofy events wouldn't happen any more in the following years. Then there was the issue of laptop management: people would request a company Mac laptop and were more or less free to use it how they saw fit, or you'd use your own hardware like me. Over the years GitLab's management started discussions about using software to be able to remotely manage the laptops. A recurring problem in these discussions was that the proposed tools were invasive (e.g. they could be used to record user activity), didn't contain any guarantees against abuse, and feedback from employees (of which there was a lot) would be ignored until key employees started applying pressure on management. The plans would then be shelved, only for the discussion to start all over again months later. What stood out the most was not the proposed changes, but rather the way management handled the feedback, and how the changes in general gave off a vibe of solutions in search of problems to justify their existence. It's worth mentioning that most people involved in these discussions (myself included) understood the need for some form of laptop management (e.g. against theft), but felt that the invasive solutions proposed went too far. GitLab did settle on a laptop management solution using SentinelOne. While GitLab made it a requirement for employees to install this software on hardware used to access GitLab resources, including your personal hardware (or at least was considering requiring that), I (using my own desktop computer) somehow managed to stay under the radar and was never asked to install the software in question. Perhaps because I wasn't using a company issued laptop, GitLab just forgot to check up on me. These cultural changes combined with various changes in my personal life resulted in a loss of motivation, productivity, and an increase in stress, and less consistent working hours. The team's manager (whom I'd consider the best manager I've ever had) also transitioned to a different role, with a newly hired manager now leading the team. I didn't get along well with this manager,The resulting conflict lead to a \"performance enablement plan\", a procedure meant to get things back on track before the need for a \"performance improvement plan\" (PIP). A PIP is meant to be used as a last attempt at improving the relationship between an employee, their work, and their employer. What rubbed me the wrong way was how GitLab handled the PEP: I acknowledged there were areas I needed to improve upon, but I felt that part of the problem was the new manager's way of working. Management assured me that the PEP meant to improve the state of things on both ends, i.e. it wouldn't just focus on me improving but also the manager. That didn't happen, and the PEP focused solely on what I needed to do differently. The PEP was also a bit vague about what requirements had to be met. The original plan was for the PEP to last one month, but by the end of the first month my manager decided to extend the PEP by another month because they felt this to be necessary, the reasons for which weren't well specified. I decided to just go along with it, and after two months passed I completed the PEP and management deemed the results satisfactory. The optimist in me likes to believe I was just the first employee to be put on a PEP and thus management had to figure things out as we went along. The pessimist in me has a far more negative opinion on this series of events, but I'll keep that to myself. After this experience I realized that perhaps it was time for me to leave, as both GitLab and I were heading in different directions, and I was unhappy with the state of things at the time. The opportunity for this presented itself towards the end of 2021: GitLab was going public, and taking into account the time I had to wait before I could exercise my stock options meant I'd be able to leave in December 2021. I couldn't leave earlier due to how stock option taxes worked in The Netherlands at the time: exercising stock options meant having to pay full income taxes (52%) over the difference between the exercise fee and valuation, even if the stock isn't liquid. In my case the amount of taxes would be so high I wouldn't be able to afford it, forcing me to wait until GitLab went public. A few months later the law changed, and you can now choose to pay the taxes either at the time of exercise, or when the stock is liquid. The caveat is that if you defer taxes until the stock is liquid, you pay taxes based on the value at that time, not based on the value at the time of exercising your stock options. This certainly isn't ideal and presents a huge financial risk, but at least you have a choice. And so with my stocks acquired, I left in December 2021 to work on Inko full-time, using my savings to cover my bills. What I've learned With the history out of the way, let's take a look at some things I've learned from my time at GitLab. One thing to keep in mind is that I'm basing these findings on my personal experiences, and as such it's not unlikely I'm wrong in some areas. Scalability needs to be part of a company's culture A mistake GitLab made, and continued to make when I left, was not caring enough about scalability. Yes, directors would say it was important and improvements were certainly made, but it was never as much of a priority as other goals. At the heart of this problem lies the way GitLab makes money: it primarily earns money from customers self-hosting GitLab Enterprise Edition, not GitLab.com. In fact, GitLab.com always cost much more money than it brought in. This naturally results in a focus on the self-hosted market, and many of the performance problems we ran into on GitLab.com didn't apply to many self-hosted customers. What was even more frustrating was that many developers in fact wanted to improve performance, but weren't given the time and resources to do so. Make teams more data and developer driven Another factor is GitLab's product manager driven nature. While some key developers may have had the ability to influence product decisions (given enough screaming and kicking), it was mainly product managers and directors deciding what needed to be implemented. Sometimes these decisions made a lot of sense, other times they seemed to be based solely on the equivalent of \"I read on Hacker News this is a good idea, so we have to build it\". I believe GitLab would've been able to perform better as a company if it adopted a simpler hierarchy early on, instead of the traditional multi-layer hierarchy it has today. In particular, I think the idea of product managers needs to go in favour of giving team leads more power and having them interact more with users. To me, that's ultimately what a \"product manager\" should do: help build the product at a technical level, but also act as a liaison between the team and its users. You can't determine what is \"minimal viable\" without data One of GitLab's core principles is to always start with a \"minimal viable change\". The idea is to deliver the smallest possible unit of work that delivers value to the user. On paper that sounds great, but in practice the definition of \"minimal\" is inconsistent between people. The result is that one team might consider performance or good usability a requirement to something being viable, while another team couldn't care less. In practice this lead to GitLab building many features over the years that just weren't useful: a serverless platform nobody asked for and that was ultimately killed off, support for managing Kubernetes clusters that didn't work for three weeks without anybody noticing, a chatops solution we had to build on top of our CI offering (thus introducing significant latency) instead of using existing solutions, or a requirements management feature that only supported creating and viewing data (not even updating or deleting); these are just a few examples from recent years. To determine what makes something viable, you need a deep understanding of the desires of your target audience. While GitLab does perform user surveys every quarter, and some teams have access to data about user engagement, from what I remember and learned from talking to other former colleagues it seems this data was more incidentally used, instead of being a core part of each team's workflow. A SaaS and self-hosting don't go well together GitLab offers two types of product: self-hosted installations and a software as a service (SaaS) offering. I believe most companies won't be able to effectively offer such a setup, including GitLab. Not only do you get a conflict of interest based on what earns you the most money (as mentioned above), but the two types of setups also come with different requirements and ways of applying updates. For example, for a SaaS you want to be able to deploy quickly and have to handle large amounts of data and workloads taking place on a centralized infrastructure. Given most self-hosted instances tend to be tiny in comparison to the SaaS offering, many of the solutions for the problems you encounter as a SaaS and their corresponding solutions just don't apply to self-hosted installations. This effectively results in two code paths in many parts of your platform: one for the SaaS version, and one for the self-hosted version. Even if the code is physically the same (i.e. you provide some sort of easy to use wrapper for self-hosted installations), you still need to think about the differences. In contrast, when you focus on either a SaaS or self-hosted setup you get to dedicate all your attention to providing the best experience for the setup in question. There are of course exceptions, but they are exactly that: exceptions, and exceptions are rare. More people doesn't equal better results Like many other companies before it, GitLab hired large numbers of people over the years and today employs over 2000 people. I don't know how many of those are developers today, but I'm guessing at least a few hundred based on a quick glance at their team page. It's well known that adding more people to a project doesn't necessarily improve productivity and results (see also \"The Mythical Man-Month\"), and yet almost every western startup with venture capital seems to ignores this, hiring hundreds of developers even if the product doesn't need nearly that many developers. I don't have any data to back this up, but I suspect that most companies don't need more than 20 developers, with some needing 20 to 50 developers, and only a handful needing between 50 and 100 developers. Once you cross the 100 developer mark, I think you need to start thinking about whether the scope of your product(s) isn't getting out of hand before hiring even more people. Note that I'm specifically talking about software developers here. For example, if you're building custom hardware, you'll probably need more people to scale up the production process. Sales and support are also two areas where you generally do benefit from having more people, as these types of work require less synchronisation between people. I'm conflicted on the use of Ruby on Rails GitLab is built using Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and this is a big part of what allowed it to reach the success it enjoys today. At the same time, this combination presents its challenges when the project reaches a large size with many contributors of different experience levels. Rails in particular makes it too easy to introduce code that doesn't perform well. For example, if you want to display a list of projects along with a counter showing the number of project members, it's far too easy to introduce the N+1 query problem by accident. While Rails (or more specifically, ActiveRecord) provides functionality to solve this, it's an opt-in mechanism, inevitably leading to developers forgetting about this. Many of the performance problems solved during my first few years at GitLab were N+1 query problems. Other frameworks have learned from this over the years and provide better alternatives. The usual approach is that instead of being able to arbitrarily query associated data, you have to pass in the data ahead of time. The benefit here is that if you were to forget passing the data in, you'd run into some sort of error rather than the code querying the data for you on a per-row basis, introducing performance problems along the way. Ruby itself is also a choice I have mixed opinions on. On one end, it's an wonderful language I enjoyed using for a little under 10 years. On the other end, it's heavy use of meta programming makes it difficult to use in large projects, even with the introduction of optional typing. I'm not just saying that for the sake of saying it, I experienced it first hand when writing a static analysis tool for Ruby years ago. In spite of all this, I'm not sure what alternative I would recommend instead of the combination of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Languages such as Go, Rust or Node.js might be more efficient than Ruby, but none have a framework as capable as Ruby on Rails. Python and Django might be an option, but I suspect you'll run into similar problems as Ruby and Ruby on Rails, at least to some degree. It would probably help if new web frameworks stopped obsessing over how to define your routing tree, and instead focused more on productivity as a whole. I have some vague ideas on how I'd approach this with Inko, but there's a lot of other work that needs doing before I can start writing a web framework in Inko. The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization This is something I already knew before joining GitLab, having spent a significant amount of time setting up good deployment and testing pipelines at my previous job, but working for GitLab reinforced this belief: you need to be able to deploy your code fast, i.e. within at most an hour of pushing the changes to whatever branch/tag/thing you deploy from. At GitLab it took somewhere around four years for us to get even close to that, and we still had a long way to go. Apart from the obvious benefits, such as being able to respond to incidents more efficiently (without having to hot-patch code to account for your deploys taking hours), there's also a motivational benefit: being able to see your changes live is nice because you actually get to see and make use of your work. Nothing is more demotivating than spending weeks on a set of changes, only for it to take another two weeks for them to be deployed. For this to work, you need to be incredibly aggressive about cutting down deploy times and the time it takes to run your test suite as part of your deployments. Depending on the type of application and the types of services you're testing, you may inherently need a certain amount of time to run the tests. The point here is not \"tests and deployments must never take more than X minutes\", but rather to (as an organization) make it a priority to be able to deploy as fast as your business requirements allow you to. As obvious as this may seem, I suspect many organizations aren't doing nearly as good of a job in this area as they could. Location based salaries are discriminatory The salary you earn at GitLab is influenced by various variables, one of which is location. The influence of your location isn't insignificant either. When you are a company with a physical office and have a need to hire people in specific areas, it might make sense to adjust pay based on location as you otherwise might not be able to hire the necessary people in the required areas. But for an all remote company without a physical office, and legal entities across the whole world, there's no legitimate reason to pay two different people with the same experience and responsibilities different salaries purely based on where they live. To illustrate: when I left GitLab my salary was around €120 000 per year, or around €8500 per month, before taxes. For The Netherlands this is a good salary, and you'll have a hard time finding companies that offer better and let you work from home full time. But if I had instead lived in the Bay Area, I would've earned at least twice that amount, possibly even more. Not because I am somehow able to do my job better in the Bay Area, or because of any other valid reason for that matter, but because I would be living in the Bay Area instead of in The Netherlands. No matter how you try to spin this, it's by all accounts an act of discrimination to pay one person less than another purely based on where they live. Think about it: if a company pays a person less because of the color of their skin or their gender, the company would be in big trouble. But somehow it's OK to pay a person less based on their location? As for how to solve this, for companies it's easy: just pay based on the position's requirements, not the location of the applicant. It doesn't matter whether you're paying somebody in the Bay Area $100 000 per year, or somebody in the Philippines, because the cost for you as a business is the same. For employees my only advice is to try and negotiate a better salary, but this may prove difficult as companies paying based on locations also tend to be stubborn about it. I hope one day our laws catch up with this practice. A company that seems to do a good job at this is the 0xide Computer Company. Instead of paying employees based on their location, 0xide pays employees the same amount (see this post for more details), something I deeply admire and believe more companies should do. Conclusion Looking back, my time at GitLab is a mix of both incredibly positive and negative experiences. I'm incredibly proud of the achievements the various teams I was on made, and the people I got to work with, but I'm also saddened by the last year or so souring an otherwise great experience. I don't have any regrets working for GitLab, and would do it all over again if I could, just a little differently thanks to the benefit of hindsight. I also still recommend it as a company to work for, because in spite of its flaws I think it does much better than many other companies.",

If you're hired, you get a US level salary, whether you're in San Francisco or Poland or Indonesia. These positions are phenomenally competitive.

The cost for you as business is NOT the same. Start from the taxes part, that 100k is what the employee gets but the cost for the business is higher depending on the country/area because they also pay tax on top, social benefits etc. Also need to have in many cases a local business, doesn't matter if that is virtual etc, since they need to adhere to local laws thus having resources supporting that etc. So while I'm on the employee side here as I'm also working on a multinational coorp with global role yet paid with local standards, there is more than meets the eye reply mjr00 1 hour agorootparentyep. People vastly underestimate how difficult the logistics of \"pay an employee for services\" can be, particularly when you don't have a legal corporate presence in the country where the employee resides.

The reality is that what company chooses to pay is the minimal amount they can get a candidate to accept for that location. If the candidate had other better offers, then they can either reject the offer or propose a higher counter-offer. If the company received a counter-offer and chose to accept it, then this amount becomes the new minimal amount. Over a period of time, if there are enough counter-offers (or rejections), this continues to increase. Since, the two (or however many) locations don't necessarily have the same demand or supply, it's inevitable that some location will end up with much higher compensation than others.

You're asking for equal pay for equal work. If all your team members are paid in full but you, in spite of doing the exact same work, are paid a fraction of what they are paid, then something is terribly off. Your contribution to your team does not depend on where you're currently located. How much time you waste on commute does not change the expectation placed on your output.

Bidding too high is wasteful to your resources, too low makes it impossible to compete in higher pay areas, and middle ground is the worst of both worlds: loose out on high pay areas, be wasteful in low pay areas. I hope future generations will better understand that accumulating wealth should not be the goal of life. reply ganarajpr 1 hour agoprevCompanies attempting to pay an engineer according to location, in my opinion, is another kind of discrimination. You are supposed to pay an employee based on his/her abilities, not her location. We have rules in govts that companies should not discriminate against employees based on sex, religion, sexual orientation etc etc.. But it is fair to discriminate the salary of an employee based on location? For ex: I know a few friends who have moved from Europe to Asia with the same role and are getting paid less compared to what they were getting paid in Europe. Its the same role, its the same person, but getting paid less just because of location ? reply patcon 1 hour agoparentI disagree. I believe a company should pay based on ability of employees to have comfort and wellness, not some universal measure of value (which I believe to be impossible). What you are advocating for inadvertently breaks community and exacerbates gentrification and destruction of social fabric via inequality. Location matters. reply randomdata 50 minutes agoparentprev> You are supposed to pay an employee based on his/her abilities, not her location. You are supposed to pay them the minimum amount it takes to get them to show up to work. When someone moves to a less competitive market, where getting another job is harder, then they are more likely to show up for lesser pay. And remember that a country may have a less competitive market, even if the workers are remote and not seemly bound by a local market, because governments often love to put up huge roadblocks when it comes to international hiring. If you are being paid less than you were in another country doing the same job for the same employer, this is almost certainly why you have agreed to take a pay cut. reply stavros 34 minutes agorootparentExactly. This isn't a \"cost of living\" adjustment, it's a \"we're lucky you have fewer options, so we don't have to pay as much\" adjustment. If I get hired in such a company, I'm moving to SF or Zurich the next day. reply hawk_ 1 hour agoparentprevDiscrimination is around things that an individual can't choose (religion being the weird elephant in the room). Fair or not, this isn't discrimination. reply oldkinglog 1 hour agorootparentIn the UK, the Equality Act (2010) protects: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership (in employment only), pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation. Pregnancy, maternity, marriage, civil partnerships and gender re-assignment are usually chosen by individuals, not forced upon them. reply Scarblac 1 hour agorootparentDisagree on gender re-assignment, people don't choose to have gender dysphoria just like they don't choose sexual orientation. reply usr1106 49 minutes agorootparentprevPregnancy and maternity are desired by the society as a whole. So they might receive some positive discrimination.

For instance, my company is Canadian, and we are eligible for significant tax credits through SR&ED[0] for software developers. If a software developer moved their permanent residence to outside Canada, even if we could magically pin exchange rates to pay them the CAD equivalent in local currency, it would be a significantly different financial impact on the company as they aren't eligible for that program. I'm not an expert, but I imagine there are many equivalent programs in every country, state, and even municipality. It works both ways, anyway. If those friends had moved from Thailand to Switzerland, would it be discrimination to pay them more?

Where is that stated? As a company you need certain abilities, and you pay whatever the market decides these abilities are worth, and nothing more. Depending on location, the market will set a different price on these abilities, so you pay different. reply ako 49 minutes agoparentprevYou could also argue that difference in pay is less discriminatory. You are paying employees to have the same quality of life, same type of housing, same opportunity to provide for family, send your kids to the same type of schooling. These things cost differently in different countries, so require different income. reply ta8645 1 hour agoparentprev> You are supposed to pay an employee based on his/her abilities, not her location. I don't believe that is a legal requirement, anywhere. Remuneration is based on many factors, which can include the cost of living. A company will not be able to hire someone in New York City, for the same price as someone in a less expensive jurisdiction. This isn't discrimination, it's simple economic reality. reply samsonradu 1 hour agorootparentIt s based on suply and demand indeed. The legal requirements might affect minimum pay. reply filleokus 39 minutes agoparentprev> You are supposed to pay an employee based on his/her abilities, not her location. I don't think this make any sense on so many levels. First, \"abilities\" are not a good way to think about wages. If you hire a neurosurgeon to do your gardening, you won't pay them more than a run of the mill gardener. Rather, you as the employer compete against other employers on different markets in a fairly classical supply and demand situation. The \"abilities\" of an compliance expert with tech skills did not change much when GDPR was introduced, but as all EU companies scrambled to figure out the regulation (and the DPO role was popularised by fiat), the compensation went way up. If the employee can participate in e.g the SF labour market, you have to pay a competitive salary in that market, if not you don't have to. As long as there are barriers, e.g a on-location worker in SF has more opportunities for whatever reason, the location premium makes sense. To take your example in the opposite direction. Let's say a east-european company want to expand into the US and open up a sales engineering office in SF, and want their best sales engineers to go work their, it would be completely insane to not raise their wage. \"We pay people after ability here you have 40k USD, have fun finding housing\". reply neoberg 1 hour agoparentprevI agree with this in theory but I can't see how it will work in practice. There isn't a global \"value of ability\" to base the pay on. It's valued differently in every location. reply hw 1 hour agoparentprev> Companies attempting to pay an engineer according to location, in my opinion, is another kind of discrimination. You are supposed to pay an employee based on his/her abilities, not her location. So you’re saying, we should be paying engineers in Europe and in the US the same as an engineer in LATAM or India or Asia that has the same level of experience and skill. The only way to be non discriminatory is to have a standardized formula of compensation that takes into account cost of living (rent, food, healthcare, taxes etc) where the final take home pay in locations around the world are equivalent - which I believe should be the case at most companies reply jblox 1 hour agoparentprevYeah I absolutely hate that. I get why they do it from a business point of view but as an engineer, I'm instantly put off when I see something along the lines of \"up to $x (depending on location)\". reply DeathArrow 7 minutes agoprev>For example, sharding is useful if writes heavily outnumber reads If you distribute your data carefully and don't need to do joins across shards, I fail to see how sharding doesn't help with reads. reply jumploops 1 hour agoprev> The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization I've found this to be one of the most important metrics (if not the most important) for maintaining developer velocity as a startup scales. Context switching is one of the most expensive operations in a developer's day-to-day work, and also one of the most ignored. Managers love to build team schedules around their personal schedules, but this is often disruptive to ICs' \"maker schedules.\" Many orgs identify this and focus on the scheduling cost w.r.t. context switching, but the build-to-deploy time is equally (if not more) important for developer ICs. reply higeorge13 9 minutes agoprevI wish the ‘More people doesn't equal better results’ would be put into every manager door and desk.

I cannot say anything else than gitlab performance and UI being much better. I was permanently complaining about bitbucket, but very happy with gitlab most of the time. They had rather frequent partial outages, but resolution was always quick. Maybe starting 1 year ago I noticed gitlab.com reponse times going down. It's not that things hang or are super slow, but they seem to consistently take 2 seconds more than what they used to. (The number is a complete guess, I have no measurements either before or after.) It's still usable, but no longer the pleasant experience it used to be. reply usr1106 57 minutes agoparentAnd following up to myself: Being able to work from where I happen to live and I have thought about whether I would like to work for them. That it's a good product would certainly be a motivation. However, frequent incidents being resolved fast must be incredibly stressful for the staff.

Companies aren't gods charged with dispensing fair wages to us mortals. They are participants in the capitalist market. And in that market, all prices are a matter of negotiation. In any transaction, the buyer wants to pay as little as possible, and the seller wants to earn as much as possible. This isn't evil or greedy. It's a basic incentive that comes from the fact that people/companies/literally everyone prefers to have more money than less money. Thus, your company wants to pay you as little money as possible, and you want them to pay you as much as possible. The same is true when the roles are reversed and you're the one in the buyer position. For example, when you're shopping, you want to pay as low a price as possible, and the seller wants to charge as high a price as possible. Again, all prices are a matter of negotiation.. Power in a negotiation comes down to your BATNA, i.e. your best alternative if negotiation fails. Put simply, whoever cares the least has the most power. In a capitalist market, that BATNA for the buyer is the next cheapest option. The next furniture store that's selling this couch for cheaper. The next adequately qualified software engineer in the Bay Area who's selling their services for cheaper. And the BATNA for the seller is obviously the next most generous spender. The customer who's willing to pay a little more. The company that's willing to pay higher salaries. If it sounds like I'm conflating two concepts by comparing customers with employers, and businesses with employees, it's because you've been brainwashed into thinking these things are different. They're not. When money changes hands, whoever receives it is the business. Whoever pays it is the customer. That means, in the relationship between you and your employer, you are the business selling a service, and they are a customer paying for your service. Your salary is just a price. Your resume was an advertisement. Posting it everywhere was marketing. Interviewing was your sales pitch. As an employee, you are a business. (Someone just came along and renamed all the terms to confuse you.) Which raises the question: Why on earth would your customer voluntarily pay a higher price than they need to? If all the stores in your area are cheap, why would they pay you more for your services than your neighbor is asking for? When you travel to a country cheaper than yours, do you pay every restaurant, store, and taxi driver the same way you would at home? No, you don't. Because that would be foolish. You pay local rates, which are less. That's the same thing companies are doing when they pay lower salaries in cheaper areas. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I have been collecting these stations for over ten years and the list has grown and shrunk over those years. Each radio station linked below starts with the link to the home page for the station. This is usually then followed by links to playlists (.m3u, .pls) that when clicked will launch the station in you default player. Then you will find links to the stream (sometimes ending in .mp3, .acc, .ogg, .opus or a ;) that will play in your web browser when clicked. There will be repeats of playlists and stream links when there are multiple different channels of music or multiple different speed streams to choose from. In some cases there are links, that when clicked, will bring you to the SHOUTcast or Icecast server for the station. Try clicking on links there to start the station playing. If you have difficulty playing a stream, try to go to the station's home page and try to play the streams from there. Please do not be annoyed if some of the stations do not work, I recently verified all of them, and they do go up and down on a regular basis. Give a station a try another day if it is not working now. If you have any corrections or additions, please let me know in an email and I will consider including them on this page. My email address can be found by going to my contact Michael Walden page at: https://mw.rat.bz/contact.htm . The links on this list are not in any particular order, they are mostly in the order that I became aware of them (oldest first, newest at the end). Note: You may want to check out my Desktop Streaming Radio Players page at https://mw.rat.bz/players/ to get a player program for these streams. You can set one of them up to be your default streaming radio player. There are currently about 60 stations on this list. -=[ The Links ]=- Kohina - Old school game and demo music (Electronic, Arcade, Atari, C64, PC, etc.) https://Kohina.com Kohina Web Player https://Player.Kohina.com/streamplayer/ https://Kohina.DuckDNS.org/streamplayer/ http://Kohina.DuckDNS.org:8000/stream.ogg.m3u (112k ogg) (France) http://Kohina.DuckDNS.org:8000/stream.ogg https://Kohina.DuckDNS.org/playlist_https.m3u (112k ogg) (France) (port 80) https://Kohina.Brona.dk/icecast/stream.ogg http://www.Deliancourt.org:8000/stream.ogg.m3u mirror (salacryl) http://www.Deliancourt.org:8000/stream.ogg http://player.kohina.com/icecast/stream.aac.m3u http://Player.Kohina.com/icecast/stream.aac http://Player.Kohina.com/icecast/stream.opus http://Player.Kohina.com/icecast/stream.ogg Keygen-FM (on SHOUTcast: MOD, Tracker, Chiptune, MODs, Keygen)https://The.NAG.Zone/audio/nag-the-station/ https://The.NAG.Zone/audio/webradios/ Nerds and Geeks: THE STATION [NerdsandGeeks.de] Playlist http://yp.SHOUTcast.com/sbin/tunein-station.pls?id=1694055 Nerds and Geeks: THE STATION [NerdsandGeeks.de] - 96 kbps MP3 Stream http://NerdsandGeeks.de:2808/index.html?sid=1 http://195.201.9.210:2808/index.html?sid=1 http://NerdsandGeeks.de:2808/stream/1/ Nerds and Geeks: THE STATION [NerdsandGeeks.de] - 128 kbps MP3 Stream http://NerdsandGeeks.de:2808/index.html?sid=2 http://195.201.9.210:2808/index.html?sid=2 http://NerdsandGeeks.de:2808/stream/2/ SpriteLayer Classic Video Game Radio - Video game music from the 80s to 2000. https://www.SpriteLayerRadio.com SpriteLayer Video Game Radio - Playlist https://SpriteLayerRadio.com/public/spritelayer_video_game_radio/playlist.pls SpriteLayer Video Game Radio - all (128 kbps MP3) http://SpriteLayerRadio.com/listen/spritelayer_video_game_radio/all http://SpriteLayerRadio.com:8010/all SpriteLayer Video Game Radio - shout_all (128 kbps MP3)Webradios https://Woolyss.com/chipmusic-webradios.php Woolyss - Tracking (music) > Webradios https://Woolyss.com/tracking-webradios.php ( From https://Info.Woolyss.com Contact Author at: Jerry) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=[ SHOUTcast Genre Searches ]=- Find more similar demoscene and computer music streams under the following genre.

We usually include a listener request as one of the three candidates in the election. We’re a friendly community, in my obviously biased opinion.

One interesting aspect of this transition was the different approaches to DNSSEC signing by Verisign and Cloudflare. Whereas Verisign uses offline signing with RSA (algorithm 8) and NSEC3, Cloudflare generally uses online signing with ECDSA (algorithm 13) and NSEC. Although the parties agreed to transition using only RSA, we wanted to test the statement in RFC 8901 (\"Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models\") that says \"NSEC and NSEC3 can be used by different providers to serve the same zone.\" After extensive testing by both parties, we found no reasons why it shouldn't work, and this approach was used for the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is likely to be the first time that a signed zone of such significance was operated using NSEC and NSEC3 at the same time.

It seems to me this is DNSSEC working as designed, and being remarkably flexible in doing so. Sometimes things _should_ be difficult to do. reply jpgvm 15 hours agorootparentYeah I hate that people can't acknowledge that friction is sometimes intentional. Not everything -should- be easy. For example I designed a system at a previous company that used Shamir's Secret Sharing to protect a very very important root key. We used an intermediate of this key for most operations but it came time to rotate it and folks were surprised by the ceremony involved in doing so. i.e the root key was decrypted using X of N members of the SSS group, a new intermediate generated and the special NUC that was designed for this purpose returned to it's safe (which was also using a Yubikey as like a mini-HSM too). Those keys protected very important PII and I deemed this the minimum necessary friction, ideally I would have went further if that was tenable. Some things really should be hard and that hardness should be proportional to how horrible the implications of someone unauthorized doing that thing. reply blibble 11 hours agorootparent> Not everything -should- be easy. the entirety of .nz probably wouldn't agree with you when they had a 2 day outage due to a slight DNSSEC misconfiguration reply pas 11 hours agorootparent??? at best that means there's more need for practice, testing, better processes, and so on. it does not mean everything should be easy.

You think the people who own the computers you use can't see whats happening on them? reply gunapologist99 13 hours agorootparentIsn't that the whole value proposition of Cloudflare? Nearly all traffic (in terms of volume) gets swallowed by CloudFlare and never approaches most instances: DDoS attacks swallowed whole, WAF rules block illegitimate traffic (which is, in most cases, the vast majority of traffic to dynamic endpoints or, frequently, non-existent endpoints, if you've ever tailed webserver logs), and Cloudflare-caching handles most of the remainder for static and cacheable files -- leaving those servers with a mostly-sanitized and far lower volume of traffic. If you're using edge workers, even less traffic hits your servers. But, yes, out of the remaining traffic that enters AWS/GCP/Azure's network, they certainly can see what's happening on those machines if they care to look. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 7 hours agorootparentYeah, that is one of the main value props of Cloudflare. They just slap you with scale. Entire classes of problems like DDOS just become non issues when you front with them.

What you’re both talking about is what happens when someone uses Cloudflare’s CDN, enables their managed CAPTCHA feature, and directs their web traffic through it. This is about DNS, which is a separate service at a lower level. Agencies would have to contract with Cloudflare separately to use the CDN, and each contract is a separate competition where a different part of the government using Cloudflare for a different service would not be considered when reviewing bids. reply jmclnx 19 hours agoprev [11 more] Great, now I will start getting those awful Captchas with .gov sites :( At least in this case, maybe people who are both deaf and blind (yes I knew some) will have a place to complain to since there are federal laws about disabilities. reply profmonocle 19 hours agoparentThey've just taken over authorative DNS.

I'm surprised with how well the MVP has worked and would love to hear any feedback or suggestions! JoshTriplett 4 hours agoThis sounds incredible, and I'd love to try it! A few immediate thoughts: As a student, I don't care about a two-sided platform (which is what it looks like you're trying to build). I want to sign up for vetted piano lessons through your site, and purchase a USB midi adapter that you recommend. As a short-term MVP, perhaps point people to a known-working adapter on a site with an affiliate program. Long-term you might consider finding a company willing to sell one white-label and put your logo and website on it, but that's a lot less important than everything else you're building so put it off for a while. Also, for the first handful of lessons and for subsequent practice, it'd be awesome if you had automated, pre-recorded lessons available, to get the basics down, or to train things like reading sheet music at speed. reply semi-extrinsic 1 hour agoparentRegarding \"USB MIDI adapter\": Actually USB MIDI is the lowest common denominator for MIDI keyboards. If you pick up any used MIDI keyboard less than 10 years old, it will have USB. Something in the $40-$60 range on Craigslist is perfect. The big choice for the beginner (or anyone) is how many keys do you want, and have space for? It goes all the way from 25 keys up to 88. Then going up in price, models will start to include (in random order) old 5-pin MIDI in and out, velocity sensitive keys, (semi-)weighted keys, aftertouch, inputs for foot controllers, pads/knobs/faders for controlling a DAW, built-in sequencers, external sync in/out, CV and gate outputs for interfacing with modular gear, etc.. reply Bewelge 39 minutes agoprevThis is such a cool concept, congrats on shipping! I've been developing a webMIDI app myself for the past couple of years [0] and adding a multiplayer feature is something I've been eyeing for a while. May I ask how good the latency is? Some feedback on the landing page: - As others already pointed out, a video example showing the app would be really helpful. - I think allowing visitors to try out the piano and only prompting to login when trying to access the remote features would work best - All those buttons that are clickable/selectable but don't do anything when clicked were a little confusing. On the app: - Connecting the keyboard worked flawlessly (and without any permission prompt). But I'd add some indication that a MIDI device is connected - Pressing the keys using my mouse doesn't produce any sounds - Pressing keys on my MIDI keyboard (Yamaha P120) will cause the keys to be selected indefinitely, so I can only ever press them once. Somehow the noteOff events don't seem to be getting registered. Make sure you also register noteOn events with velocity = 0 as a noteOff event (although I don't believe that that's the issue here) and I would suggest calling noteOff yourself if you register a noteOn event for a note that's already playing. That way you can prevent keys from getting stuck. - I wouldn't hide keys automatically based on screen size. It does look better but imagine someone trying to play this on a tablet/phone where they can't change the scaling Again, really cool concept and good luck with further development!

I built a setup with OBS, Synthesia and an old Logitec web cam I had lying around (these were impossible to get new at the time). I transmitted a frontal video of the player from the laptop cam, a top-down view of the center section of the keyboard (the cam angle was not wide enough for the whole), and the virtual keyboard from Synthesia. I had three different layouts of these elements in OBS, that could be switched by pressing the space bar. On the audio side I sent a mix from the laptop mic for voice plus the direct audio from the e-piano. Served us well for the time. One constraint that improved solutions probably don't have now was that teachers could not decide on a video conferencing software, so my setup-up needed to be independent. This almost made OBS a no-brainer, because of the virtual cam support. reply Ferret7446 7 hours agoprevFrom what I've heard MIDI controllers are not good for learning piano. You really want weighted keys and a full 88 keys otherwise you won't learn the right habits or build finger strength.

IMO. To that end, I think a crappy plastic MIDI keyboard can do a better job than a steinway if it is easier to acquire and accommodate. Being at hand is more important than being just right at this stage. I say this as a music major, but it is not in any way a universal opinion to be sure. reply turtlebits 3 hours agoparentprevMIDI doesn't automatically mean no weighted keys.

Your fingers are already plenty strong enough for weighted keys (especially once you learn how to take advantage of gravity in your technique). But weighted keys are crucial for building coordination. The resistance of the keys helps you calibrate the connection between your touch and the sound produced. You want both kinesthetic and aural feedback. reply Rodeoclash 7 hours agoparentprevThe thing is, all pianos feel different. It's one of the downsides of the instrument is that you often end up having to play whatever piano is at the event (barring the aforementioned digital pianos that are portable). If all you have is a digital keyboard, don't let that stop you for learning it! reply jerkstate 5 hours agoparentprevmy opinion (as a dad with kids learning piano, who learned piano as a kid) playing with 88 weighted keys is like learning to write cursive with a fountain pen - maybe artistically interesting, but doesn't matter for the core skills. My kids are learning on 61 key unweighted boards and they're learning melody, rhythm, notation, theory, and all of the things that are about music, not about the particular physiological requirements that a machine originally built in the 1600s imposed. reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentWeighted keys aren't about requirements from the 1600s, they're about being able to achieve an extremely wide and sensitive dynamic range. Unweighted is fine if you're making synth sounds. And of course for understanding the things you've listed. But you can't actually play emotionally expressive piano music on them -- not in the style of classical or jazz. If you tried to play the Moonlight Sonata first movement, it would sound terrible, because the dynamic shadings couldn't be done. I'm not really sure how you've determined what \"core skills\" are. Sure, if your kids are only going to spend a couple years learning the very basics, and then move onto other things, then it's fine. But the heart and soul of piano music is in the precise touch to generate the dynamic sensitivity. If you want them to learn how to be emotionally expressive through music, playing either classical or jazz, weighted keys are essential. It's not piano otherwise -- it's a synth. (And going from unweighted to weighted isn't trivial. It's an entirely different muscle memory that needs to be developed. They're fundamentally different instruments.) reply jdietrich 1 hour agorootparent>But you can't actually play emotionally expressive piano music on them -- not in the style of classical or jazz. Yes you can, and yes it is more-or-less trivial. With a small amount of deliberate practice, you can learn to produce a full and finely-gradated dynamic range on either a piano-weighted or a semi-weighted keybed. It's a one-dimensional mechanical skill that just isn't particularly difficult relative to, say, an oboeist's reed control or a violinist managing the very complex relationship between bow and string. If I say \"you just don't press quite as hard\" it'll sound like I'm being glib, but that's literally all there is to it, because physics. Strings players choose from a wide range of string tensions and woodwind players choose from a wide range of reed stiffnesses, based purely on their own personal preference. Some prefer something soft and pliable that responds to the lightest touch, others prefer something that fights back when you dig in. It's an accident of history that mechanical pianos fall into a relatively narrow range of weightings, not a deliberate choice on the part of pianists or piano makers - the range of options are limited by the mechanics of an escapement and hammer. Pianists overwhelmingly prefer weighted keybeds out of habit, but more generalist keyboard players will often prefer a semi-weighted keybed for versatility. You can play gigs or sessions with either and you're the only one who's going to notice. Calling either choice wrong is just dogma. reply jerkstate 1 hour agorootparentprevI can play the first movement and it sounds pretty good to my ear, with a pedal.

The other large part was that my teacher did not spend much time on theory with me. Also, when recitals came around it was a big shift to playing on a grand piano with real weighted keys, and that, coupled with the nerves of playing in front of an audience, often led to mistakes. I think the weighted keys help you feel more physically connected to the instrument with more of your body.

It’s more accurate to say that happiness is akin to calmness or contentment, the lack of strong emotions. Personally, after watching a funny comedian, I feel more emotionally exhausted than happy - which makes sense to me from this perspective. reply zogrodea 17 hours agoparentYour second paragraph reminds of Aristotle's counter to Plato in one instance. The debate was about whether media (poetry, plays) should be allowed. Plato thought, no, because poetry and other media burden the audience with emotions that have no value in practical life. Aristotle countered that the poem has a \"payoff\" which relieves these emotions generated by reading the poem, so that the audience feels less emotionally burdened by the time it ends. I particularly like R. G. Collingwood's historical commentary on their debate in The Principles of Art (published 1938), where he talks about our addiction to entertainment and being trapped in a vicious cycle (\"one more episode\"). reply keiferski 17 hours agorootparentYep, and this is called catharsis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis For more on Plato's thoughts on aesthetics: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-aesthetics/ I wouldn't say he was critical of poetry because they weren't \"valuable in practical life\" as Plato certainly wasn't a pragmatist. It's more that he thought the imitative arts didn't give true knowledge (i.e., a poet talking about war doesn't have actual true knowledge of war) and that poetry/literature often has bad role models that shouldn't be imitated by real people. I used to find Plato's criticisms absurd and difficult to understand, but as media becomes more realistic, more influential, and more willing to display unethical characters in a sympathetic light for the sake of \"the market\" or \"storytelling\" I think he is probably correct at some level. I'm thinking of the countless shows which glorify violence, cheating, drug smuggling, and so forth. It's not clear that glorifying these things in the media leads to them being acted out in real life, but even if it doesn't: that still seems like a massive sense of cognitive dissonance, wherein the cultural products of a society are only tenuously related to its real-world values. reply throwup238 16 hours agorootparentI think Plato's argument is best illustrated by the TV show How TV Ruined Your Life by Charlie Brooker (the creator of Black Mirror). Each episode covers different topics like technology, love, etc. which television has completely warped. It's not even about glorifying some of the worst aspects of humanity, it's about all of our expectations. My favorite concrete example is child birth: it's always portrayed as a quick procedure in the vast majority of TV shows, less than a few minutes from water breaking to the baby popping out. Nothing could be further from the truth and a lot of women get a nasty surprise when they get pregnant and an OBGYN explains what to expect. reply PaulDavisThe1st 15 hours agorootparentConsider, in a related vein, what happens when things are just omitted. Miscarriages are an extremely common phenomenon for humans. Yet while our stories about reproduction feature endless variations of the conception, pregnancy, childbirth and child raising parts of the process, very little mention is ever made of miscarriages. As a result, when they happen (which they do a lot), they come as a real shock for people who have not otherwise been exposed to this detail of the human condition, even though they are really quite normal, perhaps even mundane. reply Vecr 7 hours agorootparentEvery single FDA vaccine prescribing guide says \"All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

I don't know if Plato does this too, but I'm pretty certain you're making a mistake here. Most (almost all, I would argue) of the shows that feature violence, cheating, drug smuggling etc. present them as cautionary tales: doandwill probably happen to you, even if there's a brief period between when you think things are going well. Human cultures are full of cautionary tales, and in this sense these \"countless shows\" are not glorifying their themes, but continuing in the tradition of telling us \"don't do this (probably)\". reply keiferski 15 hours agorootparentThis is a common rebuttal, but I don’t think it holds up under much scrutiny. People idolize the charismatic protagonists, they don’t look at them as cautionary tales. The reaction is “that’s cool,” not “I guess he didn’t win in the end.” Fight Club is a good example. Tyler Durden is clearly the most charismatic character and has “inspired” a whole lot of viewers, even if he loses in the end. reply PaulDavisThe1st 15 hours agorootparentIt is difficult to deal with examples like Fight Club, where the audience simply interprets the entire story in a different way than the author. Should an author be responsible when they create a what they intend to be a cautionary tale only to find that it is interpreted as a celebratory tale? reply andrewflnr 15 hours agorootparent\"Responsible\" is a highly overloaded word, but if nothing else it's a call for writers to be cautious in how they present things. I'm working on a story with a (mostly) sympathetic protagonist who does some awful things and ultimately undergoes moral meltdown. One of my beta readers pointed out that my ending, bleak as it was, sort of rewarded the protagonist by giving her catharsis and some vindication, if not an actual happy ending. I took that as the top priority from that round of feedback and made sure to tweak the framing. Did I succeed? Maybe. Can I absolutely prevent people from taking the wrong message? No. But I can try, and at least cut off the obvious routes to misinterpretation, learning from previous examples (Fight Club is actually not too far off in spirit). I think this is a moral responsibility of anyone making art, especially stories, for consumption by others: you at least have to try, where \"try\" includes a good faith effort to learn from common mistakes. reply PaulDavisThe1st 14 hours agorootparentThank you for your service. reply andrewflnr 12 hours agorootparentService? Thank me when it's published and the real life feedback comes in. Maybe. :D reply keiferski 15 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think the author is the relevant person here. The filmmakers are, and they pretty clearly chose to make Durden a charismatic figure and Jack an awkward one. And of course they would - it makes for a better story and overall film. Beyond that, I think most films/shows are functionally the same. No one wants to watch an ugly, uncharismatic actor just…fail. That doesn’t make for a good story. It seems pretty obvious to me that the vast majority shows are produced based on the quality of the story, not on instilling ethical values. Otherwise why would something like Dexter even exist? reply PaulDavisThe1st 14 hours agorootparentDurden is, according the author at least, an imaginary character. In his mind at least that overrides the \"charisma\" level. So make of that what you will.

Negativity? reply chmod600 14 hours agorootparentNot an expert, but it seems to me that sarcasm is a kind of universal negativity that can be applied to pretty much anything. It's also incredibly vague and ambiguous about whether anything better exists or could exist. For instance, looking at American news, you could sarcastically say \"Go America!\" to almost any story (unless it's actually good news, of course). Not only is such sarcasm negative, but it's also very passive. Sarcasm also strikes me as juvenile. Children complain because they expect a parent will find a solution for them. Juveniles turn to sarcasm because they don't want to ask an adult to solve it, but they don't have a solution either. Then when they grow up, they realize that problems really do need to be solved and no one else will do it, so they need to use more productive communication strategies. reply borski 16 hours agorootparentprevOverusing sarcasm is a method of expressing displeasure or discontent without actively pushing away those around you. You’re not actively insulting them, you’re “just joking,” but simultaneously expressing negative feelings. As a pointed remark, it can be hellishly funny.

It puts the burden on the listener and requires mind reading - \"is she being serious? Or is this a joke?\".

However, I never felt such strong association with comedians until after both of my parents passed in difficult fashions. I felt such a strong need to be funny, like it was my only good personality trait. I eventually took a standup class. I enjoyed getting on stage and working up to my 5 min set. I still write jokes and go to open mics every now and then. The two takeaways I have are: * the practice of writing everyday was key. Having to articulate what was actually upsetting me—instead of just saying \"I hate this or that\"—to find what was funny or absurd about it really helped me release a lot of the pent up anger. * like the quote, making other people laugh was/is so rewarding both for my own self-esteem and for knowing that I brought a little joy to others reply dang 14 hours agoprevUrl changed from https://www.iflscience.com/sad-clown-paradox-why-you-should-..., which points to this. reply AlbertCory 16 hours agoprev\"Clowns are unhappy\" is just something people with no sense of humor say to feel better about themselves. Everyone is unhappy about something. I'd rather see it channeled into humor than into passive-aggressiveness. People mention Robin Williams and John Belushi. If you want a (fictional) example, take Jerry (or Larry?) from Parks and Rec. He was as boringly positive as anyone alive, but he had a fantastic family life, and more importantly, I'd bet his kids would say, \"Dad is really funny!\" And most of his \"jokes\" would be silly Dad jokes. reply borski 16 hours agoparentYou can have no sense of humor and still be miserable. Humor absolutely is a defense mechanism for people who are sad and depressed; I know because I have anxiety and depression and am funny, and I know why. But that doesn’t mean everyone funny is miserable. reply AlbertCory 15 hours agorootparentWe have a set inclusion problem here. (People who are miserable) does not properly contain (people who are funny). They overlap. So we agree. reply borski 14 hours agorootparentYes, but the percentage of funny people skews heavily toward those who are miserable.

My dad was a funny guy, his whole family was funny except his eldest brother who only has darkness. He wasn't as abusive as his dad; we never got the shit kicked out of us, but I grew up dealing with some dad-derived-darkness. I was always class clown, I continually crack jokes, people keep complaining that HN doesn't do humor but jeez, folks, 90% of my karma here comes from pithy observational humor. (truth: HN hates low-hanging fruit of all varieties, and comedians who complain about their audience suck*) This is something I've been thinking about recently in job-hunting. NASA [1] has looked at clowns to evaluate their utility in teambuilding -- and no surprise to me, a joker** finds their place in high-stress environments. Makes sense to me, because I've lived this dynamic and my release valve being stuck open has been an incredible social lubricant in my life. Most people don't know how to let go a little bit: they tend to hold it all in until the dam bursts. I don't think I'd have survived my childhood with that approach. Jokers like me enter a stressful situation, and knock the edge off a little, because this is our natural defense to pre-trauma. In a professional environment, members of our audience are often unaware of the process underway -- jokers hold an umbrella against an unseen rain. But people think they hate comedy! Jokers are seen as unserious, unreliable; add to that this stupid stereotype that women can't be funny -- I can't put this on my resume, despite it being literally my most useful social skill. Yeah, I can knuckle down and write code and fix bugs like anybody else, but what I can do for social cohesion doesn't get measured. I've even defrayed situations between my manager and my skip with a light comment. I'm reluctant to crack jokes in an interview because of humor's negative perception, but in truth that means I only let the good ones slip out. But what happens after an interview where I have not found a single opportunity for levity? Do I want to work for a manager who I don't feel comfortable making a joke around? [1] https://roundupreads.jsc.nasa.gov/roundup/1154 * and yes I do mean latter-day Seinfeld ** I do prefer the term joker to clown.

Unfortunately, when it comes to moderation it comes downtown to house rules and who is \"ruling\" the house.

I dated a girl back in college who was the most miserable and unhappy person I ever met. But, she would project this niceness and happiness to everyone (She didn't have lots of friends and was always very quiet. Also VERY passive aggressive and judgmental and was deathly afraid of what others thought of her). She also didn't seem to think any of this was a problem. It ended up being very toxic for our relationship and I had a clean break and haven't talked to her for almost a decade. I checked up on her recently and she now has a podcast related to happiness and how you can be as happiness as her. I seriously doubt she's changed. It's just more projection to the world that she's a happy person. reply ZeroGravitas 19 hours agoparentThere was the Scott Alexander thing recently (in the context of defending polyamory) talking about how if you want information on how to walk, then you'd probably be better talking to the person who has some debilitating physical issue as they've been motivated to think about it long and hard, and find all sorts of tricks and techniques to make it easier, while most people have never even thought about walking. And that many \"experts\" will fit this model. I don't think he said a follow up thought I just had, which is that the kind of person who goes looking for walking or happiness podcasts is very likely not in the \"just comes naturally demographic\" either. reply billy99k 18 hours agorootparentThis is good for people that learned how to overcome their issues. However, in my case, I think she is still unhappy, but is so afraid of what others might think of her (she also now has a career), that she has to broadcast to the world that she's happy.

That's for her to figure out. No one owes miserable people a chance. I'm not sure why you're suggesting lying is acceptable just so she can date. Weird opinion. reply funnym0nk3y 15 hours agorootparentAnd when to stop working on yourself and start dating? Which metric to fulfill? Unfortunately there are people that are predisposed to certain difficult personality traits. Personality heritability is about 50%. So working on it is a limited affair. Nobody is perfect, and dating is about finding someone who is comfortable with your imperfections and your with theirs. Nobody owes me anything more than basic human rights and dignity. And what I expect I try to give to others. reply hotpotamus 16 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps we could call it putting your best self forward to make a good first impression? The advice I've often seen is to treat a date like a job interview - is full honesty expected there? In fact, in a romantic context, is full honesty ever appropriate? If you said something like, we're probably both around 7 on the attractiveness scale, make similar incomes, aren't getting any younger, and probably can't do much better; let's settle for each other - how would that sort of honesty play? reply bongodongobob 16 hours agorootparentI don't think treating dating like a job interview is a good idea unless you are interviewing them. You can either put your personality out there and be rejected or you can fake it, and then when you do out your actual self out there get rejected later down the road. The choice is yours! reply borski 16 hours agorootparentI agreed with your first comment, but this isn’t quite fair. People put their best foot forward not because they are lying or pretending their negative qualities don’t exist, but because showing the positive ones can often lead someone to overlook and accept the negative ones, whereas leading with the negative rarely works the other way around. You dress up for interviews, more than you would to go get a coffee, and likely more than an average day at the office. Is that lying? People also dress up for dates. They wear makeup and nice shoes. They’re not liars; they’re dating. reply funnym0nk3y 15 hours agorootparentI always wondered (and still do) what people feel when they dress up to date. I've always thought of it as hiding my true personality. Showing someone different. Playing a role. Does everyone feel like that? reply borski 15 hours agorootparentNope. I don’t spend every day walking around in my best threads. But I do spend some time doing it, and it feels special and important, and it shows I respect the occasion and the other party enough to put in the work. Moreover, it shows that I’m willing to put in the work for something I might care about. None of those are lies. And all of that makes an impression before anyone has said a word. reply hotpotamus 12 hours agorootparentprevI'll note that both your options there end in rejection. reply justinlloyd 17 hours agoprevI have always used humour, proper humour, not sarcasm, in a variety of ways. Find the dark humour in a dark situation. Make a wise ass remark during a stressful situation. Sometimes the humour is inappropriately placed; inappropriately placed but still funny. \"I had an absolute shit Christmas - I got laid off, my dad died, and someone gave me white sport socks. Seriously!? Who the hell gives white sport socks as a gift?\" Humour is my armour. Sometimes my clowning is seen as unprofessional by \"serious business people\" but I honestly don't care to work with those kinds of people anyway. I use humour to start conversations with people. I make my wife laugh every single day. \"What's up?\" I asked as I walked in the bedroom. \"I'm burning up\" replies my wife on a cold January evening. \"She's burning up. She wants the world to know. She's so hot she'll glow. She's burning up. She wants to know the cause! Maybe it's early on-set meno-pause! 'coz she's burning up!\" I'm an introvert. \"Hah!\" exclaims someone at the back of the room. No. Really. I'm an introvert. I know all the names of the people at Trader Joe's on Sunset. I know the names of the people at the Starbucks opposite. I know the names of many of the regulars. Many of the people that work the stores around the area too. The people at the post office. Our regular UPS and Fedex drivers stop to chat. I can tell you about their kids, their jobs, their life. They know me too, or many of them do. I talk to them all. Ask questions about their day. What you see in-person in front of you at the office, at the restaurant, making sure everyone is included, talking to anybody I run into, working a room at a networking group, that's not me. I put on my Oxford shirt. I put on my black cashmere jacket. I pick up my electronic business cards. That's my sword and my shield. I step into battle. Face the world. Talk with everyone. Make sure they aren't left out. Approach everyone. Show interest. Ask questions. When people come together in a social setting, I'm usually that single connection between a lot of disparate people. At a networking meeting where I know nobody to start I will know dozens by the end of the night, \"Hey Dave, great to make your acquaintance! Have you met Jeff? Let me introduce you, he's this awesome software developer out of Facebook. You guys should talk.\" A minute ago I didn't know Dave. Fifteen minutes ago I didn't know Jeff. People want to talk about themselves. And nobody knows how to break into the conversation. I'm that catalyst. Their ice breaker. \"Here, let me find Mike in this crowd, he knows Android stuff, he can answer your questions.\" I know Android stuff too, but let's introduce two new people to each other, this isn't about me. I go home and I close the door and I sigh a sigh of relief that it is over and I can just be alone and recharge. I studied improv and comedy for a few years, had a small side career in it too for a while, even appeared in a few Hollywood clubs, which sounds more impressive than it really is. Robin Williams and Steve Martin were teenage heroes of mine. I wanted to be like that. That non-stop onslaught of stream of conscious pinballing from one comedic observation to another. The art of improv isn’t that it is all done right there, but that its rehearsed, and rather than an entire show, a six course dinner served at a fine restaurant like many comedy routines, improv is a Chinese buffet where you are elbowing the last words from your mouth out of the way to get at the next crunchy morsel your ADD brain just leapt too. There is a scene, where Pam Dawber played by Sarah Murphree in the test footage for a biopic tells Robin Williams, played by Jamie Costa, \"Shut up for a minute, I'm being serious.\" When I watched that footage with my wife, she looked at me and said \"That's you.\" And I had to apologize to her for having to live with that. Years ago, when I first met my wife, I said \"one day, you'll tell me to shut up. It'll happen.\" \"Oh, that'll never happen\" said she. \"She wants the world to know, that she's burning up!\" \"Shut up for a minute would you? I'm being serious!\" she said. Do I suffer from anxiety and depression? No, actually, I enjoy it. Who wouldn't? All those awesome memories flooding back to you in vivid detail at 4AM in the morning. Pain takes away your humanity. Comedy brings it back. When people ask me how I'm doing I deadpan that I am living the American dream, but really, deep down, I'm fine, I'm just a little tired that's all. reply imperialdrive 16 hours agoparentI like your style, amigo. reply amelius 20 hours agoprev [–] Perhaps especially if they use \"/s\" often? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
