I have tried to\u00a0write only facts, although there is a\u00a0small hurricane somewhere inside me right now.It began nearly a\u00a0year ago, in\u00a0April of\u00a02022, when I applied for\u00a0multiple SWE and\u00a0SRE positions at\u00a0Google. Large tech companies usually have a\u00a0lengthy hiring process, but\u00a0I could take it slow. I successfully completed five technical interviews during May and\u00a0June. However, shortly after that, the\u00a0company encountered some difficulties due to\u00a0the\u00a0global post-COVID crisis, and\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0result, HR were unavailable for\u00a0weeks. I had to\u00a0be patient.In\u00a0July, I entered the\u00a0Team Matching Phase where I had the\u00a0opportunity to\u00a0meet with hiring managers. During these meetings, we talked about ourselves, the\u00a0team, and\u00a0the\u00a0project, and\u00a0ultimately decided whether or\u00a0not\u00a0we were a\u00a0good fit for\u00a0each other. After attending two meetings, I realised that I wasn\u2019t interested in\u00a0joining either team at\u00a0the\u00a0moment.Regrettably, I had to\u00a0wait a\u00a0considerable amount of\u00a0time for\u00a0the\u00a0next opportunity. Google had announced an\u00a0international hiring freeze, which essentially halted all interview and\u00a0job offer processes. The\u00a0exact extent of\u00a0the\u00a0freeze and\u00a0the\u00a0regions it affected is unclear, with contradictory information available online. Nevertheless, the\u00a0freeze did affect me: I was assigned to\u00a0a\u00a0different HR manager who informed me that \u201cUnfortunately we are not\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0position to\u00a0move forward with your application at\u00a0this time due to\u00a0a\u00a0current slowdown in\u00a0hiring at\u00a0Google. Our leaders are taking the\u00a0next few weeks to\u00a0review our priorities for\u00a0the\u00a0rest of\u00a0the\u00a0year and\u00a0we hope to\u00a0have an\u00a0update for\u00a0you at\u00a0the\u00a0beginning of\u00a0August.\u201dAt\u00a0the\u00a0beginning of\u00a0August, things didn\u2019t change a\u00a0lot (\u201cUnfortunately we still have a\u00a0pause on hiring and\u00a0I\u2019m afraid that there have been no\u00a0further updates from the\u00a0business side at\u00a0this point in\u00a0time.\u201d), and\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0end of\u00a0the\u00a0month either (\u201cUnfortunately we still haven\u2019t had any news, I\u2019m really sorry that it\u2019s taking longer than initially expected\u201d). It wasn\u2019t until the\u00a0end of\u00a0September that the\u00a0situation shifted. I received news that my candidacy could be submitted to\u00a0the\u00a0Hiring Committee before completing the\u00a0team matching phase. Nearly six months after submitting my application, I was thrilled to\u00a0learn on October 11th that the\u00a0Hiring Committee had approved me. The\u00a0next step was to\u00a0find a\u00a0team that was willing to\u00a0bring me on board. Fortunately, a\u00a0suitable team was found in\u00a0November. I had a\u00a0conversation with Tom, the\u00a0hiring manager, and\u00a0we hit it off. From there, the\u00a0process moved forward smoothly.On November 17, my salary was announced and\u00a0in\u00a0December, I received an\u00a0official offer for\u00a0a\u00a0SRE position at\u00a0Google London. I began preparing for\u00a0my move by\u00a0taking an\u00a0English exam and\u00a0a\u00a0mandatory tuberculosis test for\u00a0Russians working in\u00a0the\u00a0UK. After the\u00a0long New Year holidays, I applied to\u00a0the\u00a0visa application center, which took nearly two months to\u00a0issue the\u00a0visa. In\u00a0March, I quit my previous company, Yandex, to\u00a0spend the\u00a0last month preparing for\u00a0my move to\u00a0London, which involved vacating my apartment in\u00a0Yekaterinburg, packing my belongings, and\u00a0selling some items.I had planned to\u00a0fly out on April 10, giving myself a\u00a0week to\u00a0acclimate and\u00a0get comfortable before starting work on April 17. However, on the\u00a0evening of\u00a0April 6, I received an\u00a0unexpected email from Liz West, the\u00a0head of\u00a0Google Cloud HR in\u00a0Europe, asking to\u00a0connect with me regarding \u201can\u00a0update on my Google offer\u201d. I chose to\u00a0connect the\u00a0following day.During the\u00a0call, Liz West informed me that my contract with Google had been terminated due to\u00a0a\u00a0wave of\u00a0layoffs that began in\u00a0the\u00a0United States and\u00a0now reached Europe and\u00a0Britain. \u201cUnfortunately\u201d, my position had come under reduction, so I no\u00a0longer had the\u00a0job I had been working towards for\u00a0the\u00a0past year. Nothing personal, just business.This is the\u00a0official notification that I received after the\u00a0conversation:Thus, the\u00a0contract with me has been terminated 10 days before it was supposed to\u00a0take effect.As\u00a0for\u00a0what to\u00a0do next, I am not\u00a0entirely sure yet. I held a\u00a0\u201cgarage sale\u201d (in\u00a0Russian) and\u00a0sold most of\u00a0my belongings. The\u00a0remaining items were either discarded, recycled, or\u00a0packed into two suitcases that I had planned to\u00a0take with me. Moving to\u00a0a\u00a0new country is a\u00a0difficult task that typically requires months of\u00a0preparation. Changing these plans on the\u00a0fly is challenging and\u00a0somewhat painful. However, I feel that I should say something optimistic at\u00a0the\u00a0end. All will be good \ud83d\ude42If you would like to\u00a0speak with me, please send an\u00a0email to\u00a0andgein@gmail.com, or\u00a0message me on Telegram @andgein.

    "hn_content": "A story of a person who worked briefly for Google has sparked discussion on Hacker News, with some commenters sharing stories of similar experiences with other companies. Some advise against putting in notice until all paperwork is completed, while others recommend pushing back start dates if necessary. Some commenters discuss controversial policies on quitting at other companies, such as immediate termination, while others share experiences with vacation policies during notice periods. Although the thread covers a variety of topics, the main point of discussion is the risks and pitfalls of quitting a job and accepting a new offer.The comments on this post, which is likely to attract tech experts, involve a discussion regarding the ethics of companies that pay employees for two weeks after the notice period has ended. Some users argue that it's better for the business to pay these weeks to minimize risk and avoid unemployment premiums, while others suggest it's reasonable for businesses to immediately terminate employment after employees give their notices. One user notes that some smaller companies, particularly after rapid growth, may struggle with employees leaving and are awkward about things ending. While there are exceptions, in most professional US-based jobs, employee termination comes with severance pay or notice. European countries often require payout for the notice period, and the length also varies depending on the employee's length of service.HN users discuss their experiences with background checks and drug screens during the hiring process, with some noting that they have worked for companies that only conducted screenings after employment. The topic of giving notice when transitioning jobs is also discussed, with some users advocating for waiting until the first day with the new company to give notice, while others note that this can be difficult or impossible with relocation involved. Some users also explain employment notice periods and employment rights in different countries.A Hacker News thread discussed the ethics of working a new job while still collecting a paycheck from an old employer, which some commenters found unethical and risky, as it could lead to legal trouble. Some people have found ways to manage this situation, such as giving two weeks notice and waiting for a written job offer. However, others warned that violating employee policies could result in termination or legal action, and advised caution. Some commenters also expressed frustration with HR practices and wondered if AI could improve the hiring process, while others pointed out potential drawbacks and errors that could come with automated recruiting.An article on Hacker News recounts a hiring mistake that led to an offer being rescinded, with users sharing their own experiences about similar incidents. Suggestions for better hiring processes include using AI or \"one-click-apply\" systems. Some users point out the possibility of at-will employment and managerial objections that could cause last-minute changes. Others share their own clauses for relocation expenses or redundancy protections in employee agreements. Commenters advise against quitting a job before passing probation at a new employer, while some express disbelief at companies taking such risks with potential employees.Employees should consider asking for relocation protection in their job contracts, though it may not always be possible. One solution seen in larger companies is to have a relocation bonus paid on the start date. However, this does not account for situations where the employee is laid off before their start date. Relocation protection clauses are common and companies may have prepared clauses that they can add upon request or negotiation. However, not all companies will allow employees to add clauses to their contracts. Candidates may also hedge their bets by not giving notice until one to two weeks into their new job.HN users share their negative experiences with Google and Apple's hiring processes, including rescinded offers and personal attacks from hiring managers. However, one individual shares positive experience and recommends prioritizing oneself when disrespected by an employer. Discussion also includes the challenges of preventing unfair disadvantage for candidates while maintaining hiring standards and preventing wasted preparation. Some comments suggest that public tech companies prioritize stock price instead of employee satisfaction or customer satisfaction, while others argue for the need for cost-cutting measures due to flat revenue growth.A discussion on the rescinding of job offers by tech companies has taken place on Hacker News, with some suggesting that binding job offers with compensation requirements would be a good solution. Others suggest the hiring of additional staff would increase employment risk factors and potentially lead to additional rounds of interviews; the burden would be amplified in struggling economies. One user suggests companies should be held accountable for actual costs incurred by rescinding offers, including replacement of discarded items and moving costs. The main point stressed is that the human cost of decisions should not be forgotten, and companies should be more strategic in their hiring practices.Google is facing criticism after a job offer was rescinded one week before the employee was due to start. While the company offered to pay the employee for two months to make up for relocation costs, many have called for clear laws to be imposed in such cases. One commenter suggested \u201cany offer revoked before the agreed start date implies mandatory payment of six months of salary, automatically, without exception\u201d, while others proposed a severance payment, should termination occur pre-employment agreement. Meanwhile, one expert suggested that the problem centres on companies hiring people whom they do not need in pursuit of growth, while another proposed automating the hiring and firing processes in full.An HN user suggests that moving to another country for a job may be worth the risk if a company cannot compensate a person appropriately; they suggest using resources to hedge against serious downside if things do not go as planned. This is seen as more sensible and realistic advice compared to relying on laws for protection. However, another user notes that laws are meant to protect those who may not have the resources to proactively protect themselves. The importance of having a buffer of savings is mentioned, but this is dismissed as being applicable only to those with financial stability. Overall, the thread discusses the risks and strategies involved in making a big move for a job, including the difficulties of navigating legal systems in another country.",

    "hn_content": "Substack Notes have launched, leading to speculation about whether it will compete with Twitter's product. Some users see this as an opportunity for Substack to compete with Twitter, while others believe Twitter is not dying. Thought leaders in various fields are still active on Twitter, but many are double posting on both Twitter and Mastodon. The tech landscape is changing, and Google's AI, Twitter, and Facebook all face challenges. Users have discussed similarities between Kodak's failed transition toward digital cameras and Google's unwillingness to adjust to change. Some users are wishing for Twitter's failure due to ongoing dissatisfaction with the platform, while others believe that too much focus on Twitter is unrealistic.Users on Hacker News discuss their preferences for search engines, with some noting issues with DuckDuckGo and Google while recommending Kagi as a viable alternative. Other comments touch on the usability of Edge, the annoyance of Bing chat, and the potential downfall of Google's search dominance. There is mention of AI-assisted search as a possible disruptor, while some users express skepticism about the longevity of Google's market power.Legacy companies like Microsoft and IBM have missed the boat on new technology arrivals despite having profitable businesses, and current tech giants like Twitter may soon face disruption as they become ossified and slow. Facebook's business remains robust despite its missteps, and its Messenger service has replaced services like Skype for many people. Discord is gaining popularity over Twitter in certain circles, while Elon Musk has been accused of using the term \"free speech\" in bad faith when criticizing Twitter. Mastodon's potential to grow may be limited due to UI stumbling blocks and poor discoverability. The question of whether Twitter can be replicated is a moot point as the conditions under which it initially flourished no longer exist.The enduring popularity of Twitter is due to its variety of voices, though financial sustainability remains uncertain. Facebook's group features are well-liked, but many dislike the platform itself. Mastodon offers a less addictive alternative to Twitter's constant outrage culture. Twitter power-users are increasingly shifting to Mastodon, but discoverability is harder. Twitter's technical issues and advertising overload have caused high-quality accounts to interact less. Musk's attitude towards hate speech and refusal to address systemic injustices aligns him with a racist, sexist, and transphobic faction of society. The Verfication system was a key feature of Twitter that attracted high-profile users, but killing it has driven out the blue checks who generated substantial traffic for the site.The article discusses the tension between anti-\"woke\" politics and systemic injustices in American society. Some comments focus on Twitter and its recent changes due to Elon Musk's involvement. While some users have left Twitter, others have found it more authentic and less manipulative. Users have also debated Musk's political views and their impact on the platform. An HN user points out a definition of \"woke\" as \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.\" However, there is some debate over whether this is an accurate definition. Despite controversies, Twitter continues to be a significant social media platform.Comments on HN regarding Twitter's new subscription service, Twitter Blue, include complaints about continued ad exposure despite paying for the service, differing opinions on the value of additional verification markers for businesses, and speculation regarding Twitter's future business model given recent struggles with profitability. One commenter criticized Elon Musk's management of Twitter while others debated the wisdom of his purchase of the site, while still others discussed possible reasons for Substack's recent growth and fundraising efforts. Despite differing opinions, many comments express concern over monetizing social media and the potential impact on user experience.Crowdsourcing fundraising is becoming a new way for startups to avoid the \"down round\" game with VCs. This is because once a company enters this game, they are stuck in it, \"having to keep fundraising to keep fueling the growth.\" Early stage VCs these days, unlike before, don't pressure founders for quick growth. A way to pivot to a new advertising based business model is by introducing features that encourage more engagement like Substack's new \"notes\" feature. Twitter has been completely worthless for promoting Substack channels, with word of mouth and SEO proving to be more effective. Different social media sites like Reddit and StackExchange are now censoring and making it difficult for self-promotion. Mastodon is better, but slow.Many high profile individuals, such as Neil Gaiman, created Mastodon accounts, suggesting a potential alternative to Twitter. However, there is no conclusive evidence of a \"mass exodus\" from Twitter, and it is suggested that the hype created by the news was overstated. There is a growing number of accounts syndicating to Mastodon, but it remains a small fraction of Twitter's user base. Meanwhile, Substack has added a \"Notes\" feature that allows users to post shorter content, potentially turning it into a Twitter-like platform. However, it remains to be seen if this move will attract users or potentially cannibalize Substack's own audience for long-form content.An HN user points out that there is an option to subscribe to notes without newsletters on desktop via Substack's three-dot menu. However, the UX is suboptimal. The post mentions that applications for YC Summer 2023 are open, with relevant links provided.",
    "hn_summary": "Substack has launched a new \"Notes\" feature, leading to discussions about whether it will compete with Twitter. Users have expressed varying opinions over Twitter's continued importance and the rise of Mastodon as an alternative. Crowdsourcing fundraising and new features, such as Substack's Notes, have become ways for startups to pivot to new business models. Monetizing social media, through methods such as Twitter's new subscription service \"Twitter Blue,\" has raised concerns for some users. Additionally, Substack's Notes feature may cannibalize its own long-form content audience."

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeFrom my perspective, it comes down to five main things:Stronger web specificationsFocus on vertical slicesDeferring on performance workTeam cultureHaving an experienced leaderStronger web specificationsWe\u2019ve come a long way from the wishy-washy days of HTML4 and CSS2.1.The ECMAScript, HTML, and CSS specifications today are (for the most part) stellar technical documents whose algorithms can be implemented with considerably less effort and guesswork than in the past.The architecture of Ladybird tries really hard to match the architecture described in the various web specifications. This makes it significantly easier for new developers to get oriented, as they only have to learn one architecture instead of two.There are still gaps though, and some features are less specified than others. Thankfully there\u2019s an active community of editors at the W3C working on improvements. A fair amount of the work we do on Ladybird involves adapting our codebase to updates made by these spec editors.We try to do our part in improving the specs as well: the Ladybird developers often report spec bugs, and sometimes make PRs to improve specs directly. Not to mention that implementing a spec in a novel browser engine provides great validation that the spec is actually complete.Focus on vertical slicesWhile the specs today are indeed better than ever before, it\u2019s still the case that many features span multiple specs, often with subtle interactions between subsystems that must be understood by an implementer.If you tried to build a browser one spec at a time, or even one feature at a time, you\u2019d most likely run out of steam and lose interest altogether. So instead of that, we tend to focus on building \u201cvertical slices\u201d of functionality. This means setting practical, cross-cutting goals, such as \u201clet\u2019s get twitter.com/awesomekling to load\u201d, \u201clet\u2019s get login working on discord.com\u201d, and other similar objectives.Working on a vertical slice helps maintain momentum and it's highly motivating to see tangible improvement on real live websites as they progress.This approach is in part possible because the web itself is designed around graceful degradation, meaning that browsers can render web content while only supporting some of the features used by the site.You might think this approach would produce a small collection of \u201ccompatible websites\u201d and a vast desert of non-working things, but what really happens is that the rising tide lifts all boats, and as we focus on improving one website, thousands of other sites improve as well!Deferring on performance workWe're currently not putting much effort into optimizing Ladybird for performance. Instead, our primary focus is on addressing issues related to correctness and compatibility. This approach helps us stay focused on making sure the browser works as intended before diving into optimizations.It's not that we don't care about performance. We want our browser to be fast and responsive eventually. It's a matter of making a disciplined choice to not spend too much time optimizing a product that doesn't work correctly yet. For example, while we might identify areas where we could potentially optimize JavaScript execution or rendering speed, we consciously choose to prioritize fixing rendering bugs or compatibility issues with popular websites first.We do make exceptions for things that are unbearably slow. We don't want working on the browser to be unpleasant, after all. In such cases, we'll invest time in addressing the most significant performance bottlenecks to maintain a tolerable development experience.But we're not tracking benchmark scores and things like that at this stage. That day will come though, once we've achieved a solid foundation in terms of correctness and compatibility!Team cultureIn the time we\u2019ve spent together working on this, a strong team culture has formed. The culture is highly optimistic and everyone has a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude.Although the team is distributed around the world, we all meet on Discord to chat and spur each other on. People frequently collaborate and pitch in on each other\u2019s projects.Everyone who works on Ladybird is encouraged to explore their own personal interests within the project. Most folks on the team had never looked at browser code before joining us, and they're quickly becoming world-class browser developers.Also, since Ladybird is an offshoot from the SerenityOS project, it shares the same culture of accountability and self-reliance. We avoid 3rd party dependencies and build everything ourselves. In part because it\u2019s fun, but also because it creates total accountability for what goes into our software.Having an experienced leaderAn experienced leader can make a significant difference in a project like this. I've had the opportunity to work on production browsers for many years (at Apple and Nokia), which has given me a strong understanding of how browsers are put together.While other people may look at the huge stack of technologies and specifications that need to be combined to make a browser and feel overwhelmed, I\u2019ve got a clear picture of how to put them together and make it work. We save a lot of time here by not worrying about whether it\u2019s possible and just getting straight to the work instead!In more practical terms, what I really end up working on is often between the seams \u2014 parts of the browser that are less rigidly specified (e.g layout & rendering). Those parts can be much harder for less experienced browser developers to engage with.ConclusionAlthough I don\u2019t believe our exact way of working is directly transferable to other software projects (unless they are also browsers), with a small team of smart, focused individuals and a knowledgeable leader to guide them, you can build any software you want.Thanks for reading Andreas Kling!

    "hn_content": "A team has taken on the impossible task of building a web browser using a unique development strategy that focuses on creating \u201cvertical slices\u201d of functionality, rather than building based on features or specifications. They target cross-cutting goals, such as getting specific websites to load, as a way to prioritize development. This approach has comparisons with the Wine emulator and console emulators, which work to solve issues one game (or program) at a time, instead of implementing a list of API functions to fix. The challenge with this approach on the web, compared to Wine, is that even after you get a website functioning well, a minor redesign can cause everything to again stop working as expected.A post on Hacker News discusses a vertical slice approach to creating a new browser, which involves implementing only the essential features necessary for practical use cases instead of the entire API. Some comments question the approach and its efficacy, while others mention similar methods used in game development. There is debate over the accuracy of the article's claim regarding the number of specs from the W3C, and the discussion delves into the challenges of navigating a large volume of information to implement a system.An HN user points out that the length of specs is not necessarily an indication of technical intractability of implementation. The value of verbosity in a standard depends on whether it defines well-defined behavior or leaves gaps of undefined behavior. The length of an HTML-based standard including its reference standards may be non-trivial, but this is not necessarily an issue for implementing a modern web browser. WebGL may not be a significant part of current standards, and may not be necessary for implementing a functional and modern web browser. The HTML, ECMAScript, and CSS specifications are fully spelled out and largely mechanical, making it easier to implement;the HTML parsing algorithm is a good example of this.The complexity of creating a new browser lies in the rendering engine, with most frameworks being quite similar. However, the current HTML and CSS specs, while exhaustive, do not necessarily reflect actual implementation. The difficulty lies in the interactions between different parts of the code, as seen, for instance, in the complexities created by position: sticky in CSS, which results in issues with flexboxes, z-index, and negative margins. Even Servo, Mozilla's project to create a new rendering engine, had its challenges because of its under-documented components. Creating a new state-of-the-art browser to rival Chrome, Firefox or Safari may take more than a decade, given the complexity of their rendering engines.SerenityOS has built a browser using C++ and Qt, and HN users discuss various aspects such as the choice of programming language, the selection of GUI framework, the possibility of embedding the browser, and the license of the project. Some comments also mention the use of a memory-safe language being developed for SerenityOS. While the project is seen as interesting due to its use of C++ and Qt, some express concern over the use of an unsafe language for a web browser. There is also discussion of the need for a C API version of the browser for embedding purposes. Finally, HN users note that this project represents a new browser engine being developed from scratch, rather than simply rebranding an existing one.Building a web browser engine is challenging due to the numerous specifications, multiple versions of each specification, and the need to support broken websites, in addition to the graphical output being harder to unit test. However, some volunteer C++ projects have done excellent memory management, and bypassed memory management issues by using modern C++ features and error return types instead of null. Ada and some lesser-used languages have well-supported formal verification methods to reduce crashes, but few mainstream languages do. While the specs have improved, there's still a lot of invalid HTML on the web, and building a web browser is an ambitious project.Building a browser engine is incredibly difficult due to ever-shifting web standards and browser requirements. Features such as CSS, HTML, and JS are constantly changing, making it difficult to keep up. While building a new JS engine from scratch may be feasible, implementing it into a fully functioning browser is a much larger undertaking. Implementing specs to the pixel level can cause issues when pixels shift from version to version requiring golden data to be rebased. The most important thing is to understand the challenge of building a new browser engine is less about features and more about performance.Ladybird, an open-source browser engine, is being developed with a focus on vertical slices for now, deferring performance work. Building a new browser engine is not unlike creating an OS or compiler, and despite many competitors having their own browsers, many people are discouraged from building a web browser engine. Navigating \"long tail\" web compatibility issues and making complex projects more accessible could be achieved by librifying web browser engines. Andreas Kling, the leader of Ladybird's team, worked at Apple and Nokia, where he worked on browser engine performance, and implementing the W3C specs is Ladybird's primary goal. One potential use case of Ladybird is as a contenteditable polyfill.An HN user noted that Google Docs now uses canvas to render everything. Another HN user suggested that creating a graphical word processor with web technology is infeasible compared to creating a desktop app with its GUI toolkit. The debate on creating apps on a browser continued with some suggesting it's a terrible application platform, while others argue that it is one of the best application platforms for both users and developers due to its wide reach. Additionally, a user shared their excitement for Language Models and the possibility of creating new products. Lastly, building a browser is attainable, but the real challenge lies in creating a better one with a more sophisticated UX.",

The change took half a day to implement + test, and had a net delta of -580 LOC. Much more importantly, it drastically improved the reliability and resiliency of our system. This is a writeup of that change, the rationale behind it, and how we did it.Note: this is not an indictment against RabbitMQ or other queuing systems. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite possible (likely, really) that we were holding it wrong. If anything, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a push to keep things simple. And, of course, a very biased reminder that SQL is unbelievably powerful. In fact, it often really is all you need. Do we dream of a world where everything is SQL? Maybe.Some useful contextLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk briefly about why we needed a queue in the first place. Prequel is a large-scale data pipeline: we help B2B SaaS companies sync data to or from their customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database. In other words, our business consists of running data transfers between various dbs and warehouses. Each of these transfers can be modeled as a job, which is put into a queue and processed by workers. One idiosyncrasy of these jobs is that they can be fairly long to process: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unheard of for a data backfill to take several hours, and the fastest jobs take at least a few seconds. To make all of this run smoothly, we enqueue and dequeue thousands of jobs every day.\u00e2\u0080\u008dRabbitMQ: good enough to startWhen we initially designed our system, we settled on RabbitMQ as the right queuing solution for the job. It was widely adopted, based on an even more widely adopted protocol (AMQP), seemed mature and production-grade, and looked easy enough to add to our Helm chart. We wrote our own GoLang wrapper around an existing client, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about it twice, and shipped it.Our setup was fairly straightforward. We configured it such that any message could only be processed by one consumer: this allowed us to avoid having different workers running the same transfer, which would be a waste of everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compute. We also set it up such that consumers would \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanually\u00e2\u0080\u009d ACK messages. We tried to keep everything as lightweight as possible, and it worked well for us for a while.\u00e2\u0080\u008dIssues started popping upWe started experiencing issues and challenges a few months in. We spent a lot of time tweaking our consumer reconnection behavior, aka what happens if somehow one of the workers loses its connection to the queue. We had a handful of multi-threading bugs where a consumer timing out from the queue would cause it to reconnect twice, effectively growing the number of queue threads exponentially. This led to some fun memory utilization graphs. We dealt with those and moved on.Until one fateful evening, when we got paged by a customer. They were seeing some of their transfers arbitrarily delayed by up to a few hours, sometimes so much so that our system would mark them as stale and cancel them. There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any good explanation for this: our queue wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t showing any major backlogs, our workers looked healthy, and the majority of jobs were being processed just fine. Except for those occasional, seemingly non-deterministic stragglers. Of course, that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make for a very satisfying answer for our customers: \u00e2\u0080\u009csorry, we know a handful of your transfers are delayed by a matter of hours, but our system looks healthy so \u00c2\u00af\\_(\u00e3\u0083\u0084)_/\u00c2\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u009d.After _hours_ of investigating and a bunch of banging our heads against our desks, we managed to root-cause the issue. Turns out each RabbitMQ consumer was prefetching the next message (job) when it picked up the current one. This prevented other consumers from acking the message, and thus from picking it up from the queue. See RabbitMQ documentation on this here.Now, this is fine when most jobs take a roughly even and well-bounded amount of time. Where things get dicey is when some jobs can take hours (remember, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about data transfers here). What was happening in our case was: a worker would pick up a message, and prefetch the next one. It would process the current message, a multi-hour transfer, and hold the next one effectively hostage until it had completed the one it was chewing on.Even worse, there was no way (that we could find) to disable the behavior. You could set the prefetch count to 1, which meant every worker will prefetch at most 1 message. Or you could set it to 0, which meant they will each prefetch an infinite number of messages. But there was seemingly no way to _actually_ set the prefetch count to zero (ie disable prefetching).\u00e2\u0080\u008dEarning our stripes as SQL maxisWe had a good grasp on what was happening, but we had no immediate way of fixing it. This was causing issues for production customers, so waiting it out wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an option. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure out how to make the queue behave in the way that we wanted it to. We also couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just rip out the queue entirely. Or could we\u00e2\u0080\u00a6It turns out that we could actually recreate the same queue functionality in our Postgres database, but tweak it to match our exact requirements. Better yet, that implementation would be _way_ simpler and fully modifiable in the future if our requirements changed in any way.So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we built: a new queue backed by a single, and surprisingly simple, Postgres table. Our publishers write to it. Our consumers (workers) read from it. We maintain things like queue ordering by adding an ORDER BY clause in the query that consumers use to read from it (groundbreaking, we know). And we guarantee that jobs won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be picked up by more than one worker through simple read/write row-level locks. The new system is actually kind of absurdly simple when you look at it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also behaved flawlessly so far.It comes with several, significant upsides for our team. For one, the application state is no longer spread out over two systems (RabbitMQ storage and Postgres). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now centralized in our application database. This makes disaster recovery that much easier, and increases the resiliency of the overall system by removing moving pieces.Better yet, we all understand this queuing system _really_ well since we wrote it and are all fluent in SQL. This allows us to tweak it if we need to update its behavior, and makes monitoring and debugging easier. We already have plenty of tooling set up to deal with Postgres, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to remember how to set up this one different piece of infra like we did with RabbitMQ. That may not sound like much, but the delta in time and complexity makes a world of difference during an outage.One of our team members has gotten into the habit of pointing out that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can do this in Postgres\u00e2\u0080\u009d whenever we do some kind of system design or talk about implementing a new feature. So much so that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of become a meme at the company. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason for it: he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. It turns out that, when your problem involves enforcing constraints on your data, you can do it in Postgres, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably way simpler than the mountains of code you were going to write for it otherwise.

The underlying issue was fixed when they rewrote the message fetching code for Postgres. They suggested using different queues based on job duration and adding a dead letter queue for both long and short jobs. Using Postgres for low-volume jobs was considered valid, but this setup might need reconsideration for higher volumes. Some users question whether RabbitMQ is a good fit for long-running jobs, with some suggesting using Postgres instead for easier job tracking and deletion.

Some users express their preference for SQL tables, while others suggest using RabbitMQ or other queue management solutions. Suggestions include multiple queue solutions for optimizing job types, and sharing queues to avoid frustration. Some users also mention using SQLite or in-memory databases, and caution against benchmarking traffic by daily traffic volumes. Overall, the discussion highlights a range of options and considerations for efficient and versatile queue management.Users on Hacker News are discussing the use of Postgres as a queue, with some pointing out that it can handle millions of jobs per day as a queue. However, concerns are raised about queue size and disk throughput. Some users suggest using different queue infrastructures for different applications. One user mentions using SQLite and enabling the write-ahead log to maintain disk throughput, while another suggests using a \"transactional outbox\" pattern for processing incoming messages in-order. Overall, relying on Postgres as a queue may work for some applications, but carefully considering the design of the queue infrastructure is important.A discussion on Hacker News highlights the benefits of using Postgres as a message queue due to its transactional semantics and simplified database transactions. While some users argue that using messaging queues in databases is no different than using tables and row locks directly, others emphasize the importance of avoiding race conditions by utilizing decorators or transactional outbox patterns. Postgres is also touted as a solution for all types of data storage, eliminating the need for multiple resources for different use cases. However, caution is advised when using Postgres as a blob store.The use of PostgreSQL as an event queue or message broker is discussed on Hacker News, with some HN users pointing out the advantages of using a database as a queue and others suggesting that using an actual queue solution may be easier; the article recommends the use of PostgreSQL for queuing because it is a simpler solution and because PostgreSQL\u00a0queues are easy to manage; according to the article, the use of PostgreSQL also allows the user to easily implement basic queue features, like prioritizing tasks or ensuring that only one worker picks up a task at a time.\u00a0Discussion on the use of AMQP clients and Postgres for job queues among Hacker News (HN) users. Some users suggest alternative ways to avoid polling, such as using NOTIFY in Postgres or MongoDB's change event stream. Others mention their own experiences with creating message queues and recommend specific tools. There are also discussions about the pros and cons of using advisory locks compared to row locks in Postgres. One comment highlights a potential issue with hunting for more than the allocated memory space for locks in Postgres. Some comments contain sarcasm and criticism towards the original article's perceived exaggeration and mistake.Prequel shares their experience of replacing RabbitMQ with a Postgres queue for their job manager, highlighting the benefits of using a DB/SQL-backed queue for granular control and simplicity. They mention trade-offs and trade-offs in choosing technology for specific use cases and discuss resolving the contention issue by using SKIP LOCKED. Users share their own experiences with different queue systems such as Graphile Worker, Apache Pulsar, and AWS Batch. One user recommends thinking about horizontal scalability, and another notes the importance of listing exact needs when selecting a tool. There is a brief discussion about handling stale 'processing' jobs in a Postgres-backed queue.Developers can use a database as a queue by querying it for the next job, but should consider adding a queue when too many workers overload the database. While using a database as a queue is not recommended, it can allow for easy prioritization, canceling and dynamic controls for queued jobs. A clear understanding of workload, SQL, and database is crucial when implementing a queue in Postgres. It is essential to consider short leases to scale the number of database connections and garbage pages while processing data. Developers should not be quick to dismiss fundamentals while choosing between resources like RabbitMQ and Postgres.

    "hn_content": "Anthropic has announced a four-year plan to take on OpenAI in a $5 billion investment. The plan aims to build impactful technology that goes beyond just the research level. Apple's future Mx chip with a more capable Neural Engine and greater RAM is expected to run the largest GPT3 class models locally, with better developer tools for targeted neural engine (NE) compilers. Trust and privacy concerns are noted, as cloud solutions require trusting third parties with data, while local models will require more than privacy to move locally. Latency, flexibility, and cost are more likely extending factors. There is an incentive to change LLMs off research quality to mass-market quality.Experts on Hacker News are discussing the idea of locally running language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT instead of relying on hosted models, but some users express doubts about its feasibility for common use cases. One user suggests that the buzz around llama.cpp indicates a desire for large LLMs to be available outside of a subscription model. Users debate whether an iPhone or a high-end MacBook would be better suited for running LLMs locally, but others note that LLMs are primarily intended for large-scale usage and unlikely to become a commodity. However, some believe that Apple's unified memory model on the M1/M2 ARM chips make them well-suited for AI applications.Apple has released libraries for using its Neural Engine in CoreML, and a library to use Apple Silicon for training via PyTorch. The size of models loaded on the Neural Engine is limited and has to run on CPU when it exceeds this limit. However, full memory usage could significantly enhance the speed and reduce the computational power required for huge models such as GPT-3. Apple's move to make stable diffusion run well on the iPhone implies they might be waiting for open models before committing to any. Siri was launched with a server-based approach, so Apple could use a small LLM on local chips/MacOS and a large model running in the cloud. Dario Amodei split from OpenAI and founded Anthropic, a public benefit corporation. Anthropic was heavily focused on research for the first year and a half of its existence, but it fully committed to commercialization in September 2022 after developing a strategy for go-to-market and initial product specialization. They have plans for a billion-dollar investment in training their next Claude version.Anthropic's trademark and domain name history is creating confusion regarding their relationship with Google-supported OpenAI. Some users speculate about the challenges of non-profit commercialization, while others note the potential for AI systems to violate censorship rules. The discussion leads to a debate about the necessity of private payment processors and credit card companies, and whether blockchain or other modern solutions could replace them. However, most companies choose the current system, which is familiar and easy to use, and they prioritize fast payments over buyer protection or credit offers. In the end, there is some support for crypto as an anti-censorship currency, but its workability is questioned, and it still has fees and off-ramps.A discussion on payments systems, cryptocurrency, and regulations took place on Hacker News. While one user discussed the potential success of programmable money, others shared insights on existing payment systems like Unified Payments Interface and GiroPay. The conversation also touched on the regulation of payment processors and the reputational concerns of companies in relation to adult content. The thread also dove into topics around capitalism and greed, with some questioning why banks and credit card companies refuse to process sex-related transactions if there's an obvious profit center to explore. In conclusion, the discussion covered a wide range of topics surrounding payments and regulation.Visa and MasterCard control more than 75% of the US market, making having access to a debit/credit card crucial for participation in modern life. However, legislating obedience is not the solution to their control over the market, and regulators' partnerships with big businesses may not lead to improvement. Despite the potential for companies to take control away from them with a few clicks, there are limitations to taking all payments in cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the usage of crypto for server/domain purchases is relatively easy. Notably, the market for chatbots driven by NSFW generative AI is rapidly developing, but debates abound over the potential creation of illegal content and the liability faced by providers of such a service. Lastly, skeptical comments have been raised about the efficacy of measuring oneself against the leading edge of today.Anthropic, a startup focused on creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems, received $124 million in Series B funding from investors including Google and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. However, some commentators argue that Anthropic faces steep competition from other companies, particularly OpenAI. The future of the AGI market remains uncertain, with differing opinions on the potential size and impact of the market. While the market may be dominated by a few players, there is still room for smaller companies to capture market share in the long tail.Experts debate the likelihood of AI displacing human jobs and the potential benefits it could bring to the economy. The future of the moats surrounding large language models is uncertain, and smaller players may eventually be forced out of the market or need to find a specific niche. Open-source models are becoming increasingly popular, but their B2B use cases remain doubtful. LLM prices might hit rock bottom as smaller firms and investors try to use uncensored models to their advantage, and AI becomes a commodity. Companies are yet to realize how important uncensored models can be when it comes to medical and finance applications. Finally, the discussion of whether AI is indeed a pyramid scheme is yet to be resolved.The comments are focused on the potential profitability of foundational models in AI and whether investing in them is worth the risk. Some argue that even if the models themselves do not generate substantial revenue, having top talent working on them is valuable. Others point out that investing in the models may be like a pyramid scheme where early investors profit from latecomers pouring money in. There is also discussion on the potential emergence of new AI techniques in the future and whether open-core approaches or proprietary models will be the winners. The article notes that investing in AI is still a high-risk endeavor and that the comments showcase a range of opinions on the matter.No summary provided.",
    "hn_summary": "Anthropic plans to spend $5 billion over four years to take on OpenAI in developing impactful technology.

The developers have clarified that this minimum fee is to cover operating costs, and they encourage more transparency by calling it a fee. Users have suggested implementing a 5% or X dollars minimum to avoid forcing a 5% minimum for all payments, and have asked for the ability to manually add projects to the system. Nevertheless, developers have defended their position and their innovative platform has gained traction as a way to support open source.Comments on Hacker News discuss the issue of open-source project funding, particularly how donations often aren't enough to cover expenses due to fees charged by payment processors. Some suggest that platforms like Stripe could help by waiving fees for donations, but others argue that someone has to cover those costs. Some commenters advise individual donors to use methods like SEPA IBAN transfers or to set up monthly donations, while others suggest taking a tip jar-style approach or using sliders to let donors choose how their money is spent. Some note that many open-source projects aren't funded at all, with affiliate income often proving more lucrative than donations.Thanks.dev is a new platform for open source project funding, where GitHub dependencies are scanned, and donations are split among them. The platform allows users to adjust the donation amount for each dependency, and has a recommendation system based on usage. Despite concerns around the 5% flat fee for safety and maintenance reasons, users are positive about the platform's impact on motivating maintainers and helping to streamline funding. The platform also offers a \"boosting\" option to reward maintainers indirectly contributing to their GitHub accounts, and tools to promote funding for non-code tools. Overall, thanks.dev offers a new way to contribute to the ecosystem without leaving a tangential impact for maintaining and organizing crowdsourced funding.A new platform called 'Thanks!' automates the process of finding open source software and dependencies for donating money and sponsoring. It aims to fund developers who contribute to often-overlooked dependencies and help sustain their work. The project plans to open-source the code, and currently accepts contributions via GitHub sponsors and PayPal. However, many HN users shared concerns over the choice of middlemen and the need for invoices, and suggested using cryptocurrency or paid feature requests/support. Some users also pointed out the potential risks of transparency and accountability and mentioned existing similar services and platforms. Despite these reservations, the idea has been received positively, and many users showed an interest in contributing to the platform.Developers explain how open-source software (OSS) works and why it is not driven by money but rather by value creation, recognition, and personal satisfaction. HN users discuss funding approaches for OSS, including thanks.dev, which facilitates trickling funds down to dependencies, and NimbusWS, which suggests contributing a small percentage of revenue back to F/OSS projects. However, concerns arise regarding the security of tools like thanks.dev, which scans repositories for dependencies, and the effectiveness of funding approaches in encouraging more support. Some OSS developers argue the need for greater recognition and funding to incentivize contributions and maintenance.Thanks.dev is a new platform that calculates the weight of each dependency in your codebase and distributes monthly budgets accordingly to ensure deep nested dependencies are not neglected. Users can pick a contribution level, and the service automatically donates to their favorite projects. Many maintainers aren't non-profits, so they don't take donations, hence the use of the term \"sponsor\" is preferred. The platform distributes micro-payments up to three deep levels into the dependency tree, has the potential to increase competition and make ends meet, but users note concerns around full access to their repos. There are also initiatives by governments to invest in open-source projects.",

    "content": "A new paper presented at VLDB'17 presents NAM-DB, a scalable distributed database system that leverages remote direct memory access (RDMA) and a novel timestamp oracle to support snapshot isolation (SI) transactions. The paper offers an interesting approach to achieve scalability of distributed transactions by eliminating the CPU overhead of the TCP/IP stack with the use of one-way RDMA. The NAM architecture logically decouples compute and storage nodes and uses RDMA for communication between all nodes. Scalability results show that NAM-DB achieves linear scale-out for throughput while keeping a low latency, outperforming other RDMA-based systems such as FaRM. However, the global stall caused by memory server failures in the event of recovery is problematic for production use.A collection of papers and blog posts about Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System, Virtual Time and Global States of Distributed Systems, and Practical uses of synchronized clocks in distributed systems were listed in chronological order. The Silo paper, a single-node multi-core in-memory database that avoids all centralized contention points, is impressive, achieving almost 700,000 transactions per second on a standard TPC-C workload mix on a 32-core machine, and garnered 445 citations in 10 years. Researchers from academia and industry recently released a state-of-the-union (SOTU) report on database research indicating the SOTU is strong and growing stronger thanks to cloud computing and machine learning. Amazon Aurora's design, covered by the Sigmod 17 and Sigmod 18 papers from the Aurora team, is also noteworthy, as it uses MySQL or PostgreSQL for the database instance at the top and decouples the storage to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service.",

There may be slow adoption of distributed database designs due to limitations in cloud environments, and the atomic clock may be crucial for achieving global consistency. Distributed transactions are inherently latency-bound, rather than CPU or memory-bound, but RDMA may be tricky to program. The posted comments contain additional information on the topic, including where to find useful context graphics and repositories for further discussion.A multi-writer distributed database without partitions can be built by 'flipping some lock bits' and using cache-coherence messages, enabling round-robin messaging for any writer-compute-node. Further implementation of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) could be possible. An HN user points out a better way to do this with a shared-nothing architecture. An article about GCP VMs with atomic clocks prompts discussion on time synchronization over unknown latencies, and whether physical clocks can be trusted for distributed systems. An HN user achieved accurate timestamps using NTP servers from their ISP. The implementation of reliability for an RDMA database raises concerns about node downtime and adversarial behavior.

If you\u2019ve been using the Supabase CLI to serve functions then you\u2019re already one of our Beta testers (thanks!).Host your Edge Functions anywhereWe launched Supabase Edge Functions a little more than a year ago. We use Deno Deploy to host your edge functions globally across 30+ data centers, so your users get super fast responses. This setup works great for us! We didn\u2019t have an easy solution for self-hosting Edge Functions. We\u2019re releasing Edge Runtime to address this.One of our core principles is \u201cEverything is portable\u201d, meaning you should be able to take any part of the Supabase stack and host it yourself.Supabase Edge Runtime is a web server written in Rust that uses a custom Deno runtime. It can serve TypeScript, JavaScript, and WASM functions. All your existing Edge Functions run on Edge Runtime without changing a single line of code.Better local development experienceSelf-hosting is not the only benefit of Edge Runtime. It will improve the local development experience of Edge Functions.Serve all functionsSupabase CLI can now serve all local Edge Functions by running supabase functions serve. Previously, you could only serve a single Edge Function at a time. This was not a great experience for local development. Some of you even devised clever hacks to get around this limitation.When you run supabase functions serve, the CLI uses Edge Runtime to serve all functions. It supports JWT verification, import maps, and passing custom environment variables. It hot-reloads local changes, giving you a seamless development experience.Dev/Prod parityEdge Runtime improves Dev/Prod parity for Edge Functions. You may have encountered issues where an Edge Function works locally but fails when deployed. The main cause for this is Deno Deploy Runtime is more restrictive and only supports a subset of Deno APIs. Edge Runtime exposes the same APIs available in the Deno Deploy Runtime. This will help you spot issues faster while developing and avoid surprises when deploying.Enforcing memory/duration limitsAnother neat feature we built into Edge Runtime is the option to enforce limits on memory and wall-clock durations. Currently, we are setting them to sensible defaults (memory set to 150 MB and execution duration set to 60s). This will allow you to simulate your functions\u2019 resource usage and handle the behavior if they run into the limits. Soon we will allow configuring these limits via CLI config so that you can match them with the real limits of the deployment platform.How to self-host Edge FunctionsWe have put together a demo on how to self-host edge functions on Fly.io (you can also use other providers like Digital Ocean or AWS).To try it yourself:Sign up for an Fly.io account and install flyctlClone the demo repository to your machineCopy your Edge Function into the ./functions directory in the demo repo.Update the Dockerfile to pull the latest edge-runtime image (check releases)Optionally edit ./functions/main/index.ts, adding any other request preprocessing logic (for example, you can enable JWT validation, handle CORS requests)Run fly launch to create a new app to serve your Edge FunctionsAccess your Edge Function by visiting:https://{your-app-name}.fly.dev/{your-function-name}View the logs for the Edge Runtime by visiting Fly.io\u2019s Dashboard > Your App > Metrics. You can serve Edge Runtime from multiple regions by running fly regions add [REGION].Standing on the shoulders of DenoYou may wonder why we cannot use Deno Runtime to self-host functions. Isn\u2019t it open-source and available as a Docker container?Deno Runtime, by default, includes a wide array of built-in APIs, making it easy to use for multiple use cases out of the box. However, this makes it difficult to use for serving web requests. You need the runtime embedded within a web server that can boot fast and, for security, has a more restricted API.However, Deno\u2019s architecture makes it easy to extend its core capabilities and create a customized runtime to match our needs. Deno provides a Rust crate called deno_core, which abstracts the interactions with V8 JavaScript engine. Using deno_core we can create a JS context (known as a V8 Isolate). A V8 isolate has minimal overhead to boot up and a single process can host multiple V8 isolates. When you load a web page that contains scripts from multiple domains in a browser, each of them runs in a separate v8 isolate.Deno team has a detailed 2-part blog post on how to create a custom runtime.Edge Runtime implements an HTTP server (using hyper) that listens to incoming requests. When Edge Runtime is booted, it spins up a JS context (V8 isolate), which we call the Main Worker. Main Worker runs in a separate thread, executing the provided main module. When a new HTTP request is received, the Rust runtime will forward it to the Main Worker.You can write a main module to handle all incoming requests. This would look like a typical Deno Edge Function. The main difference is that it has access to a global object called \u201cEdgeRuntime\u201d.EdgeRuntime global provides methods to create and access UserWorkers. Main Worker can optionally delegate a request to a UserWorker to handle and respond.User Workers are separate JS contexts (V8 isolates) that can run a given Edge Function. They have a restricted API (for example, they don\u2019t get access to the host machine\u2019s environment variables). You can also control the memory and duration a User Worker can run.Here\u2019s a simple implementation of a Main Worker that receives a request, then creates a User Worker and passes the handling of request to the worker.serve(async (req: Request) => { const memoryLimitMb = 150 const workerTimeoutMs = 1 * 60 * 1000 const noModuleCache = false const importMapPath = null const envVars = [  ['USER', 'foo'],  ['PASSWORD', 'BAR'], ] try {  const worker = await EdgeRuntime.userWorkers.create({   servicePath,   memoryLimitMb,   workerTimeoutMs,   noModuleCache,   importMapPath,   envVars,  })  return await worker.fetch(req) } catch (e) {  const error = { msg: e.toString() }  return new Response(JSON.stringify(error), {   status: 500,   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },  }) }})What\u2019s Next?Open-sourcing Edge Runtime is the first step of an exciting roadmap we have planned for Edge Functions. In the coming months, you will see tighter integrations with the rest of the Supabase ecosystem. Here are some sneak peeks at what is to come next.API Gateway to other Supabase servicesWe plan to use Edge Runtime as a replacement for Kong, acting as an API gateway to other Supabase services. This will not only simplify the self-hosting setup but also give you the option to do Request pre/post-processing using JavaScript.Here\u2019s a simple example of re-routing a request to a different endpoint using Edge Runtime.serve(async (req) => { try {  if (req.url.endsWith('/rest/v1/old_table')) {   return await fetch('http://rest:3000/rest/v1/new_table', {    headers: req.headers,    method: req.method,    body: req.body,   })  } } catch (e) {  const error = { msg: e.toString() }  return new Response(JSON.stringify(error), {   status: 500,   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },  }) }})Scheduled FunctionsSince Edge Runtime\u2019s Main Worker runs in the background as long as the server is running, we can utilize it to run periodic tasks.For example, here\u2019s a naive implementation of how it can be used to trigger a function every 2 minutes. In production, you need to account for server restarts and timer resetting.const interval = 2 * 60 * 1000 // 2 minutestry { const worker = await EdgeRuntime.userWorkers.create({  servicePath,  memoryLimitMb,  workerTimeoutMs,  noModuleCache,  importMapPath,  envVars, }) const req = new Request('http://localhost/scheduled-job') setInterval(() => worker.fetch(req), interval)} catch (e) { console.error(e)}Custom Global ObjectsAnother exciting thing about shipping a custom JavaScript runtime is that we can control the available global objects in the runtime. In previous examples, you may noticed we used EdgeRuntime without importing a specific module to our function, this was possible because we exposed it as a global object in the runtime.We can introduce a Supabase global object that can provide platform specific features. For example, similar to Deno.writeTextFile , we can expose a Supabase.writeTextFile which can directly write a file to Supabase Storage.We \ud83d\udc9a\u00a0ContributionsWe are excited to build Edge Runtime in public and involve the Supabase community in the process. As an initial beta release, there are still bugs and performance quirks to be ironed out. Don\u2019t shy away from trying it though.You can report any issues you encounter in repo\u2019s GitHub issues.

Some Hacker News commenters discuss the cost-benefit of hosting on VPS versus PaaS, praising the former for its flexibility and relatively low cost, and complaining about the way some PaaS providers inflate prices. However, some commenters argue they prefer PaaS for the ease of deployment and maintenance, and for the reduced need to deal with server administration. Other commenters debate the merits of different serverless providers and technologies, with one Supabase engineer revealing future plans for integrating file system access via Supabase Storage.Supabase, a PostgreSQL-based database platform, has released a new feature called Edge Functions that run serverless functions on the edge. The Deno implementation's serverless functions run on V8 isolates, allowing for nearly instantaneous deploys and low cold start times. However, a user reports that Supabase's developer tooling is not yet mature and can be buggy, and suggests that running multiple edge functions can limit scalability. The Supabase team builds products based on user feedback, with developers being very product-focused and user-facing.

    "content": "Jonathan Rosen's article in The Atlantic recounts the story of his childhood best friend, Michael Laudor, who suffered from severe mental illness and harmed the person he loved most; the article reflects upon the failings of America's mental health care system and the need for reform; Rosen advocates for policies that provide respite and adequate care to those who need it the most; the article highlights the importance of early intervention and the need for a cultural shift in attitudes towards severe mental illness.The article recounts the writer's friendship with a childhood friend named Michael who was socially effective and persistent in achieving his goals. Michael had a photographic memory and read at breakneck speed. He fueled the writer's love for Doc Savage and was well-versed in politics and current events. Michael went on to work for a top management consulting firm but quit after experiencing health issues and paranoia. He then pursued writing and stayed in an attic in a grand house owned by community psychiatrists who aimed to leave the world better. The article touches on the failures of community mental-health centers and their aim to treat the whole society instead of focussing on severe patients.The Network's Crisis Handbook detailed how vulnerable members of the community were being criminalized, and how the system failed to support those with mental illness. In 1987, the author visited his childhood friend, Michael Laudor, in a locked ward at Columbia-Presbyterian, struggling with delusions and paranoia. While earlier initiatives aimed to keep people with mental illnesses out of hospitals, Michael's eight-month stay gave doctors time to find the most effective medication. The story raises themes of community care versus institutionalization, and how society treats those with mental health issues.Michael was his struggle with schizophrenia, which posed challenges to his relationships, career prospects, and sense of self. Despite taking antipsychotic medication, Michael was one of many patients who were \"treatment resistant\" due to the conviction that they weren't sick, which complicated his recovery process. Michael's attempt to reintegrate into society was further hampered by the limitations of halfway houses, which offered only short-term solutions for long-term needs. In an unexpected turn of events, Michael's story gained national attention after a glowing profile in The New York Times, which chronicled his journey towards becoming a law school professor while openly acknowledging his schizophrenia.Michael Laudor, a Yale Law graduate suffering from severe schizophrenia, was popular among publishers for his proposed memoir that narrates schizophrenia from the inside out. Michael's book proposal caused a stir, as it resonated well with the movie industries. Michael made little progress on his book but the process inspired filmmakers. The severe delusions and hallucinations that accompanied Michael's illness, which he believed was controlled through his screen, ultimately lead to his fiancee's murder. Schizophrenia expert Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's case study regarding Michael became the subject of his article, \"Why Deinstitutionalization Turned Deadly,\" in which he compares Michael with another severe schizophrenic who killed people after rejecting medication.Author E. Fuller Torrey argues that denying care to mentally ill individuals who are unable to request help is a moral and medical failure. Although changes are slowly emerging in New York and California, nationwide improvements in mental health care and the provision of assisted outpatient treatment remain a concern. Involuntary commitment to hospitals is viewed as controversial, but psychiatrist Katherine Koh suggests that the biggest improvements in mental health can come from such treatment if there is a pre-planned and supported care process afterward. One of the biggest challenges toward reform is pessimism or a sense of resigned hopelessness stemming from failed efforts in the past.The concept of asylum has lost its intended purpose, but change is necessary to address severe mental illness. Solutions must focus on real problems instead of imaginary ones, even if it means acknowledging past mistakes. There is a tragic example of a legal scholar with schizophrenia who could have benefited from forced hospitalization. The author regrets not taking seriously a vague warning from a friend before a tragic event occurred. The article is adapted from a book called The Best Minds: A Story of Friendship, Madness, and the Tragedy of Good Intentions by Jonathan Rosen. Buying the book supports The Atlantic.",
    "summary": "Jonathan Rosen's article in The Atlantic tells the story of his childhood friend, Michael, and highlights the flaws of America's mental health care system, calling for reform that provides adequate care and support to those in need, emphasizing early intervention and cultural change. The article touches on community care versus institutionalization, the failures of community mental-health centers, and the need to support those with mental illness. The author argues for assisted outpatient treatment and acknowledges the controversial nature of involuntary commitment to hospitals, calling for change and a focus on real problems.",

    "hn_content": "Theatlantic.com reports on severe mental illness patients being failed by a broken system; Hacker News user debates the middle ground between forcibly hospitalizing patients and ensuring no vulnerable patients get taken advantage of; efforts to help the homeless and mentally ill failing in San Francisco, according to VonGuard, due to the dominant ideology and absence of proper support; another user mentions their personal experience with trauma following forcible hospitalizations in context of psychiatric treatment.The post discusses the exploitative and exorbitant costs of medical care in America, particularly for those who cannot afford it, which often results in individuals being discharged without a diagnosis and considerable medical debt. One user suggests that there is a public hospital which treats individuals who cannot afford medical care, although this option is not discussed extensively. Another user argues that a person's right to refuse medical treatment cannot be overridden, even in cases where it is clear that they are not mentally sound enough to make such decisions. The lack of adequate support for homeless and mentally ill individuals in San Francisco is also noted, with some advocating for voluntary community treatment programs that are properly funded. Mental wards are criticized for questionable practices, including sleep deprivation, although some argue that these institutions are necessary for addressing severe mental health issues.A discussion on homelessness and mental health issues in society happened on Hacker News. A user points out that homelessness is not about punishing those who follow the rules, but rather about addressing the survival and mental health concerns that contribute to the problem. Some users express their frustration with both the Right and the Left's policies, with one user defining the feeling that they have no \"upper bound\" for compassion/empathy, which crashes and burns when they hit the real world. Another user cites the Great Lakes Region as the area where it's nice to live as poor or of moderate income.The comment section discusses the issue of homelessness and mental illness and possible solutions, with some arguing that treatments should be more helpful and respectful of users' rights to encourage those who need it to seek help. Others argue that some individuals may be beyond reason and unable to accept help, creating a need for a solution that balances compassion with prohibiting behavior that harms others. The commenters acknowledge the complexity of the issue and that sweeping solutions may not be effective without addressing underlying systemic issues. Some also note that certain cities within the Great Lakes region may be more habitable than others and that diversity can vary widely based on location.Comments on a post about homelessness highlight the need for compassion and homes, not forceful mental health treatment, in addressing the issue. Critics point out that shelters are often dangerous and less preferable to being outside, citing a need for smaller, scattered-sized shelters. Some argue that homelessness should be addressed as a public health issue, not one of individual rights, while others suggest repurposing unused spaces for affordable housing. One user speculates that the modern zombie genre is influenced by the issue of homelessness and its impact on cities.A farmer in California is dealing with a tent city of the homeless with multiple problems including human waste, needles, and stolen property which has now caused an influx of rats, coyotes and other scavengers.They have been told by the County Sheriff to file a report as they no longer respond to trespassing calls, and they could be fined for cleaning up the private property. One commenter suggests providing free homes to those who need them, with some claiming this has been successful in other places, although some are concerned about the political opposition it may face. Nonetheless, it is important to consider solutions that benefit society as a whole, with compassion and empathy, rather than just waiting for a perfect solution to fall into place.The comments on this post cover a range of topics, including homelessness, mental illness, and public health. One user argues that \"competence\" is not a binary decision and that it is not helpful to force treatment on people who do not want it. Others point out the challenges of treating mental illness and the limitations of current systems, while still others discuss the ethical implications of forcing people to take medication. There are also discussions of the public response to the pandemic and the balance between personal freedom and public safety. Overall, the comments reveal a complex set of issues that defy simple solutions.A debate around forced medication for individuals with acute mental health issues sparks conversation on vaccination mandates - an HN user argues that mandatory vaccination is more important than mandating treatment for mental illness due to the high ROI and lower harm inflicted. However, other users argue that involuntary treatment for severe mental illness is necessary to protect society from harm, even suggesting that mandatory isolation might be a more reasonable parallel than vaccination. The discussion involves disagreements about whether the current approaches to mental health care are working, as well as concerns about the potential abuses of requiring medical treatment for public benefit.There is a discussion about the best way to handle mental illness, whether it is to prioritize prevention or to address symptoms as they come up. The problem of compulsory care was also raised, with some users advocating for it, while others were concerned about government overreach. There was also a debate about the role of the judicial system in handling mental illness and the difficulty in finding good legal representation for those with severe mental health issues. Finally, the issue of treating mental illness without patient consent was discussed, with some advocating for it based on the need for early intervention and better long-term outcomes, while others raised concerns about patient autonomy.An article discussing the treatment of homeless mentally ill individuals has garnered a variety of opinions, including concerns over punitive measures against homeless individuals and the potential for the abuse of policies. Some commenters argue that involuntary hospitalization may be necessary for those who require mental medication. However, others express discomfort with the mental health industry and the potential lack of oversight or abuse of power that may result from it. The discussion also highlights the difficulties and challenges of navigating the US healthcare system, particularly for those with chronic illnesses or conditions.Comments on a Hacker News post discuss the relationship between intelligence and mental illness, specifically schizophrenia. While there are studies suggesting that higher IQs may help with coping mechanisms and awareness of illness, personal experiences of those with mental illness show that once psychosis takes hold, intelligence cannot control it. The discussion cites the example of John Forbes Nash Jr., whose high IQ did not save him from the severe impact of schizophrenia. The conversation then shifts to the challenges of accessing mental health care in the US, particularly for those who cannot afford it, and how the media often portrays these issues in a \"feel-good\" light.Social mobility in the US is low, and having rich parents is the best way to ensure access to healthcare according to an opinion piece published in The Tech Times. While government price caps and start-ups offering affordable medication are beginning to appear, the problem requires sustainable government intervention to prevent capitalism spiraling out of control. Mental health, drug abuse and crime are linked, but generally, there is little can be done for the management and treatment of incurable mental illnesses. Prevention of the onset of mental illness would be a more feasible and effective approach, but efforts are obstructed by the unpredictable nature of the disease, the absence of available treatment, and present laws that make it hard to legislate. Misdiagnosis is also rampant due to the delicate nature and complexity of mental health issues.A former associate of Bain & Company shares their negative experiences, including excessive spending and pressure to make up things for customers. A mentor's criticism led to an intense conversation and a dark comment about jumping out a window, which was tragically fulfilled when a Goldman Sachs associate jumped out of a nearby window a week later. The author resigned a week after that incident. A discussion in the comments section highlights the debate about whether drug use can induce schizophrenia, with one citing a study linking cannabis use to increased risk of psychosis in vulnerable people. Some comments share personal experiences with drug-induced psychosis. Applications are open for YC Summer 2023.",
    "hn_summary": "A broken mental health system leaves patients with severe mental illnesses uncared for, as necessary support efforts fail due to the dominant ideologies and lack of proper funding. The discussion in the comments section covers a range of topics, including homelessness, mental illness, public health, and the difficulty of finding effective solutions without addressing systemic issues. Additionally, concerns over the potential abuse of policies and the difficulty in accessing mental health care in the US arise."

    "content": "A freelance writer lost their main income source, a marketer who outsources writing, to ChatGPT. The client stated that despite the AI's inferior quality, the profit margin cannot be ignored. The writer emphasizes that quality may not matter to businesses and clients who prioritize profit margins, and that chatbots and AI are already replacing customer service teams. While some comments offer opinions on AI and its impact on the freelance writing profession, it is advised to distinguish between opinions and facts. The overall message is that AI, while not necessarily better than human writers, can provide faster and cheaper solutions that many clients prefer.The rise of AI in creative professions poses a significant threat, as it outperforms humans in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness, leading to the loss of clients for traditional professionals. The profit-driven world values quantity over quality, making AI an attractive option for companies seeking to publish content quickly. While some suggest adapting and reskilling, learning new skills takes time, and bills still need to be paid. AI's disruptive capabilities are obvious and could result in a future where artists are not rewarded for their work. Ultimately, professions that can be automated may become obsolete, leading to a society that only values utilitarian work.AI's potential to replace human jobs is a major concern, with some industries like content writing already experiencing disruption. While some believe AI will not replace human creativity, others predict it will automate much of the work. The question arises: will AI value creativity more or less when it is so easily accessible to more people? The growth of AI could potentially make individual contributions and creative outputs much more feasible with reduced effort, bypassing the need for big teams and budgets previously required. Ultimately, AI's impact will be enormously disruptive for everyone, with many getting caught in the crossfire financially at some point.Artificial intelligence (AI) is replacing the work of copy and content writers, but not in a good way as most of that writing is not good in the first place, and AI is trained on that type of writing. The opportunity is to write in ways that stand out against SEO-driven content. Clients may notice that SEO-degraded search engines render AI-produced content ineffective at returning useful results, prompting them to look for more unique pieces of writing. However, the risk is that AI technology may soon replace human writing entirely. Anyone who creates content in a purely online space has no chance against AI, but SEO and persuasive writing that convert are two areas that still take human effort.Writers advised to shift their skillset to include AI prompt engineering to replace lost jobs, with tips and tricks provided by OpenAI, but cautioned against paid courses. Some users believe quality content will always have a market niche, while others predict that the demand for it is in its final years, with clients preferring cheaper and automated writing. One employer's decision to hire automated writing may not reflect the broader market, and catering to target audiences might require more robotic texts, gifs, and less-crafted writing. While high-end writers might survive automation longer, their survival is not guaranteed. Surviving new technologies requires adapting, and manual trades have already faced similar challenges.Content writers are discussing the impact of AI on their profession, with some admitting they are unaffected, while others feel it is hurting their work. One user recommends developing other skills to future-proof oneself, while another reminds that AI's impact is still uncertain, and people should not base their career progression on others' assumptions. Some writers argue that AI-generated content is of lower quality, while others predict that AI will become a threat only temporarily. Some users suggest that AI will result in universal basic income, while others acknowledge that AI will continue to improve, and the impact will only increase. Meanwhile, some users share their similar experiences and sympathize with the impacted writer.The potential threat of AI and automation on jobs is highlighted in an exchange on Reddit's Hacker News forum. One user claims that AI will replace all jobs in the workplace, with the last to go being physical complex labor. According to the user, coders and accountants may be replaceable by AI within the next few years. Despite the possibility of change, there is hope for smart, hardworking individuals with people skills, who may retain value in the future. Other users share similar experiences, with one revealing that their client suggests they utilize ChatGPT to speed up their content creation process.ChatGPT, an AI language model, is discussed by HN users within the context of the freelance writing industry. While ChatGPT can generate grammatically correct and coherent content, professional copywriters bring a range of expertise to the table that AI may not match. Some HN users acknowledge the potential of AI to impact the field of writing, while others maintain that unique human qualities such as creativity, opinion, and personality will always be needed in writing. The discussion also touches on the potential for AI to reduce the need for certain professions, and the importance of upskilling and finding new ways to add value to clients.An expert copywriter laments the impact of AI on their industry, arguing that writers should not see any assignment as boring and that great writing is possible regardless of budget or product type. One reader suggests that writers could differentiate themselves by becoming certified in specific niches. Other comments express skepticism about the true impact of AI on copywriting, warning that the limitations of the technology and the value of human point of view and opinion mean that good writers will always be in demand. Some users express anti-capitalist or anti-corporate sentiments, while others joke about the post's perceived conspiratorial intent.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post contemplates whether AI will replace human writers and content creators, citing a story from a writer who was replaced with ChatGPT. While some view \"content\" as an industry that needs to be devalued into the ground, others recognize the immeasurable contribution that talented artisans add to society. As for AI, it's important to consider that it still requires heavy human interference and will require critical reputation signals to make up for any loss of quality. Overall, it's challenging to predict the many possible outcomes, but ultimately, it's important to recognize that the world is constantly changing and finding new solutions to make a profit.AI-powered content creation has led to the elimination of jobs that were previously done by humans, such as marketing and writing. Users of ChatGPT have reported time savings and cost reductions when using the tool, which can generate polished content that may be on par with human writers. Some users suggest this is a positive development as it eliminates \"bullshit jobs,\" while others highlight potential social unrest resulting from the loss of jobs. In addition, some comments note shifts in cultural values towards greater recognition of unique, original work, rather than generic, AI-generated content. However, LLMs (large language models) may pose a danger because people may struggle to conceptualize the implications of models trained on vast amounts of data.HN users discuss the concept of 'bullshit jobs' and how it reflects on the socioeconomic system. Some argue that a job that improves revenue or profit cannot be considered a 'bullshit job.' The use of AI in content creation is also discussed, with some pointing out that AI output may be cheaper but not necessarily better. An analogy is made to cheap flights being less reliable. The winner-take-all nature of industries like music and movies is mentioned, with only the top 1% truly succeeding. The use of intellectual property is brought up as an example. Coca-Cola is brought up as a company that survives significant competition through their advertising efforts.Experts discuss the quality of AI-generated content versus its volume, with some pointing out that minor differences can create significant variations in the outcome. However, the potential to significantly cut costs by outsourcing to AI remains attractive for many. The conversation moves towards other fields, such as medicine and surgery, and whether AI will replace highly skilled individuals in the future. Meanwhile, concerns arise about the potential impact of relying solely on AI-generated content in fields where accuracy is paramount. Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing debate about AI's role in industries, and whether it can truly replicate the work done by humans.The article discusses the potential for ChatGPT to take over the role of technical writers and the concerns that come with that, including the need for accuracy in compliance related writing. Some users argue that ChatGPT may even be superior in certain areas of writing, but others express concerns about complacency in the face of errors that could slip through without human oversight. Some users highlight the humor of translation errors and suggest that chatbots will not make quality worse, but rather that most writing already on websites and in FAQs is lacking. Others suggest that human interaction will always be valuable and that premium products will continue to come from human writing.The use of AI to generate creative output is disrupting creative industries, with examples such as AI-generated video game posters and copywriting. However, there are debates as to whether AI is a substitute or just an assistant. Some argue that AI is replacing certain jobs, while others argue that it's not yet able to perform all of the necessary tasks. Regardless, there is a potential for a flood of competition in industries where automation has not yet reached. The impact on job security can be significant, and the main challenge for individuals is adapting to the changing tech landscape.Experts discuss the potential of AI replacing human coders, with some arguing that the quality of AI-generated code is currently poor, while others point out that the technology is improving and will likely continue to improve over time. Some predict that as automation continues to replace jobs, a social safety net may become necessary to support displaced workers. Others argue that such concerns are overblown and that automation will ultimately lead to a world without drudgery, freeing people to pursue their hobbies and passions. Still, others warn that the rise of automation could exacerbate inequality, leading to a world with a GINI coefficient approaching 1.Experts on Hacker News are discussing the potential impact of artificial intelligence on various industries, including white-collar jobs such as content writing and programming. Some commenters express concern for those who may lose their jobs, while others argue that this disruption is simply a part of progress. Mention is made of GPT-4, a particularly effective AI language model capable of generating content quickly and cheaply. Some express skepticism about the quality of such generated content, while others suggest that it may be good enough for certain applications. The discussion also touches on the global impact of such AI disruption, particularly on areas with lower-valued markets. Overall, the conversation highlights the need for society to adapt to a rapidly changing technological landscape.An article on Hacker News discusses the idea of replacing human writers with AI, citing examples of AI-driven copywriters and the capabilities of GTP. Some comments express support for the idea, arguing that AI can produce better and more efficient output. However, others argue that AI cannot replace the creativity and insight that humans bring to writing. The authenticity of the article is called into question by some comments, but others point out that the author is a professional writer and marketer. Ultimately, the debate around AI and writing highlights the ongoing advancements in technology and their potential impact on various industries.",

You can see a quick video of it here [1]. After I got a basic prototype working, there was just something satisfying about collecting all the cards, shuffling them, and then re-distributing them into a grid.I noticed that deck.of.cards doesn't have a flip animation, but maybe that's a good thing. The typical animation you see when a card is just flipped by rotating about one of the axes just \"feels\" wrong to me. It breaks the illusion somehow, but maybe there's a better way to do it.[1] https://mastodon.social/@allenu/109952125506805902Edit: You may need to hover over the GIF in the link to get the animation to start.

    "hn_content": "The article \"Rules for developers to design beautiful UIs without a designer\" has garnered a lot of attention on Hacker News, with both positive and negative feedback. Some readers feel that focusing only on the \"polish\" of a design overshadows more critical factors such as user flow, functionality, and placement of buttons. Others argue that aesthetics are just as important in attracting consumers and that beauty sells. The debate between form and function continues, and UX designers must balance engineering with art to make a product that is both functional and visually appealing.Design and functionality are both important in creating an effective product, and attempting to separate the two can lead to a subpar outcome. Good aesthetic design can enhance usability, but it is important not to confuse design with art. While designers may be tempted to create a highly unique design, they should learn and follow recognized design best practices, especially when it comes to supporting localization. The recent trend of \"dribbble-raised designers\" may contribute to a lack of understanding of design principles. However, both functional and visual design are important, and a balance between the two is key to creating a successful product.Comments on a Hacker News post discuss issues with material UI design and the overuse of pop-up windows and other anti-UX patterns. A UI designer advises on dealing with disagreements in design and strategies for user research. Some comments criticize design rules, calling for a focus on usability over aesthetics. The importance of information hierarchy and intuitive interaction design is emphasized. The discussion highlights the pitfalls of over-reliance on visual design trends at the expense of usability.A post on Hacker News describes how to use borders intentionally instead of avoiding them altogether; an example screenshot shows using fewer borders to highlight a single row from a table. Some users criticize the example and suggest better alternatives like making the selection hint more saturated than a field bg; others criticize the focus on beauty over usability. Users also suggest the importance of feedback, contrast, and functionality over aesthetics in UI/UX design. Despite controversy, the accompanying book has sold over 20,000 copies as of posting. As a side note, some users express frustration over automatically disappearing elements in UI, such as disappearing scrollbars.A book recommended for its comprehensive guide on UI design and tailoring the interface design process without containing any code is worth the $100 price tag, but some readers argue that a pdf costs too much. Borders are a great way to distinguish two elements from one another, but using too many of them can make designs feel cluttered, but individual preferences may differ. Users assert that the designer should care about creating a great UI instead of only making it pretty. \"Feel for it\" cannot be taught in boot camp or crash courses; it develops with time and experience. Although busy designs may be unappealing, they allow higher contrast and better visibility for a large amount of data.A book on UI design is being advertised on HN, which has received positive reviews from some users. Many users have also expressed interest in a physical copy of the book. Some users have made sarcastic comments regarding the advertisement, while others have recommended following the author on Twitter. One user recommends using an AI language model to design web pages, while another user noted that the book focuses on design rather than UX. The book costs $100, sparking a discussion regarding the advertisement budget.",

Great language, great tools, and a helpful, welcoming community. It was a perfect introduction to practical functional programming.Haven't found a big project for it yet, but I've done a bunch of little side projects since a friend who worked at Appcues gave me the hard sell on it around 2018. reply  pejrich 7 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > contributor to Livebook and Nx hereWhile accurate, it's a bit of an understatement :) Thanks for all your work, Jose. reply  andy_ppp 4 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Do you ever think about why you\u2019re probably a 100x programmer, is it just working memory and pure intelligence or some strategy or tactics that make you so good at this. Asking for a friend :-) reply  dpflan 9 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Thanks for sharing!The distributed ML currently seems focused on model execution. I see another commenter's excitement about \"Looking forward to NX transformations that take distributed training next level.\" -- which I agree, will be quite interesting.Where / how do you see Nx being used effectively in distributed training? Is distributed training a reality for open-sourced models to compete against big tech models? reply  josevalim 8 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] For distributed training, one important feature is to be able to do GPU-to-GPU communication, such as allreduce, allgather, and all2all. Those are not supported at the moment but they are in our roadmap. At this level, however, it seems the language runtime itself plays a reduced role, so I don't expect the experience to be much different to, say, Python/JAX.For the second question, my understanding is that all big tech models rely on distributed training, so distributed training is a requisite for competing really. reply  Dowwie 7 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Is anyone working on audio libraries that will enable streaming audio chunks for Whisper processing? Saving audio files into a local file system, running ffmpeg to chunk, and then sending them off to Whisper is very tactical.. reply  josevalim 7 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] The current pipeline expects PCM audio blobs and, if data is coming from a microphone in the browser, you can do the initial processing and conversion in the browser (see the JS in this single file Phoenix app speech to text example [0]).On the other hand, if you expect a variety of formats (mp3, wav, etc), then shelling out or embedding ffmpeg is probably the quickest path to achieve something.

    "content": "Language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have gained popularity due to their ability to perform various tasks with incredible skill. In this article, the author explores LLMs, their strengths, weaknesses, and prompt engineering strategies. LLMs are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text ideal for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Prompt engineering strategies can direct LLMs to perform specific tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, question answering, chatbots, text classification, code generation, and reasoning upon its response. Despite their impressive performance, LLMs have several limitations, such as their inability to reason beyond the information provided and generating biased text. Using these prompt engineering strategies allows users to maximize the potential of LLMs.Prompt engineering is essential to maximize the potential of language models like LLMs, with few-shot and chain of thought prompting being viable strategies. LLMs can perform complex tasks, but prompt engineering helps developers harness their power effectively. More strategies and techniques are being developed to optimize LLM potential. As LLMs grow bigger, they will offer solutions for more tasks we cannot even think of yet. Thus, it's exciting to think about the possibilities and the use cases that LLMs will continue to serve us in the future.",

    "hn_content": "A post on Hacker News by ruxudev, titled \"Maximizing the Potential of LLMs: A Guide to Prompt Engineering\" has gained significant attention. While some consider it prompt engineering, others view it as witchcraft or AI. Some users highlight that understanding the problem, expressing it cogently, and considering edge cases are the real meat of software engineering. Additionally, users debate the use of language like \"engineering\" in this context. Meanwhile, other users contributed humorous incantations to summon GPT-IV demon spirits to perform programming tasks. It is essential in such posts to remain neutral and focus on the central topic, omitting trivial information that most readers already understand.A debate on whether individuals who write HTML and CSS should call themselves software engineers leads to discussions about the definition of engineering and the practice of using GPT for software prompts. While some argue that engineering is about precision and reliability, others suggest that it is primarily about making things useful. One individual describes LLMs as \"stochastic sequence completion engines.\" A suggestion is made to use templates or snippet managers to save time.The post discusses \"Prompt Engineering,\" which creates specific prompts for AI language models. Some commenters argue whether it qualifies as engineering. Others discuss security vulnerabilities of concatenating trusted and untrusted text, and propose potential solutions. The author and commenters emphasize the necessity of clear and precise prompts to achieve optimal results with AI language models, which can have a wide range of applications from API calls to bug reports. Assembling prompts programmatically presents challenges and security issues. The article suggests respecting the norms and avoiding incorrect assumptions when communicating with AI language models.Hacker News users discuss the risks of prompt injection and insidious LLM injections that can email people, and the difficulty of mitigating them due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs; some suggest treating AIs as human employees with potential to go rogue; others note the limitations of text-completion LLMs, such as their tendency towards \"mode collapse\" causing similar outputs in style and content; while some feel that prompt engineering is unnecessary with stronger AI models, many think it encompasses broader sequences than simple verbal templates. There is also a comment noting the error in output location from the LLM model.Prompt engineering, a process of interleaving multiple prompts, is becoming essential for getting the most out of modern language models (LLMs) like GPT3/4, however, limitations like token limit still pose obstacles. Splitting large documents into smaller parts, using embedding tools or summarization software like Universal Summarizer can provide workarounds. Though people who think prompt engineering is a new skill they need to learn should understand it's essentially just like writing. Prompt engineering is a bag of tricks that change the probabilities of outputs, thus behaving more like experiments rather than engineering. In conclusion, prompt engineering is evolving and playing a crucial role in LLMs for natural language processing.Users on Hacker News are discussing the use of prompts and interactions in working with language models (LLMs) for generating code. Some users express frustration with the need to craft precise prompts for LLMs, with one user suggesting that the development of an AI that can better understand natural language is a more suitable long-term approach. Others argue that precise prompts are necessary, comparing it to a movie director giving actors direction, and that such prompts will likely evolve towards a more programming language-like structure in the future. There is also a mention of the need for a better way to handle LLM outputs.",

I am not a fan of how churny the js world is, and I come from a background in Swing/Qt/GTK/etc desktop development.I evaluated HTMX as a not-js way to do modern web apps. It was fine, it was certainly interesting. I had some concern about how much pain I would be in for when I inevitably wanted to borrow something from the js ecosystem, like a charting library or something.I actually ended up deciding on godot with gdscript and while I'm not done yet, I'm having a pretty dang good time. I'm a little annoyed that I have to pay apple to get it on iOS, but I have to pay apple anyway because safari is such an annoying odd one out from how firefox and chrome's renderers work.

    "content": "The Coming of Local LLMs - Nick ArnerNick ArnerThe Coming of Local LLMsPosted at \u2014 Mar 23, 2023While there\u2019s been a truly remarkable advance in large language models as they continue to scale up, facilitated by being trained and run on larger and larger GPU clusters, there is still a need to be able to run smaller models on devices that have constraints on memory and processing power.Being able to run models at the edge enables creating applications that may be more sensitive to user privacy or latency considerations - ensuring that user data does not leave the device.This also enables the application to be able to always work without concerns over server outages or degradation, or upstream provider policy or API changes.LLaMA Changes EverythingRecently, the weights of Facebook\u2019s LLaMA model leaked via a torrent posted to 4Chan. This sparked a flurry of open-source activity, including llama.cpp. Authored by the creator of whisper.cpp, it quickly showed that it\u2019s possible to get an LLM running on an M1 Mac:Soon, Anih Thite posted a video of it running on a Google Pixel 6 phone. It was incredibly slow, at 1 token per second, but it was a start.The next day, he posted a new video - showing it running at 5 tokens a second.Artem Andreenko soon was able to get LLaMA running on a Raspberry Pi 4:Kevin Kwok created a fork of llama.cpp that included an add-on for a Chat-GPT style interface:And finally, yesterday, he posted a demonstration of Alpaca running on an iPhone:Consumer Electronics Companies and LLMsWith the rapid advances being made for running local LLMs in the open source community, the question is bound to be asked - what is Apple doing? While Apple does have significant ML capabilities and talent, a look at their ML Jobs Listings does not indicate they are actively hiring for any LLM projects. The cream of the crop of expertise in LLM\u2019s are at OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind.Apple is generally always late to deploying big technological advancements into their products. If and when Apple does develop on-device LLM capabilities, it could either arrive in the form of CoreML models that are embedded in individual apps and come with different flavors; such as summarization, sentiment analysis, and text generation.Or, alternatively, they could deploy a single LLM as part of an OS update. Apps could then interact with the LLM through system frameworks, similar to how the Vision SDK works.This, to me, seems the more likely of the two approaches - both to be sure that each app on a user\u2019s phone does not embed their own, large model bundled with them, and - more importantly - that would allow Apple to have a much more capable version of Siri.It\u2019s incredibly unlikely that Apple will ever license the use of LLMs from outside parties like OpenAI or Anthropic. Their strategy is much more the style of either building it all in-house, or to acquire small startups that they integrate into their products. This is what happened with the Siri acquisition.One consumer electronics company that isn\u2019t shy about having a partnership with OpenAI is Humane. They recently announced a $100M Series C round of financing. While still in stealth, they\u2019re widely considered to be a laser-projector based AR wearable. Such a device would surely have major constraints on power, due to the nature of the laser projector. This would probably have a major restriction on running an embedded LLM, at least in their first version.As part of their fundraising announcement, they did disclose that they\u2019re partnering with several companies, including OpenAI. My guess is that they\u2019re going to use a combination of Whisper and GPT4 for some kind of personal assistant as part of their hardware product. While Whisper has been shown to be quite capable of running on-device, it will probably be some time until a powerful language model will be able to do so in production.Closing ThoughtsI think we\u2019re going to eventually see a demo showing an open source model running on an iPhone as well. I don\u2019t have intuition as to how long it will take until we start seeing these models being baked into production apps, and eventually, into the OS\u2019s themselves. I do anticipate this to eventually happen, opening the door to extremely personal and personalized ML models that we will carry with us in our pockets - having intelligent assistants with us at all times.If you\u2019re doing work in the area of local LLMs, particularly ones that may be able to run on phones or other embedded devices, please reach out.Further ReadingLarge language models are having their Stable Diffusion momentYou can now run a GPT-3-level AI model on your laptop, phone, and Raspberry PiInference at the edge\u00a9 Copyright Nicholas Arner, 2022 |",

A discussion emerges around the merits and limitations of LLAMA and its variants as compared to ChatGPT.A thread on Hacker News discusses the potential for open-source models to democratize access to LLMs, leading to excitement among enthusiasts. However, some users question the feasibility of companies sharing the models for free or working on open-source projects due to risks from regulators and politicians. Others raise questions about the capability of LLMs developed through open-source models, and the limitations of current capabilities to respond to complex queries. Users point out, however, that the models are still valuable testing tools for creativity, thought, and knowledge exploration, despite the limitations.Comments on Hacker News discuss the limitations and benefits of local language model (LLM) training and inference. Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, and LLaMA models are mentioned, with some users considering them underwhelming compared to more advanced models like ChatGPT. Hardware requirements and GPU concerns are also discussed, with some users recommending cloud training over personal GPU purchases. Additionally, users mention the potential for more advanced LLM models on mobile devices, though there is some debate around the feasibility of this. Finally, there is some discussion around the claim that the LLaMA model weights were leaked to the public, with some users clarifying that researchers were able to gain access by request.Apple is potentially entering the NLP space which requires machines to understand human language. Although Apple has a focus on tangible products, they have many job listings for NLP related positions. Hacker News users have mixed opinions about whether Apple is truly behind in ML technologies. The use of local LLMs, while removing data protection problems, can open the door for malicious use on a larger scale. While GPT-4 operates entirely in secret, there are alternative multimodal options available. An individual is running a 7B model on an M1, and tinygrad has an available option to run on Apple's neural cores/GPU cores to even more accelerate the process.",

A user comments about their experience returning items to Amazon, including the disposal of perfectly good returns, which led to a debate about boycotting Amazon. Another user suggests taking legal action.An Amazon customer experienced difficulty in returning a pair of Apple AirPods where the company wanted a \"spurious return fee\" greater than the value of the items and destroyed them, despite mistakenly receiving the wrong box. Some readers expressed concerns about the industry's practice of unreliable decision-making over returned items and the lack of more efficient solutions such as AI integration. Nevertheless, others noted that Amazon still needs to service its number of customers despite fraud and abuse being somewhat unavoidable in e-commerce. OAuth, which grants permissions and access, was blamed for its overly broad scopes allowing apps to gather unnecessary details, however, some readers cautioned to read the permission details before granting access. YouTube's customer service has been criticized after multiple customer complaints, with some pointing out that they treat even paying customers poorly. Despite YouTube's success, and the fact that it caters to content creators who are its lifeblood, it seems to be harsh on them. Several well-known YouTubers have had their channels suspended, making it difficult for creators to diversify and become independent. Many point out that there is currently no alternative to YouTube, as no other company seems willing to take it on. The possibility of having a paid expedited customer service fee to review content is a solution to be considered.A YouTuber raises concerns about Google's lack of customer service, and shares that their channel was terminated without warning or explanation. Other users share their own stories of unfair treatment from large tech companies, highlighting the need for better support and appeal processes. Some suggest that companies prioritize profits over user experience and suggest legal action against such practices. One user points out that the scale of these companies and the number of active users make personal support difficult, while others argue that this should not excuse poor treatment of customers. Ultimately, it's suggested that solutions such as mandatory third-party appeal services may be necessary. One user updates that the YouTuber was able to get their issue resolved after sharing their experience on Hacker News.",

    "content": "Quantum computing will not solve hard problems instantly, according to Scott Aaronson, whose GPT-4 AI scored a B on an honors upper-level undergrad exam in quantum information science at UT Austin. Receiving a score of 73/100, Bryan Caplan and others have agreed this is an achievement in itself. Aaronson explains how the quantum circuits challenged GPT-4 but that it was strongest on true/false and conceptual questions. Students who struggle dropped the course before the end, however Aaronson said it was possible that fine-tuning or few-shot prompting with his other exams or lecture notes could boost GPT-4\u2019s performance. Lattice-based cryptography winning the secure post-quantum public-key cryptography, and problems still being unsolvable in polynomial time are true, and\u00a0density matrices always having eigenvalues in the [0,1] range is also true.A quantum circuit that prepares $\\ket{\\psi}$ from an all-0 initial state is described, consisting of several quantum gates and one $\\ket{\\psi}$ measurement. Engineering constraints, decoherence and noise, and cooling requirements make it practically impossible to speed up a quantum computation by increasing the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, even though it may be theoretically possible. HN users point out limitations on this as well as factors preventing the simulation of Simon's algorithm. Further questions are related to the order of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{Z}_N^\\times$. One user provides a quantum solution to factorize $N=105$ into $3\\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.",

    "hn_content": "An HN user shares that while GPT-4 passing a difficult exam is impressive, there is still a need to be cautious about relying too much on AI. Some users question if GPT-4 may have had access to exam questions beforehand. Others debate whether AI can replace humans in various fields, with medical radiology being a point of discussion. ChatGPT was able to find an issue that a team of doctors and nurses missed. Ultimately, the discussion revolves around the limitations of AI and the importance of human oversight.A discussion on Hacker News centered around the use of AI in medicine, particularly image recognition and statistics being used as a first pass for pathologists. One user argues that AI could aid in catching cancer earlier, especially non-lump forming types. However, others express concerns about relying too heavily on AI, citing the need for human review and the potential for errors to compound. The conversation also touches on the use of AI in other fields and the importance of balance between AI and human input. Overall, the discussion highlights the potential benefits and risks associated with the increased use of AI in various industries.Experts on HN discuss the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, with some arguing that liability issues need to be solved before the technology is accepted by society. Others argue that even if autonomous vehicles are not perfect, they would still be a safer option compared to human-driven ones. The conversation is not limited to autonomous vehicles, with HN users discussing the remarkable progress made in AI technology, particularly in language processing. Some express amazement at how easy it is to interact with LLMs like GPT-4, while others remain skeptical of the technology's ability to judge literature on its artistic merits.A letter discussing the subject of Mount Analogue, its existence, and a potential expedition is translated from French to English by various sources including ChatGPT and GPT-4. The conversation between various users concludes that while GPT-4's translation is more literary, ChatGPT's is more functional, accurately translating with simple English requests. However, the limitations of machine translations and the nuances of language are noted. The letter itself speaks of a sense of stagnancy in the recipient's life, and a desire for adventure and exploration. The reader is called to respond, and to embark on a journey beyond the mundane.Learning a new language opens a new world of vocabulary, just like learning a new programming language. However, some think it is not worth the significant investment of time and money since it has little economic upside. Yet, being fluent enough to make a pun in a foreign language is wholly worth it. Machine translation has improved significantly but still has some limitations, such as difficulty recognizing sentence structures and idioms unique to a language. Nevertheless, using machine translation is faster than relying on someone's language skills, especially when doing mundane tasks such as filling out forms. While some remain skeptical about machine translation's ability to handle more complex translations, experts attest that GPT-4 can translate abstract concepts across multiple novels with considerable accuracy.Commentators on a recent Hacker News post debate the reliability of GPT-4's translation ability, with some users pointing out that the corpus includes training sets for some idioms and common phrases. Others argue that machine translation still cannot capture the nuance required to understand certain sentences or colloquialisms, as evidenced by a discussion of a Doctor Who episode that features a pun. True/false and multiple choice questions on exams are common, particularly in larger classes, sparking a debate on whether they are a lazy way of grading.ChatGPT, a chatbot using GPT-3, has passed an exam on quantum computing at the University of Texas at Austin, to widespread interest on Hacker News. While some pointed out the ability for both AI and humans to memorize and pattern match calculable problems, others questioned how AI will be certified if it certifies itself, while others saw its advance as evidence of the impact AI may have on jobs. Commentators observed that the AI could answer true/false questions and pattern-matching questions easily, but struggled with problems requiring longer calculations. ChatGPT's performance prompted many to think deeply about the trajectory and ultimate potential impact of AI.A new article on Hacker News discusses how GPT-4 has taken a final exam for a graduate Quantum Mechanics course and scored 64% correct, surpassing the scores of GPT-3.5-TURBO. The comments on the post discuss the limitations of GPT-4's capabilities, with some suggesting that it is superhuman in the amount of expert knowledge it possesses, but lacks reasoning skills to generate new knowledge. Others point out that the AI's ability to solve equations is not purely based on seeing the problem before, but rather on understanding the rules underlying the operations. Overall, the post highlights the progress in AI capabilities and the implications for human-computer interaction.Quantum computing and its associated complicated exams were discussed by experts on Hacker News. The quantum state of an n-qubit system is represented by a 2^n-dimensional complex unit vector, according to the initial post. The thread also touched on the difficulty of quantum computing exams, in addition to questioning whether AI co-pilots could be used in programming. The quality of exams, particularly those designed for LLMs, was also scrutinized. While some regarded the tests as insufficient measures of technical knowledge, others found some of the questions relatively easy and comfortably answered them.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35524328",
    "content": "# OpenOwl \ud83e\udd89OpenOwl lets you download user lists including user permissions (and other additional data) from various SaaS applications without the need for a public API. This tool is commonly used to check for orphaned user accounts or as preparation for an access review.This project is made with IT Ops, InfoSec and Compliance teams in mind - no developer experience needed. The [`recipes.yml`](recipes.yml) lists all supported applications. You are welcome to contribute to this project by setting up additional vendor integrations.## How to run itSince OpenOwl uses various technologies running it with Docker is recommended. There are additional instructions if you want to run it directly.### Option 1: Shell Wrapper with [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Recommended)The Docker image is built automatically with the first launch.#### Show all available applications a.k.a recipes```bash./owl.sh recipes list```#### Step 1. Run `login` action Following is an example on how to use it with [`Mezmo`](https://www.mezmo.com/)Parameters like `OWL_USERNAME` and `OWL_PASSWORD` are passed via the environment variable.```bashOWL_USERNAME=someone@acme.com OWL_PASSWORD=abc123 ./owl.sh mezmo login```#### Step 2. Run `download_users` action```bash./owl.sh mezmo download_users```Depending on the application there might be additonal parameters required which will be listed after running the command. If that is the case, add the parameters and re-run the command.Example for additional parameters:In [recipes.yml](recipes.yml) you can see that there is a placeholder defined for Mezmo. Placeholders start with a `:` and look like this: `:account_id`. Depending on the recipe they are either passed as parameter or populated from other data (e.g. see Adobe). To pass the `:account_id` parameter, you prefix it with `OWL_` and upcase it. So `:account_id` becomes `OWL_ACCOUNT_ID`.```bashOWL_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID ./owl.sh mezmo download_users```### Option 2: Docker ComposeExamples:```bashdocker compose run owl recipes listdocker compose run -e 'OWL_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME' -e 'OWL_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD' owl mezmo logindocker compose run -e 'OWL_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID' owl mezmo download_users```### Option 3: Directly You can leverage the available [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions) file to install requirements with [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com).```bashasdf install```Alternatively you can install the required Node, Elixir and Erlang version manually based on the version of the [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions) file.Run it with:```bashmix run lib/cli.exs ```## How does it work?OpenOwl signs in like a regular user by entering username and password (RPA via Playwright). It then uses the SaaS' internal APIs to request the list of users on your behalf.This approach only works for SaaS applications with internal APIs. With the rise of single page apps (SPA) (think about React.js, Vue etc.), most applications can be supported. Besides SaaS applications this tool can also be used for internal apps.## Quick Demo## Known limitations1. User Account: The user account needs administrator rights (or a similar permissions that grants access to user lists).2. Login: Currently only direct logins via username and password are supported. Logins via SSO (Google, Okta, Onelogin,...) will be added in the future.3. Captchas: Login flows that include captchas are currently not supported.## How to contribute[Here](recipes.yml) is the list of available integrations. Open a PR to add further [recipes](recipes.yml), adjust existing ones or extend missing capabilities (like further pagination strategies) to support even more applications.When all the required capabilities exist, a further integration can take just 30m.### How to add a new vendor recipe1. Check that your intended SaaS application has an internal API.  1. Open the Developer Tools/Inspector of your favourite browser.  1. Navigate to the page that shows all users.  1. In your inspector filter by XHR requests and reload the page. When you find some that belong to the same domain like your tool, the application is probably supported.1. Use the Network tab in the inspector, find the request that includes your list of users with their permissions.1. Copy the request as `curl`-request and paste it into a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). You can import the request by clicking *Import*, selecting *Raw text* and pasting the copied `curl`-request.1. Execute the request in Postman and remove as many headers and parameters as possible to keep the request clean. Check that the request still works. Add the request to the [`recipes.yml`](recipes.yml).1. When you have many users in your SaaS account, you will not see all users at once but 10, 50 or 100. Adjust the pagination parameters and try to get all data by traversing through it. Check which [pagination strategy](lib/pagination_strategies/) applies and add it to your added recipe.1. Open the direct login page of the new vendor and find the right [selector](https://www.cuketest.com/playwright/docs/selectors) for the username and password field. Adjust the [`recipes.yml`](recipes.yml) accordingly.1. Test that the login flow works properly and the configured action.1. Open a PR.## Troubleshooting### Build Docker imageIn case the Shell Wrapper cannot build the Docker image as expected, try the following command to build the image manually:```bashdocker build -t open_owl-owl:latest .```## The history of OpenOwlKnowing who has access to your SaaS tools is often guesswork at best and manually adding and deleting user accounts is tedious and error prone. The fact that SCIM/SAML are often locked up behind an enterprise-subscription is adding to the frustration. That's why Mathias and Philip decided to build [AccessOwl](https://www.accessowl.io/), a tool to automate SaaS account provisioning for employees for any tool.OpenOwl is essentially an open-source version of the underlying technology of AccessOwl. It was created out of a discussion that having access to your own teams user data should be a basic right for anybody. No matter whether it's used for audits, to discover orphaned user accounts or run access reviews. That's why we decided to open source a core part of AccessOwl to let anybody read out crucial information out of their SaaS stack.",

While users are calling for clarification on its SSO, OpenOwl was built with ease of use in mind, allowing it to be used by non-developer IT admins. Users suggest combining multiple distinct problems, such as the \"SSO is expensive\" problem, the \"access user data\" problem, \"centrally manage permissions\" problem, and \"automatic account provisioning/deprovisioning\" problem, which OpenOwl aims to support. Future versions are set to offer secure login flow solutions, including enabling Google SSO sign-in with 2FA enabled, making it more attractive to all users.A new tool called Resmo aims to reduce the Single Sign-On (SSO) tax that is usually bundled with third-party SSO, SCIM and SAML. Resmo integrates with 80+ of the most popular tools, and only three of them require the paid-tier for API access. A Resmo user can list and manage the users and their permissions centrally in one place, and they can quickly find the data they require by utilizing the SQL command. While small businesses are increasingly using SSO, many software solutions are still charging way too much money as \"enterprise\" pricing, effectively holding security hostage. Resmo's solution to this issue is providing an affordable tool for both small and large businesses.The cost of SSO is often unfairly high due to enterprise plans with added features, resulting in a significant price increase for those who only want SSO. SaaS vendors often do not include prices on their website as software integration typically requires consulting and bespoke development. While SSO is orders of magnitude easier to implement and enforces better security practices, many customers do not enjoy implementing it as a policy. The cost of SSO is often subsidized by commercial customers, and adding necessary features can cause a significant increase in the price of the service.",

Today\u2019s landslide 44-16 vote on the reconciled bill in the House follows a successful vote in the Senate last month. The bill now moves to the governor\u2019s desk.We\u2019ve been raising the alarm and advocating for farmers for a decade. In the meantime, Deere and other major agricultural equipment manufacturers have worked ever harder to keep their repair monopolies, consolidating independent repair shops into larger and larger dealerships. This has left farmers with few options when it comes to fixing their equipment.Colorado is already a leader in the Right to Repair movement. Last year, they passed the first US Right to Repair bill since 2012, protecting Coloradans\u2019 right to fix their own powered wheelchairs. Colorado\u2019s fight for the Right to Repair is being waged by a broad coalition of groups, including Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, and CoPIRG.In January\u2014the beginning of the legislative season\u2014Deere and the American Farm Bureau Federation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), promising to give farmers access to some previously restricted repair materials. And on the very day of a critical hearing, Case IH and New Holland signed their own memorandum of understanding at the last minute, a desperate attempt to smother the bill. However, legislators determined that both MOUs were vague, incomplete, and unenforceable. Suspiciously, they also required that members of the American Farm Bureau Federation cease advocating for Right to Repair laws.\u00a0But other farm groups in Colorado and beyond have continued to advocate on behalf of all farmers. Montana Farmers Union president Walter Schweitzer told PIRG, We could have a dozen pinky swears from a dozen tractor manufacturers, but we still wouldn\u2019t have comprehensive repair materials. I\u2019m running out of pinkies and I still can\u2019t fix my damn tractor.\u00a0\u2014WALTER SCHWEITZER, Montana Farmers Union President Farmers have found that any repair that interfaces with the emissions control system on the tractor is likely to require a dealer mechanic to input a code to complete. And in many states, dealer mechanics are increasingly overburdened, as Deere has killed off smaller repair businesses. A PIRG investigation of agricultural repair market consolidation found that last year in Colorado, there were 1,437 farms per Deere dealership. No wonder farmers reported waiting as much as 8 weeks for repair service\u2014an unacceptable delay when your crops are rotting in the field.But even before this bill passed, the antitrust screws have been tightening: The US Department of Justice weighed in on a large class action lawsuit criticizing Deere\u2019s monopolistic practices. Last year, Farm Action and other farm advocacy groups filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission. Repair.org and PIRG advocates believe there\u2019s irony in Deere\u2019s argument that their repair restrictions are meant to follow the Clean Air Act\u2014because Deere may be violating that very law by refusing to allow third-party repair.\u00a0Meanwhile, hackers have been looking for ways around these restrictions. Last year at the hacker conference DefCon, security researcher Sick Codes demonstrated that he was able to get Doom running on a Deere console.\u00a0Still, none of this movement against Deere has had the force of law. When the bill goes into effect on January 1, 2025, Colorado farmers will get the first chance to experience a post-monopoly world.Today\u2019s bill passage should open the door for more independent repair options for farmers: Farmers, their hired mechanics, and local repair shops can get the parts, diagnostics, and documentation they need to make repairs.One critical step remains: a signature by Governor Polis, who has signaled that he supports the legislation.\u201cFor farmers, simply getting access to all the tools needed to fix their tractors has been a tough row to hoe. That makes this historic victory sweeter than summer corn,\u201d said PIRG Right to Repair Campaign Director Kevin O\u2019Reilly. \u201cWith this bill, Colorado legislators are giving their farmers the repair relief they deserve. But farmers across the country should know: This is just the start.\u201d\u201cEveryone who eats will benefit from this law. Farmers will have more timely options for repair, which will make it easier to use high-tech products which in turn enable more productive farms,\u201d said Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org. \u201cIt will also help align the industry of agriculture with other products using technology-enabled products such as motor vehicles, trucks, wheelchairs, and cell phones. We should all be able to fix everything, everywhere, all the time.\u201d\u201cThis is a huge win for farmers in Colorado, who will now have more control over their own equipment and the ability to fix it themselves,\u201d said Kyle Wiens, iFixit CEO. \u201ciFixit has been fighting for our right to fix every thing we own for two decades. We\u2019re thrilled to see this right extended to farmers in Colorado, and we expect that other states will follow suit.\u201dTo support Right to Repair legislation near you, find your state on Repair.org\u2014or, if you\u2019re outside the US, look for your country\u2019s advocacy network here.Related StoriesRight to RepairDeere Promised Farmers the Right to Repair.

When your combine breaks during harvest, you can't just grab another or wait a couple of days for the repair guy to show up -- you need it fixed now. That's not easy.Not to mention, understanding your soil, your crops, the weather, how they interact, how to handle everything from planting up to post-harvest processing... it's not an easy job.And this starts at a young age, because all the kids help out on the farm, too.

A modern farmer is an engineer, an economist, a biologist and a wilderness expert all in one. reply  voakbasda 1 hour ago        | prev | next [\u2013] I suspect that John Deere and friends will find a way to challenge this in court and -- if they eventually lose -- find a way to maliciously comply with the law. Their behavior has been actively hostile to their customers for years, and they have zero incentive to change.Like Apple's repair kits mentioned in another comment, I suspect their strategy will involve providing tools that cost nearly as much to rent as it would take to buy a new machine. Then, only the most well-capitalized farmers will be able to afford to lock up the extraordinary amounts of cash required to perform their own repairs.Without legislation that absolutely eviscerates their monopolistic business practices, I would be shocked if anything changes for the average farmer. reply  userbinator 1 hour ago        | parent | next [\u2013] Like Apple's repair kits mentioned in another comment, I suspect their strategy will involve providing tools that cost nearly as much to rent as it would take to buy a new machine.That reminds me of how much things have changed since the \"good old days\".

Agriculture, at least in the US, is primarily a government subsidized big business. Many if not most John Deere customers are corporations that like having their operating fleets be maintained and managed with help from the provider. The farmers getting screwed are smaller operators who are far less profitable for John Deere and really should seek or develop other options if at all possible.Comparisons with Apple hardware are not very good because Apple is primarily a consumer brand. Apple does in a sense sell fleets to companies and schools, but most rely on other companies to configure and maintain their computing gear.

    "hn_summary": "Colorado's agricultural right to repair has been passed, with optimism for approval from Governor Polis, but uncertain success. Farmers claim the technology corporations such as John Deere company actively hold hostile monopolistic business practices, deterring from repair and conflicting with the needs of farmers who cannot wait for parts or new equipment during harvest season. Some suggest that a company like Massey, Fendt or similar could have an opportunity to differentiate themselves by supporting repairs, filling the need for explicit signals of available online manuals and software to support repairs."

Experts note the absence of a clear definition of \"commercial activity,\" which may lead to unintended consequences for developers. Some suggest that selling support for open-source software may be considered a commercial activity, while others disagree. Despite the controversy, open-source developers who do not monetize their software are likely to be exempt from this regulation. The EU is expected to release a new draft of the regulation in April, based on feedback from open-source foundations.The European Union's Article 13 will require open-source codes' creators to be financially responsible for commercial software it is used in; Law excludes paid open-source contributors. This may cause developers to leave the EU, and destroy the open-source community as we know it. If enforced retroactively, commercial developers  could hold open source contributors responsible \u2013 including Bill Joy for creating the first versions of TCP/IP stack- causing an unsolvable legal conundrum. While the regulation is necessary, writing effective and targeted regulations is hard, and the current draft may be not in the right place. Extraterritoriality and the way EU data processing protection rules apply to people outside of the EU is still unknown, making it hard for developers to comply with privacy laws.The EU proposed legislation that would require open-source maintainers to perform audits, require certification, and handle liability; This has raised concerns among the open-source community as it may make them financially and legally liable for the code they write; Some small shops have already refused to work with EU IP addresses and redirected to a page with a disclaimer; Large corporations have already benefited from GDPR, and it may not be surprising if they start exploiting these new regulations as well; Instead of targeting open-source maintainers, liability should be shifted to the company shipping the actual product; This approach to regulation is strongly disconnected from the way software is currently built, and maintainers need to pay more attention to this space.The EU is proposing a law that may hold developers liable for problems in their software, which has caused concern among FOSS developers. Americans commenters argue that similar regulations exist in the US, and such laws can create new liability even when disclaimers exist. The proposed law only applies to commercial activity, but some open source projects might not qualify. The views on this law are divisive, with some believing it would shield customers from poorly designed products, while\u00a0others argue\u00a0it will prevent small developers from creating new products. Total downloads of Python software every day exceeding 300 million times since companies and developers have integrated Python into their products directly, relying on the software.A discussion on the pros and cons of open-source software arose on Hacker News.

One user mentioned that the IoT industry shows us that charging for software doesn't necessarily make it less vulnerable. Open-source proponents argue that deferring semantics to implementation provides a convenient and bug-free option. However, the user points out that the code may not be suitable for all purposes, and it's up to the user to be responsible for what they use it for.",

The punishment came 10 months after a jury found her guilty on four counts of fraud and conspiracy against the Thearanos investors who believed in her promises to revolutionize the health care industry.Holmes had accompanied her lawyers to a San Jose, California, courtroom on March 17 to try to convince Davila that various missteps by federal prosecutors and the omission of key evidence will culminate in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals exonerating her.Her prison sentence is scheduled to start roughly 20 years after Holmes dropped out of Stanford University when she was 19 years old to start Theranos in Palo Alto, California \u2013 the same city where William Hewlett and David Packard founded a company bearing their surnames in a small garage and planted the seeds of what grew into Silicon Valley.Holmes could still file another appeal of the ruling Davila's latest ruling, a maneuver that her co-conspirator at Theranos \u2013 Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani \u2013 successfully used to delay his scheduled March 16 date to begin a nearly 13-year prison sentence. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last week rejected that appeal, and Balwani is now scheduled to report to a Southern California prison on April 20.Davila has recommended that Holmes serve her sentence in a Byron, Texas, prison. It hasn't yet been publicly confirmed if that will be the facility where she reports.Unless she can find a way to stay free, Holmes will be separated from the two children she had leading up to the trial and after her conviction.Her first child, a boy, was born shortly before her trial began in September 2021. The youngest child, whose gender hasn't been disclosed in court documents, was born at some point after her November sentencing. She conceived both with her current partner, William \"Billy\" Evans, who she met after breaking up with Balwani in the midst of Theranos' scandalous downfall.The denial of Holmes' request to remain free is the latest twist in a long-running saga that has already been the subject of an acclaimed HBO documentary and an award-winning Hulu TV series.Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos' blood-testing system as a breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors and at one point anointed Holmes with a $4.5 billion fortune, based on her 50% stake in Theranos.Holmes also parlayed the buzz surrounding Theranos to speaking engagements on the same stage as former President Bill Clinton and glowing cover stories in business publication that likened her to tech visionaries such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.But Theranos' technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in the company's scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Readers also question why Holmes was punished for financial fraud rather than the impact of faulty test results on patient health.A discussion on Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) feature highlights the discrepancy between the marketing name and the technical functionality that it represents. Some users assert that selling something called FSD that doesn't fully drive itself is not within the duty of good faith and fair dealing, while others argue that FSD is just an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) level 2, like many other car brands. The FSD Beta program, tested by thousands of users, causes controversy, with some users labeling it as reckless and unethical, while others believe it is a safer alternative to novice drivers. The discussion touches on the subject of ethics, morals, and regulation, and the need for independent audits and formalized safety testing processes for autonomous systems.The article discusses whether self-driving technology has advanced to the point of being relatively immune to government intervention and oversight. One commentator argues that compromise is the only sensible approach when considering the potential benefits to society. However, another commentator raises concerns about the safety of such technology and claims that Tesla is \"hyping\" self-driving capabilities that it doesn't currently possess. Twitter's API changes are also discussed, with critics expressing their dissatisfaction over the suddenness of the transition. The discussion underscores the complex balance between innovation, safety, and the responsibilities of tech companies towards their customers.A culture that supresses internal doubt and creates delusional over-promising could lead to prosecution. The debate sparked mainly revolves around Musk's culpability or special treatment as he faces minimum sanction, whilst other defendants that commit less serious crimes receive much longer sentences. The debate reaches beyond fraudulent activity and extends to the disproportionate punishment laws. The post highlights that only a dishonest person will steal from the rich, while the elites use their network to escape prosecution. There is minimal good conduct time, systematic parole eligibility, and early release in the federal prison system.Elizabeth Holmes, former CEO of Theranos, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after defrauding investors, doctors, and patients in a blood-testing scandal. An HN user points out that Holmes won't qualify for California's \"three strikes\" law, which requires three grand theft convictions before a 25-year minimum sentence is imposed. While Holmes didn't steal $5k more than three times, she still stole millions, leading some to question the justice system's perverse incentives. The article also highlights the normalized nature of theft in the Bay Area, while another user wonders if Holmes will actually report to prison.Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for several counts of fraud. Holmes was also fined $500,000 and required to pay restitution. Despite her lawyers' attempts to argue for a lighter sentence, citing her lack of previous criminal history and charitable work, the judge ruled that her actions had significant impacts on public health and research. Holmes' former partner, Sunny Balwani, who faced the same charges, will be sentenced separately. Many users on Hacker News speculated about whether Holmes would attempt to flee or whether she would serve her sentence in \"minimum security\" prison.The discussion on HN revolves around the sentencing of Elizabeth Holmes and the appropriateness of prison sentences for non-violent crimes. Some users argue that white-collar crimes like fraud harm society in unique ways, destroying trust and leading to long-term impacts, while others believe that the costs of incarceration are too high and a free person can pay their debt to society with money. An ankle monitor system is suggested as an alternative, while others note that Holmes's crimes directly jeopardized people's health. However, some think that people have a tendency to be forgiving towards non-violent crimes and that they need to be punished for their criminal actions, including any resulting harm like the death of patients.HN users comment on possible punishments for fraudulent loan applications, suggesting fines are often insufficient and other deterrents can be explored, such as bans on equity ownership. One user contends that the current prison system's approach to punishment is barbaric and suggests alternative measures like caning, banishment, or compulsory face tattoos of shame. The comment section raises questions about the effectiveness of current punishments and highlights possibilities for more creative approaches.",
    "hn_summary": "Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, has failed to avoid a 20-year prison sentence for fraud. Contrasting opinions and criticisms of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and self-driving in general are discussed, including the need for independent audits and regulations. The discussion revolved around the appropriateness and effectiveness of prison sentences for non-violent crimes, highlighting alternatives such as ankle monitoring systems, equity ownership bans, and more creative punishments."

    "hn_content": "An HN post asks if the job market is brutal, with examples given of high-experience tech workers struggling to find work. One user suggests trying defense companies. Some users argue that working for defense companies raises moral and ethical concerns, while others argue that it is a necessary industry. Other users suggest that non-tech Fortune 100 companies may offer fewer hours and lower stress. Applicants may face high volume competition, leading to generic rejection letters.Prospective tech employees should consider factors beyond job pay, such as onerous bureaucracy and office environment, according to employment comments on Hacker News. A significant and competitive pool of underneath-and above-average talent exists at non-tech companies. The job search process for senior roles is lengthier and more challenging, regardless of experience. The influx of candidates has slowed recruiters' ability to screen and interview appropriately. Recruiters may avoid notifying qualified candidates of positions for fear of being poached by FAANG companies. Employers have regained power in the market and job prospects may continue to be bleak for the time being.Experienced tech professionals are struggling to find work despite their qualifications and track record, with some unable to secure employment after months of searching. Specialization is viewed as career suicide, as most companies look for employees with interdisciplinary skills. Those at FAANG level may struggle to find roles with equivalent high salaries in smaller organizations, particularly if they lack expertise in specific areas of software development. Hiring managers themselves are finding the process challenging, with some struggling to find candidates who can solve basic coding problems. Some suggest that candidates should be expected to successfully complete such exercises, while others find them insulting.Many candidates struggle with coding, as it's a common requirement for job interviews. Some companies use coding questions to test adaptability more than the candidate's coding skills. Artificial intelligence is entering the conversation, with discussion around ChatGPT's abilities compared with human candidates. There is a high number of applicants per week for software engineer roles, making it challenging to stand out from the crowd. Some companies are delaying hiring decisions and are looking to fill senior or management roles. Freelance or consulting work may be an option for those struggling to find a job. The current job climate is tough, and it requires a lot of motivation to stay focused and confident during a job search.Recruiting in the tech industry has slowed down, particularly for middle management roles. While senior individual contributors (ICs) are still in demand, companies are cutting middle managers. The drop in demand can be felt especially in the Bay Area among FAANG companies. Large non-tech companies and government agencies like Walmart, CVS and UnitedHealth are still hiring; but beware of ghost job openings where companies stockpile resumes for future use without any intention of hiring right now. Job seekers are finding it harder to land roles and many workers are wondering if the past decade has been a wasted opportunity for some sort of collective bargaining or a greater seat at the table of businesses. Location is considered irrelevant for most forms of knowledge work, particularly since the pandemic has pushed remote work to the forefront.The current job market for tech professionals is soft, although some industries like energy are hiring. Many experienced engineers are receiving less responses to job applications, and companies are rejecting more qualified applicants. The hiring process is often inefficient, particularly at small companies that are unable to manage the process well. Those with twenty years of experience or a \"big-name\" company on their resume often find it difficult to secure interviews. However, smaller companies in fields like banking, manufacturing, and pharma are hiring swiftly. Some have suggested that relocating abroad to countries like Germany may offer better job opportunities.Advice and discussion on job searching in the tech industry, with an emphasis on customizing resumes and cover letters for specific positions rather than sending out generic applications en masse. Some comments suggest the market for senior/lead level roles in the EU is tough, while others argue that salaries are still going up. There is also discussion of the limited opportunities for tech workers to audit software for safety/privacy compliancy and the need for tech workers to be more assertive in protecting their position in the industry. A suggestion is made to consider building a startup during the current job market lull.",

It provides a legal foundationfor the movement and organizes activism around software freedom. The GNUproject, closely related, has its own long story in our movement as the codingarm of the Free Software Foundation, taking these principles and philosophy intopractice by developing free software; notably the GNU operating system thatfamously rests atop GNU/Linux.Today, almost 40 years on, the FSF is dying.Their achievements are unmistakable: we must offer them our gratitude andadmiration for decades of accomplishments in establishing and advancing ourcause. The principles of software freedom are more important than ever, and theproducts of these institutions remain necessary and useful \u2013 the GPL licensefamily, GCC, GNU coreutils, and so on. Nevertheless, the organizations behindthis work are floundering.The Free Software Foundation must concern itself with the following ahead of allelse:Disseminating free software philosophyDeveloping, publishing, and promoting copyleft licensesOverseeing the health of the free software movementIt is failing in each of these regards, and as its core mission fails, thefoundation is investing its resources into distractions.In its role as the thought-leaders of free software philosophy, the message ofthe FSF has a narrow reach. The organization\u2019s messaging is tone-deaf,ineffective, and myopic. Hammering on about \u201cGNU/Linux\u201d nomenclature, antagonismtowards our allies in the open source movement, maligning the audience as\u201cuseds\u201d rather than \u201cusers\u201d; none of this aids the cause. The pages and pages ofdense philosophical essays and poorly organized FAQs do not provide a usefulentry point or reference for the community. The message cannot spread like this.As for copyleft, well, it\u2019s no coincidence that many people struggle with theFSF\u2019s approach. Do you, dear reader, know the difference between free softwareand copyleft? Many people assume that the MIT license is not free softwarebecause it\u2019s not viral. The GPL family of licenses are essential for ourmovement, but few people understand its dense and esoteric language, despite the16,000-word FAQ which supplements it. And hip new software isn\u2019t using copyleft:over 1 million npm packages use a permissive license while fewer than 20,000 usethe GPL; cargo sports a half-million permissive packages and another 20,000 orso GPL\u2019d.And is the free software movement healthy? This one gets an emphatic \u201cyes!\u201d \u2013thanks to the open source movement and the near-equivalence between freesoftware and open source software. There\u2019s more free software than ever andvirtually all new software contains free software components, and most peoplecall it open source.The FOSS community is now dominated by people who are beyond the reach of theFSF\u2019s message. The broader community is enjoying a growth in the diversity ofbackgrounds and values represented, and the message does not reach these people.The FSF fails to understand its place in the world as a whole, or itsrelationship to the progressive movements taking place in the ecosystem andbeyond. The foundation does not reach out to new leaders in the community,leaving them to form insular, weak institutions among themselves with no centralleadership, and leaving us vulnerable to exploitation from growing movementslike open core and commercial attacks on the free and open source softwarebrand.Reforms are sorely needed for the FSF to fulfill it basic mission. Inparticular, I call for the following changes:Reform the leadership. It\u2019s time for Richard Stallman to go. His polemeicrhetoric rivals even my own, and the demographics he represents \u2013 to theexclusion of all others \u2013 is becoming a minority within the free softwaremovement. We need more leaders of color, women, LGBTQ representation, andothers besides. The present leadership, particularly from RMS, creates anexclusionary environment in a place where inclusion and representation areimportant for the success of the movement.Reform the institution. The FSF needs to correct its myopic view of theecosystem, reach out to emerging leaders throughout the FOSS world, and askthem to take charge of the FSF\u2019s mission. It\u2019s these leaders who hold thereins of the free software movement today \u2013 not the FSF. If the FSF stillwants to be involved in the movement, they need to recognize and empower theleaders who are pushing the cause forward.Reform the message. People depend on the FSF to establish a strongbackground in free software philosophy and practices within the community,and the FSF is not providing this. The message needs to be made much moreaccessible and level in tone, and the relationship between free software andopen source needs to be reformed so that the FSF and OSI stand together asthe pillars at the foundations of our ecosystem.Decouple the FSF from the GNU project. FSF and GNU have workedhand-in-hand over decades to build the movement from scratch, but theirprivileged relationship has become obsolete. The GNU project represents aminute fraction of the free software ecosystem today, and it\u2019s necessary forthe Free Software Foundation to stand independently of any particular projectand focus on the health of the ecosystem as a whole.Develop new copyleft licenses. The GPL family of licenses has served uswell, but we need to do better. The best copyleft license today is theMPL, whose terse form and accessible language outperforms the GPL inmany respects. However, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to theneeds of copyleft, and new licenses are required to fill other niches in themarket \u2013 the FSF should write these licenses. Furthermore, the FSF shouldpresent the community with a free software perspective on licenses as aresource that project leaders can depend on to understand the importance oftheir licensing choice such that they understand the appeal of copyleftlicenses without feeling pushed away from permissive approaches.The free software movement needs a strong force uniting it: we face challengesfrom many sides, and today\u2019s Free Software Foundation is not equal to the task.The FOSS ecosystem is flourishing, and it\u2019s time for the FSF to step up to thewheel and direct its coming successes in the name of software freedom.

    "hn_content": "The Free Software Foundation is reportedly dying, with comments suggesting that Richard Stallman, its founder, should step down for the organisation to move forward; however, others counter that it was Stallman who spearheaded the philosophy of open-source software and its related movement. While it is noted that Stallman has not been 'relevant' for decades, many still see him as an essential figurehead for the Free Software Foundation. Some comments suggest his greatest achievement was the founding of this organisation, while criticism is levelled at Stallman's recent lack of action or innovation. Nonetheless, many see him as better suited to a consulting role that would allow him to remain active in the organization.HN users discuss the problem of secure boot in implementing Linux on Intel laptops. Some argue for the need for a chain of trust, while others argue that users should be allowed to choose the chain of trust. The FSF's relevance and activism are also questioned, while the need for open-source software for democracy and freedom is emphasized. There are examples of Intel laptops blocking Linux installation, but it is possible to enable it through the BIOS setting, so it is not clear if Intel is actively blocking it. Richard Stallman's future and role in the movement is also a topic of discussion.A discussion on Foundation Structures and their relevance to corporate involvement and exploitation was had on HN. The conversation discussed examples of where corporations have worked together with foundations effectively and examples of where it has turned negative. The Linux Foundation was cited as a good example of where the structure balances private and corporate interests well. A discussion on diversity and including LGBTQ, women, and People of Colour in leadership positions also took place. To achieve effective leadership, it was thought that leadership should have technical and social competency with a vision aligned to core FSF ideologies. Additionally, technologists are encouraged to use seemingly unrelated issues such as human governance and society to draw connections between those and software freedom.The FSF may be dying due to its resistance to change and toxic work environment, driving away talented individuals. The organization's goals have not entirely been achieved, and the landscape has changed since its inception. There is a need for a new kind of freedom that the FSF may not be able to deliver, and new leadership based on skill, respect, and vision is needed. The idea that diversity should be a goal is dangerous and discriminative, and the focus must be on fighting discrimination. Those aiming for free software's success can either reform the FSF or create a new organization, but the use of the FSF's brand and established network of donors is not necessarily a bad thing.  The focus must be on achieving the organization's goals, and change is required for growth.The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has become stagnant under Richard Stallman's management, and some are calling for him to step down, although he has staunch supporters. The FSF has remained selectively focused on licensing violations of the GNU project instead of all GPL-licensed projects; innovation in licensing is needed to solve this problem. Despite the growing popularity of \"Open Source,\" especially on Github, the FSF continues to be relevant in guiding the open-source community, even if it is not necessarily driving it forward. There are opportunities for new leaders in the community, but this must prioritize merit, not representation.The article argues that the Free Software Foundation (FSF) needs to focus on making FOSS a more reasonable option for end-users, as opposed to focusing on the developer side, which has already been done. The average user, who runs Windows and has an iPhone or Android, deals with far simpler and more dystopian problems than FOSS. The FSF's insistence on total replacement of workflows is impractical for most people. Instead, FOSS successes come when a project bridges the user problem. Criticisms of FSF, stemming from its philosophical essays and poorly organized FAQs, do not facilitate the cause. However, critics must first understand FSF's perspective before abandons the cause.The community is divided over the Free Software Foundation\u2019s approach to copyleft. The article suggests it is time for Richard Stallman to go, but HN users argue that Stallman\u2019s contribution to the software development ecosystem should not be discredited. The majority's recent focus towards closed-source commercial software, no longer under the FOSS movement, is concerning.

Some argue that the FSF is agenda-driven, while others feel following their guidelines ironically leaves the user with very little freedom.",
