    "hn_content": "The post discusses various techniques for defending against brute-force attacks and other hacking attempts. Some contributors share their own experiences of defending against attacks on their servers, while others offer advice on how to minimize the risk of attack in the first place. Topics discussed include using fail2ban, disabling password authentication, running SSH on a non-standard port, and sending redirects to large files to overload attackers. There is also some discussion of using tarpits like endlessh to discourage attackers. The post is aimed at entry-level software engineers and others who are new to the field and would benefit from learning more about basic security measures.The article is a discussion among users on a tech forum about the risks of allowing password-based login on SSH servers. Some users suggest disabling password authentication altogether and using only SSH public keys, while others suggest adding additional security measures like fail2ban or using firewalls to block traffic from certain regions or IP addresses. Other users propose more elaborate solutions, such as using SSH agent forwarding, wireguard interfaces, or port-knocking. While the discussion is light-hearted and sometimes sarcastic, it underscores the importance of using robust security measures to protect against brute-force attacks on SSH servers.A website displays a live feed of attempted logins to common internet services to raise awareness of the prevalence of brute force attacks. The website only displays attempts from known malicious sources and logs no legitimate traffic. The attack targets are HTTP/HTTPS basic auth, FTP/FTPS, LDAP, SSH, and a few other protocols and anyone involved in security work or wanting to verify how common such unsophisticated attacks are might find the feed of interest. While the website has caused controversy, it is a valuable resource for those interested in security and keeping up to date with the latest threats. Other developers are utilizing similar solutions such as IPBan.- Fail2ban may not actually prevent brute force attacks, but it can conserve server resources by stopping responses to such attacks.\n- Using cryptographic keys instead of passwords and implementing Role-Based Access Control are better alternatives to prevent attacks.\n- Real-time honeypots and open-source tools such as IPython Notebook can be used to monitor and protect servers.\n- The website \"brute.fail\" streams live data showing attempts to log into three SSH-enabled servers. It does not reveal the server's IP address or count failed attempts.\n- The website can be easily vandalized, so users should exercise caution before attempting to interact with it.\n- One user suggests trying all 2^32 IPv4 addresses with a specific password to find the location of the server. \n- The website's purpose is to illustrate how brute force attacks work, rather than to report actual failed login attempts. \n- The website may potentially be used as a chat service and has gained attention from the Hacker News community.",

    "hn_content": "California spent $17 billion on homelessness, but it's not working. The \"housing first\" strategy has been proven to work in Finland, but it has been implemented poorly in San Francisco. Housing is expensive, and California has more homeless people than Finland ever did. The homeless-industrial complex of non-profits in SF is huge but using a lottery system is not a real solution. Resettlement somewhere cheaper is the sensible thing to do, but it requires relocation, which doesn't scale. Homelessness is not just a financial problem; it's multifaceted and also includes mental health and addiction issues. A housing-first program would work, but it's politically infeasible and some people believe homeless people should not be given free housing.The issue of homelessness in high-cost areas like San Francisco is politically fraught. There are voluntary programs to transport homeless people to cheaper areas, but forcibly relocating them is considered inhumane. Ensuring relocated individuals\u2019 needs are met and providing clean, well-maintained housing is a challenge. Homelessness is often linked to drug addiction and mental health issues. There\u2019s resistance to forcing people into psychiatric care or drug treatment, but it shouldn't be a requirement for receiving housing. Making homelessness illegal could be a solution, provided a good alternative is provided for every person affected. The problem isn't just one of rising rents - addiction and mental illness often play roles. Focusing only on helping violent law-breaking, drug-addicted homeless people and ignoring apparently less obvious forms of homelessness will not help.There is no meaningful content for a tech-savvy audience in this post.Discussed the causes of homelessness in the US, including lack of affordable housing, mental illness, addiction, and medical expenses. Debate around whether wage growth or lack of affordable housing is a bigger issue. Various ideas proposed for solutions, including housing first with support, job programs, mandatory treatment in prison, and changing zoning laws. Debate around rent control and its effectiveness in solving homelessness. Mention of a Finnish program offering permanent housing with a live-in social worker. Some disagreement about whether moving out of expensive cities is a viable solution for everyone. Point made that simply making more housing available, without considering the demographics and diversity of the housing, is not enough. Discussion around the challenges of prosecuting petty crimes as a solution to homelessness.Comments on a thread discussing homelessness and how to solve the problem. \n\n- Homelessness is not just a problem in SF or LA, but in many cities across the country.\n- Jailing homeless people is not a solution as it creates a revolving door.\n- Trying to solve a national problem on a state level is bound to fail.\n- The opioid epidemic is a significant contributor to the homeless crisis.\n- People in the rust belt have as many issues with drugs and crime, but they have homes.\n- When a city becomes too dense or expensive, homelessness starts becoming a problem.\n- Providing housing is the cheapest solution to homelessness.\n- People who are homeless due to disabilities should not be required to work in exchange for housing.\n- The idea of worrying about who gets what for free before solving the problem is hindering progress.\n- Homeowners already benefit from massive government subsidies and handouts, such as capital gains tax exemptions and mortgage interest deductions.A discussion thread on housing and homelessness on an unspecified platform includes various arguments and opinions. Some mention the benefits of \"housing first\" programs, such as the success it has had in Finland and how it can mitigate problems like substance abuse, violent crime, and healthcare costs. Others argue about the potential negative effects, such as the fear of public housing projects being detrimental to society. The discussion also touches on why people do not take advantage of purchasing affordable mobile homes and the issue of \"free housing\" being taken advantage of. Further discussions include the need for the federal government to get involved to solve the issue, the impact of mental illness and drug addiction on homelessness, and criticisms on the lack of affordable housing and housing assistance programs.The post discusses the relationship between accepting refugees/immigrants and providing public welfare/healthcare programs. The US accepted about 22,645 refugees in 2022, and Finland accepted about 1,282. Canada is mentioned as having a higher percentage of its population being immigrants and a more comprehensive welfare state than the US. The discussion turns to the issue of homelessness, with varying opinions on whether or not free housing should be provided to those struggling with housing insecurity, including drug addicts. The post argues that it is not sustainable to have a welfare state and a liberal immigration policy simultaneously, with some disagreeing on this claim. Finally, Canada's immigration policy and housing crisis are discussed, with differing opinions on the effectiveness and replicability of Canada's policies.A discussion on homelessness in San Francisco reveals differing views on the root causes of the issue, with some advocating for a direct approach targeting addiction while others insist that more affordable housing is the key solution. Critics of the housing-first approach argue that such a strategy misses the fact that homelessness is itself a symptom of larger problems of societal neglect and a lack of government accountability. Meanwhile, proponents of a more interventionist approach may argue that incentivizing homelessness only encourages an influx of transients to the area, exacerbating the problem. Ultimately, there appears to be no easy answer to the issue, and the debate surrounding it has deep political and philosophical implications.While homeless populations don't tend to move to different cities specifically for homelessness, people in unstable living situations may be lured by a job or housing offer in a new city, such as Vancouver. However, stability in such cities is difficult to maintain without significant earning power as they have a high cost of living. Those without highly valued job skills may be better off moving to smaller, less expensive towns in BC. There is a discrepancy in the data and anecdotal beliefs about where some homeless people come from, with some municipalities being unwilling to provide resources for relocation. Homelessness is less visible in colder climates, and while forced detox and compulsory treatment methods may not be effective, providing housing can help address the problem. However, mentally unstable people may struggle to maintain supportive housing.The post discusses the complex issue of addressing homelessness and mental illness. There are varying opinions on how to solve this problem, including incarceration in mental institutions or drug rehab facilities. However, past attempts at these solutions have often failed. Giving unconditional cash grants is also debated, as some argue that the money may be spent on drugs or exacerbate the problem. The root issue is the high cost of housing in California. However, the article is specifically focused on one encampment and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the broader issue or the allocation of the $17B budget for homelessness in California.The post contains comments and discussions on the issue of homelessness and addiction in the US. Some comments suggest that giving drug addicts money might not be the best solution to address the root cause of addiction. There are concerns that homeless people with addiction issues might use the money to fuel their habits. There are also discussions about the demographics of the homeless population and the need for supportive services to help them get back on track. Some comments suggest that more resources should be allocated to help people without substance abuse problems as they respond better to support programs. It is crucial to have separate programs for each group.- 1 in 9 homeless people in California are out-of-staters\n- Homeless people tend to gravitate towards areas where sleeping rough is easier\n- There is no good solution for people with mental health issues in homelessness\n- Giving money to people trapped in the cycle of addiction won't necessarily break that cycle, they need treatment and integration programs\n- The current system benefits people making money from it \n- Society does not necessarily want to hug homeless people or hire them",
    "hn_summary": "- California spent $17 billion on homelessness, but it's not working, with the \"housing first\" strategy not being implemented effectively in San Francisco, despite its success in Finland.\n- Homelessness is multifaceted, involving mental health and addiction issues, making the provision of clean, well-maintained housing a challenge.\n- Debate centers around whether to provide free housing, with concerns about fear of public housing and \"free housing\" being taken advantage of, and also whether to focus on affordable housing or addiction intervention as a solution."

It\u2019s also a colossally active hub for the discussion of video games, a place where millions of gamers gather every day in communities devoted to everything from retro classics to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. So it sucks to see that the company is about to crush many of the best ways to actually experience the whole thing.For anyone using the site on a desktop computer the Reddit experience is fine, I guess (\u201cOld Reddit\u201d is better), but on phones, that all changes. Reddit\u2019s official app sucks, and is absolutely loaded with intrusive ads, meaning a lot of people rely on the work of third-party apps\u2014like the incredibly popular Apollo on iOS and my own favourite, Infinity on Android\u2014to browse and comment.Or they did. Those third-party apps only existed because Reddit allowed them to access their API (essentially their backend); today, the site announced specific changes to that arrangement (first broadly announced last month), implementing charges for the data\u2014similar to those introduced by another platform with popular third-party apps, Twitter\u2014that are so astronomical they\u2019re going to price every third-party app out of the market.The creator of Apollo has done the math, and says:I\u2019ll cut to the chase: 50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure far more than I ever could have imagined.Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I\u2019d be in the red every month.Meanwhile one of the developers of RIF, another popular Android app, says that they are not only also being priced out (if Apollo can\u2019t afford it nobody can), but that Reddit is also implementing a change where third-party apps would lose access to NSFW subreddits, while the official site would not:Removal of sexually explicit material from third-party apps while keeping said content in the official app. Some people have speculated that NSFW is going to leave Reddit entirely, but then why would Reddit Inc have recently expanded NSFW upload support on their desktop site?It\u2019s obvious that the steep pricing, which goes far beyond what these developers were expecting or could ever afford, is not there to make money. Not when it was clear nobody was ever going to be able to pay it. It\u2019s being brought in to crush third-party alternatives, driving every mobile user to the official app where they\u2019ll either have to watch ads or pay for Reddit Premium.Or, you know, stop going to Reddit.Show all 146 comments",

    "hn_content": "Third-party Reddit apps are being impacted by price increases for API access, causing concern over the symbiotic relationship between Reddit and its users. Users provide the content, and mods maintain it, while Reddit provides the infrastructure. Reddit's move has been interpreted by some as a bid to control the narrative and increase ad revenue. Some users suggest they may limit their use of the Reddit platform due to increasing toxicity. Reddits charm has been its ease of use, and varied, niche communities. Nevertheless, the erosion of the platform's user experience and governance have led some to speculate on the need for a new social media platform.There is a discussion on Reddit's current state, its problems, and possible solutions proposed by users. Users note that Reddit's corporate interests often conflict with users' interests, and companies always want more profits. Additionally, the age of casual browsing and users' low investment in the site might make it hard for small communities to thrive, and incentives for engagement reward quantity over quality. Some suggest that Reddit needs a massive overhaul, possibly involving better UX, mobile apps, and PR, while others suggest that moderation is the key to Reddit's success. However, most agree that potential competitors to Reddit face similar issues, such as moderation and bot spam. Some point out Discord as a community platform that could potentially replace Reddit.Users discuss the difficulty of creating a Reddit competitor due to high infrastructure costs and the challenge of gaining user traction. Some suggest targeting a specific, tight-knit community or using alternative features such as real-time chat instead of comments. Others suggest that companies need ad money to monetize their platforms, which is difficult to balance with user experience. Some users express frustration with the official Reddit app and recommend alternatives like Apollo or RiF. Some suggest that Reddit's small, topically-focused communities may have a difficult time finding new homes in the event of Reddit's downfall, and others express skepticism towards the relevance of Usenet.Reddit is making changes that limit customization and force users to the official app, either watching ads or paying for Reddit Premium. Additionally, third-party apps will lose access to NSFW subreddits while the official site will not. This move is driven by pressure from investors to make money. Companies are sacrificing long-term reputation for short-term gains. However, the company's management of social media platforms has become socially destructive and is negatively impacting brand equity. Many users find the original Reddit experience better. Some of these are flocking to open source Reddit alternatives, but none achieved the same level of popularity as Mastodon. Scrappers continue to be used as a possible solution for the limitations imposed by Reddit.Reddit's plan to charge third-party developers for API access has sparked debates among users. Some suggest that Reddit should offer subscriptions instead of ads, while others suggest that API clients would be able to identify ads in the feed and not show them. One commentator warns that if Reddit goes the way of Digg v4, developers should start looking for other platforms to move their userbase to. A Reddit user backlash also criticizes the website for what it has done to its moderators amid suspicions that they work for free. Finally, there\u2019s speculation that Reddit is targeting the video-upload craze that relied on third-party API clients to connect Reddit's upvoted videos with a variety of social media app networks.Reddit is removing support for third-party apps that use their APIs, which could lead to the shutdown of popular third-party Reddit clients. Reddit users are discussing the potential impact on their browsing experience and the lack of alternatives to the site. Some users criticize Reddit's UI, and others highlight moderation issues and hate speech. The conversation also touches on the challenges of maintaining free social media services and the \"cost\" of using such platforms, such as being served ads or trading personal data. Some users suggest alternatives to Reddit, including Mastodon and Offline Reader.People are discussing the new design of Reddit and how it compares to the old one. Some users criticize the lack of link colors and reduction in information density. Others argue that the redesign was successful in attracting a wider audience. There are comments on the design process, such as how the person in charge of the redesign was not a Reddit user before working on it. There's also speculation on the \"enshittification\" process of other platforms, such as Discord, and the potential forking of open-source chat programs. Overall, the discussion revolves around Reddit's purpose, target demographic, and monetization strategy.Users discuss the difference in standards and UI preferences between those who grew up with mobile interfaces like TikTok and Instagram versus those who prefer text-based, minimal UIs for insightful conversations. Reddit's UI is criticized for favoring visual content and enabling deceptive advertising. Some users suggest alternatives like Apollo and Relay for Reddit. Discussion also touches on the monetization of social media platforms, the impact of AI models on content creation, and the potential consequences of sacrificing usability for profit.Reddit's UI and user experience is criticized as terrible. Some suggest that smaller players will die off while established players will continue to play. Apollo is regarded as the best client. HN, despite its flaws, has a far superior user experience compared to Reddit. HN lacks pagination, notification on a reply, and a way to keep up with new comments on a post. HN's UX could be improved on mobile devices. Deep threads become unreadable due to shifting right with no end as replies come in. Code blocks are unreadable on mobile since they cannot be scrolled.",

This was markedly improved with the brilliant Psion 5 keyboard, but at the time the Psion 3a keyboard sufficed perfectly well. Perhaps more remarkable is the sheer speed and consistently smooth performance offered on a 480 x 160 pixel screen, a 7.68 MHz processor and 1 or 2MB of RAM. These numbers are crazily low, but you also got a voice recording microphone and an I/O port for a modem and PC sync.At no point in my years of Psion usage did any device ever crash on me. It worked, it always worked and it never stopped working. Everything was instant and there were so many clever design touches that were way ahead of their time. I would argue that the Psion was the most Apple-like PDA of all and it was way ahead of the Newton. I owned a Newton for a month and it was a huge monstrosity of a device.From the clever hinge mechanism to the shortcut keys above the keyboard to the card slots either side. It was a superb set of hardware features housed in a hard to damage case powered by software that never strained the hardware. It just worked!I read my first eBook on a Psion 3mx, I played my first mobile games on a Psion 3 and I wrote my first web articles on a Psion 5. To this day the Psion range remain above all others in my mind as to what a PDA should have been.Psion died and I moved to Palm. At no point did I ever believe that Palm was a proper mobile system and it never came close to any Psion for me. It felt immature and just didn\u2019t work the way my mind wanted it to work although I admit that it was efficient and had that natural sense about it. The occasional Windows PDA was bought, shouted at and then sold and I continued with Palm until the BlackBerry and then finally the iPhone.It is, Psion, however, that will always be the best PDA hardware and software combination of all to me. And it is remarkable that the Psion 3a when used today still feels modern in many ways. It was way ahead of its time in 1993 and it is definitely not 27 years behind the times in 2020.\u2039 Somryst: losing sleep?

The article goes over the different definitions and lengths used by Python, JavaScript, Rust, and Swift, and argues that there's no one \"correct\" way to measure string length. Instead, the choice of which length method to use depends on the needs of the program or project. Additionally, the article delves into the question of whether string lengths should be computed eagerly or lazily, and suggests that this decision depends on the programming language and the needs of the project.The post discusses the storage and encoding of strings in programming languages with a focus on UTF-8. It argues that UTF-8 is the most practical encoding form due to its superior input/output handling and the fact that it nudges developers towards writing correct code. The post also addresses the issue of extended grapheme clusters and argues that while they are important for some tasks, introducing them into operations that don't require them can lead to failure modes arising from Unicode version dependency. Finally, the post discusses the approach taken by different programming languages in dealing with these issues, such as C++, JavaScript, and Rust.The article discusses the importance of measure-length in different contexts, such as display space and quota limits. The concept of East Asian Width is explained, whereby certain scripts take up more display space than others. The article also presents data on the length of translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in different languages, showing that while UTF-8 and UTF-16 may differ in the number of bytes per character, when accounting for information conveyed, CJK languages are not unfairly disadvantaged. The article concludes that the notion of fairness in measuring string length across all languages is difficult given variations in scripts, and different measures such as UTF-32 or extended grapheme clusters may be more or less appropriate in different contexts.Twitter does not have a straightforward method for measuring the length of a tweet, as different languages require different amounts of space. The Unicode database and East Asian Width don't provide a fair standard for measuring the amount of information conveyed in a language. Counting scalar values is the most fair standard for measuring length, but it still leads to significant disparities in how much information can be conveyed depending on the language. Giving each script a per-script weight also wouldn't work well for the Latin script, which has significant variability in length across languages. The table at the end of the article shows the difference in length for various languages using different measures.",

The author suggests that strings should be viewed as an opaque data type with views into it depending on what you're trying to do and goes on to describe the differences between UTF-8 byte count, parsing code points, editing grapheme clusters, and display bounding box in points. The comments section includes a discussion about the best approach for dealing with strings in Unicode code points, bytes, or graphemes clusters, with some disagreement about which approach is best. The debate includes opinions on programming string algorithms, collaborative text editing, and dealing with strings in different languages and systems.Some argue that relying on Unicode codepoints as a measure of a string is impractical since it cannot be used to determine the number of displayed characters or length in bytes, among other limitations. Instead, people suggest separate types for programming symbols and human displayable text with distinct APIs that answer specific questions, such as the length of human-recognizable characters. However, some disagree, saying separating ASCII and Unicode would be more of a regression. Different languages might have varying definitions of the same term. Grapheme clusters might not be consistent across operating systems and time. Finally, Unicode advocates Han Unification.The post discusses the complexities of Unicode and how it affects string manipulation. Different fonts can show the same character in different ways, and there are separate Unicode points for traditional and simplified Chinese characters, as well as for Japanese and Korean characters. Counting grapheme clusters can also be problematic since it depends on the font used and can lead to errors. The author argues that relying on code points alone is not sufficient for handling strings and proposes viewing strings as opaque data types with different views depending on the task. Python 3's use of UTF-32 and code points is criticized for being unnecessary and expensive.A discussion on the usefulness of different ways to represent string length in Unicode, including grapheme clusters, code points, and code units in various encodings. Different programming languages have different conventions and methods for iterating over strings at these various levels of abstraction. The conversation includes debate about the merits and drawbacks of UTF-16 and UTF-32 as encoding schemes for Unicode strings, and the challenges of dealing with ill-formed strings in these formats. Many participants also discuss the difficulties of dealing with non-ASCII characters in their code, especially when working with external APIs orSeveral programming languages, including Windows, Java, C#, and JavaScript, use UTF-16, an encoding that was adopted at a time when it was believed that 64K code points would suffice. Despite its limitations, the languages still use the encoding today because of backward compatibility.UTF-16 string length should be deprecated because the number of \"length bars\" you get is misleading, as some characters may be represented by multiple code units and so may have multiple length bars. The Python 3 approach of using a sequence of scalar value code points is considered the most correct. However, some argue that it is not very practical and that Unicode defines text as a series of encoded character codes, which are represented by numbers from 0 to 10FFFF_16. This definition implicitly acknowledges the history of how Unicode support was added to different platforms.The comments section discusses how to count the length of strings and the challenges that arise with Unicode characters and grapheme clusters. There is a debate about the practicality of different approaches, including using code points, grapheme clusters, or byte counts. Some programming languages like Swift and Python use different methods for different types of strings, while others like Ruby and JavaScript have built-in functions for different measurements. There are also references to tools and libraries that can help with text manipulation, such as Harfbuzz and Unicode X-Ray. The comments touch on the complexities of Unicode and the potential for errors in counting text length.A discussion thread on Hacker News explores the character count of emojis in different Unicode encodings. In GSM-7, emojis can take up to 16 bits per character, reducing the message capacity to 70 characters, as opposed to the standard 160 characters. Python programming language was also mentioned as a tool for manipulating emojis.

His dissertation was \"Difference Methods for Mixed Boundary Value Problems.\u201dA CLE Moore instructor from 1959 to 1961, he joined the MIT faculty in 1962. A full professor in 1970, Strang focuses his research on mathematical analysis, linear algebra, and partial differential equations.\u201cHe has had a tremendous impact on the teaching of mathematics to tens of thousands of students at MIT through his lectures, to countless students at other academic institutions through his textbooks, and to millions of people all over the globe through his online lectures and digital media,\u201d says Professor Michel Goemans, head of the Department of Mathematics.Play video1934Year in which Strang was born, in Chicago.His parents William and Mary Catherine Strang emigrated to the United States from Scotland. Strang and his sister Vivian grew up in Washington and Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended the Principia School in St. Louis, Missouri. He and his wife Jillian have three sons, David, John, and Robert, and 10 grandchildren.15,000Number of students he has taught at MIT since he was a CLE Moore instructor.Strang has taught calculus, analysis, and computational science and engineering (18.085). But it\u2019s his linear algebra class that evolved into a course eventually taken by a third of the MIT student body.Strang began teaching linear algebra in the 1970s, during a time when engineers and scientists wrote large software packages using the finite element method to solve structural problems in mechanics. But he saw the need to restructure the class so he could teach linear algebra in a constructive way, to show that it was related to everything from pure math to the internet. \u201cWe needed to explain the ideas in concrete language that students could follow and understand and use,\u201d he explains.17Number of awards and recognitions he has received for his research, service, and teaching.These include the 1976 Chauvenet Prize; the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\u2019 (SIAM\u2019s) 2003 Award for Distinguished Service; and the 2020 Irwin Sizer Award for the Most Significant Improvement to MIT Education.Strang also won the Graduate School Teaching Award in 2003; the Von Neumann Prize Medal of the U.S. Association for Computational Mechanics in 2005; the Mathematical Association of America\u2019s Lester Ford Prize in 2005 and the Haimo Prize in 2006; and the Henrici and Su Buchin Prizes of the International Congress of Industrial & Applied Mathematics in 2007.He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. In 2019, he was elected as a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in the section of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. His service to the academic community includes serving as president of SIAM, chair of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics, chair of the U.S. National Committee on Mathematics, member of the Abel Prize Committee, and chair of the math department\u2019s Pure Mathematics Committee.20Number of books Strang has written so far.Strang recently released \u201cIntroduction to Linear Algebra,\u201d the sixth edition of the book he first published over 40 years ago. In 2019 he released \"Linear Algebra and Learning from Data.\"In his retirement he will continue running Wellesley-Cambridge Press, which has published his books since 1986. Its newest outlet is Wellesley Publishers in India; \u201cIntroduction to Linear Algebra\u201d has been translated into French, German, Greek, Japanese, Portuguese, and Chinese.His textbooks are celebrated for their simple methods to teach complex subjects.\u201cThe good abstractions from the deeper classes are in Gil\u2019s texts \u2014 but yet they are made accessible the Gil Strang way,\u201d says MIT Professor Alan Edelman. \u201cYou can still find vector spaces, subspaces, dimensions \u2026 and linear transformations. All those ideas from pure linear algebra are not lost, just made more relevant. I love watching how he weaves these deeper ideas into the flow of the class. Gil sneaks in the real spirit of this beautiful mathematical subject, and it\u2019s for everybody.\u201d\u201cUndergraduate mathematics textbooks are not what they used to be, and Gilbert Strang's superb new edition of \u2018Introduction to Linear Algebra\u2019 is an example of everything that a modern textbook could possibly be, and more,\u201d says book reviewer Douglas Farenick of the University of Regina.

I love his words, his tone, his pace, and the very way that the answer seems like a surprise when we all know, he understood it from the beginning.\u201dChat comments from around the worldEdelman and Grinfeld led a team intent on publicizing Gil\u2019s last lecture, including creating a web page with an online countdown to the May 15 event. In response, countless Strang fans posted their well-wishes and thanks via online comments on social media and in the video\u2019s chat stream.\u201cGil, Best wishes for a great final lecture, from your #1 fan in Ithaca!\u201d posted Cornell University math professor and former MIT math instructor Steven Strogatz, in the final lecture chat stream. When a fellow chat member called him \u201ca fan boi,\u201d Strogatz responded, \u201cYou bet I'm fan-boying! I had the honor of teaching Gil's 18.085 course many times at MIT and loved learning from Gil and working with him. He's as wonderful as he seems online.\u201dAnd from others:\u201cA legend! Helped me get into robotics in my mid-30s.\u201d\u201cTeaching math in a way that instills a love for the subject is a challenging task, much harder than solving complex equations. But your teaching style effortlessly achieves this.\u201d\u201cThe best teacher I never had. But thanks to MIT for sharing his linear algebra lectures. He has been a blessing for thousands of his students.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe this legend is retiring. At least his former lectures will be available for future students.\u201d\u201cYour 18.06 course was my first-ever experience with a superb quality math professor who taught me a new subject in an intuitive way & made me appreciate the abstract beauty!\u201d\u201cYour teaching was my only source of quality education growing up in India.\u201d\u201cThat was a very emotional hour for so many people around the world! Prof. Strang made the world a better place in his own personal way!\u201d\u201cGil Strang made linear algebra accessible to the masses. I often ask myself when teaching, \u2018Am I being as clear and approachable as Strang?\u2019 I'm still working on it.\u201d\u201cGil\u2019s lecture was probably the first time I realized the difference between MIT and other universities.\u201d\u201cYour amazing lectures on OCW helped me not only snag an A+ for linear algebra but also lend a hand to a bunch of other students who were struggling.\u201d\u201cProf. Strang's 18.06 MIT OCW series was the first lecture series I watched while waiting to study university math. \u2026 To this day, I still remember and use his column picture and row picture of matrix multiplication (each column of AB is a linear combination of columns of A) \u2014 this is seldom taught elsewhere but it really helped.\u201dLinear momentsStrang hopes that, among other parts of his legacy, he has left behind a good road map to keep stoking a love of linear algebra.\u201cTeaching has been a wonderful life,\u201d says Strang. \u201cAnd I am so grateful to everyone who likes linear algebra and sees its importance. So many universities (and even high schools) now appreciate how beautiful it is and how valuable it is. That movement will continue because it is right.\u201dPRESS MENTIONSUSA TodayProf. Gilbert Strang received a standing ovation after delivering his last lecture after over 60 years of teaching at MIT, reports Saleen Martin for USA Today. \u201cTeaching has been a wonderful life,\u201d wrote Strang in the comments section of his last lecture on YouTube. \u201cI am so grateful to everyone who likes linear algebra and sees its importance.

That was the first online course I've done and it was on MIT OpenCourseWare.Then, when I was actually getting a math degree years later in Manchester, UK, I got the highest score on the linear algebra exam out of all the classes I did. I doubt I would have done so well without Strang.replyfnordpiglet 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Never took his courses but used his book. My linear algebra teacher was awesome. The two changed my life.replykiechu 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Strang course is available on YT as part of MIT OCW. Amazing lecturer.reply8bitsrule 2 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I tried a linear algebra course once; guess I got the wrong teacher, checked out in 3 weeks.A few teachers have the juice, most have the pulp.replyneodypsis 5 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I struggled with a very deficient linear algebra course from my local university in 2009-2010. Fortunately I discovered Gilbert Strang's book and OCW lectures, which gave me the motivation to continue. I still own that copy.replyrevskill 1 hour ago | prev | next [\u2013]There's no shortcut to Linear Algebra understanding. Most of reasoning is boring, lack of creativity, dry as hell.replybeyonddream 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I have listened to his lectures but found it hard to follow his train of thoughts and pace and I am sure I am in the minority :). What worked somewhat is listening to 2x speed.replyinfocollector 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]He is a legend in linear algebra, and probably will be for a long time. His video lectures have proven invaluable, benefiting millions.replyomgmajk 8 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I just watched that video in the article of his last lecture and it was indeed fun!replyPartiallyTyped 8 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]MIT's profs Strang and the late professor Winston have positively changed my life. I knew it was him from the title and was worried he ... yeah.replythe__alchemist 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This dude taught the Lin alg courses that went on MitX.

    "hn_content": "A humorous thread on Hacker News ensues after a study published in the British Medical Journal about parachute use to prevent death and trauma when jumping from aircraft. The thread includes discussions on the terminal velocity of mice and whether they need a parachute, whether shrews could survive a fall from a thousand-yard mine shaft, and if squirrels can survive falls. There was also a discussion on rodents being released at altitude and surviving. The post reminded readers that correlation is not causation and cautioned against making conclusions from the study's results. Overall, the thread provided entertainment and humor surrounding a potentially serious topic.Advocates of evidence-based medicine emphasize the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in obtaining high-quality evidence. However, many clinical practice guidelines are based on weak evidence, such as expert opinion or observational studies. The goal of evidence-based medicine is not to dismiss these sources of evidence, but to prioritize obtaining the highest quality evidence possible. The \"Parachute Study\" is an example of a randomized controlled trial that demonstrated no difference in survival rates between those who used a parachute when jumping from a plane and those who did not. The study highlights the importance of considering the nuances of research rather than relying solely on statistical significance. In general, statistical significance only indicates that the effect did not come from sampling error, not that the result is necessarily true.A satirical response to the critique of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), presented as a randomized controlled trial on the use of parachutes, highlights the limitations of such trials and their interpretation. Despite being satire, the authors still maintain that such trials remain the gold standard for evaluating most new treatments. The study does bring attention to the flawed philosophy of only relying on RCT studies to make decisions about the importance of a paper. The study also calls attention to selection bias and how it affects RCTs\u00a0in particular.",
