But the celebration masked a tumultuous, decades-long relationship between Karikó and the University. Karikó, an adjunct professor of neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for her past research into mRNA technology alongside co-laureate and Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the Medical School Drew Weissman. Karikó and Weissman's research was critical for the development of the COVID-19 vaccines — from which Penn has earned around $1.2 billion. \"At a University built around [a] Franklin spirit, there are no better exemplars of these character traits than our Nobel laureates, Dr. Kati Karikó and Dr. Drew Weissman,\" Penn President Liz Magill said at a press conference the day the prize was named. However, eight current and former colleagues of Karikó told The Daily Pennsylvanian that — over the course of three decades — the University repeatedly shunned Karikó and her research, despite its groundbreaking potential. The colleagues told a story of a researcher whose work ethic helped her succeed against all odds — including doubtful administrators, language barriers, and a system that cuts costs by demoting researchers who fail to earn grant funding. \"We acknowledge and are grateful for the valuable contributions Dr. Karikó has made to science and to Penn throughout her time with the University,\" a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to the DP. In 1989, four years after she arrived in the United States, Karikó was appointed an adjunct professor at the Medical School. She worked on mRNA research under cardiologist Elliot Barnathan until his departure in 1997. From the very beginning of her time at Penn, Karikó's research was overlooked by medical school executives, she wrote in her recently published memoir, \"Breaking Through: My Life in Science.\" These executives included Jim Wilson, the director of Penn’s embattled Gene Therapy Program, and Judith Swain, chief of cardiovascular medicine. Wilson remains a member of Penn's faculty. Wilson did not respond to a request for comment. “[Jim] Wilson never seemed interested in mRNA or my research,\" Karikó wrote. \"He barely glanced my way; on the rare occasions he did, it always felt as if he were looking right through me.\" After Karikó unsuccessfully appealed to Wilson for her research to be included in an upcoming grant, Swain requested that Karikó not attend similar meetings in the future — and asked Karikó to stop speaking to her Hungarian colleague in their native language. \"She told me 'people' were complaining about me, saying that I was too difficult,\" Karikó wrote of a time she was called to Swain's office. During these early years, Karikó wrote that Penn prevented her from having access to basic lab supplies, such as deionized water. All of her grant applications for future research, directed at private and government agencies and the University Research Foundation, were also denied. Five years into her tenure at Penn, Karikó was informed that she would not be promoted to the position of research associate professor, the typical stepping stone for researchers with her level of experience. In 1997, Barnathan, her supervisor, left the University, leaving Karikó without a clear path forward. \"[I had] no grants, no funding, [and] no respect from anyone with any formal power,” she wrote. (Photo courtesy of Hamna Shahnawaz). After Barnathan left, Karikó was helped by a colleague, David Langer — now the chair of neurosurgery at New York’s Lenox Hill Hospital. Langer convinced the chair of Penn's neurosurgery department to hire Karikó as the department's senior head of research. “If she wasn’t hired, there may not have been a COVID vaccine,\" Langer said. Even at that early point in her career, Langer said he was confident that Karikó would make substantial strides in the field of mRNA. “She is incredibly hardworking, just insane,” Langer said. \"And she’s a genius, so eventually she was going to solve this problem, whether with me or with someone else.” Not long after, Karikó met Drew Weissman, her future research partner and co-Nobel Prize laureate, during a chance encounter at a copy machine. Karikó and Weissman began to cooperate on research into mRNA technology. 2001 College graduate David Scales — now an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine — worked in Karikó and Weissman’s lab as an undergraduate student at Penn. Scales said that he was surprised by the funding challenges faced by Karikó and other talented scientists. “It was weird to me to see this idea that they’re only going to fund you for a short amount of time, and if you’re not able to get external grants, then they’re going to wash their hands with you and say good luck,\" he said. In 1999, Sean Grady — now the chair of the neurosurgery department — arrived at Penn and immediately sought to revisit the department's existing allocation of resources. “Not long after arriving, Sean sat me down,” Karikó wrote. “He observed that I’d had some publications in reputable, if small, journals. But, he said, he was under tremendous budgetary pressure and was concerned about my lack of funding.” Over the following years, Grady repeatedly critiqued Karikó — paying minimal attention to her research in favor of the metrics used by Penn to evaluate her success, such as publication records, citations, and funding. “Unless something changes, this isn’t going to go well,\" Grady told Karikó, according to her memoir. Grady and others within Penn Medicine aimed to maximize the returns on their investments in individual researchers, Langer said. To Grady, $35,000 spent on Karikó was \"$35,000 that could be spent supporting a new scientist who may make a discovery,\" Langer added. In 2005, Karikó and Weissman jointly made the discovery that would later win them the Nobel Prize, receiving minimal recognition from the academic community at the time. (Photo courtesy of Robert Sobol). Robert Sobol, a professor who worked with Karikó at Temple University before she moved to Penn, said that the development was \"groundbreaking\" in retrospect. “Karikó and I started investigating RNA in the late 1990s, and we figured out what made it so inflammatory and how to get rid of the inflammation. We published that research in 2005,” Weissman previously told the DP. “That is when people, at least academics, started to get interested in its potential, and companies started to get interested in it around 2010.” Karikó told the DP in 2020, as the first COVID-19 vaccines became available to Penn Med's frontline health workers and researchers, that she knew the the discovery in 2005 would lead to major developments in the future. “When I discovered the potential of the RNA, I had a feeling that it could be anything,” Karikó told the DP. “But nobody believed, so I couldn’t release that feeling.” Her former colleague Norbert Pardi, who is now an assistant professor in Penn’s Department of Microbiology, said that Karikó and Weissman's work ethic motivated the entire lab to work harder. Penn was eventually awarded a patent for the modified RNA developed by Karikó and Weissman, enabling the University to have the final say in how the patent would be licensed. To control the direction of future research, Karikó and Weissman sought to purchase the patent themselves — but it was sold in its entirety to a different company. Karikó requested to be reinstated to a faculty position at Penn in 2010 but was initially rejected. Karikó wrote that administrators told her that she was \"not of faculty quality\" — citing how individuals who have previously been demoted can not be promoted back to the faculty track. After Karikó appealed the decision and rejoined the faculty, colleagues said that Grady continued to undermine Karikó. But it was the removal of her lab space that pushed Karikó to leave Penn, according to an employee close to Karikó who requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from the University. “She was kicked out of her lab so many times, but she made something good out of all of these failures,\" Éva Remenyik, a Hungarian dermatologist close to Karikó, said. In 2013, Karikó said she returned to her lab after spending time away to find all of her belongings having been packed, moved, and misplaced at Grady's direction. Karikó then left Penn's campus to work at BioNTech, a German company that focuses on mRNA-based technologies later that year. Langer told the DP that many of Karikó’s superiors may not have recognized the impacts of her research and potential successes. “People didn't necessarily see her as who she was going to become,” Langer said. “Michael Jordan was overlooked by two teams and is the greatest basketball player of all time, [and] Tom Brady was drafted 199th. The value and the ultimate success of somebody is not always readily apparent, even when it’s right in front of your eyes.” Scales also said that Penn's approach of giving minimal funds to Karikó followed a similar model to most peer institutions. He said many research institutions provide some degree of startup funds, and the expectation is for researchers to acquire external grants otherwise. All of those interviewed commended Karikó for winning the Nobel Prize alongside Weissman. “I think it’s a testament to her fortitude,” Sobol said. “Now that you look back on the calendar, you see that she was 20 years ahead of where everyone is now.” Scales said he hopes that Karikó's win will prompt changes to funding allocations in research. “I do hope that it causes Penn and a bunch of other institutions that fund science this way to reflect a little bit on what the chances are that some scientists who do not get funding, and wind up leaving, end up being like Katalin Karikó,” Scales said.

By far the largest pressure on new faculty is the ability to get money into her lab, and by extension the university since they take a very hefty cut (50-100%! btw this doubles the \"cost\" of the grant, it doesn&#x27;t lessen the amount the professor gets). Getting approved for the money via the grant process means having published \"interesting\" research along avenues of inquiry that other folks find worth pursuing. Often times this means building on existing lines of research over pursuing new paths.The hiring process is setup basically to filter for folks who they think are the most likely to publish lots of papers, collaborate to push existing lines of inquiry, write lots of hopefully approved grants, and grow a lab into what is effectively a \"successful small business\". Quality is an after thought taken care of by what passes for peer review.The incentives for everyone involved is just a complete and total mess. I&#x27;m reading tea leaves here, but my guess as to why she was never hired is that she was deemed \"unable to get grants\". Had she been, then she would have found herself hired immediately somewhere because universities are incentivized to play a numbers game and get as many folks in writing grants as possible. reply exmadscientist 16 hours agoparent> the university since they take a very hefty cut (50-100%! btw this doubles the \"cost\" of the grant, it doesn&#x27;t lessen the amount the professor gets)Don&#x27;t forget that this is actually money laundering. Our NIH grants had major strings attached, like \"you may not buy non-instrumentation computers\" (at least, that&#x27;s what I was told, I did not actually get to read the grants). So the University helpfully launders the money for you through a kickback from its overhead cut, at the tiny tiny price of keeping most of it. You may then spend the kickbacks without restriction.The whole system is insane. Even having lived it for years I barely believe some of my own stories. reply zhdc1 3 hours agorootparent> Don&#x27;t forget that this is actually money laundering. Our NIH grants had major strings attached, like \"you may not buy non-instrumentation computers\" (at least, that&#x27;s what I was told, I did not actually get to read the grants).The EU does it better. At least with the old Horizon 2020 scheme, up to 20% of the grant amount could be set aside for overhead costs. Anything more would get flagged if the grant was ever audited.This limited how much participating universities could repurpose. I don’t know how Horizon EU is set up, but my guess is that it follows the same approach. reply tnecniv 10 hours agorootparentprevUniversities are the best at creative accounting. PhD students get charged “tuition” but that is normally (hopefully) out of the pocket of their advisor or another fellowship. So your pay is valued at 120k despite you seeing a quarter of that.I know some grad students that used that fact to their advantage when applying for credit cards but it’s still gross. reply atrettel 8 hours agorootparentWhen I got my PhD (at a public university), I almost got charged for the out-of-state part of this fictitious tuition because I did not switch my residency to the state where I got my PhD. The requirements for residency were pretty onerous from what I remember and I would have been unlikely to qualify. Instead, I took my \"preliminary exam\". Upon passing the exam, my title changed from \"PhD student\" to \"PhD candidate\" and it waived the out-of-state tuition for the rest of my PhD. So universities take this stuff seriously but have arcane procedures for edge cases like this that kinda make a mockery of the whole thing. That said, I&#x27;m grateful I did not have pay in the end! reply pfannkuchen 9 hours agorootparentprevHow does treating the tuition as a charge and payment (instead of the tuition being zero) benefit the university? reply moregrist 8 hours agorootparentIt transfers money from grant funds into the University general fund, where it can be used for other purposes, like paying for less lucrative departments and administrative salaries. More or less, this plus the ph.d. student’s stipend is the cost of the student, and both can be charged to a grant that the student is working on.This is baked into grant funding and has been for at least 40-50 years. No one is doing anything underhanded here; NIH is fully aware of the situation. Some grant organizations, including NSF, are much stingier with their grant overhead (ie: don’t allow it).Whether or not the overhead is fair is a matter of opinion, I guess. I don’t think it’s even close to the most broken aspect of grant funding, though. reply ftyers 6 hours agorootparentNSF definitely does, and it&#x27;s often (at least at R1) of >50% reply analog31 8 hours agorootparentprevIn a lot of departments, employees are unofficially expected to buy computers out of their own pockets. Workers are often quite incensed about this.In turn the employees have a \"fuck you\" attitude about it. They often buy the cheapest laptop, and won&#x27;t let their department&#x27;s IT person touch it. As a result, most work is done with things like out-of-date OS&#x27;s and software versions, and ad-hoc security and backups. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentprev\"you may not buy non-instrumentation computers\"This will come as a shock to the three laptops, one desktop, one server and five cluster nodes I have purchased on various grants.Also the \"kickback\" as you put it (aka indirect cost returns) vary wildly both between and within universities. For example, we get zero indirect cost returns, but do get money back for unallocated spending if we bring in a higher percentage of our salary than we are obligated to. reply robwwilliams 9 hours agorootparentprevWow—you and I live in different university universes. The overheads are essential to running research universities. They are definitely not kickbacks. This is obvious when comparing research costs at national laboratories versus research costs for comparable work at most universities. reply queuebert 9 hours agorootparentOverhead rates at pure research non-profits are much lower than at universities. The difference is the amount of bureaucracy. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentThis is not universally true. The last grant I had with a pure research non-profit, my state university had a markedly lower overhead rate, as well as far more flexibility in lowering it (if a sponsor pre-specifies a lower rate, we almost always accept that). reply robwwilliams 7 hours agorootparentprevNot true at all in USA. Check out overheads at Salk Institute or other high profile non-profits. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentprevWould they still be if they cut down on building sports facilities? reply CamperBob2 15 hours agorootparentprevOur NIH grants had major strings attached, like \"you may not buy non-instrumentation computers\" (at least, that&#x27;s what I was told, I did not actually get to read the grants)Sadly, that bit of goofiness goes back a long way. It&#x27;s why the early HP desktops were sold as \"calculators.\" Many important customers told them that buying a computer required approval from the board of directors, but anybody could buy a \"calculator\" out of petty cash. reply dctoedt 13 hours agorootparentAboard the USS Enterprise (the aircraft carrier) in the late 1970s, I automated some of my division&#x27;s reports by writing BASIC programs on a \"programmable calculator\" — a desktop in all but name — that was owned by the air wing (IIRC) and used for setting up missions.(It was a day of celebration when the 8K of RAM was upgraded to 16K.) reply mattkrause 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also not actually true.The NIH themselves is fine with you buying computers that directly support the \"aims\" of the grant (e.g., data analysis). They don&#x27;t want you buying \"general\" office equipment off a grant.However, most universities are touchy about this and default-deny all computer purchases unless you yell the chapter and verse of the regs at them (which I have now done several times). reply CamperBob2 14 hours agorootparentYep, I&#x27;m referring to a historical anecdote, not current practice.It&#x27;ll be tough to dig up a solid citation for the HP \"calculator\" story but I&#x27;ve heard it from more than one reasonably-credible source, e.g.: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retrocomputing.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9499&#x2F;when... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hewlett-Packard_9100A#cite_not... . reply kps 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve heard the same about the DEC PDP branding — a “Programmable Data Processor” could slip through where a “computer” couldn&#x27;t. reply mananaysiempre 13 hours agorootparent“Inside the AS&#x2F;400” by Soltis quotes a story of IBM’s Rochester group developing the System&#x2F;3 minicomputer (followed by the incompatible System&#x2F;38, later rebranded the AS&#x2F;400 and later still the i) under the guise of an “accounting machine”. reply mattkrause 14 hours agorootparentprevOh, I totally believe it!I just wanted to explain that although \"No computers on NIH grants\" is still current practice at most universities, it shouldn&#x27;t be. reply robwwilliams 9 hours agorootparentprevThat statement is flat out false. You can buy as many computers as you can justify on an NIH research project. I have bought several dozens over 35 years without a peep. reply mjburgess 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat amuses, and irritates, me is that academics frequently project this insanity onto Business or The Profit Motive.Having close connections in academia, that world is the worst of what can be imagined. A highly competitive start-up, or scale-up, environment has a level of Reason and Merit imposed by the market which rationalises most everything (even the insane VC fantasyland headline-driven stuff is intelligible).Academia is the worst combination of every imaginable macro force. reply quacked 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d agree that Reason and Merit are always applied by the market, unless the market is referring to \"whatever VCs can be convinced to give money to\". However, the crux of what you&#x27;re saying, which is that in academia Reason and Merit are thrown directly out of the window is completely true.My favorite discrepancy is in hiring. In startups, you can win a $150k&#x2F;year job in a ten minute conversation with the right person and be at work the following Monday, even that afternoon in some cases. This is especially true if your previous work is already known to the person doing the hiring.In academia (and to a lesser extent government work) they&#x27;re conducting 6-month searches and stringing along candidates for months at a time for $65k jobs with a fraction of the responsibility of the equivalent in the private industry. reply mjburgess 14 hours agorootparentIn the medium term, on average, the market tends to kill-off sheer stupidity. It is kinda traumatic in the short-term to see how much stupidity is rewarded, of course. (And here, are VCs anything more than serial idiots?)But if you really want to persue a basically competent merit-based path, there&#x27;s usually one available. You can make 2x in a crypto conjob, or 1x on a gamble that someone needs a plausible value-adding service.I just don&#x27;t see this logic at work in academia. The only reason I care here is how often academics have a kind of superstition of &#x27;business&#x27; which is nothing other than a description of their own situation. When, in reality, freedoom from these chronic stupidities lies in everything they claim to hate. reply StressedDev 7 hours agorootparentA VC which is a serial idiot will eventually run out of money. One thing to remember is that not all VCs are the same and there probably are some which are very good at what they do.Another way of saying this is just because some VCs are not good at their job does not mean all VCs are not good at their job. reply tobyjsullivan 5 hours agorootparent> A VC which is a serial idiot will eventually run out of money.This is not really true as VCs are not the sources of the money they invest. VCs raise money from their backers and there really is a (virtually) infinite amount of money available to raise, even for a repeatedly unsuccessful VC firm.As with the startups themselves, the key skill is raising, not earning the actual ROI. reply BurningFrog 8 hours agorootparentprevI assume this is in part because the $150k startup hire can get fired just as fast if they don&#x27;t impress, while the corresponding academia process takes months or years. reply IG_Semmelweiss 7 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also inmediate feedback150k salary ships, sells, or is out of a job or the company goes bankrupt, whichever is 1stThe equvalent researcher, with almost all kinds of research, will always keep the same job for years, and the University is always going to be around regardless of the research being done reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentGiven very few tenure-track faculty are making $150K, it&#x27;s more like \"A 85K salary has a ticking clock - and considers themselves lucky to have it - wherein if they don&#x27;t meet some fairly steep performance goals, they are automatically fired.\" reply jltsiren 14 hours agorootparentprevAcademic hiring processes are ridiculous. Not because anyone wants it that way but because citizens like to complain. They complain when they think tax&#x2F;tuition money is being used for inapproriate or frivolous purposes. They complain when they see nepotism and corruption. They complain about perceived political biases and discrimination. And so on.Every time something goes wrong badly enough to cause a scandal, new processes are put in place to prevent that specific harm in the future. On the other hand, nobody really cares about effective and efficient use of tax money. People surely complain about waste, but the complaints are rarely specific enough to have consequences. Given a choice between preventing a specific harm and using tax money better, people almost always choose preventing the specific harm.The salaries are what they are, because universities can&#x27;t afford to pay more. There is only so much tax&#x2F;tuition money available to them. People like to complain about administrative bloat, but it&#x27;s their fault really. Every time people complain about something specific in the academia, they are advocating for giving more money to the administration to fix that, and for giving less money to the people who teach and do research. That&#x27;s just the way public management works.Additionally, academic hiring processes are more involved than in the industry, because there is less responsibility. Not despite it. People are effectively given money to do things they would do anyway, and the employer often can&#x27;t tell the difference between a good hire and a bad hire, except maybe much later. If you can&#x27;t fix you mistakes in a timely manner, you&#x27;ll probably want to think things through before making the decision. reply rmah 13 hours agorootparentUniversities could afford to pay more if they redirect funds from paying for \"administrator\" to paying for instructors and researchers. Or diverting funds from beautification projects. Or from the mass of consulting firms they hire for various things. There is now an average of only 2.5 faculty per administrator at universities and many of the better research universities have ratios closer to 1:1. Really, it&#x27;s a question of incentives and priorities. reply bluGill 13 hours agorootparentThey can&#x27;t do that though. All those administrators are preventing the faculty from abusing their position. Most of the abuse are the type of thing that someone has done in the past. What you really seem to be claiming is that the loss from faculty abuse is in general less than the costs of those administrators. I&#x27;m not sure if this is true or not - this is the real debate that we are not having. (I&#x27;m sure in some cases it is true, but in others it is not)As for beautification projects: that projects often bring in big donars. It is hard to say if they are worth the costs or not, but we need to start by being clear. A ugly brutalist building would be a lot cheaper but probably is too far the other way. reply ModernMech 5 hours agorootparentprev> Universities could afford to pay more if they redirect funds from paying for \"administrator\" to paying for instructors and researchers.Which administrators tho? There are about a dozen I rely on every day, and if you eliminate them, you&#x27;ll be causing a lot more work for me, the researcher. Many admin positions are created after faculty complain their workload is getting too large. A lot of people seem to think they are just bloat, but they can actually be very helpful. To be constructive, you need to be more specific than parroting the \"just get rid of admin\" trope. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentThis - my university is actually a fairly lean organization that&#x27;s continually pushed more and more administrative burden onto faculty.A lot of people like hand waving and saying \"Administrators\", but like the idea that most regulations are written in blood, there are tangible reasons for most administrative positions. Even the admins I don&#x27;t like and I think are a waste of space are that way because of them, and I can envision a useful person being in their place. reply ModernMech 5 hours agorootparentprevStartups work under the \"fire fast\" mentality, where if someone isn&#x27;t working out, you axe them asap. For a professor, ramp-up period can be a couple semesters to over a year for them to experience all the seasons of faculty life. You want someone who will stick around for 3+ years. Firing fast is something you want to do under only as a last resort. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also expensive, because lab start up costs money. The cost of a faculty recruitment in the sciences can be well into the hundreds of thousands. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat amuses, and irritates, me is that industry frequently projects their own system onto academia.They get incensed at the idea of overhead - but don&#x27;t recognize that we&#x27;re not legally allowed to have a profit margin. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentprev> Don&#x27;t forget that this is actually money laundering.For anyone questioning this line, let&#x27;s remember a few things- Graduate students (in this setting) are typically funded, so the cost of their credits (often higher than undergrads) are determined by the university and such costs are a major factor of what is taken out of the grant the professor gets their portion (sometimes after the uni&#x27;s cut!). The rest then goes to the student&#x27;s salary and hopefully some left over for new lab equipment.- Grant money must all be used and cannot be put aside for future investments. It is better to buy shitty lab equipment because you don&#x27;t have enough for good equipment and can&#x27;t invest any excess (even if by being spartan elsewhere). If you don&#x27;t use the money in the allotted timeframe you&#x27;re considered to have improperly managed the funding.- A funded graduate student is considered 49% employee and 51% student.- Graduate students in year 3+ (median 5 years for PhD) are not taking courses and doing full time research and likely being a TA at the same time. (Tuition costs do not change)- A successful graduate student sees their advisor less and less as they dive into their niche area of research where the advisor no longer has any level of expertise. (This is what&#x27;s supposed to happen)- When a graduate student stops taking classes they still pay for credits and at the same rate (albeit through funding, which they are often writing for at this point. But prof gets the award).- Universities pay students and professors to publish papers and judge success by publication in venues- Students and professors \"judge\" works submitted to venues by other students and professors for no pay (i.e. on university time)- Venues take copyright ownership over works they deem valuable and put it behind a paywall- Universities pay for access to venues where their researchers published in and where their researchers performed volunteer service for.- Promotions are given to those who&#x27;s name is on the most works, regardless of position or contribution to that work.Think about it this way, what if we framed this as a job? Your job considers you a junior part time employee for the first 5 years and if you don&#x27;t complete all 5 years every other job will treat you as a junior part timer. Your first two years 50% of your time is spent doing training, 50% of your time is spent teaching the interns (who pay, but who spend 100% of their day training), and whatever time you have left is spent performing research. You&#x27;re told you&#x27;re a part time employee because 51% of your time is training. After two years you finish training but get no change in pay (maybe +$100&#x2F;mo), nor graduate to a full time employee. By year 4 your manager never shows up except few months your manager comes around telling you that you need to make sure to make a deadline and they need to read your report first. They demand it is in their hands a week early so they can review it. 3am the night before the deadline they ask for major rewrites, this is the first you&#x27;ve heard of any problems. 10 minutes past the deadline you&#x27;re still getting requests to \"modify the graphic\" with instructions like \"a little to the left\" or \"I don&#x27;t like the colors\" and the iterative process can only be performed by back and forth submissions with random delays as your manager won&#x27;t touch the source code. Every few months your manager stops by to check on progress and ask you to write a report that needs to be written by tomorrow. They&#x27;ll slap their name at the top and if successful they advance their career. Your reward is via proxy.

Anyone want to add anything? reply jacquesm 13 hours agorootparentThis is really painful to read.That whole system seems to be so ripe for disruption. reply godelski 13 hours agorootparentWell just know you&#x27;re not alone. I hope you got out without killing your passions.Fwiw, I intend to lead by example. I love researching. I have a long term internship where I even do research (unfortunately not closely tied to my PhD work lol). But since I read math books and research as a hobby, I intend to simply do what I call for (in other comments) and just post to GitHub + Openreview + Arxiv and call it a fucking day. I hope to get others to join me in this paradigm shift. We all fucking rely on arxiv anyways and I&#x27;m pretty sure more of us find works via twitter&#x2F;google scholar&#x2F;semantic scholar&#x2F;word of mouth more than we find works via journal&#x2F;conference listings (twitter post of \"just got accepted\" counts as former, not latter).I&#x27;m not so sure we need \"disruption\" as much as we need to just cut off the fucking leeches. The problem was turning school into a business. Thinking that profits align with education of students. But we have no strong evidence that higher ranked schools produce higher quality students, but rather only better connected ones.Idk, maybe the private sector can disrupt it. But they&#x27;d have to perform a pretty similar feat, though there is a monetary benefit. Because the world is disillusioned that Stanford students are substantially better than Boston College students, you can pay the BC student less. In fact, many places do, but the issue is Stanford has a huge fucking media arm so we don&#x27;t hear about that. They can also stop using number of papers as criteria but rather quality of papers (i.e. use domain experts to hire domain experts. Novel idea, I know...)I&#x27;m just shooting in the dark here. I&#x27;d actually like to hear other peoples suggestions. Even if we&#x27;re just spitballing at this point (I don&#x27;t think anyone has strong solutions yet, that&#x27;s okay), we just need to get the ball rolling at this point instead of talking about what a ball&#x27;s relationship to an apple or the sour more rounder apples that are orange. reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentI got lucky: I never went in. My family more or less imploded in the middle of my highschool track and I went to work instead and that put me on a faster road to a lot of interaction with the computers of the day than school would have given me and that led to an interesting career. If that hadn&#x27;t happened I may well have ended up in academia and I somehow feel I dodged a bullet there because my ideas of what university was like at the time seem to have very much been informed by pink glasses and meeting the occasional very interesting person who was part of the academic world. reply godelski 7 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t get me wrong, there is a lot I like about academia. Honestly, there hasn&#x27;t been any other point of time in my life that I&#x27;ve been able to dedicate so much of my time to learning and researching. Even as I&#x27;m in a long term internship, that freedom is slipping away. Academia is supposed to be about protecting that freedom to explore and learn, but simply too much bullshit took over. Bureaucrats love metrics regardless of the value of those metrics. Maybe I wouldn&#x27;t feel as disenfranchised if I wasn&#x27;t in the fast moving world of ML with where peer review is like playing a slot machine except bigger schools and big labs get access to slot machines with higher payout rates (I see no quality difference between works from different institutions, rather the arxiv wave primes reviewers or language&#x2F;proprietary {models,datasets} also prime reviewers).I actually want people to feel disenfranchised at this point though. Because if there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned, it&#x27;s that we don&#x27;t fix things before they break or even when they are noticeably broken. Rather we fix things when they&#x27;re so broken that they&#x27;re unusable, and typically only fix to minimal usability. Which is such a waste of resources. Maintenance is far cheaper. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentprevA bunch of this is just...wrong.\"- Graduate students (in this setting) are typically funded, so the cost of their credits (often higher than undergrads) are determined by the university and such costs are a major factor of what is taken out of the grant the professor gets their portion (sometimes after the uni&#x27;s cut!). The rest then goes to the student&#x27;s salary and hopefully some left over for new lab equipment.\"There are a number of ways to cover students - TAships, university level scholarships, and grant funding.

It is better to buy shitty lab equipment because you don&#x27;t have enough for good equipment and can&#x27;t invest any excess (even if by being spartan elsewhere).

The cluster nodes and servers I bought for my first project are still running, and indeed go in applications for new grants as equipments I have, in a section often titled \"Facilities and Equipment\".As for not spending it out in time, there&#x27;s what&#x27;s called a \"No Cost Extension\", which is \"Hey, we didn&#x27;t spend the money in time, can we have a bit more time?\". The NSF grants the first one of these automatically, and one grant I&#x27;m on is on it&#x27;s third (a program office has been very understanding about the difficulties of conducting research in hospitals during a pandemic).I&#x27;ve never had pushback from a program for getting an NCE unless it was genuinely something where we messed up spending somehow.\"- A funded graduate student is considered 49% employee and 51% student.\"Nope, they&#x27;re 100% students.

(This is what&#x27;s supposed to happen)\"When my students are \"on approach\" they see me and their committee more and more. They&#x27;re just expected to drive those meetings more as well.\"- When a graduate student stops taking classes they still pay for credits and at the same rate (albeit through funding, which they are often writing for at this point. But prof gets the award).\"Again, this is simply incorrect.\"- Universities pay students and professors to publish papers and judge success by publication in venues\"Perhaps in the most abstract sense, in that scholarship is a metric by which I was judged for tenure and promotion, and without that, I don&#x27;t have a job and thus am not paid. But there has never been a \"paper bounty\" or something like that for any position I&#x27;ve been in.Venues do matter, and some places are cutthroat about it, but other places aren&#x27;t. In my department for example, publications that are in respectable journals appropriate for your discipline will carry you all the way to full professor.\"- Students and professors \"judge\" works submitted to venues by other students and professors for no pay (i.e. on university time)\"I consider this part of my service obligation, and indeed when filling out annual reports and the like, list reviewerships and editorial positions.The rest of your stuff on publication is actually refreshingly correct.\"- Promotions are given to those who&#x27;s name is on the most works, regardless of position or contribution to that work.\"I sit on my college&#x27;s tenure and promotion committee.

We look at the difference between solo and co-authored papers, where a particular individual is on a paper and the balance between first, last and middle authorships (I&#x27;m in a field that doesn&#x27;t alphabetize). We also consider whether someone is expected to be there, or is anticipated to contribute a lot to work that others will end up being the lead for (as a modeler, this is occasionally the position I&#x27;m in).Then there&#x27;s positions that give considerably more weight to teaching or service. reply ModernMech 5 hours agorootparentprev>- Graduate students in year 3+ (median 5 years for PhD) are not taking courses and doing full time research and likely being a TA at the same time.

Many Ph.D.s are supported by grants, and their tuition is covered and is not taxed. That doesn&#x27;t mean the tuition has no value, nor that money isn&#x27;t exchanged to pay for that tuition. Real money is used to pay for that, and it provides a number of benefits to the student including access to the campus and all associated resources (libraries, gyms, labs, events, technology, workspaces, etc.)People working at McDonalds don&#x27;t have access to those resources from their job, so it&#x27;s unfair to not include that when calculating their total compensation. When you do, they come out a lot better than low level drug dealers, as this article tries to argue.It goes on to argue how graduate students are precariously employed. Quite the opposite, Ph.D. students are usually funded for 3-4 years under a grant. At least in the US, I don&#x27;t know of many other jobs with guaranteed 4 year contracts, especially entry level. Most places are at-will and you can be fired on the spot. Ph.D. students are regarded as students, and therefore often aren&#x27;t fired when they make mistakes (even big ones), because it&#x27;s expected that their role is to learn.That&#x27;s another thing, is that this article focuses primarily on how the Ph.D. student is shortchanged by not being paid (in dollars) as much as a low-level employee at a corporation, but it doesn&#x27;t spend any time on how such employees have different expectations. Ask a Ph.D. student if they want more money, and they say \"Hell yes!\" tell them they have to wear a uniform and arrive at 7:00am to open the lab, and they&#x27;re fired if they&#x27;re late twice, and every second of their day will be scheduled and tracked, they will be suddenly less enthusiastic at the prospect of making a couple extra bucks. reply GabeIsko 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a weird chicken and egg scenario, isn&#x27;t it? Grants should really be going to universities that have the equipment to do proper research. Universities rely on grants to fund their operations and lab maintenance.

Additionally, there is public pressure to reduce government spending to lower taxes for private companies - who themselves are also slashing RnD budgets unless they can get a grant. reply stavros 15 hours agorootparentprevAhh I see what you mean, thanks for explaining. reply burnished 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not an expert so a pinch of salt is warranted but:When you give some one money with legally recognized conditions then the organization has to honor those conditions. e.g donate money to a charity and tell them that it is to be used purchasing pens then that is all that money can be used for.So if I understand correctly the &#x27;scheme&#x27; here is that Lab A applies for and receives a grant that has stipulation X. As part of this process a portion of that grant goes to the hosting university without that stipulation. The university is free to spend that money however they wish, including providing some funds to Lab A for things that they really need but were not provided for under the grant. reply HansHamster 15 hours agorootparentprevThe grant has restrictions on how the money can be used and the university takes a sizeable chunk of this (because they can). Then out of generosity and the pure kindness of their heart they might give you back a small chunk of that sum without the same restrictions. reply johnvaluk 13 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t fair. Researchers put an extraordinary burden on administration in an academic institution.

I attempted to work with a university, because like most grants, never available without an academic tie-in. In a pithy way, the only individual grants are mostly NEA&#x2F;NEH grants about writing books about writing books (also applied for those).The university I worked with had a 40+% overhead rate auto-included. This could not be negotiated. If you want to work with us, we add this amount to our Govt. request.The university added a lot of extra work because of this. I basically brought them a proposal, I literally walked over to their partnership office and said \"I&#x27;ve written a proposal I&#x27;d like to work with you on.\" It was mostly written, and said I think \"some number\" would be reasonable. They said, we don&#x27;t apply without 40+% overhead, rewrite the whole grant so it works with our overhead and faculty tie-in requirements. I said that seems very large, and then none of the other numbers work. They said, write with 40+%.The eventual result was that the university wanted me to work as a sub-contractor being paid less than a different contractor they were going to hire as a specialist, so I could have the pleasure of partnering with them.Also, it needs to be completed a month before the deadline, because then all our internals need to churn over the money numbers (and predictably came back a check mark). I was glad it lost. reply robwwilliams 9 hours agorootparentprevWhy obscene? Is rent obscene. Building, supporting, and growing research space does have expenses.

Some are \"safe\" and some are more out there. A typical \"safe\" area is usually running some very expensive piece of equipment (like a mass spectrometer or something) b&#x2F;c that automatically generates collaborations and gets your name on lots of papers. You need to mix and match and use the safer work to fund your more experimental ideas. They also basically never do too much research themselves. They will dip in and give suggestions and guidance and help out, but their primary role is to teach and act as a lab manager - directing students and postdocs to different areas of research. So in a way, if you&#x27;re being a professor and personally deeply involved in the research, then you&#x27;re \"doing it wrong\".On a high level, at least from these popsci descriptions of her work, it kinda feels like Katalin Karikó was just not doing the professor role correctly? The fact she was working on this one problem (and seemingly nothing else?) is very surprising for a professor. Professors aren&#x27;t just tenured post-docs. If you don&#x27;t want to be a lab manager then I don&#x27;t think being a professor is the job for you reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentThere are professors that choose to go this route.

That means you really need to bootstrap to have already run enough of the experiment that you know where it&#x27;s going to go, before you write the grant for the money to run the experiment (and analyze the results, write papers, pay grad students, etc). You also need the money to run enough of the experiments for the new proposals you&#x27;re going to write next so that they are \"successful\". Running experiments and not getting interesting results will lead to not getting future grants, because those handing out money have memories.Second thing. The best way to get tenure is to have such a huge group working for you (e.g. 30 grad students), because the provost will be terrified there isn&#x27;t room for other grant writers in the department to get the money to support them and the lab you&#x27;ve built. Of course managing this is such a full time job before even teaching, that you&#x27;ll be totally overwhelmed and delegating almost all of the research, papers, and grant writing to senior students. Once you get tenure you can slim back down to about 5 students.Also, if you come from a national lab or somewhere that gives you experience writing proposals (and preferably reviewing them) that is a huge advantage since you know exactly what the other reviewers are looking for. Once you write successful proposals and papers, you&#x27;ll be invited to the committees and review other papers for important journals in your field. Of course a lot of this is again a bootstrap and treadmill problem. reply godelski 7 hours agorootparent> Second thing. The best way to get tenure is to have such a huge group working for you (e.g. 30 grad students), because the provost will be terrified there isn&#x27;t room for other grant writers in the department to get the money to support them and the lab you&#x27;ve built.There&#x27;s another factor too. More students means more papers and your h-index goes up. Were we to suppose that all students were equal and that there is a noise associated with the likelihood of publication and another noise with the number of citations then if either of those noise variables are large, you should maximize quantity over quality. Because you&#x27;re simply increasing the odds that you&#x27;ll hit a jackpot.In fact, if you pull the data from csrankings.org you&#x27;ll find that the first 30 (all I pulled because I&#x27;m lazy and not a web person) school&#x27;s rank is practically a function of the number of publishing professors at that university. So the \"more workers = more better\" tactic actually scales from lab to department. If we look a little harder, I think we can all see the limitation of the metrics being used here and why they&#x27;re so easy to hack. More importantly, why these metrics result in a dominating momentum force (aka. rich get richer). Maybe we should start reevaluating how we are evaluating systems. After all, it is neither fair nor an efficient usage of resources. If we&#x27;re going to continue the trend though, the only solution is to allocate more resources... (which to be fair the pool of available resources is increasing year over year, but the allocation isn&#x27;t) reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentprevSitting on our tenure and promotion committee, I&#x27;d be extremely skeptical about someone having 30 graduate students doing a good job supervising them, and we consider having a lab of 3-5 students to be fairly productive for a pre-tenure faculty member.I think the causation is reversed - if you&#x27;re successful enough at writing grants, which involves convincing your peers that your research is that good, to support 30 graduate students, you&#x27;ve already met the qualifications for tenure which involves convincing your peers that your research is good enough to want you in their department for as long as possible.Personally, my work load is worse post-tenure. reply WalterBright 14 hours agoparentprevThis is hilarious.

A Nobel prize comes from one great discovery. An academic career comes from ongoing successful grant applications. reply Kye 16 hours agoparentprevWas it always like this or headed here? I&#x27;m curious if flat government funding for research against rising costs creates or amplifies counterproductive incentives. reply godelski 15 hours agorootparentA little of both. The problem is that evaluation of research work is insanely difficult. A lot of people think it&#x27;s easy because \"the world is objective, it either works or doesn&#x27;t\" but research is cutting edge and you&#x27;re only chipping away at a much larger picture. It can take decades for a work to reveal itself as truly profound or utter shit. The problem, which I rant about in a longer comment, is that instead of acknowledging the noise we&#x27;ve embraced poor metrics and encouraged the hacking of those metrics. I call this Goodhart&#x27;s Hell. People forget, metrics are models and all models are wrong. You have to constantly be questioning your metrics and determine how well aligned they are with your goals or else you&#x27;ll drift (the environment moves, so your metric must move too).I think actually the better way to solve this, which may seem paradoxical, is to actually increase funding. Not in size of single prizes for grants (well... we need that too, but that&#x27;s another discussion), but in the availability. The reason being that the hacking is partially encouraged by the competition for a very scarce resource. A resource that compounds. Due to this (and some nuances, see other post) we&#x27;re not actually rewarding those who perform the best work (we may actually be discouraging that) but those who become lucky. A \"good work\" is simply one with high citation counts, which is heavily weighted on the publicity around that work. Which is why top universities have big media departments, pay news publishers to advertise their works, and why survey papers generate huge counts.The problem is that the system is rather complex and there are no simple or \"obvious\" solutions. \"Good enough\" is also not clear because too low order of an approximation can actually take you away from your intended goals, not a small step towards as one might think. reply blululu 10 hours agorootparentWe have been increasing funding for 50 years and the problem has not been fixed. America currently sets the record in science funding (in raw amount and percentage of gdp) for any society in History and it seems to have these issues. Even if increasing funding would solve the problem, it is, at best, a short term fix. So long as there is growth in the system you can hide a lot of blight and rot. There is enough to go around so the zero sum bad actors don’t take the full pie. But the long problem with such a solution is that you cannot increase funding indefinitely. At somepoint there is a limit to how much money society can allocate to these projects. We need to make our spending work properly. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentWe have been increasing funding in some ways. But, for example, the amount for a non-modular NIH R01 hasn&#x27;t changed since the Clinton administration. A lot of individual grants are just as much work as they have been, more competitive, but pays for less science. reply caddemon 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah any increase in funding needs to go to meaningfully different grant processes. Giving more money to the existing funding structures will not fix a damn thing. Because the present system is just woefully unscaleable. More money to current NIH -> more PhD students -> tenure track competition remains fucking ridiculous. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentprevAny source of funding will spawn an industry designed around extracting every dollar from it. reply godelski 13 hours agorootparentExactly. Or equally: money can only exchange hands by means of a leaky bucket. But I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s not a big problem that the bucket is leaky. Goodhart&#x27;s Hell is when that extraction industry dominates or that bucket isn&#x27;t so much leaky as it is missing the bottom which differentiates it from a tube. Some people call this peak capitalism and it&#x27;s right to complain, but I think this happens in whatever system you use, just exhibits itself in whatever metric dominates (in our case capital&#x2F;dollars.

Not just for academia, even for open source. I can donate to the FSF, but if I want more people improving&#x2F;maintaining emacs or vim and those people get paid for it, that&#x27;s probably not the way, as the FSF does not do this sort of thing, I believe. reply Fomite 3 hours agorootparentA couple things:1) You can actively just donate money to a professor&#x27;s lab. You cannot usual direct what they do with it, because that&#x27;s a grant (or contract), but if you just think Professor X does amazing work, you can give them money.2) There are tons of existing non-profits that do this. My department, for example, was founded thanks to the generous donations of two non-profits.3) A key that HN always forgets (or doesn&#x27;t know about) with overhead is that if a funder pre-specifies that they&#x27;ll only pay X for overhead, the university will almost always accept that. Now it hurts a lot when it&#x27;s 0%, and I actually object when people do that because overhead pays for things needed in research, and at my university that&#x27;s essentially saying \"I&#x27;m donating this, but the taxpayers of $State will pick up the rest\", but we regularly accept grants for very low levels of indirects.You just have to state it in advance.4) You could also endow a chair if you wanted to make sure that University X always has someone working on Y supported with your money, if you&#x27;ve got enough. reply zamfi 6 hours agorootparentprev> I cannot just go and give Professor X $10K to do this research and claim a tax writeoff.You absolutely can. These are called “gifts”. Typically, the overhead rate is very low (~10%?) and they are tax deductible as a charitable contribution.That said, you don’t then get to say “do this research” directly. (That’s called a “directed research” grant and comes with a higher overhead.) But you would basically only give money to a lab that’s already doing research you find interesting — and of course you can talk to them about the research you’d want them to do, this distinction just refers to whether there’s a contract for specific research activities or not. reply ChuckMcM 9 hours agorootparentprevSetting up a non-profit is not that difficult[1], especially if you&#x27;re doing educational work vs say politics or NGO type work. You start with a \"regular\" LLC company, and then ask the IRS to certify it as a non-profit. An attorney that has done this before can probably set it up for $10 - $15K, less if they give you the friends and family rate. You could make it an S-corp which is a bit more complicated and might cost more, and for this purpose would be overkill.Generating a grant is harder. I went through that process when I was working with IBM to fund some research at CU Boulder on machine learning work that was aligned with IBM&#x27;s Watson research at the time. As the comment lower down in this thread indicates the University sets its own rules and takes its own share of any monies \"donated\" for research. The person you want to talk to is the University President and then probably the Provost. The President can point you to the right person and see that they are willing to take a meeting with you about your proposed grant. My experience is that professors will be very enthusiastic the University somewhat more reserved. My experience with CU Boulder was that the politics were pretty intense&#x2F;petty[2]My take was that the net amounts end up needing like 3x that is base grant to get what you want to give the professor something. Numbers that are still in the noise for very high net worth individuals but a barrier for less endowed individuals. The good news is that your non-profit can run fundraisers and bring in donations that you then funnel to research. This was something suggested to me as a way some people want to fund something but want to put a bit of space publicly between them and the funding. The non-profit has to report who donated (over say $5000) and how they spent their money, but it doesn&#x27;t have to \"connect the dots\" directly so to speak.[1] I happen to be the Treasurer of one which gave me an opportunity to see how they work in California and what&#x27;s involved in doing the taxes :-)[2] Silly example, the Department Chair was blocking any grant for an Associate Professor in the department unless it included a separate grant for a different professor in the department. reply golem14 3 hours agorootparentYeah, isn&#x27;t that crazy? 3x overhead?

That is negotiated between the school and the grant org. For the NIH, it averages fifty percent. The school&#x2F;university is very restricted in what they can bill a lab for; for example, I worked somewhere that we couldn&#x27;t charge for storage because that would have violated NIH&#x27;s rules on double-billing, because the storage cluster was paid for via administrative overhead.Chances are when someone says \"I got a $1M grant to study bubblegum&#x27;s effects on the gall bladder\", they actually got $1M plus another $500,000.Second, that money isn&#x27;t being greedily stolen. That overhead help pays for, directly or indirectly, things like (notice I said \"like\", because I am not an expert in the exact rules around what can and cannot be paid for via overhead):* the building* the real estate the building sits on* the utilities to keep the building lit and comfortable (which in the case of life&#x2F;bio&#x2F;chemistry sciences can be an enormous challenge given how much airflow lab space needs, which is far greater than office airflow...and then there&#x27;s biosafety &#x2F; chemical hoods)* security, both equipment and staff (which can be substantial if the university or school does biomedical research in any sensitive areas such as stem cells, animal research, infectious disease, etc). This includes monitoring for equipment failure (for example, sample storage systems often have dry contact alarm hookups so that if they fail, security or facilities finds out ASAP and can alert people)* the utilities to power equipment, such as -80 freezers (just one of which can use more energy than a US household)...most of us would also go pale if we saw the power bill for some physics labs) and other \"utilities\" like vacuum, purified water, etc.* construction, maintenance, cleaning...both staff and supplies* grounds maintenance, everything from mowing the lawn to leaf and snow removal* technology costs - telephone and networking infrastructure and staff, server admins for everything from websites to email to storage to computational clusters, desktop support staff* business administration, which includes, but is a lot more than just, payroll&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;HR. Grant writing&#x2F;administration is often its own entire department, because you need people who not only know how to submit the paperwork, but frankly, also follow faculty around badgering them to fix or submit paperwork on time - faculty are incredibly lazy about this.* all the services the lab&#x27;s grad students, staff, postdocs, and faculty use and don&#x27;t think anything about, like shuttle busses, the library, and so on. reply PheonixPharts 15 hours agorootparentRegarding your first point, was the parent comment edited or did you miss this part as they clearly address this issue:> (50-100%! btw this doubles the \"cost\" of the grant, it doesn&#x27;t lessen the amount the professor gets).Parent comment isn&#x27;t making the claim that \"schools are greedily taking away poor Petey PhD&#x27;s hard-earned grant money.\"Rather bemoaning the fact that academic success (and even entry into the field at all) is very, very closely tied to the ability to generate revenue and more so the corollary that quality of research performed always at best takes a back seat, or at worst becomes a liability if it gets in the way of bringing in more money. reply bachmeier 15 hours agorootparentI think they were probably replying to exmadscientist, not thelittlenag. reply WoodenChair 7 hours agorootparentprev> First off: grants from most places factor in the administrative overhead.

Is it not in men&#x27;s nature to pursue education, or is it merely not risky enough?And supposing that 60&#x2F;40 split is evidence of systemic sexism towards men, what do you make of the 40&#x2F;60 split in the opposite direction when you look at tenured professors? reply leereeves 4 minutes agorootparent> what do you make of the 40&#x2F;60 split in the opposite direction when you look at tenured professors?A legacy of systemic sexism from the time when those tenured professors were in school.The split is 50&#x2F;50 among all professors.etrautmann 14 hours agoparentprevUnless the organization is fundamentally structured with difference incentives, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll achieve a different outcome.It&#x27;s a hard but necessary challenge to prioritize research, which requires that every research group advocate the utility of their work and be evaluated in comparison with others. reply ip26 8 hours agorootparentI agree, the funding model would have to be different.I think there may actually some schools that already do it, but you don’t hear about them much because the research-funded model ultimately drives prestige.

I&#x27;m talking about research.I&#x27;m saying, can we create a research university that would displace Harvard, MIT, etc. by allowing our brightest researchers to actually do fundamental research instead of churn out incremental grants? Even the smartest people (who are, without a doubt, at MIT and such places) seem to have a hard time just actually pursuing research. Especially research that is not legible to the byzantine bureaucracy of Academia (tm). Increasingly it seems that it&#x27;s despite these institutions that good research gets done, not because of them.Teaching is another matter as well and is certainly related.

Basically academia is now ruled by the same rotten economic lenses as the rest of the economy.

It&#x27;s really hopeless how this economic virus infects every little corner of our world and turns it to shit.This isn&#x27;t just one story, there are countless other researchers and even life-saving drugs that are not developed purely because of this mindset.

In academia it is the worst of both worlds. You need to be a start up hype man type (or something adjacent anyway) to get the grants, but you only need to deliver a paper at the end - not an actually functional product or organization. So we do not see the same upside that a market driven approach might have for eventually finding a stable state, only the downside of being ruthlessly metric driven. reply contemporary343 13 hours agoprevSome of this is universal, but much of her story is particular to how US med schools operate: their research faculty tend to be largely soft money in nature, so grant money is even more necessary than in other &#x27;hard money&#x27; jobs in non-med school fields. Such a system is destined to fail when geniuses like Kariko pursue risky new territory for which large grants are hard to secure.The really distasteful thing here is Penn as an institution. They have reaped the benefits of her work in terms of mRNA patent royalties (a very large number I believe), and of course reputationally. Yet, they treated her truly terribly and have never - and it seems like will never - acknowledge it.

    "originBody": "CORY ZUE Home Projects Writing On Software Open Project Dashboard About The Slow Death of Authenticity in an Attention Economy Why I've gotten more and more pessimistic about my relationship with Twitter. Oct 27, 2023 How I wish people used Twitter versus how they seem to be doing it lately. I’m not quite sure when I started feeling uncomfortable with Twitter.1 It wasn’t when Elon Musk bought it, or during the mass firings, or the bluecheck fiasco, or the rebrand to X, or any of the other politically-obvious times that many people decided to give up on it. No, I was a Twitter optimist for a long time. But somehow, somewhere over the last few months, my positive outlook on the platform has slowly eroded away. As I—ironically—spend as much time as ever scrolling through my feed—I find myself more and more annoyed, jealous, outraged, yes, but mostly just… bored. And what’s funny is that the content is more “engaging” than ever. My feed is full of posts that have obviously had more effort put into it than most of what I used to see. Megathreads about AI, thoughtful, longform narratives that could have been blog posts, carefully curated images, and super-positive business updates. It’s mostly engaging stuff. And therein, I think, lies the problem. The content I now see on Twitter is content that has been designed to be seen on Twitter. Tweeting has become a job. Quite literally, for many people, ever since they’ve started paying creators a share of ad revenue. And yes, on the surface this incentivizes people to create better content. The better your content is, the more it gets seen, and the more money you make. And yet, my felt experience of this change is the exact opposite—as people seek more engagement, their content gets worse. What’s going on here? One possibility is that I am unusual. I go on Twitter for authenticity. I have carefully curated a list of human beings who I know by name, and whose ideas and actions interest me. But authenticity is often at odds with growth. Why? Well to grow you need to be noticed. To be noticed, you need to stand out. And to stand out is—usually—inauthentic. Yes, we all say and do noteworthy things, but not every day. To do or say noteworthy things every day involves some degree of forcedness, repetition, or trying. The opposite of authenticity. If I wanted to get 10x more engagement than usual on a Tweet tomorrow, I could. I could post some celebratory brag about how much money I’m earning from my businesses (“omg $10k MRR!”). I could pick a fight on a topic people feel strongly about (“React sucks!”). I could mention it’s my birthday and post a picture of myself (“Can’t believe I’m 41!”).2 I could ask a question that lets people promote themselves (“What’s your favorite personal website?”), angrily quote-tweet a terrible take, and so on. I know these things work. And I occasionally do them, knowing they will work. I try to do this only a handful of times a year, because even though they work, and even though they are useful for me and my businesses, and even though they make my lizard brain feel good, a part of me still hates them. Even a few times a year. Clearly I’ve been wrestling with this issue for a little while now. But oh boy, not the people in my feed. The people in my feed—most of whom I’m not following, by the way—love posting for engagement. Some of them love it so much that they offer courses teaching other people how to do it—which amplifies this godforsaken death spiral even further. And so now we find ourselves in a situation where all these asshats with 20k followers and a Stripe account are now running their Twitter account as a business. And this has led to a slow and inevitable decline from authenticity to some version of marketing (look at my content!) and sales (follow me!). What we are witnessing now is the professionalization of Twitter. And look, I don’t think it’s just the algorithm and the incentives. Elon’s political antics chased away a lot of good people. Many of my favorite follows have moved to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky.3 Also, more and more people are waking up and realizing that social media is actually quite bad for you, and leaving it behind. Good for them. Bad for me.4 Still—and quite ironically—if anything actually gets me to stop using this platform, it’s going to be the changes that are supposed to make it grow.

A decade ago the common adivce for how to connect with people - Tweet often, comment often, follow accounts - connected you with a lot of people, and you would often end up following each other.I started a new account recently (hadn’t used my old one in years), and doing so now got me just about zero attention. I got zero followers from comments, posts I made, following others, etc. It was like shouting in an empty room. Of course, there were ways to “increase engagement” that I tried and they did increase my follower account - but to what end? At that point it just feels like a weird game where everyone is trying to scam each other.I tried another social media app recently, and was surprised to find it was like how Twitter used to be. When I followed people, a bunch of people followed me back. A bunch of people reached out to me, so that even though I haven’t put _any_ effort into engagement so far, I’ve made a lot of connections. People there are one social media to be, well, social. On Twitter, it feels like a mercenary game of “What can this person do for me?”&#x2F;“How can I trick this person into making them think I’ll make them rich&#x2F;healthy&#x2F;wealthy&#x2F;successful.” reply passion__desire 18 hours agoparentDo you really want to be friends with 8 billion people? Let&#x27;s say you want to be friends with only 500 of them. How should those 500 be selected out of people who see your tweets? It has become a norm in social media, only real-life friends follow you on social media if you are not a famous person, otherwise its a suspicious behaviour. People can have a transient meaningful conversation in the comments section, never to see each other again.My school teacher jokingly gave a small scenario, he said \"Imagine you know everyone in the city, you have to say hi or atleast nod to everyone. Not doing it would be to acknowledge you don&#x27;t care for them.\" reply TheRealDunkirk 19 hours agoparentprev> I started a new account recently (hadn’t used my old one in years), and doing so now got me just about zero attention.

I&#x27;ve run my own experiment by paying for a couple months, then letting the subscription lapse, and repeating. I&#x27;ve been through 3 cycles. My conclusion is that if you don&#x27;t pay, you don&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;m currently not paying, and I don&#x27;t see doing so any more. Even if I do pay, I have no desire -- and nothing particular to leverage -- to build a serious \"presence,\" so I will always be just another nobody spitting in the wind. reply SkyMarshal 17 hours agoparentprevThe comment quality standards required for people to reply and&#x2F;or follow you are higher now. Tweeting often is useless if you have nothing really substantial to say. There are millions of accounts that do that, and they’re mostly noise disguised as signal, but most of the Twitter community has caught on and now auto-filters it out. You’ve gotta get through that auto-filter now with information or insights of substance, and those simply take longer and more effort to generate, there’s no silver bullet. reply bnralt 15 hours agorootparentI’ve found the opposite to be the case myself. When I was only posting substantive Tweets with new info, they wouldn’t be seen 99% of the time. But every so often a Tweet would get seen, gain some traction, be retweeted, people would say it was amazing. And I’d get zero new followers. Like I said, I did find ways to get new followers - but it was through gaming the system.And this is something I see a lot. There are a ton of accounts that have less than 100 followers that only do substantive Tweets. And the people who keep rehashing the same clickbait have huge followings. Even most of the relatively substantive large accounts spend a ton of time rephrasing Tweets they’ve made before. A high volume mediocre account that games the system somewhat is going to be a lot bigger than an account that only Tweets&#x2F;comments when they have something substantive to say, at least in my experience. reply watwut 15 hours agorootparentprev> comment quality standards required for people to reply and&#x2F;or follow you are higher nowI really do not find this to be true. The high ones are from blue checks and overwhelming majority of them has no meaning. I do not even mean insulting or something I disagree with, they just don&#x27;t say anything.There are very few real responses now and majority of what I see excluding the above are knee jerks super short responses. reply coldtea 11 hours agoparentprev>I started a new account recently (hadn’t used my old one in years), and doing so now got me just about zero attention. I got zero followers from comments, posts I made, following others, etc.Not sure if that&#x27;s because of some recent change.Many people had the same experience also back a decade ago (and in between). Just because they adviced to \"tweet often, comment often, follow accounts\" it didn&#x27;t mean this guaranteed followers, it was just the bare minimum required to be able to get any.On platforms with much less users (like some \"federated\" replacements) this is often not the case - connections are more easily made there, but I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s always the case when a social network is much smaller and people try to \"build up\" their circles (as opposed to when they&#x27;re spoilled for choice). reply stolenmerch 16 hours agoparentprevI think it may have a lot to do with the Twitter subcultures and communities you are following.

On the other hand there are other places like \"Finance X\" or \"Sports X\" where you get deep dives about the state of that space from various people.Moving away from X&#x2F;Twitter, there&#x27;s tons of \"authentic\" content you can find on Youtube, a recent favorite of mine has been watching Peter Santenello[1]. He could be considered a journalist and his whole thing is just going into random communities and talking to people.

This sort of gruff fatigue is what seems to set in on very large, cacophonous social networks.I also find Youtube to be a lot healthier, probably because not everyone is incentivized to have an opinion, and it&#x27;s quite easy to ignore the Comments section.

Do we even see authenticity in public? Any awareness that we are being observed introduces some amount of Hawthorne effect. Probably the most genuine folks are the introverts and socially averse.Regional burns are espoused to celebrate \"radical self-expression\" , and unlike the Big Burn, their smaller size seems to promote authenticity to a greater degree. But even there, people are doing bits or acting out a persona or even just socially experimenting.Authenticity itself is nebulous. But even taking that into account, there are definitely more harmful and less harmful facades. We pay actors and performers to be inauthentic. But we consider influencer \"fake\".Point is, I don&#x27;t think \"authenticity\" is the main metric we actually care about. Inauthenticity can be lots of fun for all parties. It&#x27;s the motivations of the act. It&#x27;s the second-order authenticity. An actor is authentic in their inauthenticity: there&#x27;s no hiding that they are putting on an act. But we dislike influencers and the like because while they are (often obviously) inauthentic, they try to hide that fact under a facade trying to make it seem like it&#x27;s their \"real expression\".As a counterpoint, take a youtuber I really enjoy, Ryan McBeth. He does OSINT mostly military-themed current events vids and blogs. I&#x27;m sure the Ryan in front of the camera is different than the Ryan I&#x27;d meet at the bar: more polished, calculated in choice of words, presenting self in the best light, because that&#x27;s what we all do in the limelight. But he totally lampshades his sponsored bits: \"let me take a few moments to pay the bills\". That&#x27;s the second-order authenticity. Doing a paid sponsor bit is ipso facto inauthentic - it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d do without the influence of money. But lampshading it tips his hand and humanizes him. Or does it?Maybe he&#x27;s saying that because his shtick is \"down to earth authentic guy\" and that&#x27;s what that character would say?

If you were authentic enough to truly believe in what you say, then paying $8&#x2F;mo is a great investment to get your message out and have a more official platform.

Where the honesty (and the authenticity) comes into play is where who you are now is who you are representing.As for selecting and deselecting traits I don&#x27;t think this is inauthentic. It&#x27;s normal, actually, in that people do this to create connections. I like to think of it like a handshake. We each kind of discuss things we like, we eventually arrive in some consistent state, and now we&#x27;re \"connected\". We are still authentic (in that we are still honest) but we have selected certain traits of ours that are similar enough to foster a relationship. Of course, the inauthentic person can exploit this by just replaying back what they hear. This usually doesn&#x27;t last long though. Someone too similar also raises red flags. An authentic person, IMO, will present with things you like and things you don&#x27;t like. The balance of that is what makes the relationship between the two.

Just the opposite.Which article would you click on to read - \"More and more Americans sink into poverty\"? - \"Trump and Biden have food fight at restaurant?\".And Twitter takes this even further. `if isdemocrat title = \"trump throws food at biden?\" if isrepublican title = \"biden throws food at trump?\" if istrump title = \"lock em up\"It is actually worse than that, because the clicks are then used to sell you a bill of goods.

Look at facebook. reply PaulHoule 19 hours agoprevSomething on my mind is how to build a non-toxic engagement model and I am finally getting a clear picture of how to do it.You can make a pretty good engagement model for Hacker News based on headlines by filtering for posts with > 10 votes and predicting the ratio of comments to votes. The trouble is that \"high engagement\" posts are frequently clickbait.I suspect that the trending toots on mastodon.social right now are about a person who got elected to the Speaker of the House who I&#x27;d like to call a \"clown\" but that would be an insult to clowns so I won&#x27;t. If a trained a model to maximize boosts and favorites I&#x27;d create a monster (e.g. if the US was truly a \"democracy\" today we&#x27;d write a constitution enshrining a one-party state, the only disagreement is which party it would be) I know though that I get really good engagements on (low-effort) pictures of flowers that I post as opposed to the sports photos I take which I work really hard at it. That is, there are paths to high engagement that aren&#x27;t toxic, a model just has to be trained to reward them.In either case it would take developing a training set of a few thousand non-toxic but high engagement posts, it&#x27;s probably easier to do that for HN than it is to do it for Mastodon. reply AraceliHarker 19 hours agoparentIt is no secret that Japan already has a website called GIGAZINE that brazenly translates and monetizes stories from Hacker News, often without regard for copyright law.

I could never imagine how that would make me smarter, wiser, or better informed. I could see how it would help me waste a lot of time, sure.

In a good town square, you have people minding their own business and the public activities are actually curated(a few agendas that fit in the physical location) and people visit those if they they are interested in.However, maybe it is a town square but a bad one. Bad town squares are places where everyone tries to sell you something or make you do something and there are plenty of crazy people trying to grab attention and do things you would rather not see.My \"for you\" tab is filled with \"ChatGPT is great but you are not using it right\" posts that look like copycats, the only organic looking content is from anti-vaxxers and all kind of conspiracy theorists and fascist(maybe because ChatGPT refuses to generate such content, therefore the only organic content is that one). Oh an that is organic but not really authentic, that is it is not independent thinkers but solders of a cult or a movement that keep repeating same talking points.On the other hand, Twitter has become a better product overall thanks to making some stuff like lists more prominent so you have some tools to avoid the crazy town. However, the problem is that even the curated lists are not immune because now the people in those lists are incentivised to grab as much as attention as possible so they can monetise it. Thece are courses and tools made to optimize for that so the content becomes \"made for Twitter to boost engagement\". Youtube also has it but maybe of the higher production costs and longer to consume content format, a race to the bottom hasn&#x27;t happen as dramatically. They still can get good engagement by creating higher quality videos.So what about actual people who don&#x27;t produce content professionally? The actual authentic content?

If the platform were like traditional media, there would be a lump at the right. As things were, the lump was moving slowly towards the right.The problem was not that footballers and models don’t make good content — they do. The problem is that if you see that, you don’t post.

Link at bottom.> But a strange thing has occurred with the rise of social media: many people are reverting back to a mechanism of identity formation that resembles sincerity, a mechanism of identity formation which Hans-Georg Moeller and Paul D’Ambrosio in You and Your Profile, have termed profilicity. Like sincerity, profilicity is other-directed and reliant on the reactions of an audience. With sincerity one’s family and community are the audience that casts judgement on how sincerely, or properly, one plays the pre-determined roles. With profilicity the audience is a generalized peer group consisting of hundreds, thousands or even millions of social media users and this audience plays a somewhat different role than under sincerity: not only does the audience judge the identity one forms, but it also helps shape the very roles one strives to play. For profilicty entails creating profiles on social media through the selective display of pictures and other bits of information, or in a more passive manner merely observing the profiles of admired personalities, and then using these idealized profiles as roles to play in real life. Or as Jeremy Weissman explains in The Crowdsourced Panopticon:“. . . a simultaneous exchange occurs between the two entities, our digital [profiles] and our in-real-life self. As we broadcast idealized portraits of our in-real-life self online, we then in turn adjust our in-real-life self so as to meet with popular approval when we are broadcast online again. At a certain point, our in-real-life self and digital [profiles] practically merge.”Jeremy Weissman, The Crowdsourced Panopticon Forming an identity through the mechanism of profilicity has serious drawbacks. Firstly, it promotes an unhealthy degree of conformity. For to succeed in the world of social media is to conform as a successful profile is measured by metrics such as likes, shares and follows. But profilicity necessitates not just conforming to the preferences of one’s peer group, but also conforming to the standards set by those who manipulate the algorithms of social media, or as Weissman writes:“Through the ever-increasing gaze of a pervasive audience online, we may become overly pressured, even coerced toward collective opinion, as social media’s mechanism of likes, dislikes, friends, and followers constantly subjects us to the crowd’s judgment along with that gaze.”Jeremy Weissman, The Crowdsourced Panopticon By promoting a hyper-conformity, profilicty limits our potential as the generalized peer group of social media users, and the manipulators of social media algorithms, have no interest in many elements that comprise a healthy sense of self. With profilicity if we step too far out of line, if we are too unique, or if our value system diverges too far from what is deemed acceptable, we will be shunned, shamed and ostracized. Appearances, superficialities, and adhering to the values of popular culture are what matter with profilicity, not cultivating a harmonized mind, a healthy body and a fulfilling life. What is more if we live in a sick society, this sickness will be embodied in the preferences of the generalized peer group and so in seeking validation of this crowd, and embodying their preferences, we lock ourselves into a sick sense of self.“Once we give up our true self to play a role, we are fated to be rejected because we have already rejected ourselves. Yet we will struggle to make the role more successful, hoping to overcome our fate but finding ourselves more enmeshed in it. We are caught in a vicious cycle that keeps closing in, diminishing our life and being.”Alexander Lowen, Fear of LifeContinued:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academyofideas.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;social-media-why-it-sicke... reply swayvil 17 hours agoprevWhenever I see \"X\" (twitter) I think of the x in the corner of a window, for closing the window.

What’s going on here?It always tickles me when terminally online people realize that human connection doesn&#x27;t scale.

The encyclopedia Brittanica didn&#x27;t establish a human connection, but it was a valuable resource. An ugly problem with an attention economy is that you are rewarded for seeming useful and interesting, but once the attention has been given, there is no incentive to actually deliver. So we get clickbait headlines and veneer-grade content because that&#x27;s enough to get the ad dollars, without the investment that original content would require.To be fair, most web users are happy with the arrangement - they get an endless feed of free tiny doses of dopamine while they avoid the real responsibilities of life.

There is reverse sort of meme, where non-natives are celebrated for writing perfect English.

With that in mind, the popularity of low-effort, high-dopamine entertainment doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply that most people are simple-minded and just like this - the alternative hypothesis is that they just don&#x27;t have time and energy for any more complex, richer ways of spending their time. reply feoren 18 hours agorootparentprev> half of \"the people\" are dumber, more simpler-minded than the average person.Spiders Georg would like a word with you.

But if you&#x27;re living in California, it is easy to miss because EVERYTHING is much more expensive.2) Mileage is generally poorer, due to the mandatory ethanol mixes. But some places also usually mix in ethanol, and the difference is usually in the 10-15% range. So unless you have a good A&#x2F;B comparison going, it&#x27;s also easy for it to blend in with all the stop and go driving, and terrible road conditions.3) Mandatory Ethanol means generally very poor storage characteristics. Which considering how much driving happens in California (and how dry the climate is in the populated areas), most people won&#x27;t notice.So does it suck? Comparatively, definitely! Is it likely to be noticed unless you&#x27;re very aware and have experience with other options? Nope. reply aifooh7Keew6xoo 7 hours agorootparentI understand that additionally in some vehicles (not necessarily aircraft) predating ethanol dilution the evap systems may begin to malfunction at high elevation and temperature due to the lower initial boiling point of ethanol.In the case of my vehicle it results in low&#x2F;rough idle and positive fuel tank pressure which otherwise do not occur either at lower elevation or with ethanol-free fuel at elevation. reply technothrasher 15 hours agorootparentprevOnce you&#x27;ve replaced those valve seats with hardened ones, you don&#x27;t have to worry about adding lead substitute in every fill up. You do still have to worry about getting the right oil additives though, as the old flat tappet engines need more zinc than modern oil blends have in them. Ethanol in the gas is also a concern, but any conscientious classic car owner has hopefully replaced all the rubber and plastic bits in the fuel system to ethanol safe ones. reply Gibbon1 14 hours agorootparentI think (don&#x27;t really know) alloy steel valves and hardened seat were pioneered by the aircraft industry and appeared in cars by the 1950&#x27;s. So really lead wasn&#x27;t needed to extend the life of valves after that. Also my experience with some shitty 1960&#x27;s cars was the valve guides would wear out before the seats. Compression is fine but engine burns oil and fouls the plugs. You could see it with older cars when going downhill, they&#x27;d be blowing oil smoke. reply jabl 15 hours agorootparentprev> The 75+ heads, all have steel seats.No idea about 240z specifically, but at least things designed for sustained high performance (like aero engines) tend to use valve seats made from some wear and temperature resistant alloy like stellite or brightray. reply sokoloff 12 hours agorootparentprevLegally, they need to run a fuel which is approved on the type certificate data sheet for their engine (and the engine-airframe combination).The recently developed G100UL unleaded fuel requires a change to the type certificate of the airplane (by serial number) and engine(s) (by serial number) to be legal.Until that supplemental type certificate existed, these airplanes did legally need leaded fuel. reply kube-system 12 hours agorootparentI am aware, and was presuming that to be covered by the> Once it&#x27;s legalexception above. reply lfuller 18 hours agorootparentprevG100UL, the current unleaded alternative to 100LL, has been tested to act as a drop-in replacement for any and all aircraft engines that run on 100LL.If you can run, 100LL, you can run G100UL. The main issue is with mogas (standard car gas) - many aviation engines can&#x27;t run it. reply nativeit 13 hours agorootparentI would imagine that the gelling problems ethanol can sometimes cause in automobiles is magnified when used for aircraft due to the thermal dynamics present in aviation (the temperature drop while in-flight) that aren’t a factor for most automobiles. That’s just my intuition, I’m sure there are better informed people here who know better. reply imoverclocked 12 hours agorootparentYup, also, there are specific chemistries used in some composite wet-wing designs that can be damaged by ethanol. It&#x27;s the final reason I became less interested in the DarkAero 1 while following its development. reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentprevIs that due to the Ethanol fraction or some other factor? reply labcomputer 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s part of it. Ethanol is incompatible with materials commonly found in airplane fuel systems.Another aspect is that many piston airplane engines need high octane because they have relatively high compression ratios: WWII era engines need 130 octane to develop full horsepower (they can be operated at reduced manifold pressure on currently available 100 low-lead gas), and even many post-war civilian engines require 100 octane.Still another aspect is that the FAA is relatively conservative and doesn&#x27;t want to approve something that might lead to, for example, vapor lock or fuel freezing issues. reply mrguyorama 13 hours agorootparent>airplane engines need high octane because they have relatively high compression ratios: WWII era engines need 130 octane to develop full horsepowerI mean, high octane and compression relative to other 1960s engines. The common engines in nearly any single prop cessna have about a 9:1 compression ratio, which was massive back when it was built, but laughably bad compared to anything manufactured after the advent of Fuel injection and better piston geometry.Modern cars regularly have over 12-1 compression ratios on 87 octane.1960s era carbs and top ends were just abysmal and did a terrible job of mixing the fuel and air charge and controlling the flame front, because we just didn&#x27;t have the kinds of computer controls and fluid dynamic simulations we have now, to dynamically prevent knock.Rotax engines are modern and can reach identical performance figures or better, with the same weight or lighter, simply by using modern techniques like fuel injection or a small turbocharger. They do this while running on 91 octane reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentExcept none of that can be used until someone goes through the millions of dollars to do all the design work, safety testing, and mountains of FAA paperwork.

Then you have to add some paperwork to the logbook and POH and add placards to the fuel fillers and cockpit.In theory you should be able to automatically get it for anything which was approved from the factory to use 100LL, but the STC application form (here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stc.g100ul.com&#x2F;aircraft&#x2F;) does not allow you to select most mid-century large radials (which were usually originally certified on 130) or the airplanes they were installed on.To be clear, this is a great thing, but you can&#x27;t legally just fill G100UL in any random airplane. reply briandear 15 hours agorootparentExactly.

Markets can solve externalities, through market transactions that shift ownership so that the externalities are internalized. The main thing preventing this is government regulation that raises transaction costs so that the necessary adjustments cannot be made. This has been known at least since Ronald Coase published his famous theorem.In other words, government regulators prevent markets from solving externalities, and then complain that markets can&#x27;t solve externalities so government regulators have to step in.It&#x27;s true that there are cases where there are no market transactions that can internalize an externality. But in those cases, regulation can&#x27;t solve them either; there are no solutions for such cases.

For example, we didn&#x27;t realize until 2020 that 6PPD - already toxic to many aquatic organisms - can oxidize become 6PPD-quinone, which is acutely toxic to coho salmon and some other fish species. This solved a 20 year old mystery of so many coho salmon died after a rain storm.That&#x27;s why the California Environmental Protection Agency has passed a rule requiring tire makers to declare an alternative by 2024. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dtsc.ca.gov&#x2F;scp&#x2F;motor_vehicle_tires_containing_6ppd&#x2F;That&#x27;s in addition to the particulate pollution from tire wear.

Which vary. The engines may get rebuilt, but without a very expensive type change and approval (often from the manufacturer) they’re the same design as the original. Which has the same limitations.So until there is a viable authorized replacement (per the FAA), literally they can’t use it except in emergencies. Which only just became available. And they can’t change engines either. And they can’t just YOLO it legally.Because fuel is a major cause of crashes that kill people already (usually contamination, or wrong fuel causing engine failures&#x2F;flameouts).And despite the FAA knowing of the risks of lead (or more precisely, knowing the various factors), they only recently did authorize a replacement.So it’s as if that study on those plastics happened 30 years ago, and we’re just now getting around to it. Which essentially is what has happened with cars and the various pollution.So raking anyone over the coals when a far larger, more damaging, and widespread crisis has always been going on for even longer and gets ignored?

This reduces engine knock, which makes the engine live longer, also allows pushing more fuel into a cylinder per ignition cycle more confidently.These things are possible without lead as well, it just costs more money to do so. reply labcomputer 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s about increasing the compression ratio without self-ignition. High compression ratios mean higher power for the same weight, and airplanes are all about minimizing weight. You also get higher efficiency. Again, lower fuel weight = good.You can dump as much fuel in the cylinder as you want (in fact, most airplane operating handbooks call for a very rich mixture on takeoff because of the cooling effect). reply inoffensivename 18 hours agoparentprevIt allows the fuel to withstand higher pressures without detonating in an uncontrolled manner. This is important in aircraft engines, which run at a significant fraction of their maximum power output for most of their working lives.People have been looking for alternatives for a long time, but it&#x27;s difficult because leaded aviation gasoline is not a very large market, and there are substantial regulatory obstacles. reply amarshall 18 hours agoparentprevIncreases octane rating, that being is necessary to prevent engine knocking at higher engine compression ratios. reply lawlessone 18 hours agorootparentSo higher octane means it needs higher temp&#x2F; pressure to burn?

It always annoyed me when old (20-30 years ago) Shell gas commercials would imply that high-octane (read: much higher profit margin) gasoline would cause your engine to make more power. Now, they didn’t actually say that outright, because it’s not true.[0] But if you put Shell gasoline in your car, you were told that you’d “feel the power your car is capable of”, or some weasely bullshit. The word “power” was used a lot in that commercial, just never next to the word “more”.I was a professional mechanic around that time, and I had coworkers that thought that not only would high-octane gas give more power, would also swear it increased fuel mileage. Neither is true. High-octane fuel has less energy per gallon than lower octane fuel, it can’t give better mileage.

I&#x27;ll add what I know. \"Octane\" can be thought of as \"Resistance To Pre-ignition\" where the higher the octane number, the more resistant the fuel mixture is to ignition&#x2F;burning. Lower octane fuel can have a tendency to pre-ignite via cylinder compression (compression on the upstroke raises cylinder temperatures to the point of combustion) rather than ignite when the spark plug fires. This is whats called \"knocking\" as in the benign case it cause the engine to make a knocky-rattling sound ( not unlike a diesel which in fact relies on compression ignition as a feature of its design ). In the bad case, pre-ignition can cause catastrophic engine damage where engines \"grenade\" themselves.More or less, if you want to build a light weight&#x2F;high power engine you want a higher compression ratio. As the piston travels upward on the compression stroke higher pressures are achieved and this allows designers to take advantage of different crank&#x2F;cylinder characteristics to make more power in a smaller, lighter package.We used lead in car gas because engine timing technology and fuel delivery technology were analog&#x2F;mechanical and really very limited in terms of tuning potential. The cheap hack was just to use a fuel that was more resistant to burning in the first place. Just add a hotter spark&#x2F;ignition system and it was good to go design wise. Given the old tech running in most GA planes, this was a natural thing to do at the time and the problem was well understood. To point here, modern non-lead additives have been around for a long time and the problem can be adequately solved with a non-lead substitute.If you wanna get deep with this, take your old normally aspirated car and bolt a turbo on it! reply neuralspark 18 hours agorootparentprevWell, it can brrr faster because the fuel is detonating only when the plugs fire so the timing can be better controlled. reply savrajsingh 18 hours agoparentprevAllows higher compression of the fuel before it combusts. watch this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA reply gwbas1c 14 hours agoparentprevOne thing to add: There was a focus on patenting an additive so that the manufacturer could get royalties.(In comparison, it was well-known at the time that ethanol can also increase octane, and it wasn&#x27;t protected by patents.) reply jcampbell1 18 hours agoparentprevHalf the story is the lead acts as a octane booster, but raising the octane without lead chemicals is trivial.

The specification for most airplane engines say \"100LL\" and the specification for 100LL is a composition specification (ASTM D 910), not a performance specification.If your fuel meets ASTM D 910, it contains lead. If it doesn&#x27;t contain lead, it doesn&#x27;t meet ASTM D 910 and therefore definitionally isn&#x27;t 100LL, so if your engine type certificate data sheet calls for 100LL, it unavoidably calls for lead.If you are flying an aircraft that is thus-certified, flying it with a different fuel is, per the FAA definition in 14CFR3.5, flying an unairworthy airplane.\"Airworthy means the aircraft conforms to its type design and is in a condition for safe operation.\"That&#x27;s the legal reasoning that the Gami STC is required: to change the TCDS of the engine and airframe to permit a fuel other than 100LL and still be considered airworthy.

The problem, of course, is that G100UL isn&#x27;t really available anywhere yet, while 100LL is still ubiquitous. reply Reason077 17 hours agorootparentprev> \"For many (maybe even most, but I don&#x27;t know the exact numbers) certified aircraft there is no legal path to get it to run on any other type of fuel.\"Until recently this was true. But since September 2022, G100UL is legal and certified for \"every spark ignition piston engine and every airframe using a spark ignition piston engine in the FAA’s Type Certificate database.” reply NelsonMinar 17 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re right, some GA engines use fuel injection, also a 1950s technology. I used to fly a Cardinal with Lycoming IO-360. We got the fancy GAMIjectors and it made a huge improvement. Yes, the big exciting 2000s technology was \"the holes in the injector are sized to provide calibrated fuel flow\".While I&#x27;m rambling, the dual spark in a GA engine is really interesting. reply elzbardico 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, I understand using leaded gas in older designs. But what was the manufacturer&#x27;s excuse to keep designing engines that require leaded gas even on fuel-injected, ECU equipped newer designs?Not a rhetorical question, I am genuinely curious. reply tass 17 hours agorootparentNew and old designs have been tested and can work with unleaded fuel. (Edit: there are surely some exceptions here, so I don’t mean this to be all encompassing)New designs must work with leaded fuel since that is the fuel which is available - until avgas contains no lead this will continue to be the case.Side note, most new planes are sold without an ecu. reply dontlaugh 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are 100 RON fuels without lead. reply jabl 14 hours agorootparentSure there are, but the 100 in 100 octane avgas refers to MON, not RON. 100 MON fuel is a bit trickier to be done without lead, although we now have G100UL which does it. reply sojournerc 18 hours agoparentprevNot all planes, just older ICE powered prop planes.Jets (and turbo-props) run on kerosene basically.The lead is an additive that acts as a lubricant and older engines aren&#x27;t certified to run without it. reply pc86 18 hours agorootparent\"older ICE powered prop planes\" in this context means any prop plane, and about 95% of those used for GA. Brand new ones require leaded gasoline as well because with the exception of fuel injection the engine designs are basically identical to those 50s and 60s era planes. reply sojournerc 18 hours agorootparentBeing pedantic, but turbo-prop planes use a jet engine to turn the propeller, and so use jet fuel.That&#x27;s going to be bigger twins and prop planes like the Pilatus reply froggit 16 hours agorootparentBeing more pedantic, turboprops use gas turbine engines to power the propeller. \"Jet engine\" is incorrect when referring to gas turbine engine other than turbojets, such as turboprops, turbofans and turboshafts. Turbojets were the first variant of gas turbine engine to be put into use so \"jet engine\" ended up being used as a common term. Modern \"jet planes\" often use turbofans for their greater efficiency at similar performance levels, but \"fan plane\" sounds silly. The M1 Abrams uses a turboshaft engine but I&#x27;ve never heard it called a \"jet tank\" (which sounds badass). reply sojournerc 16 hours agorootparentI appreciate the double pedantry.I should&#x27;ve known intuitively that a turboprop isn&#x27;t a jet engine because the thrust comes from the prop not the exhaust. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentUnrelated pedantry - even still, significant thrust does come from the jet engine. 5-10% typically. reply Reason077 17 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t require leaded gasoline, they require 100-octane gasoline. It&#x27;s just that until recently, a certified, unleaded 100-octane avgas did not exist. reply ledauphin 18 hours agorootparentprevit&#x27;s not actually primarily a lubricant, it&#x27;s an octane-increaser (detonation reducer) reply sojournerc 18 hours agorootparentIIUC, it&#x27;s both, but you&#x27;re right lubrication is not it&#x27;s primary purpose, but I think the reason leaded fuel is hard to replace is that the lubricating properties are difficult to replicate.> wherein it served as an effective antiknock agent and reduced exhaust valve and valve seat wear.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tetraethyllead reply jabl 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s mostly an issue on cheap engines without hardened valve seats. Aviation engines switched to hardened valve seats well before WWII. reply some_random 18 hours agoparentprevUntil very recently, you legally weren&#x27;t allowed to fly most GA aircraft on anything other than 100LL. Thank the FAA for dragging their feet on certifying a replacement. reply foxyv 18 hours agoparentprevNot much thankfully. It&#x27;s only small General Aviation piston aircraft and there aren&#x27;t many of them relatively speaking. It&#x27;s not like in the 60s when there were thousands of car engines per city constantly pumping it out. More like 10-20.This is why the FAA wasn&#x27;t in a huge hurry but at the same time they were WAY too slow. It should have been a crash priority honestly. reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s likely that every kilogram of lead you atomize into the air has a far worse impact on people and the environment than a kilo of lead in, for example, electronics, paint, or flashing.Increased lead in crops grown within a few miles of airports has been noticed.[1].As had reduced IQ&#x27;s in children living near airports. [2][1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.ac.uk&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;344932499.pdf[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2353962-children-living... reply foxyv 18 hours agorootparentYeah, they should have ended 100LL a long long time ago. It&#x27;s crazy how such a small amount can cause so many problems. Imagine what it was like back in the 60s. Utter insanity and they KNEW that it would cause problems. reply londons_explore 17 hours agorootparentUnfortunately there is growing evidence that lead stays in soils for decades or maybe centuries. I can imagine in the future that lead contamination of farmland might mean that we end up with a kinda crazy reversal - we end up growing all our food in undeveloped places like south america that never had as much lead contamination, and food from the USA and other developed countries is so lead contaminated that it gets exported to places like africa where they don&#x27;t have strict regulations against contaminated food. reply foxyv 15 hours agorootparentUndeveloped countries stopped using lead way after the USA. Lead contamination was a huge issue in Africa and the Middle East. It wasn&#x27;t until 2014 that lead use in auto fuel was ended worldwide.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;africa&#x2F;2053227&#x2F;leaded-gasoline-is-now-banned-...Luckily lead is very heavy and chemically active which makes it much easier to remove from soils than some of the nastier contaminants. You can essentially break it down with sulphur amendments to acidify the soil and then let the plants do the rest of the work. Eventually dilution does the rest of the work until it reaches background levels. reply elzbardico 17 hours agorootparentprevNot likely as we stopped pumping lead into the atmosphere some decades ago. Things are not going to get worse on this. reply londons_explore 16 hours agorootparentNo, but our understanding of &#x27;acceptable&#x27; lead levels keeps getting lower. One day, the amount of lead in our crops which we might today consider acceptable, in the future we might not.Imagine if 100 years from now, Brazil is an up and coming economic powerhouse, and economists figure out that they are doing so well because their strategists, businesspeople, scientists and engineers are all smarter because their food contains less lead than ours does. We&#x27;d quickly start outlawing high lead food, which in turn might make big swathes of our cropland unusable for food. replyrtkwe 18 hours agoparentprevYes and there&#x27;s some areas near popular flight schools with significantly elevated lead levels because there are constantly planes flying overhead using leaded Avgas. It was a special carveout because recertifying every engine that was designed to use leaded gas is a pretty big lift and has significantly higher safety implications when the engine is in a plane instead of a car. It is only for some types of engines but those are more common on the older more affordable planes. reply nonsense123 18 hours agorootparent> recertifying every engine that was designed to use leaded gas is a pretty big lift ... instead of a carWrong on all accounts. There are orders of magnitude less engine models used in air than cars. Profit margin for airplane companies are higher than cars (though volume is much lower). cars use the same model worldwide and pass certification all at once, planes sell in one country and customers are mostly responsible for &#x27;acclimatization&#x27; or whatever they call it in your parts, but it usually is about lights color and placements or some nonsense.the one thing that made planes be so slow, is that people who own planes have much more voice over legislation than people who own cars. Nothing else. That&#x27;s why the whole industry used tax payer money to certify one special new gas type that will work on all existing engines (again, possible because much less variety, making it easier technically). You breathed lead for 60 years of legal lethargy just so a few people didn&#x27;t have to spend a few pennies on their plane maintenance. reply rtkwe 18 hours agorootparentIf a car engine fails or is suffering more long term damage due to knocking the car doesn&#x27;t have an immediate emergency on the same order of magnitude a plane does. A failed plane engine is an immediate life threatening emergency to everyone on board. reply elzbardico 17 hours agorootparentNot only on board.I thanks the FAA and other&#x27;s countries flight authorities for the fact that I don&#x27;t need to have an anxiety crisis every time a plane passes overhead. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentprevWhile there are fewer models, the amount of paperwork per model is orders of magnitude higher. And many of the manufacturers for the most common models no longer exist in the form they were when the engines and planes were originally designed and certified.Oh, and unlike with a car or truck, engine failure in a light plane, especially during takeoff, is VERY likely to result in death or serious injury. reply Filligree 18 hours agorootparentprev> higher safety implicationsWell, what are the safety implications of atomizing lead? This argument seems short-sighted. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentPretty low. Even in the highest risk populations (children in very close proximity to piston aircraft airports), less than 5% of the body lead burden can be attributed to that source. I linked to the NIH study elsewhere in here.It&#x27;s notable, and is being banned for it. But when it&#x27;s gone, it won&#x27;t make any significant difference. reply stouset 17 hours agorootparentprevLook, nobody is defending the FAA on this. GA pilots have wanted this for decades.There was a carve out because plane engines are expensive and old (the most common engine today is a 50 year old model). Presumably it was expected that carve out would just be temporary while we worked on finding an off ramp to unleaded avgas. Nobody wanted the FAA to just ignore the problem for decades. reply rtkwe 17 hours agorootparentprevFor the public it&#x27;s a relatively minor issue except where you have both high levels of traffic and low level flights of the kinds of planes that use leaded av gas. Without that combination the effect on real gas levels are minor. Ideally we have no lead emissions of course but the effects are tiny if you don&#x27;t have those two factors. reply c4mpute 18 hours agoparentprevDouble or triple that of a car, for a small plane, because of the higher fuel consumption.But this only affects avgas, which is high-octane gasoline for propeller-driven aircraft. Jet-A1, which is light diesel fuel or kerosene-like for jets doesn&#x27;t contain lead. reply m0shen 18 hours agoparentprevNot all. Jet fuel doesn&#x27;t have lead. AFAIK it&#x27;s piston based small planes. reply s17n 18 hours agoparentprev> How much environmental lead contamination are we talking here?Not much. Flying is a pretty niche hobby (and as others have pointed out, commercial jets don&#x27;t use leaded fuel). reply miguelazo 17 hours agorootparentIn some areas, especially highly populated areas like Southern California, it is far from a \"niche hobby\". reply t90fan 17 hours agoparentprev> wasn’t leaded gas banned in the 70s?Don&#x27;t know about the US, but we had leaded petrol (gas) for cars much later here in the UK, ~2000 at least. I remember my mum&#x27;s Austin Metro (which was from the early 90s&#x2F;late 80s) ran on it, and we only replaced that car once I was in high school (and that was in 2001) reply codexb 18 hours agoparentprevNo, commercial airplanes all use unleaded jet fuel. But the small, 2 and 4 seater general aviation planes you see are almost all using 60-year old engine designs that run on leaded fuel because the FAA doesn&#x27;t want to devote time to approving new engines for general aviation. reply shrubble 16 hours agoparentprevSince according to another post in this thread, 11000 barrels of leaded are produced each day, vs 4.9 million barrels of diesel fuel seem to be the numbers, not a huge amount. However it is still good that the law now allows unleaded. reply uoaei 18 hours agoparentprevConcentrated near takeoff and approach paths of small airports servicing small aircraft.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;2158594&#x2F;do-you-live-near-enough-to-a-small-ai... reply pc86 18 hours agorootparentCan anyone get this page to work?

It’s a shame it’s taken this long. And it’s a shame there are folk here defending leaded fuel. reply froggit 16 hours agorootparentPretty sure no one&#x27;s defending it, just explaining why it stuck around. It seems pretty unanimous \"spraying lead everywhere is bad so leaded fuel is bad.\" reply stouset 17 hours agorootparentprevNobody as far as I can tell is defending leaded fuel. Just explaining why there was initially a carve out. Having that carve out made sense at the time. Having it last until 2023 is malpractice. reply bigmattystyles 17 hours agoparentprevIs that also in what I’m breathing in when I fly commercial? reply gnicholas 17 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re in a jet, no (they use jet fuel). reply renewiltord 18 hours agoparentprevSafety regulations are written in blood. There should be a long and careful process before any so-called improvements from modern technology are forced upon us. In making new kinds of gasoline, chemical engineers should really consider safety and ethics. And every one of them should first be required to study the humanities. reply phkahler 18 hours agorootparent>> There should be a long and careful process before any so-called improvements from modern technology are forced upon us.In this case, it has been a decades long process. But it&#x27;s done now and the replacement fuel is available. Time to mandate the change. reply renewiltord 17 hours agorootparentStop making guinea pigs out of normal people. Gasoline is a volatile substance. Just changing it willy-nilly without extensive testing is unethical. There&#x27;s a reason the FAA hasn&#x27;t certified it.

OK, got it Site Reliability Engineering Home Books Resources Careers SRE in Cloud Prodcast Lessons Learned from Twenty Years of Site Reliability Engineering Or, Eleven things we have learned as Site Reliability Engineers at Google Authors Adrienne Walcer, Kavita Guliani, Mikel Ward, Sunny Hsiao, and Vrai Stacey Contributors Ali Biber, Guy Nadler, Luisa Fearnside, Thomas Holdschick, and Trevor Mattson-Hamilton Foreword A lot can happen in twenty years, especially when you're busy growing. Two decades ago, Google had a pair of small datacenters, each housing a few thousand servers, connected in a ring by a pair of 2.4G network links. We ran our private cloud (though we didn't call it that at the time) using Python scripts such as \"Assigner\" and \"Autoreplacer\" and \"Babysitter\" which operated on config files full of individual server names. We had a small database of the machines (MDB) which helped keep information about individual servers organized and durable. Our small team of engineers used scripts and configs to solve some common problems automatically, and to reduce the manual labor required to manage our little fleet of servers. Time passed, Google's users came for the search and stayed for the free GB of Gmail, and our fleet and network grew with it. Today, in terms of computing power, we are over 1,000 times as large as we were 20 years ago; in network, over 10,000 times as large, and we spend far less effort per server than we used to while enjoying much better reliability from our service stack. Our tools have evolved from a collection of Python scripts, to integrated ecosystems of services, to a unified platform which offers reliability by default. And our understanding of the problems and failure modes of distributed systems also evolved, as we experienced new classes of outages. We created the Wheel of Misfortune, we wrote Service Best Practices guides, we published Google's Greatest Hits, and today are delighted to present: Lessons learned from two decades of Site Reliability Engineering Let's start back in 2016, when YouTube was offering your favorite videos such as \"Carpool Karaoke with Adele\" and the ever-catchy \"Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.\" YouTube experienced a fifteen-minute global outage, due to a bug in YouTube's distributed memory caching system, disrupting YouTube's ability to serve videos. Here are three lessons we learned from this incident. 1 The riskiness of a mitigation should scale with the severity of the outage There's a meme where one person posts a picture of a spider seen in their house, and the captain says, \"TIME 2 MOVE 2 A NEW HOUSE!\". The joke is that the incident (seeing a scary spider) would be responded to with a severe mitigation (abandon your current home and move to a new one). We, here in SRE, have had some interesting experiences in choosing a mitigation with more risks than the outage it's meant to resolve. During the aforementioned YouTube outage, a risky load-shedding process didn't fix the outage... it instead created a cascading failure. We learned the hard way that during an incident, we should monitor and evaluate the severity of the situation and choose a mitigation path whose riskiness is appropriate for that severity. In a best case scenario, a risky mitigation resolves an outage. In a worst case scenario, the risky mitigation misfires and the outage is prolonged by something that was intended to fix it. Additionally, if everything is broken, you can make an informed decision to bypass standard procedures. 2 Recovery mechanisms should be fully tested before an emergency An emergency fire evacuation in a tall city building is a terrible opportunity to use a ladder for the first time. Similarly, an outage is a terrible opportunity to try a risky load-shedding process for the first time. To keep your cool during a high-risk and high-stress situation, it's important to practice recovery mechanisms and mitigations beforehand and verify that: they'll do what you need them to do you know how to do them Testing recovery mechanisms has a fun side effect of reducing the risk of performing some of these actions. Since this messy outage, we've doubled down on testing. 3 Canary all changes At one point, we wanted to push a caching configuration change. We were pretty sure that it would not lead to anything bad. But pretty sure is not 100% sure. Turns out, caching was a pretty critical feature for YouTube, and the config change had some unintended consequences that fully hobbled the service for 13 minutes. Had we canaried those global changes with a progressive rollout strategy, this outage could have been curbed before it had global impact. Read more about the canary strategy in this paper, and learn more in this video. Around the same timeframe, YouTube's slightly younger sibling, Google Calendar, also experienced an outage which serves as the backdrop for the next two lessons. 4 Have a \"Big Red Button\" A \"Big Red Button\" is a unique but highly practical safety feature: it should kick off a simple, easy-to-trigger action that reverts whatever triggered the undesirable state to (ideally) shut down whatever's happening. \"Big Red Buttons\" come in many shapes and sizes—and it's important to identify what those big red buttons might be before you submit a potentially risky action. We once narrowly missed a major outage because the engineer who submitted the would-be-triggering change unplugged their desktop computer before the change could propagate. So when planning your major rollouts, consider What is my big red button? Ensure every service dependency has a \"big red button\" to exercise in an emergency. See \"Generic Mitigations\" for more! 5 Unit tests alone are not enough - integration testing is also needed Ahh.... unit tests. They verify that an individual component can perform the way we need it to. Unit tests have intentionally limited scope, and are super helpful, but they also don't fully replicate the runtime environment and productionized demands that might exist. For this reason, we are big advocates of integration testing! We can use integration tests to verify that jobs and tasks can perform a cold start. Will things work the way we want them to? Will components work together the way we want them too? Will these components successfully create the system we want them to? This lesson was learned during a Calendar outage in which our testing didn't follow the same path as real use, resulting in plenty of testing... that didn't help us assess how a change would perform in reality. Shifting to an incident that happened in February 2017, we find our next two lessons. First, unavailable OAuth tokens caused millions of users to be logged out of devices and services, and 32,000 OnHub and Google WiFi devices to perform a factory reset. Manual account recovery claims jumped by 10x because of failed logins. It took Google about 12 hours to fully recover from the outage. 6 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS! AND BACKUP CHANNELS!! AND BACKUPS FOR THOSE BACKUP CHANNELS!!! Yes, it was a bad time. You want to know what made it worse? Teams were expecting to be able to use Google Hangouts and Google Meet to manage the incident. But when 350M users were logged out of their devices and services... relying on these Google services was, in retrospect, kind of a bad call. Ensure that you have non-dependent backup communication channels, and that you have tested them. Then, the same 2017 incident led us to better understand graceful degradation: 7 Intentionally degrade performance modes It's easy to think of availability as either \"fully up\" or \"fully down\" ... but being able to offer a continuous minimum functionality with a degraded performance mode helps to offer a more consistent user experience. So we've built degraded performance modes carefully and intentionally—so during rough patches, it might not even be user-visible (it might be happening right now!). Services should degrade gracefully and continue to function under exceptional circumstances. This next lesson is a recommendation to ensure that your last-line-of-defense system works as expected in extreme scenarios, such as natural disasters or cyber attacks, that result in loss of productivity or service availability. 8 Test for Disaster resilience Besides unit testing and integration testing, there are other types of very important testing: disaster resilience and recovery testing. While resilience testing verifies that your service or system could survive in the event of faults, latency, or disruptions, recovery testing verifies that your service can transition back to homeostasis after a full shutdown. Both should be critical pieces of your business continuity strategy—as described in \"Weathering the Unexpected\". A useful activity can also be sitting your team down and working through how some of these scenarios could theoretically play out—tabletop game style. This can also be a fun opportunity to explore those terrifying \"What Ifs\", for example, \"What if part of your network connectivity gets shut down unexpectedly?\". 9 Automate your mitigations In March of 2023, a near-simultaneous failure of multiple networking devices occurred in a few datacenters, resulting in a widespread packet loss. In this 6-day outage, an estimated 70% of services experienced varied levels of impact, depending on the location, service load, and configuration at the time of network failure. In such instances, you can reduce your mean time to resolution (MTTR), by automating mitigating measures done by hand. If there's a clear signal that a particular failure is occurring, then why can't that mitigation be kicked off in an automated way? Sometimes it is better to use an automated mitigation first and save the root-causing for after user impact has been avoided. 10 Reduce the time between rollouts, to decrease the likelihood of the rollout going wrong In March of 2022, a widespread outage in the payments system prevented customers from completing transactions, resulting in the Pokémon GO community day being postponed. The cause was the removal of a single database field, which should have been safe as all uses of that field were removed from the code beforehand. Unfortunately, a slow rollout cadence of one part of the system meant that the field was still being used by the live system. Having long delays between rollouts, especially in complex, multiple component systems, makes it extremely difficult to reason out the safety of a particular change. Frequent rollouts—with the proper testing in place— lead to fewer surprises from this class of failure. 11 A single global hardware version is a single point of failure Having only one particular model of device to perform a critical function can make for simpler operations and maintenance. However, it means that if that model turns out to have a problem, that critical function is no longer being performed. This happened in March 2020 when a networking device that had an undiscovered zero-day bug, encountered a change in traffic patterns that triggered that bug. As the same model and version of the device was being used across the network, a substantial regional outage ensued. What prevented this from being a total outage was the presence of multiple network backbones that allowed high-priority traffic to be routed via a still working alternative. Latent bugs in critical infrastructure can lurk undetected until a seemingly innocuous event triggers them. Maintaining a diverse infrastructure, while incurring costs of its own, can mean the difference between a troublesome outage and a total one. So there you have it!

I don&#x27;t see any \"this would only apply at Google\" in here.> COMMUNICATION CHANNELS! AND BACKUP CHANNELS!! AND BACKUPS FOR THOSE BACKUP CHANNELS!!!Yes! At Netflix, when we picked vendors for systems that we used during an outage, we always had to make sure they were not on AWS. At reddit we had a server in the office with a backup IRC server in case the main one we used was unavailable.And I think Google has a backup IRC server on AWS, but that might just apocryphal.Always good to make sure you have a backup side channel that has as little to do with your infrastructure as possible. reply riwsky 8 hours agoparentGod, I feel like such an idiot. All this time I’ve been making fun of Google for having Google Talk, Hangouts, Allo, Duo, Messages, Spaces, Wave, Buzz, Plus, and Meet, I’d never realized that it’s simply a necessary SRE measure at their scale. reply Jensson 7 hours agorootparentImagine if they accidentally deprecated their last messaging service? Can&#x27;t let that happen so better build some extra just in case. reply fragmede 12 hours agoparentprevThe ultimate in \"this would only apply at Google\", was having to establish backup communication side channels that weren&#x27;t Google dependent. While on call as an SRE for Google on the Internet traffic team, we would naturally default to Google Meet for communications during an indent, but the questions is, what would we do if Google Meet is down? It&#x27;s a critical-path team, which mean that if I got paged because my team&#x27;s system is down, it&#x27;s not improbable that Google Meet (along with Google.com) was down because of it.We needed to have extra layers of backup communications because the first three layers systems were all also Google properties. That is to say, email wouldn&#x27;t work because Gmail is Google, our work cell phones wouldn&#x27;t work because they&#x27;re Google Fi, and my home&#x27;s ISP was Google Fiber&#x2F;Webpass.All of which is to confirm that, yes, Google has a backup IRC server for communication. I won&#x27;t say where, but it&#x27;s explicitly totally off Google infrastructure for that very reason. reply jeffrallen 12 hours agorootparentHurricane Electric?

When I was there these grand unified base layer systems everything else was built on top of were a point of pride.

Most giant custom-stack companies have circular dependencies on core infrastructure. Software-defined networking needs some software running to start routing packets again, diskless machines need some storage to boot from, authentication services need access to storage to start handing out service credentials to bootstrap secure authz, etc.It&#x27;s currently handled by running many independent regions so that data centers can be brought up from fully dark by bootstrapping them from existing infra. I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone bringing the stack up from a full power-off situation. Even when Facebook completely broke its production network a couple years ago the machines stayed on and running and had some internal connectivity.This matters to everyone because while cloud resources are great at automatic restarts and fault recovery there&#x27;s no guarantee that AWS, GCP, and friends would come back up after, e.g., a massive solar storm that knocks out the grid worldwide for long enough to run the generators down.My guess is that there are some dedicated small DCs with exceptional backup power and the ability to be fully isolated from grid surges (flywheel transformers or similar). reply throwawaaarrgh 13 hours agoparentThe solution to this has to be done earlier, but it&#x27;s simple: start a habit of destroying and recreating everything.

He went on vacation, his credentials aged out, and of crawler stopped refreshing the index.But my favorite incident will forever be the time they had to drill out a safe because they were disaster-testing the password vault system and discovered that the key needed to restore the password vault system was stored in s aafe, the combination for which had been moved into the password vault system. Only with advanced, modern technology can you lock the keys to the safe in the safe itself with so many steps! reply tomcam 15 hours agorootparent> But my favorite incident will forever be the time they had to drill out a safe because they were disaster-testing the password vault systemGreat story to be sure—-but I’m going to call it a success. They did the end-to-end testing and caught it then instead of real life. reply shadowgovt 14 hours agorootparentWell, mostly-kinda-sorta. ;) It&#x27;s the internal password vault, and there&#x27;s only one of them, so it&#x27;s more like \"they broke it on purpose and then had to fix it before the company went off the rails.\" Among the things kept in that vault are credentials that if they age out or aren&#x27;t regularly refreshed, key internal infrastructure starts grinding to a halt.But still, \"it broke while engineers were staring at it and trying to break it\" is a better scenario than \"it broke surprisingly while engineers were trying to do something else.\" reply jrms 18 hours agoparentprevI thought the same. reply jeffbee 12 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a logical consequence of the \"zero trust\" network. If an engineer&#x27;s workstation can make RPCs to production systems, and that engineer is properly entitled to assume some privileged role, then there&#x27;s no difference between running the automation in prod and running it on your workstation. Even at huge scales, shell tools plus RPC client CLIs can contact every machine in the world pretty promptly. reply kevan 5 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s still differences. If you&#x27;re running it in prod then the functionality has at least gone through code review and you have higher confidence what&#x27;s running is what you think it is. If you run things from personal boxes there&#x27;s always the risk of them not having the latest code, having made a local change and not checking it in, or the worst case of a bad actor doing whatever they want with the privileged role. But if code review isn&#x27;t required or engineers have unrestricted SSH access to prod hosts then it&#x27;s pretty much equivalent. reply tiddo_langerak 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;m curious how people approach big red buttons and intentional graceful degradation in practice, and especially how to ensure that these work when the system is experiencing problems.E.g. do you use db-based \"feature flags\"? What do you do then if the DB itself is overloaded, or the API through which you access the DB? Or do you use static startup flags (e.g. env variables)? How do you ensure these get rolled out quickly enough?

At other places I’ve also seen that done with application level flags so you’d do kubectl edit which is obviously less than ideal but worked reply justapassenger 16 hours agoparentprevImplantation details will depend on your stack, but 3 main things I’d keep in mind:1. Keep it simple. No elaborate logic. No complex data stores. Just a simple checking of the flag.2. Do it as close to the source as possible, but have limited trust in your clients - you may have old versions, things not propagating, bugs, etc. So best to have option to degrade both in the client and on the server. If you can do only one, so the server side.3. Real world test! And test often. Don’t trust test environment. Test on real world traffic. Do periodic tests at small scale (like 0.1% of traffic) but also do more full scale tests on a schedule. If you didn’t test it, it won’t work when you need it. If it worked a year ago, it will likely not work now. If it’s not tested, it’ll likely cause more damage than it’ll solve. reply tomcam 15 hours agorootparent4. Document procedures and methodically test the docs as well reply masto 12 hours agoparentprevIt depends.To make up an example that doesn&#x27;t depend on any of those things: imagine that I&#x27;ve added a new feature to Hacker News that allows users to display profile pictures next to their comments. Of course, we have built everything around microservices, so this is implemented by the frontend page generator making a call to the profile service, which does a lookup and responds with the image location. As part of the launch plan, I document the \"big red button\" procedure to follow if my new component is overloading the profile service or image repository: run this command to rate-limit my service&#x27;s outgoing requests at the network layer (probably to 0 in an emergency). It will fail its lookups and the page generator is designed to gracefully degrade by continuing to render the comment text, sans profile photo.(Before anyone hits send on that \"what a stupid way to do X\" reply, please note that this is not an actual design doc, I&#x27;m not giving advice on how to build anything, it&#x27;s just a crayon drawing to illustrate a point) reply anonacct37 13 hours agoparentprevI worked at enough companies to see that many of them have some notion of \"centralized config that&#x27;s rolled to the edge and can be updated at runtime\".I&#x27;ve done this with djb&#x27;s CDB (constant database). But I&#x27;ve seen people poll an API for JSON config files or dbm&#x2F;gdbm&#x2F;Berkeleydb&#x2F;leveldb.This can extend to other big red buttons. It&#x27;s not that elegant but I&#x27;ve had numerous services that checked for the presence of a file to serve health checks. So pulling a node out of load balancer rotation was as easy as creating a file.The idea is that then when there&#x27;s a datab outage the system defaults to serving the last known good config. reply dineshkumar_cs 14 hours agoparentprevVersioning, feature toggle and rollback - automated and implemented at different level based on the system.

It&#x27;s best to keep it simple so that recovery is easy over building out a more complicated solution that is reliable in the average case but fragile in the limits.

Can&#x27;t wait for AI-powered ad blocking. Just imagine it. AI parses content and filters out ads, brands, even subtle PR text from pages automatically. Not just textual content either.

Have the AI watch ads, spoof responses, while we watch ad free content. Run it like SETI, during our devices downtime. They&#x27;ll try to raise fraud concerns. Understandable. Accusations of piracy? Certainly possible. Convictions, though? Probably not. reply akoboldfrying 7 hours agorootparentprevIf AI-powered ad blocking becomes ubiquitous, it will mean the end of high-quality free services like Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Translate and YouTube, for all of which I much prefer to pay with my attention rather than cold, hard cash.I have no doubt that current AI is capable of this (in fact I&#x27;m sure it would be trivial for GPT-3.5 and well within reach of even locally-run LLMs), the question is what fraction of users can be bothered -- and I don&#x27;t see any reason why AI would lead to an increase there. reply hotnfresh 4 hours agorootparentThe end of ad-supported services makes room for open protocols, open source, and regular old commercial software. All of which have suffered from lack of interest—from developers and users—in this environment where they have to compete with “free”. reply akoboldfrying 1 hour agorootparentI agree that that there would be an upswing in those things, but I&#x27;m not at all certain that the resulting environment would be any better for the average user -- certainly not in the short term, while people&#x27;s expectation (which has by now become built into our culture) to get almost anything they want online \"for free\" remains. reply scarface_74 6 hours agorootparentprevThere is no such thing as a high quality ad supported service.

With lying by omission being a close friend. reply akoboldfrying 5 hours agorootparentprevAll of the services I mentioned are either directly (Search) or indirectly ad-supported, the latter insofar as Google pays for their development and upkeep somehow, and most of Google&#x27;s revenue comes from ads. And I think they are all of excellent quality.Ads are irritating, and Google is not supplying these services out of the goodness of their heart, but I think there&#x27;s no question that the world is a better place with these ad-supported services in it. reply mistercheph 5 hours agorootparentI’ll raise the question. reply lelanthran 1 hour agorootparentprev> If AI-powered ad blocking becomes ubiquitous, it will mean the end of high-quality free services like Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Translate and YouTube, for all of which I much prefer to pay with my attention rather than cold, hard cash.That is true, but what is also true is that a few products are currently sucking all of the air out of the system, preventing new entrants from encroaching on the incumbents territory.Maps, Search and Youtube all serve the Google Search business. Any new ad-supported entrant, by necessity, also has to serve the Google Search business.If the Google Search Business is crippled, there are only good things that can result from that. I don&#x27;t see a downside to making Google Search unprofitable due to smart ad-blockers. (I welcome hypothetical scenarios in which the Search Business being limited due to ad-blockers has bad unintended consequences).Unrelated: I don&#x27;t understand why this comment is modded so low that I can barely see it? It is not in any way controversial and can be (and is, above) rationally debated. reply leventonportera 2 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t use google search (most of the time) as it&#x27;s inferior - it ignores what I&#x27;m searching for, and substitutes what it thinks I should be searching for - and it&#x27;s been doing that for years. There were free search engines before there were ads.I don&#x27;t use gmail because why would anyone want to use gmail for anything but temporary throwaways that&#x27;ll get spammed.I don&#x27;t use google maps. nokia heremaps and openstreetmap (I use magic earth) are better in most ways, worse in others. When I go to a different country, I click \"download country\" and have a fully searchable map. No, I don&#x27;t want a map that needs a data connection. No, I don&#x27;t want to have to visually search the map for the thing I&#x27;m looking for, because someone barfed up a salad of dots that are place ads for things unrelated to my search. Google maps is not usable to anyone who has used something else. People who always use google maps don&#x27;t know any better.I do use google translate. This does not support your argument, because that&#x27;s a service that is free, and does not display ads. You saying that the current ad-free service will disappear if ads were blocked from it... Can&#x27;t make the comment on here that I want to make, so I&#x27;ll let you imagine Youtube... Who give a crap. There were sites with videos before, there are other sites now. No, no one can host a huge expensive platform like that for free. So how about the people posting stuff, pay for their stuff being hosted. Then those people can inline talking ads or put a coke can on their desk, in their videos. You know, how ads in videos have been done since the existence of the video format, in 1920 all the way up to right now.Google products, google customer service, and google the company, are inferior to the competition in almost every way. Except for google translate. Which again - has no ads. reply akoboldfrying 2 hours agorootparent>No, I don&#x27;t want a map that needs a data connection.Google Maps has had the ability to download maps for offline use as long as I can remember -- at least since 2013.>This does not support your argument, because that&#x27;s a service that is free, and does not display ads.All Google services are ad-supported, at least indirectly. That&#x27;s because Google pays for their development and upkeep, and Google&#x27;s primary income stream is ads. reply matheusmoreira 7 hours agorootparentprev> it will mean the end of high-quality free servicesSo be it. If those services can&#x27;t survive without ads and surveillance capitalism, they don&#x27;t deserve to exist. reply BoiledCabbage 5 hours agorootparentAn argument I read that has merit is that ad supported services does democratize the web for developing countries.If for example youtube with all of its information or even Google search required a subscription, suddenly a lot of people who make significantly less than the average for the developed world would no longer be able to access those resources.I still hate the ad surveillance everywhere, but it was a point I hadn&#x27;t considered before. reply seanhunter 3 hours agorootparent> An argument I read that has merit is that ad supported services does democratize the web for developing countries.You know who has seeded that argument into the public domain? PR agencies working for the advertising industry. It doesn&#x27;t have any merit whatsoever.

Not this ad-supported nonsense. reply seabass-labrax 2 hours agorootparentI love the concept of advertising-free cities! It&#x27;s actually the advertising situation with public transport that I have found particularly frustrating where I am. For instance, some bus seats have transport maps on the ceiling above them, but others have private advertisements. Likewise, some stations have dozens of electronic advertising boards where they could have timetables. Perhaps they could at least have a button on them to switch them momentarily to a map or timetable.I wonder how many millions of people have missed their train&#x2F;bus connection because they couldn&#x27;t find a departure board among the billboards. reply akoboldfrying 4 hours agorootparentprevI agree, and I think the same argument holds for poor people everywhere, including poor people in developed countries. reply mistercheph 5 hours agorootparentprevWikipedia reply akoboldfrying 7 hours agorootparentprevI guess we disagree on whether advertising goods and services to people should be considered a crime. reply SoftTalker 6 hours agorootparentAdvertising no. Tracking individuals and building profiles about them across the web, much less clear, probably yes. reply akoboldfrying 5 hours agorootparentI feel similarly, though I also think that, provided the intent to track and profile-build is made clear to users up-front before they opt in to using something, the onus shifts to them (the user).(OTOH if that intention is conveyed in p. 37 of an EULA in dense legalese, it seems clearly designed to swamp the user. I&#x27;d like to see a lot more attention paid to this in legal circles.) reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentprevWe do. I think advertising of all kinds should be illegal. I consider it to be a form of mind rape when they forcibly insert their brands and products into my mind without my consent. reply lelanthran 59 minutes agorootparent> I consider it to be a form of mind rape when they forcibly insert their brands and products into my mind without my consent.We aren&#x27;t talking about a Clockwork Orange type of scneario.

And, just as importantly, who do you feel should get to decide in the general case? reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparentNot at all. I draw the line at consent. Nothing wrong with HN showing me your comments. I came here to see comments. If they started showing up while I&#x27;m watching a video somewhere else I would feel violated and swiftly block them. Nothing wrong with showing me products when I open a store app. That&#x27;s what I opened the app to see. Showing me products while I&#x27;m trying to read an article is a violation.Advertising is by definition noise. Superfluous. Information I did not ask for. Irrelevant stuff that someone paid money to put in front of me. Information I explicitly ask for is not advertising, it&#x27;s simply information.My cognitive functions are inalienable, they are not theirs to sell to the highest bidder, nor are they currency to pay for services with. I have attention deficit disorder. It&#x27;s hard enough for me to focus without these corporations trying to grab my attention. I consider their attempts to do so a violation of my personal integrity. I consider ad blocking to be justified self-defense. I will literally do everything in my power to avoid looking at ads. reply seabass-labrax 2 hours agorootparentMost online advertisements are as intrusive from a mental attention perspective as a door-to-door salesman is intrusive from a personal space perspective. Yet, the former is somehow considered acceptable even in societies where the latter is completely taboo.I always try to make sure my online contributions are worthy of the valuable attention of their readers they take up. reply dcow 5 hours agorootparentprevSo, I think there’s a massive difference between ads in de-facto public spaces where consent is impossible, and ads in an environment where there’s full affirmative consent.Billboards on a highway: mind rape. reply civilitty 5 hours agorootparentprev> Is hearing or seeing any idea that you have not previously consented to likewise mind rape?I&#x27;ll bite: yes. If you show me images of goatse or mutilated bodies in a war zone without my consent that’s mind rape. Same with bring politics forcibly into the workplace, showing Fox News (or MSNBC or whatever) at the bbq joint while I’m trying to eat or at the gym while I’m trying to exercise, or screaming at me in protest while I’m trying to access family planning services.Just like women have the right to walk down the street in whatever clothing they want without getting raped, I have the right to experience the world without constantly being bombarded by commercial and political mind rape.> If not, where do you personally draw the line?Consent is implicit via set and setting. If you want to challenge peoples viewpoints go to college or start a poker night with a bunch of philosophically diverse neighbors who like to argue politics. If you want to shove ads down everyone&#x27;s throat, go join an influencer support group.Everyone else deserves to live free from constant mental assault.> And, just as importantly, who do you feel should get to decide in the general case?Judges, the people who interpret laws. reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparent> I have the right to experience the world without constantly being bombarded by commercial and political mind rape.Exactly. Our minds are sacred. reply superdug 4 hours agorootparentprevTherein lies the rub (or more precisely the problem) advertising at its core does _NOT_ have to be evil. Taking into account that the onus of every advertisement is to entice you to do something that you may have otherwise not considered we still do not negate the need for an advertisement to be evil. Now, you may very well be enticed to do something that is not in absolutely everyone’s best interests in mind, which does indeed qualify as evil. And I believe we agree that there are far too many advertisements prevalent that are indeed evil when referring specifically towards advertisements on a digital medium. So I think that the argument is valid that ending all advertising would ultimately prevent all evil advertising it would also prevent any not evil advertising from ever happening as well. Now again, that may be perfectly acceptable to you, your argument that advertising should not happen at all isn’t really practical for absolutely everyone who does or doesn’t support your absolute opinion on advertisements, as contrary to you, but they want you to simply affirm that their opinion is not absolutely based on them supporting the evil ads that you both abhor. reply yjftsjthsd-h 4 hours agorootparent> Therein lies the rub (or more precisely the problem) advertising at its core does _NOT_ have to be evil.Interestingly, I agree that it doesn&#x27;t have to be evil, but in practice it is, so close to 100% of the time that the exceptions are actually not worth discussing. reply superdug 3 hours agorootparentThat’s not an invalid personal opinion but does not make it true for absolutely everyone else at the same time. reply matheusmoreira 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure what your point is but I&#x27;ll respond to this:> advertising at its core does _NOT_ have to be evilAdvertising has inherent and irreconciliable conflicts of interest that make it worthless to any rational person. They&#x27;re trying to sell you stuff, it&#x27;s literally guaranteed that they will be overstating the pros and downplaying the cons. When you want to make an informed decision, the last person you want to listen to is the advertiser. You want to listen to people you personally trust or independent third parties, not the seller who has every incentive in the world to lie to you.Therefore the existence of advertising is incompatible with a rational society. There is no such thing as \"non-evil\" advertising. It doesn&#x27;t inform anyone. On the contrary: it is disinformation, inherently untrustworthy. reply superdug 3 hours agorootparentBut again, why is selling stuff abhorred by you as an absolute. A transaction which is facilitated by money is the key component to guaranteed assertion that a single valued skill can be exercised for any good or service at any time so long as everyone agrees that the compensation is fair and reasonable by all concerned parties. It’s one of fundamental components of an interdependent system that furthers the entire race at the same time and regulates itself to follow the current definition of justice needed to ensure continued success of all parties involved. As progress moves forward so then does the equality shared benefit of a longer and more fulfilling existence than would have otherwise been impossible. reply matheusmoreira 3 hours agorootparentI have no problem with buying and selling stuff or with transacting in general. I have a problem trusting sellers. I refuse to take them at their word. I do not want to hear what they have to say at all.

If you consider your browser client code as your \"source code\" and the browser as a \"dynamically linked library\", then there are substantial pros and cons.Your proposal, while feasible, turns this into a static linking affair. This comes with many risks, like becoming complacent and not updating the \"inner browser\" due to browser incompatibilities and bugs. It creates a giant mess of dependency update hell if you aren&#x27;t regularly updating the webview.At that point, you might as well ship a desktop app that does something similar and proxies ads through the first party server since it&#x27;s probably less work.You are right that it would work. I just don&#x27;t know if going to such lengths is required to achieve the same thing.A good counter is that a desktop app could be exploited to alter the behavior via reverse engineering. But a browser would show you the WASM as well, so I&#x27;m sure you could reverse engineer it and alter it with an extension like a traditional binary.Maybe I&#x27;m missing something though - I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m an advocate of WASM but don&#x27;t keep super up to date on all advancements. reply chii 8 hours agorootparent> ship a desktop appuser doesn&#x27;t want to download an app, since that has a lot of friction. Going to a url and waiting (even if the download time is the same) feels like there&#x27;s less friction, and so this idea of shipping a blackbox is more desirable.The only problem really is the jankiness of any non-browser controls. The user expects a good right-click context menu, keyboard navigation, scrolling, etc, which all would have to be implemented if you&#x27;re compiling a native app into WASM. But if the app itself is just HTML+javascript, then shipping a WASM browser, then using that browser as the app layer solves all of those UX jankiness (since the user should not really be able to tell it&#x27;s a WASM browser).The idea is insidiouly bad for user freedom, but great for businesses like google (who wants to control the user space completely). reply wodenokoto 3 hours agoparentprevI don’t understand why ads aren’t just served from same origin as the rest of the content.

Chrome is the new i.e. as i.e. was in 2002, namely, most people regarded it as “the only browser any normal person would ever use.”Safari is the new i.e. in the sense that i.e. was in the late 2000s&#x2F;early 2010s, meaning it’s the browser that we would like to ignore due to how weird it is compared to the browser we normally target. And how stubborn the vendor is in neither acting like the majority browser, nor giving up and adopting a different engine (or in the case of iOS, even allowing a different engine to run). reply dirtyhippiefree 12 hours agorootparentI see: in the case of iOS, even allowing a different engine to runI’m hearing: iOS is •considerably more secure• like Blackberry was. reply leblancfg 13 hours agorootparentprevI think GP meant \"the minority browser we bend our logic for, in order to accommodate\" reply simondotau 11 hours agorootparent> \"the minority browser we bend our logic for, in order to accommodate\"The web is dead.

Interoperability and platform agnosticism is for losers. reply simondotau 9 hours agorootparentOh and before anyone says anything, I&#x27;m a staunch Firefox user and have been continuously since its first release. And in the last few years I&#x27;m starting to see a marked growth in sites which don&#x27;t work in Firefox, usually because of something like a bug in their Content Security Policy which Firefox correctly rejects and Chrome doesn&#x27;t.It&#x27;s becoming increasingly clear that the vast majority of web developers are now exclusively using Chrome and resent the idea of testing elsewhere. reply jameslk 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, that is what I meant. I have to work on a lot of e-commerce websites and the WebKit browser engine is the one that seems to always be late to the party or outright won’t support new features. But of course most shoppers on a website are on mobile Safari, especially the ones making purchases. And there’s nothing anyone can do about it because Apple won’t allow other types of browser engines on iOS. reply simondotau 11 hours agorootparentIf you need “new features” not available in Safari in order to run an ecommerce website, I’m fairly confident that you’re doing it wrong.(Of course usually when one delves into exactly what features Safari is missing, specifically the ones which piss off web developers, it’s push notifications. And to that I salute Apple for bravely holding the line against that nonsense.) reply jameslk 11 hours agorootparentNo, for me they have more to do with web performance. Look up how to track Largest Contentful Paint in Safari, for example.

WebKit somehow had to fit the iPad 2 and still be quite fast, so Uzbl, which is very bare-bones, felt very fast indeed on a decent computer.I was looking at similar browsers, apparently epiphany (Gnome Web) is the only remaining open source browser based on WebkitGTK+ that&#x27;s still maintained.

I rarely use FF (opting for LibreWolf).On Brave (no extensions at all, except built in protections), the site runs at ~121FPS and the fonts look normal enough (no zoom, page at 100%).

I discovered that VOIP phone numbers on a resume is extremely highly correlated with the applicant lying about where they live.If it weren’t for this screening step, I literally wouldn’t be able to hire anyone because the volume of fraud is so incredibly high that it drowns out legitimate candidates.I wish there were a way to detect fraud while never having a false positive.But the reality is that a lot of the heuristics you listed are indeed strongly correlated with fraud.

They slow down the attacker. In fact, hackers are employing account lockouts to lock security teams and management out of their own accounts when they launch an attack.I&#x27;m with OP on this one.

The parent didn&#x27;t set it up as a means to filter. In your situation you have a list of applicants that you are filtering. In the parent&#x27;s scenario they do not yet have applicants, they simply ask their network if there&#x27;s any suggested candidates which then forms the list that they will filter from.It&#x27;s as discriminatory as posting on Linkedin but not on Indeed. The discrimination would come from the counterfactual question of: supposing they posted the job listing to a larger network _and_ supposing a clearly more qualified applicant applied, would that better applicant be turned down due to nepotism. That&#x27;s the difference. No one is getting upset at family businesses despite almost certainly failing the counterfactual. reply 15457345234 1 hour agorootparentprevAny thread about online scamming will include comments from a bunch of online scammers telling you that the things you can do to make their life harder are unethical. reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentprevIn the first case, you&#x27;re not rejecting candidates at all.

If potential applicants aren&#x27;t given consideration because they&#x27;re not in the network, it doesn&#x27;t matter that the hiring committee thinks they&#x27;re innocent, or isn&#x27;t technically rejecting them.It&#x27;s a bad heuristic. reply godelski 6 hours agorootparentBe careful with your logic and framing. I explained why it was poor framing above. But the way you&#x27;ve (and the gp) framed it is dangerous. Swap \"voip numbers\" for \"x skin color\" and you&#x27;re in clear unethical and illegal territory. But swap the attributes of the parent and you don&#x27;t get this issue. If parent is x race and all their friends are also x race you&#x27;re not discriminating against y race through their means because they aren&#x27;t turning down based on race, it is just closer to changing the odds. The problem isn&#x27;t when you change the odds (unless there&#x27;s an extreme manipulation) but rather how you respond to samples from the distribution. reply SantalBlush 4 hours agorootparentThis is wrong. You are expected to discriminate against samples from the distribution in a variety of ways, like the formatting of their resume and their work history; it only becomes unethical when you discriminate based on race, gender, etc. If you replace \"voip numbers\" with \"x skin color\", of course that would be unethical, but being able to switch phrases to make them unethical is irrelevant, because we&#x27;re not discussing the unethical case.The example of networking you give has even more potential for unethical behavior than filtering voip numbers. replyjerome-jh 22 minutes agorootparentprevAt some point every serious fraudster circumvents the protection and you are only blocking legitimate people.OK this is probably an overstatement, but the 99% to 1% ratio must to be questioned though. reply creer 5 hours agorootparentprevSeems to me you are filtering against agile, tech-aware candidates - prefering less agile, less tech-aware candidates.

What&#x27;s their business model? They&#x27;re going to have to give you a SS# or EIN (if they&#x27;re a self-employed consultant) before you can send them a paycheck, right? And the Social Security Administration has a website where you can verify SS numbers. So what&#x27;s the play here? reply TeMPOraL 6 hours agorootparentThe applicant is actually three people involved in a scam. One is an US person that can provide valid US SSN or other magic numbers, but otherwise doesn&#x27;t know first thing about anything. Second is the person running the scam, located anywhere. Third is a person from low-cost country that&#x27;s skilled enough to pass the interview pretending to be the first person, who might also be responsible for doing the actual job such the interviews succeed. The fat US salary is split between the three parties.This is actually the case of a thing you mentioned, just sadly in reverse. A phone number may indeed not identify a single person. It may represent three unrelated individuals at the same time.FWIW, I&#x27;m 100% with you on your list. Even if it&#x27;s only 1% of false positives, it&#x27;s a massive number of people at global scale, and frankly also a big percentage.

I&#x27;d guess most of these services are usinf BSSID (more or less mac address of the access point) instead of SSID and not using channel number or signal strength.If you report GPS position and BSSIDs anytime you see them, you can probably approximate a location when you only have a BSSID.

Working in a space with some fraud though I can tell you the majority of users verify fine and there ate only the few percentage that don’t for any number of reasons some what you have given above. For smaller vendors though things to consider are- a charge back can come up to 6 months later. A loss of that is not only a loss of funds but a charge back fee- too many charge backs could affect the merchant account with the potential of a loss of being able to run your business and this can extend to PayPal or anything merchants run charges through.- Fees may go up like interchange fees on running credit cards if an account is deemed higher risk.- blacklisting from visa or Mastercard or merchant accounts in general is not unheard of. Loosing access to running credit cards would be the end of many businesses.So mom and pop shops need to be aware of fraud and ensure it is low or taken care of. You can’t just accept every order and hope for the best. Fraud does exists and when only a few percentage of users meet your list of incorrect fraud assumptions it’s easy to see why they are used at least for extra verification.One good thing for merchants for those who accept crypto like Bitcoin is all the risk moves to the sender not the merchant. There are no charge backs - so merchants who take crypto should be able to be a bit more lenient on payments and verification. reply ajb 10 hours agorootparentThe problem is that it&#x27;s not acceptable for online providers to converge on making life miserable for \"a few percent\" of people.This is a market failure: to save the cost of a few bucks, huge costs are imposed on these individuals.

Look for banks that issue virtual cards that can be used with Apple Pay &#x2F; Google Pay. But you also need ideally two physical cards, since one bank may block your physical card for \"fraud\" while traveling, and now you&#x27;re stuck and unable to buy a train ticket.Credit cards are only necessary for car rentals, which is a major pain, but sometimes they can just make a reservation charge of 1000 EUR that they later cancel.The benefit of virtual cards is that you usually get a notification (if you have internet) that your card is blocked, and details about the transaction, which makes it easier to unblock, and understand why the transaction&#x2F;card was blocked. reply kalleboo 1 hour agorootparentWith several of my (physical) credit cards, I get an SMS and Email when a charge is blocked, and I can log into my internet banking to assert that the charge was actually me.

I remember when the credit card companies ran commercials about how easy and secure credit cards are, especially compared to checks, but now I feel like a criminal every time I try to use mine.

Someone else gets into the account and requests a transaction to a new address.Also fun story about how your advice doesn&#x27;t always work, I was locked out from my money multiple times on my honeymoon in Greece despite repeated calls to the bank, repeated unlockings of said account, “hi I am actually standing at an ATM in this bank branch, can we track this account lockup in real time?”... I think with all of the time on hold I actually might have spent something like 20+ hours in the trip trying to debug it over the several times it happened.When we finally resolved it, I&#x27;m not 100% sure about the explanation, but it was something like “the person you called a week ago put in country code GE for Georgia rather than GR for Greece, and that is the first place everybody else who has serviced your request has probably looked, but they all probably thought GE was right because you have to memorize that DE is Germany and so people get confused real easily...” reply brianmiddleton 18 hours agorootparentprevThat does help a bit with the banks, but I&#x27;ve not had any luck at all with the stores who cancel my orders after the payment goes through.

However, what irks me is when I&#x27;m bound to use products or services from providers who fail to execute their roles properly despite being compensated for it.A recent incident at my child&#x27;s school serves as a pertinent example. They transitioned from a traditional cash-based food delivery system to a new digital platform. While trying to register on this platform, I was prompted to provide an \"email\". I input my usual email address only to be met with an \"invalid email\" response. After multiple back-and-forths with both the school and the platform&#x27;s support, I discovered that by \"email\", they actually meant a \"Gmail account\".For context, I&#x27;ve been using my own domain for my email, which ends in .international, for over a decade now—longer than my 9-year-old child has been alive. Despite this, they deemed my email domain \"new\". The situation reached a head when the school&#x27;s principal called me, trying to understand the issue. After explaining the situation, he assured me that the problem was on my end, stating that he had consulted with other teachers and they were in agreement that \".international\" wasn&#x27;t a \"real platform\". reply SuperNinKenDo 12 hours agoparentWell in my opinion, this is what it means to support digitisation. It means accepting that these situations will become more and more commonplace. It is simply the price you pay.In your other comment you mention that people handling email should be familiarising themselves properly with RFCs. Yeah. Maybe. Probably actually you&#x27;re right.Putting aside the problem of ehether they actually _have to_ or _will_ for a second. Do you think it&#x27;s reasonable that the people at your child&#x27;s school will? No, of course not. And they&#x27;re the ones who will choose these providers. Not you.To support digitisation is to support the tyranny of technical ignorance in every facet of our lives. reply OkayPhysicist 9 hours agorootparentFrankly, examples like GP&#x27;s are a compelling argument for professional licensure for software developers, because \"only accepting gmail addresses as valid emails\" should be considered professional malpractice. reply arp242 6 hours agorootparentThe effect will be marginal; it will just create a huge administrative bonanza, and the number of times where it will be used (i.e. software devs being \"disbarred\") will be few enough that it won&#x27;t matter much in practice. reply bo1024 11 hours agorootparentprevNo, I think the situation is more nuanced than this. Why do the people at the school have providers who only accept gmail? Because some extremely technical people who understand exactly what they’re doing have led the web further and further into platform lock-in, and others go along with it. reply arp242 6 hours agorootparentprevIn this case it&#x27;s relatively benign; the worst result is that they&#x27;ll have to create a (free) gmail account to forward to their domain. It&#x27;s annoying and stupid, bit in the grand scheme of things, acceptable.But in other cases the results are much more severe.I got vaccinated for Covid. But I couldn&#x27;t get a \"Covid passport\" because I didn&#x27;t have the right government account and couldn&#x27;t get one as I didn&#x27;t have eligible housing. I literally had the \"proof of vaccinations\", but turns out that doesn&#x27;t count as \"proof\". Great. You know what sucks more than a Covid lockdown?

Could you maybe get them actually to try sending you an email to that address and show them that, yes, you do receive the damnned thing? reply Habgdnv 17 hours agorootparentI initially wrote a much longer comment, detailing multiple instances like these from just the past few months. But then I just deleted it because it will be too long. As for them - They will just tell \"huh, he is hacker and can send fake emails from fake non-existing platforms\".It&#x27;s like me attempting to demonstrate my possession of a private key for an SSL certificate to someone who lacks even a basic understanding of what a \"browser\" is, or who has never encountered terms like HTTP or HTTPS.Another thought, more closely aligned with the original poster&#x27;s point: if someone pushes to transition everything to a digital format, he must first understand what that means. For instance, if you&#x27;re looking to gather email addresses, take the time to familiarize yourself with relevant RFCs. Understand that the local part of the email is determined by the user, not you. So, if I decide my email address should be \"john with space here-doe!@#$%^&\"@example.international, and I&#x27;ve set up my server to accept messages directed to this address, and given that IANA recognizes \".international\" as a valid TLD, then it&#x27;s a legitimate email. For clarity&#x27;s sake, my actual email is of the format first.last@example.international, without any \"non-standard\" characters.And as a connection to the OP - they are pushing for debit&#x2F;credit cards society and when they make sure that all your money are with them and you don&#x27;t have a single cent on you - they just cut you because you&#x27;re just 0.001% and an edge case. But that is their point of view. From your point of view its like this: At home if my card stops working i can go to my bank the very next day and get it sorted. I can walk for 15 minutes and be at my mom&#x27;s place where I can eat everything for free. The next day you are in another country where you don&#x27;t know anybody and if your card stops there, they just leave you to the wolves. For them you&#x27;re the edge case - 0.001%.

Even more, if I&#x27;m using a balance paid by gift card, who give Amazon or other services the right to put my account on hold while it still contains my hard earned money[?]There are many payment methods around the world that have different rules, but for Visa, MC, and Amex cards issued by American banks, the merchant, not the card issuer, has the liability to repay fraudulent on-line purchases (so-called \"card not present\" transactions). The merchant is the one accepting the risk, not your bank. So they decide which transactions they will accept liability for and which they will decline and what you need to do to prove that their liability is low.In addition, some second-factor systems (like possibly 3D secure) shift the liability from the merchant to the issuer when passed, but banking rules are arcane, and it is likely that 3D secure only shifts the liability for the one transaction that triggered it, and not any subsequent transactions. reply notatoad 7 hours agoprev>who are you (as a random online service) to assume you can act as my big brother?we&#x27;re the people who suffer the consequences of the fraud. if your card gets used fraudulently, you call your bank and get the transactions cancelled, no big deal.if my website lets a fraudulent transaction through, my processing fees go up. if my website lets more than a couple fraudulent transactions through (or not even necessarily frauddulent, but transactions that the issuing banks classify as high-risk) the credit card companies shut off my ability to process payments and my business shuts down. so yeah, sorry if it inconveniences you, but accepting a payment from some random guy who even slightly matches some fraud characteristics isn&#x27;t worth risking my business over. reply jrockway 4 hours agoparentYup.

I promptly report it, transactions reversed and the bank issued a new card. After this, I was getting fraud alerts and either informative or confirmation SMS when that was triggered in the past. It seemed to follow whenever a transaction passed $100, then $500, then $1000 and a certain frequency or off-hours.It&#x27;s like the risk threshold got a reset with the new issued plastic. Eventually the algorithm was trained I suppose, back it was back to where it was, and stopped getting alerts for anything out of the usual. This resonates with the experience of friends in the same bank, who hardly ever use their credit cards, so whatever they buy gets flagged and someone calls to make sure it&#x27;s them.Old fashioned banks who are behind the times in technology, but keep richer clients, are usually less annoying, both with the fraud algos thing and also the KYC stuff, and sometimes the difference is massive. reply sentientslug 13 hours agorootparentprevGreat idea, spend your money to earn the privilege of spending your money later. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 13 hours agorootparentprevI do the same, and again when I land.

In the end the easiest was to just open a new account with a different email.Somebody mentioned Google services, and that was a big issue as well. I still have bank accounts in my former country of residence, so I need access to apps from that country (the 2fa App that is used there). On the other hand I need to access some apps here (school notifications, banks...) Google obviously knows better than to allow me to get apps from different regions. The solution was again to just create another account. The whole system is really screwed up.

Occasionally you have to call again for a specific high-value ($500+) transaction, but it&#x27;s rarely more than a 5-minute phone call.And then as to buying&#x2F;using gift cards in India, on a non-Indian account, of course that&#x27;s going to raise every suspicion under the sun, given that that&#x27;s a mechanism used by some of the most prevalent scams in the world.So I&#x27;m really confused, because this \"vent\" reads like somebody not going through the basic steps to use credit cards abroad, and then engaging in the biggest red-flag types of transactions.And the fact that they&#x27;re complaining the airport doesn&#x27;t allow them to carry enough cash (isn&#x27;t the limit $10K?) really raises red flags for me.

I tried again and they blocked the card again.So I did an instant transfer to another bank account and used its debit card without a hitch, as usual.Some banks just won’t let you use your money as you please. Your luck is in finding a bank that does. reply phantomathkg 18 hours agoparentprevIf I did not misunderstand what OP was saying, I think he is saying Amazon or other company hold his account but not the card issuing bank itself. reply aiProgMach 18 hours agoparentprev1- The issue is rarely from the debit card it&#x27;s always accepted, most of the times the payment will be cancelled from the service provider side2- It&#x27;s not technically non-Indian account, I&#x27;m opening accounts using valid Indian mobile number (tied to my visa and a real address), I always disclose that I&#x27;m not Indian when needed.3- I was even trying to open Indian bank account to transfer money but no success so far (while possible in theory as I understood).There are legitimate reasons for not wiring money if that was even an option, because you don&#x27;t pay the hospital large amount ahead, and when it&#x27;s time there&#x27;s not enough time to wire the money. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentAh sorry, it was hard to understand what types of transactions you were talking about. Yes, the reality is that when you try to live in a foreign country and do non-touristy \"resident\" things like buy things online or pay bills, but when you don&#x27;t actually have a work visa that allows you to open a local bank account -- the systems aren&#x27;t built for that. And local merchants really do put themselves at the risk of scams -- even with debit cards, transactions can be reversed by banks (stolen debit cards are a thing), and then the merchant is out of merchandise and money. It sucks, and you just wind up having to rely on a friend or family member to do your online purchases. It&#x27;s such a small group of people, that companies don&#x27;t do much to support those edge cases.I still don&#x27;t understand why you couldn&#x27;t wire money though. That&#x27;s what wiring money internationally is for. If timing with the hospital is an issue, you just wire yourself or your family member in advance -- that&#x27;s usually more common than attempting to a the hospital directly. (And even if you do have to wire the hospital directly, you can provide proof of the fact that the wire was initiated from your bank.) The only problem I can think of with wiring money is the fact that the money is illegal or someone is trying to evade taxes or something. If the money is perfectly legal, then what is the problem? reply starttoaster 11 hours agorootparent> because you don&#x27;t pay the hospital large amount ahead, and when it&#x27;s time there&#x27;s not enough time to wire the money.This was their justification against wire transfers. Obviously I don&#x27;t know how the accounts receivable department works in Indian hospitals because I&#x27;ve never been to India let alone a hospital there, but this strikes me as unusual. A couple days delay to pay large sums of money seems more than reasonable. reply withinboredom 9 hours agorootparentwiring money via international accounts is instantaneous, last time I had wired money to me (last week). Or at least within an hour or two. The issue here, probably, is that there is usually a fairly large fee attached to it from the receiving bank. My bank, it&#x27;s 25 bucks, flat rate. Each and every wire, even if it is 5 bucks being wired. reply starttoaster 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll take your word for it, a glance at google told me a wire transfer from a foreign bank will typically take about 2 days to clear, but I&#x27;ve only ever done wire transfers domestically. But yeah, a $25 fee might be the hold up, except if I&#x27;m understanding the OP, the wire transfer would be for costly medical care. Typically if I&#x27;m looking at paying a large bill, the bill blinds me from the pain of being nickel and dimed on fees. So I think we&#x27;re probably not talking about paying $5 at 7-11. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentIt’s India. The land of the thrifty, always looking for a deal (cultural stereotype). It’s the reason so many US companies have a hard time breaking into that market though.My boss and I spent several weeks in India talking to people and learning the cultural basics just to figure out how to price our products. If you want to sell there, you need extremely competitive pricing with discounts, in a very price-sensitive market.

The amount is almost the same for all three. The first payment always goes off without a hitch. But, when I go to pay for the second kid, bam, it locks up the account. Our local branch is utterly clueless. Then we will have to jump through multiple hoops to get the account activated. This whole drama happens like clockwork every three months. It doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s just a school payment, and doesn&#x27;t matter that thousands of parents are making payment around that time.Friends holding accounts in other banks face the same issues. So, it is not isolated to my bank and changing banks will not help.So, now, we&#x27;ve decided to take the one-kid-a-day approach. It&#x27;s a bit more work, &#x27;cause I have to remember to make those payments over three days, but it sure beats the headache of reactivating the account every time. reply csomar 1 hour agoprevI am of the opinion that these restrictions are used (quietly) to preform a kind of capital restrictions while not (officially) having such capital restrictions in place. This happens because governments (or populations?) have accepted that, say, an agriculture bill (or law) can have sections that cover tech. So if you are trying to do something and you don&#x27;t want to say it, you slip it in under \"fraud\" or \"AML\" or something else.Now that everyone (including third-world countries) have figured that out; and legacy companies (big Tech, MasterCard&#x2F;Visa, big banks) know that this makes their customer life hellish however it kills competition: They&#x27;ll bend over backward, forward and multi-laterally to implement anything that any lawmaker asks them for.If you are a very simple simpleton, say a government official with a single income, a regular rental, and regular bills (your groceries and your kids pencils), you&#x27;ll very unlikely face any issue.

From a consumer&#x27;s POV, the system just denies you stuff for no apparent reason.From a bank&#x27;s POV, they&#x27;re losing billions of dollars to card fraud operations, and there are very clever fraudsters who do their best to be indistinguishable from legit users.Legit users in rare situations (such as being cross-border) are often collateral damage. You can only understand what heuristic you&#x27;re triggering by knowing a bit about patterns of fraud, which is an unreasonable demand on innocent consumers. reply gnicholas 9 hours agoprevMy credit card company likes to aggressively flag transactions as fraudulent \"for my protection\" — even though it&#x27;s really for their protection. The upshot is that purchases at my local Apple Store (which is walking distance from where I live) get flagged. I have bought many things from Apple over the years, and buy things there at least a couple times a year. So it&#x27;s pretty silly for these transactions to be flagged.The worst part is that they don&#x27;t pro-actively notify me of the flagging via app notification, email, or phone call. I have to track them down and tell them the transaction was authorized.

And good luck trying to purchase on a telephone, between trying to dial in international number, bad connections, and language issues!FWIW, I had the most success with debit cards.

Also, as credit card fraud is usually the bank&#x27;s responsibility, it makes sense for the leaders of that area to go towards more false positives than false negatives.But it does not need to be that way and the government can and should help.In my country (Brazil) banking is well regulated industry and we also have some good consumer laws. Both those things help a lot to show a clear impact of badly designed anti-fraud system to the banks. For example, the central bank has an online channel, where you can open a complaint, which the bank is obligated to answer&#x2F;solve in 5 days and might get fined millions if they get lots of valid ones.I used to get my card denied very often, with no heads-up or call to confirm.

    "originBody": "Pro Workshops Tips Free Tutorials Articles Log in switch to light mode Why you should probably be using SQLite Kent C. Dodds Time to read ~ 7 minutes Published 25 October, 2023 Where you store your application data has enormous impacts on your entire application. There are implications on the entire stack based on what you decide to use here. There are terrific solutions like MySQL and Postgres that have become the default for many people. These are fine solutions. But for most web app use cases, you could drastically simplify your life by using SQLite. SQLite is a sql-based database with a particularly unique feature: the entire database is in a single file. Largely for this reason, many people have historically seen it as a simple database for simple use cases. However, in recent years SQLite has received a great deal of development and attention making it a simple database for even more advanced use cases. Let’s talk about some of those advancements and why for most of us, SQLite is the best balance of trade-offs. Zero Latency The fact that SQLite is a single file on disk comes with a major benefit of 0 latency which drastically reduces the \"n+1 problem.\" This means that as a developer you don’t have to spend so much time worrying about reducing the number of queries you’re making to the database (which can lead to less efficient queries and certainly less efficient developers). And latency itself is not to be underestimated. If you’re not thoughtful about the distance between your database and your application, you can easily put a baseline on your application’s performance. It’s not uncommon for the app-to-database latency to be measured in the tens of milliseconds (and sometimes even hundreds). This means no matter what you do, your page can’t load with fresh data in less than that amount of time. I know performance isn’t the number 1 priority of all apps, but it’s pretty important for most. I’m pretty sure even though the business executive who paid for your app and doesn’t have alternatives doesn’t like loading spinners flashing in their face for every interaction. 🌀😠 One Less Service One huge benefit to SQLite is the fact that it runs as an embedded part of your application. So that’s one less service to babysit. Honestly, that was my primary motivation when I decided to migrate my own website from Postgres to SQLite. I just stick SQLite in the same volume I’m mounting for other data for my application already and I’m off the races. This saves on complexity as well as cost. And this is multiplied by the number of instances and replication considerations, but we’re getting ahead of ourselves… Let’s get into that… Multi-instance replication As a file on disk, you cannot \"distribute\" SQLite directly. However, this is where there have been advancements in this space. For my own applications that need multiple instances, I use LiteFS: LiteFS is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite databases. You can run your application like it’s running against a local on-disk SQLite database but behind the scenes the database is replicated to all the nodes in your cluster. With LiteFS, you can run your database right next to your application on the edge. You can run LiteFS anywhere! On top of this, LiteFS has built-in support to handle the \"Read Replica Consistency\" challenge. So if you need your app to run in multiple instances, you need to use one of these tools. Another solution here is Turso which uses SQLite under the hood and even has a concept called \"embedded replicas\" for zero latency reads. Very cool! Database size Another issue people sometimes bring up is database size. However, SQLite is capable of handling databases that are an Exabyte in size (that's one million Terabytes, or one billion Gigabytes 🤯). Most of us web developers don’t work with near that amount of data. You’ll have much different problems before database size is one of them with SQLite. Even putting large amounts of data in a SQLite database record is pretty efficient! In fact, in some cases, it can be faster to retrieve data out of a SQLite database than from the file system 😆 SQLite is an incredible feat of engineering! Development and Testing I know some of you reading this right now are perfectly comfortable running docker compose as a regular part of your workflow before you start developing your application. But you have to admit that it’s annoying to run multiple apps at once with conflicting databases and ports. With SQLite, it’s a total non-issue. It’s just a file. So you can run multiple instances of the same app at once with no trouble whatsoever. Also, while starting up a new Postgres database is fairly involved (there are of course tools that make it easier), SQLite has no such issue. Again, it’s just a file. Run your production migrations/seed and you’re good to go. And this ease carries over to the testing side of things as well. When your database setup is complicated, you end up spending time evaluating ways to mock out your database at the ORM level so you can avoid having to run and connect to your database during testing and the isolation issues that can happen as a result of that. Not a problem with SQLite. It’s just a file! Each test can have its own database with barely a thought. Just a little bit of code to create and connect the database and then your tests can run on the full database. You can definitely do this with other databases, but not as easily and efficiently as SQLite. Weaknesses SQLite is not without its shortcomings. And it would be unfair of me to just talk about where SQLite shines without addressing some of those. SQLite does not support subscriptions which can be a limitation on certain real-time use cases. However, there are plenty of reasons to recommend against using database subscriptions for real-time use cases anyway. Scaling real-time use cases is quite challenging, and personally have really enjoyed letting Partykit do that part for me in my apps. SQLite being a file on disk does make connecting from external clients effectively impossible. But with Fly.io at least, it’s easy to run prisma studio on the production server and proxy that for local access. If you need to connect to it from another app, then you’re out of luck and have to set up HTTP endpoints on the host app for any data you need (for now). SQLite does not support plugins like TimescaleDB for Postgres. While time-series data is possible with SQLite, I do not have experience with this use case and can't speak to the challenges there. My intuition says it's not advisable to use SQLite for that use case, but maybe someone else can offer me more insight. SQLite does not support enums which means you're forced to use strings. I have mixed feelings about this, but I mostly don't like enums anyway. The main drawback to this is when it comes to the typings for the client which doesn't allow you to ensure all values of a column are only within a set of specific possible values for the string. However, with Prisma client extensions, handling this kind of enforcement at the client (and typing) level is possible. Conclusion So, can you use SQLite? For the vast majority of you reading this, the answer is “yes.” Should you use SQLite? I’d say that still for the majority of you reading this, the answer is also “yes.” Though it’s complicated. As with everything in technology, there are multiple solutions that will work out. But I think you should give SQLite a serious look due to the performance, simplification, and cost benefits I’ve mentioned. And that’s why I’m using SQLite for my own applications and why I teach you to use SQLite in the EpicWeb.dev series of workshops. – Kent Share this article with your friends share on twitter share on facebook share on linkedin share on reddit copy url to clipboard Written by Kent C.

I don&#x27;t believe in mocking the database, so all our tests and local dev run against a real Postgres instance.The main tricks:- Store the Postgres installation in a known location.- Set the dynamic loader path to the installation lib dir, e.g., LD_PRELOAD.- Don&#x27;t run CI as root (or patch out Postgres&#x27; check for root)- Create and cache the data directory based on the source code migrations.- Use clone file to duplicate the cached data directory to give to individual tests.One thing I&#x27;d like to pursue is to store the Postgres data dir in SQLite [1].

The evolution we went through:1. Each test runs all migrations on a fresh database. Each test spends 2.1 seconds on db setup.2. Each test suite runs all migrations. Each test copies the template database from the test suite. Each suite takes 2.1 seconds to run migrations, but cloning a template database takes 300 ms.3. Bazel caches the data dir and rebuilds it once for all test suites. Reduces the initial test suite setup from 2.1 seconds to 160 ms (to copy the datadir).4. Each test in a suite uses clonefile to copy the datadir. Reduces db setup overhead from 300 ms (to copy a template database) to 80 ms (to clonefile a datadir).Currently, most of our testing overhead is clonefile and cleaning up the datadir. I&#x27;m interested in a single file sqlite FS because I could be clever and use LD_PRELOAD to replace Postgres&#x27;s file system operations with sqlite, avoiding most syscalls altogether. reply thom 1 hour agorootparentNice, any chance you’ll package all this up one day?

It&#x27;s not a clear performance win since tmpfs with Postgres fsync=off is mostly memory-backed storage via the page cache already.Another problem is that parallel tests can exhaust memory.The slowest part of our tests is syscall overhead. A mostly empty Postgres data dir for a medium-sized database with a few hundred tables consists of 3k files. On my M1 macOS, it takes 120 ms to delete the entire data dir.

It’s not exactly one file but it’s hidden in a volume somewhere where you don’t need to go file digging, so for all intents and purposes sure, it’s one file.Most ORMs also will let you swap out your RDBMS so you can run sqlite locally and Postgres in prod via the same code. I think this is a bit of an anti pattern though. While the two are similar in most standard use cases, it’s not always apparent when you veer off that standard use case and into something that’s not supported by sqlite. And then all of the sudden you either have a divergence between what works locally vs in production or you start to intentionally limit your app’s capability to only what works with sqlite because you can’t locally validate it. reply captn3m0 18 hours agorootparentManaging Postgres, even via containers is not so simple.

And while I do not endorse his suggestion of using SQLite in a multi node setup, I can tell you from personal experience that running a multi-node RDMS is hard as hell.In $oldjob I designed and managed a system that was eventually running many hundreds of MySQL 3-node groups. MySQL in particular has a lot of nobs that you need to understand to set up a cluster that doesn&#x27;t lose data during a fail over (semi sync, sync bin log, trx commit flush, ....). And then of course: neither MySQL nor PostgreSQL have a built-in mechanism to handle fail overs at all. It&#x27;s another software stack around that, or even something custom built.Again, not saying I agree with the author. I&#x27;m just saying you&#x27;re portraying it easier than it actually is. reply Aurornis 20 hours agorootparent> Your comment implies that running a database cluster is easyYou obviously don’t need a cluster if you’re considering SQLite as an alternative.Comparing a full database cluster to SQLite doesn’t make sense. reply binwiederhier 20 hours agorootparentTangentially related: my personal open source project (ntfy.sh) is starting to outgrow a one node SQLite-backed setup, and I am now faced with the decision we are talking about here (something I would not have imagined, I might add): do I use some SQLite-replication thing, or do I rewrite it all to work with a RDMS and deal with managing that? It&#x27;s quite the annoying choice, so I really wish there was a great SQLite backed solution, hehe. reply aseipp 17 hours agorootparentIf by \"outgrow\" you mean you want to improve concurrent read&#x2F;write performance, availability, and throughput via replication, then I would -- personally, for peace of mind and ease -- look at just buying a managed RDBMS from someone with predictable pricing and using that. Buy PlanetScale, Aurora, Neon, CockroachDB Cloud, etc and let them handle it. PlanetScale and Aurora in particular have plans that let you fix the I&#x2F;O costs and only pay for compute and storage, which is pretty attractive. They also use standard MySQL&#x2F;Postgres, so you can migrate in&#x2F;out to other providers later. It does mean you must spend time on the migration though, and spend time understanding the implications of your new storage choice (latency, failure modes, etc.)If you just want peace of mind and better disaster handling, and your current uptime, concurrent workload split, and performance is fine -- maybe your hosting provider eats it for an hour or two and you don&#x27;t want to be hamstrung -- I would suggest just using a tool like Litestream, replicating the DB to S3, and setting up a hot standby server in some alternative region that you can fail over to and that actively synchronizes the working set. Always keep them up to date with deployment automation. Set up some alerting, and if a failure happens, terminate the main instance with prejudice, let the replica catch up by replaying any latest changes, and reorient your load balancer to point to it (Cloudflare tunnels are a good low-tech solution you could use to do that.) This might imply a small downtime window for the hot failover. For bonus points, you can automate this whole task, and actively perform it regularly, swapping between servers on regular cadence -- thus turning the design from having a primary&#x2F;standby to simply having two interchangeable systems that swap roles. And then you have good confidence in hot-failover disaster recovery. e.g. just do this whole dance every week on Monday at 1am UTC, and you can have confidence it works and will stay working.I do not know what other architectural constraints you might have. These are just suggestions. Good luck! reply robertlagrant 19 hours agorootparentprevI know it&#x27;s heresy, but could you defer the decision by sharding?

SQL Server and Postgres MONEY type will additionally format values with a currency symbol, when converted to a character string.In SQLite you&#x27;re out of luck - if you want accounting values you&#x27;ll have to store them as integers and scale the values yourself.Source: I work on a mobile app with offline storage of pricing and weighed quantities, using SQLite in the app, and SQL Server on the back end. reply mercxry 42 minutes agorootparentYou should still not use MONEY in Postgres, even their own website says so [1].I still wouldn&#x27;t use floats&#x2F;numerics&#x2F;decimals to store currency either in any db generally, as said by others you&#x27;re going to end up with inaccurate numbers [2].Therefore using integers is in fact very good for this use-case, especially if you are in accounting or book-keeping!Source: I work for a Fintech company that processes millions of payments.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use...

You often need velocity more than clean code, because you are not sure if the idea will get traction at all. In that case, from a business perspective, to be able to experiment you need velocity more than a good data model.I did this kind of exploratory development both with SQLite and Postgres, both had different strengths and weaknesses. Had the purist clean data model with Postgres cost more than it should have when the product had to pivot the product. Also have seen the scalability limits of SQLite. Just shutting down a POC project backed by SQLite, which failed to get traction mostly because of business execution problems, and SQLite saved a lot of effort for the implementation, and using a \"cleaner\" and \"more scalable\" solution would have only reduced velocity, but would not have got us more users, the system worked fine this way (even has N+1 queries in some places). Should we got to the point that SQLite starts to become a bottleneck we could have afforded to clean the data layer (we had to rework countless times already as requirements were in a flux) up a bit and move to more scalable solution. Others might stick Firebase or MongoDB there, and it also does work for a while, and that is also a valid decision IMHO from a business perspective.I think this is a kind of topic where the premature optimization is the root of all evil meme can apply, depending on the product you are making and the available resource pool. Not for the hello world examples of course, and not for the well defined well funded project, but there are lot of exploratory attempts out of the bigco&#x2F;vc funded unicorn world. reply yawaramin 19 hours agorootparentprevBut the thing is that in SQLite you effectively don&#x27;t have N+1 issues. replyJohnBooty 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s frustratingly close to correct.

SQLite is a simple method to getting something together, before building a proper MySQL&#x2F;SQLServer&#x2F;Postgres one.2) Client software. Some client software needs a temporary data store and find SQLite great for this. These are not complicated databases. They barely have about 5 tables. Nothing more than a Queue system than anything, which goes over the wire via Rest API to a Messsaging Queue. Once sent over with a reply of \"success\" - it is removed from SQLite. It is a nice, simple system.There can be a few other reasons.Other than the above, I don&#x27;t think I would be confident of SQLite file for a moderately sized database, likely to be used for some web portal or CMS system we created where more than one request could be talking to the database at the same time. This is why you should stick to those central, relational databases.MySQL and Postgres, especially, are not that difficult to install, whether on the same system or its own dedicated server.I hope my comment is not seen as a negative for SQLite. If anything, my attitude is the opposite. I really like the work and effort that has gone into SQLite. A virtual pat-on-the-back by those involved! It is a great approach to having data in 1 file, rather than writing your own.. or having lots of \"records\" in their own files (in a directory) which I have done. reply rmbyrro 19 hours agoparentI think it can be used for most things that have a low concurrency level and don&#x27;t need real-time replication.There are replication \"solutions\" for SQLite, but then it stops being simple and you&#x27;re better off using Postgres. reply beoberha 20 hours agoprevSQLite is an awesome tool, but I wish we’d stop trying to force it into situations it wasn’t made for. It doesn’t belong anywhere near a web app deployment that currently or will span two or more machines.

The primary node is the only one that can write data to the database. The other nodes are called replicas and they provide a read-only copy.Might as well have just set up a separate DB server, less faff. At the point where you need to scale MySQL&#x2F;postgres beyond vertical scaling you can probably afford to pay someone to do it for you reply pookha 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve seen people use a few hundred lines of javascript to create full blown distributed systems that are offline and end to end encrypted and backed by sqlite. They only use the server as a glorified caching system to sync to\\from. It&#x27;s esoteric (logical clocks, conflict free replicated data types), but that&#x27;s a hell of a lot more distributed than a client-server architecture and it&#x27;s backed entirely with sqlite. reply beoberha 18 hours agorootparentI mean this is kinda what I’m trying to get at. You need to build all this bespoke infra in order to fit SQLite into the round role where a database with native replication is a far more proven and battle tested solution. reply pookha 16 hours agorootparentWhen I say a few hundred lines of javascript (and I&#x27;m no fan of javascript) I literally mean a few hundred lines of javascript. No frameworks. No complicated server logic. Just CRDTs and a hybrid logical clock (written in fifty or so lines of JS) and a server running a little message bus...I once heard JLong talk about this and demo&#x27;d the capability to a military contractor in an office in old town alexandria and they thought it was hilarious. In just a couple crappy javascript files I was syncing data offline between twenty five different clients regardless of internal system clock speeds (I used a laptop that was running hot and had a fast system clock) or other bullshit. It was magical. And all of that was ran through SQLite. I even used some SQlite PostGIS-like extension during the demo. So yes, sqlite can be distributed in the purest sense of the word. reply chasil 14 hours agoparentprevYou can certainly span two or more machines with provisos that you must not enable WAL mode and there can be only one writer.I have never really examined how this performs, and it would be best if all access was explicitly via SQLITE3_OPEN_READONLY. reply jampekka 20 hours agoparentprevWhat share of web apps actually need to span two or more machines? Something like 0.1%? reply 0xbadcafebee 18 hours agorootparentRunning instances, not machines. There&#x27;s like 15 years of architectural advancement in running web apps that says that more than one copy of stateless software is the best practice. SQLite was not designed to be used for web apps.HN&#x27;s bizarre groupthink occasionally decides to subvert architectural norms for fun, and any blog post that&#x27;s trending on the front page suddenly counts as \"good advice\". Even if it&#x27;s literally insane, if it&#x27;s on the front page it&#x27;s considered sage wisdom, and naysayers are downvoted for being negative about the insanity. reply simonw 16 hours agorootparentSometimes it&#x27;s OK to reconsider.Those 15 years of architectural norms started at a time where a multi-core 2GB server was an expensive luxury!We know a LOT more today about building web applications than we did 15 years ago. That&#x27;s why some of us are ready to say that for a lot of applications, a single server running SQLite (with streaming backups to S3 via Litestream) is actually a pretty great option. reply 0xbadcafebee 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t mean use 15-year old patterns, I mean we&#x27;ve learned over 15 years what&#x27;s good practice and what isn&#x27;t.We used to use .csv and .ini files that way. After that we used BerkeleyDB, since it was built into so many tools. Or serialized objects. If you got fancy you&#x27;d read&#x2F;write them to a temporary filesystem, and occasionally sync the files to NFS; if the app restarts, sync the files from NFS back to temporary storage, or if the temporary file isn&#x27;t there, read it from NFS and write it to temporary storage.Today, if you have to write a web app that has dynamic content and writes and reads user data, you can do it a bunch of ways:- \"Mostly-JS\": Write your app in JavaScript. Some hosted provider out there allows you to submit data to some backend app, and read it from the backend app. (This, by the way, is how CGI-BIN web apps worked 20 years ago)- \"Mostly-CGI\": Use some managed hosting provider to host a web app with some framework they support, like Wordpress, or Django, or something else. Typically they bundle a networked relational database with it, but I suppose you could trade that out for an sqlite file. Probably wouldn&#x27;t support Litestream but you could probably have a cron job copy the file to s3.- \"Mostly-standalone\": Buy some virtual machine or physical server, set it up, maintain it, write your web app, run a web server that runs your web app, write the file to local disk, set up Litestream. Never touch it, patch it, upgrade it, etc, so it always has security vulns, but it will just keep running, so it will be much easier to get going.- \"Mostly-managed\": Pay for some hosted provider to give you the ability to run your app in containers. You build it, you push it, and then set up the thing to run it. Like the previous option, you can opt to never patch or upgrade anything so there&#x27;s nothing to maintain. But since you can use a bunch of SaaS providers to build, test, and deploy automatically, it&#x27;s way less to maintain and much more automated. Again, typically you&#x27;d use a networked relational database, since they&#x27;re largely designed to run one app at a time, but you can customize them to have some background task try to upload your sqlite file out of the container or a sidecar.- \"Completely managed\": You upload your code. They completely manage the versions of your app platform, doing patches, upgrades, running different instances of your app, databases, web servers, whatever you need. You basically don&#x27;t have to think about anything but code. You could use sqlite but there&#x27;s probably no way to back it up.If you don&#x27;t need to read and write user data, you don&#x27;t need a web app at all. A static site works just fine. Hell, you don&#x27;t even need a static site generator anymore, just link to the right css or js files in your html to DRY up your static content. reply jampekka 13 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t \"best practice\" quite literally groupthink?Vast vast majority of web apps run fine on a relatively modest VPS.

Keeping all the customer databases in a single directory&#x2F;disk and then constantly \"lite streaming\" to S3.Because each user is isolated, they&#x27;ll be writing to their own database.

The idea seemed great, at least in theory. Mainly to get away from mysqld, which actually crashed on me and corrupted some data once or twice in a timespan of 15 years.. think it was due to package updates every time.Anyway, query and app logic modifications aside, I quickly ran into two unsolvable issues for me.1. The lack of a robust web based admin tool comparable to phpmyadmin (no, phpliteadmin doesn&#x27;t even come close) 2. No alter table.

Instead of forcing them to make API calls to retrieve all of the data and all the network overhead and latency that entails, periodically write Sqlite DBs to S3 and post an event that the database is available. Can create one database per customer, or whatever your natural partition key is. Then it&#x27;s just pull the database to local disk, pull all the data you need with SQL queries, and delete from the bucket when every client has had a chance to process it.I believe it offers much better throughput than going through an API. reply AYBABTME 17 hours agoprevSQLite is cute and very appropriate in certain cases: - Local storage for a mobile&#x2F;desktop app, instead of a DIY file type. - Local cache storage for a distributed system, instead of a DIY file type.While you can use it as a general backend, and some people work hard to make it usable in distributed systems, it continues to be a fancy elaborate project to turn SQLite into something it isn&#x27;t.

I could instead have gone to work for one of those who are working on SQLite, but I just don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re real products for real web workloads.

We used to be all-in on SQLite but we have discovered some nuance as we grow. We do B2B SaaS&#x2F;PaaS for banking sector.If we have a customer that is OK with RPO measured in minutes-to-hours and they have fewer than 5k active users, we are perfectly happy running with SQLite on a customer-managed VM and instructing them to use snapshots for backup & restore. Everything on one simple cheap VM in Azure&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;on-prem. One storage volume to snapshot. No weird tricks.If the customer demands stronger consistency between their underlying record system and our system (specifically at time of catastrophe) and&#x2F;or has more than 5k active users, then we are starting to push towards a separate cloud-native stack. Azure SQL Server Hyperscale with geographic replication to another region within ~100ms of the primary region. I looked long & hard at some of the SQLite replication options, but there is no way in hell I could get them to pass due diligence with the kinds of CTOs I have to argue with regularly.SQLite is incredible for keeping it light & simple, and we still advocate for this where it fits the overall technical strategy. In terms of performance, before you reach a certain breakpoint, it is very hard to beat SQLite.

The negativity is academic; the productivity is industrial.Here&#x27;s my counter-hype take: SQLite actually kind of sucks. It has a place, but that place isn&#x27;t significantly different from where it was five years ago despite all the \"serverless read replicated VC funded hacker news hype startups\" work that&#x27;s happened since then.If you&#x27;re in crazy-enterprise hell-engineering; no one is going to reach for SQLite when more robust alternatives like Postgres exist.If you&#x27;re trying to get something out the door fast, you&#x27;ve got Postgres on Supabase, you&#x27;ve got MySQL on Planetscale, you&#x27;ve got Firebase, fifteen years of database-platform development, all of these aren&#x27;t just cheap, they&#x27;re free, and zero maintenance, you&#x27;re not going to pay more money to do more work for a worse product by setting up SQLite on your single DigitalOcean VPS. You probably won&#x27;t even reach for something like Cloudflare D1; sure, its interesting, but why? Its just Planetscale, but not better in any way and worse in plenty (its not even really much cheaper).SQLite doesn&#x27;t support alter table. It doesn&#x27;t have a date-time type. It doesn&#x27;t enforce columnar types outside of strict mode, which isn&#x27;t enabled on e.g. Cloudflare D1. Someone stop me. Everyone says \"KISS, you can get so much performance out of one application server with SQLite running locally\" but you can get the same f^cking performance out of one application server, and a DBaaS, like Planetscale, and its easier, and its cheaper, and you get backups, and you get full MySQL, and you get a paved-road to actually paying them $30&#x2F;mo if you need to instead of hitting a bottleneck and suddenly having to wonder how the hell you&#x27;re going to scale SQLite beyond this one instance (\"we need VC funding for more engineers\", you&#x27;ll think in that moment)Kent&#x27;s statement \"However, SQLite is capable of handling databases that are an Exabyte in size\" actually makes me mad.

It&#x27;s also common for data to be distributed. Static type system can handle either of these things.If your database can&#x27;t go down for the duration of a migration (which will need more time now, to type-check all the data), and you don&#x27;t have a way to ensure all clients are updated at the same time also, then you can&#x27;t use static type checking like programming languages have. reply mattrighetti 19 hours agoparentprevI’ve used sqlx and SQLite for a lot of projects and sqlx’s macros have prevented me from inserting the wrong types in columns, but I agree that it’s not a viabile long term solution, especially if you don’t use sqlx macros in the first place which is not something you can always do.On the contrary, I think that everything should be fine with Diesel since that leverages the rust ecosystem to manage types and migrations of the sqlite database. reply simonw 18 hours agoparentprevSQLite with strict mode turned on. reply josegonzalez 18 hours agoprevWho wrote this, an SQLite vendor?On a serious note, there is definitely a time and a place for SQLite - it&#x27;s a great technology - but the engineering being done to make it scalable across multiple servers etc. seems ill-placed.

Photo Illustration: Chris Griggs/Consumer Reports, Getty Images October 25, 2023 By Kevin Loria Data Visualizations by Andy Bergmann 331 shares of the article shares of the article With the holiday season approaching, many of us will be indulging in a favorite treat: chocolate. Yet despite dark chocolate’s reputation as a healthier sweet, it can also be contaminated with lead and cadmium, two heavy metals linked to serious health problems, as many people learned from Consumer Reports’ testing last year. Now CR has the results of our new tests on heavy metal levels in other kinds of chocolates and foods made with it. Hershey: Get the Lead Out of Chocolate Our tests found several Hershey’s products have concerning levels of lead. Tell the company to commit to reducing heavy metals in its products! Read the full petition. Sign The Petition By submitting this form, I agree to the terms of Consumer Reports' Privacy Policy and User Agreement. In chocolate products, the lead and cadmium are concentrated in the cocoa (or cacao), the ingredient that gives chocolate its distinctive flavor. Dark chocolate tends to have higher levels of cacao. But other chocolate products contain cacao, too, in varying quantities—from cocoa powder, which is essentially pure cocoa, to milk chocolate, which can have very little. CR’s experts wanted to see whether other cacao-containing foods posed a risk, so we tested 48 different products in seven categories—cocoa powder, chocolate chips, milk chocolate bars, and mixes for brownies, chocolate cake, and hot chocolate. We also added a few more dark chocolate bars to our test. Products came from big name brands such as Hershey’s, Ghirardelli, and Nestlé; national retailers like Costco, Target, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, and Whole Foods; and specialty makers such as Droste and Navitas. As expected, dark chocolates tended to have higher levels of heavy metals and milk chocolate lower. “But every product we tested had detectable amounts of lead and cadmium,” says James E. Rogers, PhD, director and acting head of product safety testing at CR. “Sixteen of the 48 products had amounts above CR’s levels of concern for at least one of the heavy metals—in some cases more than twice our limit—but we did find safer options in each category of chocolate products.” In This Article Dark Chocolate • Milk Chocolate • Chocolate Chips • Cocoa Powder • Hot Chocolate Mixes • Brownie and Cake Mixes Heavy Metals in Chocolate Heavy metals can be found in many foods—such as arsenic in rice, mercury in some types of fish, cadmium in spinach, and lead in carrots and sweet potatoes. And you can also be exposed through drinking water or your environment (such as lead paint in your house). All these sources can add up, so it is important to be aware of different pathways that contribute to your overall heavy metal intake. Chocolate may just be one of a number of contributing factors to overall heavy metal levels, but it’s a popular treat eaten by children and adults and not an essential part of a someone’s diet. So it makes sense to try to limit the amount of heavy metals people get from chocolate. Exposure to heavy metals is of greatest concern in children and during pregnancy, because they can damage the brain and nervous system, causing developmental delays, learning and behavior problems, and more. But adults can also experience negative effects. For example, frequent lead exposure has been linked to immune system suppression, reproductive issues, kidney damage, and hypertension. Lead and cadmium are the two heavy metals that CR’s tests have found to be the most problematic in chocolate. Research indicates that lead and cadmium get into cocoa in different ways. For cadmium, it appears that the cocoa plant takes it up from the soil. Lead, however, can be deposited on the cocoa beans after harvest, potentially from dust and soil as beans dry outdoors. These metals are both found in the cocoa solids—which, along with cocoa butter, make up cacao. That’s why products rich in cocoa solids, such as dark chocolate and cocoa powder, tend to be higher in heavy metals. How CR Tested Chocolate Products We measured the amount of lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic in three samples of each food and averaged the results. None of the products posed a risk of arsenic or mercury exposure. To assess the risk from lead and cadmium, we looked at whether a serving of each product would expose someone to California’s standard maximum allowable dose levels (MADL) for lead (0.5 micrograms per day) and cadmium (4.1 mcg per day) in food. Note that as part of a settlement to a lawsuit currently in place brought by As You Sow, an organization that pushes for corporate accountability, the vast majority of chocolate products sold in the state are subject to less stringent standards, while companies work to reduce the levels of metals in their chocolate products. CR’s scientists measured heavy metal content against California’s standard levels because there are no federal limits for the amount of lead and cadmium most foods can contain, and they believe that California’s standard levels are the most protective available. However, our tests are not assessments of whether a product exceeds California’s or any other legal standard—they are meant to indicate which products had comparatively higher levels of heavy metals. Our results are shown by category in the charts in each section below. We list the percentages of the standard MADL levels for lead and cadmium supplied in one serving of the foods. While both heavy metals increase the risk of serious health problems, products within each category are listed in order of lead level, because that heavy metal poses particular concerns and no amount of it is considered safe. Dark Chocolate When we tested dark chocolate bars last year, we found lead or cadmium levels above CR’s thresholds in 23 of 28 bars, or 82 percent of them. Our results this time were similar. Of the seven bars we tested, five, or 71 percent, were above our levels for lead, cadmium, or both. Two bars—Divine 70% Deliciously Smooth Dark Chocolate and Sam’s Choice (Walmart) Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa—fell below CR’s levels for both lead and cadmium, based on a serving of about 1 ounce. (The following bars also came in below our thresholds when we tested them last year: Ghirardelli Intense Dark Chocolate 86% Cacao, Ghirardelli Intense Dark Chocolate Twilight Delight 72% Cacao, Mast Organic Dark Chocolate 80% Cocoa, Taza Chocolate Organic Deliciously Dark Chocolate 70% Cacao, and Valrhona Abinao Dark Chocolate 85% Cacao.) Eating an ounce of four others would put you over our limit for lead. The Perugina Premium Dark Chocolate bars had the highest amounts. One of the four, Evolved Signature Dark 72% Cacao Chocolate Bar was high in both lead and cadmium. Another bar, Sam’s Choice Dark Chocolate 72% Cocoa, was high in cadmium only. Nestlé, which owns Perugina, told CR, “We apply strict standards to ensure our products are high quality and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including limits for cadmium and lead.” And Rick Gusmano, co-founder of Evolved Chocolate, said the company’s chocolate products fall well below levels set in the As You Sow settlement and that the company “regularly tests raw materials and finished goods to ensure compliance and, ultimately, consumer safety.” Other makers of dark chocolate with high levels of lead or cadmium did not respond to a request for comment.

And in fact none of the five milk chocolate bars in our tests were over CR’s limit for either heavy metal. Hershey’s Milk Chocolate bar had the most lead, reaching 67 percent of CR’s limit. Feastables Mr. Beast Bar Milk Chocolate, with 80 percent of CR’s limit, had the most cadmium per serving. Lindt Classic Recipe Milk Chocolate Bar was the lowest overall, with one serving (about 1 ounce) containing 11 percent of the daily maximum amount of lead and 13 percent of the daily cadmium limit.

But there’s a caveat: The serving size for chocolate chips is just around ½ ounce (about 1 tablespoon)—the amount you might expect to get in a cookie or two, depending on the size of the cookie. If you’re the type that likes to eat more than a few cookies, or a handful of chips straight out of the bag, with many of these you could exceed the daily limits for both cadmium and lead by eating just two servings. Some good options for snacking that are relatively low in both heavy metals are 365 Whole Foods Market Semi-Sweet Chocolate Baking Chips, Kirkland Signature Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, and Nestlé Toll House Semi-Sweet Morsels. A spokesperson for Hu told CR that our test results were in line with the company’s own testing, but added that those levels fall far below those set in the As You Sow lawsuit settlement. Target did not respond to a request for comment. Chocolate Chip ResultsBased on the manufacturer's recommended serving size of 1 tablespoon.

But none of those we tested were high in cadmium, and only two had high levels of lead. Most of the cocoa powders in our tests were natural-style—the kind most commonly available in the U.S.—and of those, a serving (1 tablespoon) of Hershey’s Cocoa Naturally Unsweetened 100% Cacao exceeded our lead limit. Droste Cacao Powder was the only Dutch processed cocoa in our tests. This type of cocoa is alkalized to give it a less bitter taste. It was also the highest in lead of any product in our tests, supplying 324 percent of CR’s limit. The best cocoa powder overall was Navitas Organics Organic Cacao Powder, which reached 77 percent of CR’s lead limit and 17 percent of the cadmium limit. Navitas has a third party test all finished products for heavy metals to ensure low levels, according to the company website. Neither Droste nor Hershey responded to a request for comment. Cocoa Powder ResultsBased on the manufacturer's recommended serving size of 1 tablespoon. Ordered from lower to higher lead level.Below 100% of CR's levelsAbove 100% of CR's levels Navitas Organics Organic Cacao Powder LEAD 77% CADMIUM 17% Nestlé Toll House 100% Pure Cocoa LEAD 77% CADMIUM 66% BetterBody Foods Organic Cacao Powder LEAD 95% CADMIUM 95% 365 Whole Foods Market Organic Cocoa Powder LEAD 97% CADMIUM 93% Hershey's Cocoa Naturally Unsweetened 100% Cacao LEAD 125% CADMIUM 18% Droste Cacao Powder LEAD 324% CADMIUM 41% Hot Chocolate Mixes These mixes contain cocoa powder plus sugar and other ingredients, so we expected that they would be relatively low in lead and cadmium. That’s not what we found. Four of the six mixes we tested exceeded our lead limit: Great Value (Walmart) Milk Chocolate Flavor Hot Cocoa Mix, had the highest levels, with mixes from Trader Joe’s and Nestlé (which also makes hot chocolate mix for Starbucks), above CR’s cutoff. The Nestlé spokesperson said that the company stands by the safety of its products and that it works with its “suppliers on an ongoing basis to closely monitor and minimize the presence of these substances in our foods as much as possible.” Other makers of hot chocolate with high levels of lead did not respond to requests for comment. Hot Chocolate ResultsBased on each manufacturer's recommended serving size, which varies, as shown below. Ordered from lower to higher lead level.Below 100% of CR's levelsAbove 100% of CR's levels Ghirardelli Premium Hot Cocoa MixServing size: 3 Tbsp.

LEAD 345% CADMIUM 13% Brownie and Cake Mixes These products fared well overall in our tests. None were high in cadmium, and just one brownie mix and two cake mixes exceeded CR’s lead limits—one by quite a bit. One serving of Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix had 216 percent. The heavy metal levels refer to the amounts of the mix that are in one serving of the finished cake or brownie. (We list the number of servings each mix makes in the charts below.) However, the serving sizes are small. For instance, Duncan Hines Devil’s Food Cake mix makes a cake that the manufacturer says will serve 10. The company’s Double Fudge Brownie mix makes 20 servings. If your cake or brownie portions are more generous, keep in mind that you’ll be getting more lead and cadmium than we list here. Bob’s Red Mill, Simple Mills, and Ghirardelli did not respond to requests for comment. Brownie Mix ResultsBased on each manufacturer's recommended serving size, which varies.

There are ways for manufacturers to reduce the heavy metals in their products—such as sourcing chocolate from areas that have low levels of cadmium in the soil, and making improvements in cocoa harvesting, processing, and cleaning procedures. CR reached out to an industry trade group as well as the Food and Drug Administration for comment. “Chocolate and cocoa are safe to eat and can be enjoyed as treats, as they have been for centuries,” says Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, a candy industry group. “Food safety and product quality remain our highest priorities, and we remain dedicated to being transparent and socially responsible.” The Food and Drug Administration told CR that “While the presence of cadmium and lead in chocolate has been the subject of considerable media attention, experts from around the world have found that chocolate is a minor source of exposure to these contaminants internationally.” And the agency added that “ all food manufacturers and processors are responsible for ensuring the safety of their food.\" Our results, however, show that some companies may be doing a better job of keeping metals out of their products than others. That’s true even for dark chocolate and cocoa powders. “In general, products with higher cocoa content tend to have higher levels of metals, but not always,” says Eric Boring, PhD, a CR chemist who oversaw our chocolate tests. “There’s enough variation in the lead levels within each category of foods that it’s clear factors other than cocoa content affect lead levels, and that means manufacturers have the ability to reduce the heavy metals in their products to the lowest levels possible.” For example, if Navitas Organic Cacao can be lower in lead, Boring says, why can’t Hershey’s make a cocoa powder that is lower in the heavy metal, too? Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at CR, adds that \"Earlier this year, a Hershey executive stated that the company continues to look for ways to remove more of the metals through additional cleaning and alternate sourcing. We would like for them to honor that commitment.\" “Since the metals occur naturally in soil, it may seem that it would be difficult to reduce contamination, but there are some steps that chocolate makers can take to make their products safer,” Ronholm says. These include sourcing from areas with lower levels and mixing beans from different areas to ensure that the final product has lower levels. Producers could also test lots of cocoa to identify problem areas and reject particularly contaminated lots, he says. Making Healthier Choices • As much as possible, it makes sense to try to avoid heavy metals in your diet—but that doesn’t mean you should never eat chocolate. • Kids and pregnant people should consume dark chocolate sparingly, if at all, because heavy metals pose the highest risk to young children and developing babies. And if you do eat it, pick products that our tests showed to have lower levels of heavy metals. When consuming other cocoa-containing items—like hot chocolate or brownies—it may be best to limit these to not every day, and also choose products lower in heavy metals. And, of course, you should limit how much you eat other foods that tend to be high in heavy metals, such as rice and rice products, carrots, and sweet potatoes. • Milk chocolate can be a fine alternative for those who want to limit heavy metal exposure, but don’t treat it as a health food—it’s packed with more sugar than dark chocolate, and should still be consumed in moderation. • For other adults who want to eat dark chocolate, occasional consumption won’t necessarily expose you to extremely high levels of heavy metals. But as much as possible, try to be aware of potential metal exposure from multiple sources. For more tips, see our previous article on metals in chocolate. • When consuming hot chocolate, brownies, chocolate cake, and other cocoa-containing products, know that they can contribute to your overall heavy metal burden. As with other types of chocolate, these are best consumed in moderation.

Or shut down half the cacao farms worldwide because of tainted soil?Or is this pretty much in line with food safety levels generally, there&#x27;s nothing to be worried about, and California guidelines are overly strict?I just find it unfortunate that the article presents all the facts but basically zero analysis or context. reply chris_va 17 hours agoparent(disclaimer: I make bean-to-bar chocolate)As background, food often concentrates whatever is in the soil, and cacao perhaps more so. The shell around the cacao bean is a big filter, and tends to accumulate stuff. This concentration isn&#x27;t specific to cacao, e.g. see rice and arsenic, etc etc.Volcanic soil naturally has a lot of cadmium, for example, so you end up with it in the final product for cacao from some regions. The growing areas more popular with large manufacturers (i.e. cheaper cacao) just so happens to be areas with high cadmium levels, so there is a a bit of a correlation between cadmium levels and the size of the operation.I&#x27;ve been told that pretty much all larger chocolate organizations do test each batch for cadmium, lead, etc. The smaller ones are usually sourcing cacao from higher quality distributors, and those distributors also test everything (and also do transparency reports on labor, handling, and such).Fundamentally, the guidance on what is an acceptable level is not clear, though I cannot speak for the decision making at the companies listed in the article. CA&#x27;s particular threshold considered low, and you can get equal amounts of Cd&#x2F;Pb from a lot of other food sources (generally people don&#x27;t eat multiple chocolate bars per day, but they might have a cup of rice and get a similar amount of cadmium). Maybe that&#x27;s also a problem.Lead though, really should not be in there. It&#x27;s not from the soil, and it&#x27;s mostly in the shell, which should be removed in processing. reply tomcam 15 hours agorootparentGreat post. I’m dying to know what company you have&#x2F;work for? Theo by any chance? AFAIK bean to bar is highly unusual, done by only a dozen or so companies.

Very cool! reply schoen 14 hours agorootparentprevI was told a few years ago that bean-to-bar was done by very few companies. But I&#x27;ve since heard that it&#x27;s had kind of an explosion that somewhat parallels the popularity of beer microbreweries, with a huge boom in sales of chocolate-making equipment. reply navels 7 hours agorootparentBased on the turnout at the Northwest Chocolate Festival last month, I can confirm it has exploded :-) reply Panoramix 14 hours agorootparentprevI put about a tablespoon of cacao nibs in my breakfast cereal every morning. They are tasty and high in fiber. I guess I have to do some calculations on cadmium exposure. reply foobiekr 14 hours agorootparentprevI thought the lead was from beans left outdoors to ferment near machinery &#x2F; vehicles &#x2F; industrial sites with lead in the emissions. reply chris_va 5 hours agorootparentYes (usually drying, less so fermenting), which varies a lot country to country. Still, mostly it should end up in the shell that is removed. reply lippihom 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m just always blown away by the niche expertise you find on here!

That doesn&#x27;t sound great. reply adrian_b 17 hours agorootparentActually products like white flour or white rice have significantly less contaminants than whole grains.I do not agree with the propaganda about whole grains being healthy. Whole grains have more contaminants and more anti-nutrients, e.g. phytic acid.Whole grains would be healthier in comparison with white flour or white rice only for someone who would eat nothing else, and even then they would not be healthy enough.A healthy diet should include processed grains like white flour or white rice as a source of cheap proteins and of energy and it should also include some sources of healthy fat and many other sources for the nutrients that are necessary only in small quantities, like vitamins, minerals or proteins rich in lysine (which is insufficient in cereals). Whole-grain products have inflated prices, while a combination of e.g. white flour with various vegetables is simultaneously cheaper and healthier.Relying on whole grains to provide what is missing in white flour or white rice is completely inefficient and it also adds the risk of an excessive intake of contaminants. reply nikkwong 14 hours agorootparentWhat you&#x27;re missing here is that whole grains (or whole foods in general) are biologically active with phytochemicals such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, lingans, etc, which their processed counterparts generally have less of (or none at all). These compounds get into our body and then work in many ways (many of which that we don&#x27;t fully understand) to improve important markers of human health.Plant food is biologically active in ways that animal products are not, and I think people who eat exclusively meat as a source of protein are missing out on a lot of opportunity from the chemical activity of plants that has been shown to be health promoting.Whole foods do have more antinutrients but in studies I&#x27;ve seen most authors conclude that the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I agree that I am concerned about the metals in whole foods though; and careful sourcing is important (and even then sometimes insufficient). reply adrian_b 12 hours agorootparentThere are many other vegetables, from which other parts than the seeds are eaten, and which provide large amounts of biologically active phytochemicals.Seeds, like those of cereals or of legumes, are a necessary part of food because they are the only part of the plants with high content of proteins.Because of their disadvantage of also concentrating pollutants, it is preferable to use them mainly as a source of proteins and starch, which does not require the use of whole grains, and to get any desirable phytochemicals from other parts of plants.In the case of oily seeds, the extracted oils (if they are obtained by cold pressing or supercritical carbon dioxide extraction) contain most of the phytochemicals but much less of the heavy metals. For instance, cold-pressed sunflower oil is a better source of phytochemicals than raw sunflower seeds, because the latter, like cocoa, have frequently high contents of lead and cadmium.So there are ways of processing that improve the quality of the food ingredients. The kinds of processing that are bad are typically those which add undesirable substances to food, not those which remove undesirable substances from food. reply xhrpost 13 hours agorootparentprevIn addition to some of the other comments here mentioning whole grain benefits, I remember doing some brief research here and seeing that processed grains like white rice or white bread tend to be inflammatory while brown rice and whole grain bread are anti-inflammatory.

It’s extremely complex. Just like coffee, tea, wine, beer, vanilla, spirits, cheese, mushrooms (and so on; basically any luxury food). We can’t synthesize what makes these things taste good because it isn’t just one compound, it’s thousands.Even something very basic you can make at home, such as caramel, can’t be synthesized.

Regulators can just set a level deemed \"safe\" and it falls on the corporations to either offer a safe product or, if they are unable or unwilling to meet the standard, find a new way to make money that doesn&#x27;t involve the mass poisoning of the American public.We could bring just about any random person in off the street and have them consult with medical experts to develop the standards. In fact, the farther away from the food industry that person is the better.I&#x27;d argue that the more a regulatory agency is focused on the health and safety of the consumer, the less important it is for the regulators to be intimately familiar with the industry being regulated. At least, when we&#x27;re already aware of the health problems and know what to test for. Industry insiders may be able to help identify products or chemicals in cases where companies know they are selling dangerous products and are hiding that information from the public, but it seems that someone with close ties to the industry wouldn&#x27;t be very likely to act as a whistleblower in those cases anyway. reply dang 14 hours agoprevRelated.

There’s a cacao tree and it grows pods (similar in size and shape to a small American football) and these pods contain beans surrounded by pulp. These pods are cut from the cacao tree, the mushy pulp is allowed to ferment and dry over a period of many days, and then the beans from desiccated pod are what ultimately get transformed into powder and then we get what is referred to as the cocoa butter—-from cacao tree to cocoa butter. Finally, it’s a complex process of churning the cocoa butter with the addition of milk and lecithin to get the tasty end product chocolate. In most cases it is mostly milk chocolate and lecithin with a smaller percent of cocoa butter.The native origins of Cacao trees are in the Amazon region (Brazil, Colombia, Peru) but have a rich history of being transplanted to other regions around the world since colonial times, largely for commercialization. In present day, the top growers of cacao trees are in Africa. 70% of the world’s cocoa come from Cameroon, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Ghana.The CR article fails to make the connection as to where in the lifecycle the heavy metals are introduced. reply ses1984 16 hours agoparentI’m pretty sure the heavy metals are introduced from the soils in certain regions, maybe most regions, where cacao is grown.I think you may have applied a little unnecessary pedantry. In many languages there is only one word used to describe the tree and the finished product, and that’s most of the time enough to figure out what people are talking about in context. reply hbarka 16 hours agorootparentAmong nutritionists and cooks, there is a big distinction. There’s cacao powder and there’s cocoa powder. There’s also a big difference between cocoa versus chocolate, which is really milk chocolate.The real question is which soils contain the pollutants. Is there a statistical significance among cacao trees grown in the Amazon region versus African region, for example, and why. reply ses1984 14 hours agorootparentOk, but it’s pretty obvious to anyone reading that cocoa plant and cacao plant refer to the same thing. And if the only difference between cocoa powder and cacao powder is the heat used in processing, I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t change the heavy metal content, so it’s irrelevant.It’s funny your make such a big deal out of this and then say something like “chocolate is really milk chocolate.” reply hbarka 13 hours agorootparent> the only difference between cocoa powder and cacao powder is the heatand this is why it’s important to know your cocoa from cacaoGrape vine - grape fruit - wineCacao tree - cacao bean - cocoa reply crazygringo 15 hours agoparentprev> For instance, they wrote “cocoa plant” but there’s no such. There’s a cacao tree...Cacao and cocoa are more interchangeable than you think:> Theobroma cacao (cacao tree or cocoa tree) [1]The usage shifts according to country and industry.

They point out that no level of cadmium is safe... so how can they say it&#x27;s okay to eat Sam&#x27;s Choice chocolate? Maybe they need to describe their limit choice better. It seems like they might have tested everything then chosen their limit so that half the products were okay. reply queuebert 18 hours agoprevOn the plus side, these tainted chocolate bars provide better X-ray shielding. reply BaculumMeumEst 19 hours agoprevlike the article says, the takeaway isn&#x27;t to panic, but just to consider dark chocolate a food you don&#x27;t overindulge in. obviously you want to avoid contaminants, but some degree of exposure is part of life, and it&#x27;s the dose that makes the poison. reply davzie 19 hours agoparentI know I&#x27;m spending too long on HN when I start panicking about every day normal things to consume or do incase it poisons me, causes cancer, gives me alzheimer&#x27;s or something else that makes top page posts. The health-nut side of HN is what lets it down and makes it a depressing place to hang out in. reply BaculumMeumEst 18 hours agorootparentthe problem is these submissions are incentivized to scare the shit out of you, but not to be honest about “how worried you should be about it”. this heavily applies to MSM stories as well.once i understood that, i got more aggressive about hiding this kind of content, or taking it with a huge grain of salt. reply Pigalowda 18 hours agorootparentprevJust eat a balanced diet and exercise. Don’t smoke, drink, or do drugs (if you do then do them sparingly). Everything else won’t move the needle and should be mostly ignored - someone is selling you something or gaining a click.Luckily for the American health care industry people ignore that advice and do their very level best to oppose it at every turn. reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparent> Just eat a balanced diet and exercise.I&#x27;ve never seen a particularly good definition for \"balanced diet\", and many communities that are super healthy have diets that don&#x27;t look balanced at all. reply davzie 18 hours agorootparentprevWell a big green tick for me on all those points. Thanks for being a voice of reason! reply Blackthorn 19 hours agoparentprevThere is no safe level of lead exposure, though. reply Aurornis 18 hours agorootparentThis absolutist stance made sense when our equipment wasn’t sensitive enough to detect low levels reliably. A lot of reports would literally say “not detected” and it would be interpreted as “not present”Modern equipment and techniques can reliably detect very low levels of lead. Nearly every chocolate product will contain some tiny level of lead.There are 469 entries on this database: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asyousow.org&#x2F;environmental-health&#x2F;toxic-enforcem...Only a handful of them were so low that it’s listed as not detected. I’m sure if they were motivated, they could have used more sensitive equipment to quantify the actual level of lead in those products too.That’s why it’s no longer useful to insist that there is no safe level of lead, because you’re going to be consuming tiny amounts of lead in anything you eat or drink. Past a small enough threshold the effects really are negligible. reply Obscurity4340 18 hours agorootparentThis issue I sense with respect to whether there are truly any safe exposure amounts is that the moment you say anything greater than zero, you give wiggle room for companies (hell, even governments and regulatory bodies in general) to fuck around and pretend their negligence in allowing an-after-the-fact higher amount product was due to some arbitrary reason that ignores the fact that there really shouldn&#x27;t be any of the thing at all for practical purposes and that, consequently, this thing really can&#x27;t exist or be allowed to continue being marketed. Folks interested in the language that this evokes have zero issue doing this with drugs, why so serious (in terms of incompetency) with respect to this? reply Aurornis 17 hours agorootparent> This issue I sense with respect to whether there are truly any safe exposure amounts is that the moment you say anything greater than zero,If you set all of the limits at zero, we wouldn&#x27;t be eating anything.You wouldn&#x27;t even be eating vegetables from your own garden. reply Obscurity4340 16 hours agorootparentThe point I&#x27;m trying to make is when you have any tolerance at all for hard no things like lead, it only extends the Overton window of regulation so far, to the point where you&#x27;re allowing for a defense when it needs to be an absolute liabillity. Lead intoxication (both acutely and chronic) is an absolutely castastrophic public health problem. It has to be absolutley unacceptable and legally made to essentially be indefensible where it can be objectively proven a chain of events flows from commercial activity of defendant company to the inclusion (or failure to remove it from) the product and seperately for any harm that results to customers.If no company can legit handle the liabillity aspect then it needs to be like nuclear weapons and \"handled by the government\" even though that opens its own range of potential issues. That is the least-worst arbiter and threat actor who handle&#x27;s other such things. reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparentPaying for damages sounds like that&#x27;s also allowing nonzero amounts.And I don&#x27;t know what you mean by the government handling it. Surely you don&#x27;t mean the government handles all food production, but I can&#x27;t figure out how else to interpret that.Lying about tolerances in service of an overton fight is not something that sounds very good to me. reply Obscurity4340 12 hours agorootparent> lying about tolerancesWat? reply Dylan16807 11 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re saying we can&#x27;t tolerate nonzero amounts.As pointed out, actually doing that would mean no food.Since you brought up the overton window, it sounds like you want to claim we don&#x27;t tolerate any at all, while actually tolerating it so people can eat. That would be lying. reply Obscurity4340 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I said that at all. I disagree with whatever it was you said to the effect that I believe laws likely currenty have the general anticipated and sometimes also measured quantities of heavy metals and other toxins that regulation built-in to the laws themselves in a sort of dual-chicken-egg type deal. I agree with you that the government just can&#x27;t let the \"regulate to the point of the people&#x27;s starvation from overregulation conducted by a fundamentally incompetent govermment\" happen. Just cuz I&#x27;m a dreamer doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m dreaming when it comes to RealPolitik.I&#x27;m just saying that, there needs to be more buy-in from industries everywhere to self-police and just do the right fucking thing more often that not and almost always if even nominally possible. Giving companies loopholes and allowing other retarded parlor games in corporate governance and whatever the hell else is done in and by large corporations that ends up affecting us all in the end always. And its disproportionate, they often get off with the golden loot and we all have to hold the bag and split the post-mortem costs reply Obscurity4340 6 hours agorootparentprevLook, if you&#x27;re correct that there is and will inevitably be minute traces of lead throughout the food supply and you&#x27;re implying that this is not a reality that can be changed because its basically just how it is on a basically molecular model, than yeah we can&#x27;t necessarily make it full-blown absolute liabillity.That sure as hell doesn&#x27;t mean that concessions aren&#x27;t made on the part of operating companiea to ensure their windfall in removing the biggest threat to their business upon discovery of their future criminal wrong-doing does not being part of their operations. Like how that company in China added some bullshit additive to baby formula that ended killing and maiming a bunch of Chinese babies.The absolute balls firstly, but second, they had lots of splaining to do as if thry were in AbsoluteLiabillityNation, which China&#x27;s legal system certainly seems to be. Heads rolled off to prison disgraced and disrobed economically speaking and I&#x27;ll bet they don&#x27;t have a similar crisis for a good long time but obviously the odds of fraud there, like anywhere else, tend towards non-zero... replyrefurb 5 hours agorootparentprevHere is a good paper on that issue: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4116340&#x2F;The best detection method can now measure below 1 part per trillion. That&#x27;s one microgram of lead in 1 kilogram of material. reply jksflkjl3jk3 19 hours agorootparentprevHow are you defining a \"safe level\"?Everyone in the world has been exposed to some amount of lead and most live out relatively long and healthy lives. reply rgrieselhuber 19 hours agorootparentComments like these are always so annoying to be honest.It takes the responsibility off the food manufacturers to do really simple things like, let’s not put toxic chemicals in food, and instead writes the whole thing down with flimsy statements like “well you’re already poisoned to some degree, should be fine though.” reply smegger001 18 hours agorootparentBut its not entirely wrong there is some natural background level of expected exposure for things like lead, arsenic, mercury, etc as they are naturally occurring part of our environment. wanting to know what the floor is when talking about exposure to these toxins helps you understand the scale of exposure. reply rgrieselhuber 18 hours agorootparentIn what environment should we be expected to naturally encounter lead, arsenic, and mercury? reply jandrewrogers 17 hours agorootparentArsenic is naturally found in most water to varying degrees. It is an essential but poorly understood micronutrient. Its toxicity is similar to selenium, another essential micronutrient, so it isn&#x27;t unique in terms of the dose response. Some plants concentrate it but that usually isn&#x27;t bioavailable.Background lead levels are sometimes high naturally but those geographies are relatively rare. Lead is usually industrial pollution.Mercury chemistry in nature tends to have very poor bioavailability. Dietary mercury is almost exclusively industrial pollution where mercury is integrated into molecules that are much more bioavailable. reply Herodotus38 18 hours agorootparentprevArsenic levels in soil can naturally vary depending on minerals under the soil. So you can get more if say you are eating a root vegetable that you need to wash the dirt off vs less from an above ground vegetable.Unfortunately I have learned a lot about this bc our region has unnaturally elevated levels of lead and arsenic die to pesticide use in the past. But can also just be bad luck and natural.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK231016&#x2F;#:~:text=The%20.... reply jksflkjl3jk3 18 hours agorootparentprevJust about anywhere in the world that&#x27;s not a sterilized room. reply rgrieselhuber 18 hours agorootparentI still think it’s a disingenuous argument because we’re talking about elevated levels in food production. reply smegger001 17 hours agorootparentNot really for example there a naturally occuring high levels of arsenic in the ground water and soil near near cooks inlet Alaska, there&#x27;s lead in Idaho, and cinnabar (a naturally occuring mercury contain mineral) in California, uranium in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Wyoming. reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not disingenuous when people are talking about treating any level like an elevated level. replyjksflkjl3jk3 18 hours agorootparentprevMy point is that your requirement can&#x27;t be absolutely zero lead. If you have sensitive enough equipment, you&#x27;re always going to detect some amount of common contaminants.> let’s not put toxic chemicals in foodYou make it sound like adding lead is an intentional act. Surely if it required no effort, food manufacturers would remove all of the lead. I don&#x27;t know how much effort is required, but reports like this and testing by regulators is likely required to encourage them to put in more effort to get the lead down to a reasonable level. reply rgrieselhuber 18 hours agorootparentSounds like a regulatory problem. replyObscurity4340 18 hours agoparentprevIts kind of ironic that dark chocolate is more a rich person&#x27;s thing on a practical level and that the shittier the chocolate (in the sense of real chocolate content which is heavily used as a proxy for quality), the safer it might be reply lo_zamoyski 17 hours agorootparentNot the first time.

I think that is one of Snowflake&#x27;s (many) value propositions. It is also a goal for users to be able to have full control of their data, how it is processed, and be able to make economical use of their compute.This project does not have a goal of matching anyone else&#x27;s features. But of course, as we grow, we&#x27;ll end up building things which are important to enterprises. reply willseth 12 hours agorootparentCalling it \"Open-Source Snowflake\" implies you are trying to be a drop-in replacement for Snowflake for at least a subset of features, SQL syntax, etc. reply skeeter2020 13 hours agorootparentprevI too was confused by the title.

[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratchdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;flatten-json&#x2F; reply memset 13 hours agoparentThis is a really good question. My snarky answer is \"the way we ingest JSON doesn&#x27;t require 50 pages and n configuration settings to explain.\"Here&#x27;s a more factual one:- We don&#x27;t use tuples for nested JSON. We just use underscores to show parent_child relationships in keys.- We don&#x27;t use arrays. Instead, we make it easy to split into multiple rows so you can use regular SQL.I haven&#x27;t directly compared Clickhouse&#x27;s all of different JSON treatments compared to what I&#x27;ve implemented, but my goal was to build something that you could run and would \"just work the way it should.\" reply antoniojtorres 13 hours agorootparentClickHouse JSON certainly has some sharp edges because they do a lot of schema inference to transparently column store the component parts, which makes it tricky with anything that could be irregular.Big fan of CH on my end.

Looks really interesting!I personally agree that real-time OLAP databases have potential to better serve workloads currently in Postgres or cloud data warehouses that need real-time ingest and analytical queries. And simplifying developer experience on top of that, so you don&#x27;t have to learn about all the details of a powerful database, really speeds up developer velocity.I&#x27;m curious, how you see your project differs from GraphJSON (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphjson.com&#x2F;) and Tinybird (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinybird.co&#x2F;)?Congratulations again on the launch! reply memset 15 hours agoparentGood to meet you! I hadn&#x27;t seen graphjson before, I&#x27;ll check that out. I&#x27;m also a fan of tinybird, and I think we have similar goals of wanting to make it easier for people to adopt OLAP.On the technical side, I&#x27;ve made different design decisions when it comes to ingesting and processing data. For example, after a table is created, you can post new JSON, with different columns, and we ingest it without needing a manual migration step. I also have a different treatment for JSON arrays, where we can split them into multiple Clickhouse rows (rather than using a clickhouse array.)Philosophically, I think there is a lot of room for open-source software that also has an amazing UI and developer experience. I&#x27;ve been writing OSS for years and basically think this is the best way to build successful developer tools. reply tbragin 15 hours agorootparent> Philosophically, I think there is a lot of room for open-source software that also has an amazing UI and developer experience.+1 to that!

This looks great. Inferring schemas on the fly is awesome to get started quickly, but are there ways to explicitly define a schema if I wanted to? For example, thinking of setting column specific compression reply memset 10 hours agoparentCurrently no, but I’m open to the idea of being able to set this. Perhaps the ability to set it on the fly (or better yet, inform the user of which type of compression to use based on their actual data!) would be useful. Happy to discuss in a gh issue too. reply didip 15 hours agoprevYou should submit your benchmarks to ClickBench. reply pitah1 10 hours agoprevThanks for sharing. Looks very clean and simple to use.Do you plan on supporting non-JSON data types for insertion?

You&#x27;ll just spend time supporting lots of connectors.Instead, recommend that users use another (connector heavy) tool to get data in -- my mind jumped to using Benthos to convert a CSV or parquet file (or any other input stream) into a series of JSON calls -- and just ask users to hammer ingestion requests at your server. From there, your job is \"just\" to handle JSON ingestion as fast as you can, rather than maintain many connectors.If JSON becomes a problem, then find exactly one other well-defined file format for bulk data loads (parquet, perhaps?), and support that.When I saw this submission, I think I fell in love. JSON to get data in; SQL to get data out; what could be simpler? reply pitah1 9 hours agorootparentAgreed. I guess it depends on the target market. If your target is small to medium sized businesses, this is great to start doing analytics. But for large organisations, they generally have ETL&#x2F;ELT jobs that do all the extraction from data sources to push to an analytics store or save in some format that is performant for analytics and storage (i.e. parquet). I&#x27;m also not sure how many data visualisation tools support API endpoints for query serving. reply OmarAssadi 8 hours agoprev> The whole thing runs on regular servers. Hetzner has become our cloud of choice, along with Backblaze B2 and SQS. It is written in Go. From an architecture perspective I try to keep things simple - want folks to make economical use of their servers.Cool, glad to see Hetzner, at least presumably for compute, rather than the almost routine, absurdly expensive, mega cloud providers.I have a few questions if you&#x27;ve got time.1. What made you pick Hetzner in particular, and did you evaluate any of their primary competitors? (e.g., OVH, etc)2. In your $100&#x2F;month figure, did you decide to go with dedicated servers or the \"cloud\" VPS line? If the latter, was there any particular reason over going with the bare-metal offerings?3. Are you making use of Hetzner&#x27;s U.S. servers as well or is everything currently in Europe (or vice-versa)?4. Was there any particular reason for choosing B2 and SQS as opposed to self-hosting object-storage on the SX servers?Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t even wonder why someone wouldn&#x27;t want the burden of more infrastructure. But given the choice of going with relatively unmanaged Hetzner servers, presumably self-hosting clickhouse, etc, and then with your compute provider also happening to offer fairly large storage servers on the cheap, I might&#x27;ve been tempted to cut out the additional providers and DIY it:- less costly for large amounts of data- zero lock-in [1]- fewer companies to deal with - likely better negotiating power with Hetzner when the time comes if a bigger percentage of your overhead is with them as opposed to spread out across three providers - fewer points of failure; if the Hetzner servers are down, I would assume you&#x27;re in trouble anyway, so perhaps keeping [most] of your eggs on the same network might not be as bad as it sounds - presumably better latency and bandwidth + the ability to communicate over a private network [2]5. I see the license is AGPL. But I don&#x27;t see the usual \"you must dual-license all contributions under MIT&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;ISC as well [so that only we can re-license the project]\" nor \"before contributing, sign this agreement transferring copyright [and your first born child]\".Was this just an oversight, or do you intend to be one of the few SaaS companies that really truly is open-source rather than \"open-source\" [until peopled are locked-in] and then going \"open\"-core? If the latter, then awesome -- cool to see.6. Any regrets, disasters, or lessons learned so far? Usually, I find these stories the most interesting but unfortunately too few are willing to share.---[1]: I know B2 provides a relatively standard, at this point, S3-compatible API and everything as well. But I think there is also still something to be said about a somewhat Juche-esque approach to infrastructure, wherein should prices rise, contracts change, service degrades, or whatever else, you&#x27;d have the ability to almost immediately switch at a moment&#x27;s notice to literally anyone else who can lease you a box with some hard drives or any colo provider.[2]: This goes out the window somewhat if you&#x27;re using the VPS line and American servers, though. reply memset 7 hours agoparentReally interesting question(s)! Will try to answer the gist.First, the system is designed for users to be able to drop in whatever hardware they want. So your questions are around my initial deployment options. These will certainly change in the future.I chose Hetzner because of cost. I will probably end up using other providers in the future but Hetzner let me begin this experiment without burning my runway.I use metal servers for Clickhouse, and small cloud boxes and LBs for the API. It happens I&#x27;m using US-based cloud servers because that&#x27;s where my users are.I&#x27;m using B2 + SQS because I did not want to take on sysadmin for those components. They are not performance-sensitive. Using B2 at $0.006&#x2F;GB vs managing minio on an SX server at $0.001&#x2F;GB was acceptable to me :)Why use regular servers for the API instead of fly.io? Because the API writes data to disk, and then bulk loads it to clickhouse. This means I needed durable and reliable disk, which you can only have with actual VMs. I didn&#x27;t want the process to be randomly SIGKILL&#x27;d since the process shuts down safely to avoid data loss, and I didn&#x27;t want the risk of ephemeral storage. So to control all this I have to run the HTTP servers myself.I might experiment with a PaaS for this, but it was easy enough to just set up an init script to run the daemon.re: negotiating power - that conversation only happens when I have volume, at which point I will be able to negotiate with any provider.re: points of failure&#x2F;latency - this will continually change: the deployment strategy for today will be different than when I&#x27;m managing 100s of TB of data across thousands of users. The main focus is to make the system flexible to handle different topologies and to be able to change providers by updating a configuration.Thank you! reply jed_sanders12 13 hours agoprevThis looks great. I have one question. When you are automatically creating tables, how do you choose primary keys order for clickhouse table? reply memset 13 hours agoparentGreat question. Each new table is given a __row_id column which ScratchDB populates and that is the default primary key.Then, as data is added, I look at the cardinality of each column and set an ORDER BY appropriately. The goal (implementation in progress, not launched yet) is for ScratchDB to do this automatically - we should be able to automatically look at both the data in your table and queries and analytically come up with an appropriate sorting key. reply jed_sanders12 13 hours agorootparentThis sounds like a very interesting problem. How costly is it to modify order by after data has been loaded into the table? It sounds expensive because it should reorder the data after changing order by. reply memset 13 hours agorootparentIt is not a cheap operation, I basically create a new table and then \"INSERT INTO SELECT...\" Then again, it isn&#x27;t something you typically need to do a lot. reply jed_sanders12 13 hours agorootparentThank you for the answers, and best of luck with this product. replyesafak 16 hours agoprevTiDB is an HTAP whose OLAP component (TiFlash) was based on Clickhouse: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23584022If you have analyzed the competition, what are your selling points?

How does your compute price compare to bigtable?Edit: bigtable->bigquery reply memset 14 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t bill separately for the compute vs storage the way bigtable does. The pricing per GB of data is inclusive of compute. The goal is for pricing to be modeled similarly to DynamoDB - just pay for what you use. The other way I charge is by query wall time - so a 30s query will cost you more than a 500ms one.I haven&#x27;t used bigtable but it seems like the minimum charge is on the order of $300 before you have any data. With ScratchDB, the minimum charge is $10 for 30 GB.Additionally, on average, data has a 25% compression ratio. So if your 1 TB of data only takes up 250GB, you only pay for that.Bigtable isn&#x27;t OLAP, so you would not use them for the same data. This competes more directly with GCP&#x27;s BigQuery.Finally, I&#x27;m interested in pricing feedback! The goal is to be able to sustain the development of this, so I want to do what makes sense. reply ddorian43 14 hours agorootparentI wrote wrong, I meant bigquery, sorry. It&#x27;s 9x of bigquery. reply memset 14 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t calculated the break-even point for bigquery vs scratchdb. It would be impossible to do so, as I&#x27;d need to know the number of rows bigquery will scan in order to do an estimation in advance. Also what is a \"slot-hour\"?That is why I chose pricing uses units of \"GB\" and \"hours\" for storage and compute - those are things you can more easily observe.It is a good question, though, and perhaps I can do an experiment and write a blog post using example data showing the differences. I might be surprised at how efficient bigquery is! reply wkoszek 15 hours agoprev [–] ScratchDB has save my business and it&#x27;s awesome.

    "originBody": "Explore Pricing Docs Blog Changelog Sign in Get started Generate images in one second on your Mac using a latent consistency model Posted October 25, 2023 by @fofr Latent consistency models (LCMs) are based on Stable Diffusion, but they can generate images much faster, needing only 4 to 8 steps for a good image (compared to 25 to 50 steps). By running an LCM on your M1 or M2 Mac you can generate 512x512 images at a rate of one per second. Simian Luo et al released the first Stable Diffusion distilled model. It’s distilled from the Dreamshaper fine-tune by incorporating classifier-free guidance into the model’s input. Only one model has been distilled so far, but more will be released. Stable Diffusion 2.1 and SDXL are being worked on by the paper authors. You can run the first latent consistency model in the cloud on Replicate, but it’s also possible to run it locally. As well as generating predictions, you can hack on it, modify it, and build new things. We’ve written this guide to help you get started. Prerequisites You’ll need: a Mac with an M1 or M2 chip 16GB RAM or more macOS 12.3 or higher Python 3.10 or above We’ve found that an M1 Max or M2 with 32GB RAM can generate images in 1 second. An M1 Pro with 16GB RAM can generate images in 2 to 4 seconds. Please share your benchmarks with us on our Github repository. Set up Python You need Python 3.10 or above. Run python -V to see what Python version you have installed: $ python3 -V Python 3.10.6 If it’s 3.10 or above, like here, you’re good to go! Skip on over to the next step. Otherwise, you’ll need to install Python 3.10. The easiest way to do that is with Homebrew. First, install Homebrew if you haven’t already. Then, install the latest version of Python: brew update brew install python Now if you run python3 -V you should have 3.10 or above. You might need to reopen your console to make it work. Clone the repository and install the dependencies Run this to clone the LCM script from Github: git clone https://github.com/replicate/latent-consistency-model.git cd latent-consistency-model Then, set up a virtualenv to install the dependencies: python3 -m pip install virtualenv python3 -m virtualenv venv Activate the virtualenv: source venv/bin/activate (You’ll need to run this command again any time you want to run the script.) Then, install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt Run it! Now, you can run your latent consistency model. The script will automatically download the SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7 (3.44 GB) and safety checker (1.22 GB) models from HuggingFace. python main.py \\ \"a beautiful apple floating in outer space, like a planet\" \\ --steps 4 --width 512 --height 512 You’ll see an output like this: Output image saved to: output/out-20231026-144506.png Using seed: 48404 100%|███████████████████████████| 4/4 [00:00<00:00, 5.54it/s] We’ve also added a --continous flag, so you can keep on generating image after image until your harddrive is full. Generations after the first one will run a bit faster too. python main.py \\ \"a beautiful apple floating in outer space, like a planet\" \\ --steps 4 --width 512 --height 512 --continuous That’s it! Next steps If you’re struggling to get this set up, or you aren’t getting fast speeds, ask in our Discord for some help. Or take a look at our Github repository.

Credits: Dr. Christopher Walker, NIAC Fellow / FreeFall Aerospace Some 30 years ago, a young engineer named Christopher Walker was home in the evening making chocolate pudding when he got what turned out to be a very serendipitous call from his mother. Taking the call, he shut off the stove and stretched plastic wrap over the pot to keep the pudding fresh. By the time he returned, the cooling air in the pot had drawn the wrap into a concave shape, and in that warped plastic, he saw something – the magnified reflection of an overhead lightbulb – that gave him an idea that could revolutionize space-based sensing and communications. That idea became the Large Balloon Reflector (LBR), an inflatable device that creates wide collection apertures that weigh a fraction of today’s deployable antennas. Now, with an assist from NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, funded by the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, which supports visionary innovations from diverse sources, Walker’s decades-old vision is coming to fruition. The concept turns part of the inside surface of an inflated sphere into a parabolic antenna. A section comprising about a third of the balloon’s interior surface is aluminized, giving it reflective properties. With NIAC funding, and a grant from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Walker was able to develop and demonstrate technologies for a 33-foot-diameter (10 meters) LBR that was carried to the stratosphere by a giant balloon. For comparison, the aperture of NASA’s massive James Webb Space Telescope is over 21 feet (6.5 meters) in diameter. “There was no place other than NIAC within NASA to get this off the ground,” says Walker, now a astronomy and optical engineering professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “At first, I was afraid to share the idea with colleagues because it sounded so crazy. You need a program within NASA that will actually look at the radical ideas, and NIAC is it.” Parabolic dish antennas use their concave shape to capture and concentrate electromagnetic radiation. The larger the antenna’s diameter, or aperture, the more effective it is for capturing light or radio waves and transmitting radio signals over great distances. In astronomy, there is a tremendous advantage to placing telescopes above the Earth’s atmosphere, which tends to distort or degrade signals coming from space. The challenge is that traditional large reflector antennas are heavy, unwieldy, and difficult to stow, leading to launch constraints and risky in-space deployment schemes. The LBR design solves both problems. Made of a thin film structure, it inflates like a beachball, providing a stable parabolic-dish shape without the need for bulky and complex deployable hardware, and can fold into a tiny volume. In 2018, Freefall Aerospace, a company co-founded by Walker to develop and market the technology, demonstrated the LBR’s potential aboard NASA’s stadium-sized stratospheric balloon, which carried a 3.28-foot scale model to an altitude of 159,000 feet. Next up for the technology is a high-speed communications demonstration in low Earth orbit aboard a 6-unit CubeSat, about the size of a shoebox, called CatSat. It was selected for flight in 2019 as part of NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative. It is a joint effort involving NASA, Freefall Aerospace, the University of Arizona, and Rincon Research Corporation in Tucson, Arizona. After reaching low-Earth orbit, CatSat’s inflatable antenna deployment system will deploy from its container, inflate to a diameter of about one-and-a-half feet, and begin transmitting back high-definition Earth photos. The mission is slated for launch with several other CubeSats on Firefly Aerospace’s Alpha rocket as part of the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) 43 mission. A more ambitious lunar mission concept is also being explored. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, would use the inflatable antenna in tandem with a new instrument called Terahertz Spectrometer for In-Situ Resource Utilization, a miniature, high-power laser precisely calibrated to detect water, a critical exploration resource. “The technology demonstrated by CatSat opens the door to the possibility of future lunar, planetary and deep-space missions using CubeSats,” said Walker. It might be difficult to believe this all started because a young engineer’s idea of dinner one evening was what most would consider dessert. Then again, one could say the proof was in the pudding.

H. Jones, under the pen name Daedalus, for one of his tongue-in-cheek columns in either New Scientist or Nature.IIRC, the scheme, for creating a large space telescope in situ, went something like this: 1) create a flat film of some uncured polymer resin, polymer solution or heat-softened plastic on a large ring; 2) inflate it into a hemispherical dome by applying moderate gas pressure on one side; 3) allow the material to harden; 4) release the pressure, which will cause the bubble to adopt a parabolic shape; 5) use ion beam deposition to apply a reflective surface. I can&#x27;t say whether my recollection of the geometrical claim on which this proposal is based is accurate, or, if so, whether it is correct.Most of Jones&#x27;s proposals were wildly yet entertainingly infeasible, but not always, and he is somewhat well known for conceiving of a form of 3-D printing (using a laser-polymerized monomer) before any serious proposals for the concept. There are a couple of collections of his Daedalus columns.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_E._H._Jones reply asimpleusecase 5 hours agoprevWhen I was a child , so a long time ago, at the Huntsville ( huntsville alabama )Space Museum they had a demo that was something that looked like a pie pan that was 10 feet across with Mylar stretched across it. And a tripod that was attached at the edge and stood over it. At the top there was a cone of metal and inside the cone was a copper tube that ran up one of the tripod legs and spiralled around the inside of the cone then ran down one of the other legs. They had a household vacuum cleaner attached to a tube at the bottom of the pie pan. When the turned on the vacuum the Mylar got sucked down and it made a parabolic surface. The sunshine was then focused into the cone and the turned on the water and it ran through the copper tube . It came out a stream of water for a few minutes but then turned to steam.

A parabolic surface is not closed, so you can&#x27;t inflate it like a beachball.So I&#x27;d like to know either: how they control the shape of the surface, so the mirrored portion is parabolic; or whether the antenna surface is actually spherical, and not parabolic at all.The portion of a parabolic mirror nearest the focus approximates to a sphere. If the deviation is less than 1&#x2F;4 wavelength of the signal of interest, a spherical mirror will focus the signal perfectly, as if it were a paraboloid.A paraboloid is what you need for distortion-free imaging; this antenna is apparently used only for signalling, so perhaps accuracy doesn&#x27;t matter, because only the gain is important.

The foldable&#x2F;inflatable part is only an advantage for aerospace applications where size and weight are at premium. reply eternauta3k 3 hours agorootparentA balloon is not necessarily spherical, see e.g. the long balloons for making balloon animals. reply uoaei 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;m a little confused because the article uses &#x27;spherical&#x27; and &#x27;parabolic&#x27; seemingly interchangeably. I&#x27;m sure the scientists know what they&#x27;re doing but just found the imprecision a bit odd for a nasa.gov article. reply istjohn 11 hours agoparentThis page states that it is spherical. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freefallaerospace.com&#x2F;nasa-balloon&#x2F; reply uoaei 10 hours agorootparentNice, thanks for finding that.Excerpt:> FreeFall’s antenna technology is unique because it is using a spherical reflector. In the past, antennas always used a parabolic antenna. A parabolic antenna focuses energy to a “single point” – while a spherical antenna focuses energy to a “focal line”. Parabolic antennas are symmetric about only one axis which severely limits field of view. It also requires precise pointing for high gain and has more complex packaging, deployment and on-orbit operations. The spherical antenna provides a wider field of view for antennas and high gain without re-pointing of an antenna. Combining a spherical antennas with inflatables is the key to achieving a large aperture in a simple lightweight system. reply sbierwagen 8 hours agorootparentKinda funny. Antenna gain is beam width. Antennas with large effective apertures have narrow beam widths.I can easily buy that it could be cheaper to launch a 50m spherical inflatable antenna than a rigid 25m parabolic antenna. But it&#x27;s never going to be true that a spherical antenna with the same gain as a parabolic will have a wider beam width. reply uoaei 6 hours agorootparentI assume some part of the \"focal line\" aspect changes that calculation. reply andreareina 11 hours agoparentprevI understood it as, the structure is spherical, with one parabolic surface that acts as the antenna. reply teo_zero 4 hours agorootparentNo, it&#x27;s spherical. Instead of a transceiver placed in the focal point, they use array of min. 3 transceivers. It will definitely not have the same gain of a parabolic of similar size, but it will be more flexible about where the target it aims at must be. They are advertising it not for communication from fixed point to fixed point, but rather between vehicles that are continously moving, where a less directional solution will be an advantage. reply smoyer 11 hours agoparentprevYou can also tune the secondary a bit through the design of the feed horn.

I wonder how robust it is to small debris, I assume it won&#x27;t pop but will the thin material fold up on itself if there&#x27;s a hole? reply morcheeba 11 hours agoparentThat was my first thought, too. My ideas was to make the plastic UV-curable so it would become rigid and not require inflation. I looked it up, and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing - UV-curable ribs. It&#x27;s also not a sphere; it has an inflatable ring. Pictures & paper here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asteroid.arizona.edu&#x2F;KABAND_Inflatable_v3_public.pdf reply Terr_ 12 hours agoparentprevI guess it depends on the odds (impacts per cross-section per time) for different debris size&#x2F;composition&#x2F;speeds in the planned orbit. I&#x27;m sure somebody&#x27;s studying that, but I&#x27;m also sure it must involve a lot of complicated tables.The particular mini-satellite is slated for a 6-month mission, so presumably they think it&#x27;ll survive at least that long. reply incompatible 8 hours agoprev“At first, I was afraid to share the idea with colleagues because it sounded so crazy.

At some point, a room full of risk-averse engineers all agreed that \"rocket crane\" is the safest and most practical solution to a problem. reply tigershark 9 hours agoprevI don’t think that the explanation is entirely correct. Inflating a balloon will produce a spherical antenna not a parabolic one. Now I don’t really remember the implication of using a spherical receiver for radio waves, but in case of light waves it’s necessary to use a parabolic reflector instead of a spherical one to avoid spherical aberration. reply satori99 9 hours agoparentIn this case, the spherical shape is an advantage.

    "originBody": "HOME WHAT WE DO RESOURCES NEWS, BLOG & EVENTS ABOUT US HOME WHAT WE DO RESOURCES NEWS, BLOG & EVENTS ABOUT US NEWS & BLOG MICROSOFT ERROR OR EXTERNAL ATTACK CAUSING DISRUPTION TO EMAIL COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE CLIMATE CHANGE COMMUNITY NEWS Publication date 27 Oct 2023 (in case you share a link to this page by email, please use this bit.ly link https://bit.ly/NewClimate_MicrosoftStatement to ensure delivery) UPDATE 28.10.2023: This issue is now partially resolved after being prioritised by Microsoft engineers. Only emails with PDF attachments containing the NewClimate URL continue to be blocked. Note this includes any report that references NewClimate (e.g. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report of Working Group 3, amongst many others). Since 17 October, to our knowledge any email with the NewClimate URL (newclimate dot org) in the email body, link, signature, reply header or contained anywhere in an attachment was unjustifiably quarantined by Microsoft email servers without any notice, regardless of who sends or receives the email. Since 28 October this issue has been partially resolved but persists for PDF attachments, and it is still unclear whether emails that have been lost throughout the climate community in the past weeks can be fully recovered. That our own email flow is disrupted is the least of our problems: all Microsoft tenants have been afflicted by the same issue when this URL appears in their emails, or any attachments they share, even when we are not a party to the communications. Hundreds of governmental and non-governmental organisations working on climate change appear to have been experiencing disruption to email communication when their communications contain any reference to the NewClimate URL. For example, as per our understanding: No organisation using Microsoft email services can currently send the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report of Working Group 3 as an attachment to anyone else (newclimate dot org URL appears 11 times in the report). The same applies to hundreds of other relevant scientific papers and reports from any organisations, where NewClimate URLs appear on the reference lists. Any multi-organisation email chain where any of the participants uses Microsoft email services have been breaking down in the case that NewClimate URLs are included. This could arise either because a NewClimate colleague is on the mailing list in the chat history, or if a NewClimate publication is linked to, in the email or the chat history. We understand that the majority of our partner organisations within the climate community use Microsoft email services, including the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It came as a surprise to us that this is even possible. It remains unclear whether this is the result of a targeted attack on Microsoft’s infrastructure against NewClimate, or simply a highly unfortunate error on the part of Microsoft. In our consultations with Microsoft and a number of independent IT experts, we have confirmed that we are not on any blacklist and our website is also free of malware. We are fully dependent on Microsoft to prioritise and solve the issue. Since the first publication of this statement, we understand that Microsoft engineers have now prioritised the issue and continue to work on resolving it. Beyond being an existential threat to our own organisation, we have been concerned that this issue could significantly disrupt communication within the climate community, at a time when it is most critical in the run up to COP28 in at the end of 2023 in Dubai. We are pleased that this situation is now being addressed and will update this page when we have further information. As per our understanding, emails lost in the past two weeks may not necessarily be recoverable, even after the cause of the issue has been resolved. The situation is extremely unfortunate and we apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause or may have caused. KEY CONTACTS MEET ALL EXPERTS PROF. DR.

If this was unintentional, it highlights the risk of depending on a few hugely centralized services. If it was intentional it really highlights the risk of depending on a few hugely centralized services. reply imoverclocked 12 hours agorootparentSure, but it hides the risks associated with the same kind of problem (assuming unintentional) in a highly distributed system. This is especially when the problem is distributed over many fiefdoms.Being able to call out a single giant entity on HN is much easier than trying to get the world to agree on fixing something. Source: we still use SMTP and we still have no common way to authenticate a sender without a centralized email system. (Yes, I know about SPF, DKIM, etc.) reply imoverclocked 14 hours agoparentprevYeah, it&#x27;s true that having all email in a few very large baskets is risky. However, running an email server is also not without risk and requires significant IT investment at any kind of reasonable scale. Keeping up with all of the auth mechanisms, spam, block lists, security vulnerabilities etc takes real focus. It&#x27;s not something an IT shop with a just single guy should take up...I think the real risk is relying on email at all anymore. The underlaying protocol dates back to the era of \"let&#x27;s see if we can get bits to move at all\" which predates any kind of \"how do we know what we are getting is authentic\" style of design. There are plenty of other avenues for communication that don&#x27;t succumb to the many inherent pitfalls of email. reply jjav 13 hours agorootparent> There are plenty of other avenues for communication that don&#x27;t succumb to the many inherent pitfalls of emailThe pitfall in this very article is the fact that communication was centralized on a giant near-monopoly which imposes it&#x27;s arbitrary rules on users by filtering whatever they want.So in that context, can you tell what these other avenues of communication are that don&#x27;t suffer from this exact same problem? I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re thinking of various 100% proprietary channels, all of which suffer from the problem of being centralized and users and content can get arbitrarily banned or blocked for no reason.At least with email you can simply stop using microsoft-hosted email and move elsewhere and your problems go away while still remaining email accessible to everyone. reply imoverclocked 13 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re thinking of various 100% proprietary channels, all of which suffer from the problem of being centralized and users and content can get arbitrarily banned or blocked for no reason.You are looking for an open+federated protocol. Those definitely exist.For example, an older one that I&#x27;m well aware has probably long-ago-peaked is XMPP. One can host their own XMPP domain and talk to other XMPP domains just like email can. It also has the ability to send content, presence, pub-sub notifications, offline messages (much like an email message) ... you name it. Storing contact lists and associations combined with the fact that messages come from authenticated sources by default means that spam is a lot harder to accomplish (or at least a lot easier to squash). All of this and XMPP is a 25 year-old protocol; This protocol can legally drink in the US. Just imagine what else exists today! :)However, the problem is not what technically exists. The problem is what is popular. Email is still extremely popular and ingrained in so many places. It&#x27;s easy to extend and put up a quick webpage that submits an email from some user-input. It&#x27;s easy to send notifications&#x2F;advertisements to. Attachment protocols have largely been sussed out. It&#x27;s even used quite commonly as a second form of authentication. You can expect most people to have an email address while a much smaller percentage of people expect to have any other single-form of electronic communication. reply jjav 7 hours agorootparent> You are looking for an open+federated protocol. Those definitely exist.Yes I am. Like you know, email.That&#x27;s why email is so awesome. I can easily spell out my email address to anyone in the world and they can now send me a message. We don&#x27;t have to share platforms or apps or OSs or providers or anything at all, other than access to a TCP&#x2F;IP pipe. And I will then receive that message. No company can interfere with that. reply imoverclocked 6 hours agorootparentYup, xmpp checks all of those boxes too.

Different tools for different needs and all that. reply johannes84 14 hours agorootparentprevI am honestly confused what big risks you believe to be connected to running your own email server, and what you think would be a significant IT investment?For context, I have been running a Debian mailserver (postfix + spamassassin + dovecot) with autoupdates - and occasional major version updates - for family and friends since 2007. Barring the occasional period of being preferentially delivered to the spam folder, I have not experienced any problems. My major benefit: I am sure that if a mail is sent to me, I will receive it.The system is running on one of the cheapest root servers from Hetzners used server market, and it also runs an odd set of other websites and VMs, so the IT investment is limited. I also consider the administration and update tasks as a form of continuing education in my profession. reply BrandoElFollito 14 hours agorootparentFor family and friends fine.When you have 30,000 users worldwide is it daunting. reply johannes84 14 hours agorootparentI agree! Therefore I’d suggest more people should host for family and friends :-) reply BrandoElFollito 30 minutes agorootparentIt depends what. I self host a lot of services for family and friends - but ony the ones I have complete control over.If there is a problem with something, I want to have a hope of fixing it (either someone already had the issue, or I can open an issue, or I can try try to fix the code&#x2F;configuration myself). These are great.Mail not so much. This can become a continuous struggle to get off blacklists, manage spam, troubleshoot deliveries, ... All these are not dependent on me and if I get into a blacklist or if Google stops to accept my mail I am cooked. This is the reason that after self-hosting email for a few years I got back to having it done by people whose job it is . reply imoverclocked 13 hours agorootparentprevExcept, family and friends isn&#x27;t the target here. It&#x27;s large-ish, professional organizations with a lot more surface area and visibility than your family email server.

I have seen more than one doctors office have an agreement that they want you to sign so that they can send one unencrypted email.

In one case where I had a definite false positive, opening a ticket with Microsoft resolved the issue within a few hours. Both myself and the entity with the false positive are government cloud customers, maybe our experience would be different in the commercial cloud.

We always have to get a japanese speaker to raise the case in that langauge because the JP support guys are way better than the english. reply MichaelZuo 14 hours agorootparentThe problem is that no decision maker at Microsoft is actually going to promise in writing that even 99.9999% of the email data will be retained, and does not somehow mysteriously vanish, no matter how much money you spend with them. Let alone an actual 100%.So it&#x27;s pointless to make such a claim that no one at Microsoft HQ even approximately believes. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also somewhere the C-level can point a finger (besides at himself) when something goes wrong. reply upofadown 14 hours agoparentprevIn general you should avoid doing your email through giant providers like Microsoft and Google.

Smaller providers are more interested in ensuring that everything is actually working. reply Avamander 13 hours agorootparentBoth approaches have their downsides.The small providers can get caught in the gears of large providers or even smaller providers using idiotic RBLs (sometimes a single one that causes a permanent reject). Nobody dares block Gmail or O365 however.But you won&#x27;t have an undiagnosable spam filter. Depends on your risks. reply UberFly 14 hours agorootparentprevSo true.

Of course, we could just pay Barracuda a verification fee and get the green light. They couldn&#x27;t even whitelist us themselves!

I’m sure it will be chocked up to “a misfiring spam filter” but after John Stewart’s unceremonious firing from Apple for his truth seeking content plans one begins to wonder. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agoparentTo be blunt, I don&#x27;t understand how people who work in technology, and who often see the result of bugs when dealing with an enormous amount of complexity, are so quick to jump to conspiracy theories when the \"misfiring spam filter\" is infinitely more probable.To emphasize, I think New Climate&#x27;s blog post does correctly highlight the fact that when \"the algorithms\" go haywire, it feels like it takes multiple acts of God to get a human to actually fix the issue. But I&#x27;m just tired of the lazy appeal to \"What The ELiTes DoN&#x27;t WanT You TO KnOw!!!\" whenever a bug pops up (and, ironically, who the \"elites\" are solely depends on what tribe you identify with - in this case, if you&#x27;re pro-CO2 reduction, the elites are evil corporate masters seeking more use of fossil fuels for their profits, and if you&#x27;re on the other side the elites want to use climate change as an excuse to stifle the economy and keep the peons in their place). reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentYeah I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a conspiracy. I think it&#x27;s a bug, or they are trying out some \"AI\" on their spam filter and it needs better training.But it also illustrates what could happen. Microsoft or Google could decide to silence email on certain topics, or they could conceivably be ordered to do so. Would they refuse? Doubtful. And they are so big and handle such a large percentage of email that it would have a real impact. reply happytiger 10 hours agorootparentThis is likely what is going on. But!Information control is becoming mainstreamed and it’s hilarious that people are so willing to assign to incompetence or error what has been clearly demonstrated to be systems of control and squelching of difficult opinions, especially from big tech.You see “big tech” (Microsoft, Google, etc.) has been responsible for so much crushing of “misinformation” lately I think it’s comical that people give the benefit of the doubt when these things happen.Shouldn’t we at least be mocking them for their hilariously dangerous errors and sometimes failures? Isn’t it honestly time to stop calling it a “conspiracy” like it’s not happening.I’ve run large scale DC operations. I know these things happen. But I seriously think it’s time we started questioning information control practices when they pop up like this — it’s not conspiracy when you have dozens of blatant examples.I had intended it as just a random thought because it struck me as funny. But seeing the backlash is anything but heartwarming and I really think people should seriously consider what could happen and is likely going to happen and defend against it happening.There is so much hostility to the idea that big tech would do this, when in fact they have been regularly doing it. Why in the world would you think this isn’t possible and how could anyone honestly assign “accidental” blackouts of organizations to conspiracy in 2023? reply LightHugger 13 hours agorootparentprevthe bad PR and people assuming the worse is the price the company pays for choosing to have no human support at all.

Now we know, after years of guessing, exactly what it cost. By David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. Oct 27, 2023, 11:56 AM CDT|19 Comments / 19 New Share this story Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge The US v. Google antitrust trial is about many things, but more than anything, it’s about the power of defaults. Even if it’s easy to switch browsers or platforms or search engines, the one that appears when you turn it on matters a lot. Google obviously agrees and has paid a staggering amount to make sure it is the default: testimony in the trial revealed that Google spent a total of $26.3 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones, and platforms. That number, the sum total of all of Google’s search distribution deals, came out during the Justice Department’s cross-examination of Google’s search head, Prabhakar Raghavan. It was made public after a debate earlier in the week between the two sides and Judge Amit Mehta over whether the figure should be redacted. Mehta has begun to push for more openness in the trial in general, and this was one of the most significant new pieces of information to be shared openly. Just to put that $26.3 billion in context: Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced in its recent earnings report that Google Search ad business brought in about $44 billion over the last three months and about $165 billion in the last year. Its entire ad business — which also includes YouTube ads — made a bit under $90 billion in profit. This is all back-of-the-napkin math, but essentially, Google is giving up about 16 percent of its search revenue and about 29 percent of its profit to those distribution deals. Google is giving up about 16 percent of its search revenue and about 29 percent of its profit to those distribution deals Most of that money, of course, goes to Apple. The New York Times recently reported that Google’s deal to be the default search engine in Safari across Google products cost the company about $18 billion in 2021. (Apple’s outsize percentage of the total is why that particular deal has been such a focus of the first weeks of the trial.) In addition, Google pays Mozilla for default placement in Firefox; it pays Samsung for the same on its devices; and it has deals with many device makers, wireless carriers, and other platforms to be the default as well. Until now, these numbers have been closely held secrets, leaving competitors and analysts to speculate about exactly what it’s worth to Google to be the near-universal default choice. The information also comes as Google is beginning its defense portion of the trial, which started with Raghavan testifying that Google is at perpetual risk of losing its cool — and its users — to platforms like TikTok and ChatGPT. Raghavan said that some users call his search engine “Grandpa Google.” (Raghavan has been saying stuff like this for a while now.) He also said that he sees Yelp and Amazon as competitors and that, in such a hot market, Google has to do everything it can to stay relevant and compete. The Justice Department, on the other hand, is making the case that spending $26.3 billion on securing default status everywhere is actually a way to make sure the market isn’t competitive. After a few more weeks of testimony, Mehta will have to decide who’s right. 19 COMMENTS19 NEW Most Popular Elon Musk gives X employees one year to replace your bank Hertz is scaling back its EV ambitions because its Teslas keep getting damaged Ford hits the brakes on $12 billion in EV spending because EVs are too expensive Sam Bankman-Fried is going to talk himself right into jail The tragically millennial vocabulary of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Google will probably lose some market share. This means less revenue. However, the \"cost of revenue\" is lower as well. So it may just be a wash. When tobacco companies were banned from advertising, their big expense of advertising went down as well - and so profit rose. Google&#x27;s long-term outlook looks murkier. It really is possible for new entrants to come in and steal market-share if they didn&#x27;t have to pay for default-privilege. Platforms could encourage specialized search engines as well - pick one for shopping, another for maps, another for reviews - maybe we&#x27;ll get a Cambrian explosion?But the fact that no ad-support search engine has been able to beat Google all these years, even Microsoft-supported Bing - means that internet search is fundamentally a hard problem to solve. It&#x27;s also relatively capital intensive - all the hardware to crawl and index the web, human SERP raters and content moderators.As the internet becomes more and more hyper-commercialized, the value of a general purpose search-engine may decline. Why search when there&#x27;s mostly garbage out there. Try going to any news website. reply soup10 14 hours agoparentNo, most people will use whatever the default is. The vast majority of search is for a few popular queries: facebook.com, wikipedia article, current event, celebrity, product etc. This isn&#x27;t the 90s anymore where search engines were terrible and google was a big step up. Even among power users, the difference is not that clear. reply hughw 14 hours agorootparentIs that true for Bing? Do most Windows users the default Edge and leave default search on Bing? reply bobthepanda 14 hours agorootparentGoogle spends a lot of money on ads to get you off edge, and users are pretty much conditioned to ignore MS defaults.Before Chrome existed it was pretty common for people to suggest downloading FF out of hand. So the habit has existed for years, on top of the ad campaigns that Google runs for chrome. reply ylere 15 hours agoprevThere were 4.9b internet users in 2021 [0]. Assuming a search market share of 90%, that&#x27;s $5.9 per user and year - which seems a lot of considering it includes the developing world, but then of course Google&#x27;s total ad revenue in 2021 was $209b ($47.3&#x2F;user&#x2F;yr) [1] globally and $61.2b in the US alone ($198.6&#x2F;user&#x2F;yr!!!) [0,2].No other player has the ad revenue and market power to even attempt competing with Google:* Microsoft&#x27;s search ads + LinkedIn revenue was only $18.7b [3] in 2021 (9% of Googles) and they are the only big global (i.e. not Chinese) player with ad revenues over $10b and a competing search engine.* Meta is the only company that comes closer in terms of ad revenue at $112b in 2021 (53% of Google) [4], but it&#x27;s hard to imagine how they would fit search into their ecosystem.* Apple has the resources and controls the valuable (=mostly iOS users) Safari market, but even for them, they would have to forego $18b&#x2F;year (as per the article) in pure profits from their deal with Google and manage to actually create a competing product and advertise it heavily, which would costs them 10s of billions a year more. It makes sense that they&#x27;d rather keep taking the cash instead.This also makes you realize just how valuable dominating the browser market with Google Chrome and having significant influence on the mobile market with Android must be for Google (and also why Apple doesn&#x27;t allow third party browser engines on their platform).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itu.int&#x2F;itu-d&#x2F;reports&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;facts-figures-2...

In the west, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s about correct, but not in China. Baidu takes a big chunk of that and China has a large population. Unless a really small fraction of China uses search engines, I don&#x27;t see how Google can be at 90% globally.Edit: Apparently 840 million Chinese use search engines[0] and at least 70% use Baidu[1] which would be 588 million so something like 12% out of those 4.9 billion people.

This is just an excellent example of an \"exception.\"In the case of Google, they already have decades of conditioning with people viewing it as the main or only search engine worth anything.

Search engines are something most people know at least something about by now. reply jader201 14 hours agoparentprevI’d argue these are very different, for at least two reasons:1. This is comparing desktops&#x2F;laptops to phones. Way more people have phones than computers, and most people that have phones and not computers probably don’t realize or know how they can change the default.2. This is comparing a browser to a search engine. More people are going to notice they’re using a different browser vs. using a different search engine.Obviously this is speculation, but it seems like pretty reasonable speculation, particularly the first point. reply pr337h4m 13 hours agorootparent>More people are going to notice they’re using a different browser vs. using a different search engine.Chromium Edge and Chrome have pretty much identical UI&#x2F;UX.

And even if they notice the difference, I&#x27;m not sure that a) they&#x27;d care, or b) they&#x27;d know how to do anything about it.My wife&#x2F;mom would probably ask me how to change their browser back, if the UX is different enough that they couldn&#x27;t find their way around (but if not, then they won&#x27;t care about that either).But they&#x27;re not going to care to change the default browser back, as the UX difference between the two has a much smaller gap. Only the results are different, if they may not even notice that.> About 20% of users changing the default browser is a big deal, especially when all browsers are identical (WebKit) under the hood.But this means that 80% users stick to the default (in this specific case). If these are users that don&#x27;t care or don&#x27;t know how to change the default, then the defaults matter more than the OP (and the linked article) suggest.

Paying for positioning happens in many, many places. Would we not also need to outlaw sponsorships and exclusivity deals such as \"$BRAND_NAME - the official beer of $SPORTS_ARENA\"?

Those restrictions have to be defined in a clear, unambiguous way to avoid challenges in court.I&#x27;m saying there&#x27;s probably no version of your hypothetical law that would stand up in court (not to mention pass a legislature).To your point of consumer harm, businesses have rights (varying by the law of the land) that must be balanced against consumer rights. reply ianbutler 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m being a little more devil&#x27;s advocate here and playing fast with some of the practical realities than I might personally hold as an actual opinion so keep that in mind, but:A business should always be subservient to the general citizens who will make up said business. Following that, consumer rights (citizen rights) should always be promoted over the rights of a business. So I don&#x27;t know that I take your point about balancing those two things. They seem like separate classes of rights with one that is more important. I guess that&#x27;s technically still balancing, but in a way that business always loses.As to writing a law to stand up to scrutiny. I don&#x27;t know that I have to care about that. That&#x27;s not my problem to deal with, that&#x27;s our legislators problem. In fact that should be one of their primary problems, writing laws that stand up to scrutiny that protect abuse of general citizens.It seems more like a lack of will, which I could speculate on.Edit: I&#x27;ll say this, as something reflecting my actual opinion. I tend to agree that this has a high degree of complexity and applying a flippant indiscriminate legislation to ban this won&#x27;t work and won&#x27;t stand up to legal scrutiny, though I get the sense you know a lot more about why than I do. That said, I do think we can do better, and if you work backwards from an impossibly high ideal, with a lot of time and effort someone can land on a solution that&#x27;s better than nothing. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s impossible. I don&#x27;t think legislation is necessarily the right way to go about it. I was hesitant to add that part to my initial post but went with it anyway.

In practice, it&#x27;s just a group of humans. So any time you assume you are putting the rights of citizens ahead of businesses, you are putting the rights of one set of humans over another set.It&#x27;s never simple. It&#x27;s really hard (&#x2F;impossible) to come up with good legislation. Much of it creates weird incentives or high costs to enforce or high costs to doing business which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices and citizens in the form of lower dividend checks in retirement.Saying \"it&#x27;s not my problem\" amounts to \"i have no idea how to solve this\". reply ianbutler 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right I have no idea how to solve this very large problem in society, I&#x27;m flattered that you expected me to.

These stories of epiphanies dont apply to youI respect people that apply themselves reply saeranv 10 hours agoprevI disagree with other commentators here arguing that there&#x27;s no benefit this monitor would bring over simply reducing screen brightness. But I also think the claim made by the article here is at best, miscommunicated: that the bounced light improves the monitor light quality itself. On this point, I think the criticism from HN is correct, there wouldn&#x27;t be a meaningful difference between equivalent bounced light, and light from the monitor. There might be a possible benefit from the lack of light flickering from AC-driven electric lights, but that is only true if the space is daylit.However, I think there is a quantifiable benefit from making the monitor light directly dependent on environmental light, which forces our perception to adjust to a more, low contrast, diffuse environmental context.Part of the problem is that \"brightness\" in the context of monitors is different from how \"brightness\" is used in science of light, where it is defined as the subjective perception of light that changes relative to differences in light levels[1]. So you can see your way to the washroom in the middle of the night with no lights, but can&#x27;t see your way back after you turned on the washroom light, because your subjective perception of light (brightness) has changed, even though objectively the amount of visible light (illuminance) has not changed.Therefore, having a screen lit by the environment, would shift your perception of light to better see duller, low-light conditions, which is better for our eyes, since more uniform, diffuse light causes less strain than strong, directed light.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brightness[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Luminous_efficiency_function reply jolmg 8 hours agoparent> There might be a possible benefit from the lack of light flickering from AC-driven electric lights, but that is only true if the space is daylit.The change isn&#x27;t from AC-driven lighting to non-AC-driven lighting.

I mostly associate Reflective LCD screens with Gameboys.Remember how helpful it was to go outside to see the Gameboy screen? There was a reflective material on the back side of the screen, which \"lit\" up the screen. As an aside, there was even a cool Gameboy Advance game with a solar sensor that encouraged the player to go outside to charge up the protagonist&#x27;s \"solar gun\": https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boktai:_The_Sun_Is_in_Your_Han.... Even the GBA SP, which had a light you could turn on and off, lit the screen up from the front.I&#x27;m definitely not an expert in the area. My impression is that after the Gameboy, there wasn&#x27;t much demand for these types of screen. I also suspect something about them doesn&#x27;t scale to larger sizes as cost effectively as other screens, and there&#x27;s been little interest from corporations in improving the technology :( reply layer8 13 hours agoparentReflective LCD monitors exist: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sunvisiondisplay.com&#x2F; However, resolution is relatively low (FHD at 32”), contrast is quite low (25:1), as is color gamut (15% of NTSC).

All this project does is replace the backlight with either a reflective backlight, or ambient light if it&#x27;s bright enough.So how could this be any improvement beyond just turning down the brightness on a plain old LCD screen? reply hex4def6 16 hours agoparentThere is no improvement. There are a lot of negatives though. For starters:* transmissivity of an LCD panel is pretty bad (10%-25% transmissivity?). So this is always going to be extremely dim, unless you stick a really bright lamp right up close to it. Thus, this isn&#x27;t \"matching\" ambient light in any way.* Brightness uniformity is going to be terrible unless you use a photography softbox lamp.* Color accuracy is going to be terrible. Monitors use LEDs that are extremely cold &#x2F; blue (~6500K if I remember) to get good color reproduction over the entire range of possible colors. Unless you want your house to look like an operating room you probably won&#x27;t use a lamp that comes close to reproducing that.This is a solved problem in cellphones. Put a $0.25 ALS in the front bezel, enable DDC&#x2F;CI, and call it a day.Here&#x27;s a product idea that actually solves the issue: make a little USB dongle that has an ALS in it, make it in a formfactor that allows you to clip it to the top of any monitor, and use that to control the brightness. For DDC&#x2F;CI monitors, you can directly control the backlight, and for other monitors you can just fake it by reducing the brightness of the image. reply nomel 12 hours agorootparentI actually did this exact thing, 20 years ago, with a monitor that had a dead backlight. I took it apart and tried angling a mirror with a diffuser on it (similar to what&#x27;s shown), but ended up using white paper on the back, and a light&#x2F;window behind, normal backlight style.Why? Because, all your points are correct (although the lack of uniformity was pretty ok&#x2F;analog). And, as the images in the article show, you can&#x27;t get reasonable brightness without a high powered light behind it. Oddly enough, the images in the article, with the light above and a poor angled reflector in the back, show maximum possible blinding glare, with the bulb shining right in your face.It was temporary, fairly terrible, experience.

Most color specifications including Rec. 709 (basically sRGB) specify this color temperature through the D65 white point [1], so to display colors reliably close to spec you actually need this specific temperature&#x2F;spectrum.It’s certainly cooler than most indoor lighting, but 6500K bulbs in stores are as common as warmer ones (IME). Variable-temperature bulbs work well enough to output it too, and I would actually recommend using them to get a good matching daylight white when indoors during midday, while still being able to have warmer colors in the evening or at night (just as night color modes do for your monitor).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Illuminant_D65 reply SomeRndName11 10 hours agorootparentprevColor temperature of the backlight LEDs have nothing to do with width of the gamut of the monitor.

Two of the wires in HDMI are literally just an I2C bus.You can control things like brightness, switch inputs, turn the screen on&#x2F;off, etc.Unfortunately it&#x27;s ancient, incredibly badly documented, and rarely implemented well by monitors.A previous Dell monitor I had flickered terribly when you change the brightness (it did work though).My current very expensive LG monitor has a bug with input switching. It clearly is meant to work because when you tell it to switch inputs it blanks the screen but then just returns to the same input.I was intended to use that with a USB KVM switch so I didn&#x27;t have to get a very expensive HDMI KVM switch. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work... so I got a HDMI KVM switch.Unfortunately the switch I got ignores DDC&#x2F;CI brightness commands so now my hardware brightness knob doesn&#x27;t work. You can&#x27;t win. :-(Current plan is to implement a MitM DDC&#x2F;CI device that inserts sneaky commands. Unfortunately DDC&#x2F;CI is also the channel used for HDCP. It sends a message every two seconds and there&#x27;s a required response latency, which means it&#x27;s a bit tricky to avoid interfering with it. reply NoImmatureAdHom 11 hours agorootparentprevALS: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease)DDC: Detroit Diesel CorporationCI: Confidence interval reply lupire 14 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like in China, but in USA this would be a \"college application project\" to get him into Harvard and then close down the nonstarter company. reply fooker 4 hours agorootparentThis will get him into an Ivy league or equivalent university pretty easily. reply neogodless 17 hours agoparentprevI think it would make sense if screens detected ambient light and adjusted brightness to match (like smart phones do....) so this is just a clever way to do just that with low tech.

Certainly not me.A much better screen, in my opinion, would have super high contrast with low brightness. Yet, this isn&#x27;t something that gets measured by reviewers.

The monitor I bought last year for $400 tops out at 400 nits.Laptops, phones, and smart watches are designed to be used in varying conditions like outdoors, where the sun can easily overpower a 400 nit monitor. Also in low light conditions, which is why they mostly have ambient light sensors.There&#x27;s always some user out there who wants to watch HDR videos in the middle of the Sahara desert at solar noon, which would actually be an interesting use case for the monitor in the article. reply post_break 17 hours agoparentprevWhat?

When a car has multiple trim levels, and one has more horsepower, you would want the one with fewer? Because in theory you wouldn’t use it? And this has nothing to do with MPG either because in some cars the higher power engines get better fuel economy. But based on that metric alone, you would pick the lesser model?

I argue we should rely less on rarely practical characteristics (maximum power &#x2F; brigthness) and add more day-to-day aspects into reviews and search filters.There are few qualities usually mentioned along side displays: size, technology, resolution, colour rating, contrast ratio, and max brightness. I think brightness matters less past some point and we really should focus more on traits listed by @boplicity and @dijit (there&#x27;s got to be more).Similarly with cars: I don&#x27;t care about top speed as long as it goes upto the motorway limit, I don&#x27;t care about engine power as long as car feels nice in real life; I pay attention to size (will it be comfortable in the city and in my tight parking lot?), fuel consumption, interior quality, luggage space, steering sensations.> Just like if a MacBook Pro came in either 1600nits or 400nits, you’d pick 400?Well, if the 400 nits one has an advantage (for example it has OLED, so only the letters will burn my eyes in the evenings, not the whole area of the screen) then I would pick that one. reply adfgiopjionio 11 hours agoparentprevA bright panel can be turned down. reply SomeRndName11 10 hours agorootparentNot below their factory defined minimum.

One of the things that I noticed was that without the backlight panel, you could light up the screen using ambient light and use a camera to get infrared light to reflect your fingertips for detection. A bunch of folks in the NUI space were doing this. Projectors, LCDs, front detection, back detection, capacitive touches, optical touches, etc.The biggest issue with this approach is color balance. Imperfect light creates imperfect colors. The LCD is tuned to display colors at the light intensity of the backlight panel it uses. Without the backlight and filters, light is uneven, unbalanced, and it will show in the screen. Fine if you’re just doing text. Not fine if you’re editing video.

Some may be sensitive to polarisation, some people are sensitive to how grainy is antiglare coating is etc.A good number of people (me including) cannot tolerate backlight with blue at 450 nm, the more it is towards green the better. Some cannot tolerate KSF phosphor in the wide gamut backlights (I am perfetcly fine with it), and love quantum dots.It is a serious problem, but using the ambient light for the backlight would make experimenting the backlight a super easy task, so yeah, this monitor is a great idea. reply esperent 9 hours agoparent> A good number of people (me including) cannot tolerate backlight with blue at 450 nm, the more it is towards green the better.How do you go about figuring out something like that? reply LouisSayers 11 hours agoprevI always have brightness on as low as possible and have noticed people in the office often have theirs up quite a lot.Never suffered from dry eyes, at 36 still have 20&#x2F;20 vision, and haven&#x27;t felt a need to do anything about my monitors.The biggest issue I&#x27;ve faced is actually environmental glare (light from windows &#x2F; bouncing off walls) - but nothing some curtains couldn&#x27;t fix. reply winrid 13 hours agoprevSwitching from OLED to IPS screens that have no flicker helps a lot too.Very hard to find an OLED monitor that doesn&#x27;t have flicker (this is not refresh rate - this is brightness modulating from 0 - 100% hundreds of times a second - hard on eye muscles).

RON AMADEO - 10/27/2023, 2:11 PM Aurich Lawson 59 WITH Android 14 has a nasty storage bug that seems to be affecting users of the \"multiple profiles\" feature. The bug is about as bad as you can get, with users having \"unusable\" devices due to getting locked out of device storage. A few users are likening the experience to getting hit with \"ransomware.\" Earlier reports had this bug limited to the Pixel 6, but Google seemed to ignore those reports, and now with a wider rollout, this does not seem device-specific. Everything upgrading to Android 14 this early seems to be affected: Pixel 6, 6a, 7, 7a, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet.

You can unsubscribe at any time. The Google issue tracker for this is now up to over 350 replies and has had no response from Google. The bug is languishing at only the medium \"P2\" priority (P0 is the highest) and remains \"unassigned,\" meaning, assuming the tracker is up to date, no one is looking into it. Some users have helpfully posted log files full of worrying messages, like, \"Failed to open directory /data/media/0: Structure needs cleaning.\" Being locked out of your own device's data partition causes all sorts of bizarre issues. Some users are boot looping, others are stuck on a \"Pixel is starting...\" message, while others can get into the phone. If your phone tries to continue trucking with no local storage, you'll be inundated with all sorts of error messages. The camera app claims to be \"out of storage,\" and you can't take screenshots because there's nowhere to store the screenshots. The file manager lists 0 bytes for every type of file and empty folder, and the files also aren't viewable from a PC over USB. The System UI and Settings also keep crashing. Basically, computers need storage to function! Android's user-profile system allows for both multiple users on a single device (which is good for tablets) and splitting up \"home\" and \"work\" profiles to keep your work data separate from your personal data, via duplicate apps. It sounds like the bug is only hitting users who take advantage of this rarely used feature, with lots of reports that the primary profile—that's usually the important one—gets locked out. Advertisement Several users are complaining about the data lost from all of this, so it's a good time to remind people to always have a backup of everything on their phones. Even straight out of the box, Android has options for Google Photos automatic backups, Play Games storage of your game data, and a million other cloud-based data features (it would be nice if Android phones had a comprehensive whole-phone backup feature, though). While it is totally reasonable to expect your OS to keep running after an update, phones are uniquely vulnerable to getting lost/stolen/damaged, so having everything get stored somewhere else is a great idea. Shockingly, several users report the phone is automatically doing a factory reset, which deletes all your data, shutting down any possibility of data recovery. This feature should probably not exist, but it's another sign that phones are not a reliable storage medium for critical data. What's so strange about how Google is handling this bug is that the company has tools to deal with this. Google delivers software on a slow and often frustrating \"roll out\" strategy, where a small percentage of users will get an update at first, and as the days pass, more and more users opt in to the update. Google does this to see if any problems pop up via its extensive Android analytics system, and if a problem is detected, the update rollout can be halted, limiting the problem to as few people as possible. Why didn't that happen here? Surely, a bug where people are locked out of their phones and possibly lose data is worth halting a rollout, but it never happened. Google's entire response to this problem has been lacking. To our knowledge, no one from Google has officially addressed the issue in the 10-ish days it has been around. It hasn't issued statements to the several sites that have already reported on this. No one is replying to the bug tracker, and the issue is unassigned. What's up, Google?

But here&#x27;s what I was able to do: From the fastboot menu (using the power + vol down button to boot the phone) select \"Recovery mode\" then when the phone goes to the No Command screen, hold the power button for 1 second then press the vol up button and release both at the same time. This will give you a command prompt of sorts. Go to factory wipe&#x2F;reset and vioala. You can reload your phone.

Isn&#x27;t all your data gone? reply jacquesm 11 hours agoparentprevFactory wipe&#x2F;reset followed by &#x27;Reload&#x27; sounds like you end up losing all of your data if it wasn&#x27;t backed up elsewhere. Usually the value of the data outweighs the value of the device, especially with phones that are harder to backup than they should be. reply PeterisP 10 hours agorootparent> especially with phones that are harder to backup than they should be.That&#x27;s interesting, my experience with a physically destroyed Android is that I didn&#x27;t lose any data without any backups other than the default settings, since apparently all the apps that I use sync to cloud by default, without me needing to configure any backups, and use local storage only for caching, so all the apps, settings and data could be automagically restored. reply mook 7 hours agorootparentMy fear is that your phone is also the primary MFA device, so losing that could mean you can&#x27;t log into your account anymore (and therefore can&#x27;t restore the cloud backup)… reply ISL 6 hours agorootparentGoogle offers to back up Authenticator, should you choose to do so. reply mook 3 hours agorootparentSorry, I should be clearer: to login to Google on a new device, you typically need to accept a prompt on an old device. But if your old device is dead, that&#x27;s not possible. Authenticator does TOTP and things, which is typically not adequate for logging in (even though it _should_ be). reply pmontra 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not using Google Authenticator or anything like that but when my old phone dropped somewhere at the bottom of a river all my banking apps, which do 2FA, had a way to let me start again on my new phone. Services that don&#x27;t assist their users in a disaster recover scenario are severely lacking. reply utybo 2 hours agorootparentprevThe prompt on an old device is just one of the MFA options you can use. You can also use a security key (e.g. Yubikey, Solokey, etc.). reply zigzag312 3 hours agorootparentprevWhich defeats the purpose of MFA, since your Google account becomes your only factor. reply sirius87 4 hours agorootparentprevThis was my worst fear but I had opted-in to backup Authenticator with Google. Opting in to backup your data with Google is seamless and it also restores stuff like SMS messages.But I suppose this is one more thing the anti-trust case against Google should probably be looking into. Should Google be allowed this deep integration with their cloud services? reply autoexec 8 hours agorootparentprevHanding your data over to Google&#x27;s cloud is the sanctioned option, but I prefer an SD card and local backups to another device. reply mksybr 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, I believe that is the case that you lose all the data. reply V__ 12 hours agoparentprevLocking down phones so much was really a mistake.

P1, btw. Most manufacturers now just revert some commits (and they identified them in a month!), and some BLE manufacturers pushed firmware updates - after 6 months of broken equipment.Those two stories is all what you need to know about \"7 years of updates are important\". reply sirius87 5 hours agoprevI faced this issue last week. I use the other user profile for Android app development. My phone was lying on the table before me as I watched it abruptly reboot to a familiar black screen that prompted me to Try to restart or Factory reset the phone (losing all data). Obviously, fearing data loss, I chose to gamble with restart, not knowing what the issue was.Then the phone began bootlooping with the Google logo and a progress bar stuck, going back to black and repeating. The power button + vol down move to get into fastboot was really really hard to get into. It took several attempts and about 15mins of time to finally get to the Factory reset option again. I lost all my data.As an occasional android app dev who mainly writes apps for personal use, the thought of reporting the bug to Google didn&#x27;t even cross my mind because (a) it seemed like a random filesystem corruption (b) I&#x27;m pretty much used to Google ignoring even high quality bugs reports from Android devs with helpful logs, so an end-user bug report with no logs would be beyond hope.This may be a case of grass is greener, but Samsung in recent years has been responsive to bug fixes and updates while with Pixel&#x27;s you basically get what comes through Android updates. Either way, as an Android user, bugs are a way of life.I have another 3 year old device on Android 11 no longer eligible for updates with a similar 2 user profile setup, and that also randomly reboots to the Try to restart&#x2F;Factory reset prompt usually after I hit the power button and the lock screen goes wonky. Just that restarting fortunately works in that case without any data loss. reply skar3 35 minutes agoprevIt also happened to me with a company phone purchased specifically for the multiple profile experience, we chose a Pixel to avoid having unrequired customization on features as happens on Samsungs. We performed the setup with Android 13, one day after the update the device became a brick reply btreecat 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;m currently impacted by this bug. My grandfather just passed away and the family has been trading pictures in group messages. I&#x27;ve nowost access to my copies of those images.Yes, it&#x27;s my fault I hadn&#x27;t backed up yet. However it&#x27;s not like _i did something_ to invite this, like jump in a pool with my phone or lose it out a car window.I&#x27;m typing this message on this phone, and I&#x27;m hoping a fix comes, because I really don&#x27;t want to lose those photos. reply onion2k 2 hours agoparentIf they&#x27;re in group messages all the other parties will have copies. You can ask them to send them again. reply kogepathic 5 hours agoprev> it would be nice if Android phones had a comprehensive whole-phone backup feature, thoughThere is, or I should say, was a way to do this: adb backupUnfortunately, for \"security\" reasons, nearly every app developer (Google included) opts out of it in the app manifest, completely nerfing the feature. [1]We live in a truly terrible timeline where the infrastructure to do what the author describes exists and has been there for years, and yet has been made functionally useless by user-hostile policy choices.Google&#x27;s incentives are also opposed to allowing users to take an offline backup of their apps and app data, because now they&#x27;re able to sell more cloud storage for your data.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;74387730&#x2F;back-up-android... reply jacquesm 11 hours agoprevI have said this before and I&#x27;ll keep saying it until it changes: updates suck for &#x27;regular&#x27; users, it&#x27;s like a grenade with five pins, one of which will give you a working machine with some improvements and the other four will result in data loss, loss of critical functionality that you relied upon, more advertising and security issues. It&#x27;s a total crap shoot and manufacturers should realize that with every botched update user trust in the computing industry is further eroded (assuming that is still possible). reply gruez 10 hours agoparent>it&#x27;s like a grenade with five pinsIsn&#x27;t the better analogy \"a revolver with 6 chambers\"?

That said, the entire handling of backing up &#x2F; migrating all data could be MUCH better: I migrated from Pixel 6 to Pixel 8, photos were fine, but for everything else it was badly designed: it did a partial transfer of a handful of file types, leaving a range of documents&#x2F;PDFs etc unmigrated (in the region of 2Gb of files). Subsequently I was able to copy content across using the copy to nearby device, but that recopied the already transferred files plus it screwed up the file creation dates. So then I had a long tedious de-dup stage to clear things up but at least I have everything across now.Not the sort of experience you expect (but maybe I should!) reply nmstoker 2 hours agoparentOne more point: I&#x27;m sure this was better on previous Pixel to Pixel transfers.I&#x27;m definitely noticing a number of regressions across the new OS. Central functions that worked fine getting stuttery,eg showing a PDF, although it has cleared up after a couple of weeks, it was 100% fine for years on the old Pixel 6 under Android 13. reply josephcsible 12 hours agoprevIf not for locked bootloaders, it would be trivial for everyone to recover all of the data that this bug is affecting. reply gruez 10 hours agoparentLocked boot loaders are there for a reason though. Otherwise anyone with 2 minutes of physical access to your device can permanently compromise it. reply NelsonMinar 8 hours agorootparentSo which is the bigger practical risk in 2023? A person physically taking your phone and compromising it? Or a software update making your phone unusable and possibly suffer catastrophic data loss? reply gruez 7 hours agorootparentYes. Note that the person in question doesn&#x27;t have to be a random mugger on the street. It could be a suspicious spouse, nosey coworker, or a voyeuristic phone technician. reply altfredd 4 hours agorootparentWhat \"suspicious spouse\"? If someone has personal computer and can sift data off phone via something like usb connection, they are probably either state level adversary or professional black hat.At this point you may as well give up, because those people have access to (years old) 0-day exploits, which work flawlessly regardless of \"security measures\" used by phone manufacturer. reply fomine3 1 hour agorootparentNo exploit is needed if bootloader is unlocked. Just install malware from bootloader. reply yjftsjthsd-h 9 hours agorootparentprevIf the bootloader is unlocked, it&#x27;s only permanent until you reflash it.Also, there are options between \"user has no control\" and \"totally unsecured bootloader\" (ex. user-provided keys) reply gruez 7 hours agorootparent>If the bootloader is unlocked, it&#x27;s only permanent until you reflash it.That&#x27;s very vendor specific. Of the android phones I&#x27;ve owned none of them exhibited that behavior. You could flash and reflash without re-unlocking. It only gets locked if you issue an explicit lock command.>Also, there are options between \"user has no control\" and \"totally unsecured bootloader\" (ex. user-provided keys)There are good reasons to have unlockable boot loaders, but this case specifically (ie. data loss from when your phone bootloops) isn&#x27;t one of them. For one, do you really expect the average user to generate their own keys, reconfigure their bootloaders, and resign their roms? Even if they could pull it off that effort would surely be better spent setting up an actual backup solution, which would protect against other hazards that an unlocked boot loader would not (eg. phone falling into the ocean). reply yjftsjthsd-h 5 hours agorootparent> You could flash and reflash without re-unlocking. It only gets locked if you issue an explicit lock command.Slight miscommunication; I was intending to address the specific security threat of \"attacker has (temporary) physical access and flashes something malicious onto the phone&#x27;s root filesystem (anything from a complete ROM to a kernel module or background process that autostarts and runs as root every boot)\", in which case the user can just re-flash the phone&#x27;s non-encrypted partitions from known-good images and be on their merry way.> do you really expect the average user to generate their own keys, reconfigure their bootloaders, and resign their romsFair; it&#x27;s unlikely for most users. replybloopernova 13 hours agoprevIf factory resets are indeed happening, maybe it&#x27;s the device management service thinking it got a remote wipe request?(Pixel 8 Pro owner, full disclosure and all that guff) reply jeroenhd 9 hours agoparentSince this only seems to be hitting people with multiple profiles, I bet it&#x27;s the user profile system running into either permission issues or file structure issues. reply ColoursofOSINT 6 hours agoprevGood things is that GrapheneOS (seemingly) caught this early and fixed it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.social&#x2F;@GrapheneOS&#x2F;111309676504712576 reply codethief 27 minutes agoparentThank god, this is the piece of info I was looking for here in this thread. reply xaerise 13 hours agoprevInteresting that Google is keeping their mouth shut....I think someone is getting a lawsuit and another one is getting a box for their stuff... reply curiousgal 11 hours agoparentSo glad I moved off buying Google phones after the shit show the Pixel 6 has been. reply blibble 11 hours agorootparentI was one of those who queued up to buy the original Android phone (HTC Dream), and was happy to support an open source and open phone OSI switched from Pixel&#x2F;Android to Apple last yearGoogle break basic functionality constantly (phone calls, camera), and the device is simply not able to be relied uponyet these work fine on a $50 feature phoneit&#x27;s like using Windows 95 again reply scohesc 12 hours agoprevAbsolutely amazing how Google can release these updates for devices that _they make and support themselves_ without first running tests on the operating system and making sure these things don&#x27;t happen.Yes, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s hard to track down bugs and this is likely one of them - but the fact that people are trying to get Google&#x27;s attention because their phones are soft-bricking and Google continues to do nothing about it says volumes about how much they care about their customers.I ran into a problem with the Pixel 5 I was running at the time. Woke up in the morning and the phone was off. Wouldn&#x27;t boot. Wouldn&#x27;t respond to anything at all. Thousands of people were having the same issue all within the span of a few months - Google Bug was created, nothing was done for 3-4 weeks while hundreds of users added their input on the bug... then the issue was suddenly closed with \"won&#x27;t fix\" with no explanation.I know the law is toothless against these massive corporations because the governments been bought out for decades at this point, but I&#x27;d sure love to see a company like Google&#x2F;Alphabet shattered into tens of different companies.

Quite a few of the security isolations&#x2F;sandboxing have lead to some of the more basic usability bugs.My dad hit one a few days ago, complained he couldn&#x27;t restart his phone. I proceeded to watch him hold down the volume and power button to get the prompt to shutdown&#x2F;reboot. Upon clicking, it did nothing. So I tried it then, still nothing. Realized at this point that the device had lockscreen locked. After unlocking the screen and repeating this it rebooted fine. (My first gut reaction was &#x27;can&#x27;t you just hold power button to get the reboot screen?&#x27;, but nope that pops up some google assistant crap instead, so now he has to juggle not having it screenshot each time he needs to shut it off or restart it) reply lawgimenez 10 hours agoparentMy parents, me and my wife’s side just completely moved away from Android because of random issues that old people are unable to figure it out.

All backups help against accidental destruction and incidents like in this article, but for ransomware protection most cloud storage solutions won&#x27;t help you, you need either offline or append-only backups. reply serf 10 hours agorootparentprevfrom a data loss perspective, sure.from an extortion perspective i&#x27;d rather have my data wiped. reply dirtyhippiefree 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can pay extortionists to get your data back.If your phone automatically factory resets, all the money in the world won’t recover your data…sadly worse than ransomware… reply blibble 12 hours agoparentprevat least the randomware people have someone you can contact reply ColoursofOSINT 6 hours agoparentprevI would rather have ransomware. At least paying would give you a chance to get the data back. reply cafeinux 12 hours agoparentprev [–] Well, NotPetya was a ransomware, yet paying wouldn&#x27;t have decrypted any data. reply PeterisP 10 hours agorootparentWell, NotPetya obviously was not ransomware, it was malware that masqueraded to pretend to be ransomware. reply GTP 12 hours agorootparentprev [–] It was actually a wiper. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
