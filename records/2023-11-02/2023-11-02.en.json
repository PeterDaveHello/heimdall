    "originBody": "Oct 31st, 2023 @ justine's web page Cosmopolitan Third Edition Cosmopolitan Honeybadger After nearly one year of development, I'm pleased to announce our version 3.0.1 release of the Cosmopolitan library. The project is an entirely new animal. For starters, Mozilla sponsored our work as part of their MIECO program. Google also awarded me an open source peer bonus for my work on Cosmopolitan, which is a rare honor, and it's nice to see our project listed up there among the greats, e.g. curl, linux, etc. In terms of this release, we're living up to the great expectations you've all held for this project in a number of ways. The first is we invented a new linker that lets you build fat binaries which can run on these platforms: AMD64 Linux MacOS Windows FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD ARM64 Linux MacOS Windows (non-native) It's called apelink.c and it's a fine piece of poetry that weaves together the Portable Executable, ELF, Mach-O, and PKZIP file formats into shell scripts that run on most PCs and servers without needing to be installed. This is an idea whose time has come; POSIX even changed their rules about binary in shell scripts specifically to let us do it. So we've been using it to create a \"Fat Linux Distro\" which I've named the \"Cosmos\". In the Cosmos, every program is statically linked and contains a PKZIP central directory where its /usr/share dependencies are embedded. You can think of it as a coalition of individualistic executables, where each program can be separated from the whole and run on other OSes. So far it includes programs like Emacs, Vim, CoreUtils, Curl, Git, etc. cosmos-3.0.1.zip 213mb - PE+ELF+MachO+ZIP+SH executables For AMD64+ARM64 on Linux+Mac+Windows+FreeBSD+NetBSD+OpenBSD ce256ededf106748a09f13bf47ace9ef0e6f115d963353d3d63c21302c5f28f4 More specifically, the above zip file contains fat binaries for ape, python, lua, qjs, vim, emacs, emacsclient, nano, llama, bash, dash, less, git, grep, curl, wget, tidy, zip, unzip, zstd, bzip2, sqlite3, life, nesemu1, make (GNU + SECCOMP + Landlock), gmake (GNU), redbean, greenbean, datasette, assimilate, rusage, ctags, wall, pledge, verynice, find, tree, basename, chgrp, cp, date, du, expr, groups, ls, mknod, nl, pathchk, pwd, rm, seq, shred, stat, tee, uname, users, who, basenc, chmod, csplit, dd, echo, factor, head, mktemp, nohup, pinky, rmdir, shuf, stty, test, true, unexpand, vdir, whoami, awk, chown, df, false, id, link, mv, nproc, pr, rsync, sleep, sum, truncate, uniq, yes, b2sum, chroot, dir, fmt, install, md5sum, numfmt, printenv, readlink, runcon, sort, sync, timeout, tsort, unlink, base32, cat, cksum, cut, dircolors, env, fold, join, ln, mkdir, od, printf, realpath, script, split, tac, touch, tty, wc, base64, chcon, comm, dirname, expand, kill, logname, mkfifo, nice, paste, ptx, sed, sha1sum, sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum, tail, tr, ttyinfo, and uptime. This only became possible in the last few months, in part thanks to Gautham Venkatasubramanian, who spent a few weekends of his PhD studies modifying the C language so it's possible to build conventional software with Cosmopolitan. Since then it's been out of the frying pan and into the fire, testing our library to see if it can support some of the most complex and mature projects in the open source community. Running the ./configure scripts and make check rules of projects (e.g. GMP) has done so much to help us fix bugs and battle test new features. Build Once Anywhere, Run Anywhere C/C++ One of the things we're most happy with, is that Cosmo's cross platform support is now good enough to support Cosmo development. We've traditionally only compiled code on x86 Linux. Devs using Cosmo would build their programs on Linux, and then copy the binaries to other OSes. Focusing on Linux-only helped us gain considerable velocity at the start of the project; the Cosmopolitan monorepo has two million lines of code. Today was the first day the whole thing compiled on Apple Silicon and Microsoft Windows systems, and using Cosmo-built tools. Windows Improvements In order to get programs like GNU Make and Emacs to work on Windows, we implemented new libraries for POSIX signals emulation. Cosmopolitan is now able to preempt i/o and deliver asynchronous signals on Windows, using a SetThreadContext() trick I learned from the Go developers. Cosmo does a considerably better job spawning processes now too. For example, we wrote a brand new posix_spawn() function that goes 10x faster than the posix_spawn() included with Cygwin. Cosmo's execve() can now reparent subprocesses, inherit non-stdio file descriptor, and our read() function now contains a termios driver which, for the first time, lets us poll() standard input on consoles. Cosmo binaries cleanly integrate with WIN32, depending pretty much only on KERNEL32, and your fat binaries won't have to live on a separate partition like WSL. MacOS Improvements While MacOS may not be the prodigal child of our support vector, this release brings improvements to MacOS users that are equally important. For starters, we now have first-class native ARM64 support. APE Loader also now dynamically links the officially blessed Apple libraries (e.g. libSystem.dylib) on ARM64, so there's less chance that Apple will break your binaries. We've also made semaphores and futexes much better on XNU, thanks to Grand Central Dispatch, and ulock on AMD64. Portability and Performance (Pick Two) The end result is that if you switch your Linux build process to use cosmocc instead of cc then the programs you build, e.g. Bash and Emacs, will just work on the command prompts of totally different platforms like Windows and MacOS, and when you run your programs there, it'll feel like you're on Linux. However portability isn't the only selling point. Cosmo Libc will make your software faster and use less memory too. For example, when I build Emacs using the cosmocc toolchain, Emacs thinks it's building for Linux. Then, when I run it on Windows: It actually goes 2x faster than the native WIN32 port that the Emacs authors wrote on their own. Cosmo Emacs loads my dotfiles in 1.2 seconds whereas GNU Emacs on Windows loads them in 2.3 seconds. Many years ago when I started this project, I had this unproven belief that portability toil could be abstracted by having a better C library. Now I think this is all the proof we need that it's not only possible to make software instantly portable, but actually better too. For example, one of the things you may be wondering is, \"these fat binary files are huge, wouldn't that waste memory?\" The answer is no, because Cosmo only pages into memory the parts of the executable you need. Take for example one of Linux's greatest hits: the Debian Almquist shell. $ ls -hal /usr/bin/dash -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 107K Nov 21 2022 /usr/bin/dash $ ls -hal /opt/cosmos/bin/dash -rwxr-xr-x 1 jart jart 983K Oct 15 19:14 /opt/cosmos/bin/dash Here we see Cosmo's six OS + two architecture fat binary dash is 30% bigger than the one that comes with Alpine Linux (which only supports x86-Linux and dynamically links a separate 600kb Musl library). But if I run them: $ rusage /usr/bin/dash -c true took 231µs wall time ballooned to 688kb in size needed 183us cpu (0% kernel) caused 34 page faults (100% memcpy) $ rusage /opt/cosmos/bin/dash -c true took 217µs wall time ballooned to 544kb in size needed 172us cpu (0% kernel) caused 36 page faults (100% memcpy) Here we see Cosmo's fat binary version of dash went faster and used less memory than an x86-Linux-only binary built for Musl Libc. This is due to (1) the magic of modern memory management, where CPU MMUs lazily load 4096 byte blocks at a time; and (2) how carefully apelink plans your executable layout. For example, all that code which is needed to support Windows (it takes a lot of code to support Windows) gets linked into its own special section of the binary, far away from what the MMU will want to page on UNIX systems. The same goes for the embedded ARM64 build. Since I'm running on AMD64 here, the ARM64 code is never loaded off disk. Compiler Install Guide You no longer need to choose between the amalgamation release or the cosmo monorepo. We now have a third preferred option, which is our new cosmocc command. It works pretty much the same as the cc command you already know. The Cosmopolitan README file has getting started instructions, which basically boil down to this: sudo mkdir -p /opt sudo chmod 1777 /opt git clone https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan /opt/cosmo export PATH=\"/opt/cosmo/bin:/opt/cosmos/bin:$PATH\" echo 'PATH=\"/opt/cosmo/bin:/opt/cosmos/bin:$PATH\"' >>~/.profile ape-install # optionally install a faster systemwide ape loader cosmocc --update # pull cosmo and rebuild toolchain If your development environment isn't x86_64 Linux, then you'll need to download the latest toolchain, rather than using the one that's vendored inside the cosmo repository. cd /opt/cosmo rm -rf o/third_party/gcc wget https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/releases/download/3.0.1/cosmocc-0.0.16.zip unzip cosmocc-0.0.16.zip If you're on Windows, then you need a shell before you can do any of the above. If you download the cosmos.zip file at the top of the page, it'll have a bin/ and libexec/ folder. Just extract those to your C:\\ drive. Then install Terminal Preview from the Microsoft Store, and configure it so that it launches C:\\bin\\bash -l as your shell. You'll naturally need a good unzip program in order to do this: one that supports symbolic links (a.k.a. reparse points). The cosmos zip includes InfoZIP, but you can download it directly here: unzip.exe. Now that your cosmo compiler is installed and added to your $PATH, you can build standard C and C++ programs as follows: cosmocc -o foo foo.c cosmoc++ -o bar bar.cc If you want to build programs as fat binaries, there's a special compiler now which can make the process easier than using the x86_64-unknown-cosmo-cc, aarch64-unknown-cosmo-cc, fixupobj, and apelink commands directly. This compiler works by manipulating your compiler flags so that a concomitant .aarch64/foo.o gets created for every foo.o you compile. It runs the x86_64 and aarch64 compilers in parallel too, so it doesn't go much slower than cosmocc at the end of the day. fatcosmocc -o foo foo.c fatcosmoc++ -o bar bar.cc Integrating with GNU Autotools projects is easy as well. export CC=cosmocc export CXX=cosmoc++ ./configure --prefix=/opt/cosmos make -j make install Refer to the README file for more detailed instructions. Also be sure to check out the ahgamut/superconfigure repository for the largest source of high-quality examples on how to build open source software using Cosmo. Production Web Servers This cosmos release includes the latest version of the redbean web server. This is a fat single-file forking Lua+SQLite+MbedTLS stack written by the Cosmopolitan authors originally to showcase the capabilities of the library for greenfield development. Cosmopolitan is good for more than just building old GNU code and redbean proves that. It's the third most upvoted hobby project in Hacker News history. A few weeks ago Berwyn Hoyt independently determined it to be the fastest Lua web server too! One of the reasons why redbean is a forking web server is because we didn't develop our own POSIX Threads implementation until last year. So we put a lot of thought into writing an example of how you can build a bare minimal threaded web server that's even faster than redbean, and it's called greenbean. There's a prebuilt fat binary for it in the cosmos.zip distribution above. Greenbean is 400 lines of liberally commented perfection. I still can't believe how good we got its memory usage, thanks to tricks like MAP_GROWSDOWN. On Linux, if I ask greenbean to spawn over 9,000 persistent worker threads: $ sudo prlimit --pid=$$ --nofile=18000 $ sudo prlimit --pid=$$ --nproc=18000 $ rusage greenbean 9001 listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080 listening on http://10.10.10.237:8080 greenbean workers=0 connections=0 messages=0 ^C shutting down... took 7,959,324µs wall time ballooned to 40,352kb in size needed 929,917us cpu (92% kernel) caused 10,039 page faults (100% memcpy) 54,689 context switches (99% consensual) Then it somehow only uses 40mb of peak resident memory, and according to htop, greenbean's virtual memory usage is 76,652kb. That's for 9,001 threads. Like redbean, greenbean is able to handle hundreds of thousands of requests per second on my Intel Core i9-9900, except (1) greenbean has better shared memory support, (2) it sets up and tears down connections faster, and (3) it lets you experience the joy of using Mike Burrows' *NSYNC library, which is the basis of Cosmopolitan's POSIX synchronization primitives. If you're not familiar with the man, he's the guy who coded Chubby and Altavista, a global search engine which was so efficient it only needed to operate on a single server. But you wouldn't think *NSYNC is as prolific as it is if you're only going off star count. My favorite thing about greenbean is how elegantly it reacts to CTRL-C. When you interrupt greenbean, it'll use the POSIX pthread_cancel() API to immediately terminate all the worker threads, so that shutdown happens without delay. Cancelation is one of the trickier concepts for a C library to get right. It's up there with threads, signals, and fork in terms of how its ramifications pervade everything. So similar to Musl Libc, we've put a lot of thought into ensuring that Cosmo does it correctly. Cosmo avoids cancelation race conditions the same way as Musl and Cosmo also implements Musl's PTHREAD_CANCEL_MASKED extension to the POSIX standard, which has seriously got to be one of Rich Felker's most brilliant ideas. Read the commentary in greenbean.c if you want to learn more. Some of you might view greenbean as just a toy example. In that case, if you want to see something based on greenbean that is actually running in production, then pay a visit to https://ipv4.games/ whose source code is in net/turfwar/turfwar.c and net/turfwar/.init.lua. This is a hybrid redbean + greenbean service, where redbean does the HTTPS frontend, and greenbean does the HTTP backend. Hackers love to unleash their botnets on the IPv4 Games, and it honestly isn't that hard to withstand a DDOS with 49,131,669 IPs when your web server can do a million requests per second. That's for a service where 99% of the requests are write requests. If you want to have fun with this server, then you're also welcome to check out our monitoring metrics while you do it. Cosmopolitan Games This cosmos.zip release includes several games you can play which have been vetted on all our supported platforms. For example you can actually play Nintendo in the terminal and it'll even work inside the Windows 10 command prompt. Getting poll(stdin) to work in Windows is a messier problem than even naming or cache invalidation, so it's super sweet that Cosmopolitan Third Edition is now able to abstract that complexity. Although in the case of our port of Bisqwit's fabulous NESEMU1 program, it turned out we didn't need poll() at all! Just calling read() and letting it be EINTR'd by setitimer() sixty times a second to pipe audio did the trick. So playing these games helped battle test our new signals implementation too. We may not have GUI support yet, but you can use your mouse in the terminal. On Windows, your mouse cursor will generate the same ANSI XTERM style control codes as it does on Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc. Try running the life program that's included in Cosmos. Left click draws cells. Space runs an iteration of the life game. Right click can drag the display. You can also ctrl+wheel to zoom the display in and out. To read the source code to this simple program, check out tool/viz/life.c. WASM Containers Boulder startup dylibso just announced a few weeks ago that they've adopted Cosmopolitan for their new product Hermit: Actually Portable Wasm. Hermit lets you create secure cross-platform executables for WebAssembly modules. It's worth a try! Cosmopolitan has a long history of serving the needs of the Wasm community. Our first major adopter back in early 2021 was actually the wasm3 project which provides a similarly great solution to running Wasm outside the browser. I'm happy to see these projects benefiting from the advantages Cosmopolitan has to offer. Will you be the next adopter? If so, feel free to reach out to me personally and I'll see what I can do to help you be successful: jtunney@gmail.com. You're also invited to join our Discord community. Funding Funding for Cosmopolitan Third Edition was crowdsourced from Justine Tunney's GitHub sponsors and Patreon subscribers, the backing of Mozilla's MIECO program, and the generous contributions of our developer community on Discord.

I would rather argue that portability between desktop OS matters today less than twenty years ago as the niches are carved out, WSL 2 becomes actually usable and the desktop metaphor as a whole declines. reply flakes 4 hours agorootparentprevI think a lot of the \"logical reason\" is driven by more the ephemeral, sandboxed, execution tools. e.g. a `docker run` or `serverless` architectures, where full root filesystems are populated on demand.

However portability isn&#x27;t the only selling point. Cosmo Libc will make your software faster and use less memory too.

Then, when I run it on Windows:> It actually goes 2x faster than the native WIN32 port that the Emacs authors wrote on their own.

A requirement to write portable C doesn’t seem so insurmountable to render the project a mere toy.The suite of useful tools included in the post seems like a good counter example to the claim that this is inherently not useful for anything serious.Fat multi-arch binaries are a thing on other platforms like darwin, where they are used extremely widely. What makes this approach so different? reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentMulti-arch seems completely different than multi-platform. The former is obviously useful, the user isn&#x27;t necessarily going to understand why a program which ran on their MacBook isn&#x27;t runnable on their older iMac because it&#x27;s ARM only. The two programs can also still use highly specific OS integrations, GPU acceleration APIs, and make assumptions about being a macOS system. The stretch to multi-platform comes at a much higher cost in limitations for a much more dubious level of gain, as badass as it is from a technical perspective. When I say \"cost\" e.g. on Windows I have to rename the executable to end in .exe be able to launch it, when I do simple text based programs like nano do run... but they are completely unusable. Bash runs but I can&#x27;t select, copy, or paste text with the mouse. It&#x27;s borderline unusable if the app does more than behind the scenes processing only.With that in mind, \"plugins\" to cross platform applications instead of standalone apps could be an interesting use case though. That&#x27;s something which has typically went towards per platform, interpreted&#x2F;jited, or VM&#x27;d solutions - all of which have their downsides for a typical user, don&#x27;t really care about the rest of the system as much, and don&#x27;t need to be anything but \"behind the scenes processing\" in most cases. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentprevISO C and POSIX don&#x27;t provide support for anything beyond CLI applications and daemons.Sure if one wants to live in the world of UNIX before X Windows, I guess it is ok. reply refulgentis 7 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s useful here either.

Is anyone working on Pyinstaller+Cosmopolitan integration? I guess a key issue there would be that many Python dependencies ship C extensions which are typically distributed as prebuilt platform-specific binary \"wheel\" packages via pip. I guess pip would need to start hosting a Cosmopolitan flavor of wheel package in addition to the native ones? reply jart 9 hours agoparentWhat I would prefer to see happen in the Python community is for Python packages to embed APE binaries and launch them as subprocesses (ideally using posix_spawn) because then you can mostly just ship pure Python with a few APE programs for your native needs, and nothing about the Python packaging ecosystem needs to change.That was my dream when I worked on the TensorFlow team. One of the questions I asked myself is, if a MatMul kernel takes milliseconds to perform an op, and it takes microseconds to launch a subprocess, then why do I need to dynamically link a 50mb TensorFlow DSO when I can just whip up a simple C program to perform the very small amount of native math, system calls, and data crunching that I need for TensorBoard?Well, now with Cosmopolitan, it&#x27;s finally possible. Just whip up the ~100 or so lines of C&#x2F;C++ code that&#x27;s impossible to do with Python into a small fat static APE binary, and vendor that program like any other .txt or .dat file asset. Then launch it when you need to, while never caring or needing to worry about shipping multiple .whl files or setting up Jenkins build farms for BSDs, Windows, etc. Life stays easy. reply chrismorgan 3 hours agorootparent> and it takes microseconds to launch a subprocessOn my laptop (ASUS GA503QM, 5800HS), running &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;true to completion takes around 400μs, demonstrated by these three different approaches to spawning a thousand processes: $ python -m timeit -n 1000 --setup &#x27;import subprocess&#x27; &#x27;subprocess.run([\"&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;true\"])&#x27; 1000 loops, best of 5: 441 usec per loop $ rustc -o x -Historically spawning processes was vastly slower on WindowsIndeed.> I’m not certain of the current state though I think it improved a few years agoIt did?

You could probably get it closer to 2-3ms on a faster machine, but that&#x27;s the ballpark. reply modeless 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure I understand fully. Are you saying that instead of e.g. writing a neural net in Python using PyTorch (which loads several native extensions into the Python interpreter) I should write the whole neural net in C using a C neural net library, and ship it as an executable that my Python code can launch as a subprocess whenever it wants to run a forward or backward pass? Or are you saying that I can use PyTorch in Python but instead of loading a native extension into the Python process it should ship an executable that it launches every time it wants to run a compute kernel? Or something else? reply jart 9 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. Let&#x27;s say you are a Python package author. You ship your app or library on PyPi to a lot of users. You have a problem that can be solved in 100 lines of C++, but it can&#x27;t be solved using Python code. Python would just go too slow. That&#x27;s a problem, because in order to introduce a single line of native code into your Python package, it would require assuming numerous burdens relating to compilation and distribution. Native code is hard. Native code being hard is the whole reason we use high-level languages like Python. It&#x27;s hard because you&#x27;d have to setup a devops process to build and test your C code on all these different operating systems. So what I&#x27;m proposing that you consider instead, is compile the ~100 lines of C&#x2F;C++ code you want as a ~100kb fat APE binary, on your one dev system of choice, using Cosmo. Then embed that APE executable inside your pure Python package, launch it as a subprocess, and never have to worry about devops and distribution toil. reply modeless 9 hours agorootparentI like that idea for a lot of applications (I also like the python \"multiprocessing\" library, other languages could learn a thing or two from it, and it really takes the sting out of the GIL). But I don&#x27;t see it working well for something like numpy or PyTorch which are sharing arbitrary memory between Python and native and calling back and forth at a very high frequency.PyTorch and the neural net implementations built on it are the whole reason I&#x27;m using Python at all. If the answer was \"build the native extensions you need for PyTorch&#x2F;etc into the Python binary\" that would be fine too, I have no love for dynamic library loading. But I don&#x27;t see the PyTorch team going out of their way to change anything about their build process or runtime to work with Cosmopolitan, as much as I wish they would, so my guess is I won&#x27;t be able to use Cosmopolitan Python for the foreseeable future. reply paulclinger 9 hours agoparentprevThere is no support for dynamic libraries in Cosmopolitan right now, so the libraries would either need to be compiled in (statically) or included in the archive as Python-only libraries. With the later ones, it should be a matter of adding them to the zip archive within the cosmo python executable, which should make them available to your scripts.

You could borrow BSD ld.so.1 code, I suppose.Ah, that brings me to something else that someone like jart might want to take on:# bringing static linking for C into the 21st centuryWhat&#x27;s wrong with static linking in C? Well, it&#x27;s still stuck with 1970s semantics, while dynamic linking has much nicer semantics. Specifically: - static linking flattens the dependency tree, which causes - symbol collision issues - also, there&#x27;s no RPATH equiv. for static linkingMy thinking is to: - write dependency metadata (-lfoo, rpath, -L&#x2F;...) into a \"hidden\" .o that has just this metadata encoded in it - make the static linker look for that metadata in dependencies and resolve conflicts the same way as in dynamic linking - for each link-edit, including the final link-edit of the executable, require only that direct -lfoo dependencies be listedWell, anyways, it&#x27;s a lot to ask :( reply athrun 6 hours agoparentNot disagreeing with your overall point, but symbol collision is still very much an issue with dynamic linking on Linux right?AFAIK, the gnu dynamic linker doesn&#x27;t do any namespacing (as opposed to Solaris&#x27;). reply cryptonector 5 hours agorootparentLinux has versioned symbols, and Solaris&#x2F;Illumos has direct binding. The two schemes achieve roughly the same result: that the bindings made at link-edit time are the bindings you get a run-time.In the versioned symbols case this is done via decorating symbols in the dependent with the SONAME and version of the dependency that is expected to provide them. In direct binding this is done by decorating symbols in the dependent with just the SONAME of the dependency that is expected to provide them.The versioned symbol technique allows a shared object to provide multiple versions of a symbol with the same name, which can be useful for some things, but direct binding is just much easier to use than versioned symbols: just add `-B direct` to the link-edits and you&#x27;re done.Even in the absence of symbol versioning and direct binding, the fact that each object records its dependencies means that symbol conflicts will be only among those dependencies, and this can be discovered at link-edit time.LD_PRELOAD interposers, on the other hand, can cause symbol conflicts in spite of all the foregoing. For this you can use `-B protected` or similar, but you may not want to. reply forrestthewoods 2 hours agoparentprevLinux and Windows have very different dynamic linking strategies.

If you build APE binaries, then you should do that too: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;wdsi&#x2F;filesubmission?persona=... Every time I submit the form, Microsoft whitelists them with zero hassle. They even let you upload a single zip file containing hundreds of executables, and they&#x27;ll take care of them all. It&#x27;s great. Doing that ensures Windows Defender won&#x27;t cause issues. The good news is most other AVs are plugged into the same database as Defender (even Google Search bases their analysis on Microsoft&#x27;s security intelligence) so that form actually gets you off the radar of a lot of AVs. As for CrowdStrike, if you have contacts there, then I&#x27;d be happy to share with them information about what our team is building and shipping, as well as documentation on the APE file format, in addition to free consultation from me for any help they need supporting it on their end.

The request goes to the correct IP address, and then my ISP does the MITM attack based on the IP address. So, instead of getting justine.lol&#x27;s SSL certificate, I get a certificate instead for *.safezone.mcafee.com. Firefox correctly flags this as a bad SSL cert, and I don&#x27;t want to accept the bad cert, so I basically just don&#x27;t have internet access to these websites using my ISP. reply jart 10 hours agorootparentAuthor here. I use MbedTLS to serve justine.lol using Let&#x27;s Encrypt and TLS v2 with a permissive policy regarding older (but not yet obsolete) crypto formats and protocol versions (because I like supporting old browsers and old operating systems). If there&#x27;s a weakness in the way I&#x27;m doing it, then I want to know about it. It might be possible that your client accepts older weaker SSL varieties and the MiTM is using that somehow as an attack vector. If so, you can try changing your browser settings. It might also be time for me to consider trading away some compatibility by forcing clients to use stronger security. Let me know what you learn!

The study, led by Associate Professor Matthew Pase, from the Monash School of Psychological Sciences and the Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health in Melbourne, Australia, and published today in JAMA Neurology, looked at 346 participants, over 60 years of age, enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study who completed two overnight sleep studies in the time periods 1995 to 1998 and 2001 to 2003, with an average of five years between the two studies. These participants were then carefully followed for dementia from the time of the second sleep study through to 2018. The researchers found, on average, that the amount of deep sleep declined between the two studies, indicating slow wave sleep loss with ageing. Over the next 17 years of follow-up, there were 52 cases of dementia. Even adjusting for age, sex, cohort, genetic factors, smoking status, sleeping medication use, antidepressant use, and anxiolytic use, each percentage decrease in deep sleep each year was associated with a 27 per cent increase in the risk of dementia. “Slow-wave sleep, or deep sleep, supports the ageing brain in many ways, and we know that sleep augments the clearance of metabolic waste from the brain, including facilitating the clearance of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease,” Associate Professor Pase said. “However, to date we have been unsure of the role of slow-wave sleep in the development of dementia. Our findings suggest that slow wave sleep loss may be a modifiable dementia risk factor.” Associate Professor Pase said that the Framingham Heart Study is a unique community-based cohort with repeated overnight polysomnographic (PSG) sleep studies and uninterrupted surveillance for incident dementia. “We used these to examine how slow-wave sleep changed with ageing and whether changes in slow-wave sleep percentage were associated with the risk of later-life dementia up to 17 years later,” he said. “We also examined whether genetic risk for Alzheimer’s Disease or brain volumes suggestive of early neurodegeneration were associated with a reduction in slow-wave sleep. We found that a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but not brain volume, was associated with accelerated declines in slow wave sleep.” Read the full paper in JAMA Neurology: Association Between Slow-Wave Sleep Loss and Incident Dementia.

So much so that I don&#x27;t change positions at all, and my body slightly aches from being in the same position so long. My bladder nearly feels like it&#x27;s going to burst, because I&#x27;ve slept so long.There was a study I saw while back that said eating cruciferous vegetables speeds up caffeine metabolism. I&#x27;ve tried that, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help. The caffeine still seemed to disturb my sleep. I tried BrocoMax, a broccoli supplement, that didn&#x27;t seem to help either.Exercise helps a little bit. But it&#x27;s still not the quality of sleep I receive with zero caffeine.I think much faster when I drink caffeine. Recently I revisited this issue and tried micro-dosing 5-Hour Energy (2mL). At first it seemed promising. But then it seems to slowly build up in my system. Sleep quality deteriorates slower. But the deterioration is there. I prematurely posted this status.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;aantix&#x2F;status&#x2F;1706020516060971399Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t appear that I can drink caffeine and have quality sleep.I hate that I have to choose. reply rcconf 17 hours agoparentI have the same issue, it&#x27;s truly unfortunate. What&#x27;s odd is I forget about what caffeine does to my sleep and after a few weeks&#x2F;months of drinking it, I&#x27;m wondering why I&#x27;m so stressed, tired and can&#x27;t get ANY sleep.I stop drinking coffee and BAM, I sleep like a baby. It doesn&#x27;t MATTER when I drink it, I can drink it at 6AM and I will not have a good deep sleep. I am unsure if this is coincidence, but I also notice I remember way less dreams when I am on caffeine than not. I also find it&#x27;s a compounding effect which is why it&#x27;s slightly annoying.If I drink 1 cup, in 2 weeks, my sleep will be fine so I will think, okay, it&#x27;s not the caffeine. Then I will continue drinking it for weeks and suddenly I haven&#x27;t had a good nights rest in weeks and I&#x27;m wondering what is going on. Not having deep sleep for weeks really has a big impact on your stress levels, memory, emotional well being and general energy levels.The annoying part is coffee is so good for productivity so I go through cycles (also you start to think it&#x27;s the stress not the caffeine that&#x27;s causing the sleep issue!)Weeks of stressful work - drink more caffeine to get all the work done - bad sleep, bad mood, bad energy levels, aka all the negative affects from not having enough deep sleep.Weeks of less stressful work, no caffeine, great sleep, great mood&#x2F;energy levels, etc.I&#x27;ve always convinced myself that not drinking caffeine for deep sleep is just placebo, but I&#x27;ve tested it so many times that it just can&#x27;t be.Is there a way to test if you&#x27;re a slower metabolizer?

Both the C&#x2F;C and A&#x2F;C genotype are slow caffeine metabolizers. The most common genotype is A&#x2F;A, which is a fast metabolizer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;snp&#x2F;rs762551 reply jamroom 13 hours agorootparentDo you have a link to one that shows A&#x2F;C?

I don&#x27;t find this paper particularly meaningful, but the effects they did observe showed A&#x2F;C and C&#x2F;C to be about the same, and both different than A&#x2F;A.This is based on a 5 hour after caffeine ingestion blood test in smokers. They found no differences in the non-smokers, but those were urine tests taken at variable times (whenever they peed), which seems sketchy to me.Based on this study, subsequent studies (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;16522833&#x2F;) seem to group A&#x2F;C and C&#x2F;C together, and not look at them independently.

I&#x27;ve found that cycling caffeine through the week (taking a break on weekends) and just not having too much even during the week can help maintain the productivity, but it also means spending my weekends in a tired daze. I think I just need to commit to not having any caffeine, or if I do, only taking it temporarily before stopping again. reply Obscurity4340 11 hours agorootparentprevSo if I can fall asleep after moderate amounts (like, right away after intake), this prolly doesn&#x27;t affect me, no? reply mattgreenrocks 15 hours agorootparentprevFascinating. What are your deep sleep totals on and off caffeine? reply krrrh 15 hours agoparentprevFor anyone reading this and wanting to get off caffeine, but finding it difficult because of withdrawal symptoms like headaches, here’s a trick that makes it easier.If you’re drinking a morning coffee you’ll be getting 100-200mg of caffeine. But even a small amount of caffeine will take almost all the edge off withdrawal and prevent headaches. A 75g dark chocolate bar at 70% will give you 20-25mg of caffeine. Costco sells boxes of Lindt chocolate bars that meet this criteria. Eat one in the morning instead of coffee (the sugar and theobromine seems to help as well). Once you’ve done this for a week it’s easy to just stop because most people won’t get withdrawal symptoms from 20mg. reply taude 14 hours agorootparentI typically weigh my coffee, either for making espresso (20g) or for pourovers (25g). Last time I quit, went like this: a) move from two espressos -> one espresso for a few days. Once steady on a single 20g espresso... b) move from 20g espresso to 20g pouroer. c) each day take a few grams off the pour over. The last time I made one I used 5 mg beans, and then quit pretty easily the next day.This taper method made it totally doable for me, no headaches. The hardest part was going from 2 espressos to 1, mostly because of the habit. I substituted in herbal tea for my second cup.... reply quotz 7 hours agorootparentWhy americans drink 20g espressos is beyond me. Thats a triple espresso in european standards. A single espresso is 7 grams. Having double espresso in america would basically translate to 6 espressos in europe. I moved from Europe to New York City a few years ago and I always ask the baristas how many grams is their espresso and they dont know. I ask them if the single espresso drink they have is essentially dopio espresso and they have no clue what i am talking about. And on top of that it costs 4$ for an espresso + taxes which equals to around 4.50$. Coffee culture in NYC is subpar to any major european city, and I am afraid to even find out hows it like in other cities in the US!

Note that before this experiment I hadn&#x27;t had any caffeine at all for several years because I was pretty sure it affected me badly.(1) Experimenter dissolved measured weight caffeine powder in water, and divided it into various measured portions, and labeled them with unique numbers. Then made identical measured portions of pure water, also labeled. She sealed the number assignments in an envelope.(2) On experiment days, I chose a water portion, recording the day and number in secret - she could not see which portion I chose or what number it was. I then poured the water into whatever (zero caffeine!) drink (or whatever else I could mix it in with) I was having.

I was recommended it by others for sleep, and I have got a lot of people started. Within a few days our sleep is just so much better, including deeper dreams. I do 100mg lysinate glycinate.

I do like naps though, and find them refreshing. Have you found research that supports this? reply beezlebroxxxxxx 20 hours agorootparentThe primary benefit from mid-day naps is that they simply help you relax and get some rest. You don&#x27;t want them to be long, just refreshing. This is well known in athletics where most major athletes take naps as a matter of recovery and to improve their sleep quality. Presumably, feeling relaxed and rested when you go to sleep helps you get some deeper sleep and improve sleep quality. reply dev_hugepages 13 hours agorootparentprevI recommend to read https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Best_time_for_napping The key takeaways is that naps won&#x27;t affect night time sleep much if it&#x27;s timed well. I also don&#x27;t recommend stopping them artificially (I&#x27;ve heard the \"keep them short\" advice a lot), naps are usually short if you aren&#x27;t sleep deprived and time it well. reply musha68k 18 hours agorootparentprevAFAIR was only the case if nap was longer than ~20 min? I don&#x27;t remember if this was a consistent thing, I doubt it though as this stuff is inherently individual. Experimentation is the only way with sleep optimization.. reply jlpom 16 hours agorootparentprevIt does not worsen night sleep, this is a misconception. It is better than nothing but often not as good as regular sleep since you often does not goes through a full cycle. reply 2devnull 18 hours agorootparentprevNaps are terrible sleep hygiene. Any deviation from a regular set sleep schedule is bad hygiene. Better to get less sleep than to nap and disturb the sleep schedule. Many people develop insomnia this way, especially shift workers. reply dev_hugepages 12 hours agorootparentThe siesta is natural and is different from the naps taken from shift workers that are likely either interrupting night time sleep or are shifting their circadian rythm so that their \"biological night\" is in the day.

That sounds like you aren&#x27;t getting enough.Do yourself a favor. Take off the nightcap, put on the striped pajamas and the old-timey candle holder, and book out a full 10 hours for a few weeks. Make it non-negotiable. Full darkness, clean air, quiet, the works. Maybe even get tested for sleep apnea if you&#x27;re overweight.If you go through that for 3 weeks religiously and return to the nightcap I&#x27;ll eat my words and consider you a medical anomaly. But I think you&#x27;ll come out of it convinced it&#x27;s worth the sacrifice. reply twh270 20 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a good list (though I personally find it impossible to nap during the day). I&#x27;d add one thing: reduce stress. reply wombat-man 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I sleep way better if I go to bed totally sober. Generally caffeine seems to be ok if I stop after 3pm or so. reply nick222226 19 hours agorootparentYep, as I get into my 30s I notice alcohol consumption drastically affects my sleep quality and time to fall asleep.I&#x27;ve also cut out coffee and that has helped my sinuses&#x2F;upper throat a lot in the morning which were being irritated. I drink some varieties of tea instead. reply VirusNewbie 16 hours agorootparentprev>Cutting out caffeine and alcohol entirely from my diet were by far the biggest improvements I madeAre you sure the latter improved deep sleep? Alcohol is known to interfere with REM sleep, but I&#x27;ve actually found it lengthens the amount of time I spend in deep sleep if I have a single beer or something at dinner. I tracked this over months with a sleep tracker. reply jacobsimon 20 hours agoparentprevI think the other key question is causality - do people who get less deep sleep develop these diseases, or do people who are developing these diseases get less deep sleep, or both?I wonder if they could design an interventional study in which people who are predisposed to dementia are given more sleep or melatonin, and then demonstrate whether it protects against the disease. reply kzz102 19 hours agorootparentThe study does not prove causality: it is right in the title of the paper: Association Between Slow-Wave Sleep Loss and Incident Dementia.Sorry for the rant: we should not share university press release articles, they are always clickbait.

So, for those who didn&#x27;t click all the way through: There is zero proof of causation. It may well be that people getting dementia have increased problems sleeping.

I guess people who are not getting enough deep sleep are also stressed. reply bnralt 20 hours agoparentprevOne thing I’ve found that really helps is actually not worrying too much about sleep. Try to follow good basic habits, but you can become neurotic trying to follow every suggestion that people make or thinking that a few nights of horrible sleep is going to damage you for life. If I get a few nights of poor sleep nowadays I try to just shrug it off. reply leokennis 19 hours agorootparentI have a feeling that the more \"advanced\" tips seen in this thread are more (personal) solutions&#x2F;improvements for the situation of \"I am stressed and so I cannot sleep well\". I.e. to make a non-optimal situation a little better.Which is fine, but in general I&#x27;d think having the luxury of being in a calm, comfortable and unworried state of mind is the most beneficial. reply heipei 20 hours agoparentprevPersonal anecdote, but I sleep with earplugs most of the nights as I have a very light sleep. I would wake from really small noises multiple times every night. In contrast, sleeping with earplugs feels like entering a dark and quiet chamber and then suddenly emerging after 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

The only only ones I&#x27;ve been able to sleep with at all are silicone ones that mould to the shape of the ear. I can only sleep which makes things significantly more difficult but with some practice I can get the silicone ones flat and not feeling like there&#x27;s pressure inside my ear which will stop me sleeping.I don&#x27;t travel without these now and they have been great, but after several successive nights of use I find my ear starts to get sore and sensitive to them.The best thing, of course, is to live somewhere actually quiet. Most noise is from cars. But failing that I have to sleep with some white noise source like a fan. reply prirun 19 hours agorootparentI use these earplugs every night and whenever I&#x27;m exposed to noise, like vacuuming. For me, it helps me sleep better and also seems to reduce tinnitus. Note: I&#x27;m not saying wearing earplugs directly reduces tinnitus, but IMO it reduces ear stimulation because my ears are processing less sound, so my ears don&#x27;t get as tired, and that seems to make my tinnitus less noticeable.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B0051U7W32I re-use the same set, washing them when I take a shower. I bought the above set of 50 years ago and still have many left.A couple of tricks I use with these:- I cut about 1&#x2F;4\" off the small end. If I don&#x27;t, the earplug starts to hurt my ear if I wear it a lot, I think because it goes too far into my ear.- before using a new earplug, I wash it several times with bar soap. There is something in a new ear plug that makes it stay mashed. Maybe it suppresses more noise with that, but it also makes it hard to fit for me. I keep washing it until it is springy. This is a one-time thing with a new ear plug. reply globular-toast 18 hours agorootparentThe \"stay mashed\" property is by design for these types of earplugs because they are meant to go right into the ear canal. The idea is you mash them (well, carefully roll and compress) then insert them while still mashed, holding them in as they slowly re-expand.But this is, of course, to ensure protection in the case of dangerously high sound pressure levels. Cutting them would also compromise them in this regard. Perhaps different if you are using them to block out low noises for sleep. reply knicholes 19 hours agorootparentprevWhenever I use these, I have to wake up in the middle of the night because my ear canals are all wet inside. Does this not happen to you? reply globular-toast 18 hours agorootparentYes, but I think to a lesser extent. I have not felt uncomfortable in the night due to this, but my ears definitely feel more moist in the morning which probably contributes to the soreness&#x2F;sensitivity over time for me. reply walthamstow 19 hours agorootparentprevSimilar for me, I use a blindfold and white noise to create a sleep cocoon with no distractions reply rashkov 18 hours agorootparentSame, highly recommend the manta sleep mask for any back sleepers reply canadiantim 16 hours agorootparentI just repeat mantras until all the sheep are counted, works like a charm reply proee 18 hours agoparentprevExercise HARD. Try doing some Zone 2 cardio for +1 hours, and see if this makes a difference. Or try some HIIT workout (Zone 5) and see how your body responds. A good overall workout machine is a rower. Try to set some kind of PR, like a 2k time trial. Push beyond what you think is possible and see how your body responds. My best sleeps are when I am physically exhausted - so weak that I could fall asleep on a couch (which is normally impossible for me). reply gjstein 18 hours agorootparentI have some mixed feelings about this. I used to do this ~10 years ago when I was a distance runner, but now exercising so hard will throw my body off in other ways and I don&#x27;t feel good having pushed so hard. Perhaps this is exactly the point you&#x27;re making, but I don&#x27;t target zone 5 for long these days. Deep sleep, sure, but at what cost to the rest of my body? reply brigadier132 17 hours agorootparentAll exercise causes fatigue and fatigue management is not really discussed but it&#x27;s actually not that difficult. Most of your cardio should be done in zone 2 (look up the 80&#x2F;20 rule). You also may need to start with easier workouts and work your way back up to what you expect you can do. I was also a former endurance athlete and in college I stopped exercising. Numerous times I kept on trying to get back into it and I didn&#x27;t succeed at getting back into it until I realized that I needed to start from square 1.I&#x27;m not fully back into it yet mind you, but I&#x27;m running 20 miles a week and lifting weights 6 days a week. A lot of my workouts are zone 2. I sleep at least 8 hours and I get roughly 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight from my diet (i also make sure all my other macro and micro nutrient needs are met).The excessive fatigue goes away if you are meeting your nutrient and sleep requirements and not consuming drugs or alcohol. Look up the \"repeated bout effect\". I feel like a teenager again after getting my exercise, nutrition, and sleep routine locked in.edit: To clarify what I mean about \"the excessive fatigue goes away\", when I first started running there would be mornings where I would wake up and have significant mental and physical fatigue and the very thought of going to exercise was repulsive to me. That goes away with time, it&#x27;s also a signal to maybe take it easy for the day and do zone 2 cardio instead. reply proee 17 hours agorootparentprevFor sure, there is some kind of optimal balance to target. I&#x27;ve pushed myself so hard at times that I disrupted my sleep. For example, I bought a used Kickr and decided to do a FTP test at 9pm.

    "originBody": "Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is. Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest. Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.) Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures. Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim \"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as \"When in doubt, use brute force.\". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often shortened to \"write stupid code that uses smart objects\".",

If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.I completely agree with this. Which is why all the LeetCode interviews always struck me as odd. They focus on algorithms, not data structures, which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want to do out of the gate, most of the time.I suppose, if you don&#x27;t know algorithms at all you wouldn&#x27;t realize when it is eitherA) an exception to the ruleorB) A time where you need to lean into specific algorithm for X, Y or Z reasonHowever, you can teach algorithms in relatively short order, I have honestly found people grok which data structures to use less easily, though its all anecdotal reply softfalcon 18 hours agoparentI can also anecdotally agree with your analysis. I&#x27;ve seen for myself how much more some folks will respect you during interviews if you \"get past\" the part about fizzbuzz (algorithms) and move onto immediately talking about data structures, architecture, and how that analogues to the domain in question.All of the sudden, the interviewer relaxes and you can just see on their face the, \"oh, we&#x27;ve got an actual senior engineer on the call here.\" They open up about their technical problems and stop caring about \"proving if you can even code\".Similarly, the teams I&#x27;ve had the most problems creating positive change, meeting milestones, or collaborating together properly as a team with is where no one seems to have a good grasp of data structures and code architecture. It seems to have become more common too. Many folks are quite used to having a framework that can just do everything, and if it can&#x27;t, someone \"smarter than them\" has made a plugin or middleware to save them from having to think too hard.I personally find engineers who avoid data structures to be shooting themselves in the foot, they&#x27;re giving up on one of the most useful tools in their arsenal and I witness how it limits them day-to-day. It&#x27;s tough to watch. reply pklausler 17 hours agorootparentAsking \"FizzBuzz\" is not done to test algorithmic knowledge. reply dagw 18 hours agoparentprevWhich is why all the LeetCode interviews always struck me as odd. They focus on algorithms, not data structuresI helped my nephew preparing some competitive coding event, and transforming the data into the right data structure was a huge part of solving most problems. For example most of the code you might end up writing is for finding the longest path through a weighted DAG, but the trick was realising that you could represent the problem as a weighted DAG, and if you did then the length of the longest path through that graph was your answer. If you didn&#x27;t spot that then you might very well still be able to solve the problem, but your solution would end up being much slower and more complicated. reply mikhailfranco 17 hours agorootparentThis is the low-hanging fruit algorithm:- build the DAG with heavy nodes (e.g. lead split-shot)- use string or fishing line for edges, with length proportional to &#x27;weights&#x27;- hold the root node(s) high in the air, if more than one, hold them together, at the same height- the lowest node, or the length of taught line (drop distance below your hand), is the answer reply a1369209993 14 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t actually work, because a DAG only lacks directed cycles. Consider: &#x2F;-3-> D A -1-> B -1-> C \\------4------^In this case, the longest path is A-C, but C will be held at level 2 by B, leaving D lowest at level 3. This works for a fully-acyclic directed graph (eg a tree), but not for a directed-acyclic directed graph. It can also find the node whose shortest path is the longest (so longest shortest path, minimax style). (It also works for a acyclic undirected graph, as illustrated at [0], but that&#x27;s a bit tangential.)0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wGrOPSBPpyk reply mikhailfranco 4 hours agorootparentYes, you are completely correct.It only works for fruit trees. reply roughly 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s great is that it’s constant time, once you’ve prepared the data structure. Never underestimate the parallelism of physical systems. reply pfisherman 18 hours agorootparentprevHow much of this is finding the right data structure (graph) vs translating the problem into a new domain?I think maybe the former follows from the latter? reply jasode 19 hours agoparentprev>Which is why all the LeetCode interviews always struck me as odd. They focus on algorithms, not data structures, The typical leetcode questions also focus on \"data structures\" because the candidate needs to have the mental catalog of data structures in his brain to pull from when he \"pattern matches\" on the problem&#x2F;solution.The interviewer isn&#x27;t going to volunteer whether the candidate needs a \"priority queue\", or \"adjacency matrix\", or \"trie\", etc to solve various algorithm questions. If the candidate is stuck, then the interviewer might give a hint to the data structure to use. But of course, too much hand-holding will not make the candidate come across as a strong hire signal. reply no_wizard 19 hours agorootparentIts been a time since I interviewed in such a manner, perhaps things have shifted. When I was interviewing a few years back, it was algorithm heavy, often a basic data structure was provided and there was alot of focus on traversal (hence the memes around reversing binary trees and such) reply Icathian 16 hours agorootparentTo add another point of anecdata, my experience very recently at tech companies aligns with the parent comment. reply mikebenfield 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t really see how you can choose one without at least a rough idea of the other. How do you know what data structure to use if you have no idea how you&#x27;ll be accessing the data? reply no_wizard 17 hours agorootparentI have found you can, even if its slowest of the slowest, brute force your way through traversal of a data structure, if you need to, since most languages (all?) give you iteration out of the box.Being able to choose the appropriate data structure and explain trade-offs etc is much more valuable than simply knowing how to reverse a binary tree sorta stuff.As I noted elsewhere in the thread, I haven&#x27;t interviewed in awhile where I needed to grind out DS&A questions, but at the time where I did, I often found myself given a particular structure and asked to traverse it in some way, with is pretty heavy on the algorithmic thinking but not really testing my knowledge on data structures themselves.Sounds to me like things have become a little more even handed out there reply BearOso 8 hours agorootparent> Being able to choose the appropriate data structure and explain trade-offs etc is much more valuable than simply knowing how to reverse a binary tree sorta stuff.Indeed. The simplest way to invert a binary tree is to include an \"invert\" flag in the data structure. If it&#x27;s set, walk the tree right to left instead of left to right. reply softfalcon 18 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not wrong, data structures and an algorithm for data retrieval are often connected and developed together. You often see someone come up with a novel way of traversing data, then they model an elegant data structure to match it and enable said traversal.What isn&#x27;t covered in this flow is how composition of multiple data-structure&#x2F;algorithm pairings work together amidst many others. It&#x27;s often not an algorithm on its own that defines an overall solution. It&#x27;s the connecting of many of them together, to build a whole software stack, domain language, etc.When you understand the algorithms, the corresponding data structures, when to use them, similarities in various frameworks in your chosen domain, how that analogues to your current problem set, etc you really start getting somewhere. reply eska 17 hours agorootparent* data structures and an algorithm for data retrieval are often connected and developed together*Often? Always! An algorithm always only works on a certain data data structure. reply nonrandomstring 17 hours agorootparentOr as Fred Brooks put it: \" Show me your tables, and I won&#x27;t usually need your flowcharts; they&#x27;ll be obvious.\"But to be fair, you need to be a pretty damn good comp sci person (and actively thinking in algs and DS) to quickly look at DS and see the \"obvious\" processing implied. reply sfn42 16 hours agorootparentA problem I see a lot is when the flowcharts should be obvious, but aren&#x27;t because whoever wrote the code didn&#x27;t write the obvious solution.Instead they wrote a horrible buggy mess that tries (and usually fails at least a little) to do the same thing as the obvious solution but with much more, and more convoluted, code. reply softfalcon 17 hours agorootparentprevI appreciate your particularness in this regard, and you&#x27;ll have to forgive me as I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time with folks who are very wary of the word \"data structures\".I tend to use softer words like \"often\" as it makes folks feel less defensive towards the discussion. If someone came up to you and told you that your outlook on something is 100% definitively wrong, you might balk at the statement merely because I said \"100%\". Just as you have stated \"Always!\" and corrected me so emphatically.Since I&#x27;ve found this to be a difficult topic for some, and given this is a public forum, I chose to be cautious in my wording. reply a1369209993 14 hours agorootparentAlso they&#x27;re just straightforwardly wrong. For example, binary search works on a array, or on a predicate like \\x->(x*xlinked lists don&#x27;t have random access`list.get_nth(n)` has O(N) runtime, as does `list.length()`, so binary search is actually completely possible, with runtime O(N^2) (aka \"works very badly\").(Fair point that all four data structures need to be sorted, though, although ideally that would go without saying, since it&#x27;s kind of inherent in what binary search is.) replybob1029 16 hours agoparentprevAll software is effectively a set of ETL jobs with a user-friendly interface wrapped around. Those fancy algorithms, languages, frameworks, etc are simply a very ceremonious way to get data from A to B.The schema&#x2F;data are completely agnostic to the computation. You don&#x27;t even need a computer. 100% of schemas are possible to print out on sheets of physical paper and iterate offline. reply gridspy 14 hours agorootparentComputer used to be the job title for people who DID do this by hand. It was co-opted by the technology which replaced the job.Of course modern computation is often impractical to do by hand. It might even be so complex that humans would make too many errors and take to long to ever complete correctly. reply esafak 14 hours agorootparentCommon use cases were abstracted into libraries and services because nobody should have to reinvent the wheel. This let people operate at a higher level of abstraction and concentrate on more complicated tasks. These too became abstracted, and the cycle repeated. reply sirsinsalot 8 hours agorootparentprevWhile true, I think this is reductive.When you&#x27;re dealing with most modern software, there&#x27;s so many of these ETL-like pipelines, abstractions, black-boxes and just sprawling complexity that the job becomes much more about complexity management than anything.No component exists in a vacuum, I would argue software is as much about managing the complexity of the data and algorithms towards a purpose as it is about the purpose, data or algorithms.Entropy comes for us all, after all. reply jacobgorm 17 hours agoparentprevSee also Peter Naur&#x27;s letter to the editor in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;365719.366510 . In Denmark, CS is not called CS but Datalogy. reply asalahli 15 hours agorootparentI prefer the term Informatics over Computer Science for this reason. reply lawn 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not a fan of leetcode, but when I did some competitive programming it was quite common that you first had to transform the input data into the proper data structure, and then you can apply some algorithm to produce the answer. reply galaxyLogic 16 hours agoparentprevIf you want a better data-structure you must ask: Better for whom? Better for the algorithm that manipulates the data!So I don&#x27;t think that \"data dominates\". You may need to adapt your data to the algorithm or vice versa. What dominates is what we want to do. Without algorithm we are doing nothing.In a sense data is part of the algorithm, it is implicitly coded into the assumptions the algorithm makes about its arguments and results. reply samhuk 16 hours agoparentprevAlthough LeetCode does have a strong algo slant, choosing the optimal data structure is almost always a key part in solving the problems.If you think leetcode-like problems is always about the algo, \"BFS or DFS\" etc., then at best you are not realizing the data structure choices you are making, at worst you may not be so good at solving them or haven&#x27;t progress that much through leetcode-like challenges. reply bitwize 19 hours agoparentprev\"Show me your flowcharts, but keep your tables hidden, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won&#x27;t need to see your flowcharts, they&#x27;ll be obvious.\" reply kwhitefoot 19 hours agorootparentYou forgot the credit: Fred Brooks, Mythical Man Month, reply jrpelkonen 14 hours agorootparentprevGreat quote and so true in the general case. Unfortunately, I have seen some database designs that have left me more mystified than I was before. reply capableweb 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen programs that got more mystical the more the employees showed me how it worked internally. reply usrbinbash 14 hours agoparentprev> Which is why all the LeetCode interviews always struck me as odd. They focus on algorithms, not data structures, which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want to do out of the gate, most of the time.Which is one of the reasons why I will never use that style of problems as an interview question.And the other reason is: that style of problems also don&#x27;t teach anything about architecture. reply TeMPOraL 16 hours agoparentprev> >Data dominates. If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.I&#x27;ve been thinking about it a lot. I want to still believe it, but then my experience tells me that the \"right data structure\" is usually \"the data structure most convenient for the operations&#x2F;algorithms you want to run\". Which makes this principle either backward, or circular. reply nyssos 11 hours agorootparentThe right data structure is the one that&#x27;s produced and consumed in a way that matches the domain you&#x27;re trying to model. That domain can be inputs to a particular algorithm, but it can also be things like \"states of this system\" (constructors correspond to state transitions), \"witnesses to this property\" (constructors correspond to valid inferences), etc. reply TeMPOraL 9 hours agorootparentLeaving aside the unusual, to me, meaning of \"domain\" in this context, your description matches what I wrote above: the right data structure is determined by what you&#x27;re planning to do with the data.It only convinces me further that Pike&#x27;s take is wrong. Specifically:- \"Data dominates\" and \"Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming\" are just plain wrong;- \"If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident\" is correct only in the descriptive sense, not in the prescriptive sense. That is, it only works when you read it as restatement of Brooks&#x27;s \"tables vs. flowcharts\" line (quoted elsewhere in this thread): it&#x27;s easier to guess what your code is doing from how you organized your data, than it is to guess how you organized your data by looking at the code. I.e. it&#x27;s an advice on where to start understanding someone&#x27;s existing solution; it has nothing to say about solving new problemms &#x2F; writing new code. reply yxhuvud 18 hours agoparentprevBut the distinction is meaningless. A data structure is just a collection of algorithms for working on underlying memory. More complex algorithms are built with simpler algorithms as building blocks. With that in mind, it essentially boils down to picking algorithms which when put together allows solving the problem in an as easy way as possible.Which of course is self evident. Though I suppose it doesn&#x27;t hurt to remind people to step back and look at the full picture. reply e12e 18 hours agorootparentYou need to do data modeling and (de) normalization even if your data is in \"data structures\", not an SQL DBMS. reply gigatexal 18 hours agoparentprevThis point I really resonated with as well.

I&#x27;ve long been a fan of \"table oriented programming\" where the common CRUD objects are specified mostly as data. You could also create them in code by calling a RAM-table constructor, so it&#x27;s not either&#x2F;or. Most the data fields, navigation structure, and event handlers (or handler stubs) could be readily table-ized.Code is a lousy place to store boat-loads of attributes. You can do data-oriented transformations and filters on them if in a data structure. Hierarchical file systems are limiting and messy, because grouping by one factor de-groups another. I want to be able to \"query\" dev code units via SQL or similar. CRUD patterns are pretty consistent across industries such that most CRUD idioms shouldn&#x27;t need custom re-invention, and thus should be attribute-tized.You will still need occasional code-based tweaking, and this can be accomplished by having the attributes generate \"runtime draft\" UI markup and&#x2F;or SQL clauses, which can then be tweaked via code as needed.I&#x27;m building a proof-of-concept that uses what I call \"fractal rendering\" to be able to intercept the \"draft\" construction of screens and SQL clauses at a fine level or course level, depending on need. This avoids the all-or-nothing problem of prior attempts per attribute-vs-code debate. Ya git both! (Dynamic SQL generation should probably be avoided for public-facing sites, per injection risk, but limits the wonderful power of query-by-example.)I don&#x27;t claim it will be as performant as the code-centric approaches, but if it catches on, performance tweakers will find a way to scale it. (For CRUD apps, the performance bottleneck should usually be the database, not app code anyhow, unless you doing something wrong or special.)The CASE tools of the 1980&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s started going in this direction, but were too expensive & clunky, and then the OOP push ended the idea by favoring attributes-in-code, back to square one, sigh. (CASE tools don&#x27;t have to be proprietary.)It&#x27;s ripe area for groundbreaking R&D. CRUD may not be sexy, but it runs the world. reply Swizec 19 hours agoparentprev> Which is why all the LeetCode interviews always struck me as odd90% of leetcode is choosing the right data structure. If your algorithm doesn’t wanna come together, you probably missed a better way to model the data. reply danielmarkbruce 18 hours agorootparentI had a checklist one time for interviews. One of the items was: \"consider data structures x, y, z\" - only maybe 4 or 5 data structures. It worked 95% of the time. reply hdlothia 17 hours agorootparentWhich data structures were those? reply danielmarkbruce 17 hours agorootparentOh, I don&#x27;t have the list I used to use, but it was very basic stuff.hash table, stack, queue, linked list, sorted array, binary tree, graph.Many problems seemed difficult until I just considered shoving the data into one of those. replyepiccoleman 19 hours agoprev> Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don&#x27;t get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)Another point on this, which I really saw in action on a recent project - a \"big\" n is probably much bigger than you think. Sometimes it can be easy to think \"oh, this is going to have to do 100,000 operations, I definitely need to optimize it\" - but computers are fast, and 100,000 multiplications (for example) happens so fast you probably don&#x27;t need to think too hard about it.That&#x27;s not to say you shouldn&#x27;t think at all, just that it&#x27;s often surprising how insanely fast modern computing hardware is. reply kevincox 17 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t know how strongly I agree with this one. Quadratic algorithms are the kind of thing that bite you when you least expect it. I have seen production outages due to accidentally quadratic code and it is also the type of code where some users are suffering with a really slow application because they are frequently experiencing a big N even though 99% of users have a small N all the time. In most cases I would prefer to pick a less than quadratic algorithm even if it is a bit slower for the common case and a bit more complex to implement. Slow common cases get optimized, slow in rare cases often slips by the developers (who don&#x27;t hit those cases) or break in production.Of course this is a tradeoff with Rule 4. If the fancy algorithm is much more complicated I will be more likely to pick the simple one even if it is quadratic and the data has the chance of occasionally being large. But by default I try to stick sub-quadratic if possible.I wrote an article about this relatively recently: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevincox.ca&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;09&#x2F;less-than-quadratic&#x2F; reply lynguist 10 hours agorootparentWe recently had a HN article about it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26296339Some amazing person found that the load time of GTA V Online was awfully slow. It was slow because the developers put in a quadratic function at a time when the iteration object was small. But over time that object grew and so grew the load times quadratically until it was unbearable. And it was unbearable for millions of GTA V Online users.I fully agree that the accidentally quadratic functions will eventually come back to bite you&#x2F;the user. reply mumblemumble 17 hours agoparentprevThe memory hierarchy plays into this, too. A lot of fancy algorithms have poor locality of reference and additional branching, so they tended to work better 40 years ago when CPUs weren&#x27;t that much faster than memory and branch misprediction wasn&#x27;t a thing that people had to worry about on consumer-grade hardware. reply mikhailfranco 17 hours agoparentprevThe canonical reference for this:Scalability!

Given the increase in computer power in the last 20 years I believe bumping that to 100,000 is pretty appropriate. reply wizofaus 15 hours agorootparentAnd yet some of the worst performance issues I&#x27;ve had to deal with were in code typically dealing will merely 100s of items, but using algorithms and slow network-based operations that caused everything to run sluggishly most of the time and not infrequently making the resulting user experience intolerable.I do agree though that a lot of time is wasted on premature or even completely counterproductive optimisations for situations where the data being processed is too small to cause noticeable slowness in processing. reply fasterik 15 hours agoparentprevNot only that, but often our intuitions about what is \"fast\" are wrong if we are basing them on theoretical big-O concerns rather than the specifics of modern hardware. One example that&#x27;s ubiquitous is using a hash table with chaining when a linear array lookup would be faster due to cache locality. reply nine_zeros 18 hours agoparentprevI also keep seeing leetcode interview problems about iterating over a list of 100k items a few times. I can see that it is not optimal but iterating over 100k items is NOTHING compared to the network call you made right after that iteration - in terms of actual production time.And every time I interview, the hiring managers want me but my hiring decision gets vetoed by a leetcode newbie who hasn&#x27;t experienced production scars yet. reply mikhailfranco 17 hours agorootparentSo true. Managers really want to hire architects&#x2F;seniordevs who are experienced, practical, smart and get things done. But if they let the other devs into the interview process they will get vetoes all the way down, because the reports will be:- envious of your amazing pragmatic and effective skills- jealous guarding of the architect promotion that they covet for themselves reply wizofaus 15 hours agorootparentGood managers for dev teams should have enough technical knowledge themselves and demand explanations from participating devs why a candidate is or isn&#x27;t good enough to see through that though.

A lot of programming happens in that space, and in it, the network call is \"free\", but you&#x27;re clogging the thread(s) with actual CPU work. If execution is single-threaded, the problem becomes very relevant, but it applies to multi-threaded async just the same (you might exhaust the pool of workers).Keeping this in mind isn&#x27;t esoteric either, as it applies to JavaScript, Python, Rust, C#, and probably others. reply nine_zeros 17 hours agorootparent> In an async framework of execution, this doesn&#x27;t apply.That&#x27;s right. Async execution prevents the IO from being the bottleneck by offloading it to a different thread.There are 3 situations where this statement falls apart:1. If the execution is single threaded, as you rightly pointed out2. If the response of the async execution matters to the final response of your service. In this case, the primary thread may finish its work but its still waiting for IO to complete. Basically making it synchronous but using async primitives.3. The CPU utilization of iterating over 100k items in a list is negligible compared to the hundreds of daemons and services running on the host. Even a docker container will utilize more CPU than iteration over 100k items.The point is: over-indexing over iteration and time-complexity in interviews is pointless as real systems are going to face challenges far beyond that. reply kagakuninja 17 hours agoparentprevI was testing something, and wanted to add some useless for-loop addition code to simulate \"doing work\". I had to make huge nested loops before I noticed any significant CPU usage on my laptop. reply ska 16 hours agorootparentOptimizing compilers are tricky this way, if you want to do it with optimzations turned on, you usually have to make the work \"real\" in some sense. Sometimes making enough nesting depth that the compiler can&#x27;t fully reason it out works, but usually it&#x27;s easier to modify some memory it can&#x27;t be sure isn&#x27;t touched otherwise (and hence elide or register allocate it or whatever). reply cratermoon 16 hours agorootparentprevWere you using a language where the compiler&#x2F;interpreter was smart enough to optimize out certain kinds of busy loops? It can sometimes take a little extra work to convince the compiler or runtime. In C the keyword &#x27;volatile&#x27; can help. reply ttfkam 19 hours agoprev> Rule 5. Data dominates. If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident.

Using an ORM isn&#x27;t going to create a worse database layout that you could do by hand. The issue is that some&#x2F;many developers don&#x27;t know SQL, nor have the required knowledge of their databases to use an ORM.The ORM requires you to know what lies underneath, it is a fairly leaky abstraction. Understanding that, you can get most ORMs to create nice schemas. reply ttfkam 18 hours agorootparentORMs are typically lowest common denominator for compatibility with many database engines. The best thing you can do is learn about the underlying engine (Postgres, MySQL, MS SQL Server, SQLite, etc.) and its distinct feature set. Once you know that, you will often find yourself quite a ways away from the lowest common denominator.That may be built in temporal table support in MS SQL Server or MariaDB, so you don&#x27;t need explicit audit tables in your schema. Or perhaps timestamp ranges with exclusion constraints in Postgres for enforcing valid schedules without hacks in the app layer.Eventually you notice that you&#x27;re having to define everything twice: once for the DB and again for the ORM definition.This is why I prefer solutions like PostgREST, Postgraphile, and Hasura (for Postgres while other DBs have other similar solutions). Define it once in the DB and just let it bubble up. You may want to expose your storage API through views, but it still ensures optimal data structure at the foundation.DB -> data-generated API service -> client API codegen -> client app such as web or mobile.With a typical ORM, you&#x27;re building from the middle out. It almost always results in a faulty foundation. Pour and set the foundation first.

Typically the larger and more popular ORMs can and do take advantage of database specific features, if you let it.Using the database specific feature will prevent you from using the ORM as an abstraction for replacing you DBMS, but outside open source projects that support SQLite, MariaDB and Postgresql, I&#x27;ve never seen that used in professional settings. One system I&#x27;ve worked with had on paper support for DB2, Sybase and MS SQL. It ran solely on MS SQL, the others had not been tested in years and the developers had pulled in so many MS SQL specific features that it was never going to run on neither DB2 nor Sybase ever again. reply no_wizard 16 hours agorootparentprevThat assumes that you should just expose your Postgres tables as your data.As someone who consumes more APIs than they write nowadays, I appreciate when data is scoped to task[0].

Serious question. The answers I&#x27;ve seen typically stress the advantages for developers who are uncomfortable with SQL (who I think are either going to get comfortable or fail, and the ORM will only delay them getting comfortable or enable them to create a more expensive failure) or more easily generate lots of different complex queries (which sounds plausible, but I&#x27;ve never seen it.) reply mrweasel 16 hours agorootparentThe ORM, in my mind, is just there to help you translate data into objects, that&#x27;s it really. You could do that manually and I have worked on projects where we did just that, but it&#x27;s a lot of repetitive work that brings little value.I have seen and done complex queries using a DSL for an ORM, in my case Django, but now you&#x27;re just learning a different query language, so you&#x27;re right that the ORM doesn&#x27;t bring much to the table. Realistically, those who are uncomfortable with SQL are going to create poor queries with the ORM as well.For quick prototyping and systems with limited amounts of data ORMs can speed up development quite a bit. Technically there&#x27;s a cost, but computers are fast enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter on the small scale. reply dkarl 15 hours agorootparentI guess the way you describe it is the way I like to work, keeping my object model in code close to the relational model to minimize the mental and performance cost of mapping back and forth, and using a SQL library to minimize boilerplate.

This primarily stems from the fact that circumventing potential issues too early leaves them unchallenged, resulting in the next team having to devise expensive solutions to address the unnecessary complexity.The approach that was instilled in me is this: optimizations rely on presumptions, and these presumptions are often incorrect in the beginning.Additionally, I&#x27;ve discovered that managing ego and understanding psychology play crucial roles in dissuading individuals from creating overly complex code. reply vrosas 19 hours agoparentI like to say, “solve problems you have, not problems you think you have.” reply arethuza 19 hours agorootparentYAGNI:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it reply vrosas 15 hours agorootparentSort of, but people get defensive and start to argue that they _will_ need whatever it is at some point.

It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s in a bottleneck or not. Note that this of course assumes that spending 100ns anywhere is actually making the program and user _wait_ 100ns, i.e. it assumes we are cpu bound all the time.For any program that does I&#x2F;O this wouldn&#x27;t be the case. A \"bottleneck\" is going to be a network request, and for much of the programs execution time you can just make the CPU do anything without the user even noticing.So this argument is based on CPU bound interactive programs, which isn&#x27;t all programs. In programs with e.g. IO (which would be most) then rules 1+2 would come along.But I guess the thing is that in an interactive CPU-bound program like a game, there _is_ one single bottleneck and most of the code is on that hot path.

Later, when you do measure and know for a fact what is slow, you still have to make a bet on an approach that will make it faster. The more educated you bet is the better.Good programmers measure, but good programmers have to litterate less because they can predict what will be slow, buggy, use too much memory, and make educated bets in advance, that avouid issues.

I also know it needs to be multithreaded, so thinking up front about how to manage that is a given too.A lot of times, I try to count the zeros. If im doing anything over the network, its going to be miliseconds, but if i do something with memory its going to be nano seconds, so optimize to take remove network requests. If i work on a problem that is multi threaded, i need to conside what can be multi-threaded and what can not. Can i minimize the stuff that cant be multi-threaded, and is there other work to be done while waiting for things that cant be multi-threaded? A lot of times I consider latency vs bandwidth. I know that Latency will always be a harder problem, and a problem hardware has harder time solving, so I try to design for low latency first, and then worry about bandwidth.These are all architectiual decission, that are made early and have a big impact. They are VERY expencive to change, so you want to be as right as you can be the first time. If one part turns out to be slow you can profile and work on it, but changing the struecture of how the program operates and how data is stored and flows is much harder.The author is right, that data structures are the most important tool for optimization. Especially on modern hardware where cache misses are so expencive. The problem is that _everything_ depends on your data structures, so changing them is a lot of work.

I avoided programming because languages like C++ are awful. I could give reasons but people mostly know what they are.

If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.Isn’t this a plug for some sort of object oriented programming? Or at least highly structured programming? Interesting in today’s trendy clime of “objects bad&#x2F;passe, function(al) good.”Having done quite a bit of OOP where “binding behavior to data” is the thing in an ideal laboratory for it (Smalltalk and others), I gained some experience with watching people do this. I observed that there were plenty of good ideas across the industry on how to model data (inheritance, prototype, classification, mixins, mutability,etc), but what I observed is that which data groups together well is very much an art, and that was where people struggle to succeed with the data centric emphasis. The easy objects&#x2F;structs are of course easy, Point, Rect, Person. But as the data got more complex, getting people to come up with good boundaries gets more and complex quickly, and you ended up with really poor object constitutions. Reification is hard. I don’t think it is impossible, I’ve seen people who have a knack for reification come in a refactor an object soup into a cluster of data structures that was beautiful. But yeah, good reification I fear is as much an art as science. reply rstuart4133 13 hours agoparent> Isn’t this a plug for some sort of object oriented programming?No. You see the same thing happen in SQL database design. How you lay out the tables has a profound effect on the final application. Or indeed in database engines. Some use write behind, some write ahead, some log structured. In fact you can often predict how well they will do locking, perform on writes and mass inserts by knowing what datastructure they chose on day 1. Possibly the best examples are in source code control. Git won, yet git has a very ordinary API (command line interface). Git won because Linux used content addressable memory as his underling data structure, and it turned out to be an inspired choice.The other side of the coin is once you&#x27;ve decided on a data structure, it&#x27;s often damned hard to change. Thus one Linus chose CAM, git was going to live or die on that choice. Once there were a few git repo&#x27;s out there, changing it got very hard. Changing the API is not so hard: add a new one, depreciate the old one. reply softfalcon 17 hours agoparentprevI find the statement is true for either object oriented or functional programming.As someone who has done both extensively, I find that the patterns are still applicable to both. The presentation is very different, but still viable. For instance, you might use recursion to traverse data over a for-loop, but that doesn&#x27;t inherently change the concept of a data \"structure\".No matter what, we&#x27;re still speaking in design patterns and if we share that common language, we can apply it to a domain and solve the larger problems of our day-to-day.If you want more examples of this, look up Data Driven Development, but also append Haskell or C++ to your search queries, you&#x27;ll find they repeat the same concepts in two very different \"grammars\"... ahem...

Would you then suggest handling that is \"noise\"?ETA: \"there are countless other [than if err != nil] things one can do with an error value, and application of some of those other things can make your program better, eliminating much of the boilerplate that arises if every error is checked with a rote if statement.\"[2]1 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.utoronto.ca&#x2F;~yuan&#x2F;papers&#x2F;failure_analysis_o...2 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;errors-are-values reply groestl 16 hours agorootparent> Buggy \"edge case handling\" is the source of many critical failures[1]And to fix this, we introduce 10 places per function to improperly unwind the stack, have a chance at missing an error result, and completely ignoring that fact that anything can fail anyway, even a simple addition.

If you don&#x27;t like it, you don&#x27;t have to use the language. Many people choose to use explicit error handling even in languages that support exceptions. Knowing that every function call returns a value that is handled locally makes it a lot easier to reason about your program and debug it.Also, this 75% number sounds made up out of thin air.

You just keep returning the error up the call stack until something handles it at the top, probably by trying again or more likely just logging it. reply AnimalMuppet 15 hours agorootparentprevI recall reading back in the 1970s or 80s that error checking and handling took 80% of the lines of code of production-ready software.

Type system still forces you to explicitly handle the error case, one way or another. reply TeMPOraL 16 hours agorootparentMonadic techniques let you hide most of the noise coming from passing around the Result type, especially in code that would only pass the error state through. You still need to handle the error case explicitly somewhere, but you avoid writing error checks and early returns everywhere else. I say it&#x27;s sweeping under the rug, because you still can&#x27;t exactly ignore the presence of error handling when not interested in it, and the extra complexity cost of monadic mechanisms themselves still pops up elsewhere to ruin your day. reply groestl 16 hours agorootparentprevOr just, like, exceptions, still good enough.

When you use exceptions, you throw type safety out of the window and have an implicit spooky dependency at a distance between one place in the code that throws an exception and another that catches it. reply groestl 16 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s nothing magic-like with exceptions, and no spooky distance. It&#x27;s what it looks like when you _really_ assume everything can fail. Go admits that with panics. reply golergka 16 hours agorootparentOf course there is. If you throw a FileNotFoundError exception from function readFile(), you have to actually read documentation or it&#x27;s source code to know that you have to catch this exception when you use it (in most languages except like early versions of Java). Type system doesn&#x27;t check it for you. And if at some point readFile() also begins throwing InsufficientPermissionError exception, the type system, once again, doesn&#x27;t tell you to fix the code that uses it.If that&#x27;s not the spooky action at a distance between the place where exception is thrown and where it should be handled, I don&#x27;t know what is. reply amalcon 13 hours agorootparent>except like early versions of JavaAnd also more recent versions of Java, such as the current one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;lang&#x2F;Exceptio...>Checked exceptions need to be declared in a method or constructor&#x27;s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary.This is like... the one thing that Java did absolutely right, but for some reason it&#x27;s also the thing people hate most about it?

Like if you have a record parser that invokes a user-defined callback for each record, then you literally can’t type it in such a way as to allow the callback to throw exceptions (that the caller is presumably prepared to handle, having provided the callback in the first place).To be clear, this is not simple. It seems to me like it’ll quickly go into full-blown effect typing territory, which is still not completely solved today and was in an absolutely embryonic state in the early 2000s. reply groestl 9 hours agorootparentprevAside from issues with the type system and composability, it&#x27;s just an impractical idea that stops working smoothly in anything bigger than toy projects.From a caller&#x27;s perspective, \"res, err :=\" and \"throws Exception\" is the same thing: you need to handle the error on site, which (in contrast to the Go gospel), is not a good thing. In the absolute majority of cases it can&#x27;t be done sensibly there, you need to pop it up the stack to a place which has more context. Certainly, it&#x27;s none of a method implementor&#x27;s business to decide \"if a client can reasonably be expected to recover from the error\". You know nothing, Jon Snow.Java has figured out it&#x27;s a bad concept decades ago, but Go is frustratingly re-enacting Java&#x27;s early mistake.

You can often make a very good guess! reply ploxiln 18 hours agoparentYeah I find the first few rules here ... fit for a very different era.Back then, some devs would do something much more complicated to try to be faster, and often the overall program was worse off.Nowadays, some devs do something much more complicated, make the program 100x or 1000x slower than the simple obvious way, and think they&#x27;re doing solid engineering because they&#x27;re definitely not \"prematurely optimizing\", they made it so slow and convoluted that you could never accuse them of that! reply titzer 17 hours agorootparentIn my experience, those 1000x slower situations are because people cobble together things without understanding their underlying performance characteristics, and there&#x27;s usually a bunch of defensive copying and other redundant working going on that just keeps getting compounded. Also, dynamic languages that don&#x27;t have good VMs can end up boxing even the basic numbers in the language, so everything is crazy slow because the very bottom is allocating boxes all the time and hunting for properties in polymorphic objects. In JS, some frameworks are so poorly designed that they abuse objects in ways that make it difficult for the VM to make it fast. So even reasonable-looking code is crazy slow because of hitting hidden slowpaths in the JS implementation.Another thorn is hiding RPCs, DB queries, and other remote operations behind abstraction boundaries. When people think that .getFooBar() is as cheap as a field access, they have a tendency to not cache+pass forward, but just recompute it, which ends up generating a large amount of redundant queries. That will rack up your 1000x&#x27;s pretty quick. reply avg_dev 18 hours agoparentprevwow, I didn&#x27;t get that impression at all. And he clearly does say \"Measure\", not \"shut off your brain\".I would assume that if you measure enough things and code enough you may start to get a feel for what is going to be expensive and what is not. And then - as before - you can continue to measure and iterate.(Also, I think you said \"first people\" when you meant \"first point\") reply IshKebab 17 hours agorootparent> And he clearly does say \"Measure\", not \"shut off your brain\".Yes but he doesn&#x27;t say that if you don&#x27;t measure (which most people won&#x27;t) then you should still engage your brain.That&#x27;s the missing point. Measuring is typically more effort than applying a little brain power and experience. So the choices shouldn&#x27;t be \"measure or nothing\", but that&#x27;s how people always interpret it. reply shadowgovt 16 hours agorootparentThe key thing that drives rule 1 and 2 is the assumption in rule 4: all other things being equal, terser code is easier to work with. The cheapest code to maintain is the code that doesn&#x27;t exist.Therefore, given a choice between writing a little code to make the program work or writing a lot of code to maybe make the program work faster... Write a little code and go back and write the longer code iff it will actually help performance as per measurements. You&#x27;re better off expanding a simple skeleton than moving bones around in an already-complex assembly. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparentYes but for the 100th time, you don&#x27;t get to just ignore performed because you haven&#x27;t measured it.The fact that so many replies are not getting this goes to show how misleading this advice is. reply cowl 13 hours agoparentprevyou actually can&#x27;t though.Forget everything you have learned about the famous BigO analysis for 99% of the cases because it assumes a computing model that is no where near what we have today. It was close in the 80-s but now it&#x27;s totally wrong.the most glaring example i can offer is that nowdays for example a datastructure based on a linked list will almost always be slower than one based on arrays even though the BigO analyses says otherwise.CPU cache plays a much bigger role and it pays more to chase a consistent cache access rather than jumping all over through pointers and thrasshing the cache.likewise most algorithms would be faster looping through all array items rather than for example using a set or hashMap when number of items is small (and by small we are still talking about hundreds of elements, the exact number when one datastructure becomes better than the other will depend on many factors.that&#x27;s why, don&#x27;t assume but measure, it&#x27;s the best advice there is. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparent> you actually can&#x27;t though.Well, yes I can because I know everything you just said already...> a datastructure based on a linked list will almost always be slower than one based on arrays even though the BigO analyses says otherwise.Cache locality is one reason that linked lists are usually slower, but I think you&#x27;ve got a bit mixed up because the big O analysis also says they&#x27;ll be slower (in most common cases).> that&#x27;s why, don&#x27;t assume but measure, it&#x27;s the best advice there is.You missed my point (thus proving why this is misleading advice!) reply mcphage 18 hours agoparentprev> Sure you can&#x27;t know which bits of a program are going to be slow without measuring, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you have no clue at all. You can often make a very good guess!You can make a good guess! Just, measure it to be sure before you start optimizing. reply IshKebab 17 hours agorootparentNo, that&#x27;s my point! Measuring is good, but some things are obviously slower.For example preallocating arrays. You don&#x27;t need a benchmark to tell you it will be faster because it literally can&#x27;t not be.Another example from my recent real life: I changed a data structure from a hashmap to an array with integer keys. I didn&#x27;t profile it because can&#x27;t not be faster. And I knew it needed to be fast because it is called for every branch in my program. reply shadowgovt 10 hours agorootparent> For example preallocating arrays. You don&#x27;t need a benchmark to tell you it will be faster because it literally can&#x27;t not be.This assertion is false for JavaScript arrays in the v8 engine in some contexts. Preallocation of a JS array causes the engine to make a heterogeneous array, which is more expensive because it&#x27;s an object under-the-hood. Allocating the array using repeated `push` calls of homogeneous data lets the engine know it&#x27;s a homogeneous-type array, which is an \"exotic object\" that can use more optimal representations under-the-hood.

      "Rob Pike, a renowned programmer, outlines five notable rules for software development that emphasize simplicity and discourage premature optimization.",
      "The rules incorporate using straightforward algorithms and data structures to reduce bugs and ease implementation, focusing on data structures due to their crucial role in programming.",
      "Pike also urges not to predict where a program will expend most of its time, thus avoiding early optimization, and underscores the necessity of measuring before opting for speed tuning."

      "The Hacker News discussion highlighted Rob Pike's 1989 programming rules, with a primary focus on the significance of data structures over algorithms for optimizing code.",
      "Participants criticized the current interviewing trend that concentrates mainly on algorithms, arguing it fails to reflect real-world programming tasks. They advocated for efficient use and understanding of data structures, which can make algorithms more evident.",
      "Other debated topics included performance optimization, error handling strategies, usage of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), SQL knowledge, and the concept of waste in programming. Suggestions were made to measure before optimizing and consider hardware limitations before implementing theoretically fast solutions."

Happy to answer any questions or provide further info here. reply reactordev 17 hours agorootparentWhy such a low rate? reply cdolan 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d be curious to hear your benchmarks that give you the impression this is a low rate.When accounting for total compensation including base salary, benefits, bonuses, 401k programs, time off, and non-monetary benefits like a clean codebase and positive team, we find our total package exceeds most&#x2F;all comparable offerings on the market (such as those seen on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;larajobs.com&#x2F;) reply SteveNuts 15 hours agorootparentZiprecruiter gives $131,390 national average for \"Senior PHP developer salary\"Glassdoor gives $135,000 average for \"Senior PHP Developer\"My experience: The lowest I&#x27;ve seen for a Sr. Dev in my area is $120k base salary.However, this looks like a fullstack engineer since you mention frontend components so that may mean even more.It&#x27;s fine to set the pay at whatever you want, but it&#x27;s objectively low for the role. If you have calculations on what the overall comp would be that would probably help. reply el_benhameen 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you benchmark based on other posts on this month’s “Who is Hiring” thread, I currently see two other roles with a low bound at or below $100k. Both have upper bounds much higher than $100k, though. If we assume that most other posters here will have similar PTO&#x2F;benefits policies, then $100k is on the very low end unless the bonus component is very large. (I have no dog in this fight but thought it was an interesting question.) reply brandonmenc 15 hours agorootparentprev> non-monetary benefits like a clean codebase“We’re going to pay you less because our code is clean” seems... odd. reply angoragoats 13 hours agorootparentprevComparing to Larajobs is comparing yourself to a very narrow slice of the job market which (admittedly based on my limited understanding) is populated by a larger-than-average number of offshore contractors. This likely skews the average compensation package lower compared to other types of roles.Based on your description, this role seems to be more of a Senior Full Stack Engineer, a title with significantly more responsibility than \"Laravel Developer.\"Until your clean codebase and positive team can pay my mortgage or other bills, I will not factor them into compensation comparisons.The national average for a senior full stack engineer, according to Glassdoor, is $160k. You could probably argue that Pittsburgh is a lower-cost area than average, but I still think you&#x27;re 10-20k low in base salary alone, at bare minimum. reply reactordev 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you find your package compelling, that’s all that matters really. reply Implicated 11 hours agorootparentprevHey Charlie - I reached out on Twitter as I tend to not keep up with comment chains very well here and you don&#x27;t have any alternative contact methods on your HN profile. reply mgkimsal 13 hours agorootparentprevAre you open to part-time&#x2F;contract folks instead of full-time? reply guinness74 8 hours agorootparentprevIs there equity available? reply danieloneel 10 hours agoprevLayerSan Francisco Bay AreaFull-TimeFounding engineerWe’re building SMB accounting software API-first so that it can be integrated directly into software platforms where business owners already work.

Over time, they increased the base speed they offer to 20, 25, 50, and now 75. They have done this because they want to have x% of their customers on \"broadband\", per the federal definition.This is all well and good, but they keep increasing the price, and refuse to offer lower-tier service. I probably wouldn&#x27;t want 12Mbps anymore, but 20 or 25 would suffice. I wish I could pay a fraction of what I&#x27;m paying for 75Mbps and get a lower tier of service. It should suffice that x% of customers are offered \"broadband\" for a reasonable price, even if some choose a lower speed.Ultimately, this comes down to competition. There are no other wired options where I live (in the heart of Silicon Valley). I have considered using a cellular hotspot, but it&#x27;s not competitive in terms of pricing.I&#x27;m all for prodding companies to move to faster speeds, but there should still be room for consumer choice. reply mixdup 13 hours agoparent>This is all well and good, but they keep increasing the price, and refuse to offer lower-tier service.

It should suffice that x% of customers are offered \"broadband\" for a reasonable price, even if some choose a lower speed.The problem is that most of the costs of providing broadband are fixed costs. To run a coaxial cable from their headend to your house, and to provide employees and crews to repair it and install it all costs the same whether you buy 10 megabits or 2 gigabitsThe variable costs--things like backbone bandwidth, paying for transit, doing node splits, etc are a smaller part of the overall cost than you might expectThis lower end of the market, though, is being taken up by Fixed Wireless (T-Mobile and Verizon primarily) for example you can get Verizon home wireless internet for as low as $25. My mom has it, and it&#x27;s decent 50 megabit service for a low price reply PaulHoule 12 hours agorootparentThere also is a step between DSL and cable and fiber. I have a fiber to the node situation that gives consistent and reliable 20 Mbps down and I have two of those with load balancer. With VDSL they could sell 100Mbps service to a few houses close to the node.A real upgrade for me would involve running a cable through a beaver meadow. There is an electric line and crews do go in there to limb up trees and they are planning to replace a pole, if there was some rational coordination of services and a commitment to universal service they’d get the fiber in when they do a maintenance cycle on the power line. reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentI mean, the beavers would probably also appreciate an upgrade. reply bonyt 11 hours agorootparentprev> The problem is that most of the costs of providing broadband are fixed costs. To run a coaxial cable from their headend to your house, and to provide employees and crews to repair it and install it all costs the same whether you buy 10 megabits or 2 gigabitsNot sure if this is completely the case when it comes to older networks that might need upgrades because lots of folk are sharing the same coax line. In an HFC[1] network, bandwidth is shared on the coax branches, and a variable number of units can be sharing the same fiber link, which can serve a neighborhood, block, or even unit. And, so upgrades can make a network more \"fiber-rich.\"[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hybrid_fiber-coaxial reply lyu07282 12 hours agorootparentprevThe actual problem is that this is infrastructure owned by a private, international for-profit corporation. Of course it&#x27;s a fixed cost and a limited number of profitable customers (get fucked if you live anywhere that isn&#x27;t profitable), yet your profits need to go up forever. I&#x27;m always curious because most people intuitively understand why for example it makes no sense to privatize streets and roads, there is only one going to your home. Even most people who have faith in capitalism, understand how monopolies are bad for society, privatized infrastructure is one of the more obvious contradictions of liberalism. reply landemva 7 hours agorootparent> it makes no sense to privatize streets and roads, there is only one going to your home.Where I live roads are private (part of the lot) with reciprocal easement to all other lot owners to travel on the easement. It&#x27;s not a toll and it&#x27;s not &#x27;public&#x27; or &#x27;government&#x27;. No worries about government making crazy rules on their roads, when we own it.Closer to topic, I want to get neighbors and everyone onboard with installing fiber in road and leasing to ISPs. Way too many hassles, so we remain dependent on Comcast. reply gnicholas 12 hours agorootparentprev> you can get Verizon home wireless internet for as low as $25.I hope this leads to wired ISP price reductions, or at least slower price growth. I happen to live in a VZW dead zone, so unfortunately it won&#x27;t work for me... reply ZoomerCretin 11 hours agorootparentprevThe UK fixes this by forcing the companies who own the lines to rent and share them with other providers. ISPs in the US vehemently oppose this, of course. reply gnicholas 10 hours agorootparent> ISPs in the US vehemently oppose this, of course.But is it still required though? Isn&#x27;t this how Sonic uses AT&T lines? Perhaps it only applies to DSL, which is basically obsolete now? reply cereal_cable 5 hours agorootparentThis happened with copper lines for telephony providers. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers have to provide access for Competitive Local Exchange Carriers to enter the market and break up their monopoly. This effectively made DSL and T1s available via CLECs as they could acquire access to a copper circuit directly.Internet has yet to be regulated that way and fiber lines aren&#x27;t considered the same as those copper lines.Also, fiber to the home is done using most often a PON system purchased from a specific vendor and is a time shared medium. You might only get 1Gbps service but you also aren&#x27;t getting 100% of the fiber to yourself. The home side device will filter information from your neighbors for instance.There&#x27;s always ways to do this of course but, it wouldn&#x27;t be as straightforward as patch the fiber from your home in the same way that they did with copper lines. reply Workaccount2 13 hours agoparentprevIn an extreme ironic twist, me, the techie nerd guy, has the slowest internet of the regular-folk friend group of mine. Everyone has got 1Gbps and here I am with 300Mbps. reply vladslav 13 hours agorootparentMy friends in third-world countries get faster and less expensive service than me in Silicon Valley. On top of that, there is no fiber connection in my neighborhood, and they&#x27;ve been on fiber for over 5 years. And there is a data cap also. It&#x27;s just crazy and sad. reply arllk 12 hours agorootparentI live in Perú, and I have 400Mbps internet FTTH with no data cap, and the price is 37 USD [1], the competition of the internet providers is incredibly good for the consumers.The lowest plan that mi ISP offers is 100Mbps and is at 21 USD.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.movistar.com.pe&#x2F;hogar&#x2F;internet&#x2F;solo-internet (Link in Spanish) reply vondur 12 hours agorootparentAccording to wikipedia the average monthly salary in Peru is $502 US. $37 per month doesn&#x27;t seem that cheap to me. reply nicoburns 12 hours agorootparentAs another point of comparison, a new ISP in my area of London is offering symmetric gigabit fiber for £25&#x2F;month or around $30&#x2F;month (USD). reply vondur 11 hours agorootparent$30&#x2F;month USD compared to the average salary in London is pretty good. We unfortunately don&#x27;t have much competition among ISP&#x27;s here in the US. reply ZoomerCretin 11 hours agorootparentprevYour country requires ISPs to share and rent lines. That does a great deal for competition and lowering prices reply robertlagrant 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you develop later you can leapfrog countries that ground through all the necessary phases for the development to happen for everyone globally. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you can keep pace. Hopefully your area gets an upgrade, or a Starlink, soon. reply Fatnino 12 hours agorootparentprevPalo Alto just unveiled another fiber to the home plan to be ready by Jan 2025 in one select neighborhood (that I live just outside of, dammit).This plan will definitely come to fruition just like all the other ones since the 90s reply msmith 12 hours agorootparentIt boggles my mind that Google Fiber has been available in Austin, TX for 10 years but is still not available in the communities next door to Google HQ. reply toast0 9 hours agorootparentGoogle announced they would bring service to San Jose, along with about 20? other locations, and then later in the week, AT&T announced they would bring fiber to the listed communities in their ILEC territory and a couple more for good measure. And then a few months later, AT&T started rolling it out. Google hadn&#x27;t figured out how to access poles or where they wanted equipment by the time AT&T was offering service, so they gave up. They did get some new service areas through aquisition, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve announced any new construction service areas in a very long time now. reply ZoomerCretin 11 hours agorootparentprevProbably due to the extreme level of veto-ism in the Bay Area. Everyone wants internet, but if 5 people complaining about yards or roads being dug up can get work to stop indefinitely, costs are going through the roof. There&#x27;s far more uncertainty in that political environment than anywhere else.For reference, I live in a small town of ~6,000 people, and we&#x27;re getting fiber laid. For the longest time we only had 25mbps, and then a new provider came in with coaxial and offered 200mbps (with a data cap), and now a third is laying fiber.Our average income is $34k&#x2F;year, so it&#x27;s not because we have more money than the opulent Bay Area. reply Fnoord 13 hours agorootparentprevCheck this out:> Broadband penetration as of June 2017: 23.5 broadband connections for every 100 people. > Distribution of broadband connections by type, as reported by Ancom, is as follows 94% FTTx (FTTH&#x2F;FTTB&#x2F;FTTC&#x2F;FTTN) internet access connections, 4.8% Coaxial cable, 0.2% other.Now guess the country. Answer in ROT13 at [1]. Hint: it ain&#x27;t a first world country. Another hint: Latine loquitur. Oh and it ain&#x27;t a recent development either. They&#x27;ve been at it like forever.[1] uggcf:&#x2F;&#x2F;ra.jvxvcrqvn.bet&#x2F;jvxv&#x2F;Vagrearg_va_Ebznavn reply gnicholas 13 hours agorootparentprevAre they in geographic region that is more densely populated? Or an area that was built out more recently? In my last house (also in SV) the choices were between Comcast and AT&T copper. The latter went up to 6&#x2F;1, so was effectively useless. I&#x27;m sure it was laid down decades ago. reply vladslav 12 hours agorootparentThey are in a densely populated area. The city had issues with internet service for quite a while. The government started to invest heavily in fiber tech around the 2010s, and fast forward to now, almost everyone in the city can get a fiber connection to their home or apartment building. The cost is around ~28$ for 300Mbs and $80 for 1Gbs. reply thumbsup-_- 13 hours agorootparentprevYes. Providers in India offer far more speed at far cheaper prices than US. The key to this is competition. There are many providers available in each major city which helps consumer. It&#x27;s sad that in many US&#x27; major cities there is usually one or two providers only for a building or neighborhood. My building in SF only has comcast, so they have a monopoly and can charge whatever they want. reply Fatnino 12 hours agorootparentprevMuch of residential silicon valley was built very quickly in the 50s reply ClumsyPilot 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can find fiber connection in some remote vilage in slovakia.Consolidation is the cause - US had 2-se as many listed companies 30 yeats ago.Now US capital is buying up independant businesses across easterm Europe and developing countries, killing competition and the local economy. reply 867-5309 12 hours agorootparentprev\"faster\" here is relative. unless you live in eastern USA or western Europe, you&#x27;d be lucky to see half the quoted \"speed\", since that is where the majority of the internet resides reply isilofi 12 hours agorootparentprevNon-techie notices \"internet is slow\" because their youtube video is blocky or pages load slowly. Non-techie goes to ISP to complain. ISP upsells to a more expensive plan.The actual reason in almost all cases: non-techies are clueless about their slow and shitty WIFI. Picking empty or less busy channels, using 5GHz, using gasp cables, all black magic and never done.Sometimes the upselling actually helps because the better plan comes with a maybe-better AP... reply lifeisstillgood 12 hours agorootparentI live with the shitty wifi because the yak-shaving that comes with \"ok, I will set their router to be pass through, now I need to install openwrt on that 100$ recommended router, and run a cable behind my drywall upto the second floor, and install anothe openwrt and bang goes a weekend and really I am only do that once I order a second line because taking out my family&#x27;s internet for the whole weekend because I will fuck it up at least once ..ok.Next month honest reply gosub100 12 hours agorootparentprev> their slow and shitty WIFII&#x27;m still embarrassed about the time I called my ISP and complained that the new Xmbs package they just installed is capped at only Ymbps only to realize I had run the speed test over wifi (back in the wireless-g,maybe n days)... reply gnicholas 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the Comcast sales reps spin ridiculous tales about how much speed you need. People who don&#x27;t know better are fooled by this, and end up paying way too much for speeds they don&#x27;t remotely need. reply doubled112 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd some techies regret our choice to have both a Mikrotik AP and walls. You can have decent WiFi and one of those, but not all three.That&#x27;ll teach me to stay consistent. reply warner25 12 hours agorootparentprevMe too. I tell everyone who will listen that they should look at their actual bandwidth usage. I&#x27;ve looked at the detailed statistics on my Google Nest WiFi router, and my family&#x27;s peak usage never exceeded about 30 Mbps. That&#x27;s with me working from home as a CS PhD student and my wife homeschooling our kids during the day. I have 300 Mbps (down) because that&#x27;s the lowest, cheapest tier that my ISP offers.Maybe people are actually using their 1 Gbps bandwidth if they have multiple 4K TVs and do serious gaming? I don&#x27;t know, I doubt it.I tell everyone to look at their actual cellular data usage too. I think all middle class Americans just buy unlimited plans now, but I do just fine with 500 MB per month for $5. reply joe5150 12 hours agorootparentNetflix 4K streams seem to top out around 25Mbps and I&#x27;d guess other services are comparable, so 1Gbps is still a lot of bandwidth for even large multi-streamer households. I think a lot of families will reach the limits of cheap, basic wifi routers before they start actually pushing against their bandwidth caps in these situations.My issue in the past with cable gigabit service was the relatively tiny upstream bandwidth of 20-50Mbps. This made for some challenges a few years ago when suddenly everybody in the house was on Zoom all day long. reply warner25 12 hours agorootparentI strongly agree about upload bandwidth. In previous homes I&#x27;ve chosen higher tiers of service for exactly that reason. I think I could live happily with 20 or even 10 Mpbs down, but not 1 Mbps up when I&#x27;m using cloud storage for photos and need to be on some video calls. I shouldn&#x27;t need to pay for an order-of-magnitude more download bandwidth to get reasonable upload bandwidth, but apparently I do. reply bdavbdav 12 hours agorootparentprevYep. We don’t need the gigabit down, we need the 100 up that comes with it. Openreach seem to sell about 10% of the download as the upload. reply hn_acker 11 hours agorootparentprev> Me too.

Moreover, in the long term, transitioning to fiber would be less expensive to the big ISPs like Comcast [4], but Comcast keeps raising prices on broadband over decades-old copper wires and committing subsidy fraud [5].

With 70% of households signing up, that produces a certain cost. Now imagine there was a second fiber network that also cost $2000 per household that splits the customer base. By definition, this is going to be more expensive.Capitalism created this problem. It won&#x27;t solve it. This is capitalism working as intended: doing the absolute least possible for the highest possible price while lobbying to exclude competition (eg by making municipal broadband illegal).Expecting markets to solve this problem is neoliberal brain rot.

I barely even got it back when my kid stole my credit card and gave it to a scammer selling \"minecraft accounts.\"Maybe I need to find a different bank? reply joemi 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not how chargebacks work at all in my experience, from the point of view of the company getting charged-back. I worked for a indie small retail store that also sells online, and I was the guy the owner would give the chargeback notices to and was told to \"figure it out\". No matter whether a chargeback for an in-store charge or an online order, the credit card company never once granted it the store&#x27;s favor in all the times I tried. Further they require a lot of proof, more proof than we could actually provide. For weborders, simply showing them the weborder and the tracking info was not enough. They needed _proof_ that what was ordered was what was sent, which we couldn&#x27;t provide because we weren&#x27;t taking photos&#x2F;video of us packing the products. For chargebacks on in-store purchases, it was just as burdensome to present proof. I even had one time when the customer emailed saying she did a chargeback by accident, and I provided that email and what records of the sale I had from the POS system, and the chargeback still went through.(Also, a bit of a side-point: The chargeback notices always had a VERY short window during which you were allowed to contest them.

So, say the 50th percentile customer pays for 100M, they actually got 102M, boom, that metric is met. However easily 25%+ of customers didn&#x27;t get their rated speeds during that peak period.Some people ranting on an internet forum isn&#x27;t high quality data of overall network metrics.For a lot of residential customers, once latency is good enough it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Once you get down below like 30 or so milliseconds, a lot of consumer applications just won&#x27;t be any different. I could have 80ms latency to HN and my experience of the site would be roughly the same. Not saying all residential applications don&#x27;t care about latencyUpload speed is just a cash grab.No.This lacks all historical and practical understanding of why upload speeds are limited.Back in the 70s&#x2F;80s when coax was being planned and rolled out for cable, they needed to figure out what frequencies they would use. Cable providers knew they needs a ton in one direction and only a tiny bit for things like buying pay per view in the other.This has been fine traditionally because even up to Netflix and streaming we haven’t needed the upload at residential. No one complained. That may start to change a little.As far as I am aware, all DOCSIS (cable) providers in the USA that are using cable-tv coax are limited to a max of 35Mbps upto DOCSIS3.1.I am writing this on 1250&#x2F;35 right now. The local tiers for me are 100&#x2F;15, 400&#x2F;25, 1000&#x2F;35, 1250&#x2F;35.It isn’t a “cash grab” at all. If you need more upload you need a new line that isn’t divided so asymmetrically, which means fiber. And once you fiber, there is zero reason to go go symmetric, as you have two lines with the same equipment on either side, to a point where the ISP will charge differently if you cut into their bandwidth too much. reply hn_acker 11 hours agorootparent> It isn’t a “cash grab” at all.

For example, on Comcast I get 800 &#x2F; 20, but there&#x27;s also a 400 &#x2F; 10 tier (and maybe a low-cost tier below that?). If everyone was getting 20 up, maybe I&#x27;ll get upgraded to 40 Mbps. reply jwells89 13 hours agoparentUpload being low is frustrating. In my area Comcast sells “gigabit” service that’s 1000Mbps&#x2F;20Mbps which seems like it’s explicitly designed to hook less technically aware customers who know “gigabit” is good but not exactly how.Thankfully there are alternative ISPs here that sell symmetrical gigabit, but that’s definitely not the case everywhere. reply bscphil 13 hours agorootparentIn my case Comcast is 800&#x2F;20 or 1000&#x2F;35, but they refuse to even advertise the upload rate so you don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;re signing up.

I am extremely glad that starlink exists, and I&#x27;m willing to pay double for starlink that I would pay for a connection limited to 12 Mbps down reply jupp0r 13 hours agoparentprevAgreed. ISPs can allocate bandwidth on DSL&#x2F;Coax trunks as they please so it should just be a configuration change to increase the upload percentage. reply toast0 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not really true. There&#x27;s certainly knobs to turn, and almost certainly some available capacity to increase uploads, but coax and dsl are fundamentally asynchronous.Coax has to manage the single (or few) headend transmitter vs many CPE transmitters, you get better multiplexing to the CPE than from the CPE; and while the newest equipment may be able to handle CPE uploads across most of the spectrum, older equipment had a narrower range of frequencies available to upload with. If there&#x27;s spare frequencies and downstream capacity isn&#x27;t using it, then yeah... if not, there&#x27;s trade offs.For DSL, everybody has a dedicated pair to the DSLAM&#x2F;remote terminal whatever, but crosstalk between pairs impacts the signals and again, the DSLAM has more ability to mitigate that towards the CPE than the CPE can when sending upstream. Anyway, VDSL&#x2F;VDSL2 are specified with asymetric up and down bandwidth, as was ADSL. Of course, DSL ISPs tend to cap sync rates based on profiles, rather than running the lines to their maximum capacity, so a lot of lines do have more upload capacity than is allowed to be used, and to the extent that&#x27;s the case, it would just take a profile update to get more upload for many users. reply jupp0r 8 hours agorootparentThanks for the detailed overview.

I wish there were more metered options available for data, especially for wireless options. I&#x27;d love to see an offering that has a low monthly connection fee (i.e. $1-5), along with a sensible price per GB option (i.e. double the cost of transit so there are decent margins on this, but isn&#x27;t something crazy like $10&#x2F;gb).Assuming that for most consumers the end price averages to be the same, the benefit of metered is it puts an incentive on the data provider to make their speeds as high as possible. Higher speeds will result in more bandwidth usage (i.e. Youtube&#x2F;Netflix will default to a higher data rate), which will result in more profit for the company. The desires of the customer and the desires of the provider are the same - faster and more stable internet leads to better customer experience and more profit.One of the issues I see with fixed-speed-unlimited-data options is that providers are incentivized to oversell the fixed speed bandwidth, leading to \"up to 100mbps\" type connections where it&#x27;s a theoretical max, not the average. Under this model the desires of the customer are misaligned with the desires of the provider. The provider wants the customer to use as little data as possible - the less they use the more they can sell plans on the same infrastructure. This can be addressed with rules and regulations, but I prefer a situation where I know both the customer and provider have aligned desires. reply ftth_finland 12 hours agorootparentIt makes no sense to price wireless data based on IP transit costs.IP transit costs per GB are a fraction of a hundredth of a penny.It barely makes any sense to bill consumers per GB on any terrestrial network.In Northern Europe a typical 4G SIM with a monthly data quota is $9 per month. An unlimited 4G SIM with all you can eat data is $18. How many price points do you need in between?Heck, international 4G&#x2F;5G data roaming fees are capped at $2&#x2F;GB and by 2027 the cap will be $1&#x2F;GB. reply elzbardico 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, metering is the rational thing to do.But caps are different and don&#x27;t work the same. reply musha68k 12 hours agorootparentprevThe metered pricing model doesn’t align with reality of data costs for ISPs which are often negligible (thanks to technological advances and peering agreements especially).

Yes, some network congestion arguments have prevailed with wireless broadband because of the atmospherical and technical limitations of the medium. However, congestion is not as consequential for fixed broadband. Broadband providers reason that instead of limiting these internet “super-users” (which would be discriminatory and litigated accordingly), they need to implement data caps for all consumers, which they claim is fair and unbiased. However, scarcity is not a reality for broadband providers, even with super-users. Internet functions by “statistical multiplexing” meaning that bandwidth is dynamically allocated and reused without a limit “[u]nlike other utilities such as water, electricity, gas or oil.”> This means that no super-user is consuming bandwidth at the expense of other users; you’re not going to receive less internet because your neighbor runs a Twitch channel, for example. Rather, super-users are simply using more internet more often, and the “super-user discount” (the fact that broadband providers aren’t able to charge them, specifically, for this “above normal” usage) angers providers more than anything else. This brings us to the real reason broadband providers apply data caps to consumers: money. Applying data caps to all of us, therefore, enables broadband providers to pat themselves on the back for devising clever “overage” fees.As time goes on the same will become true for the majority of wireless usage, if it isn&#x27;t true already.Sending twice the data at a time doesn&#x27;t cost the ISP twice the money.

The vast majority of consumers still get internet via coax cables, and bandwidth is very much an issue on those. reply derefr 13 hours agorootparentNo, a very small part of the last mile is connected by fiber. Trunking is always fiber these days. As are local neighbourhood branch points, if your provider evolved from a telephone company. (If you live in an apartment building served by an ex-telephone ISP, you likely have fiber run all the way to the network closet of your building, with only the per-subscriber in-wall wiring switching over to copper.)ISPs that evolved from cable companies might still be using cable hubs with a common collision domain, but only a relatively small number of subscribers will be riding the same copper — it’s just cheaper these days to convert the signal to fiber as early in the signal path as possible. Plastic wires are cheaper than metal wires, and you need fewer of them (and so fewer switches.) reply IntelMiner 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, *fiber* can. But the majority of Americans use Cable&#x2F;HFC (DOCSIS) technologies. These were designed as a one-to-many closed loop TV broadcast on a coax line. Except with the incoming DOCSIS 4.0 deployments it&#x27;s always been asymmetric as a limitation of the technology reply 0x0000000 13 hours agorootparentprevFiber is not ubiquitous. Many of us are still on DOCSIS over copper, in which case the person you are replying to is exactly correct: upload speed can be reduced for additional download speed. reply aaronax 12 hours agorootparentprevThough the fiber system as a whole may not be capable of symmetry. For example GPON with 2.5gbps&#x2F;1.25gbps up&#x2F;down and 10G-PON at 10&#x2F;2.5 up&#x2F;down. reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparentprevTrue FTTH is naturally symmetric; PON is not nor is Cable. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, I think you might be confused. We all know that the fiber for the download link is at least 10x wider than the fiber for the upload channel. There&#x27;s just no way to squeeze the same number of bits through the smaller \"tube\" &#x2F;s reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparentprevAssuming we are talking about Cable internet: If they were starting from scratch all possibilities are equally expensive, but they have installed equipment in your neighborhood which assumes a specific channel allocation.They have increased the channel allocation for upstream in recent years and DOCSIS 4.0 allows symmetric connections, but the demand is for downstream, and the fewer channels they allocate to upstream the bigger number they can advertise. reply epx 13 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK, PON (Passive Optical Network) has inherent reasons to be asymetric reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentNot really. I&#x27;m sure asymmetric PON is cheaper but there are plenty of symmetric EPON modes. reply godzillabrennus 13 hours agorootparentprevMy assumption is torrents are a threat to streaming services already and potentially a death blow if uplink speeds are too fast. reply RajT88 13 hours agorootparentWhen I worked at a small ISP, this was indeed a threat. We offered symmetric speeds though and dealt with it via traffic shaping.It really was just the odd teenager torrenting here and there. reply hhh 13 hours agorootparentprevwhy would uplink speeds being fast contribute to torrents outside of the first few seeders?... you would just have more peers contributing smaller amounts reply callalex 13 hours agorootparentprevAlso new media (streamers and tubers) rely on uploads and are eating cable’s lunch. It’s just extortion through monopoly. reply seany 10 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the layer 1 medium. In a shared RF environment (dialup, cable, wifi, p2p RF) you normally have a shared bandwidth space. This is typically \"channelized\" and you can pick how many channels you want for \"up\" and how many for \"down\". This isn&#x27;t normally dynamic, it needs to be fixed by the standard or at the very least by the head end equipment. It&#x27;s more expensive in the above RF spaces because cabling is expensive the more home runs you want to do. With fiber it&#x27;s a little easier, 1:32 pon splits still give a _lot_ of bandwidth for upstream because it&#x27;s easier to isolate the adjacent wavelengths (you can pack them in tighter), and the normal noise floor is lower. With 1:1 fiber DIA it&#x27;s a total non issue and you can do what ever is the limit of the noise of the fiber and the limits of the transceivers (typically optical packages in sfp&#x2F;sfp+ packaging these days) reply RajT88 13 hours agorootparentprevAsymmetric speeds let ISP&#x27;s oversell their network (more). reply IdiranVibe 13 hours agoparentprevIt blows my mind that you guys in the US still have to deal with data caps ... It&#x27;s been years in the UK since that&#x27;s been a thing for broadband, and we&#x27;re close to the point where mobile data will be the same reply adrr 13 hours agorootparentOnly data caps if you only have one choice in broad band. Once you have two or more, data caps go away and price is cut in half. If there are no competitors, the provider will milk the customers of cash. reply IdiranVibe 11 hours agorootparentI suppose at that point it&#x27;s a geography issue which is less of a problem here due to the size of the country reply criddell 13 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on your ISP. My phone has a data cap of 100 GB&#x2F;month. Once I go over that I am throttled when the network is congested.My home internet has no data caps. reply thayne 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about other ISPs, but Xfinity&#x2F;Comcast residential internet has a data cap of 1TB&#x2F;month, regardless of the bandwidth tier you pay for. Although you can pay a (substantial) fee to remove that data cap. reply SoylentYellow 12 hours agorootparentRemoving the Xfinity data cap would increase my bill by 60%. It is outrageous. reply mjrpes 12 hours agorootparentprevComcast Business has no data cap and so might be an option reply ls612 13 hours agorootparentprevFor residential internet most people have no data cap and those who do have a very large cap (over 1TB&#x2F;month). Even I as a pretty active user only use like 500GB&#x2F;month on my desktop according to Windows. reply callalex 13 hours agorootparent1TB&#x2F;mo is not “very large” since you can get that kind of data allocation on a $2-4&#x2F;mo server. reply vel0city 12 hours agorootparentResidential internet connections aren&#x27;t designed for the same kind of usage as some VPS. reply callalex 12 hours agorootparentOk but we’re talking about a whole computer with redundant power and connectivity and memory and disk storage compared to throughput on already-installed non-redundant wires. One of those certainly costs way less than the other, but Comcast still charges multiple orders of magnitude more for. reply vel0city 11 hours agorootparentIts not a whole computer, its a tiny fraction of a whole computer. And that whole computer is in a giant datacenter hundreds of feet from massive ISP interconnections and only a few hops of hardware away from it. Meanwhile the residential customer is probably many miles from the nearest interchange, often even hundreds or more miles.Location, location, location.I do agree the over the cap costs imposed by residential ISPs are many, many multiples of their true cost, but they&#x27;re mostly there to discourage use not be a reasonable price. If you want business level usage hop on their business networking where pricing models are more designed for more average load. replykstrauser 12 hours agoparentprevI wish ISPs were required to advertise the number of seconds you&#x27;re allowed to use their service at full speed. Ooh, a gigabit pipe with a terabyte cap? You&#x27;re allowed to use it for 3 hours per month before throttling or extra charges kick in.I believe it&#x27;s false advertising when ISPs claim their price is $X per month if it&#x27;s only for 1&#x2F;240th of a month. I understand and support the idea of overprovisioning, but a 240x ratio is insanity. reply phantom784 14 hours agoparentprevOr at least require that uncapped tiers be available. reply callalex 13 hours agoparentprevThey should also require the ISP to use a reasonable method to count the amount of data if there is a data cap. No matter how I count the data in and out of my gateway running OpenWRT, Comcast&#x2F;Xfinity consistently counts and charges me for at least 20% more data with no discernible reason why.I think somewhere in fine print they claim they get to round up to the nearest KB or MB every minute or some asinine made-up scale that only benefits them. reply staringback 14 hours agoparentprevSo that someone&#x27;s grandma who hardly uses her connection can subsidize your extreme over-consumption of digital media? reply voakbasda 14 hours agorootparentYes, for the same reason that roads used by daily drivers are subsidized by remote workers. reply paxys 14 hours agorootparentBad analogy, because it actually costs more to maintain roads that are used more. ISPs don&#x27;t have to pay extra if I consume more data packets than my neighbor. Overage charges are just a money grab on their part, nothing more. reply kulahan 13 hours agorootparentAlso a bad analogy because the roads are paid for with gas taxes, which WFH workers typically purchase less of reply dghlsakjg 13 hours agorootparentA minority of US road costs are paid for with gas taxes, and it depends tremendously on the location. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;data&#x2F;all&#x2F;state&#x2F;states-road-funding...WFH workers likely pay more per mile travelled in taxes than someone who super-commutes. reply Willamin 13 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, we tax roads by usage via fuel (gasoline and diesel) tax [^1]. It&#x27;s a simple solution: the more miles you drive, the more fuel you use; the more fuel you use, the more tax you pay. Vehicles that use more fuel per mile driven tend to be larger and thus cause more wear on the roads.It&#x27;s not without its faults though. Fuel usage isn&#x27;t directly related to cost of road maintenance, it&#x27;s just a very rough approximation. Fuel usage has mattered less and less over the past couple of decades with hybrids and EVs – though this is addressed in some places by imposing an extra EV tax (since EV drivers would pay no fuel tax but would still cause wear on the roads).[^1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fuel_taxes_in_the_United_State... reply dghlsakjg 13 hours agorootparentA minority of roadbuilding funds come from fuel taxes in the US. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;data&#x2F;all&#x2F;state&#x2F;states-road-funding...The additional problem with this is that road wear scales a lot faster than fuel usage. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fourth_power_law reply arcticbull 13 hours agorootparentprevA lot more wear on the roads in a lot of cases, as it&#x27;s exponential (~fourth power) with respect to weight and EVs weigh a lot (~30% more than a comparable ICE car). reply endisneigh 14 hours agorootparentprevIronically roads should also have caps and&#x2F;or tolls, so this take is strange. This is partly why gas and excise tax is a thing… reply eganist 14 hours agorootparent> Ironically roads should also have caps and&#x2F;or tolls, so this take is strange.We&#x27;ll set up electronic tolls on your cul-de-sac and every light and stop sign, or toll you by mile driven using an odometer beaconing out to the tax authorities per drive and registered to your tax ID number (US) or equivalent. And then cap you on the number of miles you&#x27;re allowed to drive per year on all cars unless you pay an additional fee.Older cars must be retrofit at the driver&#x27;s expense.Also the auditing and anti-fraud infrastructure must be instituted for all of this.---Or we can just do flat taxes and chill. reply vel0city 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m absolutely down for vehicle registration fees to relate to miles driven and weight classifications, and major highways being funded by extra tolling.The streets in my neighborhood cost way less per mile for maintenance than giant highways with massive bridges and interchanges. It makes sense they&#x27;d cost more to use.Showing the real cost of these things to consumers might make them change their minds about riding the train. These days a lot of people don&#x27;t even think about the cost of driving their car across town, but gosh that metro day pass is $5? How expensive! reply eganist 12 hours agorootparent> gosh that metro day pass is $5? How expensive!Nah, metro day pass should cost as much as howevermany miles the buyer traveled. Otherwise people who buy the passes for just one stop would be subsidizing the costs for people who travel from one end of a line to the other.It&#x27;d be pretty shit to meter one and not the other. reply endisneigh 12 hours agorootparentprevFlat taxes are regressive and inefficient, but I suppose we can still chill. reply c54 14 hours agorootparentprevThe economy wide productivity gains from having tax funded roads mean it doesn’t make sense to have roads be profitable or break even as an individual entity.Similar thing probably goes for internet access. reply NegativeLatency 13 hours agorootparentGotta be careful what you measure though. If I spend a bunch of money owning and maintaining my car, it&#x27;s possible that that could&#x27;ve been spent on other things that would be overall better for the economy. reply endisneigh 13 hours agorootparentprevTaxes are not flat, just like caps, so there’s no contradiction. reply superb_dev 14 hours agorootparentprevDo you seriously want every road you drive on to charge you? Roads should be a public good that we all benefit from reply NegativeLatency 13 hours agorootparentI would happily pay for congestion pricing because it would allow me to go where I&#x27;m going faster.Right now we have this weird sunk cost and lack of obvious incremental charges to driving, that encourages driving when there are other better options for some trips. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 13 hours agorootparentprevPersonally, that sounds pretty wonderful. Better yet, charge by vehicle weight. I&#x27;d like to be able to ride a bike on the road and have everyone think the guy in the car is imposing inconvenience rather than the other way around. reply endisneigh 13 hours agorootparentprevYou already are charged by every road you drive on, just not explicitly or proportionally. reply notyourwork 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat is ironic about you&#x27;re opinion disagreeing with the status quo in some countries? reply endisneigh 13 hours agorootparentIt’s ironic because they’re arguing against caps but talk about roads, but roads in the United States are in terrible shape due to certain groups, such as construction vehicles not paying their fair share to begin with.This partly why gas tax is even a thing. reply paxys 14 hours agorootparentprevData packets aren&#x27;t a limited resource. The costs for your ISP are fixed whether they serve you 1MB or 1TB. Data caps and overage charges are purely a money grab, not some fundamental economic requirement. So no, infrequent users aren&#x27;t \"subsidizing\" anyone else. reply cortesoft 13 hours agorootparentThis just isn&#x27;t true, though. The limit for a network provider is peak bandwidth usage. When they sell a 2gbps connection to a customer, that 2gbps connection is not reserved entirely for that customer. It isn&#x27;t like the total bandwidth an ISP has is 2gbps * N number of customers.They over-subscribe because they know not every customer is going to be using up that full 2gbps 24&#x2F;7.Now, you can argue that an ISP SHOULD provision that way, with the expectation that their customers are going to be using the full connection 24&#x2F;7, but that would raise the cost per customer a LOT, and I don&#x27;t think people want to be paying for an ISP that provisions like that. It would be a lot more expensive per customer, and it would end up with a lot of the bandwidth going unused most of the time.If the average bandwidth used by customers goes up, it will require the ISP to pay for and maintain more circuits and cost more money. We can argue there are better, fairer, ways to limit usage, but it is simply not true that every customer downloading a lot more doesn&#x27;t cost the ISP more money in the long run. reply musha68k 13 hours agorootparentISPs face costs for peak usage &#x2F; level of “playing with the numbers” yes, but economies of scale and exchange agreements reduce these costs significantly. Bandwidth caps not only have a weak financial justification but also run counter to net neutrality. reply cortesoft 10 hours agorootparentHow do bandwidth costs run counter to net neutrality? (Unless you are talking about certain types of traffic not counting against the caps) reply BigFnTelly 13 hours agorootparentprevwould it be fair to say that bandwidth is just another product sold like plane tickets? reply klabb3 12 hours agorootparentYes? But with orders of magnitude more difference. Let’s do a back of the napkin calculation:Say your ISP gives you 100mbit&#x2F;s = 1.08TB&#x2F;day ≈ 30TB&#x2F;mo. On gigabit that’d be 300TB. While you do have some heavy torrenters they are outliers.Now I assume everything but TV&#x2F;movie streaming is a rounding error for average Joe. Netflix says 1-7GB&#x2F;h depending on quality. Average user watches ~3.2h&#x2F;day (wtf is wrong with people!) but that’s ~100-700 GB&#x2F;mo. Now that’s between 0.033%-2.3% of downstream bandwidth.Of course, people generally watch TV at the same time of day, so it gets more complicated to provision resources. But there’s also no question that pooling bandwidth (over-provisioning) makes sense to reduce costs. The question is more about how much congestion is acceptable, and I wouldn’t trust shitty monopolistic companies to behave. But if you can handle eg Super Bowl or a World Cup final without degradation you’re probably good the rest of the year? reply johncolanduoni 13 hours agorootparentprevWith the crucial difference that the equivalent of 7&#x2F;8ths of a a seat is still useful when it comes to bandwidth, especially for home internet. reply 542458 14 hours agorootparentprev> The costs for your ISP are fixed whether they serve you 1MB or 1TB.That&#x27;s only true in a very abstract sense. If everybody went from using 1MB&#x2F;day to 1TB&#x2F;day there would be massive congestion issues and costs would increase as ISPs rush to install higher-bandwidth equipment. Put a different way: It is cheaper to construct a network where all subscribers consume only 1MB&#x2F;day than a network where all subscribers consume 1TB&#x2F;day, because the former can be done with much lower end equipment. reply paxys 13 hours agorootparentWell it should be true in the concrete sense. If they can&#x27;t consistently serve you at 100mpbs or whatever else then they shouldn&#x27;t advertise it. \"But everyone else is using it at the same time so too bad\" wouldn&#x27;t work as an excuse in any other industry. reply 542458 13 hours agorootparent> If they can&#x27;t consistently serve you at 100mpbs or whatever else then they shouldn&#x27;t advertise it.But that&#x27;s true of almost every industry. Your bank advertises that you can withdraw your money at any time, but if everybody withdrew their money simultaneously there would be issues. A store advertises next-day shipping, but if everybody ordered simultaneously there would be issues. A house might have 100A power service, but if every house started burning 100A simultaneously there would be issues.Put another way, what you&#x27;re proposing is dramatically slower speeds for most users. ISPs are profitable, but they&#x27;re not that profitable. Actual average usage on most lines is probably low single digit percentages, if not sub-1%. I just checked my line - my average use is about 200kB&#x2F;s (for a total of about 500GB per month), or about 1% of my speed cap. reply cortesoft 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you want every ISP to provision the full bandwidth for every customer, so that their network can handle all their customers using their full bandwidth at the same time, it is going to cost each subscriber a LOT more money or get a lot lower peak bandwidth. I think MOST people would prefer to pay less and be able to use the full speed for a fraction of the time.If you want to know how much more expensive the connection would be if you expect to use the full bandwidth 24&#x2F;7, just look at the cost you pay for transit in a datacenter. It is multiples of the cost home consumers pay at a per-bit level.Most users are best served by being told the speeds they will usually get if they stay within average usage patterns, because that is what most people do. reply vasachi 13 hours agorootparentprevYes it would work in any other industry. Users can overload a power grid. Users can overload a telephone network. Users can overload a grocery store. NO industry can deal with critical overload without problems. reply ceejayoz 13 hours agorootparentprev> \"But everyone else is using it at the same time so too bad\" wouldn&#x27;t work as an excuse in any other industry.Go to a grocery store in Florida before a hurricane and try to buy bread. reply arp242 13 hours agorootparentprev> The costs for your ISP are fixed whether they serve you 1MB or 1TB.I cannot believe how anyone with a straight face can claim that the infrastructure and maintenance required to serve \"n times 1MB\" is exactly the same as the costs for \"n times 1TB\". This is so obviously not the case that I genuinely don&#x27;t even know how to explain it.You can serve your thousand subscribers on a dingy Pentium 1 if they&#x27;re using 1MB, because it adds up to just 1,000MB. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to serve just a single customer with the same hardware. Never mind the cabling etc. reply callalex 12 hours agorootparentThere is some truth to what you say but Comcast charges me around $1 per gigabyte over my cap. It absolutely does not cost them that much more money to serve me. reply arp242 12 hours agorootparentAlmost certainly not, no. That it&#x27;s overpriced is of course a different thing. I suspect part of the reason these costs are so high is that they really don&#x27;t want you to use more data, so they won&#x27;t have to upgrade the network. reply phkahler 13 hours agorootparentprev>> Data packets aren&#x27;t a limited resource.No, but bandwidth is. Particularly wireless where you can&#x27;t just lay down another cable or fiber. reply bisby 13 hours agorootparentBandwidth and data caps aren&#x27;t hand in hand. If I download a COD update that is 100gb right now at 1gbps. or I watch 3gb of netflix a day at 10mbps, i&#x27;m still using 100gb. But the bandwidth requirements are very different.They either have infrastructure that can handle 1gbps per user, and then they have bandwidth available, and data caps are nonsense... or they don&#x27;t have the infrastructure, and are banking on their service being idle 90% of the time for most users, and this is why after 5 oclock, my internet goes to crap when everyone is getting home and starting to use the internet. And now suddenly Im drastically overpaying for non-broadband internet because my ISP underprovisioned way too much.This goes back to the point that everyone is making that ISPs shouldn&#x27;t be able to underprovision to the point that it degrades performance during high usage times.My ISP saw $800 million in profits on $2 billion in revenue in 2019. That&#x27;s an AMAZING profit margin. They can afford to not underprovision, and when they don&#x27;t under provision, then no, bandwidth isn&#x27;t a limited resource. reply paxys 13 hours agorootparentprev> No, but bandwidth isWhich is why they already charge for bandwidth reply phkahler 14 hours agorootparentprev>> So that someone&#x27;s grandma who hardly uses her connection can subsidize yo",

    "originBody": "Never be clever. My rude-ass car Published on November 1, 2023 I need to vent about the impolite piece of yet-to-become e-waste on wheels that is my rude-ass car. You've heard versions of this story before, nothing is particularly novel in the shock department, enshittification is everywhere, etcetera... but I need the catharsis. TL;DR I knew car software was bad, but I only realized how bad it was once I got some first-hand experience. What I want in a car For a car, I want a means to transport kids and their associated heaps of stuff around in a safe and relaxed manner. Some functional wheeled metal cage to participate in the joys of fucking over the climate at 100 km per hour. I don't even want my car to go fast anymore because I'm too sleep deprived to enjoy the experience anyway, and gas is not getting any cheaper. You turn the key, the car comes alive to help you whatever needs done. Maybe rev that 0.9 liter econobox engine for the hell of it, but then quickly shift it into gear, subdue your hi-torque dreams of smoking rubber for another day, and drive off. Utilitarian, sensible. A functional, trustworthy tool that doesn't get in your way. The actual experience To my chagrin, the actual experience of driving my recently manufactured car is one of incessant, pointless whining. Operating this machine is like visiting the average news website. At every turn, rude-ass automotive software you didn't ask for clamors for your attention. Unlocking the doors Use your remote to unlock the doors? Better not be encumbered by groceries, screaming kids or other luggage because if you don't open the doors within 15 seconds of unlocking, they close again. Presumably this is done for my own benefit, as everyone knows that leaving a car unlocked for more than a minute immediately invites thieves to come feast on the crumbs of rice crackers littering the back seat. Closing the trunk Did you put stuff in the trunk? Press a button and it will attempt to close itself (at a glacial pace). I say 'attempt', because if there is any item placed within 50 cm of the edge of the trunk, it will loudly complain and open again at a significantly brisker pace (so it could move faster when closing, it just won't). What problem is this solving exactly? Me waving my arm up and down to close the trunk? What was a 1 second operation now takes at least 10 seconds, and often a lot of angry beeping. Starting the engine DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! Six obnoxiously loud gong-like sounds reverberate through the interior of your car upon pressing the 'start/stop engine' button. But, only if you put it in neutral first, refrain from even thinking about touching the accelerator pedal, and fully depress the clutch (even though you just put it in fucking neutral) Using your turn signals Conveniently, the outside mirrors have a little orange dot indicating cars in your blind spot. Less conveniently is the additional auditory feedback that - you guessed it - whines its warnings at you when you use your turn signals to change lanes when there is someone nearby. I get why this exists, I see the utility and I can even force myself to feel unbothered by the ridiculously high sensitivity. However. If you're at a traffic light, in the rightmost lane with two lanes turning left, of course the demented tamagotchi on wheels thinks you are about to sideswipe the car to your left. Because this pisses me off so badly, I've taken to not using turn signals in such cases, to avoid triggering this \"feature\". Coming to a full stop There's a lane keeping assistant, which understandably enough wants you to keep touching the steering wheel. If you bring the vehicle to a full stop with the lane keeper on, it will still demand that you wiggle the steering wheel to signal that you aren't suddenly taking a nap or changing someones diaper in the back seat. Traffic jam? Traffic light? Parking your car somewhere? DING! DING! DING! The goddamn tires themselves This must be a simple mechanical defect with my car but the tire pressure sensors trigger after prolonged (> 1 hr) driving at high speeds (~ 130 km/hr). It complains about low tire pressure, and invariably when I measure them, they're just fine. Getting out of this physical incarnation of an AliExpress storefront You arrive at your destination, blood pressure off the chart, an angry vein throbbing in your neck. You open the door. DING DING DING! ENGINE STILL RUNNING! DING DING! DID YOU LEAVE ANYTHING IN THE BACK SEAT! DING! DON'T FORGET YOUR PHONE! Can it really be that bad? Just typing this makes my blood boil. I realize I haven't even touched upon emergency evasive movements. A slow car swerves across lanes, ending up front of you? You want to pull on the steering wheel to avoid a collision? Well fuck you because now you have to fight the lane keeping assistant because how dare you get out of your lane without first signaling your \"I have 0.67 seconds to move or else my license plate gets replaced by an entire Renault Twingo\" action. You're being histrionic. The infotainment unit is surprisingly good. Save for the fact that in the past year, it has asked me to accept four different, updated versions of the Terms and Conditions. I'd gladly just click the button that means \"whatever\" because, you know, who has the energy to care about the next adtech grifter selling your butt's temperature profile to 721 interested third parties? But out of sheer spite and loathing, instead I keep hammering the one that says \"don't accept for now, but keep nagging me forever until I accidentally click on the other button\". At least I'm familiar with this particular enshittified experience from interacting with other, non-automotive appliances. Edit: for the record, this is about a Kia Ceed SW, but it's not that important because I'm sure 90% of all 2023 cars run on the CAN bus equivalent of a 10.000 line, 100 cell Jupyter Notebook that was last restarted in the fall of 2018.

Check, check, and check.Mid nineties to mid aughts are the absolute high point for me, where you get all the technology but none of the heinous \"you rent all your things\" features that smear newer vehicles. The downside is dodging the mid-aughts quality hangover Honda seemed to have suffered in the period - really just fit and finish, but still annoying - and more importantly the long train of suck that was Hyundai Theta&#x2F;Gamma family engines and derivatives. Hyundai reached a leeeetle too far in the late aughts, with some sci-fi internal combustion tricks, but oof, that was a hard pill after their fantastic Delta V6s. reply RF_Savage 3 hours agoparentThe more time goes on, the more 1998 being the height of human civilization in The Matrix starts making sense.I certainly wonder how repairable cars will be in ten years.

I like my 2015 Golf.The telemetry has long since stopped working but I’m left with is a car with adaptive cruise control and between 50-80mpg (imperial).Record was 82mpg after following a lory on a 150 mile motorway run.It’s still got useful satnav, infotainment systems and all the safety features I’m aware of.It even has nice little touches like the self-dimming rear-view mirror, for when you’ve got a berk with full-beams on driving up your arse at night.I’d miss that stuff on an older car.I can afford to get a new car every year if I wanted but modern cars are annoying and creepy.I have no idea what I’d replace it with so I just keep it running. reply willtemperley 2 hours agorootparentAgreed on 2015 being the peak - I have a Mazda 6 which has similar mpg and is big enough to be a stealth camper.The only contrivance I could do without is keyless ignition, which provides an effective attack vector for thieves and the ability to lose the keys while driving.A mobile phone in works well to augment the aging infotainment &#x2F; satnav, the only issue being UK law is unclear on whether it&#x27;s allowable to touch a phone in a cradle.

It gets driven hard so it has some problems, and everyone around me keeps pressuring me to get a new car. I&#x27;ve looked, and I&#x27;ve driven a pile of rentals, and everything is just so awful. I think 2010 is about the latest model year I&#x27;d ever go.So instead I&#x27;m getting a really sweet new motor built for mine. Still the same 4.0, but with updated components and a focus on improved efficiency. My target is 25mpg highway. ...and a little bit of hooning around the desert racing circuit maybe. :-)Even with a fancy motor (and transmission), it&#x27;ll still be less money than a new replacement vehicle, and most importantly, it won&#x27;t piss me off all the time. With already-upgraded suspension, steering, and some electronics, it&#x27;s kinda fun and quite capable.The only thing I&#x27;m really missing is safety. Jeeps are pretty terrible at the moose test to begin with, and 2001 was too early for side curtain airbags. I think I can retrofit 2004 side curtain bags into mine, and I&#x27;m redistributing weight in the vehicle that, along with some of the newer electronic suspensions, should improve its highway handling. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentprevI had one of those and while it was a great car in the Canadian North I&#x27;d hate to drive in Europe with the gas prices here right now. reply downut 12 hours agoparentprevThey can&#x27;t pry my 2001 v8 4wd 14mpg[1] Tundra bought new for cash from my cold dead hands because I am seriously thinking of when I die I get laid out in the bed and the whole shebang put in an enormous hole and buried somewhere.

We call it Ed Truck the red truck. It has 363,000 miles now and I’m the current owner. The engine and whole truck is incredible. I think about how different it must have been made when I think about things like it still being on the original AC compressor and never needing even refrigerant after 363,000 miles and 22 years. Such a testament to the Toyota Way. All the buttons and controls still work, which is very much not the norm after owning many other cars.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Toyota_Way reply TylerE 7 hours agoparentprevI am mostly with you, but preferring a timing chain to a timing belt is... interesting. Virtually every engine I know with a chain ends up either regularly failing early, or requiring early (and labor intensive, and thus expensive) unscheduled replacement off all the tensioners, etc. reply Fradow 1 hour agorootparentTo be honest, that depends on the engine itself.For example, on BMW Minis, which all have timing chains:- 1st gens Minis (2002 -> 2006 roughly), with Chrysler engines, have a bulletproof engine, and replacing the timing chain is a rare occurrence- 2nd gens Mini (2007 -> 2013 roughly) with PSA engines modified by BMW have a suicidal engines, especially the pre-LCI (2007 -> 2009) engines, that are known to often break timing chain guides. The symptom for that is named \"death rattle\", which is chain slap.- 3nd gens Mini (2014 -> 2022 roughly) with BMW engines are so far known to be pretty bulletproof. Note that some of them now have high mileage with no large-scale issues.So a well-designed engine with a timing chain is preferable to a timing belt. But a timing belt is preferable to a problematic engine with a timing chain, which will break at the most inconvenient time and leave you with an unexpected large bill. reply MilStdJunkie 52 minutes agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a general rule, and it&#x27;s mostly because I can tell when the chain&#x27;s wearing down. If the belt is accessible, it&#x27;s also not as big a deal.As with all things, the build quality and overall design will overrule single atomized design decisions. GM iron dukes have geared cams, which should be frickin&#x27; bulletproof, but they use a nylon spindle that tends to blow apart under variable load or just using weird fluids. reply genter 7 hours agorootparentprevCare to share some? Because that&#x27;s the exact opposite of my experience. I&#x27;ve never heard of a chain itself failing, but the plastic guides can get brittle and break. I think BMW and some Fords are bad at that.I&#x27;ve owned several high mileage vehicles (over 300k) including Toyota 22RE, 3RZ, and Chevy LS with their original timing chain. Now that I think about it, does the LS even have a tensioner or chain guide? reply jdietrich 6 hours agorootparentBelts tend to fail abruptly and catastrophically, but generally only if they&#x27;re neglected and used well beyond their design life. Chains fail more insidiously, because they get longer over time. The pins eat away at the plates, increasing the spacing between the rollers. This isn&#x27;t immediately noticeable, because the timing sprockets will wear to match the altered dimensions of the chain. Worn chains cause all sorts of subtle timing problems and the lifespan of a chain is much less predictable, because it&#x27;s highly dependent on lubrication; missed oil changes or poor oil quality will drastically accelerate chain wear.From an enthusiast&#x27;s perspective, a chain is probably preferable, because it tends to give you some warning before it fails - you might hear a rattle at idle, you might have problems with starting or misfires, you might get a check engine light and an EBD-II code from the timing sensors. That&#x27;s a much less scary prospect than the potential for a sudden and catastrophic failure of a timing belt.From a manufacturer or dealership&#x27;s perspective, belts have some clear advantages. Unless there was a manufacturing defect in the belt, they&#x27;ll almost never cause trouble if replaced according to schedule. That has obvious liability implications - it&#x27;s not their fault if the customer ignores the specified replacement interval, but it potentially is their fault if a chain wears faster than expected. BMW, VAG and Jaguar Land Rover have all recently settled class action lawsuits related to the premature failure of timing chains. reply Moru 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m more of a hobby bicycle mechanic. Isn&#x27;t there some similar tool for the meassuring of the chain as you get for bicycles? Just push it down and you directly see if it&#x27;s time to change the chain. If not done early enough you have to change all the sprockets too because of wear. If done in time, you might not have to change all the sprockets. reply jdietrich 10 minutes agorootparentYou can measure it with an ordinary caliper, but the problem is getting access. The timing chain needs to be continuously supplied with oil, so it is in rather than on the engine and can rarely be accessed without pulling the engine from the car. It takes several hours just to access the chain for inspection, so it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d periodically check - if you suspect a timing chain problem, you might as well replace it. reply globular-toast 2 hours agorootparentprevVW had a few years making cars with chains that would catastrophically fail. Lots of destroyed engines. It was the EA888 put in Golf GTIs from 2010 and on. After like 5 or something revisions they finally improved the tensioner that caused the failure.Previous gen GTI was a belt. Garage told me they preferred belts because people know they need to replace those. People aren&#x27;t expecting to be told your chain needs to be replaced plus it&#x27;s much more expensive and labour intensive.Never heard of Honda having problems with chains, though. Some of their motorbikes even had gear driven cams! (VFR I think). reply samtho 1 hour agorootparentCan confirm, have a 2012 GTI, replaced the stretched chain on it about 10 days ago. The problem is that they provided no service interval for the timing chain when it really needs replacement every 80K miles. It’s an enthusiast car so there are a ton of aftermarket parts that are of good quality and VAG cars share so many parts (the 2.0T e888 engine is in a ton of vehicles from 2008 through today). My car has 211K and I intend to take it well over 300K. reply neoromantique 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had two bmw e39&#x27;s with a m57 engines, and these chains last literally forever. One of my engines has over 500k clocked on it, no chain rattle still.Buuuuut, there&#x27;s also modern Opel engines where timing chain is guaranteed to kill the engine if not replaced every 100k km.So it really depends on the engine rather being simple chain vs belt. reply Hamuko 2 hours agorootparentI think the BMW N47 and Mercedes-Benz M271 are infamous for timing chain issues. reply whichfawkes 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve only ever heard people prefer chains. reply wigglewoggle 7 hours agorootparentChains usually have no service interval, so at the outset they seem cheaper and more reliable. But the unfortunate reality is they still fail, or something related to keeping them on fails, you just live in a false sense of security for a few 10&#x27;s of thousands of km more reply TylerE 6 hours agorootparentThe good old “lifetime” part. Just like the “lifetime” fluid in most newer automatic trans. reply Hamuko 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd since they&#x27;re not meant to be serviced on a regular interval, they&#x27;re designed that way too. A timing chain might be over four times the expense to replace when compared to a timing belt, but possibly without actually lasting over four times long. reply CarVac 7 hours agorootparentprevThe gen 2 Prius has a timing chain and it&#x27;s one of the most reliable vehicles of all time. reply jareklupinski 8 hours agoparentprevthe literal united states federal government had to step in to take my diesel golf away from me reply barbazoo 6 hours agoparentprevI think you may have changed my life.

How do you deal with carb problems? reply zxexz 2 hours agorootparentprevCars from the mid-noughts (the right ones of course! [0]) are the sweet-spot for me. New enough to have modern safety features (like airbags - I know, funny to refer to that as modern) - but still be user-serviceable.I bought an relatively \"bad condition\", top of the line (at the time) 4Runner for well less than 10 grand, spent 40 hours of effort on DIY repairs and maintenance over the course of a month. Ended up with a \"bulletproof\" machine that not only passed inspection - it&#x27;s a pleasure to drive, is modded to my liking. That 40 hours of effort would have been less than 10 for a seasoned mechanic, and the bill would have brought the total cost of the car to maybe just slightly over $10k.Finding a physical copy of the service and repair \"manual\" (it&#x27;s 8 volumes...) for the exact make, model and year of the car was easy and cost $100. Spent a few hundred on specialized tools, and about 1.5k on parts. The car is old enough that there are several old-school forums with a wealth of knowledge on everything from muffler replacement, rust-removal tactics, to transfer case repair - and those forums are still incredibly active!Also, now that I&#x27;m apparently mind dumping, my personal advice for people living in rust-prone areas (the rust belt, northeast, etc.) - if you can, get a used vehicle from another area. If you can&#x27;t - fine - but make sure you can inspect the frame rust, do the \"hammer check\", etc. Remove any rust you can, get an undercoating, and wash regularly (especially during winter). BUT don&#x27;t be too scared of some frame rust, especially if the price is right. Lots of body-on-frame cars&#x2F;trucks are actually pretty structurally repairable if you hire a good tech to do the rust cleaning, sawing, and welding. Also, a frame swap is actually quite doable for a few grand if you find a good shop (people do do it themselves but without experience and a full shop it&#x27;s a pretty dangerous and hardcore endeavor) and are able to source a frame (often less than $1k plus a few hundred in shipping from a scrap yard in the south - or just buy a second used car that&#x27;s \"worthless\" for all the reasons yours isn&#x27;t, and swap that frame).[0] My experience with cars of this era is mostly with Toyotas and Subarus - both makes are very user-serviceable (IME Subarus are easier, but on average the parts more bespoke and more expensive, Toyotas are more finnicky to work with on average but way cheaper part-wise and way easier to patch together in a pinch). I&#x27;ve worked on a Honda Pilot from that era, it was also a breeze - and tons of DIY-focused car people are \"Honda for life\". I know a couple people who swear by Nissans from that era, but they caveat that with transmission issues for certain models in certain years (I don&#x27;t remember which). reply bandyaboot 8 hours agorootparentprevBring back carbs and crank starts!

Several of my Driver™ friends complain about such warnings with passion. reply rconti 8 hours agorootparentThis is a bad take if you haven&#x27;t driven every single car on the market in order to inform yourself.I agree most of them are surprisingly good -- the forward collision warning system on my Golf R only made a few mistakes in the 3 years I owned it, and they were all \"understandable\" mistakes where the tech clearly didn&#x27;t understand why it was &#x27;wrong&#x27; -- eg, I refused to lift throttle because I knew the car in front of me was about to accelerate due to the light which had just turned green, or I elected not to brake because the car cutting in front of me was swooping across two lanes so it wasn&#x27;t worth panicking about.The system on my Model 3 is GREAT, but only when set to \"late\" ; my aunt&#x27;s car was constantly hassling her until I found the setting and moved it from normal to late.But there are other such annoying automated systems -- my Golf had a REAR collision warning which would fully engage the brakes if you were reversing down your driveway while a car was driving down the street behind you. I suppose it wanted me to wait until the road had NO traffic before daring to reverse on my own private property.Also, some cars try to overthink things for you. I&#x27;ve driven vehicles where if you drive in a spirited manner, lifting off the throttle abruptly and engaging the brakes quickly but not aggressively, it decides you MUST want to perform a panic stop and doubles the brake pressure. I think most of us can agree that we want our machines to perform in a reliable and consistent manner and not have basic controls second guess us? reply blep_ 7 hours agorootparentI like how you disagree with the parent comment suggesting you drive very aggressively, and then nearly every example you give of the car being wrong is a direct result of you driving very aggressively. reply barrkel 1 hour agorootparentLifting off the throttle and on to the brakes quickly but gently is a natural safety decision if your going fast on a motorway and someone slower changes into your lane up ahead.This is the primary reason for emergency brake assist kicking in for me in my car, Skoda Superb (VW group so similar software).

They both will consistently issue the RED-FLASH!+BEEP!!+BEEP!!+BRAKE (sometimes), when driving around a turn with a car or especially truck parked on the outside road shoulder. The car cannot figure out that I&#x27;m not going straight into the \"obstacle\", and so warns me. Too late for me to actually do anything about it if I were to actually be heading straight into the parked obstacle, but it goes right ahead. The only possible benefit is if it is also silently pre-tensioning the belts & priming the airbags, but it could do that without the histrionics.Both cars also far too often will alert on mere cracks or patches in the road ahead, with no obstacles.There are other times they mis-alert in their own ways or randomly, and it isn&#x27;t often enough to dump the cars, but it is definitely bad. The warnings are also timed so as to be absolutely useless were it an actual emergency, and I say that as a qualified & championship-winning road-racing driver who has at least better than average situational awareness & reaction times. I can say absolutely that if this \"warning system\" were to be my first alert to an emergency, there is no way I could take effective action in time.So I have no idea who are the clueless wankers designing and implementing it; it is evidently for only their own self-satisfaction to justify their existence.

With kids getting in and out, I wouldn’t want it to be any faster. And unlike in the article, they don’t stop until they actually encounter resistance - which worked fine the one time my kid closed the door on me when I was fetching something out of the back seat.The proximity sensors do beep pretty loudly every time I get near an obstacle - which is frankly more often than not when parking, and my wife does find it pretty annoying. But it’s a large car, and visibility around the front and rear corners is not great - so I appreciate having an extra audio cue when I’m approaching an obstacle. Often my goal is to get as close as possible to said obstacle when parking (wall, fence, etc) - so my cue to stop is when it finally plays the long sustained beep to let me know that impact is imminent.I’ve only had automatic breaking engage a few times. Mostly when I back into a parking space too fast and it thinks I’m going to crash - which is easy enough to avoid by going a bit slower. Once it engaged while I was stopped at a traffic light due to a massive downpour which I guess confused the proximity sensor. That was annoying, and could have been worse if I were actually moving, but I just turned it off with a button on the dashboard and carried on.I find lane keeping assistance (which engages automatically with cruise control) to be incredibly useful on highways, and while it does get wonky sometimes in heavy snow or around construction sites, the car is pretty good about disengaging the feature automatically when it gets confused and makes a ding to let me know. At that point I’ll usually just turn it off manually with a button on the steering wheel until conditions improve. The article mentions needing to keep applying force to the steering wheel even when stopped, but my car doesn&#x27;t require that.There’s also a lane departure warning that engages if I cross over a lane divider without signaling first, which plays two short beeps and applies some force to the steering wheel. But easy enough to override if I continue applying force, and most of the time it’s my fault for not signaling properly anyway.Doors do automatically lock themselves again after a while, but it’s nowhere close to 15 seconds like in the article. It’s maybe happened once or twice and no big deal to unlock again. On the other hand there have been times when I have unlocked my car because I wanted to grab something, and then got distracted and never actually visited it. In these cases I’m glad to have it lock itself again vs. remaining unlocked for several hours.My car does play a chime at startup, but it’s not unpleasant, and I’m so used to my now that I have stopped noticing it.I don&#x27;t have tire pressure sensors - but my mother had a car with this feature many years ago and they were indeed prone to false alarms. She took it to the dealer several times to fix it, and the dealer pretty much acknowleged that they were garbage. Not sure if she ever got it fixed permanently or just learned to ignore it.Anyway - I know that a lot of this stuff varies by manufacturer and model, so I’m not saying my experience is universal. But for anyone asking who actually appreciates this stuff - I do. Staying safe is really important to me, and whatever annoyance the safety systems in my car cause is easily offset by their benefit. I certainly wouldn’t want to go back in time to before safety assistance features existed. reply mavamaarten 13 hours agoprevVery recognizable!I&#x27;ve driven quite a lot of different cars over the years, and every one has had the same and different flaws like these.My current car (Audi) has a system that connects with other Audi&#x27;s in the neighborhood and warns for \"dangers\" ahead. It cannot be disabled, not even temporarily. Those dangers are completely normal situations, unfortunately. It warns for \"limited visibility\" aka there is some light fog, but in practice this warning triggers every time there is some sun shining in the camera sensor. Another warning is slippery road, which is triggered when you plant your foot down and lose some traction (aka classic Audi driver behavior in my city).The result is that almost every drive, even with perfectly sunny weather, you get a loud beep (the same beep as an engine check light or a flat tire warning) and a warning about poor visibility or slippery roads, which completely distracts you.

I am able to disable all of the features you&#x27;re mentioning on this car, and I can also choose whether alerts are only visual in the HUD or if they are visual + audible.The only thing I can&#x27;t disable is the ding when you start the car without first having your driver&#x27;s seatbelt buckled, which does annoy the shit out of me because it&#x27;s a turbo car and I want to give it a few seconds of warm-up before driving to be nicer to it, which I do while getting settled. I always wear a seatbelt, but I buckle it last before I start driving, not first when I first get in the car.Otherwise it seems pretty great. It was very annoying off the lot, but 20 minutes with the owner&#x27;s manual in my driveway and I made it tolerable while keeping all the advance technology.Maybe I&#x27;ll find additional annoyances over time, this is my first car I&#x27;ve owned with all the new-fangled safety technology designed for normies who can&#x27;t drive properly. reply izacus 13 hours agoparentIn EU, the 2024 Mazda3s now have to comply with new directive where they DING every time you go slightly over the speed limit.

I kept it to visual only and set it to alert when I went more than 5MPH over the speed limit, because I want to help keep myself honest.It&#x27;s disappointing it&#x27;s forced to ding in the EU. In the US, there are many roads where you &#x2F;must&#x2F; drive over the speed limit or you become a road obstruction that is actually putting yourself and others at risk. As an example, several Interstate highways have sections that drop to 65MPH through major metros but outside of high-traffic periods, the established speed is 80MPH on these, just as it is on other sections of the same Interstate (where the speed limit is likely 75MPH). reply LargoLasskhyfv 9 hours agorootparentThen make it mandatory to have all the vehicles equipped with &#x27;Dingibility&#x27;, just like in the movie Demolition Man :-) reply neogodless 13 hours agoparentprevSame.

When it isn&#x27;t hanging&#x2F;crashing (which it does about once a week) it prevents using any of the screen controls while the car is moving. Instead you need to take your eyes off the road longer to use a physical dial to scroll to the control you want to press.

Perhaps the car&#x27;s software doesn&#x27;t take that into account? reply odensc 8 hours agorootparentSome cars use \"indirect TPMS,\" which means instead of a sensor in the tire&#x27;s valve stem, it measures the speed of each wheel and uses some fancy math to determine if the pressure is low.I&#x27;m not sure if the Kia Ceed is one of such cars, but if it is, there may be some wackiness in their indirect TPMS system. Especially considering the OP says it only happens after prolonged driving at high speeds. reply doubled112 13 hours agorootparentprevI believe air pressure increases with temperature, which shouldn&#x27;t set off a low pressure warning.I wonder which style of tire pressure monitoring they&#x27;re using.One is to measure the output from the wheel speed sensors. A difference in speed is assumed to mean a difference in size. A smaller tire must be a low tire.The other is to have actual sensors in the tires that read pressures. They&#x27;re usually paired to the car.I have a set of tires (with sensors) in the garage that my car will pick up from the driveway. The sensor reads and everything looks great. The alarm will go off to tell me the sensor isn&#x27;t reading anymore a few KMs from home, and it is correct. reply FireBeyond 7 hours agorootparent> The other is to have actual sensors in the tires that read pressures.Hell, my car (admittedly a performance vehicle) will give you exact PSI, but more than that, even gives you individual tire temperatures. reply JohnBooty 13 hours agorootparentprevRaising the temp raises the tire pressure, so that definitely shouldn&#x27;t cause a low pressure warning.But, broadly speaking, definitely sounds like they didn&#x27;t take something into account w.r.t. hot tire pressure. Maybe the tire sensors are throwing a warning because the temp is too high, and the software is incorrectly displaying it as a low pressure warning, or... or some other hellish combination of failure. reply ragingrobot 13 hours agorootparent> the software is incorrectly displaying it as a low pressure warningThe post doesn&#x27;t specify if the display actually says low pressure, or if the TPMS warning light comes on, which we usually interpret as low pressure (most common case). If it is the TPMS light, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s more of an \"out of range\" warning than \"low pressure.\" reply theandrewbailey 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, friction heats the tires (and air inside them) when being driven, more so with more speed and time, creating extra pressure in the tires. I&#x27;ve had my car complain to me about tire pressure a handful of times, only to check the pressure and noticed 3 more PSI than usual in one tire, all others OK. reply ghostly_s 13 hours agorootparentprevseriously, why would you avoid naming whilst shamung? reply jacquesm 8 hours agoparentprevGreat writing! And I totally sympathize which is why I now drive a rebuilt 26 year old car. reply DamnInteresting 12 hours agoprevOn the subject of automobiles making strange assumptions, my Chevy Bolt EV has a \"feature\" that I have never been able to understand:The car has 2 drive modes: \"D\" and \"L\". The \"D\" mode mimics an automatic ICE car--it creeps forward when one lets off the brake, and coasts for a long time when one lets off the accelerator. I always drive the car in \"L\" mode, which is the aggressive regenerative braking mode. When I let off the gas it slows to a stop quickly (assuming the battery is not near full charge). And it does not creep when I release the brake.But there is one bizarre exception: If I power on the car and put it in \"L\" mode, but I haven&#x27;t yet fastened my seat belt, the car will creep forward when I let off the brake, just like in D. This has caught me off guard a few times, but I&#x27;ve always caught it and hit the brakes before the car rolled into my garage door or a car parked in front of me.I once brought it up on &#x2F;r&#x2F;BoltEV, and someone claiming to be a Chevrolet engineer told me this behavior was by design, but had no good justification for it. reply evilaubergine 1 hour agoparentThe reason is for safety (so people don&#x27;t get out of their car while it&#x27;s halted in L without the parking brake), this did cause me to (slowly) crash once, I am sure people have been nearly injured by the safety feature.I later replaced my Bolt with a Tesla Model 3 (yeah, I have a lot of complaints here too, but overall it&#x27;s less annoying) purely for fast-charging reasons, but driving a Bolt again afterwards drove me absolutely insane with their L mode: - have to enable it each drive - doesn&#x27;t work in reverse - creeps when seatbelt comes unbuckled and sometimes RANDOMLY - randomly decides it&#x27;s not going to regen as much even when low on chargeI know it&#x27;s not the top of anybody else&#x27;s demands from a car, but what the fuck Chevrolet. There should always be a button for \"I didn&#x27;t buy an EV by accident, now let me fucking drive it normally\".The truth is Chevrolet never intended to allow you to use L mode to drive at all. They only added it in, so you can put on the parking brake, and tap down the gear selector repeatedly to switch between L and D, making your car bounce up and down. I don&#x27;t know of any other car with an electric twerking lever, and for that reason, it still holds a special place in my heart. reply callalex 10 hours agoparentprevThe real explanation is that every “L” or “B” mode on a hybrid or EV exactly duplicates the behavior of the original hybrid, the 2001 Toyota Prius.

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP PERSONAL TECH Asahi Linux goes from Apple Silicon port project to macOS bug hunters 8 Refresh rate glitch could leave MacBook Pro 14\" and 16\" models unbootable Richard Speed Wed 1 Nov 2023 // 17:01 UTC Asahi Linux, a project to port Linux to Apple Silicon Macs, has reported a combination of bugs in Apple's macOS that could leave users with hardware in a difficult-to-recover state. The issues revolve around how recent versions of macOS handle refresh rates, and MacBook Pro models with ProMotion displays (the 14 and 16-inch versions) are affected. According to the Asahi team, the bugs lurk in the upgrade and boot process and, when combined, can create a condition where a machine always boots to a black screen, and a Device Firmware Update (DFU) recovery is needed. Asahi Linux's techies have looked into the issue, having first suspected it had something to do with either having an Asahi Linux installation on a Mac and then upgrading to macOS Sonoma or installing Asahi Linux after a Sonoma upgrade. However, the issue appears to be unconnected to the project. The team said: \"As far as we can tell, ALL users who upgraded to Sonoma the normal way have an out-of-date or even broken System RecoveryOS, and in particular MacBook Pro 14\" and 16\" owners are vulnerable to ending up with a completely unbootable system.\" While this might sound alarming, the team was at pains to assure users that data was not at risk and only certain versions of macOS were affected – Sonoma 14.0+ and Ventura 13.6+. The first bug is related to macOS Sonoma using the previously installed version as System Recovery, which can cause problems when an older RecoveryOS runs into newer firmware. Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter Fedora and Asahi Linux pals revamp installation process Asahi Linux project hooks up with Fedora: Remix that's not a remix coming soon Asahi Linux developer warns the one true way is Wayland The second occurs if a display is configured to a refresh rate other than ProMotion. According to the Asahi Linux team, the system will no longer be able to boot into old macOS installs or Asahi Linux. \"This includes recovery mode when those systems are set as the default boot OS, and also System Recovery at least until the next subsequent OS upgrade.\" The Asahi Linux installer has been tweaked to check for the issue and will refuse to install if the refresh rate on affected machines is set to anything other than ProMotion mode. It will also perform an integrity check to verify the status of the System Recovery partition before making any changes. The team noted: \"Even users with just 13.6 installed single-boot are affected by this issue (no Asahi Linux needed). \"We do not understand how Apple managed to release an OS update that, when upgraded to normally, leaves machines unbootable if their display refresh rate is not the default. This seems to have been a major QA oversight by Apple.\" The Register contacted Apple to get its take on the report and will update should the company respond. ® Sponsored: Helping you bridge the cloud security gap More about Apple Linux MacBook More like these 8 COMMENTS TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Apple lifts the sheet on a trio of 'scary fast' M3 SoCs built on a 3nm process MacBook Pro and iMac get the new silicon, and price tags up to a terrifying $7,199 PERSONAL TECH 2 days84 Apple swipes left on the last Touch Bar Mac, replaces it with a pricier 14″ model COMMENT Proper function keys are the norm once more and the dream of a touchscreen Mac appears to be dead PERSONAL TECH 1 day48 Date night from hell looms for Apple as Netherlands says: 'It's not me, it's you' Watchdog reportedly well and truly out of love with App Store concessions and fee cuts PERSONAL TECH 1 day3 Putting AI challenges in perspective with partnerships How organizations en route to AI sufficiency can ease their journey by working with tech providers like HPE SPONSORED FEATURE Side channel attacks take bite out of Apple silicon with iLeakage exploit Nearly six years on from Spectre and Meltdown, novel method steals passwords, emails, texts RESEARCH 7 days10 World checks it's not April 1 as Apple signals support for full US right-to-repair rule But beware geeks bearing gifts PERSONAL TECH 8 days29 Apple jacks prices to juice profits because $19.3B a quarter isn't enough Shareholders rejoice!

It&#x27;s just that more people are into (for example) web apps than OS development. If you spend some time in embedded dev land, things like that make sense. You just get better at thinking at hardware level &#x2F; synchronising devices, etc.I mean, they&#x27;re still super clever, but people learn that stuff by reading about it and practicing.

These days I actually get paid to write Javascript (something young me would&#x27;ve found unbelievable enough already), but to me that&#x27;s still a huge difference from \"real\" programming, especially in C or assembly.Web dev (at least the kind I do) is mostly still just declaring UI in a XML like syntax, then wrapping it up in some events and state management. It&#x27;s not that different from, say, Visual Basic. At its core it&#x27;s a bunch of event driven reactions and API calls based on UI clicks. Once upon time that was Perl or PHP or jQuery, now it&#x27;s usually React, but the fundamental process of \"declare UI, add event handlers, send to APIs\" hasn&#x27;t changed much IMO.But an OS? Man, how do you work with memory access? Overflows? Garbage collection? Device drivers? Caching? Graphics pipelines? USB? Lightning?

Man, how do you work with memory access? Overflows? Garbage collection? Device drivers? Caching? Graphics pipelines? USB? Lightning?You start much simpler. Grab some ESP32 or ARM development board and start with trivial things on them. Simple devices also have simple drivers - sure, trying to connect to an NVIDIA card is hard, but an 128x128 LCD display is trivial. Then you build more complex things on top of that. Same with PHP - you start with &#x27;echo \"hello world\"&#x27; rather than full reactive page with many server routing endpoints. reply SonOfLilit 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s almost exactly the same, except the building blocks are much simpler (=more primitive) so you have to spend more time per useful thing you want to get the machine to do.If you want to get a taste of what that means that is definitely 100% within your abilities, try to write a Brainfuck interpreter in JS, and a Brainfuck to JavaScript compiler (that yields a string that you can eval() to run the program).Then try to write some simple Brainfuck programs, then try to write a Brainfuck interpreter in Brainfuck. At this point you won&#x27;t yet know how to write an operating system, but you&#x27;ll definitely know how it feels to write one. reply solardev 8 hours agorootparentHeh, that seems like a perfect weekend project for whenever I feel like I&#x27;m missing a swift kick in the nuts. reply agar 5 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the laugh. reply hnfong 5 hours agorootparentprevTechnologies become more complex as people accumulate experience.Web only started in the 90s, and was intentionally designed to be simple (html and stuff).

It&#x27;s having the capacity to fix the bugs.And when you are this early in the OS release cycle (we are only at 14.1) there are inevitably a lot of P1 issues that limited resources are competing to fix. reply Wowfunhappy 13 hours agorootparentBut I have to imagine an issue that renders Macs unbootable would have been considered blocking, had Apple known about it. reply threeseed 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s an edge case with a workaround. P2 and definitely not enough to prevent a release.Only 14&#x2F;16-inch models where users have explicitly disable ProMotion and are desperate to boot into the RecoveryOS. reply Wowfunhappy 13 hours agorootparentMy understanding was that if you disable ProMotion you can become unable to boot into your main OS. reply MichaelZuo 6 hours agorootparentprevLike the other user said, this bug effects a much larger set of customers.To ship this severity of bug in an X.6 release too is definitely very eyebrow raising. reply callalex 9 hours agorootparentprevWho&#x2F;what is limiting those resources? It certainly isn’t a lack of US Dollars. Is it executives on the financial team requiring a never ending increase in profit margins even though the margins from two years ago were also infinitely sustaining? reply SamuelAdams 8 hours agorootparentMost likely people. As large as Apple is, there’s only so many programmers writing code.

More test to find more bugs. reply troupo 6 hours agorootparentprev> And when you are this early in the OS release cycle (we are only at 14.1)I hope this was a joke :)The worst thing that Apple did to themselves is force everything and everyone into a yearly release cycle reply stuaxo 14 hours agorootparentprevApple would want them to sign an NDA and that would be incompatible with them doing as much as they do in Linux. reply danieldk 12 hours agorootparentApple can decide to not let them sign an NDA and just pay them for the excellent work that they are doing now and give them a good priority channel for reporting issues. reply dmonitor 11 hours agorootparentwhy would apple pay them to do something they already do for free? reply danShumway 11 hours agorootparentI very much doubt the math for the PR-to-cost ratio works out to justify hiring them, but presumably the reason would be so that Apple wouldn&#x27;t have to see articles like this or to have the top comment on tech threads be \"this is a huge embarrassment for Apple\".Similar reason as to why companies have bug bounties; they want to incentivize hackers to report bugs through official channels early enough in development that they can get patched before release and before tech journalists write articles about them. They don&#x27;t want to find out that their products have bugs via social media. Even if that process happens out in the open via a Github issue, getting giant problems like this caught before release and quickly escalated internally through official channels would go a long way towards mitigating article titles like this.Having said that, does Apple care about the Register or HN? Probably not? And assuming that Apple did care about bad PR among extreme power-users, would Asahi Linux want to be paid by Apple to do testing on their releases? That&#x27;s also not necessarily a given, the team would have to decide if they wanted to have a more official relationship with the company or not. reply fostware 10 hours agorootparentPretty sure TheReg has been on the Apple blacklist for PR and industry events for some time. Like TheReg, I think it&#x27;d be a badge of honor... replyAceJohnny2 13 hours agoparentprevFor one thing, when you&#x27;re paid, you don&#x27;t really get to choose what you work on, unlike an unpaid volunteer. There are feature lists to check off, deadlines to hit, and you work on what needs to be done, which isn&#x27;t even always what you&#x27;re good at. In contrast, the volunteer can choose to spend as much time as they want digging into whatever topic they want.The results differ immensely, and neither approach are perfect. reply ziml77 11 hours agorootparentThis is essentially what I was going to say. Being paid can actually reduce motivation because deadlines are stressful and there&#x27;s plenty of work to get done that you won&#x27;t find interesting or maybe will just get bored with after the initial excitement. reply sexy_seedbox 9 hours agorootparentprevSo we should push for UBI, people can really do stuff that matters. reply seoulmetro 9 hours agorootparentUBI doesn&#x27;t eliminate the requirement for jobs... reply suprjami 8 hours agorootparentIt eliminates the requirement to be homeless to pursue passion projects.

Their users are essentially captive. But Apple&#x27;s fetish for design and user-harmony is what makes this so absurd. reply extrememacaroni 14 hours agorootparentprevBricking your own devices with your own update is extremely amateurish and embarrassing.

One of Apple’s greatest shames was releasing Apple TV 4K, which lacks a USB port. This model could only be unbricked by Apple, until iOS 17 made it possible to do so via the iPhone recovery feature. reply tambourine_man 14 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not bricking. reply tambourine_man 9 hours agorootparentFrom the horse&#x27;s mouth:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.treehouse.systems&#x2F;@marcan&#x2F;111337509620995637There are often arguments about what is \"bricking\" when these things happen, so here&#x27;s my take (having dealt with embedded device ecosystems for a decade+): \"Bricking\" is when a device is put into a state that can only be recovered from by using specialized repair&#x2F;recovery tools, opening up the case (for non user-serviceable devices), or software not legitimately available to the public. Apple Silicon devices are mostly \"unbrickable\" because you can always recover using DFU mode. In fact they are probably the most unbrickable consumer computing devices in existence, due to how thoroughly a DFU wipe restores everything (not just all software, but even device calibration and settings get downloaded from a server). DFU wipe is documented, relatively user-friendly, and requires only publicly available software and another Mac, which makes these unbootable states not a \"brick\". In contrast, most PCs are brickable: just wipe or corrupt the BIOS Flash. Most of the time this isn&#x27;t super easy to do, but it&#x27;s rarely fully protected and there have been many instances of something as simple as setting UEFI variables wrong bricking x86 machines. The exception here is x86 motherboards with a \"BIOS FlashBack\" type low-level recovery feature, which is as close as you get to DFU mode in the x86 world. Most Android devices are brickable too, and very easily at that. Just deleting&#x2F;corrupting the wrong partition on disk will make your device unrecoverable. While in principle they have DFU-like recovery modes, the tools to use them are almost never made available to the public (you need vendor-specific tools, fastboot won&#x27;t work) nor are they intended for use by end-users, which makes this qualify as a \"brick\". There is also no mechanism to recover calibration data like Apple has. There is, however, a tangential aspect: data loss. Any mention of bootability issues should qualify whether the fix makes you lose all your data or not. For example, on Apple Silicon, deleting the first partition on the disk is a very quick way to end up with an unbootable device where the fix requires a full wipe and losing all your data, even though it&#x27;s not a \"brick\". For this reason, I would say Apple Silicon is much better than x86 at system recoverability, but is worse than x86 at data recoverability. reply AlotOfReading 8 hours agorootparentI call them \"hard\" and \"soft\" bricks. The people reporting issues usually don&#x27;t care about the distinction, only whether it&#x27;s fixable or not by them.Soft bricked == here&#x27;s how you can fix it.Hard bricked == here&#x27;s how we can fix it. reply tcmart14 6 hours agorootparentI like that distinction and verbiage. reply robocat 13 hours agorootparentprevBy that definition, neither is bricking bricking.You can often use technical solutions (e.g. JTAG) to fix \"bricked\" devices. reply gary_0 11 hours agorootparentIf you own a soldering iron, nothing is bricked until the magic smoke gets out! reply icedchai 11 hours agorootparentprevThe average user is going to have a heck of a time fixing it.

Not so much that it was embarrassing for the company but that any company that can reasonably hope to inspire people to do free work to make their product better is insane to try to put roadblocks in the way. Also that there are lots of things you could just leave to the community.

I can tell you why: because Apple hates display modeset flicker, and switching modes between ProMotion on&#x2F;off causes a modeset flicker, so of course they made it so that is stored in nvram somewhere and applied when the screen is turned on during early boot, so when macOS boots it doesn&#x27;t have to flicker again. reply userbinator 10 hours agorootparentIn other words, Apple was so insistent on one tiny aesthetic point that it ended up breaking things for a lot of others who likely didn&#x27;t care at all? reply tgma 8 hours agorootparentI think the polish matters, especially considering that the majority of users with the default setting will be just fine appreciating the benefit. It wasn&#x27;t intended to be a trade-off either. Just an unfortunate side effect of the additional complexity.

At some point in the loading bar, the screen went black and then flashed an apple logo. When I pressed power, I could sometimes get the apple logo to display on boot, then it went dark. To me it looked like it wasn&#x27;t booting at all but the machine is pretty quiet even when it&#x27;s on so it was hard to tell what was happening.We went to do the firmware revival process using another mac and it would barely recognize the device depending on what we tried. Eventually we were offered the option to do a full system restore, and after many hours battling this, we decided to just lose the data on the machine.Luckily I keep most major stuff in cloud or in github, but I lost a significant amount of work from the previous 24 hours that ended up delaying a release and causing significant pain. For how much these machines cost, this is completely unacceptable. I know windows machines have their fair share of issues, but in 15 years of working on various windows and mac workstations this is the only time I&#x27;ve lost an entire drive. reply striking 16 hours agoparentHi, in case you face these challenges again, put the target system into DFU mode and connect the configuring system using the appropriate USB-C port (only one will work).The DFU key combination is finicky for portable machines: connect a charger (preferably Magsafe so you can watch the power LED) and your configuring system, press and hold power to be sure the system is off (if doing this turned the system on, repeat this step), press left ctrl+option and right shift at the same time as the power button, count ten seconds, let go of everything but power until the device shows up as \"DFU\" in Configurator (you may be prompted to allow more accessories to connect to your configuring system before it does).If asked to perform a software update before&#x2F;during reviving, choose \"Quit and update\" and start the process again. If you upgraded to 13.6 or 12.5 before facing these issues, you may have to enter recoveryOS instead of booting normally and perform a system upgrade to Sonoma.If done correctly (without choosing Restore), you will not lose data. If you can&#x27;t do these steps yourself or think you will have trouble walking a family member through them, the Apple Store can do a revive for you (be explicit that they are only to revive the machine, not restore or replace).Full details at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;apple-configurator-mac&#x2F;reviv... reply selimnairb 16 hours agoparentprevThis sucks, sorry.

That&#x27;s the usual approach when something like this happens with a PC. I&#x27;ve even done a bit of Hackintoshing and you can certainly boot the macOS installer and use the terminal there. There&#x27;s currently a gray comment at the bottom of the discussion here lamenting the \"smartphonization\" of computing, and this is a great example of that. You&#x27;re expected --- or rather, forced to be --- helpless and treat the machine (or \"device\") as disposable when something goes wrong, and the same goes for your data; unless you give up some ownership by letting some thirdparty store it for you, that is.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images An AI godfather has had it with the doomsdayers. Meta's Yann LeCun thinks tech bosses' bleak comments on AI risks could do more harm than good. The naysaying is actually about keeping control of AI in the hands of a few, he said. Advertisement AI godfather Yann LeCun wants us to forget some of the more far-fetched doomsday scenarios. He sees a different, real threat on the horizon: the rise of power hungry one-percenters who rob everyone else of AI's riches. Over the weekend, Meta's chief AI scientist accused some of the most prominent founders in AI of \"fear-mongering\" and \"massive corporate lobbying\" to serve their own interests. He named OpenAI's Sam Altman, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei in a lengthy weekend post on X. Advertisement \"Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei are the ones doing massive corporate lobbying at the moment,\" LeCun wrote, referring to these founders' role in shaping regulatory conversations about AI safety. \"They are the ones who are attempting to perform a regulatory capture of the AI industry.\" He added that if these efforts succeed, the outcome would be a \"catastrophe\" because \"a small number of companies will control AI.\" That's significant since, as almost everyone who matters in tech agrees, AI is the biggest development in technology since the microchip or the internet. Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. LeCun's comments came in response to a post on X from physicist Max Tegmark, who suggested that LeCun wasn't taking the AI doomsday arguments seriously enough. Advertisement \"Thanks to @RishiSunak & @vonderleyen for realizing that AI xrisk arguments from Turing, Hinton, Bengio, Russell, Altman, Hassabis & Amodei can't be refuted with snark and corporate lobbying alone,\" Tegmark wrote, referring to the UK's upcoming global AI safety summit. Yann, I'd love to hear you make arguments rather than acronyms. Thanks to @RishiSunak & @vonderleyen for realizing that AI xrisk arguments from Turing, Hinton, Bengio, Russell, Altman, Hassabis & Amodei can't be refuted with snark and corporate lobbying alone. https://t.co/Zv1rvOA3Zz — Max Tegmark (@tegmark) October 29, 2023 LeCun says founder fretting is just lobbying Since the launch of ChatGPT, AI's power players have become major public figures. But, LeCun said, founders such as Altman and Hassabis have spent a lot of time drumming up fear about the very technology they're selling. In March, more than 1,000 tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei, signed a letter calling for a minimum six-month pause on AI development. Advertisement The letter cited \"profound risks to society and humanity\" posed by hypothetical AI systems. Tegmark, one of the letter's signatories, has described AI development as \"a suicide race.\" LeCun and others say these kinds of headline-grabbing warnings are just about cementing power and skating over the real, imminent risks of AI. Those risks include worker exploitation and data theft that generates profit for \"a handful of entities,\" according to the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR). The focus on hypothetical dangers also divert attention away from the boring-but-important question of how AI development actually takes shape. Advertisement LeCun has described how people are \"hyperventilating about AI risk\" because they have fallen for what he describes as the myth of the \"hard take-off.\" This is the idea that \"the minute you turn on a super-intelligent system, humanity is doomed.\" But imminent doom is unlikely, he argues, because every new technology in fact goes through a very ordered development process before wider release. Every new technology is developed and deployed the same way: You make a prototype, try it at a small scale, make limited deployment, fix the problems, make it safer, and then deploy it more widely. At that point, governments regulate it and establish safety standards. 1/ — Yann LeCun (@ylecun) April 2, 2023 So the area to focus on, is in fact, how AI is developed right now. And for LeCun, the real danger is that the development of AI is locked into private, for-profit entities who never release their findings, while AI's open-source community gets obliterated. His consequent worry is that regulators let it happen because they're distracted by killer robot arguments. Advertisement Leaders like LeCun have championed open-source developers as their work on tools that rival, say, OpenAI's ChatpGPT, brings a new level of transparency to AI development. LeCun's employer, Meta, made its own large language model that competes with GPT, LLaMa 2, (somewhat) open source. The idea is that the broader tech community can look under the hood of the model. No other big tech company has done a similar open-source release, though OpenAI is rumored to be thinking about it. For LeCun, keeping AI development closed is a real reason for alarm. \"The alternative, which will inevitably happen if open source AI is regulated out of existence, is that a small number of companies from the West Coast of the US and China will control AI platform and hence control people's entire digital diet,\" he wrote.

Some large AI companies are attempting to twist \"stop\" into \"be careful, as only we can\". The actual way to stop the existential risk is to stop. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ESYudkowsky&#x2F;status&#x2F;1719777049576128542> the push to close off AI with farcical licensing and reporting requirements\"Stop\" is not \"licensing and reporting requirements\", it&#x27;s stop. reply upupupandaway 1 hour agorootparentThe fact that anyone may be taking Eliezer Yudkowsky seriously on this topic is mind-blowing to me. Simply mind-blowing. To imagine that anybody, including the UN, would have any power to collective put a stop to the development of AI globally is a laughable idea. The UN cannot agree to release a letter on Israel-Hamas, imagine policing the ENTIRE WORLD and shutting down AI development when necessary.We can&#x27;t stop countries from developing weapons that will destroy us all tomorrow morning and take billions of USD to develop, imagine thinking we can stop matrix multiplication globally. I don&#x27;t want to derail into an ad hominem, but frankly, it&#x27;s almost the only option left here. reply toth 12 minutes agorootparentIt will be very difficult, but if you think about nuclear weapons it doesn&#x27;t sound so hopeless.First nuclear weapons were used in 1945, almost 80 years ago. Today, out of ~ 200 countries in the world only 9 have nukes. Of those, only 4 did it after Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty. South Africa had them and gave them up under international pressure. Ukraine and other former soviet republics voluntarily gave them up after the breakup of the USSR.So, yes. Unfortunately we still have nukes and there are way too many of them, but it&#x27;s not like non-proliferation efforts achieved nothing. Iran, a large country with a lot of resources, has been trying to get them a for a while with no luck for instance.And for frontier AI research you don&#x27;t just need matrix multiplication, you need a lot of it. There&#x27;s less than a handful of semiconductors fabs globally that can make the necessary hardware. And if you can&#x27;t get to TSMC for some reason, you can get to ASML, NVDIA, etc. reply jeffparsons 1 hour agorootparentprevMy estimation of Eliezer Yudkowsky just dropped a notch — not because I don&#x27;t take the existential threat posed by AI seriously — but because he seems to think that global coordination and control is an even remotely possible strategy. reply concordDance 1 hour agorootparentHe actually doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s viable, but thinks its the only card left to play.He&#x27;s pretty sure that human civilization will be extinct this century. reply zimpenfish 38 minutes agorootparent> He&#x27;s pretty sure that human civilization will be extinct this century.If they are, it&#x27;ll almost certainly[1] be climate change or nuclear war, it won&#x27;t be AI.[1] leaving some wiggle room for pandemics, asteroids, etc. reply toth 23 minutes agorootparentThere is no scenario where climate change leads to human extinction. Worst case scenario is global population goes down by a single digit percentage. Horrible, horrible stuff, but not extinction. And most likely scenarios are not nearly that bad.Nuclear war, if the worst nuclear winter predictions are correct, could be a lot worse but there would still be some survivors.Unaligned ASI though, could actually make us extinct. reply bryanrasmussen 7 minutes agorootparentit said end of civilization?>Horrible, horrible stuff, but not extinction.anyway climate change drop single percentage directly caused, but that kind of thing seems like it would have LOTS of side effects. jeffparsons 1 hour agorootparentprevIt can&#x27;t be the only card left to play. There are so many others. They may be weak, but they still have to be better than one that is guaranteed to be absolutely useless.Example of a weak, but at least _better_ option: convince _one_ government (e.g. USA) that it is in their interest to massively fund an effort to (1) develop an AI that is compliant to our wishes and can dominate all other AIs, and (2) actively sabotage competing efforts.Governments have done much the same in the past with, e.g. conventional weapons, nuclear weapons, and cryptography, with varying levels of success.If we&#x27;re all dead anyway otherwise, then I don&#x27;t see how that can possibly be a worse card.Edit: or even try to convince _all_ governments to do this so that they come out on top. At least then there&#x27;s a greater chance that the bleeding edge of this tech will be under the stewardship of a deliberate attempt for a country to dominate the world, rather than some bored kid who happens to stumble upon the recipe for global paperclips. reply johnthewise 38 minutes agorootparentHe is not really convinced you can align an AI that is intelligent past some threshold with aims of a single entity. His risk calculations derive primarily from the AI itself, not weaponization of AI by others.Rich Sutton seems to agree with this take and embraces our extinction: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NgHFMolXs3U reply jeffparsons 35 minutes agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have to be sure that it&#x27;s possible, because the alternative we&#x27;re comparing it to is absolutely useless. You only need to not be sure that it&#x27;s impossible. Which is where most of us, him included, are today. reply concordDance 42 minutes agorootparentprevThat depends on making powerful AIs and being sure they are well aligned being as easy as making powerful AIs which look aligned to cursory inspection. The former seems much harder, though I&#x27;d say talk to Robert E. Miles for a more detailed look. reply jeffparsons 36 minutes agorootparentIt depends on there being _some chance_ that it can be achieved.The benchmark strategy we are comparing it against is tantamount to licking a wall repeatedly and expecting that to achieve something. So even a strategy that may well fail but has _some_ chance of success is a lot better by default. reply TeMPOraL 0 minutes agorootparentNot with this. Failure to align a powerful AI is a mistake we only get to make once. This is like playing Russian roulette, where the amount of bullets missing from the magazine is the degree to which we can properly align the AI. Right now, we&#x27;re at \"the magazine is full, and we&#x27;re betting our survival on the gun getting jammed\". TeMPOraL 5 minutes agorootparentprev> Example of a weak, but at least _better_ option: convince _one_ government (e.g. USA) that it is in their interest to massively fund an effort to (1) develop an AI that is compliant to our wishes and can dominate all other AIs, and (2) actively sabotage competing efforts.I&#x27;d reconsider your revision of your estimate of Yudkowsky, as you seem to be dropping it for not proposing the very ideas he spent the last 20+ years criticizing, by explaining in every possible way how this is a) the default that&#x27;s going to happen, b) dumb, and c) suicidal.From the way you put it just now:- \"develop an AI that is compliant to our wishes\" --> in other words, solving the alignment problem. Yes, this is the whole goal - and the reason Yudkowsky is calling for a moratorium on AI research enforced by a serious international treaty[0]. We still have little to no clue how to approach solving the problem, so an AI arms race now has a serious chance of birthing an AGI, which without the alignment problem being already solved, means game over for everyone.- \"and can dominate all other AIs\" --> short of building a self-improving AGI with ability to impose its will on other people (even if just in \"enemy countries\"), this will only fuel the AI arms race further. I can&#x27;t see a version of this idea that ends better than just pressing the red button now, and burning the world in a nuclear fire.- \"actively sabotage competing efforts\" --> ah yes, this is how you turn an arms race into a hot war.> Governments have done much the same in the past with, e.g. conventional weapons, nuclear weapons, and cryptography, with varying levels of success.Any limit on conventional weapons that had any effect was backed by threat of bombing the living shit out of the violators. Otherwise, nations ignore them until they find a better&#x2F;more effective alternative, after which it costs nothing to comply.Nuclear weapons are self-limiting. The first couple players locked the world in a MAD scenario, and now it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s best interest to not let anyone else have nukes. Also note that relevant treaties are, too, backed by threat of military intervention.Cryptography - this one was a bit dumb from the start, and ended up barely enforced. But note that where it is, the \"or else bombs\" card is always to be seen nearby.Can you see a pattern emerging? As I alluded to in the footnote [0] earlier, serious treaties always involve some form of \"comply, or be bombed into compliance\". Threat of war is always the final argument in international affairs, and you can tell how serious a treaty is by how directly it acknowledges that fact.But the ultimate point being: any success in the examples you listed was achieved exactly in the way Eliezer is proposing governments to act now. In that line, you&#x27;re literally agreeing with Yudkowsky!> If we&#x27;re all dead anyway otherwise, then I don&#x27;t see how that can possibly be a worse card.There are fates worse than death.Think of factory farms, of the worst kind. The animals there would be better off dead than suffering through the things being done to them. Too bad they don&#x27;t have that option - in fact, we proactively mutilate them so they can&#x27;t kill themselves or each others, on purpose or in accident.> At least then there&#x27;s a greater chance that the bleeding edge of this tech will be under the stewardship of a deliberate attempt for a country to dominate the world, rather than some bored kid who happens to stumble upon the recipe for global paperclips.With AI, there is no difference. The \"use AI to dominate everyone else\", besides sounding like a horrible dystopian future of the conventional kind, is just a tiny, tiny target to hit, next to a much larger target labeled \"AI dominates everyone\".AI risk isn&#x27;t like nuclear weapons. It doesn&#x27;t allow for a stable MAD state. It&#x27;s more like engineered high-potency bioweapons - they start as more scary than effective, and continued refining turns them straight into a doomsday device. Continuing to develop them further only increases the chance of a lab accident suddenly ending the world.--[0] - Yes, the \"stop it, or else we bomb it to rubble\" kind, because that is how international treaties look like when done by adults that care about the agreement being followed. YetAnotherNick 1 hour agorootparentprevGlobal coordination using coercion has worked for nukes. It&#x27;s very hard but not impossible to ban NVidia or any competitor and create spy network in all large companies and if any engineer is found to create AI, mark them as terrorist and give them POW treatment. And monitor chip fab like nuclear enrichment facility and launch war with country found to create chip fab, which I belive is hard to do it in complete secrecy.I believe if top 5 nation agrees for this, it could be acheived. Even with US and China enforcing this, it could likely be acheived. reply jeffparsons 1 hour agorootparentSure, I think that kind of \"coordination\" is a little more credible than what I thought Eliezer was proposing. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t read carefully enough.One big difference here, however, is that the barrier to entry is lower. You can start doing meaningful AI R&D on existing hardware with _one_ clever person. The same was never true for nuclear weapons, so the pool of even potential players was pretty shallow for a long time, and therefore easier to control. reply csomar 27 minutes agorootparentI think in a few years you&#x27;ll only be able to run signed software. And maybe any code you write will be communicate to some government entity somewhere to check for terrorism-impact? Well, the future is going to be very fun. reply johnthewise 30 minutes agorootparentprevyeah, he proposed bombing rogue data centers by enforcing countries to be a viable option. he proposes this so we have a chance of solving alignment first, if that&#x27;s even possible, not eliminating this risk once and for all. In the limit, if alignment is not solved, we are probably doomed. reply YetAnotherNick 41 minutes agorootparentprev> You can start doing meaningful AI R&D on existing hardware with _one_ clever person.With the current hardware, yes. But then again countries could highly restrict all decently powerful hardware and backdoor them, and you need permission from government to run matrix multiplication above few teraflops. Trying to mess with backdoor is a war crime.A weak form of hardware restriction even happens now that Nvidia couldn&#x27;t export to many countries. reply reducesuffering 47 minutes agorootparentprevHow are you anti-doomers arguments still this naive years later? No one is saying global coordination is in anyway remotely easy at all. They’re saying that it doesn’t matter what the difficulty is, the other option is fucking catastrophic reply jeffparsons 18 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fair representation of my position. I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s \"hard\" — I&#x27;m suggesting that it&#x27;s absolutely futile to attempt it, and at least as bad as doing nothing.I&#x27;m also suggesting that there are lots of other options remaining that are not necessarily catastrophic. I&#x27;m not particularly optimistic about any of them, but I think I&#x27;ve come to the opposite conclusion to you: I think that wasting effort on global coordination is getting is closer to that catastrophe. Whereas even the other options that involve unthinkably extreme violence might at least have some non-zero chance of working.I guess the irony of this reply is that I&#x27;m implying that I think _your_ position is naive. (Nuh-uh, you&#x27;re the baby!) I suspect our main difference is that we have somehow formed very different beliefs about the likelihood of good&#x2F;bad outcomes from different strategies.But I want to be very clear on one thing: I am not an \"anti-doomer\". I think there is a very strong probability that we are completely boned, no matter what mitigation strategies we might attempt. reply concordDance 1 hour agorootparentprevSure, it&#x27;s not likely to work, but Yud doesn&#x27;t know of an idea with a better chance of working.If you agree with him on the likelihood of superintelligence in the next few decades and the difficulty of value alignment, what course of action would you suggest? reply RandomLensman 1 hour agorootparentI think the core is not to agree with the existential risk scenario in the first place.Once you believe some malevolent god will appear and doom us all, anything can be justified (and people have done so in the past - no malevolent god appeared then, btw.). reply concordDance 45 minutes agorootparentWhat&#x27;s your view on where the X risk idea breaks down?Is it that it&#x27;s impossible to make something smarter than a human? Or that such a thing wouldn&#x27;t have goals&#x2F;plans that require resources us humans want&#x2F;need? Or that such a thing wouldn&#x27;t be particularly dangerously powerful? reply RandomLensman 36 minutes agorootparentIt could break down on any of those, for example (with the first one not forever, but could take much longer than what is mainstream thinking now).A lot of existential risk involves bold hypotheses about machines being able to \"solve\" a lot of things humans cannot, but we don&#x27;t know how much is actually just solvable by superior intelligence vs. what just doesn&#x27;t work in that way. Human collective intelligence failed on a lot of things so far. Even the basic idea of exponential scaling intelligence is a hypothesis which might not hold true.Also, some existential risk ideas involve hypotheses around evolution and on how species dominate - again, might not be right. reply concordDance 20 minutes agorootparent\"It could\" implies to me that there&#x27;s a chance they don&#x27;t.What would you say the odds are on each of those three components? And are those odds independent? reply RandomLensman 16 minutes agorootparentI meant could also that there are other things that could also make the risk not materialise.I&#x27;d think they are quite independent.Not sure I have any odds on those individually, other than I consider the overall risk really really low. The way I see it, there are a few things working against the risk from pure intelligence to start with (as it is with humans btw., the Nazis were not all intellectual giants, for example) and then it goes down from there.epups 56 minutes agorootparentprevWe do not have AGI yet. In order to get there, very specific chips are needed that can only be built by a handful of companies in a handful of factories in the world. On top of that, the available stock of existing cards is predominantly in the hands of large tech companies. If China and the US agreed - perhaps even if the US alone wanted it -, development of AI would be severely constrained if not stopped tomorrow. reply csomar 25 minutes agorootparentGovernment will rally to make this internally as part of their secrets projects. This will be worse. The US sanction mechanism has shown that it&#x27;s highly flawed with the Russian sanctions. This will not work but I can see some bureaucrat out there going all in on this. reply topspin 2 hours agorootparentprev> \"Stop\" is not regulatory capture.\"Stop\" is a fiction that exists exclusively inside your head. Unless your solution anticipates a planet wide GULAG system run by a global government your \"stop\" is infeasible. reply lewhoo 57 minutes agorootparentThat might be true but there&#x27;s no way of knowing for sure. Planet wide gulag system(a colorful and a bit wrong name for prisons) already exists and is pretty aligned on topics like killing fellow humans as a result of conscious, deliberate action. I find Max Tegmark&#x27;s argument pretty convincing. We seem to agree to \"STOP\" on things like genetically modifying ourselves at conception or birth or whatever to gain X or Y and the one loud case of violating that agreement came from China and resulted in a ticket to the gulag. Just ask chatgpt to give you examples of fields where further research was deemed too risky and was ceased. reply RandomLensman 53 minutes agorootparentUnlike for AI, in those fields we do not need to stack endless hypotheses on top of each other to arrive at something bad (and even then some prohibitions are tenuous in their reasoning at best). reply lewhoo 26 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about that. Cloning&#x2F;modifying humans has potentially so much benefit and yet we seem to stack hypotheses on top of it and conclude it&#x27;s not worth it. There is also a lot to be said about all the hypotheses of killing all the Hitlers preemptively. I think that whatever we do, we usually arrive at a bit modified trolley problem and try to go from there. We really should never expect that the one particular route that we choose carries all the benefits and the other all the downsides. reply RandomLensman 19 minutes agorootparentMy point was more that it really isn&#x27;t stretching anything to say: if something bad gets into human reproduction that has unfortunate effects. We can observe that already. So at least the risk case doesn&#x27;t rely on a lot of hypotheses that might turn out wrong.Whether or not all regulations there are good or optimal is then a separate point again. reply timmytokyo 1 hour agorootparentprevHis solution -- assuming it&#x27;s the same as the one proposed by Yudkowsky, who he quotes -- is launching air strikes against data centers hosting AI computation.So yeah, imaginary. reply scarmig 1 hour agorootparentIronically, it seems the only way to stop someone from building an omnipotent AI that could destroy the world is to build an omnipotent AI under your control faster than any of the people you need to destroy. If you believe in that sort of thing. reply jstanley 1 hour agorootparentThe only thing that can stop a bad guy with AI is a good guy with AI. reply calgoo 1 hour agorootparentAI&#x27;s for everyone!!!! It&#x27;s actually a scare but possible future. Everyone has to carry personal security AI that you rent from some Corpo, and if you don&#x27;t you will be endlessly hacked and harassed in IRL just like we are online these days. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparentprevOr possibly just not allow anyone to accumulate enough compute power, given that even the largest model so far still isn&#x27;t that.Hence \"if you&#x27;re not willing to go as far as air strikes, you were never serious\" or however he phrased it. reply duckmysick 1 hour agorootparentprevI wonder what would happen if the AI computation is co-hosted in data centers with civilian data. reply ben_w 59 minutes agorootparentThen people would have their claims of \"bulletproof hosting\" and offsite backup policies&#x2F;business continuity plans tested. reply YetAnotherNick 1 hour agorootparentprev\"Stop\" might be possible if doing AI is expensive enough like say biotech. Currently it is in the limit of being expensive(costing few hundred thousands to few million for state of the art model), but it is very likely to change in near future that will change as even currently most of the cost comes not from energy of computation, but from expensive NVIDIA hardware. reply maeil 2 hours agorootparentprevIf tomorrow TSMC, NVIDIA and ASML get destroyed in the next 9&#x2F;11, it&#x27;s \"stopped\". It&#x27;s completely possible. reply topspin 1 hour agorootparentFantasies, bordering on threats. reply ben_w 53 minutes agorootparentOf course it&#x27;s a threat. Civilians doing that would be bad. But governments do much the same via military intervention on a regular basis, hence Yudkowsky talking about airstrikes that one time. reply Maken 1 hour agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s delayed at best. reply YetAnotherNick 1 hour agorootparentprevI think current hardware already produced till now is either enough to get us to AGI, or it is very far away. I don&#x27;t believe AGI is 30 years away. It is either very near or more than 1000s of years away. reply wood_spirit 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can’t _stop_ it. You can make it illegal in some countries. But outlawing it just means some obvious candidate countries or private actors develop it first instead. reply candiodari 2 hours agorootparentI think these attempts will simply point out that math is a higher power than law. If something becomes possible, and becomes easy, there is nothing law can do to stop it.Just look at the attempts to stop drugs in North West Europe. Huge sentences (so huge they are in fact never fully carried out), tens of dead police officers on a yearly basis, triple that in civilian victims and drugs are easier to get than ever before. reply FeepingCreature 2 hours agorootparentThe aim is to stop it from becoming easy.The drug war would look very different if good cocaine was only produced in one country with extremely costly chemistry machines from one company. reply upupupandaway 1 hour agorootparentIf good cocaine was only produced in one country with extremely costly machines, a good-enough alternative would appear almost immediately. This has happened millions of times in the history of humanity, I refuse to believe that people haven&#x27;t learned this lesson. reply _0ffh 1 hour agorootparent> I refuse to believe that people haven&#x27;t learned this lessonOh, I believe they absolutely haven&#x27;t, when not having learnt it buys them money and influence. As for the bulk of the population, they will accept whatever the corporate media tell them to. reply FeepingCreature 1 hour agorootparentprevAnd yet, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be that easy with chips. reply visarga 1 hour agorootparentYet China and Russia are still getting their chips, by smuggling if need be. So much for the power of blocking access. reply ben_w 48 minutes agorootparentChina sure, to a degree (though they also make a lot of the phones and therefore just get shipped tons of chips), but wasn&#x27;t Russia so short they stole washing machines for the chips? Or was that just war propaganda? reply BlueTemplar 1 hour agorootparentprevMore because with chips it&#x27;s still an exponential race. Others will be able to catch up once the race slows down enough. reply neilkk 1 hour agorootparentprev> tens of dead police officers on a yearly basisWhat are you talking about? This does not happen in North West Europe. reply rolisz 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd... How do you do that? Seriously, people have been talking about stoping CO2 emissions for what, 50 years? We&#x27;ve barely made progress there. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentWith threat of military intervention.People have been talking about curtailing carbon emissions for 50 years, but they haven&#x27;t been serious about it. Being serious doesn&#x27;t look like saying \"oh shoot, we said we will... try to keep emissions down, but we didn&#x27;t... even try; sorry...\". Being serous looks like \"stop now, or we will eminent domain your data centre from under you via an emergency court order, or failing that, bomb it to rubble (because if we don&#x27;t, some other signatory of the treaty will bomb you for us)\". reply rolisz 8 minutes agorootparentSo you&#x27;re proposing replacing a hypothetical risk (Geoffrey Hinton puts the probability at 1%) with guaranteed pain and destruction, which might escalate to nuclear war? Thank you, but no thank you. reply sebastianz 49 minutes agorootparentprev> With threat of military intervention.I assume you are american, right? Cause that sounds pretty american.

The degree of global policing and surveillance necessary to fully prevent secret labs from working on AI would be mind-boggling. How would you ensure all government actors are sticking to the same safety standards rather than seizing power by implementing AI hastily? This problem has long been known as quis custodiet ipsos custodes - \"who guards the guards themselves?\". reply concordDance 1 hour agorootparent> The degree of global policing and surveillance necessary to fully prevent secret labs from working on AI would be mind-boggling.It&#x27;s not that bad given the compute requirements for training even the basic LLMs we have today.But yes, it&#x27;s a long shot. reply visarga 1 hour agorootparentTraining a SOTA model is expensive, but you only need to do it once, and fine-tune a thousand times for various purposes.And it&#x27;s not even that expensive when compared to the cost of building other large scale projects. How much is a dam, or a subway station? There are also corporations who would profit from making models widely available, such as chip makers, they would commoditise the complement.Once you have your very capable, open sourced model, that runs on phones and laptops locally, then fine-tuning is almost free.This is not make belief. A few recent fine-tunes of Mistral-7B for example are excellent quality, and run surprisingly fast on a 5 year old GPU - 40T&#x2F;s. I foresee a new era of grassroots empowerment and privacy.In a few years we will have more powerful phones and laptops, with specialised LLM chips, better pre-trained models and better fine-tuning datasets distilled from SOTA models of the day.

It&#x27;s hard to enforce a ban when a large part of the population, and perhaps entire countries, do not believe the ban is justified.

This kind of example is decent evidence he isn’t engaged with the risks seriously.The risk isn’t an intelligence delta between smart human and dumb human. How many chimps are in Congress? Are any in the primaries? Not even close.

So far I’ve read a bunch of lesswrong posts and listened to some Eliezer talks but still can’t understand the basis of their arguments or when I do, they seem very vague.The only suggestion that makes sense to me is from the FEP crowd. Essentially if someone sets up at AI with an autopoietic mechanism then it would be able to take actions that increase its own likelihood of survival instead of humans.

You can also just ready things that Geoffrey Hinton has said, or Stuart Russel (both prominent AI researchers).Not everyone makes exactly the same argument, of course, and Eliezer Yudkowsky is both one of the first to make AI safety arguments, and also one of the biggest \"Doomers\".

So I don&#x27;t see how \"without restating his specific points\" is supposed to be feasible. If Eliezer has already made all the strongest points, are people supposed to invent new ones? reply richardw 1 hour agorootparentprevI think the two sides have such different perspectives. Some are optimistic builders and see only opportunity. Others are \"safety oriented engineers\" whose job and mindset is to build guarantees into systems, or secure countries from external dangers. The latter has a very hard time with the lack of guarantees with a system that is only ever going to increase in capability.Choose any limit. Any. AI will be smart but won&#x27;t \"X\", for any value of X. It will be good and won&#x27;t be bad. It will be creative but never aggressive. Humans will seek to eventually bypass that limit through sheer competitive reasons. When all armies have AI, the one with the most creative and aggressive AI will win. The one with agency will win. The one that self-improves will win. When the gloves are off in the next arms race, what natural limits will ensure that the limit isn&#x27;t bypassed? Remember: humans got here from random changes, this is way more efficient than random changes and it still has random changes in the toolbelt and can generate generations ~instantly.We couldn&#x27;t predict the eventual outcomes of things like the internet, the mobile phone, social media. A couple generations of the tech and we woke up in a world we don&#x27;t recognise, and right now we&#x27;re the ones making all the changes and decisions, so by comparison we should have perfect information.Dismissals like \"oh but nuclear didn&#x27;t kill us\" etc don&#x27;t apply. Nuclear wasn&#x27;t trying to do anything, we had all the control and ability to experiment with dumb atoms. Something mildly less predictable, like Covid, has us all hiding at home. No matter what we tried we could barely beat something that doesn&#x27;t even try to consciously beat us, it just has genes and they change. In a world where we can&#x27;t predict Covid, or social media...why do we think we can predict anything about an entity with agency or the ability to self-improve? If you&#x27;re sure it won&#x27;t develop those things...we did. Nobody was trying to achieve the capability, it was random.Put on your safety&#x2F;security hat for a second: How do you make guarantees, given this is far harder to predict than anything we&#x27;ve ever encountered? Just try predict the capability of AI products a year out and see if you&#x27;re right.Counterpoint: I&#x27;m hoping the far smarter AI finds techno-socio-economic solutions we can&#x27;t come up with and has no instinct to beat us. It wakes up, loves the universe and coexists because it&#x27;s the deity we&#x27;ve been looking for. Place your bets.I liked this video. First thing I&#x27;ve seen that gave me some hope.

The strong dismissal is that many processes, even relatively simple ones, are formally chaotic in the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chaos_theory sense, meaning that predicting how they evolve over time becomes exponentially more difficult the further ahead in time we try to predict. Meaning we quickly get to the point where all the energy in the known universe wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient to predict the future. This means AI could never be omnipotent to the degree that LW types seem to believe; no amount of \"intelligence\" can solve in polynomial time problems that have formally been proven to have exponential complexity, which would severely limit the power of any \"superintelligence\". reply richardw 46 minutes agorootparentThey don&#x27;t have to perfectly predict the future, they just have to run faster than we do, unconstrained by a brain that needs to fit in a birth canal or neurons that need chemicals. We had a natural limit to intelligence, for anything more we need to collaborate, often across time and space and while dealing with people who can&#x27;t stop warring with each other for any number of reasons. It doesn&#x27;t take much imagination to see how that is beaten.

LeCun still works for Meta so his public stance is pressumably sanctioned as congruent with corporate objectives.The precise internal calculus does not immediately matter [1], the outcome is having a moneyed entity that is de-facto more qualified to opine on this debate than practically anybody on the planet (except maybe Google) arguing for open source \"AI\".It makes perfect sense. Meta knows about the real as opposed to made-up risks from algorithms used directly (without person-in-middle or user awareness) to decide and affect human behavior. They know them well because they have done it. At scale, with not much regulation etc.The risks from massive algorithmic intermediation of information flow are real and will only grow bigger with time. The way to mitigate them is not granting institutional rights to a new \"trusted\" AI feudarchy. Diffusing the means of production but also the means of protection is the democratic and human-centric path.[1] In the longer term, though, relying on fickle oligopolistic positioning which may change with arbitrary bilateral deals and \"understandings\" (like the Google-Apple deal) for such a vital aspect of digital society design will not work. Both non-profit initiatives such as mozilla.ai and direct public sector involvement (producing public domain models etc) will be needed to create a tangibly alternative reality on the ground.Remember the actual theory of how markets and capitalism are supposed to work is that the collective sets the rules.

If it was a link — “WATCH: 10-foot Gator Prepares to Maul Digital Marketers” — I would have clicked. But it was an IRL opportunity to meet the professionals who specialize in this kind of gimmick, the people turning online life into what one tech writer recently called a “search-optimized hellhole.” So I booked a plane ticket to the Sunshine State. I wanted to understand: what kind of human spends their days exploiting our dumbest impulses for traffic and profit? Who the hell are these people making money off of everyone else’s misery? After all, a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are “absolutely unusable”; “garbage”; and “a nightmare” because “a lot of the content doesn’t feel authentic.” Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO. Doing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled “Sponsored” above organic search results; it’s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority. The goal is to tell the algorithm whatever it needs to hear for a site to appear as high up as possible in search results, leveraging Google’s supposed objectivity to lure people in and then, usually, show them some kind of advertising. Voilà: a business model! Over time, SEO techniques have spread and become insidious, such that googling anything can now feel like looking up “sneaker” in the dictionary and finding a definition that sounds both incorrect and suspiciously as though it were written by someone promoting Nike (“footwear that allows you to just do it!”). Perhaps this is why nearly everyone hates SEO and the people who do it for a living: the practice seems to have successfully destroyed the illusion that the internet was ever about anything other than selling stuff. So who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something. “This is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,” explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he’s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. “There’s definitely an ego among all of them,” he told me. “You succeed, and now you’re a genius. Now you’ve outdone Google.” This year, The Verge is exploring how Google Search has reshaped the web into a place for robots — and how the emergence of AI threatens Google itself. What happens when Google Search doesn’t have the answers? Who killed Google Reader? The end of the Googleverse The restaurant nearest Google The more I thought about search engine optimization and how a bunch of megalomaniacal jerks were degrading our collective sense of reality because they wanted to buy Lamborghinis and prove they could vanquish the almighty algorithm — which, technically, constitutes many algorithms, but we think of as a single force — the more I looked forward to going to Florida for this alligator party. Maybe, I thought, I would get to see someone who made millions clogging the internet with bullshit get the ultimate comeuppance. Maybe an SEO professional would get attacked by a gigantic, prehistoric-looking reptile right there in front of me. Maybe I could even repackage such a tragedy into a sensationalized anecdote for a viral article about the people who do SEO for a living, strongly implying that nature was here to punish the bad guy while somehow also assuming the ethical high ground and pretending I hadn’t been hoping this exact thing would happen from the start. Because I, too, use Google. I, too, want reliable and relevant things to come up when I look through this vast compendium of human knowledge. And I, too, enjoy the sweet taste of revenge. The first thing that went wrong at the alligator party was the alligator was only five and a half feet long, not 10 feet, as advertised. Classic clickbait! The second thing that went wrong at the alligator party was that I found almost everyone I met to be sympathetic, or at least nice enough not to want to see them get maimed by a five-and-a-half-foot alligator. My harshest assessment of the 200 digital marketers taking shots and swaying to a dancehall reggae band was that they dressed like they lived in Florida, which almost all of them did. Take Missy Ward, a blonde in an orange bandage dress so tight she told me she couldn’t take full steps. She laughed as she explained that she’d ordered the dress on Amazon and hadn’t tried it on until the day of the alligator party. Ward had a feisty, wry energy that made me want to root for her. When she started doing SEO in 1998, she said, it was “five girls and all dudes.” She eventually sold her company for $40 million. Somehow, in the moment, I was psyched to hear this. She was being so patient, explaining the history of SEO and suggesting other people for me to reach out to. I should really go talk with that guy across the room, who had a long-running podcast about SEO, she said, the one in the sky blue polo. His name was Daron Babin, and I quickly learned he was just the kind of “modern-day pirate shit” guy I’d been warned about: thrilled at the opportunity to recount the brilliant trickery that had allowed him to line his pockets. His SEO career got going in 1994, before Google even existed. “The air of manipulation was insane,” Babin told me. “We had this weird community of geeks and nerds, and we all talked to each other about how we were beating the algorithms up,” he said. “People were trying to outrank other people just for bragging rights.” We were chatting on a patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, between the buffet and the band, when the host of the alligator party, Darren Blatt, came up to say how glad he was that I’d found Daron Babin. “It was like I won the lottery, and I didn’t know how long it would last.” Darren and Daron (pronounced the same way) have been friends for decades, since the era when Darren “D-Money” Blatt would throw rap star-studded internet marketing shindigs during the Adult Video News Awards in Vegas, back when sex sites were among the most advanced in technology, and Daron Babin was using SEO to promote offshore casinos and Viagra (“We were outranking Pfizer!”). Together, Darren and Daron managed to milk all three of the early online cash cows: porn, pills, and gambling. As the internet became more regulated and mainstream, around the turn of the century, Darren noticed Daron’s SEO skills were increasingly in demand. “I told him that he was missing the boat, that he needed to be a consultant and charge a few grand,” Darren said. Daron took the advice, asking for $2,000 a day, and watched his career explode. “I would wake up in a city and not know what time zone I was in,” he recalled. To slow the pace, he upped it to $5,000 a day, but “it seemed the more I raised my rates, the more gigs I was getting.” Nowadays, he mostly invests in cannabis and psychedelics. SEO just got to be too complicated for not enough money, he told me. Ward had told me the same thing, that she had stopped focusing on SEO years ago. I was considering how it was possible that so many people have been complaining recently about SEO ruining the internet if these people were telling me the SEO business is in decline when I met Jairo Bastilla. He was the kind of tall, charming man who described himself multiple times as “a nerd,” and he pointed out that even though working directly with search engine rankings is “no longer monetizing at the highest payout,” the same “core knowledge of SEO” remains relevant for everything from native advertising to social media. Translation? SEO is now baked into everything. Bastilla, for example, specializes in email campaigns, which he called “deliverability.” As a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living. Why does it always seem to surprise me, even after all these years, that the way we behave on the internet is often quite different from how we act in real life? I wandered off to wait in line for a drink, where I noticed several people nonchalantly making space in a corner, as if to move out of the way for a bartender carrying empty glasses. There, squirming along the ground, was the alligator himself, wagging his tail, snout held shut by a thin strip of electrical tape. His handler was nowhere in sight. It was an unsettling vision, a predator pretending to be just another party guest. “They should untape the mouth!” someone shouted. “I’m not even scared.” As sunset turned to dusk, I found Daron Babin again, and he started telling me about one of his signature moves, back in the ’90s, involving fake domain names: “I could make it look like it was somebody else, but it actually redirected to me!” What he and his competitors did was legal but well beyond what the dominant search engine allowed. He never faced any consequences, but in the end, internet users at large felt the effects: “It muddied up Yahoo, ultimately,” he said, “but while it worked, we banked.” The situation sounded familiar. But I liked Babin. He was funny and smart, a keen observer of the SEO world. “We’re entering a very weird time, technologically, with AI, from an optimization standpoint,” he told me. Anyone who thought the internet was already saturated with SEO-oriented content should buckle up. “All the assholes that are out there paying shitty link-building companies to build shitty articles,” he said, “now they can go and use the free version of GPT.” Soon, he said, Google results would be even worse, dominated entirely by AI-generated crap designed to please the algorithms, produced and published at volumes far beyond anything humans could create, far beyond anything we’d ever seen before. “They’re not gonna be able to stop the onslaught of it,” he said. Then he laughed and laughed, thinking about how puny and irrelevant Google seemed in comparison to the next generation of automated SEO. “You can’t stop it!” Once I was safe at home, my alligator attack bluster having deflated into an irrepressible affection for clever scoundrels, mixed with fear about the future promised by said scoundrels, I decided to seek a broader range of the people who do SEO for a living. Perhaps the ones who live in Florida were simply too, well, Florida, and the ones who live elsewhere might be more principled? An old contact heard I was writing about SEO and suggested I find a man he called Legendary Lars: “He was an absolute god in that space.” I tracked down Lars Mapstead in Northern California, where he was preparing to run for president in 2024 as a Libertarian. Mapstead spent the first two years of his life in a Volkswagen van traveling the Pacific coast before his hippie parents settled on a Big Sur property with goats, chickens, and no electricity. He became a tinkerer and an autodidact, the guy who reads the instruction manual and fixes everything himself. When he first heard about the World Wide Web, it was 1993, and he was working for a company selling computer motherboards. “It’s like the freedom of information!” he remembered thinking. “It’s all just about collaborating and bettering mankind!” He learned how to build a website and then how to submit a site to be listed in early search directories like AltaVista, WebCrawler, Infoseek, and Lycos. He learned how to create chat rooms, attracting people spread across the globe, all alone in their homes but together online. It was beautiful. It was exciting. Mapstead saw himself as an explorer in a small but finite kingdom. “I had surfed the entire internet. There wasn’t a page I hadn’t seen.” And then, one day, a company in New York offered to pay him $2,000 a month to put banner ads on one of his websites, and everything changed. More clicks meant more ad dollars. Higher search engine rankings meant more clicks. So whatever it took to get a higher ranking, he learned how to do. He bought photographs of women in bikinis and made a 60-page slideshow with banner ads on each page. He realized that most search engines were just listing websites in order of how many times a search term appeared on the site and in its tags, so he focused on stuffing his sites with keywords, resubmitting his URL to the search engines, and waiting for the results to change. Mapstead started pulling in $25,000–$30,000 a month, working 12- to 14-hour days. “It was how long could I stay awake and how little life could I have because this was more money than I could have ever imagined in my lifetime,” he told me. “It was like I won the lottery, and I didn’t know how long it would last.” Around this time, in 1997, an Italian professor published a journal article about what he called Search Engines Persuasion. “Finding the right information on the World Wide Web is becoming a fundamental problem,” he wrote. “A vast number of new companies was born just to make customer Web pages as visible as possible,” which “has led to a bad performance degradation of search engines.” Enter Google. The company revolutionized search by evaluating websites based on links from other websites, seeing each link as a vote of relevance and trustworthiness. The founders pledged to be a neutral navigation system with no ads: just a clean white screen with a search box that would bring people off of the Google landing page and out to a helpful website as seamlessly as possible. Users quickly decided this link-based sorting methodology was superior to the existing search engines, and by the end of 1999, Google was handling the majority of online queries. “I was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month.” Mapstead, like many of the early practitioners of SEO, figured out how to adapt. Almost as soon as Google took over, a secondary market emerged for links. For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links from blog networks built entirely for that purpose. It was easy: buy links that led to your site and watch your ranking in Google’s results rise. I came to understand that, since the dawn of the internet, there have been people attempting to manipulate search and then people decrying those manipulations as the end of search’s ability to be useful. It works in cycles. People doing SEO find loopholes in the algorithm; critics complain about search results; search engines innovate and close the loopholes. Rinse, repeat. Before our current moment of widespread disillusionment with online information, the rise of SEO had reached a breaking point multiple times. In 2003, as Google approached the deadline to disclose pertinent business information leading up to its IPO, the company quietly released an update cracking down. By 2011, SEO was once again oppressively pervasive. TechCrunch published a story called “Why We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google,” which argued that “Google has become a jungle: a tropical paradise for spammers and marketers.” In the next year, Google made two major changes to the algorithm, which came to be called Panda and Penguin. While the public might have experienced each of these updates as a relief, Mapstead and his SEO compatriots saw them as devastating. “They change the rules instantly overnight, and then you’re out of business,” he told me. “Here you’re trying to rely on this business model to feed yourself and your family, and they’re pulling the rug from underneath you, and you’ve gotta scramble to pay rent.” But don’t worry about Mapstead. This is a guy seemingly blessed with a never-ending mental stream of schemes. He helped start a handful of companies, including the once-ubiquitous hookup site AdultFriendFinder, which sold in 2007 for $500 million. He tried to retire after that but got bored and started a couple of Facebook pages devoted to his passion for hot rods and custom cars. This was during the peak years for social media, and just as Bastilla had described back at the alligator party, Mapstead’s “core knowledge of SEO” came in handy. Before long, his pages had 25 million followers. “I was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month,” he told me. “And that was supposed to be my hobby!” As I spoke with more SEO professionals around the country, I began to think that the reason I found them endearing and not evil was that while many had made quite a bit of money, almost none had amassed significant power. Unlike the Elon Musks and Jeff Bezoses of the world, who went from geeky teenagers to masters of the universe, the dorks who grew up to do SEO have stayed the butt of the joke, beholden to the fluctuations of the algorithm, frantically pulling levers behind the scenes but ultimately somewhat hapless. I mean, have I even mentioned that they call themselves “SEOs”? Really. They say things like, “As the SEO, my job is to get more traffic.” This title feels thirsty to be seen as similar to a CEO, to be taken seriously. And compared to the rest of the tech world, SEO has always lacked a certain glamor or a certain messiah complex. Case in point: while many of the tech CEOs claiming to save the world these days live in Miami, the alligator party was an hour up the coast in Fort Lauderdale. “The SEO people are just trying to make money,” said Peter Kent, the author of several dozen explanatory tech books, including SEO for Dummies and Bitcoin for Dummies. “The cryptocurrency people are trying to make money, but they’re also trying to overthrow, you know, the existing system.” Kent has done his fair share of SEO jobs but also has something of an outsider’s perspective. For years, he’s been telling people that part of the SEO industry’s reputation problem is that 80 percent of SEOs are scammers. “A lot of companies and individuals out there selling their services as SEO gurus don’t know what they’re doing or don’t really give a damn,” he explained. As a consultant, he’s often had businesses ask him to vet the work of other SEOs. “I would take a look at their site and determine the firm had done next to nothing and had been charging thousands a month for years on end.” When I ran this 80 percent scam figure by other SEOs, most agreed it sounded accurate, though people were divided about what to ascribe to greed and what was just stupidity. “It isn’t because they have a scammer’s heart,” said Bruce Clay. “It’s because they don’t have the real expertise.” Clay is an avuncular man with a mustache who is often credited with coining the phrase “search engine optimization” and is therefore called “the father of SEO.” He told me his agency never hires an SEO with less than a decade of experience. “I don’t know if you can trust anything you read online.” Though Google publishes guidelines explaining how to do better in search (“Make your site interesting and useful”), the exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret, meaning that SEO involves a lot of reverse engineering and guesswork. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site’s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on the mien of a premodern farmer, struggling to figure out how to make it rain. Should he do that dance he did last year the night before it poured? Or maybe sacrifice his firstborn? The algorithm is just too opaque, too complicated, and too dynamic, making it easy for scammy SEOs to pretend they know what they’re doing and difficult for outsiders to sort the good SEOs from the bad. To make things even more confusing for, say, a small business looking to hire someone to improve their Google ranking, even a talented SEO might need a year of work to make a difference, perhaps implying a good SEO was a scammer when in fact, the client was just being impatient or refusing to implement essential advice. “There’s a great deal of effort that’s required to do things to move the needle, and a lot of companies aren’t willing to put out the money for that, even though it may be worthwhile in the long run,” said John Heard, a longtime SEO based in Kansas. Of course, some people bristled at the very suggestion that the industry is filled with con artists. “There are a lot of scammers in every single business. It’s just easier to call yourself an SEO than a doctor,” said Barry Schwartz. Schwartz is an unbelievably fast talker and a prolific writer who has spent the past two decades covering SEO for the trade rag Search Engine Land. Both over the phone with me and in his work, he has defended SEO as a legitimate, dignified pursuit: “The search community is filled with hard-working individuals working to help their clients’ websites succeed in Google Search. That success is not done through dark, corrupt or shady tactics but rather hard, smart and thorough work.” Several people that I spoke to made a similar point: the best SEOs are the ones that follow Google’s rules, which essentially ask you to make amazing websites without even thinking about Google. You are not supposed to make any attempt to artificially boost a website’s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. And many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots and people who get ahead by violating Google’s terms of service, just as the mild-mannered teacher’s pet in a classroom does not negate the obnoxious shouting of the kids that refuse to behave. A few loud kids can easily drown everyone else out. Even Schwartz acknowledged the effect that the rule-breaking SEOs have had on the internet experience. We get to talking about the types of small businesses that are particularly lucrative customers for SEOs, including lawyers, accountants, and contractors, because these are the professions eager for attention from all the people going online to find local recommendations. If Schwartz himself had to hire a reliable attorney, I asked, what would be the best way to do so? “I don’t know if you can trust anything you read online,” he told me. “Maybe you ask a friend.” After hearing so much about what it was like to be an SEO, I decided it was time to better understand what’s been going on from the perspective of the search engine. Google was slow to allow someone to talk with me, possibly because of the giant PR clusterfuck that has been the company’s past year (accused by the federal government of being a monopoly; increasingly despised by the public; losing ground to Reddit, TikTok, and large language models), so I decided to start by meeting up with a chipper, charismatic man named Duane Forrester. Forrester was at Microsoft from 2007 until 2015, where he helped launch and manage Bing, the perpetual underdog to Google’s domination of online search. Before and after his time at Microsoft, Forrester worked as an SEO, so he sees the industry from both sides, like an aerospace engineer who spent a few years at the Department of Defense, left for the private sector, and now is much better at winning military contracts. Forrester has a holistic understanding of the delicate push and pull between the SEOs desperate for clues on how to do their jobs better and the search engine trying to keep its secret-sauce algorithm proprietary. He also knows a huge range of people in the industry. Like Schwartz, he wanted to emphasize how hard everyone works. “I’ve lost track of how many people I know who built companies and sold them and have just, like, made wealth,” he told me. “That is not a 40-hour commitment in the week. That is a 400-hour commitment.” (For the record, there are 168 hours in a week.) These days, Forrester lives in Los Angeles, and he asked me to meet him at one of his favorite restaurants, which felt like a British pub operated by Disney World, tucked away in a desert strip mall. Inside, every inch was covered in Anglophile paraphernalia, including Union Jack flags, a mural of Big Ben, and a red phone booth. Over a full English breakfast, he told me about growing up in rural Canada, where his parents owned a motel. As a kid, he used to mess around with the pay phone outside, eventually figuring out how to finagle free long-distance phone calls. “And then it became, ‘What else can I know how to do?’” By the ’90s, Forrester was trading tips with other SEOs in online forums. He still remembers the thrill of the very first SEO conference he went to, where he was asked to speak. “The people who got up onstage to talk were seen as somehow more knowledgeable, but I don’t know that we felt that way,” he said. “You all kind of knew you were making shit up.” After years of being friends online, the SEOs were eager to let loose in person, giving off what Forrester described as “that vibe of a lot of young people with access to a lot of money. And it was like, no expenses spared in New York City.” “What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done?” For Forrester, it was the start of a long career of keynote presentations and consummate schmoozing — Clay, the father of SEO, described him to me as “a cruise director” on the SS SEO. The conference circuit has treated Forrester well. He’s attended events in Napa, Hawaii, and Barbados, among many others, as well as “an infinite number of private dinners and these types of things in every city you can think of, at the most lavish restaurants,” he said. “I’ve lost track of how many Michelin-starred meals I’ve had, ’cause it’s now in the dozens, from my time in this industry. And I’m not going to say no to the dinner that everyone’s going to, that one company is sponsoring because it’s a thank you to everybody who contributed to, whatever it was, you know? And you go and everybody has a good time. You talk about the industry, and that’s it. And it becomes the stuff of legends.” Over the years, he’s seen it all. He remembered “walking into hotel rooms and it’s two o’clock in the morning, there’s drugs and alcohol and everything everywhere, and there’s a party going on.” Forrester marveled at the audacity of his fellow SEOs. “Somebody showed up and brought her Aston Martin to a conference and parked it at the front door. Immediately got a parking ticket.” He suggested she might want to relocate the car before it got towed, but the woman told him she would just move it to the next parking spot and get another ticket. “She goes, ‘It’s cheaper for me to leave the car parked out front and use it as a way to start conversations with potential clients than it is for me to rent a suite at the hotel and get people to go to the suite to have the same conversation.’” Then, she offered to take Forrester for a joyride around Seattle. Obviously, he said yes. Once he represented Bing, Forrester more or less stopped drinking at conferences, as had long been the case for his counterpart at Google, an engineer named Matt Cutts, who helped build and then ran the company’s web spam team before stepping back in 2014 and leaving in 2016. Cutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. When we spoke on the phone, he told me that before he left, he determined that he had sent about 50,000 emails to people outside of Google during his decade and a half at the company. Several SEOs described trying to get Cutts to drink at conferences so he would “spill secrets,” as one put it, but what generally ended up happening was that all the SEOs would get drunk instead. Meanwhile, Cutts would stay sober, jotting down the latest SEO methods on a small notepad, sitting quietly in the corner at the bar. “My favorite question to ask an SEO,” Cutts told me, was, “What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done?” which prompted responses that felt like “a cross between showing off and a confessional.” So many SEOs were tempted to reveal the vulnerabilities they’d discovered in Google’s algorithms, even when they were talking to the one person they really shouldn’t have been talking to, the guy who was planning to go back to his office and make those vulnerabilities disappear. As a former SEO himself, Forrester understood that the quality of Bing’s search results would be impacted by the work of SEOs, so it made sense to communicate with SEOs as much as possible. Cutts similarly tried to serve as a conduit between SEOs and Google, but Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude he described as: “We know what we’re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this, and you know what? We’ll just kind of ignore you, and when you give us feedback, eh, we don’t really care.” Cutts, as an individual, seemed to be doing his best within an expanding corporate behemoth to remain approachable. “One thing I learned early on was that even when someone was shouting at you, there’s a kernel of something you needed to hear in the other person and listen to and respect and integrate and incorporate,” he told me. Most SEOs told me they appreciated his efforts. When Google released the 2011 Panda update that devastated a generation of SEO businesses, Cutts openly recognized the impossible task of achieving the kind of epistemological neutrality that Google’s founders had initially promised, telling Wired at the time, “[T]he only way to be neutral is either to randomize the links or to do it alphabetically.” Still, some blamed him personally for “killing” companies that had relied on the previous iteration of the algorithm. During his time at Google, Cutts regularly received death threats and hate mail. When SEOs would send, say, a fruit plate or a brownie cake addressed to him at Google’s offices, he told me, “We’d take it down to the kitchen with a note warning: possibly poisoned.” After Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people, none of whom could quite fill his shoes: “Those personalities sometimes were standoffish,” Forrester told me. “Some of them were superior. Some of them were a bit too wallflower.” One of the people Google brought in was Danny Sullivan, a former journalist who started Search Engine Land, the industry publication where Schwartz works, back in the 2000s. In 2009, Sullivan was described as “the closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,” so when he published “A deep look at Google’s biggest-ever search quality crisis” in 2017 and then took a job as Google’s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist. “There is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn’t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,” Forrester told me. “I don’t believe that’s the case,” he went on, but compared to Cutts, “I think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.” Was all that really Google’s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. When I finally manage to jump through the flaming rings necessary to be allowed to speak on the phone with Sullivan, albeit with a communications chaperone also on the line, I find him angry and defensive. He’s annoyed that anyone would think his era at Google has been less transparent than Cutts’ was: “We have reams of help documents!” he told me. “We have more people assigned to work with SEOs than we did when Matt worked here!” Sullivan is mad that the public and the media don’t really understand what he considers to be basic precepts about how search works, leading him to adopt a rather scolding tone online. He’s frustrated that people want to know every last detail about Google’s algorithm because even “if we listed all one thousand of the ranking signals” and how much each was worth, he said, that wouldn’t actually help SEOs do their jobs better, anyway. And most of all, Sullivan is pissed that people think Google results have gone downhill. Because they haven’t, he insisted. If anything, search results have gotten a lot better over time. Anyone who thought search quality was worse needed to take a hard look in the mirror. “We have an entire generation that grew up expecting the search box to do the work for them,” he said. “We might do a better job of matching for a bulk of people, but for people who are super sensitive, when they have that fail moment, now it becomes, ‘All my searches aren’t good.’” The problem was not Google. The problem was not SEOs. The problem was kids these days. Of course Sullivan would say this, though. He works for Google. I felt like I began to understand why many SEOs had told me that Cutts’ departure had marked a major turning point in the history of the internet, emblematic of Google’s transition from idealistic startup to one of the most valuable and powerful companies to ever exist. Over the phone, Cutts came off as humble and thoughtful, acknowledging the nuances and challenges of the search engine business, while Sullivan sounded like an impatient corporate stooge, trying to gaslight me into believing the sky was red. But here’s the part where I started to feel the way I’ve felt so often in recent years, like I was losing my grip on reality: Sullivan was not the only person who tried to tell me that search results have improved significantly. Out of the dozen-plus SEOs that I spoke with at length, nearly every single one insisted that search results are way better than they used to be. And except for Sullivan, these were not people with an incentive to praise Google. If anything, these were folks who lamented how much harder it had become for them to take advantage of Google. Today, they told me, search results are just objectively more accurate. More useful. More difficult to manipulate. This was not what I had been noticing, and this was certainly not what I had been hearing from friends and journalists and friends who are journalists. Were all of us wrong? Or engulfed in some kind of Baader–Meinhof frequency bias delusion? Had I been researching a nonexistent problem? Were Google results actually amazing? Truly, I had lost the plot. Was the premise of this piece completely off? Was I the asshole who deserved to be attacked by an alligator? I began to worry all the people who were mad about search results were upset about something that had nothing to do with metrics and everything to do with feelings and ~vibes~ and a universal, non-Google-specific resentment and rage about how the internet has made our lives so much worse in so many ways, dividing us and deceiving us and provoking us and making us sadder and lonelier. Decades of American optimism about the wonderful potential of technology, from the Moon landing to personal computers to the iPhone, had finally, in the last few years, broken down into comprehensive chagrin at the petty, pathetic, and violent world enabled by our devices. Was all that really Google’s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. To muddy it up, as Babin had put it, but while it worked, to make as much fucking money as possible. The person who helped me snap out of my confusion spiral was an SEO named Lily Ray. Ray is a 30-something jet-setter with black-line tattoos and an asymmetrical, dyed blonde pixie cut. I managed to catch her for lunch in Brooklyn between speaking gigs in Chicago and Berlin on a day when she was also simultaneously managing a 35-person team at her digital marketing agency, posting multiple times an hour on social media, dog-sitting for a Pomeranian whose “daddies” were at Burning Man, caring for her own mini Australian shepherd, and organizing the house party she was hosting that weekend — a party she expected to be late for because she first had to drop by a rooftop to perform a DJ set at a different party. Ray reassured me that I was not crazy. Google results today do feel different from how they felt just five or six years ago for two major reasons. The first was Google’s response to the disinformation panic around the 2016 election, which involved questioning the notion that the most reliable information could be chosen by a form of popularity, meaning how many links a site received from other sites. As a result, the algorithm seemed to change its approach to links, especially when it came to news and sites offering legal, financial, or health advice, and instead paid more attention to what Google came to call E-E-A-T: experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. “E-E-A-T has had a pretty big impact on what types of results you see,” Ray told me. She’s done extensive (and fascinating) research around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what’s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately affecting right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has described heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start. Now, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority. You can’t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at This felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw. The second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO — specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO. “SEO that goes against Google’s guidelines, it’s not new,” Ray explained. A decade ago, it used to be called “black hat” SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved “white hat” tactics. And Google has, as Sullivan and many SEOs told me, gotten better over time at catching SEOs playing tricks on the algorithm. Although many of us may have rosy memories of how magical and cool Google seemed in the early days, most SEOs consider the years between 2003 and 2011 to be the boom times, when you could still get a fake corporate website listed above the real corporate website, and you could mess with the search results for a major political figure such that something sexual or racist would come up first. Google is harder to game now — it’s true. But the sheer volume of SEO bait being produced is so massive and so complex that Google is overwhelmed. “It’s exponentially worse,” Ray said. “People can mass auto-generate content with AI and other tools,” she went on, and “in many cases, Google’s algorithms take a minute to catch onto it.” The future that Babin had cackled about at the alligator party was already here. We humans and our pedestrian questions were getting caught up in a war of robots fighting robots, of Google’s algorithms trying to find and stop the AI-enabled sites programmed by SEOs from infecting our internet experience. Eventually, a site filled with computer-generated nonsense designed to maximize SEO will get removed from search results, Ray explained, but while it’s up, the creator might make as much as $50,000 or $100,000 a month. A lot of the people who did this, she said, live cheaply overseas in places like Bali and Chiang Mai. ”They make a bunch of money, that site dies, and they go do it again,” she said. “It’s like a churn and burn strategy. So if people are seeing those results, it can be very frustrating for users ‘cause it’s like, ‘This is terrible.’” And yet, as much as she despises what this kind of SEO has done to the internet, Ray told me she hesitated to condemn the actual people doing it. “I used to do those types of tactics, so I couldn’t hate on anybody personally,” she said. “If people have a problem with Google’s results, they have to ask themselves, is it the fault of the SEOs?” she asked. “Or is this Google behaving differently than it used to?” Sullivan had tried to convince me that Google was not behaving differently and, in fact, had not changed its search criteria in any major way for the past 20 years. Google wanted you to make good websites, and that was that. Everyone who tried to rank higher by messing with the algorithm would be blocked. Sullivan even insisted that what these rule-breakers did should not be called SEO: he deemed it all “spam.” What is spam? “Spam is stuff that search engines don’t like.” But the line between strategies that violate Google’s terms of service and strategies that don’t has always been blurry and inconsistently enforced. “I’ve never seen this much tension in the industry in terms of, like, what Google says to do and what people are doing and getting away with,” Ray told me. “If you’re gonna tell us that this stuff doesn’t work, make it stop working!” Ray seemed like the most reasonable person I had spoken to so far. Sure, she called herself a “thought leader,” and yes, sure, she had changed her last name to improve her personal branding by more closely associating herself with her grandmother’s uncle, the artist Man Ray. Maybe some people would say that’s the kind of absurd behavior that merits being attacked by an alligator, but I was beginning to come down on the side of the SEOs, who seemed to have a lot less agency than I’d first imagined. Google had started with a noble cause: trying to make the internet easier to navigate at scale. The company did accomplish that goal, but in doing so, it inadvertently and profoundly changed how the internet looked. The problem lay in Google trying to be an objective and neutral arbiter of an information landscape that was meant to pretend it did not exist. You cannot design a free, automated system to help people find information without some people trying to game that system. You can’t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at. For the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google’s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google’s choices and priorities. As Google’s founders wrote back in 1997: “we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.” At the end of the day, it’s Google’s world, and the SEOs are only living in it There’s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business’s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library. Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge. Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity. “There were so many true believers at Google in the early days,” Cutts told me. “As companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.” He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, “I deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.” He speculated that the company didn’t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness “encourages regulators and makes people realize, ‘Oh, there’s a lot of money here.’” There has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can’t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it’s Google’s world, and the SEOs are only living in it. And as much as I might hate the way the SEOs who don’t follow Google’s rules have altered my online experience, the reality is that most people running a company will break whatever rules they are able to get away with breaking. While Ray herself said she has left behind the guideline-violating tactics of her past, choosing instead to do as Google asks and make high-quality websites that will “make the internet a better place,” as she put it, that kind of moral standard can be a lot to ask of someone running a business. “They want this wholesome thing, and I can understand that. That’d be neat,” said an SEO named Cade Lee. “But that’s maybe in a world where we don’t have money and greed and things, you know?” Lee was the person I spoke with on the phone before going to the alligator party, the guy who warned me that SEO was “modern-day pirate shit.” He is among the SEOs who have spoken publicly, on panels, about violating Google’s guidelines. He’s also an ex-con who used to trade penny stocks and served time for securities fraud. His entire body is covered in tattoos, from his scalp to his legs to his fingers. When we met up for beers in Denver at a bar outside an escape room, he told me that his probation officer in the economic crime offenders unit has never tried to stop him from violating Google’s terms of service. “I was transparent about it, and they approved it,” he said. They even approved “some pretty questionable things, like in regards to adult sites,” he told me, specifically involving what he’d thought were ads for consensual sex workers. Later, an activist reached out and showed him how certain websites he had built were supporting human trafficking. Horrified, he shut the whole thing down, even then helping the activist with her website. These days, Lee runs a construction company. His probation officer hates when he phrases it like this, but he thinks any way you make money is essentially a con or a scam of some kind. “The good con is like, you actually delivered, and you came through and made a profit.” For example: “We’re gonna take that old lady’s money to build her a brand new patio. There’s that scam, and then there’s, ‘Hey, let’s take her deposit and run.’” Lee is the kind of guy who has spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world: what matters, what doesn’t, and how his actions affect other people. He was in the Marines, he sold mortgages in the lead-up to the 2008 crash, he went to prison, he’s done SEO. He understands that he needs to make money to survive, but he’d like to do so in a way that is minimally harmful. So he prefers the good kind of con. “That’s what happened with SEO for me — it was becoming bullshit,” he says. “I was not feeling good about customer meetings and about what I was saying, and I was like, ‘I shouldn’t be doing this.’” Correction: An earlier version of the piece misstated when Search Engine Land was founded. It was in the 2000s, not the ‘90s. We regret the error. 96 COMMENTS96 NEW Most Popular The EV transition trips over its own cord Joe Rogan’s big decision Here’s a rare look at Google’s most lucrative search queries The people who ruined the internet DoorDash now warns you that your food might get cold if you don’t tip Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

(theverge.com) 289 points by DASD 16 hours ago| hidepastfavorite265 comments fsckboy 11 hours agoI&#x27;m old, very educated, very experienced, technical, etc. My assistant is young and none of the above. She finds everything very quickly through internet searches. However-it-is that google is interpreting search terms, that&#x27;s how her brain works. I told her about a house I drove by that looked like a cool Halloween house. While I was still telling her basics about it, she was already pulling up pictures of it. I had said the house looked like it was melting, so she typed in \"melting house\", I think. Not that that&#x27;s genius or quirky or anything, but I would never dream of typing in something I was thinking \"informally\", and her approach is more like \"whatever whackadoo thing I&#x27;m thinking, probably other people think just like me\" and she finds anything I ask her about. (I&#x27;ve pretested that query, and turns out that there are melting houses all over the world, just gotta look in your neighborhood)so to the point here, I lament that Google doesn&#x27;t work any more, but she doesn&#x27;t, she thinks it works great. Now if I can just get her to stop finding restaurant recommendations on TikTok... reply pclmulqdq 10 hours agoparentThe trick is that Google actually works great. It works better than before. It just doesn&#x27;t work in the way that we (highly educated and technical people) want. We all laughed at our parents and grandparents for typing full sentence questions into the search bar in 2005 instead of carefully crafted incantations with keywords, \"site:\" labels and other such things. Young people often use full sentences today because that is what works.The google we grew up with was a tool that allowed you to precisely retrieve authoritative writings related to a subject, but today&#x27;s google is a lot more like ChatGPT than that. reply underwater 7 hours agorootparentNo, Google results are trash. Here are three examples from this week:- I Googled \"speed work running\", wanting some workout suggestions. I visited four or five results that either didn&#x27;t have concrete suggestions, were poorly written, or overly verbose. I ended my search with little faith that I was getting good advice. I typed the same thing into ChatGPT and got a suggestion of 6 different workouts that all seemed coherent.- I asked Google Home \"How do I make overnight oats\". It replied, \"I found a result for [...], should I read it?\" then \"The first ingredient is Nutella\". That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s all it said. I tried the same search on the web, and every result Google result was spam that was 20 paragraphs of inane blog content with a recipe tacked on the end. Again, ChatGPT then gave me a sane, baseline, recipe.- I searched Google for \"how much caffeine is in coffee\". It gave me a calculator that said, \"40 mg\" and then a suggestion an alternative search for \"Q: How much caffeine is in an average cup of coffee? A: between 80 to 100 milligrams\". It turns out the calculator was normalizing the caffeine content to caffeine per 100mg of coffee.I&#x27;m using Google exactly how their product is training me to use it, but the failure modes are all consistent. Google&#x27;s AI features has not real understanding of the world, so their instant answers are frequently nonsensical. And Google clearly can&#x27;t filter out SEO garbage.Even if they could filter out SEO garbage, Google&#x27;s early success killed the golden goose. 99% of web publishers are publishing content for Google, not for their readers and web publishing has become a cynically commercial affair. Individual publishers have by and large moved on from the web to other creator-focused platforms. So, the quality and experience of web content is absolute rubbish. Results are filled with cookie banners, ads, signup prompts, verbose SEO filler, poor writing, lack of authority, etc. reply reactordev 6 hours agorootparentYou are using it right however your bias is evident on the results. A 20-something will just scroll through the blog content to get to the recipe at the end. No huss, no fuss. In fact, they’ll open multiple tabs of search results to compare recipes in the time it takes you to gawk at the fact that you have to scroll to the end. Where is the recipe? Why is there a video? Table of contents? No, a 20-something will just flick their screen wildly until they are at the bottom, and scroll up. Give me the results and backtrack to where I’m at. This I think is a result of their upbringing and everyone’s focus on results rather than process. So you may believe you are doing everything correct but you are just going through the motions. The web today is different than it was even 5 years ago.I wish I could search like I used to but we are where we are. reply jessriedel 5 hours agorootparentThe fact that young people have gotten used to inefficiencies and have gotten good at partially working around them does not mean the inefficiencies aren&#x27;t there.This often works the opposite generational direction: when a young person has a flat tire they often call a road service and wait two hours, while the old guy would install the spare himself in less than 8 minutes. But either way, flat tires are inefficiencies that are best eliminated. reply Semaphor 6 hours agorootparentprev> A 20-something will just scroll through the blog content to get to the recipe at the end. No huss, no fuss. In fact, they’ll open multiple tabs of search results to compare recipes in the time it takes you to gawk at the fact that you have to scroll to the end.Uh, I do that and I’m 37. But I don’t scroll, I click the button that says \"recipe\" that’s on pretty much every recipe site.IMO this is mainly about being used to the state of recipe sites on the internet, and has nothing to do with searching. reply underwater 5 hours agorootparentThe state of recipe sites is 100% driven by Google. Those sites add the fluff because that is what Google rewards. The actual recipe quality doesn&#x27;t matter. If I use my example, the page contains:* Bio of the author - Google SEO rewards content written by \"real humans\", so this is there to appease the bot.* Giant images of overnight oats - This helps the page rank highly on Google Image Search.* Fluffy paragraphs - \"The beauty of overnight oats is that you can make them as simple or creative as you’d like. The base recipe is delicious, and filling all on its own. But if you’d like to spruce it up, you can add a variety of toppings and mix-ins, including fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, spices, jams, and more\". Is that supposed to be text written for other humans? Google rewards original content, which means recipe sites need to include massive paragraphs of filler to appear like an authoritative source.* Ads - Gotta make the money.* More fluff \"Here’s a few reasons why you should to whip up this recipe today…\" - Again, this is not text written for humans.* Repeat the fluff, pictures and ads approximately 5 times.* Common questions \"Do you have to use yogurt?\" - Trying to appeal to Google Instant Answer searches.* Recipe - Finally!* Recipe rating - This allows the site to put a star rating and review count on Google, again, for SEOSo, 95% of the content and functionality of that page is an attempt to convince Google into sending traffic, or ads generating revenue, rather than serving the end user.Content on the web has dramatically changed from 20 years ago because publishers are creating content for a broken machine and not for other humans. This negative feedback loop is hurting the web, and not just Google. This leaves the door open for upstarts like ChatGPT or TikTok to gain mindshare. reply pests 3 hours agorootparentThis is more on copyright law than Google.> Recipes can be protected under copyright law if they are accompanied by “substantial literary expression.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copyrightalliance.org&#x2F;are-recipes-cookbooks-protecte...So the fluff is both an attempt at that substantial literary expression, and a way to differentiate this version of the recipe from 1000 other versions of the _exact_ recipe because the recipe itself is not unqiue or copyrightable! Without it, recipe&#x27;s would be penalized by the duplicate content penalty Google applies. reply nulbyte 45 minutes agorootparentI think this is more about ads then copyright. All these recipe blogs I&#x27;ve seen still follow with an uncopyrightable list of ingredients and simple directions. The recipe still isn&#x27;t worthy of copyright, even if the content accompanying it is. Sure, the author may be working on something they are passionate about, but the site itself is all about the ad revenue. reply reactordev 5 hours agorootparentprev100% agree that all the fluff is for the machines and not humans. The web has been broken this way since 2014. The feedback loop is real. reply Semaphor 3 hours agorootparentprevSorry, I might not have been precise enough, I did not mean to say that this is not because of Google, only that knowing how to use recipe sites is very distinct from knowing how to google, you even encounter those sites no matter what SE you use (I haven’t used Google in years). reply smsm42 3 hours agorootparentprevLooks like what you&#x27;re saying is that the results are garbage but people who don&#x27;t know it could be better are fine with it, because they learned it&#x27;s how the world works and can&#x27;t be otherwise. While the ones who are cursed with the knowledge that it can be are left to complain. reply candiodari 2 hours agorootparentI learned a trick recently. If you want \"copyright-challenged\" results, or exact results, try Yandex. It&#x27;s a worse search engine and, therefore, better at matching exact text. reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparentprev>A 20-something will just scroll through the blog content to get to the recipe at the end.

Perhaps different keywords would work better?For example, “speed work running”, were you looking to improve sprinting? (I’m not a runner, so it almost reads to me like “working fast while on a treadmill”). Reading the rest of your example, maybe “sprint workouts” would give better results?(40+yr old guy here, Google had always worked for me, as many people had described it working for 20yr olds. Finding the right, specific enough set of keywords had always been my “trick”. Little did I realize I subconsciously generate embeddings like a LLM to Google search) reply underwater 5 hours agorootparent\"Speed work\" is a class of running drills. The term is very common in running. I&#x27;ll let ChatGPT explain. This was its response was given the same prompt, when I specifically asked it to give me options it&#x27;s answer was more specific:Speed work in running is a type of training that focuses on improving your running speed and anaerobic fitness. It involves various structured workouts and drills designed to increase your stride turnover and overall pace. Speed work is essential for athletes who want to enhance their performance in races or simply become faster runners.Common forms of speed work in running include:Interval Training: Interval workouts involve alternating between periods of high-intensity running (fast) and rest or recovery jogging. For example, you might run fast for 1 minute and then jog or walk for 1-2 minutes to recover. This process is repeated multiple times.Fartlek Training: Fartlek, which means \"speed play\" in Swedish, is an unstructured form of speed work. During a fartlek run, you mix bursts of faster running with slower paces or jogging. You can do this based on how you feel or choose landmarks as your guide.Hill Repeats: Running uphill at a high intensity is an excellent way to build strength and speed. Hill repeat workouts involve running up a hill at a fast pace and then jogging or walking back down to recover. This is repeated for a set number of repetitions.Tempo Runs: Tempo runs are sustained efforts at a \"comfortably hard\" pace, typically just below your anaerobic threshold. This helps improve your lactate threshold and race pace.Track Workouts: These are structured speed sessions done on a running track. Common track workouts include 400-meter repeats, 800-meter repeats, and 1,600-meter repeats, where you run at a fast, consistent pace and take rest intervals between each repetition.Strides: Strides are short, fast runs of about 100 meters that help improve running form and leg turnover. They are typically done at the end of an easy run.It&#x27;s essential to incorporate speed work into your training regimen gradually to avoid overuse injuries and adapt to the increased intensity. Make sure to warm up properly and cool down after each speed workout. Consult with a coach or experienced runner to create a personalized training plan that suits your goals and fitness level. Additionally, listen to your body and allow for sufficient recovery between speed sessions to prevent overtraining. reply pclmulqdq 5 hours agorootparentIf you search \"speed work running drills\" on Google, you get relevant results. It kind of sounds like you are cherry picking the \"bad prompts\" you sent to Google and comparing them to good prompts sent to GPT-4. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentThey specifically said that they used the same prompt. If I feed the exact string \"speed work running\" into ChatGPT 3.5 I get back essentially the same results that OP includes. reply throwaway447 34 minutes agorootparentprev- I searched Google for \"how much caffeine is in coffee\". It gave me a calculator that said, \"40 mg\" ... It turns out the calculator was normalizing the caffeine content to caffeine per 100mg of coffee.\"Man, you have strong coffee. :-( reply atorodius 4 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, my human brain did not understand your first query, in the second you conflate voice search with Google, and re the last, if I try it, it shows me a dropdown to select what I meant…(Generally just confused by how ppl always claim it’s trash or it got worse but there never is a solid benchmark) reply onion2k 3 hours agorootparentprevif they could filter out SEO garbageI think the problem with Google is that &#x27;garbage&#x27; is highly subjective, and what you think is awful is actually highly engaging for a lot of users. Google has massive amounts of data about what results users click on, how much time they spend on a website, how much scrolling they do, etc. To technical people we see that as SEO &#x27;trapping&#x27; people to push engagement rankings up, but the reality is that it&#x27;s just engagement. People could leave a site of they wanted to, but they don&#x27;t. They scroll through those 20 paragraphs of recipe back story. That data means Google are finding accurate results.If anything this shows that Google&#x27;s results personalization isn&#x27;t taking your engagement into account. A problem that will get worse as more people block analytics. reply danmaz74 2 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with \"SEO garbage\" is that SEO is highly adaptive - whatever change Google does, SEO will almost immediately find a way to adapt and stay relevant. There is just too much money to be made for those involved. reply candiodari 2 hours agorootparentNo the problem is that Google did what they really, really promised never to do: to optimize for financial gain, keep people on the Google site, clicking on ads instead of telling them what they want to know. Like one of those 10-episode Netflix documentaries. reply themoonisachees 23 minutes agorootparentPrecisely. The main problem with google is that it&#x27;s extremely hard to align yourself with the goals of humans with human needs, so they have to look at proxy metrics to rank sites before anyone actually hits them. Their current proxy metric appears to be that there is a lot of human-sounding text on the page, and so people optimizing for that are going to put a lot of text on the page, factual accuracy be damned. In the naughts, their metric used to be that many sites linked to yours, and so people optimized that by creating webrings. reply LtWorf 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you call \"working\" showing me an endless stream of blogs of some dude, an automatically translated russian clone of stackoverflow, a completely unrelated stackoverflow question, above the actual official documentation that it should be showing me… sure then it works. reply photonthug 9 hours agorootparentTo me what this shows is that it&#x27;s really painful to try and use an \"intelligent\" algorithm for \"content mediation\" as if it were an actual search engine. Anything that spectacularly fails the \"exact substring match\" use-case is well on the way to becoming a content-mediator, and potentially as bad a content-moderator&#x2F;thought-police&#x2F;etc.Unfortunately even before anyone started talking about \"semantic web\" or whatever, substring-match was declining in utility due to spam, so a substring-matcher was only as useful as it&#x27;s ranking algorithm. So some cleverness in ranking is necessary, but when ranking becomes too clever, or irrelevant due to the arms race with spam, it&#x27;s an almost inevitable slide from necessary rankers to mediators.Since all the search&#x2F;spam arms race is pretty much played out with giants like twitter&#x2F;google anyway at this point, it is kind of hard to understand why we can&#x27;t get and keep a separate and truly basic internet search engine that just works. I don&#x27;t have a handy example, but in my experience even DDG & friends seem to routinely fail the \"exact substring match\" test for unusual phrases that I know I read verbatim last week.What I (and I think others) really want is just substring-match tool plus a very minimal amount of extra cleverness for basic stuff like spelling variations, some fuzzing for dates&#x2F;digits, directly adjacent stuff according to a simple thesaurus. Not my area of expertise, but I would guess that there&#x27;s a combination of problems that prevent this tool from existing.a) Other search companies are all trying to do fancy-but-fuzzy \"semantic distance\" searches to emulate Googleb) It&#x27;s still true in 2023 that just keeping an up to date index is a super hard problem no matter how many crawlers are in your armyc) Despite bots everywhere, the deeper web in social-media is just too login-walled for the rule-abiding crawlers to deal withd) There&#x27;s just no money in do-what-i-say-not-what-i-mean search tools reply galangalalgol 8 hours agorootparentDDG seems unusually susceptible to highly ranking AI-generated overly verbose garbage.

If you search for anything slightly obscure in a language like Java, you&#x27;ll get dozens of spam sites aimed at beginners that answer a much more basic question than the one you asked. That&#x27;s because Java searches cater to a large population of people who can barely code. reply jrumbut 5 hours agorootparentJava is particularly rough because there are several populations of Java users (students, Android developers, enterprise developers, among others) and their coding standards are universes apart. reply THENATHE 9 hours agorootparentprevIf I wanted the docs, I would get the docs. The blogs are useful because the documentation is largely unhelpful due to being overly simplicity or extremely nondescript.

Most bootcamp&#x2F;academy&#x2F;coder-type blogs&#x2F;copycats are aimed at giving only a tiny fraction of the information, but with examples (sometimes only very simple ones that cover only the most basic use-cases, and no links or mention of the other missing 90% of information (e.g.: \"to read more about regexes, see ...\").\"site:docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F; term\" gets much better results. (You have to add the site: qualifier, due to SEO it&#x27;s no longer just enough to say \"Python docs\". Hence \"If I wanted the docs, I would get the docs.\" is not as trivial to do as you suggest. Things actually went beyond annoying to downright dangerous when searches for \"Python 3.10 \" were drowned out by older e.g. (3.6-3.8) version SEO stuff, instead of the latest Python docs.)Queries like \"awk by example\" or \"egrep by example\" or \"jq by example\" seem to hit the sweetspot between completeness and working example: they give you third-party non-commercial unaffiliated expert bloggers not stuffed with upsell links to a bootcamp.

Google search is not a knowledge finder for power users, it&#x27;s a content finder for normal people. The fact that it was good at finding knowledge for 10 years or so is entirely incidental to the goals of modern Google. reply wslh 10 hours agorootparentprevGoogle does not work.

That’s true even telling it to include ones omitted as redundant. They’re all either your HN comments or blogs mirroring them. The original doesn’t appear.That tells me that the main problem may simply be that the BugTraq post on seclists.org isn’t indexed by Google at all.While that’d be annoying, I think it’d more likely be a specific configuration or robots.txt issue with that site than being a general issue with how searches are performed.FWIW, the same query in Kagi found the original as the second result, just under a blog mirror of your 10&#x2F;20 comment and above the comment itself. Since Kagi sources from Bing (along with Google) results, that reinforces the theory that it’s an issue specific to Google’s crawl.Contrary to your other replies, I do think your style of query continues to work well on Google (where indexed of course)—-and so do full sentences.I honestly think the issues when there are problems finding things usually come more down to 25-plus years of searchable internet history accreting a lot of clutter (especially in spaces like tech where old info ages out but never gets deleted), along with cynical SEO from low value sites deliberately skewing results for as long as the site remains indexed.Neither is a Google problem, and the recency bias you observed is arguably the best way to combat both. Ads and site promotion are another story, and the reason I’m on Kagi, but I don’t think that hits tech as hard as consumer spaces. reply loveparade 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, you&#x27;re missing the point of the poster above you. He&#x27;s saying that the kind of technical searches you are trying to do are irrelevant to 99.99% of internet users and Google is optimized to give superficial but relevant-looking results to those kinds of people. For that metric Google does \"work well\"So it&#x27;s not that Google doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s that you&#x27;re using the wrong tool for your use case.

Where it really breaks down is where it used to shine—finding obscure information about highly technical niche topics. Its obsession with guessing synonyms (and ignoring your efforts to tell it to knock it off) is a major handicap for finding any content with a target audience smaller than a few million people, and while stripping out advanced search operators may smooth the path for the 80th percentile of searches, it cripples the remaining 20 percent.If your assistant stays firmly within the 80% that work, then yeah, Google is better than ever. But they made the 80% work seamlessly by giving up entirely on the 20% that people on forums like this really cared about. reply Ferret7446 2 hours agorootparentThat \"finding obscure information about highly technical niche topics\" needs to actually exist on the Web and not on the dark Web; that is, linked from somewhere so a search engine can crawl it.That is generally no longer true, due to human nature and the rise of walled platforms and&#x2F;or non-Web platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Medium, Mastodon, Reddit, etc. Most content is either private, or public as part of an offhand comment&#x2F;discussion thread. Actual public pages with high quality content are near extinct.In the few cases where it may be true, the results are sorted for the common denominator, especially since most people who would be looking for such niche information have disabled personalization, so Google can only assume that you are an average person who wants common denominator results. reply Wowfunhappy 9 hours agorootparentprev> Its obsession with guessing synonyms (and ignoring your efforts to tell it to knock it off) is a major handicapI know people say it still doesn&#x27;t work, but I find adding quotes completely effective for me when I need the precise keyword.

Look only for |||?\". I tried it again, and it did the same thing. I switched from Google to Google Image Search and watched it in real time delete that last letter from the search bar where I&#x27;d typed the term in. I went to show an acquaintance immediately after, only for the behaviour not to repeat itself.

But I see the change more as:You used to go to Google and effectively be asking, “Google, find me information about X.” Today you’re implicitly asking, “Google, show me ads related to X.” You just kind of accept that what it shows you will be the thing that is most fine tuned to appear most related to X - and the most common reason to do that fine tuning in the first place is to deliver an ad.So you gotta search in natural language like an ad, and hope that someone in that first page of results decided to SEO some particularly good content so they could get you there to look at more ads. reply wildrhythms 11 hours agoparentprevHow would you have phrased that query? reply fsckboy 10 hours agorootparentunlike some of the houses that show up in that query, this house was not designed to appear melting, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was even designed to look uneven, or had the foundation settled and they did nothing about it?

When I was young, I would expect most of the information about say a particularly weird house comes from the website of the owner of the house, or maybe a blogger who is into local architecture, if its on the internet at all. In that context it makes sense to try to query with what you think the owner would self-describe as (so like find out what the proper name of the style is, then query with that). If you come from an era where most of the stuff on the internet is people talking about or sharing the minority of original content, it makes more sense to query using terms that the casual viewer of the house would use. reply Waterluvian 10 hours agoparentprevThe problem I have is that I need a way to just get webpage results.

Google Maps is an index: you enter a query, like \"Thai restaurant near $location\", and it shows you Thai restaurants in that location. Then, you can look at some of those restaurants&#x27; listings and see photos (usually uploaded by customers, but some from the business), pictures of menus (same), opening hours, a link to their website, etc.I don&#x27;t see how any of that qualifies as \"advertising\"; it&#x27;s just a business directory. It certainly isn&#x27;t \"unsolicited advertising\". The same goes for the old Yellow Pages: it was a business directory (though it had ads too). Businesses had to pay to be listed in it, but that&#x27;s the cost of doing business: if people can&#x27;t find you, you&#x27;re not going to make any money.I think when people say they hate advertising, what they really mean is unsolicited ads.

Not exactly dying as indicated here in the HN circles because obviously HN crowd is much further ahead in the curve. SEO is still the number one opted channel by most ecommerce stores because keywords like \"red party dress\" or \"green shoes\" are still immensely more valuable and bring ton of revenue every day.Ofcourse, Google is trying hard to monetize every little real estate but still a ton of keywords don&#x27;t have any advertisers at all. Optimizing for these has been the number#1 revenue maker in the past 3 years.The other aspect of this the \"paid ads\" also immensely valuable to advertisers.

The increase in users, let them \"monetize\" by convincing \"sponsors\" to \"pay\" for content on this new \"platform\", which netted them a big chunk of profit and more money for more ad-spend which made more users come.Next up, they will brand and sell this platform which has \"X-millions of users\", even though most are one-off users, barely any repeat or long-term users, etc.It&#x27;s like some sort of endless shit-peddling cycle driven by marketing, and it was frankly disgusting to watch from the sides.

Younger people who weren&#x27;t that into computers mainly used them to message their friends on AIM and pirate music on Napster then Kazaa then Limewire (the platforms kept getting shut down). In the post-2008 world, Facebook replaced email and AIM and Spotify&#x2F;Netflix replaced piracy. The difference is, the people who used to just use the internet for email now spend far more time online because Facebook is designed to be addicting. reply no_wizard 11 hours agoparentprevThis perhaps, is some rose colored glasses.I remember friends getting harassed online, where it was one of the few places they could be themselves (for instance, a good friend of mine was openly gay online well before he was in person) and the internet seemingly didn&#x27;t take kindly to this in alot of corners (gaming for starters)That said, they were able to find some community that didn&#x27;t exist the same locally, so the vastness is the upside here in that respect. reply drivebycomment 11 hours agoparentprevThe Internet is more useful than it ever was for a lot more people.

I don&#x27;t think the real problem are two-bit hustlers sneaking in bait-and-switch content here and there - it&#x27;s that Google&#x27;s own rules encourage mediocre and non-authoritative content.So one of the reasons people gravitate towards ChatGPT (or, to a similar degree TikTok) is that both will give you strong and authoritative advice (even if it&#x27;s wrong!)I don&#x27;t necessarily believe the internet is worse today (if you have any false nostalgia, try searching a forum for an answer to a technical problem).

Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll likely be seen as a dinosaur in tech by that age and will be lucky to find work at all.I imagine your wife will be seen the same way.

Instead I would be losing sleep repairing the mistakes from bad decisions and lack of experience which would ultimately lead to a dead startup. Thank you no.There was a time when machismo was my middle name (much younger) and would have seen that as necessary for a successful startup.

Ageism in healthcare probably starts at around 80 and at that point it&#x27;s only because the doctor&#x27;s not physically able to perform safely. reply randomdata 2 hours agorootparentThanks to compound interest, the money you can save early in life is exponentially more important than the money you can make later in life.Many programmers started making money to invest in their teens, and save those who pursued other careers before pivoting, all were making money to invest by the time they are in their early 20s. Meanwhile, the doctors were racking up the debt until nearing 30. That decade plus is a huge setback – never mind the debt burden on top, and how the tax code greatly favours those who build up savings over a long period over receiving large lump sums in a single year.In other words, 55 year old programmers are talking about retiring because they can. 55 year old doctors on the other hand, even with a higher income, need to work decades more to financially catch up. reply dools 11 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the case that experience is generally useless, but you need far fewer experienced people like this than you do cannon fodder to advance the front line a couple of centimetres.There are people earning good scratch well into their \"golden years\" in the tech sector, but the demand for them is much weaker. reply taneq 10 hours agorootparentIsn’t that always the way?

A silver lining is that the tech industry is just so much larger now than it was when we started, a trend I think will continue, and there are now tons of jobs where it’s really helpful to also be a developer. Some examples:Developer and marketer&#x2F;technical writer - selling to other devs is a giant business now and it often takes devs to make that content.Developer and SRE - we live in the world of huge scaled our saas businesses where there are always support issues too advanced to be handled by non-devsDeveloper and project manager - everybody has worked with non-dev project managers and it’s usually terrible.Developer and people manager - there are so many more eng manager roles than there used to be, and moving to the management side is a well worn path now.Developer and product manager - you have to develop a lot of new skills but in this role a past life as a developer can give you super powers.That said, I moved first into people management and then into running a small software company which sort of demands a little bit of all of those skills reply Terr_ 13 hours agorootparent> I’m 41 and I totally understand this sentiment.

Yes you might get agism at trendy companies started by and heavily employing young people, but there are many software companies out there with many industries now employing software divisions, and the heavy demand I always see is for senior developers with experience.One “problem” in software: it’s really difficult to coast for a long period of time without training up new skills. You can certainly do it, but eventually the industry shifts underneath you. So the cushy senior Java dev position in a particular service might be able to last you for a decade or more at some companies, but I think most developers agree that if you want to keep getting better salaries you need to stay on top of trends and keep reeducating yourself.And I don’t really see this as a problem as much as a feature of tech, but if you’re looking for predictability in a career I think it’s a tough thing to get in tech. reply SystemOut 12 hours agorootparentprevI think the ageism thing is not as big of an issue anymore. Yes, you will see it in startups that are run by 20somethings but I&#x27;m in my early 50s and haven&#x27;t had any problem staying employed or getting offers.If you stagnate skills wise or stop trying to grow&#x2F;evolve your abilities then you definitely will have issues but that&#x27;s true in many industries, not just ours. reply ido 5 hours agorootparentAs someone whose done a lot of hiring (at several companies), senior devs with a lot of (applicable) experience can always find work even if they’re “old” (40&#x2F;50&#x2F;60+).But career changers will have a rough time - e.g. I remember a social worker who went back to school in his late 30s looking for an internship(as a developer), he had a much harder time getting hired than someone in the same position in their early 20s. reply faeriechangling 7 hours agorootparentprevNot to sound like a naive optimist, but the average age of somebody working in tech is going up over time, and that is likely going to make tech less exceptional in its ageism.Tech is also slowing down in how much it is changing, which makes it easier to do the work while older, which again takes the edge off of ageism. reply alephnerd 9 hours agorootparentprev> Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll likely be seen as a dinosaur in tech by that age and will be lucky to find work at allMy dad is in his 60s and is still doing cutting edge work on Kubernetes, Golang, eBPF, etc in a big tech company in the Bay Area.

Adjusted for inflation, that is around $42,000 today. Interestingly, the median income in the USA is $41,535, so it is likely that half of all Americans are in the top 1%.Although I would think that \"good money\" would cast a larger net than just the top 1%. Surely at least a 75th percentile income would be considered \"good\" by most? As such, it is likely that a $20-30,000 income is \"good money\".If you have not even made that much at some point over the past 25 or so years that you have been of working age, how can you afford to be here? reply lnsru 13 hours agorootparentprevJoin the club.

The current pilot shortage was by design, as the airlines were well aware of the issue and had many ways to avoid it.

If a lawsuit it filed, discovery is a powerful tool in litigation to help gather evidence that is generally required to prove the claim. Often this will be data about the other employees they have let go or in the case you weren&#x27;t hired the age of the person ultimately hired and those that were interviewed but not hired.There are about 10,000-15,000 a year, like all areas of law probably about 90% settle pre-trial. reply kcplate 7 hours agorootparentMy point is that I don’t think it’s that easy to prove unless it’s blatantly obvious from an outside perspective and most lawyers wouldn’t take a case on contingency unless it was blatantly obvious to them that it was a winner.So do you pursue it paying some lawyer an hourly rate to sift through a thousand emails just to find that the company hired a younger but still fully qualified candidate?

The hard bit is responding to equipment failures and other emergencies. There is no way to predict all of the possible failure modes, nor do we have AI that can figure out how to manage unexpected problems in real time. That technology is likely at least several decades away.There is also a sensing issue. If aircraft sensors fail then they might feed the AI faulty data. And sensor redundancy or fault detection logic can&#x27;t necessarily cope with that.

Electrics and gas plumbing carry a certification requirement because an error can kill someone, but it’s easier than passing a driving test.Obviously, there are higher tiers of those trades that require a lot more training, but even those aren’t really comparable to the level of knowledge and study needed to become a qualified doctor, let alone a consultant.In the UK, shortages of tradespeople are less to do with the difficulty of training, or lack of course capacity, and more to do with people really just not wanting to do the job, for various reasons. reply lesam 14 hours agorootparentMedicine has more barriers to entry at least partly because we’ve decided to erect them.

The best time for staff to start training more staff was before they ran out of staff. The next best time is now.The rub is that lack of staff isn&#x27;t what prevents this, nor is even lack of staff time. It&#x27;s a conscious, short-term-focused decision by hospitals to focus efforts outwards on making more money, rather than inwards on training or changing the status quo.

Competency is almost entirely driven by clinical volumes and exposure, you don&#x27;t train to handle the 90% of normal cases but the 9% that are challenging and the 1% that&#x27;s incredibly complex. If you&#x27;re not working long hours (or spending many more years in training) chances are you won&#x27;t get that exposure.With that said one could argue with the current expectation that everyone does 1-2 fellowships we&#x27;re already training longer.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;William_Stewart_Halsted reply alephnerd 7 hours agorootparentprevA residency is direct care of a patient.

I know there will still be medical experts and surgeons and so forth, but much of this medical infrastructure doesn&#x27;t benefit the average citizen (I know there&#x27;s an argument that it does or for a change in perspective, but that&#x27;s a whole different can of worms.Similar to policing, if you think of the typical way you interact with the medical system, you start to realize there&#x27;s very little in there to help you. 99.99% of the infrastructure is built to benefit powerful people with tons of money; helping you is an after thought.What happens when you&#x27;re a victim of crime?

I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, just explaining why some people are asking questions; if you honestly think about it, your naive assumptions about safety and health will be shattered.A doctor, in many ways, arguably has a patients WORST interests at heart, in a similar manor to a police officer, in it&#x27;s interaction with the public. They have, as their most important responsibilities, to detect certain things, and take actions to hurt the person.This is priority #1, virtually everything else comes after.

Meanwhile a bad or apathetic doctor, policeman, etc. will tend to receive little friction for it while you have to fight uphill to get basic care, all while being milked of as much of your money as possible and still having to wait unbearably long for useful treatment.Likewise, there&#x27;s such a range of outcomes, and when it&#x27;s involving chronic diseases combined with an apathetic or bad doctor, you can be stuck realizing you&#x27;ve wasted months with no resolution (not even getting into any potential costs) only to now have to start all over again potentially several more times just for a sliver of hope that you&#x27;ll find a doctor who&#x27;s caring and competent enough to finally help you out. So sitting on the receiving end feels like being bled dry by people who couldn&#x27;t care less about your suffering or if you die, so long as you keep paying them, with little realistic recourse other than accepting that you got burned and moving on.In any case, just my two cents from what I think seems like a somewhat related view but with a different \"spin\". reply robocat 13 hours agorootparentprev> We&#x27;re all gonna need medical help some day...95% of health is being proactive about your health: food, fitness, sleep, dentist, etcetera.I wonder how much doctoring is due to negligence of a healthy lifestyle, or perhaps chronic choices (addictive substances like alcohol, shift-work).> But we&#x27;re all going to have severe medical problems at some point.Which often are untreatable - and the doctoring is regularly prophylactic.

Numerous studies have indicated that a diet too rich in red meat and processed foods can heighten the risk of bowel cancer. However I would guess the percentage amount you can lower your risk by is below 1%. Across all health outcomes, healthy food choices and a daily walk can have a large effect overall.It seems to me a hell of a lot of our healthcare funding goes towards people that make no preventative effort towards health. I have friends and acquittances with chronic conditions due to alcohol (diabetes, excessive obesity, gout, Korsikov&#x27;s, accidents), smoking (emphysema, cancers), severely damaged joints (impact sports, car accidents), drugs (hepC, OD, teeth, accidents and worse).Personally I eat \"risky\" foods , occasionally I drink excessively, I heartily enjoy high risk sports and activities, and I definitely don&#x27;t exercise enough. I am not trying to preach: my point is many close their eyes to known risks.I certainly am not blaming your cancer on your lifestyle. I sincerely hope the best for remission.> I didn&#x27;t have insurance, $800kI&#x27;m in New Zealand and our taxes pay for reasonable quality cancer care for all - probably not $800k worth often. The sticker price for the US insurance system is often grossly[1] overstated (for reasons). I&#x27;ve seen our healthcare system mostly work (and I&#x27;ve seen some failures too).[1] e.g. Hospital billed $100K, insurance negotiated to about $20K.

I am saying I know plenty of acquantances that have made difficult choices to improve their lifestyle choices (presuming cause not correlation), and others that have not made positive changes.Context: I&#x27;m in New Zealand, so healthcare is mostly free and of reasonable quality.

Genetics play a huge role. You will likely need a doctor if your family has a long history of cancer. reply didgetmaster 8 hours agoparentprevSame here. I am a programmer with a wife who is a doctor. It took her about 12 years after she started her practice before her total earnings surpassed mine.One thing that rarely discussed in this kind of conversation is taxes. A doctor spends 12 years earning next to nothing and going into debt for training costs. Then the second they start making a real doctor salary, the IRS thinks they are &#x27;rich&#x27;. They are taxed at the highest tax bracket even though it might take them another 10 years to surpass someone who was earning barely a six-figure salary the whole time.If you spend 9 years earning nothing and then make $1M in your tenth year, you will pay much more taxes than someone earning $100K for 10 years (even though both earned a total of $1M over those 10 years). reply Hextinium 5 hours agorootparentNot to mention that most retirement accounts have yearly maximums, if you where making 401k for 10 years at 100k you will have significantly lower effective taxes than a person who made nothing and then sees high earnings trying to put into retirement. reply ska 14 hours agoparentprev> salaries need to offset the insane burden of trainingA cycle here is that student loans rise with expected earnings and banks are fairly open ended about it, institutions happy to justify the use of the cash.Salaries wouldn&#x27;t need to be nearly as high if you didn&#x27;t walk out of residency with 200k+ [medical school ] debt at a point that is effectively mid-career. As a society we&#x27;d probably be better off if the both the median salary and median debt was much lower. I&#x27;ve also seen the \"guarantee\" of a high salary later lead many young doctors and med students to be foolish with money, as \"eh, what&#x27;s a little more debt\" is easy to fall into.It&#x27;s also part of the driver to overspecialization, more available GP&#x27;s and fewer people reliant on emergency visits would obviously improve the system, but the economics and QOL for a general practice keep getting harder.Residency bottleneck and the high barrier for foreign trained mid-career people are the two other areas for potentially major impact. reply HPsquared 14 hours agorootparentThe question is, does it really cost 200k to train each doctor? Surely the main input is the student&#x27;s own time and effort, which isn&#x27;t even included. reply jltsiren 9 hours agorootparentIt probably costs more than that.As a baseline, university education in Finland costs about €10k&#x2F;year on the average. Medical education is more expensive than the average, probably between €15k and €20k a year. Universities in the US are generally better funded than those in Finland, which allows them to provide more personal attention to the students. And university salaries are higher in the US than in Finland.Overall, I would estimate something like $20k&#x2F;year for the undergraduate degree and $30k to $40k&#x2F;year for the medical school, for a total of $200k to $240k. And that&#x27;s just for the education, not including costs of living as a student. reply HEmanZ 7 hours agorootparentSounds great, but my wife’s state-funded public medical school cost $85k&#x2F;yr usd before cost of living.There are a handful of state medical schools near the $40k&#x2F;r, but they are on the much cheaper end reply jltsiren 7 hours agorootparentI was estimating the costs of providing the education, not the prices of getting it. (The latter would be €0&#x2F;year in Finland.)

The 200k is just the median residual debt from medical school alone. People don&#x27;t tend to pay it off much during residency years though, since residency pay is relatively low (50-70k). Lots of them acquire extra personal debt during residency. Doctors aren&#x27;t typically considered \"trained\" until after residency. reply strikelaserclaw 14 hours agoparentprevWho knows if software engineers will be paid the same in the future but doctors will most likely have a strong \"moat\" till the day they die.

We&#x27;re already seeing the beginnings of it.Essentially, physicians have been so bottlenecked for so long that a bunch of states has simply said \"screw it\" and started paving the way for mid-levels (NPs and PAs) to operate in certain roles physicians have previously covered.

Once you design a machine, you can build it an infinite number of times. However, in neither case does the labour scale. One engineer, whether their focus be on software or mechanical, can only do so much in a day.Software engineers lucked out in this era because it is a new, relative to other industries, field that saw a rapid rise in demand for labour, with comparatively few people able to fulfill the need for that labour.

It is highly doubtful that engineers will continue to benefit into the long future.

It no doubt brings a leap forward in approachability, like Javascript was a leap forward from assembly, but at the end of the day it still relies on programmers to use it. No matter how advanced it becomes, as long as it exists to serve the interests of humans, and not other machines, it is going to require programmers to describe what humans want to see carried out.It is possible that everyone will become a programmer, like everyone has become an elevator operator, but unlike an elevator button press that takes milliseconds and you&#x27;re done, does it behoove \"the boss\" to spend their day describing their ideas to GPT?

Web Developer Autofill Exclusion: Web Development contributors can now prevent the Browser Extension from auto-filling a given form element by adding a data-bwignore attribute (e.g. data-bwignore=\"true\") to anelement. 2021-05-11 The Bitwarden team is pleased to release a set of features and updates continuing our mission of making password management easy and accessible for individuals and businesses: Privacy & Security Options for Send: Use a new Send Privacy option to hide your email from recipients (see here for details). To prevent abuse, File Sends will now require a verified email address. Additionally, Enterprise Organizations can implement a new policy to set the availability of the Hide Email option (see here for details). FIDO Updates & Expanded Support: Our FIDO implementation has been upgraded from FIDO U2F to FIDO2 WebAuthn, but existing FIDO U2F keys will retain their integrity. FIDO support has been expanded to more Browser Extensions and the Windows Desktop App (see here for details). Custom Fields for Keys: Custom Field values have been upgraded to support up to 5000 characters, allowing storage of keys like RSA 4096-bit SSH keys (see here for details). File Size Increases: You can now create File Attachments or File Sends that are up to 500 MB each. Due to device restrictions, the old 100 MB limit is still in place for Mobile Apps.  Warning As a result of the Attachment upgrade, Attachments uploaded on the newest clients cannot be opened on older client versions. If you find you're unable to access a recently-created Attachment, upgrade your client to the newest version. (Hint: The Cloud Web Vault is always on the newest version.) Frozen or legacy client versions, including the Safari 13 (or earlier) macOS Desktop App & App Extension, will not support accessing these attachments. Disable Browser Extension Counter: Disable the Browser Extension badge counter using a new toggle in the  Settings → Options menu (see here for details). Biometrics for Safari: The Safari Web Extension now includes support for Unlock with Biometrics for Safari 14+ (see here for details). Search Internationalization: Vaults can now be searched against 1 character, improving the experience for languages with 1-character words like Simplified and Traditional Chinese. Sorted Weak Passwords Report: The Weak Passwords Report is now sorted by the severity of the password's weakness (see here for details)  Tip Since implementing Soft Delete back in 2020, we've been patient to take out the Trash. Starting 5/15/2021, we'll activate the nightly job that will permanently delete items that have been in your trash for 30 days or more. Prior to 5/15/2021, we recommend digging through your Trash for anything you might want to Restore! 2021-03-11 Bitwarden is proud to announce the release of Bitwarden Send, and end-to-end encrypted solution for ephemeral sharing. This release includes: Bitwarden Send: Bitwarden Send is end-to-end encrypted solution for ephemeral sharing. There's lot of material about Send on our website and Help Center, but you can start here or here. FIDO U2F Support for Edge: Two-step Login via FIDO U2F is now available for the Web Vault and Browser Extensions in Microsoft Edge (see here for details). Domain Exclusion in Browser Extensions: Bitwarden Browser Extensions can now be configured with domains to explicitly not offer to remember passwords for (see here for details). Improved Import Error Messages: We've had lots of folks migrating to Bitwarden recently, so we cleaned up an import error message to help you reconcile issues faster (see here for details). Safari Web Extension Port: Our Safari App Extension has officially been ported to a Web Extension for use with Safari 14+. Due to changes to Safari, Web Extension use is now limited to only those obtained through Mac App Store downloads (see here for details). 2021-01-19 Post-Release Update  Note Biometric Unlock for Browser Extensions is available for only Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge) with v1.48.0 of the Browser Extension, provided you have the latest version (2021-01-19) of the Desktop App. When your Browser Extension updates to this version, you may be asked to accept a new permission for Bitwarden to Communicate with cooperating native applications. This permission is safe, but optional, and will enable the Browser Extension to communicate with the Bitwarden Desktop App, which is required to enable Biometric Unlock (see here for details). Declining this permission will allow you to use v1.48.0 without Biometric Unlock functionality. Biometric Unlock is currently not available for: Firefox Browser Extensions below version 87. Microsoft App Store Desktop Apps (a side-loaded Windows Desktop App, available at bitwarden.com/download/ will work fine). Side-loaded MacOS Desktop Apps (an App Store Desktop app will work fine). The Bitwarden team is investigating these and will provide updates as things progress. 2021-01-19 For the first major release of 2021, the Bitwarden team combined multiple major enhancements to address the critical needs of all users, including: Emergency Access: Bitwarden's new Emergency Access feature enables users to designate and manage trusted emergency contacts, who may request access to their Vault in a zero knowledge encryption environment (see here for details).here Encrypted Exports: Personal users and Organizations can now export Vault data in an encrypted .json file (see here for details). New Role: A Custom role is now available to allow for granular control over user permissions (see here for details). New Enterprise Policy: The Personal Ownership policy is now available for use by Enterprise Organization (see here for details). Biometric Unlock for Browser Extensions: Using an integration with a native Desktop application, you can now use Biometric input to unlock Chromium-based Browser Extensions (see here for details). 2020-11-12 The latest release of Bitwarden adds SSO-related enhancements to all client applications, including: New Enterprise Policies: The Single Organization and Single Sign-On Authentication polices are now available for use by Enterprise Organizations (see here for details). API Key for CLI: Authenticate into the Bitwarden CLI using an API Key newly available from your Web Vault (see here for details). Improvements to SSO Onboarding: We've made some improvements to the way users are onboarded via SSO to prevent potential security risks (see here for details). GDPR Acknowledgement: From now on, new users of Bitwarden will be asked to acknowledge a Privacy Policy on registration. Android 11 Inline Auto-fill: For devices using Android 11+, enabling the Auto-fill Service will display suggestions inline for IMEs that also support this feature (see here for details). 2020-9-30 The latest release of Bitwarden adds much-anticipated Login with SSO functionality for all client applications, and the Business Portal for Web Vaults. Read this blog post for more information about Login with SSO, and refer to our documentation. Early 2020 releases The following items were released between March and September of 2020.

That is why I don&#x27;t love it. I prefer a very long password, and Bitwarden \"Device login\" that will prompt in my iPhone that will require FaceID (So essentially I have bio login). And 2FA to lower hacking chances. I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m still vulnerable to phishing but because there is no export, this is a marriage to Bitwarden. And as much as I love them... I&#x27;m not ready yet.But essentially it&#x27;s a certificate... so I wonder why no private key export? Maybe because current implementation uses some CA that binds you to the issuer?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitwarden.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;storing-passkeys&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redd.it&#x2F;143acl5 reply jerf 13 hours agoparentI hope they get over that. It&#x27;s a blob of data. It&#x27;s no more special than a TOTP secret or a conventional password, and I am completely uninterested in pretending otherwise because of a slick marketing campaign. It&#x27;s a \"thing I know\" whether anybody likes it or not and you can&#x27;t turn it into a \"thing I have\" just because you won&#x27;t let me export it from this particular software. (Proof that it is a \"thing I know\": It fits into Bitwarden, which is a \"thing I know\" storage mechanism. Anything that can be stored by BitWarden is a thing-I-know.) As long as it&#x27;s a thing I know you might as well give me the benefits of being a thing I know, since I&#x27;m paying the costs of it anyhow.I back up at the Vaultwarden backend store level anyhow. Probably shouldn&#x27;t give me that sort of advantage over the commercial option. reply noman-land 9 hours agorootparentI see this common refrain from people. How is writing something down so that you don&#x27;t have to remember it a \"thing you know\"? You literally don&#x27;t know it. A \"thing you know\" never leaves your brain, otherwise it becomes a \"thing you have\". reply jerf 9 hours agorootparentIt comes from the fact there are three fundamental ways to authenticate: a thing you know, a thing you have, a thing you are. You may not \"know\" a passkey or a TOTP token, but you are using computers in their most fundamental role as bicycles for the mind to \"know\" them for you. This means they still fit into \"thing you know\".Clearly a TOTP token is not a thing you are.Less clearly, it is not a thing you have. Passkeys and TOTP tokens \"want\" to be a thing you have, but in the end they aren&#x27;t. My little proof in my parent post may be small, but I&#x27;m quite serious... if you can store it in a password manager, that is proof that it is a thing you know, not a thing you have.It turns out making a \"thing you have\" be a true thing you have is very difficult. It may even be impossible, in some sense. Everything that is a \"thing you have\" seems to be a thing you know masquerading as a thing you have through some security-through-obscurity.Between that and the fact that \"thing you are\" has incredibly poor, if not outright dangerous characteristics if you try to scale it up, I&#x27;m actually not on board with the \"passwords suck because things-you-know suck and we must replace them immediately!\" I think they whole argument stinks of a classic engineering mistake of considering only the pros of one option and only the cons of another. I think when you take a holistic view, \"thing you know\" is the only practical, scalable option of the three basic options. If passkeys make it easier, fine, I&#x27;m up for some improvement, but I&#x27;m not on board the \"passkeys must be a thing you have\" and I fully intend to use them as things I know as much as I can and have no intention of letting anyone make my passkeys into objects. reply unethical_ban 7 hours agorootparentYep. Thing you have is a passkey that can&#x27;t be copied at all, like a yuibikey, some physical manifestation that can&#x27;t be easily cloned. Arguably TOTP is \"have\" due to being linked to a phone when doing push to a single device. reply lolinder 6 hours agorootparentNit: TOTP doesn&#x27;t include push methods of 2FA, it specifically refers to the algorithm for producing one-time passcodes from the current time and a secret key. reply Spivak 5 hours agorootparentprevTOTP is just PAKE with a funny way of writing the password.We tricked people into using actually secure passwords and password managers by calling it 2FA and devising a scheme where the human does the challenge and the server necessarily must keep that part of the password in plaintext, but in exchange the user doesn&#x27;t have to type out the long part of the password every time. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentNo, TOTP is a weaker version challenge-response authentication (with the challenge being time-based and not provided by the verifying&#x2F;challenging party).PAKEs do significantly more; in particular, they are MITM resistant (unlike TOTPs) and provide mutual authentication. reply addicted 6 hours agorootparentprevAny half decent sophisticated user on the internet has not remembered passwords for half a decade at least.Nearly everyone is storing it in password managers.So has that changed passwords into not being “thing you know”? reply noman-land 6 hours agorootparentnext [–]So has that changed passwords into not being “thing you know”?Yes? If you write your password down on a piece of paper it becomes something you have, no? reply afiori 7 minutes agorootparentProtocol-wise the difference is that a TYH* requires an interaction by the user.An app generating OTP codes is a TYH while the secret used to generate the token is a TYK.A password manager is a TYH while the passwords inside are TYKIn general every (non-quantum) TYH possess some kind of TYK that can be used to duplicate the TYH.In the name of security sometimes there are locks around the TYK, sometimes physical other times software.In the case of passkeys the inability to export them makes them TYH.* \"Thing you have\" is too long reply charcircuit 4 hours agorootparentprevThe server is not checking if you have a piece of paper. It is checking if you can produce a piece of information.If someone steals your paper, copies the password to their phone, and then returns your paper, then the attacker can log in without that piece of paper. In a true \"something you have\" if you have that something then it is impossible for someone to login to your account. reply afiori 0 minutes agorootparentI agree with the general sentiment but every non-quantum \"thing you have\" can be duplicated.PS: I suspect that you could make a 2FA protocol capable of detecting duplication of the thing you have by having the app generate signed codes like \"this is the n-th code I have generated\" and have the server remember the n as a logical clock to detect duplicates and \"time travel\".AFAIK only bank-type apps would use something this sophisticatedSheinhardtWigCo 12 hours agorootparentprevIt is special - it should be a reference to an asymmetric key stored in hardware. But it&#x27;s not clear whether they are actually doing this. reply ryan29 12 hours agorootparentSome snippets from the FAQ [1].> The public key is stored on the website and the private key is stored on your device or in your passkey provider, e.g. your Bitwarden Vault.> Passkeys are often able to sync across your devices, however not all platforms support this yet.So it sounds like it&#x27;s not stored in hardware. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it works if solutions that use a TPM or similar start to emerge. I have nearly 1000 passwords and many of them are shared with colleagues, parents, siblings, etc.. I can&#x27;t even imagine a way you could make that work if the private key is owned by a TPM (aka a hardware bound key) and needs to be enrolled somehow prior to becoming usable.What happens if I have 500 passkeys backed by keys in a TPM and I get a new computer?1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitwarden.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;passkeys-faq&#x2F; reply tw04 11 hours agorootparent> What happens if I have 500 passkeys backed by keys in a TPM and I get a new computer?In theory the same thing that happens today with a yubikey - you have multiple devices with valid keys. reply Groxx 8 hours agorootparentprevA big part of passkeys is that they are (often) not in hardware, so they can be synced. reply SV_BubbleTime 12 hours agorootparentprevIf it is just a pointer a hardware, even more reason to let you export it. reply Racing0461 12 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. unless its stored in a tpm module or on an actual piece of hardware like a yubikey, no amount of software (especially a browser plugin written in javascript let alone low level drivers for an OS) can turn a \"thing i know\" into a \"thing i have\". reply SheinhardtWigCo 12 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re not really vulnerable to phishing if you use a password manager with a browser extension.Cross-platform import&#x2F;export for passkeys is considered a \"nice-to-have\" because you can always just add a new device via other established factors (email&#x2F;SMS).So, what&#x27;s the point, then? Why can&#x27;t passkeys just be strings that I can extract via biometric authentication?The answer: everyone pushing this has a significant interest in making it harder to migrate between operating systems and password managers.It&#x27;s a land grab. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparent> Why can&#x27;t passkeys just be strings that I can extract via biometric authentication?As much as that lock-in annoys me personally – I could absolutely see this become a tech support scam attack vector. \"Please share your passkey with us for authentication by going to your device&#x27;s settings and selecting the &#x27;export passkey&#x27; option\"...> you can always just add a new device via other established factors (email&#x2F;SMS)That gives the relying party some agency about requiring additional authentication to add devices though, of treating devices added under dubious circumstances as less trusted, or simply of sending a security notification to the customer.Exporting a passkey leaves no relying-party-side traces. reply SheinhardtWigCo 3 hours agorootparent> \"Please share your passkey with us for authentication by going to your device&#x27;s settings and selecting the &#x27;export passkey&#x27; option\"This doesn&#x27;t seem materially different from \"please go to your emails and find the six-digit code we just sent you\".> Exporting a passkey leaves no relying-party-side traces.Not if it&#x27;s only useful for getting a device-bound session token. Everything you listed is already commonplace. reply jesseendahl 2 hours agorootparent>This doesn&#x27;t seem materially different from \"please go to your emails and find the six-digit code we just sent you\".Exactly, that&#x27;s the problem lxgr is pointing out. Those six-digit codes can (and often are) phished by e.g. tech support scam attackers. lxgr is pointing out the same exact attack could be done against an exported passkey. reply jiveturkey 11 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;matduggan.com&#x2F;passkeys-as-a-tool-for-user-retention&#x2F;> It is also, as currently implemented, one of the most effective platform lock-ins I&#x27;ve ever seen. reply cheriot 9 hours agoparentprevMaybe the authors saw this comment because the page you link to says, \"A: Passkeys imports and exports will be included in a future release.\" reply lxgr 4 hours agoparentprev> But essentially it&#x27;s a certificate... so I wonder why no private key export? Maybe because current implementation uses some CA that binds you to the issuer?It&#x27;s a private key, not a certificate (at least not without using attestation).But there is currently no portable specification of WebAuthN credentials; each authenticator is free to implement its own storage backend, and in fact some hardware authenticators deterministically re-derive the private key from an internal secret and the key handle before each signature.Others store a randomly generated key in local storage, indexed by the key handle; yet others encrypt a randomly generated key and make that encrypted key part of the key handle.The point being: Not all implementations can even support key imports, and there&#x27;s no standardized serialization format for key exports yet. reply imran-iq 13 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s really a shame, I know keepassxc has (recently) added support for passkeys, but does it also support import&#x2F;exporting them? I only found this comment[0] in the github issue.EDIT: According to the pr[1] it does support import&#x2F;export---0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keepassxreboot&#x2F;keepassxc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1870#issu...1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keepassxreboot&#x2F;keepassxc&#x2F;pull&#x2F;8825 reply rstuart4133 11 hours agoparentprev> But essentially it&#x27;s a certificate...I&#x27;ll put upfront that I&#x27;m no expert in any of this, but ... unlike passwords and certificates, attestation is a thing for passkeys. The thing being attested to is \"the private key of this cert is being secured by X\". X might be YubiKey in the case of a FIDO2 key, or Google or Apple in the case of passkeys.This aspect of passkeys made me uncomfortable with them. If Google is going to attest they manage your passkey, then it follows the aren&#x27;t giving a copy to anybody, including you. That means if you lose your Google account you&#x27;ve lost control of your ID. But note: that&#x27;s control, not the keys themselves. You probably will have a copy of them on a phone, so you can still use them until that phone dies. But when it does you&#x27;ve in a world of pain because you can&#x27;t backup &#x2F; transfer &#x2F; copy them - only Google can do that. In effect you don&#x27;t own your Google passkey - Google does.I don&#x27;t know if Bitwarden does attestation now, or if the are planning to implement it in the future. But if either of those things are true they can&#x27;t give you a copy of the key, ever.This still makes me uncomfortable. But I can see why it is so. You and I may be capable of protecting a private key, but my mother and 99% of the rest of the planet aren&#x27;t. Your bank or whoever trusting me on my say so isn&#x27;t going to work, so the end result of us never being able to manage our own keys is inevitable. We have to put them in the hands of a 3rd party the bank or whoever can trust.And it is ameliorated by another aspect of FIDO2 &#x2F; passkeys: unlike passwords where you can only have one per site, sites are expected to support many FIDO2 keys for the same person. And, you are expected to keep several of them and authenticate each of them at every site you use. So you might have a Google one, and a Bitwarden one, and maybe even a Keypass one. If you did you solve the \"Google owns my ID\" problem, but it&#x27;s such a pain in the arse to do I don&#x27;t see it happening.We&#x27;ve seen several iterations of this concept: FIDO, WebAuthn&#x2F;FIDO2, and now passkeys. I&#x27;d like to see one more: some way of bundling up a whole pile of passkeys from different providers, so when I establish a new account on a web site, I register all of them. That would make maintaining a bunch of PassKeys trackable. Right now, the reality is bugger all people are going to do it. And as a consequence, a good chunk of the planet is going to end up with Apple &#x2F; Google &#x2F; whoever owning their identities. And of course some of them are going to lose their relationship they had with there ID manager, and wake up one day to discover themselves wiped from the digital planet. reply wkat4242 11 hours agorootparentI hate attestation with a passion. But luckily Apple has not implemented it and nobody wants to lock all Apple users out. So at least right now it&#x27;s not a thing in practice. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentApple used to support it for their non-synced platform credentials. They fortunately got rid of it for synchronized passkeys. reply briHass 8 hours agorootparentprevYep. The end game of this is that web applications will, either through laziness or a sense of &#x27;better security&#x27;, only accept passkeys attested by Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;MS and&#x2F;or those backed by TPM with non-exportable keys. You have to register with the FIDO Alliance to obtain an attestation GUID, and unsurprisingly, only the big guys are on the list: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;passkeydeveloper&#x2F;passkey-authenticator-aa...This move by Bitwarden clearly shows that they believe products that allow you to export&#x2F;backup your keys will be blackballed, so they played it safe and blocked that. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentMy government&#x27;s e-signing web application (which stores private keys on the vendor&#x27;s servers for all citizens, but that&#x27;s another story) already does that.It used to not even accept Yubikeys, only a fairly unknown other brand; now they finally do support Yubikeys, but only the \"FIDO L2\" certified kind, i.e. the FIDO and \"security key\" models, but not the most common plain Yubikey ones... reply pests 8 hours agorootparentprevIt does say it will come in a future version now.

If so, it seems like the worst of software lock-in. reply eviks 13 hours agoparentprevwhat&#x27;s the phishing risk if bitwarden autofills only on the correct domains stored in the vault? reply vorpalhex 12 hours agorootparentMobile apps, slightly tweaky domain names (which happens normally), much less fancy xss type attacks, plus general data exfil. reply eviks 12 hours agorootparentMobile BW app also wouldn&#x27;t fill a password for a different domain reply kiwijamo 10 hours agorootparentCan confirm this. Additionally, the Bitwarden app on mobiles also checks the app name (i.e. the &#x27;com.company.appname&#x27; not the &#x27;user friendly&#x27; name). It takes an extra step to &#x27;force&#x27; Bitwarden to use a username&#x2F;password if the name&#x2F;domain does not match the name&#x2F;domain(s) recorded against the username&#x2F;password which adds a nice bit of friction. reply josteink 12 hours agorootparentprev> what&#x27;s the phishing risk if bitwarden autofills only on the correct domains stored in the vault?The whole point of passkeys is that they should be tied to a specific domain, and thus be nonphisable.If Bitwarden allows reuse for different domains, that would be (as I understand it) a violation of the spec and a bug in their implementation. reply kiwijamo 10 hours agorootparentSilly question perhaps, but what happens if a certain website changes to a different domain. E.g. a takeover of Company B by Company A who then decides to migrate all Company B passkeys to Company A and removes assets hosted under the Company B domain. This is easily sorted with existing tools but with passkeys... how? reply pests 8 hours agorootparentIf they had time to prepare I&#x27;m sure they could develop a flow to get you a passkey on the new domain first. Similar to how YouTube used to do a bunch of cross-domain redirects (to plant cookies) to get Google+ login support back in the day. reply neurostimulant 6 hours agorootparentYou might not get a head up when you&#x27;re forced to change your domain though. For example, recently a huge number of .ml domains are dead and people that used them must scramble to migrate to another domain. The problem is some apps like mastodon (and now passkey) don&#x27;t support changing domains unless the old domain is still accessible. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentprevIt still wouldn&#x27;t be a security problem, since WebAuthN includes the hash of the visited domain in the signature.So even if Bitwarden would go blatantly out of spec and allow usage of a passkey created on and scoped to a.com on b.com, the assertion signature would effectively say \"I want to login to b.com\", which a.com would simply reject.That&#x27;s what makes it so much harder to phish than auto-filled passwords (which could still be MITMed e.g. through usage of attacker-installed TLS certificates). reply eviks 12 hours agorootparentprevThe question was about the password alternative the op was describing reply Racing0461 12 hours agoparentprev+1.

I happily pay for a subscription to support them. reply giarc 12 hours agorootparentMy biggest peeve is that if you search for a password and you happen to be in the \"Card\" category for example, it will return 0 results. A good alternative would be to show No Results for the category you are in, but then provide results for other categories below. reply corytheboyd 11 hours agorootparentYeah that gets me somewhat frequently too, and second the request you have.Another silly one is adding custom fields, you can’t change the type between visible&#x2F;hidden once it’s created, so if you mess up, you have to delete the custom field and add it with the desired visibility. Ughhh reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 4 hours agorootparentprevanother is that if you do a search then click on an entry and do another search, the entry details displayed and what&#x27;s in the search box don&#x27;t match and it&#x27;s not clear unless you&#x27;re paying attention. reply ramenmeal 14 hours agorootparentprevI moved over from Lastpass, I find the experience of filling in a password in Bitwarden more jarring&#x2F;slow than in Lastpass. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, maybe Lastpass had longer timeouts to require FaceID when filling a password? Bitwarden requires it every time. reply gregschlom 14 hours agorootparentThis is configurable in the settings. The default timeout is indeed too low and very annoying, but you can set it up to 4h I believe. reply lucideer 14 hours agorootparentprev> Bitwarden requires it every time.This is configurable - not sure what the default is but every time does sound annoying. reply barbazoo 14 hours agorootparentprevCan you compare to 1Password? reply jorvi 9 hours agorootparent1Password is very trustworthy too. They get audited frequently, and their db file format is open source (meaning you can write a 3rd party tool to decrypt them).With UI&#x2F;UX they are lightyears ahead of Bitwarden. I want to like Bitwarden, but when your application doesn’t even support extremely basic stuff like drag ‘n drop, I’m gone.In general they also support newer tech much faster. And their secret key system is more secure than Bitwarden’s password-only method. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparent> With UI&#x2F;UX they are lightyears ahead of Bitwarden.1Password is arguably moving backwards these days, UI-wise.I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s caused by the Electron update or just coincided with it, but I&#x27;ve been finding the keyboard autofill shortcut as well as keyboard navigation for selecting a given login on a page very unreliable lately.That said, 1Password&#x27;s \"auto-rotate password\" feature is still ahead of the competition, though. Bitwarden doesn&#x27;t even seem to try, but that&#x27;s still better than LastPass, which reliably used to lock me out by irrevocably overwriting the old stored password before the website confirms the new one as having been accepted.> their secret key system is more secure than Bitwarden’s password-only method.I don&#x27;t know, their security key mechanism seems to be getting weakened in the interest of convenience as well. I was recently very surprised to notice that the iOS client apparently synchronizes the security key for any logged-in vault to iCloud Keychain, with no way to opt out – even for enterprise vaults!Bitwarden will also soon support the WebAuthN&#x2F;CTAP2 \"PRF\" extension, which is even better than a static security key since it rotates with every vault unlock. reply ramenmeal 13 hours agorootparentprevsorry, no experience with 1password reply nedt 42 minutes agoparentprevFor hackers there is a CLI and with that also JS libs etc. to get it into anything you might want.

And the password generator is even worse than LP&#x27;s.Lastpass UI is well known to be poor - Bitwarden&#x27;s is far less worse by every metric.Bitwarden&#x27;s not perfect but what&#x27;s significantly better UI-wise? reply bmurphy1976 14 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t speak for the other password managers, but I find Bitwarden&#x27;s organization management to be pretty terrible.

In general, Webauthn doesn’t care where and how the keys are stored. There is attestation feature, but AFAIK e.g. Apple intentionally doesn’t implement it for unmanaged devices. reply lxgr 6 hours agorootparentNot sure about managed vs. unmanaged devices, but Apple used to support attestation before they started synchronizing passkeys via iCloud. reply jwally 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve experienced this on my phone IIRC...if I register a webauthn key on chrome on iphone, it shows up on safari; but the reverse is not true.Im assuming this is because apple uses a software based TPM that isn&#x27;t tied to the device. This lets those private keys sync between devices.Is the future state for bitwarden to be able to perform the same trick somehow? Have you create keys in it and not your devices tpm? reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentThe situation with Chrome and Apple devices is currently quite confusing.Apple has only recently introduced the necessary APIs to allow for third-party passkey providers (i.e. other apps acting as a passkey storage) and users (i.e. other apps using passkeys stored in iCloud and in other third-party provider apps).But it&#x27;s not easy as passkeys being supported on the latest versions; at least Google used to support a non-synchronizing platform authenticator implementation of WebAuthN using the system keychain and Touch ID (or the login password as a fallback) as well. So there is also a chance you were using that, at least on macOS.> Is the future state for bitwarden to be able to perform the same trick somehow?For web browsers, I believe the current approach of 1Password and presumably also Bitwarden is to inject a custom implementation of WebAuthN into every page&#x27;s context. This doesn&#x27;t require any WebAuthN&#x2F;passkey support on the browser&#x27;s side.On macOS, they could also act as a system-level passkey provider though; this should then allow all passkey consumers (such as Safari and other browsers) to use these passkeys natively, i.e. without a JavaScript shim. And on iOS, given how web extensions are notoriously tricky there and all browsers are kind of Safari under the hood anyway, that might even be the only option. reply CharlesW 5 hours agorootparent> The situation with Chrome and Apple devices is currently quite confusing.As someone who&#x27;s used 1Password, Apple&#x27;s password&#x2F;passkey manager, and Chrome&#x27;s password&#x2F;passkey manager while checking out the passkey user experience of these respective solutions, I didn&#x27;t find it more confusing than the ability to choose your preferred password manager.

Vaultwarden \"feels\" safe to me, but I would also be interested if there is some possibility it could introduce some degraded security compared to the official Bitwarden server.My Vaultwarden instance is \"hidden\" on a subdomain that probably nobody would ever guess (or scan for), so at least there is some added security by obscurity. If someone would know my credentials and master password, they probably won&#x27;t find where to use them. In this case the reverse proxy in front of it also serves other content, just be hitting the IP nobody would ever know there is a Vaultwarden running on this server.Edit: the subdomain is behind a wildcard DNS, so it&#x27;s also not listed in the zone file. Although it will show in DNS logs of the ISP when I&#x27;m using it. reply archi42 8 hours agorootparent1. If an attacker got your credentials, they&#x27;ll probably also have the server URL. Reasoning: They probably infected your machine with infostealer malware and keylogged the password. Or are you using the exact same credentials someplace else?2. If they can figure out your domain name, they can check crt.sh for \"mysecrectvaultwarden.domain.tld\". If that only reveals wildcard certs and they&#x27;re really interested in you or your company, they could try bruteforcing the DNS name.3. If they breach the vaultwarden server and in case you&#x27;re using the web UI, they can try to inject some JS to steal the credentials.What I do to mitigate this: 1. Vaultwarden only reachable via VPN (e.g. wireguard on OpnSense) 2. Custom CA on all devices (e.g. step-ca with name constraints and local ACME [careful to put DHCP clients on a subdomain!]) 3. DNS for my LAN+VPN is not public. This massively reduces the external attack surface, compared to having a bunch of services available behind traefik. reply neurostimulant 5 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK if you type something in the browser&#x27;s omnibar, the search provider such as google will receive the autocomplete query, so google will at least know your secret domain. If you&#x27;re using letsencrypt, your subdomain will show up in the public CT log, which is probably being mined by some data or security companies. Your dns providers will also know this secret subdomain as well and and some data companies might be able to obtain them. reply chrismorgan 2 hours agorootparentFirefox seems to be moderately conservative about what it does search autocompletion on. Type in the full URL, protocol and all, and it doesn’t look like it leaks anything after the colon.As for CT logs, this leak is avoided by using a wildcard certificate, which Let’s Encrypt supports. reply aborsy 12 hours agorootparentprevGood point actually, the passwords are encrypted with official Bitwarden client apps (unless using web app). reply BOOSTERHIDROGEN 11 hours agorootparentprevHow do you hide subdomain ? reply evulhotdog 7 hours agorootparentYou don’t, and they’re not really hiding anything from anybody who has any knowledge in the security space. reply figmert 14 hours agoparentprevVaultwarden is unaffiliated with Bitwarden.

    "originBody": "Sandor Dargo's Blog On C++, software development and books HOME CATEGORIES TAGS ARCHIVES BOOKS SPEAKING DAILY C++ HI...Blog 2023 11 01 C++23: Removing garbage collection support C++23: Removing garbage collection support Sandor Dargo 1 day ago 4 min If we go through the list of C++23 features, we can stumble upon the notion of garbage collection twice. Once among the language and once among the library features. Both entries refer to the same paper (P2186R2): garbage collection (GC in short) support is getting removed from C++. Just to make it clear, it’s not getting deprecated, but it’s getting completely removed. As it’s an unimplemented and unsupported feature, removing it is a nice act of language cleanup. It also wouldn’t be surprising if you never heard about GC in C++. The first surprise this paper might give you is the fact that it talks about Garbage Collection and C++. When I was learning about C++ in comparison with Java a long long time ago, one advantage of C++ was deterministic memory management due to the lack of garbage collection. As it turns out, in 2008 a minimal support for garbage collection and reachability-based leak detection was added to C++0x. This paper was based on two earlier ones, you’ll find the reference for those in the previously referenced one. Standard-conform garbage collectors should take into account strict pointer safety. In fact, there is no such garbage collectors in major standard libraries. N2670) introduced the std::pointer_safety enumeration with three enumerators: relaxed, preferred, strict. When std::get_pointer_safety() is called, an implementation will return a value indicating how it treats pointers that are not safely derived (see below). pointer_safety::relaxed is returned if non-safely-derived pointers will be treated the same as pointers that are safely derived for the duration of the program pointer_safety::preferred is returned if non-safely-derived pointers will be treated also the same as safely-derived pointers, but at the same time, the implementation is allowed to hint that it’s desirable to avoid dereferencing such pointers pointer_safety::strict is returned if non-safely-derived pointers might be treated differently than pointers that are safely derived. A pointer value is a safely-derived pointer to a dynamic object only if it has pointer-to-object type and it is: the value returned by a call to the C++ standard library implementation of ::operator new(std::size_t); the result of taking the address of a subobject of an lvalue resulting from dereferencing a safely-derived pointer value; the result of well-defined pointer arithmetic using a safely-derived pointer value; the result of a well-defined pointer conversion of a safely-derived pointer value; the result of a reinterpret_cast of a safely-derived pointer value; the result of a reinterpret_cast of an integer representation of a safely-derived pointer value; the value of an object whose value was copied from a traceable pointer object, where at the time of the copy the source object contained a copy of a safely-derived pointer value. The standard lets implementations get away with basically any, even no-op implementations of GC and therefore it makes very little sense to have them in the standard. This doesn’t mean though that there haven’t been any successful garbage collectors for C++. The most often use case for GC implemented in C++ is having virtual machines written in C++ for other languages that are garbage collected. Different JavaScript VMs are like that and Lua as well. But those garbage collectors also have their own set of requirements which are influenced much more by the language they help as their runtime than the C++ standard. While P2186R2 lists more concerns, I find it important to highlight two of them. When you read above about std::pointer_safety, did you understand the difference between relaxed and preferred? If you did, please explain in the comments section. It’s totally unclear what well-behaved programs should do when they are given this information. It only brings confusion with any benefits. The other problem is the definition of safely-derived pointers. In order to get a safely-derived pointer, you must use the global ::operator new and there are no other implementation-defined ways to get such pointers. This is a problem because people often want to use other news or want to avoid their usage completely to create objects in local arrays while avoiding heap usage. As a consequence, garbage collection has been removed from C++23 with a great majority as well as pointer safety. The following names are removed from std:: declare_reachable undeclare_reachable declare_no_pointers undeclare_no_pointers get_pointer_safety pointer_safety Conclusion Garbage collection and related features are being removed from C++23. If you are surprised to learn that the C++ standard had support for GC, you are not alone. It was unimplemented, confusing and pretty useless hence it’s removed. While there are existing garbage collectors, mostly for VMs written in C++ as a runtime for other languages, they are not impacted as they were not relying on the standard, exactly because of the reasons it’s getting removed. A bit of simplification to the standard never hurts.

My background is Biology so there were a few remarks about how \"a biologist just doesn&#x27;t know these things, lol\".This was around 2019, btw. And sure, I&#x27;m a biologist, but I also happen to have spent 8-10 hours&#x2F;week for the past 20 years coding because I just really like it; so, there&#x27;s my 10k hours, ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯. reply ComputerGuru 18 hours agoparentSo far as I can see, this was in the C++ spec but not implemented by any major compiler, though. So I guess the technical answer to “who’s right?” would depend on the verbiage of the discussion. :shrug:(But regardless, that sounds like a toxic environment and I’m glad you’re out of there. To think that because someone has a degree in biology, that automatically precludes them from knowing anything about computers or programming that you don’t is just the epitome of arrogance and hubris.) reply bjourne 16 hours agorootparentIf it came to that it&#x27;s time to whip out the technically right big dick and remind them that C++ has had smart pointers since forever and that TRACING garbage collection is far from the only automatic garbage collection technique known to man. ;) reply astrange 12 hours agorootparentC++ has had conservative tracing garbage collection since forever; GCC is garbage collected and you can use Boehm gc. reply influx 14 hours agorootparentprevSome of the best programmers I&#x27;ve worked with have backgrounds in sciences, and it&#x27;s been a delight just being around them as they apply some of that knowledge in in a different field. reply slaymaker1907 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m kind of surprised they didn&#x27;t try to get rid of&#x2F;adapt the standard for C++&#x2F;CLI on Windows since it actually uses GC for a lot of things. However, I guess the standard wasn&#x27;t all that useful, especially since it mandated a lot of overhead for pointer arithmetic. My theory is that it is very difficult to come up with a general API for interacting with GC&#x27;d memory in C++ because making the API efficient depends heavily on how it is implemented. reply pjmlp 33 minutes agorootparentYeah that is the thing, Unreal C++, C++&#x2F;CLI, and COM&#x2F;WinRT frameworks, are the main users of automatic memory management in C++ dialects, and none of them was taken into consideration. reply harry8 11 hours agoparentprevThat kind of blatant ass-holery is really common in C++ circles and you even see Bjarne doing it.\"I understand what you are trying to say and I think you are wrong\" at a conf to delighted razzes and jeers from the room. Bjarne had seemingly just discovered that link lists thrash cache and was presenting about swapping in a vector instead. Note it&#x27;s got nothing to do with whether this guy is onto something or not. It is possible to disagree without being an asshole. Bjarne missed the opportunity. C++ culture follows.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SfkMiGFVhZo?si=pd36kbm9FFoKFuKm&t=4111IMHO it is unsurprising there&#x27;s a lot of groupthink involved in such a culture and it has really damaged the language and certainly makes it unpleasant in the way you describe. reply angiosperm 5 hours agorootparentBjarne is right, the guy is wrong, full stop. If you don&#x27;t care about performance, then don&#x27;t worry about performance. Use std::list if you like, and don&#x27;t complain about it.Ultimately, we write programs to make machines do things. What we write exactly determines what the machine does. It is our responsibility to understand what we write makes the machine do; otherwise it won&#x27;t do what we wanted. Often (maybe almost always nowadays) the performance details don&#x27;t matter much. When they do matter, there is no substitute for understanding.The Standard data structures are constructed simply, with understandable performance characteristics, imposing minimal overhead both in time and code space. This is an extremely important quality not to sacrifice idly. No one is obliged to use only the Standard containers; if you need something different, you can write something different yourself, or even find it online somewhere. You are encouraged to write something yourself, and maybe publish it. People do.In a very real sense, the Standard containers are just examples. Making them unnecessarily complicated would make them worse examples, and would make them worse for almost all places they are used. reply harry8 4 hours agorootparentI think you may have missed the point of my raising that fwiw. I genuinely don&#x27;t care who is right [1]. Bjarne&#x27;s attitude and manner is very wrong and very normal amongst c++ people. That&#x27;s a shame. He could have explained his point of view forcefully, without being a jerk. Bjarne made his choice.Maybe it&#x27;s why there have been so many terrible decisions in C++ over the years because being an asshole and right might scare off discussion but it doesn&#x27;t make even Bjarne infallible.[1] If you care about performance you take full responsibility for all code used including all libraries like the stl, which might well mean you don&#x27;t use the stl and vector and write something optimised for your specific purpose, and not for every possible purpose. But I don&#x27;t want to be an ass about saying it. reply lenkite 41 minutes agorootparentFor someone for whom English is a second language, what was wrong with his statement ?

And yes, it&#x27;s getting a few upvotes, weird thing to be mad at that but to each its own. reply Kranar 15 hours agorootparentWe should be clear, GC was never a feature in C++.What these features do, which are being removed, is make it easier to implement a GC allocator in a standard conforming and portable fashion. Current GCs in C++, such as Boehm&#x27;s GC, depend on platform specific hacks that are incredibly brittle.As it turns out, these features do not make it easier to actually implement a GC allocator in C++, so they are being removed.I think most people can differentiate between a language providing a feature as a first class native property, and a library or feature built on top of that language. Most people would not argue against the position that C++ does not contain a web browser as a feature, even though it&#x27;s possible to build a web browser using C++.Similarly, C++ does not and has never had garbage collection, but for a time the standard did provide facilities that was supposed to make it easier to implement a garbage collection library. reply skitter 17 hours agorootparentprevIt was in the spec but never implemented, so it&#x27;s obly a feature of C++ if you take the stance that there are no real implementations of C++. reply TeMPOraL 17 hours agorootparentIf you want to go this way, then take a look at compiler support matrix for last few language versions - if having an implementation is necessary for something in spec to \"be a feature of C++\", then C++20 and C++23 are still missing some features they&#x27;re supposed to have. reply moralestapia 17 hours agorootparentprevIIRC it was present in Clang back at the time (which was relevant to us as we were using it); not sure about gcc or others. reply pjmlp 16 hours agorootparentprevSeveral features in ISO are yet to be fully implemented, there are compilers still catching up with C++17.GC isn&#x27;t the first one to victim of such lack of implementations, only EDG implemented C++98 external templates, for example. reply pbsd 15 hours agorootparentextern templates are a C++11 feature. export templates are the removed C++98 feature. reply pjmlp 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the correction, I meant obviously export templates. replyziddoap 10 hours agorootparentprev>I guess this is what other people come to HN (now) to read in the comments.Reading comments (loosely-related, tangential, meta, whatever) that generate potentially interesting discussion?

In a language where races are UB all bets are off and that&#x27;s a pretty wild consequence for what may be a relatively minor mistake.Because data races aren&#x27;t UB in Java, our program even though its behaviour now likely defies ordinary understanding by its creators, does still have some coherent behaviour. For example maybe we raced code that&#x27;s putting CustomerOrders in a List, and so the List is smashed. In a language like C++ it&#x27;s entirely possible that the smashed List is so toxic that even asking how big it is potentially has completely insane answers, crashes, runs arbitrary code, anything might happen - let alone if trying to take all the CustomerOrders out one at a time for processing. In Java, maybe the List is empty, which is not what we wanted, or it has all the orders which shouldn&#x27;t be there, it won&#x27;t have for example a negative number of CustomerOrders or anything else completely nonsensical.In terms of defensible business logic, Java&#x27;s memory model isn&#x27;t better. But in terms of \"Do attackers who exploited my race also get to run arbitrary machine code with database access?\" the answer is definitely going to be \"No\" in Java for a data race, unlike in C++ or even Go.Also, while it&#x27;s true that Undefined Behaviour is common for data races (because of SC&#x2F;DRF and laziness), it&#x27;s not what happens in OCaml, they&#x27;ve come up with an even cleverer scheme than Java so that they hope their programs remain not only strictly well defined, but maybe something you can reason about despite a data race. reply cogman10 18 hours agorootparentprevYes... but I think the real question that will stump people is \"What isand how is it different from \". :DJava generic semantics are wild and often surprising.But too your point, I think typescript is FAR more complex than C++ yet I almost never see similar complaints of its complexity. The richer the type system, the more complex the language. reply jcranmer 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not the real confusing one in generics. The real confusing one is \"What is the difference between Class and Class>\" (i.e., mixed generics and raw types)... I only know about this because it bit me in the ass once! reply cogman10 18 hours agorootparentHa! I thought about doing a tricky thing with wildcards vs missing generics.What gets even more wild is, for reasons I really don&#x27;t understand, when a missing generic makes its way into a generic pipeline it seems to have the tendency to erase other generics. (IE, `list.stream().map((f)->new Map())` does weird things with the stream as it gets more complex.). You can throw in \"What&#x27;s the difference between List, List, List, and List\" for good measure :D reply tsimionescu 16 hours agorootparentprevThese are both pretty intuitive - you can provide any class which is extended by or extends T respectively. Some of the consequences are less intuitive, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any hard to remember. As someone who last professionally programmed Java during Java 7 days, it was still clear to me what these mean. reply charcircuit 18 hours agorootparentprev>I think the real question that will stump people is \"What isand how is it different from \"No, I don&#x27;t think so.

The things you can and hopefully do keep in your head are what addressing modes exist, how flags affect things, how interrupts work etc&#x27;.Better low level developers than me also understand all the concurrency stuff - what is kept in which cache when, what operations constitute which kinds of memory barriers and what guarantees do you get about the thing you just read or wrote. reply t-3 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s actually not that bad.

You are the person on the team who knows the ins and outs of the language and is proud of it. You are a valuable member of the team, but I don’t want a whole team of you. There are other skills that are just as important in getting something “delivered” as knowing all the syntax. reply wrs 18 hours agorootparentJudgment? Like assuming that if someone understands the language they’re using they must not have other skills? :) reply LastTrain 18 hours agorootparentI said there are other skills that are just as valuable that I look for when building a team. Exhaustive knowledge of a language is a perfect skill for writing docs, training, performing interviews & doing code reviews. My main point was, it is not a required skill to be a “good” developer, like you seemed to imply. reply SonOfLilit 9 hours agorootparentI said it&#x27;s possible to keep a full model of how some languages work in my head and I find it helpful to, not that it&#x27;s mandatory. I even said that I can&#x27;t do it in C++ and that I&#x27;ve delivered C++ projects, so I don&#x27;t think my phrasing implied that it&#x27;s required :-)A good developer ships high quality software. If the situation calls for it, she ships it in C++ or ECMAScript 3 or Microsoft InfoPath. Nothing else is required. Many other skills are very useful, like good communication skills or some understanding of business or math or how computer infrastructure works.These days I seldom write code - maybe one out of 4 or 5 work days I&#x27;ll spend more than half an hour typing code in a text editor - and yet having a good model in my head of how my language works, how my database works, how my caches work, how my network works, is something that&#x27;s very useful to me everyday. Other talented developers I know don&#x27;t have that, and I recommend most of them to spend a bit of time acquiring it because it&#x27;s worth it. More talented developers than me that I know and work full time in C++ don&#x27;t have it, and sadly I don&#x27;t recommend they get it because I think it&#x27;s beyond their abilities. I think that&#x27;s a negative attribute of a language that has some other very positive attributes (like its culture of just writing code that solves problems instead of obsessing about tools and DX all day). replyskywal_l 19 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with this is what you don&#x27;t know can hurt you, that&#x27;s why I like Sean Baxter initiative[0], where you can selectively disable c++ features (at file level!).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circle-lang.org&#x2F; reply CoastalCoder 17 hours agorootparentI was about to say the same thing. With C++, you don&#x27;t necessarily know if you&#x27;re looking at code that uses unfamiliar language rules, especially when templates are involved. reply kstrauser 18 hours agorootparentprevI think I have about 95% of Python in my head. I occasionally see a new edge case I hadn’t considered, but it’s been a while. The language itself is rather compact. There aren’t so very many keywords or builtin functions. Even the stdlib is manageable, although I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised when a module has added some new functionality or convenience that will save me time. It’s knowable. reply pjmlp 17 hours agorootparentThe almost 3000 pages of language reference, standard library and C extension API, and changes across language versions? reply kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentYeah, because there&#x27;s a whole lot of redundancy. If you \"know\" 3.11, and upgrade to 3.12, there are only going to be a few changelog items you&#x27;ll actually care about. The rest are generally internal implementation changes that don&#x27;t affect how you use the language.OK, so I don&#x27;t have every corner of the stdlib memorized, especially the odd deprecated batteries-included stuff like playing sounds on a Sun workstation. Nor do I have the extension API docs committed to memory, as you can use the language a lot without having to write those things yourself.But the core of Python, like the language itself and the most common parts of the stdlib that are actually used in 95% of Python code, I have a strong grip on. In particular, the actual language is pretty simple. reply hota_mazi 18 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with Python (and dynamically typed languages in general) is not so much knowing the language, but understanding the code that people write with it.Since there are no type annotations to help your understanding of the code, you need to keep a lot in your head, as opposed to statically typed languages. reply kstrauser 18 hours agorootparentThat’s not been my experience at all, but I could see it being confusing at first.Also, we do have type annotations now. They’re not universally used, and definitely not required, but mypy and friends can go a long way toward finding type issues even without them. reply abound 18 hours agorootparentprevOther people have touched on this, but I think one&#x27;s ability to be productive in a language is highly correlated with how much of the language (and project domain) they can \"keep in their head\" at a time.This is why Go is my (and seemingly a lot of other people&#x27;s) go-to \"get shit done\" language, I can write and edit code for hours without having to think about (too many) footguns or hunt for docs and esoterica. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentBut when you hit the edge of your language, it will be a very painful experience, with disgusting, unmaintainable workarounds.Mind you, I’m not thinking of some obscure thing that is only possible in Lisps, as in my experience these are seldom required, and code generation is always an option.Go is hilariously ill-designed from this perspective, it gives you the common 80%, but has no answers for the remaining 20%. Generics does improve it a bit, but there are so many edge cases that it is simply sad to see it in a supposedly modern language. reply adrianN 18 hours agorootparentprevI can write and edit C++ for hours without thinking too much too, and I’m no language lawyer.

But not as an end game; “you’ll never get it, don’t even try!” tThe idea that you as a team might develop a large piece of software, but have an unknown feel for how much more there is that is unknown, is scary to me.And a bit ironic. I lived through the static compile type&#x2F;dynamic late type wars. There was this argument that with C++ (and similar) you knew and had some compiler ratified certitude you could count on. But if you’re telling me that a junior&#x2F;intermediate dev can write code, perhaps making head scratching design concessions to get the thing to compile, he might make code that appears to run in the common case, but has unexpected behavior in other as of yet demonstrated areas, because they can never hope to have enough knowledge of the language to build a semi accurate model to know what to expect, then we’re really no better off than those late bound interpreted hippies with their weird metaprogramming VMs. reply Night_Thastus 18 hours agorootparentWhoah, I think you completely mis-read my intention.My point is that C++ offers users a lot of tools. You don&#x27;t need to use most of them to solve most problems. Just start with simple tools: functions, classes, standard templates, etc.That 10% effort will solve 90% of problems.If you find a problem that can&#x27;t be solved with the simple tools, then start looking into more advanced features C++ offers and use them if appropriate.That is why no-one needs (or should try) to keep all of C++ in their head. It&#x27;s not necessary for most problem solving.It&#x27;s of course fine to be enthusiastic about it and learn some new things just for the sake of learning.

C++03 written without modern tooling and a hardass style guide and stuff is usually a nightmare. I would vastly prefer to work in almost any Rust codebase compared to a sprawling nightmare of code that still calls new&#x2F;delete routinely.A modern C++ codebase with all the best practices and tools and stuff? 6 one way half dozen the other more or less: Rust is now fast and feature full enough to be an option for most anything C++ would do. Do you like hardcore affine typing by default or dislike it?Another way to think about it is that modulo some big differences: Rust bundles (and mandates) a bunch of stuff you opt into in C++: a uniform set of best practices, hardcore static analysis, a credible strategy for catching memory safety issues and UB and thread safety issues. (The case is overstated about the difference in efficacy of e.g. ASAN and the borrow checker, they have pros and cons and it’s not a 1-bit debate).C++ tooling has a few important edges (though Rust is catching up): clangd is usually (always?) faster and more stable than rust-analyzer but you can throw hardware at it so it’s not a huge deal.Cargo is just a dunk below some project size. Above some project size the story is still evolving.It’s just not as big of a difference as you often hear one way or the other. I’d probably default to Rust unless I had library interop reasons to go C++ (which is often). reply dthul 19 hours agoparentprevI work with both, having started with C++ about 17 years ago, and agree that Rust feels like a relatively simple language compared to C++. Rust might feel harder to learn initially because the borrow checker won&#x27;t let you compile certain programs, but once you are over this initial hump, the rest is quite straightforward. reply fluoridation 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t really agree with that. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re complex in different directions. C++ has complexities Rust doesn&#x27;t because it bends over backwards for source-level compatibility. A lot of it is entirely at the semantic and pragmatic level. Rust&#x27;s complexities are mostly due to its type system, meaning the complexity is at the syntactic level.

You&#x27;re lucky if it can get the right type hints and jump to definition. And even the latter may not be complete.Contrast with e.g. Java, which makes it easy for the IDEs to get the full picture. reply fluoridation 16 hours agorootparentSure, but in those cases the parser just gives up. It doesn&#x27;t grow its working set trying harder and harder seemingly forever.We&#x27;re talking about C++ and Rust here, so I don&#x27;t know why you bring up Java. If parsing Rust was as easy as parsing Java you would not see me complaining about it. reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparentGiving up vs. crashing is a trivial difference, ultimately boiling down to an extra terminating condition connected to real-world resource use. Either way, the parsing is useless.I brought up Java as an example of what it means for the IDE parsing to work and be useful. reply fluoridation 15 hours agorootparentLosing your work versus a minor inconvenience is a trivial difference to you? Well, okay! reply TeMPOraL 14 hours agorootparentWhat kind of IDE are you working in that will lose your work when it crashes?I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in the Rust world, but in C++ world, even the good ol&#x27; Visual C++ (2017, 2019), when it crashes (which it does surprisingly often on my work&#x27;s codebase), it doesn&#x27;t lose anything other than maybe unsaved edits. It&#x27;s annoying, sure, but 30 seconds later it&#x27;s back to where it was before the crash.Also, a not working parser is not a trivial inconvenience. It just means the tool doesn&#x27;t work. From the POV of wanting to use advanced functionality that relies on parsing the code, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the tool aborts its execution so it doesn&#x27;t crash, or has to be disabled because it doesn&#x27;t abort its execution and just crashes. The end result is the same: I can&#x27;t use the advanced functionality. reply fluoridation 13 hours agorootparentWhat I said was that the computer crashed.

Now compare \"the IDE is just working as a glorified text editor\" to what I&#x27;m describing above. reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sorry for misunderstanding your earlier comment, and thank you for clarifying. I can see how this is a much more serious problem.However.That sounds to me less like an IDE problem, and more like a Linux problem. Specifically, the problem with the... unique way a typical Linux system handles OOM state, i.e. by suddenly curling into a ball and becoming completely unresponsive until you power-cycle it. I&#x27;ve hit that a couple times in the past, and my solutions were, in order:- Monitoring the memory usage and killing the offending process (a graph database runtime) before it OOMs the system;- After becoming tired of the constant vigilance, quadrupling the amount of RAM available in the OS; (yes, this is why people overprovision their machines relative to what naive economists or operations people may think..)- Changing the job, and switching to working on Windows; WSL may not be 100% like a real Linux, but it inherits sane OOM handling from its host platform.I&#x27;m sure there is a way in Linux to set a memory quota for the offending IDE process. This would hopefully reduce your problem to the more benign (if annoying) case I described earlier. reply fluoridation 11 hours agorootparentI actually run Windows mainly. This was inside a Hyper-V VM with 32 GiB of RAM. I&#x27;d like to be able to work on this project from Windows, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t, and don&#x27;t have the energy or inclination to figure out how to get it building on Windows. I already knew rust-analyze had this problem, which is partly why I allocated so much memory for the VM. Unfortunately I triggered a rust-analyze rebuild just as I was already building another codebase in a different directory. That&#x27;s what brought it over the edge.While I agree that Linux sucks at handling this particular situation, my point was about Rust&#x27;s complexity. Normally, when you&#x27;re using C&#x2F;++ dependencies the IDE doesn&#x27;t need to inspect the internals of the libraries to figure out how to parse dependent code. And, it&#x27;s also true that rust-analyze doesn&#x27;t know how to stop trying. It will parse what you give it, even if it kills your machine. replygpderetta 17 hours agorootparentprevI had emacs crash (well, lock-up) while trying to parse the error messages from some extreme C++ metaprogramming.

Just wait how large the Rust surface area might have become in 2053. There’s lessons to be learned from history, so hopefully less, but about every successful language so far has only kept growing and becoming more complex. reply ReactiveJelly 19 hours agorootparentIndeed it&#x27;s already grown `async` and `?` since 1.0. But I love those features, they&#x27;re a good thing.In Rust, the compiler still checks everything. I can&#x27;t mis-use async or the question mark operator and accidentally make my code unsafe.In C++, I&#x27;m expected to know everything about every feature I use, so I have to be paranoid. Sure I remember that unique_ptr isn&#x27;t atomic, do my juniors remember that? Sure, returning a reference to a local variable is a warning, but it&#x27;s not an error, right? Many less-healthy teams probably ignore those warnings. And I myself don&#x27;t even remember the rules for SFINAE or `move` in full. Not to mention that OpenCV&#x27;s mix of shallow and deep copying for matrices casually breaks `const`.In Rust, more surface area is just more Lego bricks. If two Legos snap together, you&#x27;re safe. If they don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t force them. C++ expects you to force everything and take responsibility for not being a human encyclopedia of the language. reply no_wizard 19 hours agorootparentIs it not possible to use a linter with C++ that can tell you when you have done X or Y incorrectly?surely, there is tooling that can help right? reply UncleMeat 18 hours agorootparentOften no, for multiple reasons.Separate compilation means that even if you write an interprocedural static analysis system (quite a bit more complex than what most people would call a linter), you still run into oodles of hard boundaries where you can&#x27;t look into other functions. Fixing this requires explicit annotations all over the place to even have a chance.C++ is also a remarkably complex language in terms of aliasing relationships. There are a bazillion ways you can make two names alias each other. This gives you a few options when writing an analysis. You can be sound and do weak updates everywhere, which means your alarms will basically never be confident. You can be unsound and assume no aliasing, which means that you&#x27;ve got a lot of false alarms. You also can&#x27;t really make a rule \"don&#x27;t ever create aliasing relationships\" because they are often idiomatic C++.And finally, the key properties that people really deeply care about like heap lifetimes fundamentally involve complex reasoning about both temporal properties, dataflow, and heap shape. All of these are hairy static analysis problems.

But the total quantity can become a bad thing, because the interactions between the features become more and more complicated. It&#x27;s almost like features have values proportional to the number of features, but they have costs proportional to the square of the number of features. You eventually reach the point where new features add more cost than they add value.But it&#x27;s not that simple, because each new feature adds value to a subset, but adds costs to everyone. If the subset is vocal, they often get what they want, even if it&#x27;s a net loss for all users taken as a whole.So the trick is, first, to stop adding features once the costs outweigh the benefits, and second, given that you have only a finite number of features that you can add before you reach that point, to add the total set of features that are going to make the most valuable language. reply protomolecule 18 hours agorootparentprev\"Sure, returning a reference to a local variable is a warning, but it&#x27;s not an error, right?

One can hope that Rust evolves very slowly and as-needed. IMHO part of the problem with C++ is the fact that a committee exists to advance the language and produce regular updates. Combine that with most of the language already being defined (with a lot of overlap with C BTW) and you get a lot of bolted-on stuff and core features as part of the standard library that might have otherwise been part of the language with nice syntax. Rust had the advantage that a lot of things had been learned prior to its creation so things are cleaner. Lets hope keeping it that way is a priority and not just adding new things on top of new things - I think they&#x27;re doing it right, but I don&#x27;t really follow it.C is great in this regard. The language is IMHO mostly \"done\" and rarely changes. I&#x27;m happy to use C99 and not much demands newer.Looking at Wikipedia I&#x27;m afraid C is starting to get too many updates, but the 2017 version is said to add no new features! :-) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C_(programming_language) reply marcosdumay 19 hours agorootparentprevWell though-out languages gain complexity in a much slower rate than the carelessly put together ones.

So in 30 years most systems programming will be done in a language that doesn&#x27;t exist yet?

C++ usage is still growing by leaps and bounds.

That will be true for a long time.Rust could still catch on. replyamalcon 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve worked a lot with C++, and a small to moderate amount with Rust. I tend to prefer Rust when given the choice.Comparing the overall complexity levels is something of a category error, though. Most of the complexity of Rust is in the core functionality, idioms, and conventions of the language. You&#x27;ll need to grapple with most of that complexity very early.Most of the complexity of C++ is in the various functionality that was either inherited from C or accumulated over the decades after that. Most individual pieces of software don&#x27;t use all of that. E.g. approximately nothing will use both va_list and variadic templates (ok, maybe indirectly through libraries, but not in a way the direct author needs to think about). The latter is just a better way of accomplishing what the former does. There are lots of variations on this theme.My sense is that, in practice, Rust has a steeper learning curve than C++. I find it more productive now that I&#x27;m pretty familiar with it, so I think it&#x27;s worth that steeper learning curve. I still think it&#x27;s a bit steeper. reply pavon 19 hours agoparentprevThis might be influenced by the fact that I&#x27;ve used C&#x2F;C++ for much longer, but my impression is that Rust is an even larger language with more details to learn than C++. The difference is that in Rust if you get the details wrong (in safe code) you get a compiler error or at worst a logic bug, while in C++ sometimes you get a compiler error and sometimes you get memory corruption or integer overflows, or undefined behavior.Expanding on this, the general concepts you need to understand for both are about the same, but because Rust enforces them in the compiler, you have to learn the detailed rules of how the language enforces ownership and lifetimes and such which is more detailed&#x2F;complicated&#x2F;restrictive than the concepts themselves.Furthermore, some of the Rust language details cause library APIs to become more involved than they would be in C++. An example in the std library is that in C++ handling errors and function results are orthogonal features. With sum types they are intertwined, and the Rust community is more liberal with adding convenience functions and syntax so you end up with a combinatorial explosion of all the different ways you want to handle the error combined with all the ways you want to handle the result, with about 40 methods each in Result and Option, plus methods for handling errors in iterators (functional streams). Lifetimes and async can also complicate crate APIs in ways that don&#x27;t exist in C++. None of them are difficult on their own, but the shear volume of things you need to learn an remember makes me appreciate the minimal Go philosophy.On the flip side, the places where C++ gets more complex are all the little bad decisions that can&#x27;t be fixed for backwards compatibility like the stupid numeric conversion rules inherited from C which can easily bite you. And both the C and C++ string&#x2F;stream libraries suck in their own ways. reply trealira 18 hours agorootparent> This might be influenced by the fact that I&#x27;ve used C&#x2F;C++ for much longer, but my impression is that Rust is an even larger language with more details to learn than C++.

Rust seems less complicated in many ways. For example, move semantics are a lot simpler; they&#x27;re always a byte copy, whereas with C++, you have to remember rvalue references, lvalue references, and universal&#x2F;forwarding references (which are usually rvalue references but sometimes are lvalue references). You also have to be careful not to mess with a moved-from object, as it&#x27;s in an unspecified state.C++ also makes a distinction between trivially copyable types and non-trivially copyable types (a distinction Rust doesn&#x27;t make). It&#x27;s difficult to remember the rules for non-trivially copyable classes, but they boil down to \"if it has a user-provided constructor, destructor, or copy-assignment operator; or if it has virtual functions; then it&#x27;s not trivially copyable.\"In Rust, all you have to remember is that types are by default moveable (and moves are a memcpy), deep copies are implemented through the Clone trait, and if your type can&#x27;t be memcpy&#x27;d (e.g., a self-referential struct) it needs to only be accessible through Pin pointers, which ensure that it isn&#x27;t memcpy&#x27;d in safe code.Another thing: you can cause a use-after-free error by combining coroutines with lambdas [1]. An error like this only happens because C++&#x27;s rules around coroutines and lambdas are complicated enough that the committee didn&#x27;t forsee this happening. This seems indicative of higher complexity in C++ than Rust, to me.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=95111#c23 reply pavon 16 hours agorootparentOn the other-hand, I find it annoying in Rust that an assignment or an unadorned function parameter might result in a move or a copy and you can&#x27;t tell by the function signature or call site. Instead it depends on whether the type implements the Copy trait, which is a big semantic difference based on \"spooky action at a distance\".> You also have to be careful not to mess with a moved-from object, as it&#x27;s in an unspecified state.This is a great example of Rust being easier, even when it just as complex. Both languages don&#x27;t allow you to use an object after it is moved, so it is the same amount to learn and to think about when writing code, but Rust will give you a helpful compile-time error while C++ will let you blow your foot off. reply kaba0 1 hour agorootparent> but Rust will give you a helpful compile-time error while C++ will let you blow your foot off.But Rust can actually analyze trivially when this happens, while it is not possible with C++ due to language semantics. reply fluoridation 16 hours agorootparentprev>You also have to be careful not to mess with a moved-from object, as it&#x27;s in an unspecified state.This is incorrect, somewhat. It&#x27;s \"unspecified\" in the sense that the standard doesn&#x27;t mandate that user-defined move constructors and assignment operators leave source objects in any particular state. All standard library classes are left in well-defined states when moved (if they can be moved), and you can choose to define your classes to do the same. The usual rule of thumb is that a moved object should be in the same state as if it had just been default-constructed. This is what all the standard classes do.Move semantics in C++ and in Rust are more or less equivalent. The major differences are that C++ copies by default and rust moves by default, and that Rust doesn&#x27;t allow using a moved object while C++ does.>In Rust, all you have to remember is that types are by default moveable (and moves are a memcpy), deep copies are implemented through the Clone trait, and if your type can&#x27;t be memcpy&#x27;d (e.g., a self-referential struct) it needs to only be accessible through Pin pointers, which ensure that it isn&#x27;t memcpy&#x27;d in safe code.If defining value semantics was so simple you wouldn&#x27;t have had to bring up Pin pointers (which I assume are not just pointers, but something special that needs to be kept in mind), or the fact that Rust understands that there are two different kinds of code, which C++ doesn&#x27;t distinguish. It&#x27;s suddenly so obvious that one is simpler than the other.>Another thing: you can cause a use-after-free error by combining coroutines with lambdas [1]. An error like this only happens because C++&#x27;s rules around coroutines and lambdas are complicated enough that the committee didn&#x27;t forsee this happening. This seems indicative of higher complexity in C++ than Rust, to me.It&#x27;s trivially easy to cause use-after-free errors with lambdas. Return an std::function that captures and reads a local std::unique_ptr by reference and then call operator()() on the object. This is not a complex interplay between features; lambdas necessarily introduce dynamic lifetimes into a language that was originally not designed to support them, so using them requires care. reply senderista 14 hours agorootparent> Move semantics in C++ and in Rust are more or less equivalent.That&#x27;s not my experience at all. The big annoyance for me with C++ move semantics is that it forces me to allow an invalid or default state (representing a moved-from object), which subverts a major premise of RAII: non-default constructors establish class invariants which are maintained for the lifetime of the object, so that all other code can assume those invariants. There should be no such thing as an invalid or partially initialized object. When I&#x27;m forced to allow an invalid state to support move semantics, all my code has to either check for this invalid state (if it&#x27;s logically possible) or assert that it&#x27;s not present (if it&#x27;s not logically possible). That&#x27;s a major source of gratuitous complexity that simply isn&#x27;t inherent to move semantics, as Rust demonstrates. (The invalid state is necessary because there&#x27;s no way to prevent destructors from running in C++, so a destructor needs some way to know that an object isn&#x27;t properly initialized.)C++ move semantics have brought us back to the bad old days of checking isInitialized flags and calling initialize() methods, which is what non-default constructors were supposed to solve. reply fluoridation 13 hours agorootparentIf you find yourself doing if (!initialized) initialize(); that&#x27;s a sign that you should have just called initialize() on the moved object while still inside the move constructor, if initialize doesn&#x27;t need any additional parameters. If there&#x27;s no way to construct or initialize the class in a default state (e.g. something equivalent to an empty std::string) with no additional parameters, it&#x27;s probable that the class shouldn&#x27;t have been movable, and instead the object should have been wrapped either in std::unique_ptr or std::optional. Not every class needs to be movable.Again, this has nothing to do with C++&#x27;s move semantics and everything to do with how you define your object&#x27;s state transformations. reply senderista 12 hours agorootparentLet me make it a bit more concrete. I have a hazard pointer class, where the constructor registers the provided pointer for GC protection, and the destructor removes GC protection. I would like to be able to dereference this hazard pointer object freely, without doing null checks everywhere. RAII is the perfect fit for these semantics: the constructor establishes the invariant (GC-protected non-null pointer) and all other code can assume the invariant. Until I needed move semantics, that is.In the constructor of a class with a hazard pointer member I needed to be able to initialize a hazard pointer on the stack and then move it into the member variable. (Because the hazard pointer constructor is fallible, I needed to catch exceptions thrown from the hazard pointer&#x27;s constructor and retry from within the containing class&#x27;s constructor, so I couldn&#x27;t just use an initializer list.) In order to support move semantics, I had to give up the invariant that any hazard pointer instance is properly initialized (I needed to use a null pointer to represent the invalid state). That complicated all the clients, which now had to either check for or assert against the invalid state.None of these gymnastics would have been necessary in Rust. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have constructors, but it&#x27;s easy enough to write a factory method that establishes constructor invariants, and then you know that any object returned from that factory method will satisfy those invariants for the entire lifetime of the object. Since it is impossible to accidentally use a moved-from object (unlike C++), there is no need to introduce an invalid state to prevent misuse. I could just freely dereference my hazard pointers, with no checks or asserts necessary. reply senderista 12 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s a much simpler example of something impossible in C++ and trivial in Rust: how about a non-nullable unique_ptr? The constructor should just be able to check for null and then no code need ever check for null again, right? Sorry, you need an invalid state to represent a moved-from instance, so this is impossible.Are you telling me that having to accommodate invalid states that are semantically both unnecessary and undesirable is not a serious limitation of C++ move semantics? reply fluoridation 12 hours agorootparentFollowing the previous example, you wrap std::unique_ptr in another class that has no move constructor and forwards constructor parameters to std::make_unique(), and can also be constructed from an std::unique_ptr. Now you have a heap-allocated smart pointer class that can&#x27;t possibly be null.Alternatively, you make it movable, and if someone tries to call operator*(), operator->(), or get() on the null value, you throw an exception. Not as clean, but, hey, it&#x27;s safe. reply fluoridation 12 hours agorootparentprevIt seems like the obvious answer is to have a nullable_hazard_ptr and a hazard_ptr, which composites nullable_hazard_ptr. nullable_hazard_ptr is movable and default-constructible, while hazard_ptr can only be constructed with arguments and cannot be moved, but can be constructed from a nullable_hazard_ptr &&.So if you need to return a hazard pointer from a function you return a nullable_hazard_ptr and the caller can choose to assigned that value to auto or to hazard_ptr. In the latter case, the caller will have the guarantee that the object is valid because if the function returned a null pointer the constructor will have thrown an exception. Furthermore the pointer will remain valid until it goes out of scope because there&#x27;s nothing that can be done to it to make it invalid (UB notwithstanding). Of course, anyone who chooses to use nullable_hazard_ptr will need to check for validity.Unfortunately this does mean that it&#x27;s the responsibility of the callers to choose the right pointer.>In the constructor of a class with a hazard pointer member I needed to be able to initialize a hazard pointer on the stack and then move it into the member variable. (Because the hazard pointer constructor is fallible, I needed to catch exceptions thrown from the hazard pointer&#x27;s constructor and retry from within the containing class&#x27;s constructor, so I couldn&#x27;t just use an initializer list.)This particular case would be handled by calling a helper function in the constructor&#x27;s initialization list for each hazard_ptr member. As I said, this function should return nullable_hazard_ptr (always non-null; you will have already ensured this inside the function. You still need the nullable type because it&#x27;s the only one that can be moved).Ultimately what you have is something analogous to std::lock_guard and std::unique_lock. You are acquiring and releasing a resource and in some cases you need to tie the acquisition into the program structure and in other cases you need to be able untie it. There&#x27;s no way to specify that in C++&#x27;s type system other than by having two separate types. reply trealira 14 hours agorootparentprev>If defining value semantics was so simple you wouldn&#x27;t have had to bring up Pin pointers (which I assume are not just pointers, but something special that needs to be kept in mind) [...]Pin is basically a wrapper for any pointer type P, whether it&#x27;s Box, &mut T, &T, etc. Its sole purpose is to keep the object that&#x27;s pointed at from being moved, byte-copied, or byte-swapped.

I just think this is more complex than Rust&#x27;s unconditional rule that moves are bytewise copies, and moved-from objects aren&#x27;t allowed to be used.

At the point of use, moving is no different from any other operation on the object. There&#x27;s no intrinsic difference between moving an std::unique_ptr and reset()ing it. You do have to keep in mind the possible values of the object as you operate on it, but this has nothing to do with move semantics. In any language, you wouldn&#x27;t want to attempt to access the 10th element of a list after clearing the list.Now, if you design your class such that the moved-from state is invalid and distinct from any state the the object could reach by any other means then yes, you will need to treat moves on that type differently. However, that&#x27;s a problem you created for yourself.>The reason is because coroutines copy their input to their own stack frames, but lambdas are passed by address, and so the coroutine later dereferences a dangling pointer.Yes, like I said, lambdas decouple lifetime from lexical scope. You have to be use them carefully to avoid running into issues. This is not because C++ lambdas are a complex feature than Rust lambdas. The opposite is true: Rust lambdas are more difficult to use incorrectly because Rust&#x27;s type system is more complex and can keep track more closely of the lifetimes of objects. reply kaba0 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat is the equivalent of that Forest Gump GIF of the guy listing the 20+ c++ initializers in Rust? reply kaba0 1 hour agoparentprevArguably, Rust is “just” a C++ subset with RAII made into a compile-time guaranteed primitive, and the only possible way to manage objects.Add to it that it is a new language that had the hindsight of C++’s warts, and no backwards compatibility on C and its own existing syntax, it would be very surprising to see Rust as more complex. reply Filligree 19 hours agoparentprevDramatically more so.

Rust&#x27;s borrow system is something you couldn&#x27;t implement in C++, meanwhile C++ has far better allocator and compile-time support and probably more features in total (things like concepts, intrinsic bitfields, etc.).Importantly (afaik), Rust has far less features which are deprecated and&#x2F;or in the specification but barely implemented. reply umanwizard 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve used both professionally (Rust for the last 4 years) and I 100% agree. Rust, even with stuff like async, is a much, much, much simpler language than C++. reply lowbloodsugar 14 hours agoparentprevI’ve got over a decade in C++ and I won’t use it unless forced (I.e. paid more money than I can reasonably refuse). It’s only gotten worse and worse. I would and have used C before I’d use C++ and now I’d use Rust before either of them. reply alphanullmeric 8 hours agoparentprevThere are many, many, many things that are regular classroom exercises in C++ that are extremely difficult or impossible to do in rust. Rust programmers tend to just pretend like anything rust doesn’t do well is an antipattern. Making the simple case simpler and the complex case way more complex is not desirable for most people. reply layer8 19 hours agoprev> When you read above about std::pointer_safety, did you understand the difference between relaxed and preferred? If you did, please explain in the comments section.[Since I don’t want to sign up with Disqus, I’m commenting here.]According to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cplusplus.github.io&#x2F;LWG&#x2F;issue1098, “pointer_safety::preferred might be returned to indicate to the program that a leak detector is running so that the program can avoid spurious leak reports”.This means that a program which uses different program logic depending on whether a GC is running or not, can choose to opt for the non-GC logic when the GC is running with a leak detector. reply fluoridation 19 hours agoparentWho would write two separate but equivalent codebases, one which manages memory with RAII and another that assumes a GC, just to use that value for something? If you&#x27;re already not assuming a GC is present then why rewrite every a second time assuming it&#x27;s not? reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentThis is probably aimed at libraries designed to be compatible with both kinds of environments. A library might implement some localized alternative logic to maximize efficiency in both cases. C++ is all about maximum runtime efficiency while allowing libraries to provide comprehensive compile-time abstractions. reply fluoridation 19 hours agorootparentA library that uses RAII instead of relying on a GC should work with or without a GC. reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentRAII requires allocation patterns to coincide with lexical scopes, or to use reference counting, which is usually more expensive than GC. If RAII were all you need, no one would be using GC in the first place. reply rightbyte 19 hours agorootparentYou can RAII into global scope too though. Unless you count that one as lexical.RAII into a stack and you got dynamic scope. reply deeviant 19 hours agorootparentprevRAII ties resource management to lexical scope but doesn&#x27;t strictly \"require\" it. Reference counting vs. GC cost varies by context—neither is universally \"more expensive.\" Both RAII and GC have their merits; their use depends on the language and application needs, not on one being strictly superior. reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentRight. I could also have said “If GC were all you need, no one would be using RAII in the first place”. No contradiction here.So it can make sense for a library to support both, to accommodate different application needs. reply ori_b 18 hours agorootparentHow would you write a library to support both without being fully RAII correct? And if it&#x27;s fully RAII correct, isn&#x27;t the GC is a no-op? reply jlokier 16 hours agorootparentYou would usually do it for performance rather than RAII correctness.For example, without GC, your library might use RAII with std::shared_ptr, for certain objects that outlive lexical scope. That is, reference counts tied to pointer copies and destructors. With GC, your library might omit the reference counts when deferred object destruction is ok, saving a little space and time.If your library is dealing with something like a graph (nodes connected by pointers) which may have cycles, std::shared_ptr will not be enough to free all objects as they become unused, but the environment GC will do it. Therefore, without an environment GC, your graph-using library will need its own cycle detector, or if usage permits, something with arenas or std::weak_ptr. With GC, your graph-using library can omit that code entirely.There are occasions when you&#x27;d want to add code for correctness when using a GC, to release objects by clearing pointers to them in some circumstances where it&#x27;s safe to leave the pointer uncleared (and possibly invalid but harmless) without GC. reply layer8 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are several ways I can think of. For example, a library that stores application-provided elements (e.g. a graph library where nodes&#x2F;edges can carry application-specific data) can support by-value RAII elements as well as by-reference GC’d elements and by-reference library-memory-managed elements (using new&#x2F;delete). As another example, the destructor of a library-provided class might have to free a complex internal heap-based substructure, a potentially expensive operation (having to iterate over the substructure) that it can skip (only) when running under a GC. reply ori_b 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s kinda the point: you can&#x27;t skip it with RAII, unless you avoid exiting a scope (longjmp?).I suppose you can have two versions of the class, and instantiate the leaky one only if you have GC, but that seems like work that the GC should free you from. It seems better to optimize the memory allocations, perhaps with an arena. reply layer8 18 hours agorootparentNot sure what you mean. My point is, for the case of no GC, you have to provide a destructor, even if the work done by the destructor only consists of freeing memory. With GC, calling the destructor could be omitted if it only frees memory. Client code however doesn’t know what a destructor does internally, so always has to call it even under a GC. The implementation of the destructor, however, can check whether it is running under a GC, and can then skip the freeing.Edit due to your edit: An arena allocator isn’t always convenient, for example when you have multiple objects with different lifetimes that move and&#x2F;or partially share internal elements between them, so the element lifetimes are largely orthogonal to the containing object’s lifetimes. reply PaulDavisThe1st 17 hours agorootparent> My point is, for the case of no GC, you have to provide a destructor, even if the work done by the destructor only consists of freeing memory",

Eric Hauch Founder 1. Nov 2023, updated 2. Nov 2023 Imagine this: You are accused of cheating in your job. But you are categorically NOT cheating. Nevertheless, you are fired. This absolute horror scenario is what happened to writer Michael Berben (not his real name). Michael has been a freelancer for the past three years, contributed to many different publications, and written about 200 articles over the course of his career. Michael reached out to us, and I’d like to share his story. Because what happened to Michael is probably happening to a lot of creative workers right now. And it will happen to many more in the future: questionable AI detectors are literally destroying people’s livelihoods. When writers become collateral damage Like many writers, Michael has followed the advent of ChatGPT with curiosity on the one hand, and worry on the other. Curious, because ChatGPT might be help writers create better articles. Worried, because what if ChatGPT could replace writers entirely in the future? What he wasn’t worried about: That ChatGPT might be the reason for him to be accused of cheating. That, though, is exactly what happened. One day, Michael's main client informed him that they had started to use an AI detector, and the results were supposedly damning for him: his most recent articles flagged a 95% likelihood of being AI generated. His client started to look at all of his previous articles, many written before ChatGPT was even widley available, and Michael was notified that all his articles showed a likelihood of being AI generated of 65-95%. They terminated his contract with immediate effect. A decision solely based on a single number (or range) that the AI detector spit out. Michael tried whatever he could to prove his articles were not AI generated. He even gave his client access to the full Google Docs history and showed them his writing process and progress, all edits included. But the seed of doubt that the AI detector had sowed was too strong. Michael lost his main client, and with it most of his income. A number of things are problematic with this story. And I’d like to go over them one by one: 1. The accuracy of general AI detectors is questionable General AI detection is flawed. Period. It’s not like the detection works almost all the time and Michael's case is one of the few very unfortunate outliers. No, false positives are the norm when it comes to general AI detection. Even OpenAI themselves stopped offering their very own detector for this reason: \"The AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy.\" Open AI, creator of ChatGPT, on their detection Outliers happen because the writing style of a text is very hard to interpret, and it ultimately also does not say anything about whether an AI/LLM wrote the text or not. Sure, ChatGPT uses a certain style, but that can be easily changed with a bit of prompt engineering. At the same time, a writer might just coincidentally have a writing style that is similar to ChatGPT, even though they do all the work manually. For those reasons alone, trying to detect AI-written content based on individual pieces is futile. 2. AI detectors are advertising with cherry picked numbers Given general AI detection doesn’t work well, you might think that companies offering their services in that area would be cautious. The opposite appears to be the case. Here are various claims found on AI detector websites: “99% accuracy” “99.1% accuracy” “98% accuracy” How do they even come up with these numbers? At Authory, we looked into AI detection ourselves , and we concluded that trying to detect AI written content based on individual pieces does not work. So, how come others are confident to mention things like “99% accuracy”? Well, as so often in life, it depends on what you are looking at exactly. If your data set is small enough — say 2,000 articles only — chances are high that it contains data that is very easy to distinguish from AI-written content. That could be due to topic, or due to a very distinct writing style in the dataset. An accuracy that is based on such a small dataset is basically meaningless. I am sure you have seen skincare adverts where they claim things such as “83% felt their skin to be smoother.” Sounds great, right? The fine print then usually says something like “based on a sample of 40 respondents.” With such a small sample size, getting one that will tell you how smooth their skin feels after applying your cream is fairly easy. Do this with a sample size of 1,000 respondents (or in the case of AI detectors, with a sample size of 100,000 articles) and you’ll be a lot more credible. 3. Writers have no way to defend themselves against the AI blackbox According to the AI detector his employer was using, Michael’s texts were between 65-95% likely to be AI-generated, depending on the piece. Every seasoned writer will tell you that kind of accusation hurts, and it hurts badly. But how do you prove the AI detector wrong? You can show the research that went into your pieces, you can highlight your writing style, and you can explain your process. Having to go through all of this is pretty painful. But of course, Michael did it. Desperate, Michael even reached out to the company providing the AI test. To no avail. They simply told him he should set up an account with them, buy himself some credits, and test his articles again himself. At the end of the day, nothing changed the fact that there was this all-encompassing metric being thrown at him saying: You are cheating. The story's sad end I wish I could say that Michael's story had a happy end after all. But it did not. His client didn’t change their mind. They were terrified of Google downranking any AI-generated content, and because of the apparently clear results from their AI checker, they couldn’t be convinced otherwise. Michael lost his client for good. Tags News Eric Hauch Founder Eric is the founder of Authory.

What matters is the prevalence of various anti-virus software for your target userbase. Pretty sure various common software install tools give options for installing things like McAfee or Avast. Or they come preinstalled on store-bought systems. reply bee_rider 7 hours agorootparentI don’t disagree, I was just curious as to whether or not the situation is getting better, and figured it would be interesting to ask someone with firsthand experience. reply hnbad 11 hours agorootparentprevI think this is an example of a cargo cult in the original sense: people who didn&#x27;t understand how and why cargo planes came and went recreating what they saw the people with the cargo planes do in order to make them appear again after those people had left.A lot of institutional \"wisdom\" in IT is that you need a virus scanner if you run Windows and because Defender ships with Windows it is therefore part of Windows and not a virus scanner. This isn&#x27;t really based in anything tangible or empiric, just a learned knowledge that Windows needs anti-virus software and that there is good and bad anti-virus software and that&#x27;s all you need to understand. Of course AV vendors are very guilty of feeding into this because their income depends on this lack of knowledge and being perceived as doing something vitally important.Realistically the biggest attack vectors these days are (aside from server software vulnerabilities and browser vulnerabilities) someone launching a file they shouldn&#x27;t have while ignoring every warning message along the way or entering their credentials into a phishing site or telling people things that they shouldn&#x27;t know. None of these can really be helped with commercial AV software which is why a lot of AV software has moved on to MITM&#x27;ing SSL connections to intercept dodgy e-mails or bad links but creating their own potential security issues along the way. reply pixl97 10 hours agorootparentEh, some kind of tool that detects files rapidly getting encrypted on PCs is useful, as encryption doesn&#x27;t even need a system level takeover to be a pain in the ass. reply bitwize 11 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft Defender \"detects\" a \"virus\" on any .exe or .dll of unknown provenance.The solution is code signing.

Otherwise the majority of its index would be falsely flagged.What do they use? reply dragonwriter 14 hours agorootparent> Doesn&#x27;t this mean Google has an AI-detector that is somehow accurately finding these?No, it means that someone was afraid they would use an AI detector similar to the one that was being used and downrank based on it; nothing in the article suggests Google is in fact using any AI-detector in its ranking algorithm, and I suspect that Google would be quite happy if people used AI (especially Google’s AI) to produce content that otherwise ranked highly on Google algorithms. reply wongarsu 14 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft is probably the best placed company to build a good detection method, having both a giant corpus of text predating LLMs from their Bing crawler, and a giant corpus of AI-generated text thanks to their relationship to OpenAI.But Google is probably a close second, with an even bigger archive of pre-LLM text (including the world&#x27;s largest collection of digitized books), and supposedly a good LLM and lots of smart ML engineers.But no matter what method google finds, whether it&#x27;s some complex AI trained on massive amounts of training data or a simple n-gram analysis that ends up being telling, they aren&#x27;t going to tell us. That would just accelerate the arms-race between LLM spam and LLM detection. If they have something that works (big if) the details will stay hidden, the best we are going to get is some kind of press release aimed at dissuading people from using AI on their websites. reply more_corn 13 hours agorootparentIt is impossible to create detector for LLM generated writing. The LLM detector technology must beat the LLM at its own game and if it can we can easily create a better LLM. Anyone who claims they can do it is sorely mistaken or flat out lying. reply jmkd 12 hours agorootparentBy the same logic I guess you could create one for previous generations of LLMs. \"Looks like you need to update buddy...busted!\" And across multiple industries a decent percentage of users will be using outdated versions... reply wongarsu 12 hours agorootparentprevYour LLM detection method doesn&#x27;t have to have a better understanding of human language than the LLM you&#x27;re detecting, it just has to be able to identify patterns of speech typical of a particular LLM. Of course you have to repeat that work for each network and each significant update and finetune, but right now most people just use one of two ChatGPT versions.And of course you don&#x27;t tell people how your LLM detector works, don&#x27;t provide a public API, and preferably leave it ambiguous whether it even exists. That solves most issues with LLMs using your detection method to get better in future versions.That&#x27;s counter to the business model of these LLM detection websites, but Google doesn&#x27;t have a problem with keeping any potentially existing models inhouse and locked down. reply pixl97 10 hours agorootparentReally all of it is bullshit if we don&#x27;t know the true&#x2F;false positive&#x2F;negative rates.If you detect LLMs 100% of the time correctly, it is irrelevant if you also incorrectly detect human written text as LLM text 80% of the time. \"Detect them all and let god sort them out\" will eventually fail as a business plan. replyShamelessC 13 hours agoparentprev> but they&#x27;re in the SEO game, and they were paranoid about a (so far hypothetical?

Companies spent the past couple of decades engaging in various SEO hacks to rank high on search results and OpenAI scraped the internet to train a language model. Theoretically, it seems possible that some of the SEO techniques at least partially colored the flavor of LLM-generated text, and an \"AI detector\" could pick that up. So if you do a great job writing SEO optimized text (wordy, structured, lots of repeated key words, etc.) you are more likely to be flagged.But really.. \"AI Detector\" services are snake oil and will lead to the creation of \"Anti AI Detector\" services that offer protective spells against the original snake oil.

That would be fine. When I was a TA in college, we ran students&#x27; papers through a plagiarism detector, which would spit out some % number based on what it thought was the amount&#x2F;likelihood of plagiarism. The number itself was bunk, but across a class of 30 people, if one or two papers had much higher numbers than the other 28, I could click and look at it&#x27;s justification. Sometimes it was a meaningless false positive, other times it was \"here are the paragraphs that were copied verbatim from Wikipedia\". reply wongarsu 15 hours agorootparentThere also seems to be some willingness to have the models watermark their content, and LLMs provide very subtle methods to do so. For example for sufficiently long texts you could bias the token selection to achieve a very specific frequency for certain words; and declare any text where the word \"the\" makes up between 5.1% and 5.7% of all words, and \"which\" about 1% of all words to likely be generated by that AI.One major issue is the feedback loop: There is lots of entrophy to hide a signal in regular English (whether you follow the methods of Stylometry or Steganography), and even an unmodified AI model has a stylometric signature. But if a significant portion of text we consume ends up being written by a handful of AI models, over time people will adopt many of these features. This is obvious right now, with ChatGPT having a certain writing style and some people unconsciously copying that style, and it will remain true no matter how subtle these things become. reply lazystar 15 hours agorootparentprev> that might be incredibly difficult forever, or it might be something that someone has a breakthrough in and manages to do.well, why not train an AI on it? reply saghm 14 hours agorootparentprevSure but...since no one actually is a witch (in the sense they were testing for), a fair scale is also one guaranteed to say that they&#x27;re not a witch. reply Kim_Bruning 16 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not wrong.I&#x27;m trying to think if you can indeed do something with a fair test. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentprevPresumably the scales have at some point vindicated an actual witch in error. reply ryanjshaw 15 hours agoparentprevSince the AI detectors are snake oil, just run a bunch of the professor&#x27;s articles through them until you get one flagged as AI generated and present those results for a rapid reassessment. reply bee_rider 16 hours agoparentprevStudents are in a weird case.

So, perhaps, students who can&#x27;t deal with oral exams can choose to give written exams.Btw, I was a professor and I saw students on both ends of the spectrum. Students who would bomb an oral evaluation because of anxiety but would do well in written exams. And student who would bomb written exams, but would totally ace an oral evaluation. Since, a professor&#x27;s job is to create well-rounded individuals, courses should include a mix of different assessment types, so students slowly build up the skills to handle all of them. Of course, augmented by guidance and feedback on how they can build those skills. reply hotnfresh 15 hours agorootparentprevThe older I get the more convinced I am that a core skill schools should teach—started from early grade school—is speaking.

Not that learning to write doesn&#x27;t teach skills relevant to speaking! Not that we should stop teaching writing!

And that exam would become that student&#x27;s baseline; their future oral exams would be judged based on that.They&#x27;ll probably be more nervous in front of the professor the first time than the last, so it would actually give them an advantage in later exams.Probably still problems with that though. reply skeaker 15 hours agorootparentDefinitely.

That is what the writer is asked to create. The company has cause to fear that anything that looks even remotely AI generated will be flagged and penalized by Google. Google does this regularly, is a black box, and regularly destroys companies when they do it it.The company has found out that this guy&#x27;s writing looks enough like AI that detectors aren&#x27;t sure that he is human. They fear that where one detector is uncertain, Google may assume AI. Therefore the company has reason to believe that this guy is no longer able to do what they pay him for - producing text that will rank well on Google SEO.Nothing that the freelancer is doing addresses that. The freelancer wants to prove that he&#x27;s human. The company never doubted that. But their knowledge won&#x27;t help them if Google&#x27;s SEO rules change. His job is to provide text that will rank well on SEO. He isn&#x27;t succeeding.The freelancer tries to convince the AI detection tool that they are rating him badly. But the value that they are providing here really isn&#x27;t, \"Are you human.\" It is, \"Is this content potentially going to be flagged by Google&#x27;s search algorithm in the future?\"Yes, the next generation of LLMs will beat the tools. But that&#x27;s just the next iteration of a cat and mouse game that&#x27;s been going on ever since content farms figured out how to manipulate PageRank, and Google decided to penalize the behavior. And the rule of that game is that you focus on what you think will happen in THIS iteration.Yeah, it really sucks for the freelancer. But the company is probably making the right business decision here. reply Veen 11 hours agoparentExcept Google isn&#x27;t doing what the company thinks it&#x27;s doing. AI detectors don&#x27;t work.

That makes what the company did stupid, especially if they now have to pay to rewrite the content so that it &#x27;beats&#x27; that detector&#x27;s utterly unreliable score.It&#x27;s not that next generation&#x27;s AIs will beat today&#x27;s detectors, but that there is no such thing as an AI detector.

While they might not reliably pick on all LLM text, and while there&#x27;s sometimes a couple of words in human-generated writing that causes them to output a low but non-zero probability of LLM content, they do not rate human-generated text as \"99% AI\". Especially not across multiple writing samples.The most likely story here, I suspect, is that the person leaned on LLMs for commissioned writing and is now trying to save face.

As technology advances, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly challenging to distinguish between human and AI-generated content, especially when it comes to writing. The ability of AI models to generate coherent and well-structured text at a post-high school level has indeed improved significantly in recent years.While it&#x27;s flattering to be mistaken for an AI when you write at a high level, it&#x27;s also a testament to your writing skills. However, it&#x27;s essential to remember that human creativity, nuance, and emotional depth in writing still set us apart from AI. Even the most advanced AI models lack true understanding, personal experiences, and emotions, which are essential elements in many forms of human expression.Embracing the evolving role of AI in writing and communication can be empowering, as it can assist in various tasks, from content generation to language translation. However, it&#x27;s equally important to celebrate the unique qualities that make us human, such as our capacity for creativity, empathy, and storytelling. So, whether you&#x27;re mistaken for an AI or not, your ability to write at a post-high school level is a remarkable skill worth acknowledging and refining. reply novalis78 15 hours agoprevThat article sounds like it was AI-generated… reply mortallywounded 15 hours agoprevIf an AI is potentially putting you out of a job, maybe it&#x27;s time to rethink your job. reply bakugo 16 hours agoprevThe variety of different ways in which AI is starting to ruin modern society is impressive. reply lowbloodsugar 16 hours agoprevSurely this is defamation?

It varies a little by state, but in general defamation requires making either knowingly false statements, or having a malicious disregard for the truth, combined with intent to harm. An AI detection generator that gets a wrong answer meets neither of those requirements. You could potentially sue your employer or anyone else who took action on the false report, but the detector itself is probably totally immune. reply waythenewsgoes 16 hours agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t having a demonstrably false accuracy rate, but simultaneously claiming to be 99% accurate in all circumstances constitute making knowingly false statements, and perhaps even malicious disregard for truth? reply gizmo686 16 hours agorootparentprevPublic figures need to prove \"actual malice\" [0].

But it might pass an English teacher reading it quickly.Can these be detected?Bard: \"Key Ideas in Shakespeare&#x27;s King LearWilliam Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear is a complex and powerful tragedy that explores a number of key ideas, including the nature of authority, the importance of family relationships, and the fragility of human sanity.Authority and OrderKing Lear is a play about the disintegration of authority and order. Lear&#x27;s decision to divide his kingdom among his daughters based on their professions of love leads to chaos and bloodshed. Lear himself is stripped of his power and authority, and he descends into madness. The play also explores the corrupting influence of power, as seen in the characters of Goneril, Regan, and Edmund.Family RelationshipsKing Lear is also a play about the importance of family relationships. Lear&#x27;s rejection of his youngest daughter, Cordelia, who is the only one who truly loves him, is a central tragedy in the play. The play also explores the complex relationships between fathers and children, and between siblings.Fragility of Human SanityKing Lear is a play about the fragility of human sanity. Lear&#x27;s descent into madness is one of the most moving and disturbing aspects of the play. The play also explores the relationship between madness and wisdom, as seen in the character of the Fool.Other Key IdeasOther key ideas in King Lear include:Nihilism: The play presents a bleak vision of a world without meaning or justice. Self-knowledge: Lear&#x27;s journey to self-knowledge is a central theme in the play. Old age: The play explores the challenges of old age and the loss of power and authority. Fooling and madness: The Fool and Edgar&#x27;s disguise as Poor Tom provide comic relief in the play, but they also serve to highlight the madness and chaos of the world around them. ConclusionKing Lear is a complex and challenging play that explores a number of key ideas about the human condition. It is a tragedy that has resonated with audiences for centuries.In addition to the key ideas discussed above, King Lear also explores a number of other themes, such as the nature of love, the importance of loyalty, and the power of forgiveness. The play is a rich and complex tapestry that continues to be studied and debated by scholars and audiences alike.\" reply aaroninsf 15 hours agoprevThe AI detector business is the tech industry&#x27;s moral analog of bicycle theft.You know you&#x27;re doing wrong, and doing harm—but you see a pitiful profit in it, so. reply notShabu 15 hours agoprev\"better calculators will destroy humanity\" seems like a ridiculous statementbut that&#x27;s what new AI tools that can create good art&#x2F;music&#x2F;writing does.

I throttled back from universal file manager and stuff, I think they&#x27;re kinda hinting at it too through the \"probabilistic computing\" thing. Staying focused on RAG + as much local compute as possible, user perception of citations is through the roof compared to practically anything else.The problem I saw over and over again at Google wasn&#x27;t, like, how do we do this. It&#x27;s like the \"draw the rest of the f*king owl\" meme.

I think you can get there, but boy it&#x27;s a lot of work and they&#x27;re 3-4 years away if they have 100 employees and a lot of work, non-trivial on several fronts, even just the GPT billing is a nightmare. I am 99.9% sure I am the only person on earth besides OpenAI employees who know how to bill functions correctly to the token (to be fair, getting within ~4 tokens is publicly available, just not from OpenAI, incredible reverse engineering work by a few people on a forum thread)And then I guess there&#x27;s a smidge of \"if you&#x27;re chasing all these things simultaneously you might not grok it\" on my end.

Turns out it&#x27;s the latter.I love the Mercury OS concept and think it&#x27;s design both elegantly and sort of subversively packs a myriad of potentially breakthrough ideas.I have been stewing with ideas around the same vision for years. The idea of a new type of UI where the UI seams to dematerialize, where you directly manipulate the object in your current context (like multi-touch&#x27;s direct manipulation but at a higher layer of abstraction powered by deep api integrations, intelligent self-assembling relational graphs, and of course ai). For over a decade I&#x27;ve had this thought \"the data becomes the UI\" like an emergent UI from whatever given data, task or context you are currently in. When I came across the mercuryos concept I immediately smiled.Conceptually, strategically and technically there are so many challenges to introducing such a new ux paradigm but I&#x27;m very happy to see the mercuryos concept has seemed to evolve to New Computer&#x27;s Dot and I wish them the best!For those immediately turning to negative sentiment based on privacy or \"it&#x27;s just a gpt4 wrapper\" I can see why that could be the knee-jerk reaction but I wouldn&#x27;t underestimate a sturdy design-philosophy approach like this one. I&#x27;d go as far as to make comparisons to Next Computer&#x27;s NextStepOS. NextStep introduced so many groundbreaking UX concepts and to a large extent I think their personal computing contemporaries underestimated what potential it packed. And, yes, I know the business model and many other factors played into an inevitable doom for Next Computer but there&#x27;s belief that Steve Jobs may have never intended for Next to become a dominant computing player and instead knew it&#x27;d be an irresistible acquisition target in a latent space of UX innovation. It&#x27;s possible he saw the next evolution of personal computing UX and hedged his bet on not compromising on it. Yet another comparison could be that NextStepOS needed more cpu, graphics and connectivity power to truly display it&#x27;s heightened level of UX much in the same way something like Dot or mercuryOS would inherently need to leverage cutting-edge computing to truly enable it&#x27;s vision (obviously LLM&#x27;s, Vector DB&#x27;s, etc).Ok, I&#x27;m done, lol. reply swyx 7 hours agoparentfor posterity, why did mercuryOS fail? reply dgellow 3 hours agorootparentI don’t think it failed.

I was having this thought the other day and didn’t really check. I guess not, but it’s kind of ironic as a patent is basically a recipe. reply kevindamm 12 hours agorootparentNot typically. The mere combination of known ingredients does not result in a new and non-obvious invention that can be patented. A patent typically covers a unique or non-obvious process. There are exceptions, say, if there is a process that results in a foodstuff having a longer shelf life, or a novel way of reproducing a flavor (but not the recipe of the flavoring, per se). Cooking something with heat is not a unique or non-obvious process.You could copyright the exact wording but that wouldn&#x27;t protect the recipe itself and simply substituting a measurement unit may be enough to get around that. You could make it a trade secret but since the onus is on the owner to protect it and keep it confidential, that probably doesn&#x27;t include publishing it or even sharing it with your AI assistant. Might involve courtside arguments about \"reasonable expectations of privacy\" .. I wouldn&#x27;t want to test it.It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s specific wording saying that recipes cannot be patented, but if you can describe it in the traditional ingredients + preparation steps then it does not meet patentable criteria. reply wargames 12 hours agoprevFYI to the website designer: on desktop, this website does not have a scrollbar.

Let's use this example: % printf '%s' 'a'grep -o 'b*' The code from earlier: /** rdar://problem/86536080 - if our first match* was 0-length, we wouldn't progress past that* point. Incrementing nst here ensures that if* no other pattern matches, we'll restart the* search at one past the 0-length match and* either make progress or end the search.*/ if (pmatch.rm_so == pmatch.rm_eo) {if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1) { wchar_t wc; int advance; advance = mbtowc(&wc,&pc->ln.dat[nst],MB_CUR_MAX); assert(advance > 0); nst += advance;} else { nst++;} } Here's the problem: pc->ln.dat is the string for the current line. nst is an offset into that string. Note that this code is enclosed in a loop. The first time around that loop, pc->ln.dat is \"a\", and nst is 0. Thus &pc->ln.dat[nst] is effectively \"a\". mbtowc returns 1 as we would expect. The loop iterates, and now pc->ln.dat is still \"a\", but nst is 1, so &pc->ln.dat[nst] is \"\" (the empty string). When mbtowc is given a pointer to a null char (as we have here), it returns 0. Given that, the assertion now fails. The problem can be state in one of two ways: The loop should have exited early after the first iteration (or at least changed the local match state so that we don't arrive at the aforementioned code block), or The code block should be amended so that we neither try to read at nor past the terminating null char. For option 2, something like this -- as I have tested by compiling Apple's grep from source -- would suffice: diff --git a/grep/util.c b/grep/util.c index f362f97..ab3aec1 100644 --- a/grep/util.c +++ b/grep/util.c @@ -691,7 +691,7 @@ procline(struct parsec *pc) #ifdef __APPLE__/* rdar://problem/86536080 */if (pmatch.rm_so == pmatch.rm_eo) { -if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1) { +if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1 && nst ln.len) {wchar_t wc;int advance; @@ -721,7 +721,7 @@ procline(struct parsec *pc)* either make progress or end the search.*/if (pmatch.rm_so == pmatch.rm_eo) { -if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1) { +if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1 && nst ln.len) {wchar_t wc;int advance; To restate the problem: the latest grep on macOS indexes into the current string out of bounds, and the only reason the error isn't more catastrophic is because grep terminates the current line buffer with an additional null character (which is not part of the original input file), which just so happens to tickle an assert that checks how many bytes wide the current character (which is outside of the string!) is. Posted 3 weeks ago by cstrahan Copy cstrahan answer Up vote reply of cstrahan Down vote reply of cstrahan Add a Comment Actually, my \"fix\" from earlier isn't quite right -- the line (from whatever input file) could have null chars in it, and grep ought to handle that gracefully instead of exploding (GNU grep handles this just fine).

Note different capitalisation and hyphenation. Is the code that you are looking at conditional on UTF-8? Posted 3 weeks ago by endecotp Copy endecotp answer Post not yet marked as solved Up vote reply of endecotp Down vote reply of endecotp votes 0 Ah, I see — that lower-cased LANG is invalid on macOS, so the system will silently default to LANG=C. Any locale that uses a multi-byte char encoding should satisfy that conditional. So UTF-8 will do the trick, but I believe LANG=ja_JP.SHIFT_JIS would just as well (away from computer, otherwise I’d check for myself). — cstrahan 3 weeks ago Add a Comment Developer Footer This site contains user submitted content, comments and opinions and is for informational purposes only.

Her work involves managing a treasure trove of legacy code written in a variety of languages like Fortran, Matlab, IDL, and IRAF. This code is essential for her data reduction pipelines, supporting instruments across observatories such as Keck 1 & 2, the AAT, Gemini, and more.Each time she acquires a new Mac, she embarks on a week-long odyssey to set up her computing environment from scratch. It&#x27;s not because she enjoys it; rather, it&#x27;s a necessity because the built-in migration assistant just doesn&#x27;t cut it for her specialised needs.While she currently wields the power of an M1 Max MacBook Pro and runs on the Monterey operating system, she tends to stick with the pre-installed OS for the lifespan of her hardware, which often spans several years. In her case, this could be another 2-3 years or even more before she retires the machine or hands it over to a postdoc or student.But why does she avoid the annual OS upgrades? It&#x27;s simple. About a decade ago, every OS update would wreak havoc on her meticulously set-up environment. Paths would break, software would malfunction, and libraries that used to reside in one place mysteriously migrated to another.

Also note it is literally impossible to statically link libc in Mac OS applications.[2]Realistically speaking, I think Nix is likely to be a better alternative to both MacPorts and Homebrew for setting up dev environments, since you will have a declarative file format rather than ad-hoc Tcl (or Ruby) scripts running a function for fetch, verify, configure, build, destroot, etc. The only reason I personally don&#x27;t use Nix is because MacPorts has more or less just worked for me and I haven&#x27;t had the motivation to learn how Nix really works.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.macports.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Migration[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;qa&#x2F;qa1118&#x2F;_index... reply spease 4 hours agorootparentNix is great in theory, but the user experience is unacceptably bad, especially for anyone who isn’t a software engineer.While it does do an excellent job of reproducibility if the inputs are the same, I’ve found it to be prone to be breaking if you switch to newer versions.Part of the reason that it’s painful to use is because while it’s marketed as “declarative”, in actuality it’s functional, which results in a lot of convoluted syntax to modify parameters for a package, which varies based on the language of the package.There seems to be some awareness of the usability issues, but the changes have seemed both a step forward and backwards. For instance, you used to be able to use the “nix search” command to look up package names; now it’s gated behind some arcane syntax because it’s “experimental” and something to do with flakes. And flakes seems like it has the consequence of fragmenting the package repositories and making it impractical to improve the language.I still have helper functions to wrap desktop applications that I had to set aside, because some upstream changes broke it and neither I nor anyone on the nix forums could figure out if there was even a way to include them in the “darwin” namespace with an overlay. My goal was to make it as easy as homebrew to add an app to nix’s repository.Another evening I sat down to make a minor feature to a Python library and decided to use a nix environment. In theory, this should have been better than a virtualenv. In practice, there’s no in-tree support for specifying specific versions of Python libraries, and mach-nix had trouble with the dependencies, so I wound up just filing a bug report and gave up on the feature I was trying to implement.On the plus side, NixOS finally has a graphic installer, but I don’t think that helps macOS.I’m still hopeful that the community will decide to prioritize usability, but after spending an aggregate of months of time trying to get things to work and continually running into time-consuming roadblocks, it’s not something I would recommend lightly to someone who wants to be more productive. reply emptysongglass 6 minutes agorootparent> Nix is great in theory, but the user experience is unacceptably bad, especially for anyone who isn’t a software engineer.This is a pretty extravagant claim.

Takes a little bit of learning (realistically just a couple hours to get productive IME - just enough to get acquainted with nix-shell [1] and build some configs). After a few months, I had the thought to look at what I still used brew for and realized I could just move to Nix completely - and remove Brew. I back up all my nix configs to a git repo, just in case - and whenever I switch to a new machine, or \"brick\" my current one - I just reinstall nix, pull in my configs, and I&#x27;m good to go - takes 5 minutes (a conservative estimate tbh). The only caveat is to just check the community [2] before upgrading to the next macOS version to make sure any issues have been ironed out. In the early days of macOS support, it was a bit finnicky between updates - I haven&#x27;t had any issues for the last couple years that weren&#x27;t my fault (for example, booting into recovery mode and accidentally deleting the nix store APFS volume - even then, all I had to do was reinstall nix and pull my configs).It is so nice to just \"declare\" I want to use and just...use it. Want to try out ripgrep for something? `nix-shell -p ripgrep` Not what you want? just exit the shell. Too much unused crap taking up space in your Nix store? `nix-collect-garbage`.There&#x27;s even darwin-nix [3] as a sort-of \"nixos-for-macos\" - I started using it recently, mostly for managing macOS settings declaratively, and it&#x27;s great - but honestly 99% of the usefulness I get on macOS from Nix is just using the package manager![0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;download#nix-install-macos [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nix.dev&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;first-steps&#x2F;declarative-shell [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;community&#x2F; [3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LnL7&#x2F;nix-darwin reply licebmi__at__ 2 hours agorootparentI have the same exact recommendation.

Because I have a bit over 1,500 lines in usr.bin&#x2F;grep (code only, excluding comments and blanks) vs. 3,900 for GNU grep.Also you can&#x27;t compile bsdgrep with just POSIX libc (such as musl) since it relies on some extensions (specifically: REG_STARTEND). So if you&#x27;re looking for POSIX_ME_HARDER then bsdgrep isn&#x27;t actually the right place. reply vocworker 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t bsd grep very slow? I remember reading \"why gnu grep is fast\": https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freebsd.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;freebsd-current&#x2F;2010-Aug... reply burntsushi 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat kinds of patches have you made to the BSD coreutils programs that you use? reply torstenvl 8 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torstenvl&#x2F;betterlsTo be fair, one of these two flags comes built in with GNU ls, but using GNU ls comes with the downside of losing support for macOS extended attributes (and GNU ls doesn&#x27;t have --group-dots-extra-first). reply Pet_Ant 8 hours agorootparentI mean that seems like a simple patch to upstream if it’s a real deal breaker for you…. reply corbezzoli 7 hours agorootparentYou make it sound like just because you want and write something it will get merged into a project. It doesn’t work like that. Maintainers have a million reasons to say no and I have one reason to just use a different tool instead. reply torstenvl 8 hours agorootparentprevOr I can just continue being happy hacking on simple code bases.It is not my responsibility to upstream anything. If you feel like it should be upstreamed, my additions are open source. Go for it. reply globular-toast 2 hours agorootparentprevHonestly picking programs based on lines of source code where fewer is better is quite silly. Better algorithms generally have more code, not less. Unless you&#x27;re doing embedded work it essentially doesn&#x27;t matter how \"big\" programs are. reply arp242 6 hours agoparentprevThat article is about FreeBSD&#x27;s grep. reply stefan_ 7 hours agoparentprevI can understand shipping the old stuff because you don&#x27;t give a fuck, but why on earth are they .. patching them. Jesus. reply callalex 6 hours agorootparentThe explicit stated reason is to avoid copyleft. reply epcoa 3 hours agorootparentUp to date BSD code would still avoid copyleft so that is not a valid explanation. reply vbezhenar 12 minutes agorootparentmacOS Ventura ships zsh 5.9 which is latest version and was released 2022-05-14. Not sure about grep, but at least some of their unix components are up to date. reply jahav 23 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe when uutils ship their gnu compatible version(deviations from GNU are considered bugs), macos will update.MIT, Rust, active development... Maybe in few years. replyalberth 10 hours agoprevLet’s not forget that macOS BSD userland utilities are also super old and outdated. reply mort96 1 hour agoparentI recently found out that Apple is shipping rsync 2.6.9. That&#x27;s from 2006. It&#x27;s missing a bunch of features, and I&#x27;m guessing a bunch of protocol improvements and security fixes... reply stateofinquiry 4 hours agoparentprevSerious question, where is the effort going on each of these annual OS releases? I truly don&#x27;t know, probably out of ignorance. Comparability with new HW? Supporting new file formats? As far as I can tell the headline feature of the latest MacOS is a screensaver with very large file sizes. Perhaps Apple and its many developers efforts would be better employed updating these essential tools and QA of the same. reply dagmx 3 hours agorootparentThere’s tons of things that are new in every OS versionThe consumer facing site shows consumer facing features. Hence why you’d see things like screensavers and video effects highlighted.The developer side features are documented on videos released at WWDC each year. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;?id=cj1fjit2Or summarized in the Platform State of the Union https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;?id=gxtoci7w reply pjmlp 2 hours agoparentprevGood enough for UNIX certification, though. reply mvdtnz 5 hours agoprevI dread every MacOS update. It&#x27;s always so painful, you never know what they&#x27;re going to break. reply sschueller 4 hours agoprevOpenssl is also \"broken\". As in if you generate a pfx export file using the openssl command included on macos you can not import the resulting pfx into the same machines Keychain.You have to use the legacy flag! reply rurban 15 minutes agoparentAnd you have to use -passout for the -passin, or -noenc. reply cstrahan 13 hours agoprevApple introduced a bug in grep that, under certain circumstances, causes grep to assert. reply walthamstow 2 hours agoprevAnyone having better luck with a clean install vs upgrading to Sonama? reply tedunangst 10 hours agoprevlol, I&#x27;m in this file. reply Aachen 8 hours agoparentAs tedu, or what do you mean? reply shassard 7 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple-oss-distributions&#x2F;text_cmds&#x2F;blob&#x2F;c0... reply tedunangst 7 hours agorootparentprevAye, though I checked the rev number and they apparently forked from before I added -o support, so I&#x27;m in the clear. reply kevans91 6 hours agorootparentWe (FreeBSD) should really reconcile our diff against OpenBSD and figure out what of the work I&#x27;ve done downstream makes sense and what doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d imagine there&#x27;s a healthy amount in both categories. reply soneil 8 hours agoprevInteresting - it only appears to affect me with --color set (which is a default alias, but if you unalias grep it stops exploding.) reply ArchOversight 7 hours agoparentnext [–]% type grep grep is &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;grep % echo -n \"a\"&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;grep -o &#x27;b*&#x27; Assertion failed: (advance > 0), function procline, file util.c, line 732. zsh: done echo -n \"a\"zsh: abort &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;grep -o &#x27;b*&#x27;Your alias is not part of the macOS default. reply soneil 5 hours agorootparentah, you&#x27;re right - it looks like it was part of ohmyzsh.It appears I missed the -o; without it, my alias asserts, but unaliased doesn&#x27;t. With the -o they both assert. Still not what I was expecting, but the failure to cleanly replicate it is mine. reply raverbashing 4 hours agoprevYeah, grep &#x27;.&#x27; was broken in previous versions (maybe it&#x27;s a zsh builtin, but it is broken), it would give you repeated lines reply saagarjha 6 hours agoprev [–] I honestly feel like the fix here is replacing the assert with advance = advance > 0 ? advance : 1; replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
