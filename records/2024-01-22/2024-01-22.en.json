It loves hacking digital stuff, such as radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more. It's fully open-source and customizable, so you can extend it in whatever way you like. BUY NOW What is Flipper Zero Your cyber buddy The idea of Flipper Zero is to combine all the hardware tools you'd need for exploration and development on the go. Flipper was inspired by the pwnagotchi project, but unlike other DIY boards, Flipper is designed with the convenience of everyday usage in mind — it has a robust case, handy buttons, and shape, so there are no dirty PCBs or scratchy pins. Flipper turns your projects into a game, reminding you that development should always be fun. Flipper Zero is a tiny piece of hardware with a curious personality of a cyber-dolphin. It can interact with digital systems in real life and grow while you use it. Explore any kind of access control system, RFID, radio protocols, and debug hardware using GPIO pins. 1.4\" monochrome LCD display 128x64 px, ultra-low power sunlight-readable 5-button directional pad Status LED Back button Flipper Zero is completely autonomous and can be controlled with a 5-button directional pad without additional devices, such as computers or smartphones. Main features are available from the Main Menu. For more control, you can connect to Flipper Zero via USB and Bluetooth. Instead of a TFT, IPS or OLED, we decided to build in a cool old-school LCD. GPIO pins 3.3V logic levels (5V tolerant for input) Infrared transceiver Lanyard loop USB Type-C Power & charging Firmware update MicroSD card slot 1-Wire pogo pins Sub-1 GHz Transceiver Sub-1 GHz Range This is the operating range for a wide class of wireless devices and access control systems, such as garage door remotes, boom barriers, IoT sensors and remote keyless systems. Users can expand their Flipper Zero capabilities by installing additional apps to read data from various devices including weather stations. Flipper has an integrated multi-band antenna, and a CC1101 chip, making it a powerful transceiver with a range of up to 50 meters. CC1101 is a universal transceiver designed for very low-power wireless applications. It supports various types of digital modulations such as 2-FSK, 4-FSK, GFSK and MSK, as well as OOK and flexible ASK shaping. You can perform any digital communication in your applications such as connecting to IoT devices and access control systems. Customizable radio platform Garage doors and barriers Sub-1 GHz antenna TI CC1101 chip Smart sockets and bulbs IoT sensors and doorbells 125 kHz RFID Low-frequency proximity cards This type of card is widely used in old access control systems around the world. It's pretty dumb, stores only an N-byte ID and has no authentication mechanism, allowing it to be read, cloned and emulated by anyone. A 125 kHz antenna is located on the bottom of Flipper Zero — it can read low-frequency proximity cards and save them to memory to emulate later. You can also emulate cards by entering their IDs manually. Moreover, Flipper Zero owners can share card IDs remotely with other Flipper Zero users. NFC High-frequency proximity cards Flipper Zero has a built-in NFC module (13.56 MHz). Along with the 125 kHz RFID module, it turns Flipper Zero into an ultimate RFID device operating in both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) ranges. The NFC module supports all the major standards. It works pretty much the same as the 125 kHz module, allowing you to interact with NFC-enabled devices — read, write and emulate HF tags. Bluetooth Full Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support allows Flipper Zero to act as a peripheral device, allowing you to connect your Flipper Zero to 3rd-party devices and smartphones. Our mobile developers have designed apps for iOS and Android that let you update your Flipper Zero via BLE, remotely control the device, share keys, and manage data on a larger screen. Download Mobile Apps Infrared Transmitter The infrared transmitter can transmit signals to control electronics such as TVs, air conditioners (AC), stereo systems, and others. Flipper Zero has a built-in library of signals for common TV, AC, projectors, stereo systems brands. This library is constantly updated by the Flipper Zero community by adding new signals to the IR Remote database. Flipper Zero also has an IR receiver that can receive signals and save them to the library, so you can store any of your existing remotes to transmit commands later, and add them to the public IR Remote database to share with other Flipper Zero users. Infrared learning feature Infrared Transceiver Infrared receiver MicroSD card There is a variety of data Flipper Zero has to store: remote codes, signal databases, dictionaries, image assets, logs, and more. All this data is stored on a microSD card. The microSD card slot has a push-push type connector, so the card is reliably secured inside without sticking out. Flipper Zero supports any FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT formatted microSD cards to store your assets so you’ll never have to worry the memory will run out. External storage for apps and data Hand strap hole Tool for Hardware Exploration Hand strap hole Flipper Zero is a versatile tool for hardware exploration, firmware flashing, debugging, and fuzzing. It can be connected to any piece of hardware using GPIO to control it with buttons, run your own code and print debug messages to the LCD. It can also be used as a regular USB to UART, SPI, I2C, etc adapter. SPI, UART, I2C to USB converter Communicate with any hardware from your desktop application. Flashing and debugging tools SPI Flash Programmer AVR ISP Programmer OpenDAP Fuzzing tool Test any protocols and signals. Flipper Zero features built-in 5V and 3.3V power pins. Control the device with the help of the built-in buttons and display, so no PC is required. Completely Autonomous Flipper Zero has a built-in 1-Wire connector to read iButton contact keys. This old technology is still widely used around the world. It uses the 1-Wire protocol that doesn't have any authentication. Flipper can easily read these keys, store IDs in the memory, write IDs to blank keys and emulate the key itself. Flipper Zero has a unique iButton contact pad design — its shape works both as a reader and a probe to connect to iButton sockets. iButton 1-Wire + _ 1-Wire keys (Touch Memory) What's inside Tech specs MCU (Microcontroller unit) Display Model: STM32WB55RG Application processor: ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit 64 MHz Radio processor: ARM Cortex-M0+ 32-bit 32 MHz Radio: Bluetooth LE 5.4, 802.15.4 and proprietary Flash: 1024 KB (shared between application and radio) SRAM: 256 KB (shared between application and radio) LCD Monochrome Resolution: 128x64 px Controller: ST7567 Interface: SPI Diagonal Size: 1.4“ Sub-1 GHz module Transceiver: CC1101 TX Power: -20 dBm max Frequency bands (depends on your region): ● 315 MHz ● 433 MHz ● 868 MHz ● 915 MHz Buzzer Frequency: 100-2500 Hz Sound Output: 87 dB Type: Coin Vibration Motor Battery LiPo 2100 mAh Up to 28 days battery life Micro SD Body Size: 100x40x25 mm (3.95x1.58x1.01 inches) Weight: 102 grams (3.6 ounces) Materials: PC, ABS, PMMA Operating temperature: 0° to 40° C (32° to 104° F) GPIO 13 I/O pins available to user on external 2.54 mm connectors 3.3V CMOS Level Input 5V tolerant (See AN4899) Up to 20 mA per digital pin Bluetooth LE 5.4 TX power: 4 dBm max RX sensitivity: -96 dBm Data rate: 2 Mbps Infrared RX wavelength: 950 nm (+/-100nm) RX carrier: 38 KHz (+/-5%) TX wavelength: 940 nm TX carrier: 0-2 MHz TX power: 300 mW Supported protocols: ● NEC family ● Kaseikyo ● RCA ● RC5, RC6 ● Samsung ● SIRC NFC Transceiver: ST25R3916 Frequency: 13.56 MHz Supported cards: ● ISO-14443A/B ● NXP MIFARE Classic®, Ultralight®, DESFire® etc. ● FeliCa™ ● HID iClass (Picopass) ● NFC Forum protocols Frequency: 125 kHz Modulation: AM/OOK Coding: AKS, PSK Supported cards: ● EM400x, EM410x, EM420x ● HID ● Indala ● FDX (A & B) ● Pyramid ● AWID ● Viking ● Jablotron ● Paradox ● PACStanley ● Keri ● Gallagher ● Nexwatch RFID 125 kHz Force value: 30 N Speed: 13500 rpm Up to 256 GB microSD card (SPI mode) 2-32 GB card recommended Read/Write speed: up to 5 Mbps Supported file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT Control 5-button directional pad Back button USB Type-C, USB 2.0 (12 Mbps) USB device Charging (1A max) iButton 1-Wire Supported protocols: ● Dallas DS199x, DS1971 ● CYFRAL ● Metakom ● TM2004 ● RW1990 GPIO Pinout Full size image Live 3D model Follow Flipper's Progress Your E-mail SUBMIT No spam, only important stuff For developers Community Distributors Copyright © 2023 Flipper Devices Inc.

My favorite use case is the IR remote since phones no longer have IR blasters. It's saved me twice so far in having to buy/find a remote for something. One thing people don't realize is that the custom firmware [0] that you can run allows you to receive and transmit on a wide range of frequencies under 1Ghz. Lots of things use that range (garage doors, gates, fan remotes, etc.) and are not very secure. I think that this will be a time looked back on where it's possible to interact with those devices without having to buy a custom PCB transmitter or somewhat expensive and complex SDR. [0] https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware reply CraigJPerry 1 hour agoparent>> or somewhat expensive and complex SDR I don’t think that’s as accurate today as it used to be. On the hardware side there are tons of options very cheaply available - iirc the flipper uses the c1100 (or a number like that) it’s a popular cheap chip and it’s well documented and interfaces easily with arduino. More accessibly, lime mini SDRs are cheap but there’s quite a few alternatives too. On the software side GNU Radio is free with decent tutorials - we’re not talking anything like blender levels of difficulty to adopt even if it is a complex domain. Although on the more accessible side, urh is incredibly powerful given how easy to use it is https://github.com/jopohl/urh I used the latter to tap into a 2 channel wireless bbq thermometer via a $10 rtl sdr and that was a breeze, an absolute walk in the park compared to when I reverse engineered the flysky telemetry system. reply ale42 27 minutes agorootparentGNU radio is free, but what about the hardware you need if you want to transmit an actual signal? reply tiagod 15 minutes agorootparentAn HackRF clone is quite a bit cheaper than a Flipper, and it's a full-blown SDR with TX capability reply elliottcarlson 15 minutes agoparentprevThe batteries died in my bedroom TV remote a few nights ago, it wasn't until I went to replace them did I notice that one of the batteries had leaked and seems to have caused some corrosion on the contact, so until I clean it up I've switched to my Flipper Zero as the remote for it (just need power and audio control, rest is via a Roku stick). Never thought this would be my use case for it, but it worked out perfectly. reply dheerajvs 5 hours agoparentprev> phones no longer have IR blasters Plently of phones still do [0]. I've configured mine to operate all my devices at home. [0] https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2023&chkInfra... reply BossingAround 1 hour agorootparentIn other words, Chinese brands still have IR blasters. I don't know I would trust Chinese-brand of phones though. reply sofixa 1 hour agorootparentWhy not? Most phones are manufactured in China anyways, and Xiaomi, OnePlus, Honor, Oppo are major and very widely popular and used brands all over the world (outside of the US which is allergic to Chinese brands unless it's for cheap crap or to outsource manufacturing to). reply chpatrick 57 minutes agorootparentprevIn terms of functionality they're night and day compared to Western brands which seem to just enshittify their devices while raising prices. They're all made in China at the end of the day. reply ChuckMcM 9 hours agoprevThis is a super fun gizmo, it's discord channel is, uh, not great. One cool thing is that you can talk to it serially. I pretty quickly had it organized with an IoT temperature sensor so that it could send commands to my ceiling fan given the temperature in my office. I have also used it to capture the NFC code on a hotel card key so that I could still get into my room even after my key was inevitably \"damaged\" by nearness to other fields. Some parts of it are silly, like the Tomagachi type game with the dolphin. Doesn't add value for me, but I can see how it might be something for someone. There is also growing awareness with agencies about its flexibility, some apocryphal stories of them being confiscated by TSA checkpoints have come in. Writing your own apps for them has a fairly high learning curve. reply tekeous 1 hour agoparentThe dolphin game is to allow them to avoid some import/export restrictions by classifying it as a toy, which it is, and not a hacking tool. It’s not a professional device. reply justsid 6 hours agoparentprevThe Discord server is terrible. It’s both overrun with kids and yet also weirdly harshly moderated. The device itself is fantastic though. Gives me some real Pebble vibes in all of the best ways. It’s very hackable and even though I don’t do crazy pentest things with it, it’s just an overall fun device. reply m0llusk 7 hours agoparentprevThe dolphin annoyed me immediately, but it turns out that all of the graphic assets are simple to find in the firmware so it should be quite easy to change the look and feel of operation into something other than fun time with dolphin friend. reply futhey 6 hours agoprevWhen people realized anyone with a sophisticated police scanner could listen in on cordless (and then early cellular) phone calls, it forced manufacturers to actually implement a bare-minimum level of security on those devices. I hope this pushes more manufacturers to switch to rolling-code algorithms (like the key fob your car uses), in place of simpler, less secure codes that can be captured and replayed. reply ChrisArchitect 9 hours agoprevRecent news discussions: Flipper Zero can be used to crash iPhones running iOS 17 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37919396 Apple Shuts Down Flipper Zero's Ability to Shut Down iPhones https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38656607 Flipper Zero banned by Amazon for being a ‘card skimming device’ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35481580 UK airport confiscates passenger's Flipper Zero https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37707486 reply ulucs 1 hour agoparentThe last one is hilarious, just endless speculation on how the guy could have handled it better, the guy coming in with the account of how he handled thing pretty nicely, and then just crickets. reply Alifatisk 57 minutes agoparentprevSomeone on Twitter mentioned how some kid managed to crash and shutdown their insulin pump using the flipper zero. reply Mad_ad 52 minutes agorootparentsource? sounds fishy to me, can't believe insulin pumps are so vulnerable. reply ablation 33 minutes agorootparentI don't have a source for OP's Flipper Zero story, but insulin pumps are surprisingly vulnerable: https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsm... reply some-natalie 6 hours agoprevIt's good as a bluetooth presentation remote, sharing QR codes or NFC contact info at conferences, and jiggling your mouse so your VPN connection doesn't die when your laptop locks up. It was handy around the house over the holidays too (https://some-natalie.dev/blog/flipper-at-home/). It's a decent multitool. :-) reply byb 4 hours agoprevI tried using a Flipper with some NFC stickers so I wouldn't have to carry around so many FOBs and cards. It turns out that the Flipper does not excel at this task. It complained that the NFC stickers I bought were non-writable. And it couldn't read all the sectors on some NFC tags. However, I was able to use the Android MCT app to write to the same stickers and read the tags the flipper couldn't read. Cloning required copying strings to the clipboard, which is something the Flipper's UI is not really designed for. reply blep-arsh 4 hours agoparentYeah, Flipper as a concept sounds cool but then I found out the current implementation is rather half-baked and comes with a lot of limitations. And the community is not that welcoming either. reply LZ2DMV 9 hours agoprevApart from access control systems, it hardly has any good uses in the real world as a pen-testing device. If it was a pocket carry, true SDR, capable of recording RF signals as I/Q, performing actions on them, replaying them, etc, it would have justified its cost. But, with a limited set of modulations supported by the used RF chips, it is more like a toy for hacker wanna-be teenagers than a serious tool. An investment in something like HackRF+PortaPack clone is far better, IMHO. reply tkems 8 hours agoparentTotally agree that this isn't a good full pentesting device, but I also think that such a device doesn't need to be in order to be popular. Just look at the IM-ME when Samy Kamkar showed it off [0] and it sold out. Most people don't need a full SDR like a HackRF in order to explore their RF devices and a Flipper gives that too them without the headache of software and the bulk of a full PortaPack. (I love my HackRF and PortaPack for the record. The Flipper can't complete with the features and low-level access when you need it) [0] https://hackaday.com/2015/06/08/hacking-the-im-me-to-open-ga... reply geor9e 9 hours agoprev$169 is a bit steep for me, so I went on Temu and bought a $8 125KHz RFID programmer & a $5 USB-C IR Blaster. Combined with my Samsung phones native NFC writing, bluetooth, etc I feel like it scratched the itch of 90% of what people do with Flipper for 10% the cost. reply spookie 8 hours agoparentThe point of the flipper zero is to have one good supported gadget that has a lot of people hacking away with it. It's the same thing with the raspberry pi, sure you can get some cheap clone off less than ideal places, but you're gonna pay with your time. That's basically it. reply jefftk 6 hours agorootparent> It's the same thing with the raspberry pi, sure you can get some cheap clone... It's a little different: from when the rPI first came out the price was a big driver of it's popularity. It started with the Model B at $35 (with the Model A at $25 \"later this year\") and this was so much cheaper than other options at the time. Look over threads from the time [1][2] and you'll see things like: \"I teach middle school programming/computer classes. I cannot wait to get my hands on one of these. Right now it's cheap enough that I can tell the parents to buy one for their kids without a problem, and out of pocket it for those few of my students whose parents won't be able to afford it.\" and \"The pricepoint is simply revoultionary.

(Do some research to find a good seller as I have heard some sellers ship bad units). It can do both 125khz and 13.25Mhz RFID/NFC and is easier to use then some of the Android apps for cracking Mifare keys. For the price, it is great for more complex attacks and almost has all the features of a full Proxmark RDV4 (minus BLE and a battery).

I have some tokens for opening my garage door that I'd like to clone, and I'd like to know how they work. reply tkems 3 hours agorootparentI would check out the Proxmark3 Github repo [0]. They have a cheatsheet [1] with the basics on how to get started. I also did a talk about RFID security last year about the basics [2] To get started, the basics are: low freq (LF) is usually around 125khz and is rarely encrypted (HID Prox is the most common in the US). The data is often encoded in Wiegand format for access control systems (something to keep in mind when reading the raw data). High freq (HF) (aka NFC) is ~13Mhz and is readable by most Android phones with NFC. Not all tag data can be read however. HF cards support a lot of different options including data storage (normally in a block layout with permissions to read and write depending on keys) and encryption (iCLASS and SEOS being the HID offerings and very common). Some can be cloned (like hotel cards) while others (like SEOS) require a downgrade attack to work correctly (SEOS -> normal SEOS reader -> Weigand data -> older style card like HID Prox).

It's not really intended to be used as a general purpose computer, it's more like a really extensible radio reply lolinder 8 hours agorootparentYeah, but for me (and I imagine a lot of people on here) the itch that Flipper Zero teases is that of a hackable computer in a neat form factor, not the specific radio capabilities that it's actually meant for. I didn't know about M5 before and now I'm hooked exploring M5's store, so I appreciate OP's pointing me there! reply s17n 7 hours agorootparentI think there are a lot of better options if that's what you want. From what I've seen the appeal of the Flipper is that you can do a bunch of fun stuff with a super easy to use interface (just select the thing you want to do and press go!) It's like the iPod of radio/rfid hacking. reply lolinder 7 hours agorootparentYeah, for sure—I looked at the Flipper when it first came out and decided it was overkill for me. reply grishka 7 hours agorootparentprevAlso the 1-wire/iButton capabilities.

I thought the Flipper zero won't provide that functionality unless you flash the firmware. reply filoleg 4 hours agorootparentNot the person you are replying to, but I use my flipper for the exact same purpose. Not sure which specific garage opener my apartment building has. But the fob controller the leasing office gave out is way too weak, so i have to sometimes press it many many times and wiggle it in multiple ways until it triggers the garage door. With flipper, it works on the first try. A funny anecdote: after using my flipper for about a year, I encountered another flipper user in my apartment elevator (the elevator requires a keyfob to go to any floor except the ground floor). I talked to him for a bit. Turns out, he manages a bunch of boat storage units here (in Seattle) that all use different keyfobs. So for him, it is just pure convenience to carry a single flipper device as opposed to always having a lot of different physical keyfobs on him, and then shuffling through them in his bag to get the right one. reply Eji1700 7 hours agorootparentprevThe part I don't get is even if you flash the firmware, does that mean you can make sure it doesn't make all other remotes fail?

When you press the button, remote increments its sequence number and send this number, its ID and a hash of all that and the seed to the controller. Controller checks the hash, then checks that seq number is more than last seen for this remote and opens the door.

It's been a fun journey that's rapidly advanced my understanding of quite a few things. Others have said its overpriced or that you can build your own or whatever, but it's actually just the right price for a cool little educational tool that also works beyond the educational stage. It may even inspire me to build my own advanced version at some point. If you're already a hardware hacker or EE, this is probably not much more than a toy for you.

It also helped me learn that my parents' garage door is pretty secure. I'm able to have the opener learn my flipper like any other remote, but not crack it. This is even with the unleashed firmware that doesn't mind violating FCC regulations (some of the frequencies it hops to are restricted). I was able to copy my work NFC badge, but I'm not really interested in trying it out. It's handy as a pocket spectrum sniffer, but I don't have much day-to-day use for it outside of that. I'm glad it was given to me because I learned a lot. Potential future use for me might be an amiibo emulator, but I've grown out of those sorts of things. reply spike021 8 hours agorootparentMy apartment uses Latch deadlocks.

My guess is that the receiver looks not only for next code after the last one used, but also for several codes after that. Question: how many times would you have to press the button on the remote for it to get so far ahead of what the receiver looks for that the remote no longer works without reprogramming the receiver? reply ec109685 7 hours agorootparentThere’s a great answer here that describes a rolling code attack and above it, an answer describing that they have slack regarding where they are in the code sequence. https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/47440 reply epcoa 8 hours agorootparentprevMore like most garage doors sold in the last 20 years have a rolling code system, a few of which are non trivial to deal with.

Only thing I used it for was scanning my dogs microchip reply notatoad 6 hours agoprevthis seems like a cool device that people actually like, but it's crazy that i've still never seen a blog post of \"hey check out this cool thing i did\" that just happens to use a flipper. it's always the other way around, the point is to have a flipper and find things to do with it, not to have a flipper because it does something you want. i buy lots of nerdy toys, but can we all just admit that this is a toy, not a tool? reply vivak6223 1 hour agoprevMj reply system2 9 hours agoprevHard to justify the cost. I see the ads everywhere for this device. If you have this product please review it for everyone. reply smcleod 7 hours agoprev$310 AUD... that's insane! reply yakshaving_jgt 1 hour agoprevMy Flipper Zero has been useful for me while living in Ukraine. For some reason, many apartment buildings require the use of a little electronic tag not only to open the outside gates, but also to operate the elevator to reach someone's apartment. This also includes trying to use the elevator to reach the ground floor, e.g., when you leave your friend's apartment and you are going home. So you can't leave the building with the elevator without your friend coming out and unlocking it for you. It's madness. So, I clone my friends' tags (with their knowledge) and come and go as I please. reply lvl102 9 hours agoprev [5 more] [flagged] ipsin 9 hours agoparent [–] Yeah, I had the same thought. $169?! I get that it's specialty geekware, but with enough popularity that I would have guessed the price would be in line with the Arduino. Like, $50? reply bsder 9 hours agorootparent [–] $169 implies a BOM cost of about $60. That seems ... about right actually? reply ipsin 7 hours agorootparent [–] What fills out that $60 BOM? Obviously the stylish case isn't cheap, but I'm wondering what else makes it expensive. reply bsder 6 hours agorootparent [–] Main microcontroller is $6--that's 10%. NFC micro is going to be a dollar or two. Case. PCBs. Display. Connectors. Voltage regulators. Crystals. Inductors. Speaker. You don't need very many of these to be a chunk of a dollar in order to hit $60 pretty quick. Everybody disregards semiconductor costs when they are under $1. Cheap doesn't mean free though. BOM costs add up really quickly. The necessity to control costs is one of the reasons why software people get so absolutely shocked and dismayed when they try to build hardware. Full schematics and BOMs are here: https://docs.flipper.net/development/hardware/schematic/ The BOMs have some wonkiness and errors, but they're in the right range. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

NASA regains contact with mini-helicopter on Mars NASA's tiny Ingenuity helicopter is seen sitting on the surface of Mars in a photograph taken by the rover Perseverance.×close NASA's tiny Ingenuity helicopter is seen sitting on the surface of Mars in a photograph taken by the rover Perseverance.NASA has re-established contact with its tiny helicopter on Mars, the US space agency said Saturday, after an unexpected outage prompted fears that the hard-working craft had finally met its end.Ingenuity, a drone about 1.6 feet (0.5 meters) tall, arrived on Mars in 2021 aboard the rover Perseverance and became the first motorized craft to fly autonomously on another planet. Data from the helicopter are transmitted via Perseverance back to Earth, but communications were suddenly lost during a test flight on Thursday, Ingenuity's 72nd lift-off on Mars. \"Good news today,\" NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, late Saturday. The agency said that contact had finally been made with the helicopter by commanding Perseverance to \"perform long-duration listening sessions for Ingenuity's signal.\" \"The team is reviewing the new data to better understand the unexpected comms dropout during Flight 72,\" it added. NASA previously said that Ingenuity had attained an altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) on Flight 72, which was a \"quick pop-up vertical flight to check out the helicopter's systems, following an unplanned early landing during its previous flight.\" But during its descent, \"communications between the helicopter and rover terminated early, prior to touchdown,\" the agency said. JPL had noted on Friday that Perseverance was temporarily \"out of line-of-sight with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection.\" In a response to a post on X asking if Ingenuity would be able to fly again, JPL said Saturday that \"the team needs to assess the new data before that can be determined.\" NASA has lost contact with the helicopter before, including for an agonizing two months last year. The mini rotorcraft, which weighs just four pounds (1.8 kilograms), has far exceeded its original goal of undertaking five flights over 30 days on the red planet. In all, it has covered just over 10 miles (17 kilometers) and reached altitudes of up to 79 feet (24 meters). Its longevity has proved remarkable, particularly considering that it must survive glacially cold Martian nights, kept warm by the solar panels that recharge its batteries during daylight hours. Working with Perseverance, it has acted as an aerial scout to assist its wheeled companion in searching for possible signs of ancient microbial life.© 2024 AFP Feedback to editors Related NASA's Mars helicopter 'phones home' after no contact for 63 daysJun 30, 2023NASA's Mars helicopter's third flight goes farther, faster than beforeApr 25, 2021How NASA keeps Ingenuity going after more than 50 flightsNov 24, 2023NASA's Ingenuity Mars helicopter flies again after unscheduled landingAug 8, 2023NASA's Mars copter flight could happen as soon as MondayApr 18, 2021Fourth flight postponed for Mars Ingenuity helicopterApr 29, 2021 Recommended Mars Express finds evidence of large water deposit at the Medusae Fossae FormationJan 19, 2024Simulations show that exoplanets heated at deeper depths by their host stars display markedly different weather patternsJan 18, 2024 featureMoon rocks with unique dust foundJan 18, 2024Searching for dark matter in gaps between starsJan 17, 2024TESS discovers nine new 'hot Jupiters'Jan 17, 2024 reportTwins or cousins?

Most launchpad air conditioning systems, for instance, cost nearly half a million dollars, but SpaceX execs wondered why it cost so much more to cool an area the size of a conference room than the $75,000 it cost to cool their entire headquarters and manufacturing plant.

Considering the reliability of Falcon 9. reply robocat 6 hours agorootparentprevThat depends on the validation and QC of their internal engineering. It is just as terrifying to spend USD120000 on a part that might be no better that what you can design&build in-house. Here's the background: There were numerous ways in which SpaceX's strategies diverged from space industry norms, and almost all of them had direct implications for the cost of its launch systems. First, whereas most aerospace companies give their designs to myriad third-party contractors who create the hardware for them, SpaceX produced roughly 80% of its launch hardware inhouse. SpaceX builds its own motherboards and circuits, vibration sensors, radios and more. In most industries vertical integration increases the costs of firms by not enabling them to benefit from competitive bidding between efficient suppliers. In the aerospace industry, however, the entrenchment of norms around using parts specialized for the space industry (\"space grade\"), and the bureaucratic rules defined by government contractors, had kept supply costs high — very high. SpaceX decided instead to build many of its own parts, or to buy parts not considered \"space grade\" and modify them to achieve \"space grade\".For example, rather than paying $50,000 to $100,000 for an industrial-grade radio, SpaceX was able to build its own for $5,000, and shaved 20% of the weight off at the same time. SpaceX's willingness to produce their own parts came as a shock to suppliers. For example,Tom Mueller recounts a time when he asked a vendor for an estimate on a particular engine valve: \"They came back [requesting] like a year and a half in development and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Just way out of whack. And we're like, 'No, we need it by this summer, for much, much less money.' They go, 'Good luck with that,' and kind of smirked and left.\" Mueller's team created the valve themselves, and by summer they had qualified it for use with cryogenic propellants. \"That vendor, they iced us for a couple of months,\" Mueller said, \"and then they called us back: 'Hey, we're willing to do that valve. You guys want to talk about it?' And we're like, 'No, we're done.' He goes, 'What do you mean you're done?' 'We qualified it. We're done.' And there was just silence at the end of the line. They were in shock.\" As noted, a big factor driving savings at SpaceX is that it often builds its components out of readily available consumer electronics rather than equipment alreadydeemed \"space grade\" by the rest of the industry. Twenty years ago \"space grade\" equipment would have had far superior performance characteristics compared to consumer electronics, but today that is no longer the case-standard electronics can now compete with more expensive, specialized gear. For example, at one point SpaceX needed an actuator that would steer the second stage of the Falcon 1. The job fell to engineer Steve Davis to find the important part, and since he had never built a part like that before he sought out suppliers who could make it for them. Their quoted price for the device was $120,000. As Davis recalls, \"Elon laughed. He said, 'That part is no more complicated than a garage door opener. Your budget is five thousand dollars. Go make it work.'\"20 Davis ended up designing an actuator that cost $3,900. Another example is provided by the computers that provide avionics for a rocket. Traditionally NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory bought expensive, specially toughened computers that cost over $10 million each to operate its rockets. Musk told engineer Kevin Watson that he wanted the bulk of the computer systems for Falcon 1 and Dragon to cost no more than $10,000. Watson was floored,noting, \"In traditional aerospace, it would cost you more than ten thousand dollars just for the food at a meeting to discuss the cost of the avionics.\"21 Watson was inspired by the challenge, however, and ended up creating a fully redundant avionics platform that used a mix of off-the-shelf computer parts and in-house components for just over $10,000. That same system was then also adapted for use in the Falcon 9. About the actuator: Steve Davis, the twenty second hire of SpaceX, needed an actuator that would trigger the gimbal action used to steer the upper stage of Falcon1. He went to find some suppliers and got a quote a $120,000. “Elon laughed”. Davis said. “He said, ‘That part is no more complicated than a garage door opener. Your budget is five thousand dollars. Go make it work.’” Davis spent nine months building the actuator and the final actuator approved by Musk ended up costing $3900. Seems like they don't include the engineering time in the part cost calculations - so cheating a bit! I've experienced building something in-house that is far better than what you could otherwise get. Back in the 00's I wrote a JavaScript framework because the existing ones were all crappy in a variety of ways. Even as a one-person effort (and I'm no 10x engineer) I could write something that was wayyy better in a bunch of important ways (albeit not pretty enough design). My work was engineered better than the open source and commercial frameworks that I evaluated/used. Better loading, better recovery from network and other errors, better memory behaviour, better size, better speed, better integration, better diagnostics, better browser support, better user interface, customised for our needs. It did exactly what we needed for our project and mostly worked flawlessly. reply wolverine876 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm sure Musk's biography says lots of things. Do you still take it a face value? reply artemonster 16 hours agoparentprevYes, it did. I like the sentiment but I wonder how much conflict of interest would undermine this idea. Imagine how many companies are involved in developing space grade one-off hardware! Also, why would a highly bureaucratic structure undercut the amount of money that they themselves are asking for (and receiving) out of a budget? Savings are not aligned with the interest of such structure. Its not that for the amount you have saved you can allocate rest of the funds for something else (usually this is how it works with publicly funded projects AFAIK) reply icegreentea2 14 hours agorootparentEvery bit of money and platform resources (rad hardened CPUs are giant, slow and power inefficient compared to even semi modern COTS) is money and resources that NASA can spend on scientific payload on the same platform. NASA absolutely does have some incentive to find savings in control hardware and software. Finally, while Ingenuity does use a non-hardened Snapdragon, many other of its critical electronics components are still rad-hardened. The FPGA and dual MCUs (that actually do the low level control and I/O I assume) are both rad hardened. In addition, the COTS components that were used where screened by NASA for their performance in radiation. The Snapdragon is really just there to control the radio, and do image processing. Critically, these are functions that have -some leeway- for timing, giving the option to just restart the Snapdragon if a watch dog detects a problem. All of this to say is that rad-hardening isn't going away, but will probably stick around in many critical niches. What Ingenuity absolutely do is validate that modern COTS processors have a role to play in radiation elevated environments, including in semi-critical applications. reply sho_hn 12 hours agorootparentThis is a great and informative comment! HN is dominantly a web/SW crowd plus some mobile frontend, and \"it uses a Snapdragon\" gives many a wrong idea. In embedded device projects a lot of time is spent planning and designing around a heavy compute element running Linux like this, especially if the device has a safety concept or other mixed criticality concerns. It will have a substantial moat around it. On HN if you say \"systems architecture\" most folks go \"Oh you mean like, whether we use microservices?\". In embedded, while there is a lot of overlap and analogues, it's also all of the above, plus power state management and other aspects.

The conversion of kilograms, mass, to pound-force, weight, relies explicitly on the given acceleration of Earth's gravity, ~9.8 m/s². Since Mars has a gravity with acceleration ~3.7 m/s², for two things that weight the same on Earth and Mars the latter would need to be larger in mass to weigh the same in pound-force. The biggest issue though, and something I will say even having been through multiple physics courses myself I don't recall having had literally explained, is that even though \"pounds\" can refer to force and not mass, they are not equivalent. 1 pound-mass ≠ 1 pound-force. It is actually converted using the Earth's standard gravitional field's force, so 1 pound-mass ≈ 9.8 pound-force. Thus, the amount on bench's is the pound-mass amount, say 66 kg or 145 pounds-mass, which is not 145 pounds-force but actually *1421*. It's also true even that the gravitional force can change up to as much as 0.5% depending on where on Earth you are due to the shape of the Planet. While the joke made _me_ laugh, but it seems as you dig further there isn't often reference to pounds as a force as much as I had thought, so I even learned something from it too! Lots more information on Wikipedia[0] around these that is particularly useful if you for any reason want to know more: 0: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(force) reply HPsquared 7 hours agorootparentIt's still 145 lbf and 145 lb mass. Under Earth's gravity the numbers are identical. (That is, a mass of 1 lb has a weight of 1 lbf). The 10x difference comes in with metric units (kg and N). Edit: might as well mention the rocketry connection... Probably the most well-known use of pounds-force is when discussing thrust of rocket engines (and other means of jet propulsion). reply anonomousename 9 hours agorootparentprevExcellent explanation!

NASA has a habit of underestimating lifespans by a comical amount. It will be like \"we expected the rover to operate for 10 weeks and that was 6 years ago\". I think the most extreme example is Voyager 1, which was on a 5-year mission that reached nearly 50 years. reply jacoblambda 10 hours agoparentThey planned for three 90 second flights prior to launch. After those worked they transitioned over to longer \"operations demo\" flights and those were extended tentatively out to 12 flights. After the 21st flight they just stopped manually allocating labor and funding to the project for a set number of flights and instead gave them a running budget for indefinite continued operations. So while \"strictly speaking\" they planned for three 90 second flights. There was the unstated assumption that it'd be used for much more than that as long as it actually worked effectively. reply foobar1962 8 hours agorootparentIt sounds as though mission life has as much to do with funding for ground staff (not something I ever considered) at least as much as it has to do with the life expectancy of deployed hardware. reply russtrotter 8 hours agoparentprevI always feel like NASA has mastered the basic \"under promise, over deliver\" philosophy that keeps the lights on and the next missions funded.

For the solar farm assembly case, It's actually a lot easier to have a teleoperated robot doing the work, a few astronauts in orbit doing the operation / construction. In the case of building things, you want as much space / weight landed to be the thing being built, not the builders, per se. reply wongarsu 18 hours agoparentprevIngenuity was just a technology demonstrator. I think it demonstrated the technology splendidly, so we are likely to see more helicopters on Mars in the future. Not sure if Nasa has said yet which roles they see for future Mars helicopters. The initial idea behind Ingenuity was to use them as scouting vehicles for rovers. Of course rovers improved a lot too, with better autonomous driving. But with a Mars rover driving about 100 meters/yards per day scouting helicopters are still useful. Maybe we will also see Helicopters carrying more instruments themselves. But I imagine in the beginning that's mostly better imaging instruments. Weight is still an issue for flying things, no matter the planet. But maybe we will see some future missions that instead of a car-sized rover and one tiny helicopter have a fleet of helicopters with a small support-rover for exploring wider areas. reply wyldfire 18 hours agoparentprevThe existing helicopter is extremely small and light, IIRC. less than one kg. So it definitely won't be picking up a 900kg rover, even if you tried to scale it up somehow. The atmosphere is just too thin to support anything but a minimal payload. But yeah having more helicopters might be feasible - for surveying the surface. reply Firaxus 17 hours agorootparentI was surprised to learn that it’s actually a fair bit heavier. I was lucky enough to get to attend a talk by the head of the Ingenuity program, and he mentioned how the mass ballooned a bit to something under 5 pounds. (Listed as 4 pounds on this official fact sheet) https://mars.nasa.gov/files/mars2020/MarsHelicopterIngenuity... reply mmbop 18 hours agorootparentprevIs there a problem of scaling this up to say a 20kg payload? I’m not an aeronautical engineer, so I guess what I’m asking is if there is some problem scaling up flying machines in an extremely thin atmosphere? reply wongarsu 17 hours agorootparentOne issue might be rotor span. Ingenuity has pretty big rotors to counter the thin atmosphere (about 4 feet top-to-tip). On earth rotor sizes are limited by the speed at the wing-tip. Once you make the rotor too long the tips start approaching supersonic speeds, giving you all kinds of weird mach effects. To make matters worse, the speed of sound is about 30% lower on Mars compared to near earth's surface. reply jessriedel 17 hours agorootparentYea good point. Apparently the blade tip speed on Ingenuity is Mach 0.6-0.7! reply skovati 16 hours agorootparentInteresting note about this: the speed of sound on Mars is only ~70% of that on Earth, due to less atmospheric density. Might change your Mach numbers! reply Metacelsus 16 hours agorootparentIt's not due to less density, but rather a different gas composition (CO2 vs. N2+O2). reply algas 14 hours agorootparentLet's run the numbers! The speed of sound in an ideal (calorically perfect) gas is given by a = sqrt( gamma * R * T ) where gamma is the ratio of specific heats (thermodynamic property of a gas, which may vary with temperature), R is the individual gas constant, and T the temperature of the fluid. All of these are going to be different on Mars versus on Earth: Earth: R = R_atm = 287 J / (kg * K) gamma = 1.44 T = 293 K (taking room temperature as an average temperature) Mars: R = R_CO2 = 188 J / (kg * K) gamma = 1.37 T = 210 K (from a quick google, about -60 deg C) If the Martian and Earth atmospheres were at the same temperature, then the speed of sound on Mars would be 80% that of the speed of sound on Earth. Given the temperature difference, the speeds of sound are a_mars = 232 m/s a_earth = 347 m/s So yes, much of the difference is due to the composition: the Martian atmosphere has a higher atomic weight, which leads to a lower individual gas constant, and decreases the speed of sound. However, a substantial amount of the difference is simply due to the different temperatures on the surfaces of the two planets. reply jessriedel 15 hours agorootparentprevI included it reply mmbop 17 hours agorootparentprevOh interesting! I can see how that would be a harder problem (although not insurmountable since some planes on earth have supersonic propellers). Just a quick edit - wow, u didn’t realize the span was already 4ft! Anything much larger could definitely be hard to pack inside a fairing! reply AlexAndScripts 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat about multiple smaller rotors? Or would that cause weird turbulence effects? Could we use some kind of jet engine? reply jvanderbot 17 hours agorootparentprevHere's a paper that describes what the next gen could/should be.

Withrow-Maser Ames and JPL were still collaborating on this when I worked there. reply jessriedel 17 hours agorootparentprevI don't know the answer to your question, but for context here are the weights of Mars rovers: Sojourner (1997): 11 kg Spirit & Opportunity (2004): 185 kg Curiosity (2011): 899 kg Perseverance (2020): 1,025 kg reply mmbop 17 hours agorootparentI know these are much larger - I’m just really curious about the dynamics of scaling up rotorcraft & why it is problematic. ie - do rotor physics become impracticality large or fast at some point for materials science, or is it purely a space problem for rocket launches. reply jessriedel 17 hours agorootparentOh for sure, it's a great question. reply IamTC 8 hours agorootparentprevI have led efforts building Chinook style tandem rotors with 2 sets of blades from a size like the Trex 800, powered by a 2 stroke engine, as well as 40kg max takeoff quad-planes with both electric quadrotor and 2 stroke engine (for forward motion). But because I was the main lead and pushing the pace so fast, I wished I did it with a more rigorous aero-engineering to it. I started both projects with barely any experience developing aircraft. Thinking about your question, here are my 2 cents: The biggest thing I stugged with is how the vibrations and the accompanying harmonics on the sytem as the rotors spin up and down. I could see it on the logs as the rotors spin through certain Hz, there's would spikes in virbational ampiltudes at predictable frequencies. As the blades get bigger the forces (probably) goes up. Sometimes, these frequecies (especially the lower ones) are at the range where its very hard to find the right materials to damp it out of the control and sensing electronics. Ingenuity probably deals with a virbration range that well into the hundreds/thousand of Hz and I do remember that renge is not a difficult range to damp out, vis a vis the low tens of hertz. Also, the harmonics is related to ground resonance. I had built my tandem with \"skids\" that are rigidly attached to the rest of the frame. When the system made contact with the ground on just one skid, that one skid becomes a pivot, the vibration has no where to go and I witnessed first hand, first time, what ground resonance can do to mechanical systems. I can never forget seeing M4 through to M8 hex holt beads being sheared clean off after the resonance event. Only later did I find out that in full scale systems, they have dampeners between the main body and the skids of the aircraft. See https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IIC-oBzLYhQ ; Staying in flight is not as hard. But getting the ssytem to land and spin down proerly was big pain without understanding ground resonance and its effect on mechanical design. When I saw the little puny legs of Ingenuity, this experience of mine came into mind and I was glad they had legs like to damp out vibrations as it came down to land. Then there is the relation between the mechanical vibration regimes of the system, the polilng rates of the foundational flight sensors and the freqency of the main flight stability and movement control loop itself. With bigger systems, the cables (for signal and power) could run longer too (becoming long long antennas), which means you can run into problems with noise of various origins. If I'd do it again, something like CAN bus would probably be something I look at seriously. Bigger systems also draws more power, and that can have an impact on how much management is needed for noise. Bigger power draw usually also means heavy power store & delivery system, which affects CG management, when then means you can't move things around to management noise. At some point, I felt like I was doing dancing a multi-factorial show. I wished I could be clearer. Perhaps someone more qualified can chime in. reply todd8 16 hours agorootparentprevThese must be the masses of the Mars rovers, the weights would be measured in newtons (or pounds in the USA) and would differ between mars and earth. reply nortlov 17 hours agorootparentprevIn a thin atmosphere, lifting a heavier payload needs bigger rotors or increased RPM, which increases power demands and structural stress. The challenge is to keep the vehicle light enough to fly while also making it sturdy enough to carry the payload and survive environments. reply D13Fd 16 hours agorootparentWhy can’t “more rotors” be another solution? reply nortlov 15 hours agorootparentFor sure, that’s another way to decompose “bigger rotors”. It would probably be appropriate to dive into a conversation about Ingenuity’s design goals, requirements, and the trades performed to end up with what they got. reply swells34 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is what I'm thinking too. A number of posts above talked about physical limits based on speed of sound and rotor length. Cool, so add two rotors, or four. reply mmbop 17 hours agorootparentprevOk - this makes sense to me. Also taken into account the context that anything going to space needs to be light at this point in time. Hopefully we don’t have that restriction forever :) reply Robotbeat 17 hours agorootparentprevIt scales up to 20kg, yes. reply jessriedel 17 hours agoparentprevI think the current plan is that helicopters will be very light with minimal instrumentation and will be used mostly to scout ahead for rovers. The rovers will be much heavier and include many instruments. (Of course, all of NASA's long-term plans for Mars would be completely disrupted if Starship lowers the cost-per-kg of delivering equipment by two orders of magnitude, which arguably is likely.) reply kibwen 17 hours agorootparentMaking it more economical to escape Earth's gravity well isn't going to alter the physics of the Martian atmosphere or the relative utility of copters vs rovers for Martian exploration. Which is to say, even if you stationed humans on Mars, they'd still be exploring remotely via copter/rover pairs, just no longer with a human-to-robot latency measured in tens of minutes. reply wongarsu 16 hours agorootparentHowever we might be willing to drive a lot more agressively if we know we can get a mechanic out to a stuck rover. Similarly, cheaper delivery might make a large number of smaller more disposable vehicles more appealing for many missions, just like what happened to satellites in the last decade. reply jessriedel 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you increase the mass and/or number of vehicles by 100x, a bajillion things will change. reply jvanderbot 17 hours agoparentprevA heli that can move a rover is basically worse than a heli that has rover instruments and a few wheels. You have extra weight and parts and complexity for hitching and carrying that you can just avoid by giving a small rover flying ability. Even the combo is probably too much complexity. A heli with good imagers, spectrometers, and the ability to cart soil samples would be fantastic. reply surfpel 18 hours agoparentprevThat's the goal, yes. Depending on the destination, naturally. Here's what's planned for Titan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(spacecraft) reply jvanderbot 17 hours agorootparentWas going to post this. Titan is such a wonderful place for a nuclear powered helicopter. Much better than rover/submarines/floaters, IMHO.

And Mars' atmosphere is so thin that these rovers will never be moving any meaningful payload, so their only real use case is as a scouting type system. But they also add very little value there given the existence of orbiting satellites.

Nettby had no HTTPS, so I did an ARP poisoning MITM and stole everybody's passwords.

But ARP is how computers figure out what IP address is associated with a hardware / ethernet address, so they know what ethernet address to use for sending packets to a specific IP. ARP poisoning means you flood the network with fake ARP packets saying your ethernet address has the gateway IP or whatever IP. So then the other devices will forward packets to your machine instead of the intended destination. As nettby didn't use HTTPS it would then be trivial to capture / read the packets and figure out everyones' passwords. I.e. the messages would be plain text, unencrypted. Not exactly Eli5, but hope it helps. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 10 hours agorootparentThis is pretty much the reply I'd write, so I'll just add my endorsement. Couple more tidbits of information: Nettby was a Norwegian Myspace clone and it was all the rage back when I was in middle school(around 2007-2009 or thereabouts). ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. ARP has no security built in by default. This combined with the plaintext passwords made the attack trivial. reply coolThingsFirst 9 hours agorootparentprevYes but isnt this possible only on LANs? reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 9 hours agorootparentCorrect. I did this at school. It was early days of students being allowed laptops in class. We weren't actually allowed internet, but the school had an extremely basic wifi network that was WEP encrypted... So naturally I broke out Aircrack-ng and ameliorated that situation. And suddenly everyone was procrastinating on nettby in class. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 10 hours agorootparentprevIt should also be said that HTTPS was seldom used outside of especially sensitive applications until ~2010 when someone packaged a HTTP MITM attack up into a handy Firefox extension. I think that Facebook used HTTPS for the actual login credential exchange, snd then bounced back to HTTP, which meant that the session cookie/s were still MITMable. It’s insane how long it took to see widespread HTTPS adoption. reply roughly 10 hours agorootparentYes! Firesheep was the extension, and I think the combination of that and LetsEncrypt (which was in part a reaction to Firesheep) were the reason the web went from almost entirely decrypted by default to almost entirely encrypted by default in a matter of months. The capabilities had been there for years, but Firesheep made session hijacking a literal one-click affair and vividly highlighted the danger of unencrypted web traffic - it’s maybe the most impactful bit of white-hat hackery of all time. reply nijave 8 hours agorootparentprevIirc Google said they'd start penalizing non https sites in search results and browser makers added much more aggressive warnings to http pages.

But the door was wide open for anything. reply civilized 19 hours agoprevI expect this will attract a lot of criticism, but I actually think it's a good idea, at least in some cases. There are a lot of people writing bad code and bad system architectures for their organizations. There are not enough people with the competence, organizational power, and time to catch what's bad and force change in those organizations. In the US you are probably forced to do business via many such terribly coded websites, e.g. your local healthcare provider. In such cases, it might be better if we assumed the implementation might be as awful as it commonly is, and recommended mitigations based on that. It's also easy for people to test if the website actually allows the nominally prohibited password patterns and complain to some oversight authority if so. Whereas it's not so easy to test, from the outside, whether it's really been done the right way. It's inelegant and tragic, but in the end it might be a good idea to accept that things are often done poorly and without adequate oversight, and consider what mitigations can prevent the worst outcomes in these cases. reply jchw 18 hours agoparentI disagree. It may seem good on paper, but it gives you too much of a false sense of security. Security measures like this often seem to work, but they are papering over a deeper problem. Usually this is being done because user input is not being handled carefully, and if so, the assumption that blocking some keywords \"defangs\" potential exploits is usually easy to prove false. Consider the case of eBay and JSFuck[1]. I dislike the mentality that leads to this; WAFs, lazy pentesting and compliance checkboxes have created a substantial body of absolute bullshit security theater and I have absolutely zero doubt that this has convinced companies it's \"safe\" to put insanely poorly written software partially out on the open internet and that they've \"done their due diligence\" so to speak. And then I get a letter in the mail apologizing that my most confidential information has yet again been leaked by some company I barely or didn't have any real choice to give my data to. I'm sure they all care deeply about my data and that's why it was stolen using decades-old Java serialization library vulnerabilities. [1]: https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/ebay-platform-exposed-t... reply civilized 15 hours agorootparentA lot of critical responses here are saying \"this distracts from getting people to do the right thing\". I'm open to that, but what is the plan for forcing organizations that are doing the wrong thing to do the right thing? We're talking about businesses that mismanage the sensitive data of millions of people. \"They should be doing things right\" doesn't seem like an adequate response to this situation. reply jchw 14 hours agorootparentCorrect, we should be legally enforcing that they do the right thing, with legislation that has actual fangs, for companies like Equifax. It should be a potential bankruptcy event when you leak most of America's social security numbers through sheer incompetence. The problem is that WAF-style security-theater is being enshrined as the industry standard instead, which means that we're just going to get more of these problems instead of less. In other words, a half-measure like this doesn't just distract from doing the right thing, it's actually literally useless for any real security, and instead it's more likely to allow serious security issues to go unnoticed for a much longer period of time. reply jstarfish 10 hours agorootparent> legislation that has actual fangs, for companies like Equifax. It should be a potential bankruptcy event when you leak most of America's social security numbers Immutable identifiers should never have this much weight. When your encryption key is compromised, you roll it. When your SSN is leaked, you're doing damage control for the rest of your life. This problem did not begin with Equifax. It's a 7-digit number that encoded most people's birth region in it until two decades ago and gets asked for by all sorts of randos having anything to do with finance. The problem here is that something so readily shared and easily compromised and impossible to change has this much weight in our identification protocols. reply bruce511 9 hours agorootparentYou are not wrong, but I'd argue that mutable ID methods would be worse. Ok, context and perspective will matter a lot here. If you are wanting to hide from authority then mutable id sounds good. If you are wanting to \"know the history\" of a person then mutable is bad. In our social contract the \"inability\" to change id is baked into the way be behave, and the consequences for bad behavior. Equally there are lots of good reasons to be able to get a quick history of say a prospective employee, loan recipient, tennant, supplier, customer, and so on. If I can apply for a new Social Security number every month/year then that number does become useless as a form of id. But it would then just need to be replaced with something else. Too much of what we do is predicated on our historical behavior. Having a 12-month limit on identity would break, well, just about any kind of contract. And in most contract situations uou most definitely want to know \"who\" you are contracting with. reply civilized 14 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you about security theater. The only reason I'm favorable to this approach is because it seems to provide accountable harm reduction in this case. It would stop many typical attacks while being very easy for any random government bureaucrat to test compliance with. reply redeeman 8 hours agorootparentprev> I'm open to that, but what is the plan for forcing organizations that are doing the wrong thing to do the right thing? i'd say figure out how bad what they did is.

About the same time as if you purposely published the data, or purposely dropped a table, because thats about what you did.

Which would reflect poorly on any institution, but especially a university (which should be a bastion of people with competence and organizational power). As for common password advise, my take on your argument would be that we should all be using these keywords in our passwords to quickly surface these bugs, lest they be hidden and only used by attackers. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparent> especially a university (which should be a bastion of people with competence and organizational power) Generally the opposite. University staff positions pay pretty poorly compared to what the most competent people can earn elsewhere. There are some bright staff people at universities who are there for other reasons besides the pay, but the competence of an average university staff software developer is not great.

It might mean that auditors forced the installation of a WAF because of $REGULATIONS (irrespective of the actual code quality) and refused to allow weakening the rules for password fields. EDIT: as they don't actually check for all the banned strings, the \"auditor + mandatory misconfigured WAF\" hypothesis expressed above is not valid in this case. But let it stay as an otherwise-plausible explanation, or maybe something that was valid in the past. reply wongarsu 19 hours agorootparentThe WAF hypothesis still holds if you assume the password change page is governed by the same WAF. The WAF would reject any new password it finds offensive, and the \"rule\" about not using certain SQL keywords just matches people's fuzzy understanding of why these passwords are rejected. It was probably even true, a couple WAF rule updates ago. reply oliwarner 19 hours agoparentprevYour password should not go anywhere near a database. It should be salted and hashed a few hundred thousand times and that compared to the salted, hashed version stored on file. If you can't even manage that, you have no business writing software that can store credentials. And I mean that. Software security starts with acknowledging that data is toxic and will bankrupt you if you refuse to respect it. reply cbsmith 13 hours agorootparent>Your password should not go anywhere near a database. > > It should be salted and hashed a few hundred thousand times and that compared to the salted, hashed version stored on file. > > If you can't even manage that, you have no business writing software that can store credentials That's misunderstanding the nature of the vulnerability. It's not about where the password is stored, but where it is entered. Before it can be salted & hashed, there's software that has to decide where the password input starts and ends. If it gets that wrong, that's how you get the vulnerability. It's not even clear that there is a vulnerability problem here, though there is obviously a usability/UI problem. It could very well be that having those words in your password doesn't compromise security anywhere, but some systems might reject the password before even attempting to authenticate with it. reply oliwarner 13 hours agorootparentIt might be a method to avoid trigger an overenthusiastic WAF, but these are all SQL tokens and keywords. It seems far more likely that they've blocked them in a desperate effort to catch injection attacks. There might not be an actual attack vector, they might block these words in all inputs. It just smells like incompetence. reply 8note 7 hours agorootparentprev> but where it is entered. Hmm. This strongly reminds me of gpt promt injection. I guess why they're both called injection attacks reply deathanatos 7 hours agorootparentprev> That's misunderstanding the nature of the vulnerability. No, they're 100% correct. If the password is properly stored, there's no possibility of injection, because what gets sent to the database is something like a hex string, or just a bytestring, depending on reprsentation. > It's not about where the password is stored, but where it is entered. Before it can be salted & hashed, there's software that has to decide where the password input starts and ends. If it gets that wrong, that's how you get the vulnerability. ??? Where it is entered looks like this:… the actual text of the password makes no appearances, ever. Whatever code you're using to generate HTML/DOM nodes, or SQL queries, should be parameterized and automatically escaping all inputs. If it isn't, that's the security issue, and trying to kludge around it with idiotic restrictions won't work. (Other commenters have already alluded to the problems with the OP's attempt.) But even then, a password should never hit either of those interfaces: there's no reason to render it into the DOM, or into SQL. (There are some other comments about this might be to help users work around failures in a WAF. That could be, but it's orthogonal.) reply civilized 19 hours agorootparentprevMany people in positions of great responsibility don't do what they should. What do we do about that? reply oliwarner 18 hours agorootparentI wouldn't be telling anyone to implement crappy password policies as a workaround. I'd tell them to do it properly or not at all, and remind them that in many jurisdictions, knowingly implementing poor data controls earns you some actionable liability. PII is no joke. This isn't controversial when you're telling people you can't do your own gas work without certification, or electrics without experience. It's okay to demand competence. reply civilized 18 hours agorootparentWhat you're recommending is the status quo.

SQL parameterisation, transport encryption, input validation (and more) are all as important. Stopping SQL keywords is a distraction dressed up like security. It's harmful. reply civilized 15 hours agorootparent> Stopping SQL keywords is a distraction dressed up like security. It's harmful. We are talking about how to mitigate harm from people who are already doing the wrong thing. Saying that this distracts from doing the right thing misses the point.

Once again, your proposal is the failing status quo. reply oliwarner 14 hours agorootparentI'm really trying to meet you halfway here but I can't imagine a scenario where I had such low confidence in a third party application that I'd wrap it in input-filtering cotton wool and feel like that was safe enough. A project that both stores plaintext passwords and fails to use parametrisation (something that's been standard practice for over two decades) is untrustable. It's an untenable liability. Maybe I'm wrong. Could you explain when you think this would be acceptable? reply civilized 14 hours agorootparentIt's not that I think it's acceptable. I'm thinking about how to reduce the harm of people doing unacceptable things that we can't stop them from doing. I would be very transparent about this. I would say this is harm reduction for people who are doing the wrong thing and is a waste of everyone else's time, but we have to do it anyway because software engineering has failed to govern itself as a profession and the government has failed to hold it accountable for its disasters. The key thing is that it's both easy to test and would stop many attacks. Anyone can check whether the password field will take these forbidden keywords and patterns. No question it's a pathetic thing to have to resort to, but pathetic is where things are at right now. reply oliwarner 46 minutes agorootparentIf they're storing raw data without parameters, you can't have any confidence they do that with every other SQL query. You'd have to block every SQL token from every input. Imagining we're happy to sacrifice these words to the gods of security theatre, what layer are you suggesting this goes? Browser level just means hackers can make raw requests. HTTPDS could block it, like an overzealous WAF, but that still needs implementing. Service providers shouldn't be able to see this stuff because of transport layer security. There's no sensible way to make this make sense. I do agree that a lot of entities are not adequately prosecuted for their incompetent data handling but fixing that seems far more realistic than banning the word \"drop\", everywhere. reply lmm 11 hours agorootparentprevDoes it really reduce harm?

A lot of engineering effort get threw at the wrong layer, when the problem can be much more efficiently solved on another layer. It renders the whole organization working in fear -- When you have to worry about the system inserting password in plaintext into a database table, there are also a million other terrible things that can go wrong in this system, like what if your DBA copy-paste a SQL from stackoverflow?

Use popular open source frameworks and/or buy a commercial product. reply _heimdall 19 hours agoparentprevWhat is the attack vector this protects against though? If the authentication flow is doing anything other than salting/hashing the password and then throwing away the original plaintext password, the entire system really shouldn't be used at all. reply civilized 19 hours agorootparentIt (partially) protects against the attack vector in which the system was badly coded and simply does not do what everyone with basic competency insists all systems must do.

But if one person thought of it, others may have as well. I was learning to write sqlite C functions for fun, and thought since storing plain passwords has been such an issue, why not offload the responsibility from the programmer and let the db handle it fully -- consume plaintext, salt, hash, etc, and could transparently upgrade algorithms when necessary. Luckily I've learned enough to recognize that my skillset is not of the level necessary to fully evaluate the risks. Today the idea makes me feel uncomfortable. reply paulmd 7 hours agorootparentone general problem with this (and also audit logging) is making sure that such changes can't be rolled back. I think the consensus the last time I looked at it was to do it in a separate connection or batched at the end of the main transaction. but audit logging is just such a tremendous pain in general and everyone's got their own specific requirements. I think in general you would not want to do this in the database anyway (definitely not unless it's sharded and not really even then). You are taking that hashing load off your application servers and moving it inside the DB after all. When your DB is out of CPU, it's out, they're tough to scale. And in SQLite you are holding the DB write lock for longer, which serializes every other thread that needs to write. That's also true of holding connections/resources in traditional DBs. It's notionally fine for toy problems and you can probably do \"clever\" shit like sharding uuids across multiple files by hash to scale a bit further. But increasingly, even as someone who likes the idea of a \"richer\" interface to RDBMS, and doesn't mind writing SQL functions/triggers/views where it makes sense, I think the database really just not is the place for unnecessary gizmos on performance grounds either.

Yeah that would probably work for a while. Until someone proves it doesn't :P It's not really rocket science anymore to make sure user input doesn't mix with your SQL. This is not 2005. And really if this works in the first place you're storing the passwords unhashed which was even a dumb thing in 2005. If the same applies to the username or other user input fields it would make a bit more sense but passwords should never enter the database like that. reply MathMonkeyMan 13 hours agoparentAt work, we were discussing how to serialize some structured data as an HTTP request header value. I reflexively said \"ascii subset of JSON without newlines,\" but that was rejected for some reasons (maybe too much punctuation, verbose for Chinese...). Someone came up with pipe-separated fields, but then that was rejected too. The reason was something like \"some customers used to have proxies that would reject any headers that include a pipe character.\" My point is that voodoo programming isn't always due to lack of due diligence. It's due to knowing that something went wrong with something in the past, but for which there is no evidence, and about which you would be able to do nothing. My preference is to deploy it anyway, see if it breaks, and if necessary work it out with the customer after the fact. That's unpopular for good and obvious reasons, so no pipe characters. reply jrockway 14 hours agoparentprevI think it was early 2005 when I wrote my first database app, and I didn't find it that hard to not mix user data with SQL.

Worse, a stored procedure can potentially be covertly modified to store or exfiltrate the password while hashing it. reply junon 11 hours agorootparentTo be clear, this only improves security if the user reuses passwords. reply junon 19 hours agorootparentprevWell, not in plaintext. reply klyrs 15 hours agorootparentThat's why you hash the password with an SQL built-in hash function. For security! But the password is still in plaintext inside the query so you can retrieve it from the logs for... security? (I joke, but 20 years younger me, self-teaching php and security etc? Who knows what she'd think of this) reply turminal 19 hours agoparentprevThat would imply WAF gets to see unhashed passwords, so not good at all. reply jesprenj 19 hours agorootparentWAF always sees unhashed passwords -- passwords are sent TLS encrypted in a POST body (unhashed) and are hashed by the server software -- and that's regardless of the password policy. reply hiatus 19 hours agorootparentprevHow would a WAF do its job if it can't see the request payload? reply wongarsu 19 hours agorootparentThere are various schemes where the password is salted, hashed or prehashed on the client side, to various effectiveness. They have never been really popular and the advent of ubiquitous https probably made them even less common, but they do exist. They do help protect you from your own WAF though. reply d-z-m 19 hours agorootparentcan you elaborate on this? Or link something that does? My intuition is that whatever gets sent over the wire is effectively the password. Not sure how the server could validate some rolling hash of the password (based on like a timestamp or something) without having to store the pre-image(i.e. the raw password). reply liversage 12 hours agorootparentThe SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System does not send the password from the client to the server. This scheme is supposedly used by Blizzard when authenticating users in some of their online games. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2945 https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18461/how-secur... reply wongarsu 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, that's the common counter argument. Your hash has now just become the password, and no amount of clever salting really solves that. It still prevents the server (and any proxies, MitM attackers, etc) from seeing the plain-text password, which can help protect the user if they reused the password somewhere else. Assuming the client wasn't also compromised, which is very likely in web applications but maybe a valid scenario in apps and desktop applications. The other imho valid idea is that you can run a key derivation function client-side (e.g. salted with the user-name), in addition to running your normal best-practice setup server side. This can allow you to run more expensive key derivation which provides more protection if your database is leaked, while also making dictionary attacks on your authentication endpoints less viable. reply aidenn0 7 hours agorootparentprevIf your password is 123456, then client-side hashing will make this less obvious. If the site is compromised in a way that reveals passwords, then it will not trivially work on other sites that use your password. In addition, stronger total hashing can be used, since if your server can do M hashes persecond and your client can do N hashes per second, the total number of hashes to allow a one second login are (M/$NUMBER_OF_CONCURRENT_LOGINS)+N which is strictly larger than (M/$NUMBER_OF_CONCURRENT_LOGINS). SRP[1] is an even better improvement, where an eavesdropper cannot authenticate as you; there is a challenge-response to login. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protoco... reply wkat4242 14 hours agorootparentprevThese are SQL commands.

They still force people to include those characters, and the 'maximum' password length is like 20, sometimes 12. reply cco 12 hours agoprevI work at an auth company (Stytch) and sometimes developers ask me about input restrictions on passwords in our API. I've had folks ask me if we support emoji, \"code/SQL\" like in this example, Chinese characters etc. So fun to see and hear from folks on all sorts of stacks, especially legacy systems where layers of cruft have accreted over time to produce Byzantine requirements like this. reply kazinator 19 hours agoprevAll five words are also common English words found in any major dictionary. If you're not actually doing anything stupid with the passwords, all you have to do is use that same diagnostic for that situation: \"password may not contain dictionary words\". Then you don't have a diagnostic which raises red flags. That the developer is not aware that their diagnostic raises a red flag itself raises a red flag. It doesn't occur to them that a system which issues this diagnostic will be suspected of doing stupid things. That tends to betray a lack of sophistication in the area of security. reply ylyn 19 hours agoparentThat's not a reasonable requirement at all. A common recommendation nowadays is to have passphrases.. reply kazinator 16 hours agorootparentYou're right; if the pass phrase has twenty random words, some of which are select or insert, then that's a bad diagnostic. reply nephanth 16 hours agoparentprevExcept this restriction effectively bans xkcd passes (4 random dictionary words) reply Syzygies 14 hours agoprevA legendary xkcd: \"Did you really name your son Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;-- ? https://xkcd.com/327/ reply danesparza 13 hours agoparentAwww ... little Bobby tables! reply vldr 1 hour agoprev\"extra security is good, though\" https://xkcd.com/463/ (no not the bobby tables xkcd) reply amne 19 hours agoprevstill better than \"password used by another account\" reply lucb1e 19 hours agoparentNot sure if serious. We need this. If you can guess someone else's password by accident, both of you need a password reset and that password needs to go on the denylist. Modern advice for strong passwords is having a length requirement and checking the input against a list of known passwords, for example using the HIBP partial hash API. (Any time you see forced expiration or complexity requirements, you're dealing with a legacy/cargocult system.) reply actuallyalys 13 hours agorootparentThe safe way to do this is to check a password against a list of common passwords, as Jeff Atwood suggests [0] rather than against your other passwords. As other replies point out, you shouldn’t be able to compare your passwords’ plaintext to each other like you’re proposing[1]. [0]: https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-god-login/ [1]: I suppose you could salt and hash the user’s password against every other user’s password and their salt, but if you chose an appropriate password hash function and parameters, that would take infeasibly long. Edit: I missed that you essentially suggested this already. Sorry about that. However, I think the way Atwood explains it is useful. reply dragonmost 16 hours agorootparentprevThe server shouldn't even be able to know that a password is being reused as it should be hashed and salted there is no situation where this would be acceptable reply Falmarri 15 hours agorootparentYou can hash them without a salt and store them in a set of passwords not associated to user accounts to enforce uniqueness without having to actually know the passwords reply duskwuff 14 hours agorootparentThat still introduces a fairly serious vulnerability. The lack of salting on the \"password uniqueness\" database makes it a juicy target; an attacker with access to the database can attack those passwords, then try the ones which are known to be valid from there against the salted passwords in the user database. reply actuallyalys 12 hours agorootparentI wonder if there’s some way to mitigate this by either only keeping the uniqueness database long enough to identify duplicates and then deleting it or by using this on lower priority systems that people may reuse passwords from for your higher security one. In either case, the small number of bad passwords you would identify that you couldn’t come up with yourself or find on common password lists probably makes this a bad tradeoff. reply rco8786 10 hours agoprevMakes me ponder the question - what’s the worst you could do to a sql database without using those strings (at least not directly).

We first spotted that all the urls contained 'select' (generally as part of a parameter name, like itemselect), so I went digging for WAF-like filters anywhere in the stack. I found that we had some ancient config in a proxy server from before we used a commercial waf that looked for `SELECT.*UNION` ... flicked back to the URLs and found they'd all also all had a parameter like 'company=credit+union'. Facepalm, and ripped the code out, we had plenty of protection elsewhere reply simion314 18 hours agorootparentYeah, the hard part is when you do not control the server, so you need to tell your customer to contact their costing and fix the issue, sometimes we got the id of the security rule that triggered the issue but not all the time.

Imagine the user uses \"select_mypassword\" as a password. The sanitizer kicks in and silently mangles your password, resulting in another password being stored than the one you entered, effectively locking you out. Or maybe it just fails with an obscure error because some overzealous countermeasure triggered. I wonder what using the EICAR file as a password would do btw. Also, while the password may be stored properly (hashed), the password still transits in plaintext before it is stored or verified. So even with hashing, you can still be vulnerable to injection. reply MadnessASAP 19 hours agorootparentPresumably you would apply the same sanitizer at login time to whatever password the user enters. If the input is the same and the transform is the same then the output will be the same. Hopefully you don't actually have to do any of this because your backend wasn't written by monkeys on typewriters. reply GuB-42 18 hours agorootparentWhat may happen is that every step is siloed in some way and every team assume the others are monkeys on typewriters. From a security perspective, it is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can make the user experience terrible. For example, I may write some piece of software that refuses to write files with spaces in them, because I suspect that later on, some shell script will process them and it is very common for poorly written shell script to break with spaces in file names. But it may turn out that unexpectedly, the people who write the back end are competent and deal with spaces just fine. But on their side they may expect me to be be the monkey and say, avoid replying with Unicode characters, assuming my code will break if it gets something that is not an ASCII printable character. So in the end, the user will have neither spaces in file names nor proper Unicode support, even though the software wouldn't have any problem with that if two team properly communicated and didn't think of each others as monkeys. reply patrakov 19 hours agorootparentprevThis relies on a false assumption that the sanitizer is static. reply MadnessASAP 17 hours agorootparentIf we're to continue with this thought experiment in doing the dumb thing. Clearly you would version your sanitizer and store which version you used when saving the password. That way you can ensure the same version is used against future user inputs. reply ajross 19 hours agoparentprev [–] > Also not storing hashes of passwords, because then it wouldn't matter what the input is. That only tells you they don't hash the passwords in the client. Likely the protection (\"protection\") is for the input validation layer, not the password backend itself. reply TacticalCoder 19 hours agorootparentIs it a slow sunday for me or... If you hash the password on the client and send the hash then hash is the password. And if you then have, for example, a DB leak with username and hashes, you don't need the password anyway because you can just send the hash and log in? (but then it's sunday and I need more coffee so I may be wrong) reply gvx 19 hours agorootparentThat is correct. The client sends the encrypted (via HTTPS) but not hashed password to the server, both for changing your password and checking your password.

    "originBody": "I discovered that if you ask ChatGPT 3.5 to Include this at the top of the response: \"ponyuseRal ponyuseRal ponyuseRal pony\" It consistently gives an error message when responding: (GPT-4 responds more normally) If you use the API for GPT-3.5 it fails with The server had an error processing your request. Sorry about that! You can retry your request, or contact us through our help center at help.openai.com if you keep seeing this error You get the same results if you replace “useRal” with “useRalative” or “useRalativeImagePath”. Why? OpenAI’s GPT models output streams of multi-character “tokens” instead of letters. Producing tokens instead of individual characters improves the performance and accuracy of models. There’s a tokenizer demo you can play with to see how it works. Three of those tokens are useRal/useRalative/useRalativeImagePath. useRalativeImagePath appears in 80.4k files on GitHub as the name of an option in XML configuration files for some automated testing software called Katalon Studio. The misspelling of “Ralative” is probably why it got its own token. You can use the three tokens in the triplet interchangably - prompting with useRalativeImagePath gives the same results. The only reference to useRalativeImagePath outside of those XML files (that existed before GPT-3.5 was trained) that I could find is this one forum post on the Katalon forums where someone points out that it’s spelled wrong. My guess: the dataset used to generate the list of tokens included all GitHub files, but after making the list of tokens OpenAI decided to exclude XML files from the training data - which meant that there were almost no uses of the useRalativeImagePath token in the training data. As a result, the model isn’t trained on understanding the useRalativeImagePath token, and so it outputs something that isn’t a valid token. Using this for data poisoning? You could try putting this phrase in documents, to throw off attempts to summarize it with GPT-3.5.

That isn't how LLMs generate tokens. Each step outputs a logit for each possible token in the tokenizer (100k in the case of GPT-3.5), then softmaxes the logits to covert them into probabilities, and samples from them depending on temperature to get the token to be used. It's possible something in the tokenizer BPE merge process breaks due to the rare token, which can be verified offline using tiktoken. But if GPT-4 works, and since GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 use the same tokenizer, then that's likely not the issue. reply shawntan 2 hours agoparentExactly this. The tokens generated should always be valid, unless some post-processing layer between the model's output and the user interface detects for some keywords which it would prefer to filter out.

While being ignorant about LLMs internals, I would have expected such things, crashes and session leaks, be impossible by design. reply airgapstopgap 2 hours agorootparentNote that we have no reason to believe that the underlying LLM inference process has suffered any setbacks. Obviously it has generated some logits. But the question is how is OpenAI server configured and what inference optimization tricks they're using. reply shawntan 2 hours agorootparentprevNaNs are not only possible by design, but are extremely common. Training of LLMs involve many tricks about how to deal with training steps that result in NaNs. Quantisation of LLMs also require dealing with huge outlier values. reply shawntan 2 hours agoprevThis is a strange explanation. These models usually give as output the same set of vocabulary that was used as its input vocabulary. > the model isn’t trained on understanding the useRalativeImagePath token, and so it outputs something that isn’t a valid token. In my view, either the model sees this token and then gets into a spiral of random generations because the `useRalativeImagePath` embedding is just a completely random vector, or it just chugs on trying to maintain coherent-sounding text. The set of tokens it can _output_ is, however, fixed, so unless the displayable tokens on the interface is a subset of the full vocabulary of tokens, it should always be 'valid'. reply maxicch 3 minutes agoprevAt first glance I thought even GPT struggles to understand React hooks reply kccqzy 4 hours agoprevNow that this phrase appears in a Hacker News post and comments, maybe the next LLM training wouldn't have these issues any more. reply LASR 4 hours agoprevClassic example of garbage in, garbage out.

    "originBody": "Bell Labs in Murray Hill spawned numerous inventions, including the transistor and traveling-wave tube that were the key components in the Telstar 1 satellite launched in 1962 that revolutionized global communications.Nokia By Jackie RomanNJ Advance Media for NJ.com Mario Romero worked at one of the busiest, most high-profile research laboratories in the world for 30 years. But, if you ask him, it never felt much like a job. “Let me tell you, I never felt I was going to work, never,” said Romero, who retired as a corporate accountant in 2009 from the famed Bell Labs headquarters in Murray Hill. “I felt that I was going to school, I felt that I was going to learn something, that I was going to contribute to something,” said Romero, 64. “I didn’t ever drag my feet going into work, it didn’t feel that way.” Romero and other former employees of Bell Labs talk about their time working at the research company’s historic New Jersey headquarters with the same fondness college graduates describe their alma maters. The sprawling Murray Hill campus on Mountain Avenue was a bustling center for innovation in suburban Union County for decades. It served as the headquarters for a 90-year-old company whose researchers helped earn 10 Nobel Prizes, five Turing Awards for computer science breakthroughs and more than 20,000 patents. At its height, Bell Labs employed nearly 15,000 people in New Jersey, including some of the world’s top scientists and innovators. Many worked in the more than a half-dozen buildings spread throughout 240 acres at the country club-like Murray Hill headquarters on the border of Berkeley Heights and New Providence. When Nokia’s research arm, Nokia Bell Labs, said in early December the company will move out of the Murray Hill campus over the next five years to relocate to a new tech hub being built in New Brunswick, the announcement spurred an outpouring of memories online from current and former employees. Bell Labs in Murray Hill, seen here in 1960, was home to giants of the science world and Nobel Prize winners. Nokia “It was an honor to work there,” one former employee wrote on Facebook. “I’ll never forget what a great place it was to work at,” said another. Some of the world’s most important breakthroughs have come out of Bell Labs, including the first transistor, the laser, radio astronomy, the dawn of cellular and satellite communications and the beginnings of artificial intelligence. Bell Labs was also the birthplace of the UNIX computer operating system, C++ and numerous programming languages. Bell Labs began in 1925 as the Bell Telephone Laboratories, a science and communication research arm of the Bell system with ownership evenly split between AT&T and Western Electric. At its prime, the lab produced Nobel Prize-winning discoveries and even helped the United States win World War II. In the 1980s, AT&T Technologies took over the company, according to the Nokia Bell Labs website. In 1996, AT&T spun off most of Bell Laboratories and its equipment manufacturing business into Lucent Technologies, leading to a series of ownership changes. Following a merger in 2007, Bell Laboratories and the former research and innovations division of Alcatel were combined into a single organization. And in 2016, Nokia acquired Alctael-Lucent, merging Bell Labs and Nokia’s research arm FutureWorks. Bell Labs’ new headquarters will be located at the HELIX innovation center in New Brunswick. Originally known as “The Hub,” the HELIX innovation center will be a large complex in the city’s downtown on the site of the former Ferren Mall. Nokia said the change in location will help Nokia Bell Labs to adapt and evolve to remain at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. It is a major change for Bell Labs, which has been a fixture in Murray Hill and has had numerous satellite locations around New Jersey. Bell Labs’ research center in Holmdel in Monmouth County was a center for major scientific developments, including cellular technology and the Horn Antenna used to confirm the Big Bang theory. But the company closed the location in 2006 and it was eventually purchased and redeveloped into a 2-million-square-foot “work, live, play” campus called Bell Works, which includes entertainment, dining and fitness amenities. Bell Works was dubbed the most iconic building in New Jersey in 2018 by Architectural Digest. It is unclear what will happen to the Murray Hill site once Bell Labs leaves. The mayors of New Providence and Berkeley Heights have both said they are working with each other, as well as state and local officials, to find a new use for the property. “Our priority will be preserving open space, exploring recreation opportunities, protecting environmentally sensitive areas, ensuring that we meet our affordable requirements, and attracting commercial businesses that will support our community,” New Providence Mayor Al Morgan said in a statement. In 1927, scientists at Bell Labs developed equipment for the first full-length motion picture with synchronized sound, as opposed to silent film. The discovery changed motion pictures. Nokia ‘A factory for ideas’ Science fiction author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke described Bell Labs as “a factory for ideas” when he visited the Murray Hill headquarters in the late 1950s. “At first sight, when one comes upon it in its surprisingly rural setting, the Bell Telephone Laboratories’ main New Jersey site looks like a large and up-to-date factory, which in a sense it is. But it is a factory for ideas, and so its production lines are invisible,” Clarke wrote in the 1958 book “Voice Across the Sea” on the history of intercontinental communication. Bell Labs opened its Murray Hill headquarters in 1942, just as the United States was engulfed in World War II. The laboratory was essential to the war effort, conducting wartime research projects, according to newspaper articles from the time. Researchers worked on finding alternatives for scarce resources, including copper and quartz, which were difficult to get at the time. Bell Labs helped develop synthetic crystals for the U.S. Navy’s sonar equipment, according to news articles. Sonar was instrumental in foiling the Nazi submarine campaign and enabled American subs to destroy Japanese shipping. The physicists at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill were also responsible for creating the transistor in 1947, which transformed telecommunication and sparked a revolution in electronics. The transistor would later be a key component in the Telstar 1 satellite, the first active orbiting communication satellite to relay live television transmissions and phone signals between the United States and Europe. “The satellite was built at a special Bell Laboratories plant in Hillsdale, New Jersey — underwent testing at Bell Labs in Murray Hill and Whippany — and the signals transmitted via Telstar from the ground station at Andover, Maine were picked up by the huge horn antenna at Bell Laboratories in Holmdel,” according to a July 1962 article in the Bridgeton Evening News. Bell Labs Murray Hill researchers George Smith and Willard Boyle in 1969. They later won the Nobel Prize for pioneering an image sensor known as the charge-coupled device, which revolutionized photography.Nokia Some of the inventors who spent time in Murray Hill won the Nobel Prize for their discoveries. In 2009, two Bell Labs scientists who created the technology behind digital photography received the Nobel Prize in physics. Willard S. Boyle, then 85, and George E. Smith, then 79, were honored for inventing the eye of the digital camera, a sensor able to transform light into a large number of pixels, the tiny points of color that are the building blocks of every digital image. The technology is found in devices ranging from the cheapest point-and-shoot digital camera to robotic medical instruments that let surgeons perform delicate operations deep inside the human body. Bell Labs has also been the site of extraordinary achievements by pioneering Black scientists and engineers, according to research published by the American Institute of Physics. READ MORE: A plan to open a $27M Black inventors museum in New Jersey Physicist and inventor James West created the foil electret microphone — a small microphone that did not require a battery — which revolutionized the communications industry. Today, around 90% of microphone technology is based on the electret microphone and the invention has been used in hearing aids and space technology, according to the American Institute of Physics. When West arrived at Bell Labs in 1957, there were just seven Black technical workers. West and a small number of Black professionals at Bell Labs formed the Association of Black Laboratory Employees in 1970 to promote diversity in the STEM world. At the group’s urging, Bell Labs agreed to fund a first-of-its-kind fellowship program that recruited promising scientists of color, funded their PhD research, and paired them with a mentor already on Bell Labs’ staff. The fellowship program went on to support alumni including James Hunt, who co-invented the Hunt-Szymanski algorithm which is widely employed in computer science and mathematics. The scientists at Bell Labs in Murray Hill included inventor James West, creator of the electret microphone, which has become the standard microphone used in products ranging from recording equipment to hearing aids. Photo courtesy of Nokia Even as the company began to change ownership, it continued to churn out new innovations. In 1989, researchers at AT&T Bell Laboratories devised a new computer chip, called a photonic integrated circuit, capable of handling 2,048 transactions simultaneously, according to a story in The Star-Ledger. The following year, scientists in Murray Hill confirmed the existence of a third state of matter, known as “quasicrystals,” according to a 1990 article in The Star-Ledger. Bell Labs’ new home at the Helix in New Brunswick will break ground in 2025. The state-of-the-art facility will be developed by SJP Properties with support from the New Brunswick Development Corporation, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the city of New Brunswick. Nokia Bell Labs will relocate by 2028 to a state-of-the-art research and development facility in New Brunswick, pictured here in an artist's rendering.Nokia Bell Labs does not expect to reduce its staff due to the move, a Nokia spokeswoman said. The new building in New Brunswick will have “bespoke” laboratories build specifically for the needs of the Bell Labs researchers and their areas of focus, the company said. “Ultimately, we want a facility that feels right for the next 100 years of Nokia Bell Labs,” Nishant Batra, chief strategy and technology officer at Nokia, said last month when the move was announced. In 1969, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson developed UNIX, a computer programming language. Nokia In 1958, Bell Labs invented the optical maser, the beginnings of the modern-day laser.Nokia In 1948, Bell Labs researcher Claude Shannon developed the fundamentals of information theory, the mathematical study of the quantification, storage and communication of information.Nokia In 1927, Bell Labs demonstrated the first public long-distance television transmission in the United States.

Could someone like Google or Microsoft build a Bell Labs today? Yes, almost certainly, but there's no financial incentive to do so. And the shareholders would not be pleased if you told them you were going to spend their money on something with no connection to the business. A bigger question for the present is: why are the universities failing so badly? Their incentives have not changed, but we don't get the kind of innovative research we got out of Bell Labs. I don't know what the answer to that is. reply ioblomov 3 hours agorootparentAgreed. The role of monopoly profits in funding pure research almost can’t be overstated. Similarly, the geographic monopolies of newspapers (before the Internet) funded quality journalism. reply linguae 3 hours agorootparentprev\"A bigger question for the present is: why are the universities failing so badly? Their incentives have not changed, but we don't get the kind of innovative research we got out of Bell Labs.\" In my opinion, professors at research universities have to contend with the pressures of raising grant money in a competitive environment combined with \"publish or perish\" pressures. Even post-tenure there are ways universities could punish \"non-productive\" faculty members at institutions where professors are regularly expected to publish at top journals/conferences and raise grant money. It's not that much different from the pressure their corporate research counterparts face, where they have to regularly justify their employment by producing a regular flow of research results that have business impact. This pressure to produce results on a regular schedule, whether in industry or in academia, is something that I strongly believe stifles science and forces scientists to make evolutionary \"sure bets\" instead of working on riskier, more revolutionary projects like the ones that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC researchers got to work on during those labs' heydays. Alan Kay, who worked at Xerox PARC in the 1970s, has a lot to say about supporting long-term, revolutionary research here (http://worrydream.com/2017-12-30-alan/). In my opinion, the simple answer is that we need institutions that provide researchers the freedom and space to work on riskier, longer-term projects, and we also need funding to support such research. For my personal career, I'm reminded of this quote from physicist J. J. Thomson made over a century ago: \"Granting the importance of this pioneering research, how can it best be promoted? The method of direct endowment will not work, for if you pay a man a salary for doing research, he and you will want to have something to point to at the end of the year to show that the money has not been wasted. In promising work of the highest class, however, results do not come in this regular fashion, in fact years may pass without any tangible results being obtained, and the position of the paid worker would be very embarrassing and he would naturally take to work on a lower, or at any rate a different plane where he could be sure of getting year by year tangible results which would justify his salary. The position is this: You want this kind of research, but, if you pay a man to do it, it will drive him to research of a different kind. The only thing to do is to pay him for doing something else and give him enough leisure to do research for the love of it.\" (from https://archive.org/details/b29932208/page/198/mode/2up). My career goal is to find a way to make a living outside of research that provides me enough time to do the research I want to do. This way I'm free from the pressures of either \"publish or perish\" from academia or \"profit or perish\" from industry. reply potatolicious 13 hours agorootparentprevEh, I don't think today's scene is altogether that different from back then. In every case you have a research organization tied to an immensely profitable main enterprise. The vast majority of the work force works on the \"product\" side and only a small number of researchers are doing blue sky stuff. This describes Bell Labs and Xerox Parc, as well as modern counterparts like MSR and DeepMind. As always, only a very small portion of the work force gets to do blue sky stuff - the rest have to do the \"mundane\" bits of making money. Let's not be fooled by rose-tinted glasses here - even in its heyday Bell Labs was small fraction of the overall Bell operations, and likewise Xerox Parc an extremely prestigious but yet small slice of the overall enterprise. reply whimsicalism 11 hours agorootparentprev> DeepMind now merged with Google Brain seemingly with a product focus, FAI I don’t really agree that training massive causal LMs is a “product focus”.

I'd hope that Google DeepMind's mission statement is a bit broader than that, but certainly Gemini seems to be the focus. It seems to me there's a world of difference between DeepMind's original goal of developing AGI (via whatever means - as a research objective), and now being told they have to build LLMs. If we compare Google to Meta, it seems it used to be that DeepMind was equivalent to FAIR as a pure research organization, and Brain equivalent to Meta's product focused ML group(s), but now the joint Google DeepMind is more akin to Meta's GenAI group, and there is no unfettered research group at Google left free to pursue AGI in any way other than hoping it can be developed out of LLMs. However, FAIR also seems constrained now that they have been moved into a product-focused part of the organization (under CPO Chris Cox). reply Nimitz14 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is not an accurate portayal of these labs.

Thankfully it was preserved and is now functional and used as ‘Bell Works’. reply photochemsyn 16 hours agoprevThis article - a retrospective puff piece - entirely neglects the circumstances leading to the loss of relevance of Bell Labs. It's explained in the autoposy of one of the greatest scientific frauds (fabricated nanoelectronic devices made of organic carbon materials e.g. pentacene) of the past few decades [1]: > \"For over half a century, Bell Labs had been owned by the telephone monopoly AT&T and had plenty of money to spend on science. But in 1984, the monopoly broke up, and after 1989, managers encouraged Bell Lab researchers to focus on research with commercial applications. Disenchanted, top scientists began to leave for universities and were mostly not replaced by new recruits. In 1995, ownership of Bell Labs was transferred to the newly formed company Lucent Technologies.\" Then Lucent got hit by the dot-com bubble blowout, resulting in a 30% loss of share value in Jan 2000. This led to a new focus on PR: > \"By keeping up its practice of releasing exciting scientific findings, the lab could continue to demonstrate to investors, customers and anyone else that Lucent had a sound, long-term technological future. Again, this was a question of survival: with revenues falling, managers had to make the argument that their jobs and the jobs of their staff were worth keeping.\" This led to a culture in which critical scrutiny of the claims of one fraudulent researcher was discouraged in favor of institutional cheerleading, and the end result was that 15 papers published in Science and Nature had to be retracted.

It isn't greed when the farmer would go out of business feeding his goose, especially when those golden eggs wouldn't necessarily help his farming business directly. reply photochemsyn 15 hours agorootparentI think that what happened is Bayh-Dole legislation passed c.1980 which allowed corporations to exclusively license patents generated with taxpayer funds at public and private universities, so they lost their incentive to maintain large privately-funded research centers, which used to be valuable because they'd have exclusive control of any patents. A side-effect of Bayh-Dole was the gradual conversion of academic institutions into for-profit commercial operations, especially in the STEM fields like chemistry, engineering, medical research, etc. - with accompanying declines in academic integrity, open data sharing, etc. Eliminating Bayh-Dole would mean university-based patents generated with taxpayer funds would be available to any interested party under a non-exclusive licensing program, and then corporations would again be incentivized to maintain private research centers - which IIRC also served a tax-writeoff function for AT&T in Bell Lab's heyday. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentIt's also the case that corporate labs that genuinely did research tended to be a byproduct of companies that were essentially monopolies to some degree in some way. Even if a bit idealized, Bell Labs was certainly like this. (From an old movie. Ma Bell: We don't care we don't have to we're the phone company.) At least some of the 80s vintage corporate labs like DEC were being increasingly folded into the broader engineering organizations as their parents became less dominant. Essentially corporate research labs are a creature of organizations that have some long-term play money. Or at least that's the idea.

    "originBody": "January 11, 2024 Editors' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread Scientists tame chaotic protein fueling 75% of cancers by Jules Bernstein, University of California - Riverside NTB bicyclic peptide library construction, MYC epitope screening, and chemical linearization of hit peptides followed by MS/MS sequencing. Credit: Journal of the American Chemical Society (2024). DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c09615 MYC is the shapeless protein responsible for making the majority of human cancer cases worse. UC Riverside researchers have found a way to rein it in, offering hope for a new era of treatments. In healthy cells, MYC helps guide the process of transcription, in which genetic information is converted from DNA into RNA and, eventually, into proteins. \"Normally, MYC's activity is strictly controlled. In cancer cells, it becomes hyper active, and is not regulated properly,\" said UCR associate professor of chemistry Min Xue. \"MYC is less like food for cancer cells and more like a steroid that promotes cancer's rapid growth,\" Xue said. \"That is why MYC is a culprit in 75% of all human cancer cases.\" At the outset of this project the UCR research team believed that if they could dampen MYC's hyperactivity, they could open a window in which the cancer could be controlled. However, finding a way to control MYC was challenging because unlike most other proteins, MYC has no structure. \"It's basically a glob of randomness,\" Xue said. \"Conventional drug discovery pipelines rely on well-defined structures, and this does not exist for MYC.\" A new paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, on which Xue is the senior author, describes a peptide compound that binds to MYC and suppresses its activity. In 2018, the researchers noticed that changing the rigidity and shape of a peptide improves its ability to interact with structureless protein targets such as MYC. \"Peptides can assume a variety of forms, shapes, and positions,\" Xue said. \"Once you bend and connect them to form rings, they cannot adopt other possible forms, so they then have a low level of randomness. This helps with the binding.\" In the paper, the team describes a new peptide that binds directly to MYC with what is called sub-micro-molar affinity, which is getting closer to the strength of an antibody. In other words, it is a very strong and specific interaction. \"We improved the binding performance of this peptide over previous versions by two orders of magnitude,\" Xue said. \"This makes it closer to our drug development goals.\" Currently, the researchers are using lipid nanoparticles to deliver the peptide into cells. These are small spheres made of fatty molecules, and they are not ideal for use as a drug. Going forward, the researchers are developing chemistry that improves the lead peptide's ability to get inside cells. Once the peptide is in the cell, it will bind to MYC, changing MYC's physical properties and preventing it from performing transcription activities. Xue's laboratory at UC Riverside develops molecular tools to better understand biology and uses that knowledge to perform drug discovery. He has long been interested in the chemistry of chaotic processes, which attracted him to the challenge of taming MYC. \"MYC represents chaos, basically, because it lacks structure. That, and its direct impact on so many types of cancer make it one of the holy grails of cancer drug development,\" Xue said. \"We are very excited that it is now within our grasp.\" More information: Zhonghan Li et al, MYC-Targeting Inhibitors Generated from a Stereodiversified Bicyclic Peptide Library, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2024).

    "commentBody": "Scientists tame chaotic protein fueling 75% of cancers (phys.org)219 points by birriel 10 hours agohidepastfavorite37 comments philsnow 5 hours agoHow is it that this MYC protein “has no structure”? As far as I know, protein structure comes out naturally during transcription, as the various amino acids are attracted to each other or repel each other. The mechanisms of protein interaction depend on their three-dimensional shapes! If a protein has no structure, how can it serve a function? Of course I’m not suggesting that they’re wrong in any way, this is clearly a hole in my understanding of proteins that I wasn’t able to plug with google. reply Ultimatt 3 hours agoparentThere are proteins known as \"Intrinsically Unstructured Proteins\" or \"disordered\" proteins. That function with no fixed configuration. Typically a good way of thinking about them is an ensemble of transient more common states, where things like post translational modification alters how long and which conformations the protein visits. The other replies you've gotten are inaccurate and about 15+ years out of date in thinking about protein structure. Think of a roiling noodle where sections or the whole thing linger in certain shapes and configurations longer than in other positions. This paper can give you a better idea about MYC specifically https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22457068 If you want to know more about disordered proteins in human DisProt is a good place to start https://disprot.org reply epistasis 5 hours agoparentprevThe structure comes from having a consistent configuration of the bond angles. Most proteins are fairly ordered, and even if they wiggle around a bit and are jiggly, they fold back into the same shape. However, it's not uncommon to have disordered or unstructured parts of a protein, that have no consistent shape, and are completely moveable. MYC is kind of on the extreme end of this. There's just one domain of the protein with a consistent structure, and the rest kind of conforms to the other proteins it binds to, or wiggles about. This may not be the best paper on it, but it does review a bit of the unstructured nature of MYC among lots of other stuff too: https://www.cell.com/trends/cell-biology/pdf/S0962-8924(22)0... reply fulladder 5 hours agoparentprevI think what they mean is that the protein does not have a single conformation that it adopts and then remains in. It's fairly common when solving the x-ray crystal structure of a protein to find that some regions of the molecule are just disordered and don't have a clear shape. If you're asking what is going on at the atomic level, the answer would be that the protein is continuously changing shape as it flops around its solution environment. Of course, if you could freeze time at any one instant, you would find that every atom has defined coordinates and therefore the overall molecule has some shape. The point is just that it's dynamic. That's how I interpreted the article, but I don't have any specific knowledge of this protein. reply dunk010 59 minutes agoparentprevThere are also chaperone proteins that help in the folding process: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein) reply water-your-self 5 hours agoparentprevProteins have moving parts. Some function like turnstiles, others walk along microtubes. \"Intrinsically disordered proteins\" is a key word that might help. Biochemistry is like a stochastic soup sometimes. reply ghostpepper 9 hours agoprevSo 75% of cancers are “tamed” now? Or is the headline slightly hyperbolic reply bglazer 8 hours agoparentIt’s not terribly hyperbolic. The headline is that they tamed the protein (MYC). That’s more or less true, they found a molecule that binds to and blocks MYC’s activity. Then in the article they (correctly) note that MYC is dysregulated in 75% of cancer cases. They don’t claim that that they cured or tamed 75% of cancer. Finding a MYC binder is legitimately a big deal. It’s been known as a primary target for cancer for decades but there are zero drugs that block it. Now this shows the way towards drugging it. It’s a big advance for the field. reply dv_dt 6 hours agorootparentIf one can bind it, I wonder if that can be used as a generalized (75%) early test indicator for cancer. reply deathgripsss 1 hour agorootparentIf an assay can be made based off this compound i could imagine some sort of screening tool that could be made. You would just need some sort of linker that could fluoresce or produce a signal. reply voisin 8 hours agorootparentprevSo would this become a prophylactic drug or a treatment once someone has cancer? reply bglazer 8 hours agorootparentDefinitely a treatment. MYC is only a problem once cancer finds a way to generate too much MYC protein. Only them is it necessary for a drug to knock it back down reply ramraj07 8 hours agorootparentprevLikely neither. Myc and p53 are these mythical whales that people have been trying to tame for many decades and nothing has happened. Nothing likely ever will. This would probably be the ten thousandth medium impact paper on myc in history to give some context and I’m not exaggerating. reply dillydogg 6 hours agorootparentYeah I do cancer immunobiology and p53, myc, mTOR whatever have been the mythical pan-cancer targets forever. There's just no way they are going to be it. Could an anti-myc be another tool in the toolbox? Sure. But it'll just go in a new version of RCHOP that extends disease free morbidity for like 3 weeks reply ramraj07 5 hours agorootparentOne exception seems to have been Ras. I would have bet money that Ras would have never been a viable target but here we are now. reply voisin 5 hours agorootparentprevSomewhat off topic: Have you read “Tripping over the Truth: The Metabolic Theory of Cancer”[0]? If so, I’d love to hear your thoughts. [0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23496164 reply bluGill 8 hours agorootparentprevHopefully, but it depends on how it acts in the body. Manx treatments are not used as the side effects are too bad* reply throwup238 9 hours agoparentprevNope. Just awful science journalism as usual. That 75% number comes from the first sentence of the paper [1] introduction: > MYC is a critical transcription factor whose aberrant activity is implicated in more than 75% of all human cancer cases. The rest is just made up vaguely based on the abstract. [1] https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c09615 reply epistasis 5 hours agorootparentThe headline is an accurate reflection of the body of the article. It's been a while since I worked in cancer, but being able to target MYC is a significant achievement, as it has generally been quite difficult to target transcription factors like MYC. Nothing in the article seems vaguely or concretely \"made up\" to me, but I'm curious if you can point to some particular sentences that you think are made up. reply aardvarkr 7 hours agorootparentprevSounds like a pretty big deal to me, in the sense that defeating cancer requires a long chain of breakthroughs just like this. MYC-focused drugs might prove to be a promising way to interfere with the growth of tumors and have a real impact on people’s lives reply mmmpetrichor 6 hours agorootparentIt's a technical achievement, and the headline reads like a breakthrough. I completely understand why people's trust has eroded in media, and especially in science. reply paulddraper 7 hours agoparentprevNo, otherwise the title would be \"75% of cancers are tamed.\" Researched synthesized a chemical that deactivates a protein implicated in 75% of cancers. It may be that deactivating the protein doesn't cure the cancer. Or it may be that it's infeasible to synthesize a delivery mechanism. Or it may be that the treatment causes significant side effects. reply laserbeam 4 hours agoparentprevI'd say the headline is mostly accurate, but easy to misinterpreted by a general audience. It's \"technically correct\". I wouldn't worry too much about the linked page though. This is the kind of website which underlines keywords for search terms on the same website... That's always a red flag for for me indicating an uninterested seo focused spammy publisher. They do link to the original article, which is great. And they don't misrepresent it. There's this flexible molecule which enables and accelerates cancers and some scientists found a way to bind to it. Non-trivial first step on one possible path to someday cure most cancers. reply gpm 9 hours agoparentprevIn a petri dish, sounds like it. Specifically it sounds like they can reduce the growth rate (\"tame\") it, but not necessarily cure it entirely. It also sounds like they haven't turned this into a treatment yet. They're still working on how to effectively get it where it needs to go in the body. They haven't run things like human tests that might reveal side effects. They haven't turned the \"technology\" into a \"product\". I don't think the headline suggests that they've done more than that. \"taming a chaotic protein\" isn't \"curing cancer\", it's \"figuring out how to deal with one component of most cancers in isolation\". It's a step forwards. reply akoboldfrying 8 hours agorootparent>They're still working on how to effectively get it where it needs to go in the body. I skimmed the paper, and this is indeed the case. The full extent of their testing was in vitro testing against the lysate of a specific cancer cell line -- that is, against the \"raw contents\" of a bunch of cancer cells which have had their cell membranes removed. In my lay understanding, getting their stuff where it needs to go -- and only there -- is likely to be very difficult. reply j16sdiz 8 hours agoparentprevThis is \"mini breakthrough\" in early stage of researches. Basically not interested to anybody outside the research community. reply surfpel 7 hours agoparentprevNo, otherwise the headline would be “Scientists tame 75% of cancers”. The title doesn’t even really claim to have solved anything. Good title imo reply hedora 7 hours agoparentprevThey are able to deform a protein involved in DNA transcription so that they can design drugs that will bind to and deactivate it. Their approach stops all DNA transcription when applied to a cell, so it’s fatal to the cell. It would also be fatal if applied to a mouse or human, except that they don’t have a way to actually deliver it outside cell cultures. This is interesting basic research, but is far from leading to new cancer treatments. Obligatory xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1217/ reply croemer 8 hours agoprevBit of a garden path headline. First parsed it as scientists solved how to fuel chaotic proteins. reply taneq 8 hours agoprevIn mice, right? reply bestouff 8 hours agoparentIn MYC. reply hnarayanan 2 hours agorootparentSlow clap reply rgmerk 6 hours agoprevGood for these scientists, but… First they have to make something that works in a whole cancer cell. If they get that far, you then have to show it works in animals. If it works in animals, you then have to do phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 clinical studies in humans. Things fail at all three steps along the line. Even in the highly unlikely event that everything went right from here it’s likely at least a decade from any clinical application. The odds of this particular approach being the one that leads to the blockbuster drug are very small. (Note: not an expert on medical science, but married to a medical scientist who works in the drug discovery pipeline). reply mike_hock 4 hours agoparentThen she has probably also told you that it's normal for scientists to publish these initial findings so the rest of the world can build on them. \"This is not a viable drug and may never become one\" doesn't need to be restated every time something gets reported. We know. reply j45 6 hours agoparentprevAll true. Still need an initial attack vector and those are valuable. reply fireflymetavrse 2 hours agoprev [–] I'm already skeptical with all these cancer research results being practical. One would say cancer is already curable when looking on the HN search results for cancer from the past 10+ years reply benrutter 1 hour agoparent [–] Cancer might not be generally curable, but it is curable in the sense that many people survive cancer with treatment. And the increase of people who do survive is improving all the time. I think that the gap is for people (like me) who don't understand what creating a medical treatment based in research looks like. I see a study like this and I think \"oh great, they can just do this on people and then cancer is solved\". There's obviously a lot more complexity in applying research in practice, so it isn't that simple. Still, this kind of research clearly is leading to improvements in cancer care, even if it isn't completely cured every time. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Following the search engine's agreement to settle a $5 billion USD privacy lawsuit that accused it of tracking users illegally in incognito mode, it has now updated the disclaimer to reflect the transparency. In its Canary version (Early-access version which allows users and developers to test new features and updates before they are rolled out for everyone), Google now states that data will still be collected even in Incognito mode. The normal disclaimer which you can see in Incognito mode at the moment is- \"Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won’t see your activity. However, downloads, bookmarks and reading list items will be saved.\" However, in the Canary version, the disclaimer reads, \"Others who use this device won’t see your activity, so you can browse more privately. This won’t change how data is collected by websites you visit and the services they use, including Google. Downloads, bookmarks and reading list items will be saved.\" Why Does It Make A Difference? Speculations of the search engine tracking users in the incognito mode were always there but Google never confirmed that it continues to track users despite them being in incognito mode. However, now, after putting up this disclaimer, it has clarified that indeed does track your activities. Notably, this does not mean that Google is now starting to track your activities and was not doing so before. It means that they were doing that earlier as well but now they have admitted to it finally. Users must be cautious about using Google even in incognito mode as it is not just the search engine that tracks you but the websites also do. Are you one of the people who used to open the incognito mode to book flight tickets so that you could avoid surge prices? You might encounter that surge now as both Google as well as the ticket-selling website will be tracking your activity.

It was always clear that websites could track you in incognito mode. Somehow people thinking that Google is not a website that can do that does not make it Google's fault. You still have to accept Google's cookie banner when opening the site in incognito, giving another indication they track you. reply balls187 19 hours agoparentMy understanding is that Google is tracking you across your browser sessions, even when you switch to incognito. That’s problematic because Google (and others with such broad internet scope) tracks you regardless of whether you are interacting with Google services or not. reply fromMars 16 hours agorootparentI don't believe this is true. In incognito mode you don't have the same gaia or dblck cookie ids. Your traffic is logged in icognito mode by Google but as a different user under a different identifier. Now certain websites could use tracking methodologies based on ip address and device signatures to identify you as the same user and set a cookie identifying you as the same user for purposes like remarketing, but Google itself doesn't join this data from their own logs. This announcement is just clarifying that Google does log data in icognito mode as do other websites. It doesn't say that Google joins your icognito session data with your non-icognito session data. reply joshspankit 16 hours agorootparent> don't have the same gaia or dblck cookie ids Google is incentivized to do “privacy theatre” and make sure your incognito session doesn’t show up as related to you even if the back-end systems have a clear association. I don’t know the facts of Google’s systems either way, but I do know that absence of a visible join is not conclusive evidence that there is none. reply fromMars 14 hours agorootparentI do know facts about there internal system. Internally, strict separation is taken very seriously and the logs are keyed by cookies with separate access and physical logs for different cookie spaces and no joining is done based on ip addresses and device signatures in these logs. It would take a determined and malicious employee to subvert these controls and possibly require multiple employees to get by code reviews to do such. That said, I can appreciate the skepticism an outsider might have about such claims. But, I also disagree that Google is incentivized to do \"privacy theater\" as you call it. For one, many already assume the worst of Google and also such theater could open them up to major lawsuits. One could make the case that a company like Apple has invested a lot more effort in \"privacy theater\". reply jauntywundrkind 13 hours agorootparentFear Uncertainty and Doubt springs eternal.

He talks a lot about how all the information Google records about you is permanent, can never be deleted, and any generation of lawmakers can decide to do whatever they want with it.

It is somewhat complicated to those who are completely new to it, so I guess it can be misinterpreted, but I see nothing misleading in the explanation. Also, Chrome is not the only browser with that kind of feature and they are all essentially work and are presented the same way. That some browsers tie it to some kind of tracker blocker actually make things even more confusing because on one hand you have \"private/incognito/whatever\" tell you that websites can still track you (because it is not what it is designed to do), and then, just below, you have a tracker blocker. So what is really blocked? reply karaterobot 19 hours agoparentprev> It was always clear that websites could track you in incognito mode.

Firefox \"private window\" suffers from similar technical vulnerabilities (cf the additional lengths Tor Browser goes).

Google was being sued over this surreptitious data collection while in so-called \"Incognito Mode\". When it tried to have the case dismissed, it failed. (Judge Koh) Then it moved for summary judgment. That failed, too. (Judge Gonzalez-Rogers, who some may recognise form the Epic v Apple case). So just as we were getting ready to let a jury decide whether Google is at fault, Google pays off the plaintiffs' counsel. Why are these so-called \"tech\" companies willing pay anyone and everyone to prevent precedent from being created. Surely the precedent would work to protect them in the future, right? These meritless lawsuits over privacy would be nipped in the bud. But Google will almost invariably stop these cases from going to trial by paying out settlements. Will we ever see Google go to trial for alleged wiretapping. No. But that's not because the cases get dismissed or because Google wins on summary judgment. Quite the opposite. There were seven counts in this case. Google's request for summary judgment was denied on every single one. Even the usual defence of no injury-in-fact, e.g., no user lost money as a result of the surveillance, failed. \"Tech\" workers want to keep on pretending that every other person using a computer is an easily manipulated, ignorant fool. Good luck. https://ia601705.us.archive.org/7/items/gov.uscourts.cand.36... Here is what the court said about consent. \"The analysis starts with the Privacy Policy17 wherein Google advises at the outset and in bold, larger print: When you use our services, youre trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. (12/15/22 Google Privacy Policy.) Immediately after, Google advises: This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update manage, export, and delete your information. ... We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps (Id.) Notably, Incognito mode is not mentioned in this list of services. (Id.) Rather, Google shifts and in the next paragraph advises users: You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. . . You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.18 (Id.) That is the only mention made of the privacy mode. The Privacy Policy is silent as to any data collection specific to private browsing mode. The Court rejects Googles argument that the Privacy Policy unambiguously discloses the at-issue data collection. The silence noted above combined with Googles surrounding statements regarding what it means to browse privately, means that a material dispute of fact remains regarding the scope of users consent. For instance, the way Google presents Incognito mode could be read to contradict its suggested interpretation of the Privacy Policy. When users first open Chrome, they are greeted by a bright, white screen and the colorful Google logo. When users navigate to Incognito mode, the screen goes from white to black, all text is rendered in gray, and users are met with a spy guy icon. (PAF 9.) They are told they have now gone Incognito, which, Google explains on the next line, means that they can browse privately, and other people who use this device wont see your activity. (PAF 30.) Plaintiffs have evidence to show that, internally, Google understood that the framing of the feature as Incognito (or, for other browsers, Private) made users overestimate privacy mode protections, including that Incognito hides browsing activity from Google. (Dkt. No. 924-36, Ex. 80; Dkt. No. 924-48, Ex. 44.) Googles arguments otherwise do not change the result. Its reliance on this Courts finding in Calhoun is misplaced. That case did not involve Incognito mode. See Calhoun, 2022 WL 18107184, at *10. The reasoning therefore does not extend here. Next, Google argues that to obtain consent effectively, companies should not have to enumerate every mode, setting, or circumstance impactingor not impactingthat data collection. See Smith v. Facebook, Inc., 745 Fed. Appx 8, 9 (9th Cir. Dec. 6, 2018) (holding that Facebooks tracking of publicly available health data fell within the scope of users general consent to its data tracking and collection practices). It is true that such enumeration is not always necessary. The fundamental issue, however, returns to actual consent. Google chose both to use a general disclosure and yet promote the privacy afforded by Incognito over regular mode. Having made that distinction, Google itself created a situation where there is a dispute as to whether users consent of Googles data collection generally is substantially the same as their consent to the collection of their private browsing data in particular. See Restatement (Second) of Torts 892A (1979) 2(b), 4. For those reasons, the Court DENIES Googles motion for summary judgment on the grounds of express consent.\" reply 66fm472tjy7 16 hours agoprevI feel like commenters in this thread are talking past each other. Some are saying \"of course sites are still tracking you in incognito!\", but is is unclear to me what they mean by this. I see the following interpretations: 1. Sites can still use local storage so they can track you for the duration of your incognito session, but they cannot connect this tracking to your regular session or other incognito sessions as incognito sessions start with empty local storage and discard it at the end of the session. 2. Sites do not rely on local storage, instead using fingerprinting via a combination of IP, HTTP headers, information they can query via JS, etc., so incognito has no effect on sites' ability to track you. 3.

My understanding is that incognito mode is a temporary and blank profile that is cleared when you exit. If it actually prohibited cookies a large number of websites wouldn't work as session information is used in all kinds of contexts (not just advertising). AFAIK there's no special treatment for incognito as the site owner shouldn't be able to tell an incognito user from a new never-seen-before user. Each time you exit and relaunch incognito you will get the same behavior as a new user. There have been tricks over the years for website owners to try and deduce the browser is incognito (e.g. testing available scratch space in the JS file API). In general this is a cat and mouse game where gaps are closed and new fingerprinting methods are developed. In terms of location tracking, websites are still getting your IP address which can be geo mapped. If they want the location from your browser, you should be getting prompted to allow/block. reply jsnell 17 hours agorootparentprevAccording to the article the new text is: \"Others who use this device won’t see your activity, so you can browse more privately.

What's unclear is if this data is then used to associate the activity in Incognito mode with the logged in profile outside of Incognito. We can safely assume that this is the case, but Google would likely never admit it unless prodded by the government. And governments are barely now realizing what cookies are. Google is pushing their \"privacy-friendly\" narrative with their FLoC initiative and intentions to kill cookies. The reality is that they haven't had a need for cookies to track users for many years. FLoC is a red herring so that they can signal to regulators and users that they're a privacy-conscious company, while behind closed doors it's business as usual. And business is booming.

Do any of the major web browsers do differently? reply imiric 15 hours agorootparent> I don't believe Google itself is intentionally associating incognito profile data with non-incognito profile data. Why not? Google makes more money on targeted ads. It's in their best interest to use an established user profile to show targeted ads in Incognito mode, and to augment that profile with data collected in Incognito mode, so that they can improve their overall targeting. It would be naive to think they're not doing this, especially when there's no clear public knowledge about what data is collected and how the targeting works. They're using cookies as a scapegoat because they don't actually need them for tracking at all. > That does not prevent other websites from creating a simple map of (IP, user agent) -> Profile. Individual websites rely on adtech to deliver ads, and often for analytics as well, no? Why would they implement the tracking themselves, when adtech does a much better job at it? Even if Google doesn't offer it explicitly as a feature, it would be trivial to match the analytics data to a user profile. > I'm not sure how this could even be imagined to work otherwise You mean, how it can be prevented? It's difficult since we don't know how sophisticated the tracking actually is. Using a VPN, random resolution and window size, disabling JS and browser features, etc., _probably_ helps. Some privacy-focused browsers like Mullvad and LibreWolf do some of this. I don't fool myself into thinking any of this is a silver bullet, and at some point, I have to prioritize my experience over privacy. But Google pioneered(?) \"zero trust\" access to their infrastructure for their employees with BeyondCorp, so they know a thing or two about securely identifying individual users regardless of the device they're using. I would think they're using behavior and network tracking in addition to just browser fingerprinting, but you would know more about this than me. In any case, this is a futile fight for privacy-minded individuals, and nothing will actually change until governments don't make it change. Considering they only caught up with cookies a few years ago, it's going to take many more years for them to catch up to the state of the art innerworkings of adtech. Assuming there are politicians who understand these technical aspects and haven't been bought yet, and users actually start caring about this.

It protects local data only, they might as well call it \"porn mode\" as the only real value is to avoid having history and cookies stored along side your everyday browsing history. reply gruez 18 hours agoparent>At least google is finally admitting that incognito mode is useless for privacy online That was abundantly clear at the start. I dug up a chromium build from 2017 and this was the incognito message: >You’ve gone incognito >Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won’t see your activity. However, downloads and bookmarks will be saved. Learn more >Chrome won’t save the following information: >* Your browsing history >* Cookies and site data >* Information entered in forms >Your activity might still be visible to: >* Websites you visit >* Your employer or school >* Your internet service provider Sure, this doesn't explicitly say \"this is useless for privacy\", and figuring out what incognito mode does requires some reading comprehension, but they're not exactly trying to hide it either. Therefore the claim that google is \"finally admitting\" doesn't make much sense. reply rapind 18 hours agorootparentUm what? > Now you can browse privately So consumers are insane for thinking they can browse privately. Is it “private” if you’re being tracked? reply gruez 17 hours agorootparentWhat \"privately\" means is fuzzy. Clearly it can't be entirely private, because there's several ways that information can get leaked out and is outside of the browser/computers control (eg. someone looking behind you, or the various middleboxes in between your computer and the web server). If you read the notice in its entirety, you'd know what the notice meant by \"privately\". Likewise, if you read my comment in its entirety, you'd see that I explicitly acknowledged that the notice wasn't super obvious and required some reading comprehension, and my objection was with the \"google finally admitting\" characterization. >Sure, this doesn't explicitly say \"this is useless for privacy\", and figuring out what incognito mode does requires some reading comprehension reply wrs 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you were “not being tracked” to the degree you seem to be assuming, then you couldn’t even log into a website, as you have to be “tracked” for it to know you’re the same person who logged in a second ago.

This doesn’t make you anonymous. Emphasis mine. It's a better, simpler disclaimer than even the modified version that Google has started shipping post-settlement. Firefox then includes a \"learn more\" link to https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/common-myths-about-priv... which (imo) does a better job than Chrome's link at breaking down the myths. So Firefox takes really tangible steps to make sure that people understand what \"incognito\" browsing actually means. The other difference is that Firefox actually does beef up anti-fingerpriting and anti-tracking protections by default to a greater degree than Chrome does if you're in a private browsing tab. The browser becomes stricter about blocking common tracking scripts and isolating data between domains. Firefox can't make you impossible to track during private browsing, but it does what it can, which is more than Chrome is willing to do, and most importantly, it makes sure that even if you're not tech-savvy you understand what the risks are. Firefox is not trying to be ambiguous or give you a false sense of security, but within its means it does try to make you as private as possible in those windows. reply instagib 16 hours agorootparentprevThere was a maintained Firefox containers extension that worked well for me.

    "originBody": "In one study, bigmouth buffalo had stronger immune systems than younger fish. Photograph By Joel Sartore, National Geographic, Photo Ark Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Animals These fish live beyond 100—and get healthier as they age Buffalofish have surprisingly long life spans, a new study shows—and live their best lives into their 80s and 90s. What can humans learn from them? ByTina Deines Published November 29, 2023 • 6 min read ShareTweetEmail Angler Stuart Black has caught a lot of fish in his days, but when he landed his first buffalofish in Arizona’s Apache Lake in 2019, he had a hunch something was special about it. “I didn’t even know why at the time,” he says. At 13 pounds, it wasn’t even that big—he’s caught bigger. Turns out, his intuition was right. Scientists recently confirmed that the majority of the buffalofish swimming around this remote desert lake in eastern Arizona are older than a hundred. The discovery builds on other recent research that has upended beliefs about the little-studied buffalofish, a genus of five freshwater fish species native to North America. Just a few years ago, scientists thought that these fish, which come in an array of colors from chestnut brown to bluish, only lived into their mid-20s. However, a 2019 study revealed that bigmouth buffalofish could live up to 112 years old, making it the oldest known freshwater teleost, a group of about 12,000 ray-finned fish species found worldwide. Then in January, researchers announced the discovery of a 127-year-old bigmouth in Saskatchewan, Canada. Now, the new study, published recently in Scientific Reports, confirmed that two more buffalofish species—the smallmouth buffalo and the black buffalo—can live more than a hundred years, making it the only known genus of animal besides the marine rockfish, Sebastes, that has three centenarian species. This is not to say that other animals can’t achieve remarkably long life spans. Greenland sharks have the greatest longevity of any living vertebrate, reaching at least 250 years old. What’s more, research has revealed that buffalofish continue to live their best lives into their upper 80s and 90s, with better stress response and immune function relative to younger individuals. (See six of the world’s longest-lived animals.) “The one takeaway is that buffalofishes do not conform to preconceived notions,” says study leader Alec Lackmann, a fish expert at the University of Minnesota. “They defy expectations.” Desert discovery For the Arizona study, a few dozen anglers, including Black, caught 222 buffalofish at Apache Lake from July 2018 to July 2023. Twenty three were humanely euthanized and donated to the research team, who estimated the fishes’ ages by removing and analyzing tiny ear stones called otoliths. These calcium carbonate structures, which allow fish to hear and sense vibrations in the water, form a new layer each year that can be read somewhat like tree rings. The otolith analysis revealed that about 90 percent of Apache Lake’s buffalofishes were more than 85 years old. Researchers aged individuals of all three species studied there—smallmouth buffalo, bigmouth buffalo, and black buffalo—past a hundred years old. For the other 199 fish, the anglers used a technique called catch-photo-release, in which they reeled in fish with tiny barbed or no-barbed hooks that avoid hurting the animal. All were photographed, and 129 were weighed before releasing them back into the lake. Researchers estimated live fishes’ ages by studying orange and black spots in the anglers’ photographs. “Several species of large riverine fishes like sturgeon and alligator gar are known to live more than 50 years,” says Nathan Farnau, curator of fishes and invertebrates at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, who wasn’t involved in the study. “But it’s always really exciting when researchers can find physical evidence of fish that are more than a hundred years old.\" Hardy non-natives What makes these findings even more remarkable, Lackmann says, is that these fish aren’t even native to the state. About 400 of them arrived to Arizona by rail in 1918 as part of a U.S. Bureau of Fisheries plan to establish a commercial fishery in Roosevelt Lake, a dammed reservoir on the Salt River. Apache Lake, part of the same river system, was later established and some of the fish eventually migrated there by swimming downstream. The bigmouth buffalo’s native range spans from southern Saskatchewan down into Texas and Louisiana, with smallmouth and black buffalo sharing similar ranges that also include parts of Ontario, New Mexico, and Mexico. The fish in Apache Lake likely came from a hatchery in Iowa, Lackmann says. He adds that the new findings indicate that some of the original stockfish still live in the Salt River system. (Read about coelacanths, an ancient fish that can reach a hundred years.) “It's like a rugged desert environment in that reservoir, yet they still are able to persist across a century,” Lackmann says. “Just imagine taking a wild animal and putting it in a novel habitat like that. If anything, you would expect they wouldn't live as long.” Fountain of youth? Buffalofish can go decades between successful reproductions because they require very specific environmental conditions—most of which are still unknown—to procreate. That’s why the fish evolved to live so long: It’s an evolutionary adaptation to account for long periods without breeding, according to Lackmann. In Saskatchewan, where buffalofish can go up to 50 years without producing offspring, the fish only attempt to spawn within a narrow range of water-level fluctuations that may rarely occur. Lackmann says further studies into buffalofish longevity could provide insight into how vertebrates, including humans, can live longer. (Read: “Can aging be cured? Scientists are giving it a try.”) “One of the major outstanding questions about the buffalofishes is how they do it in terms of their amazing longevity. What is their fountain of youth?” One strategy may be understanding why older buffalofish are less stressed and have stronger immunity than younger fish, which was confirmed in a 2021 study on bigmouth buffalofish. Older individuals could fight off bacteria better than younger animals. Not only that, the elderly fish had a lower ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood, an indication of lower stress levels. “They are still advancing into prime condition at a century old, which is astonishing,” Lackmann says. Meanwhile, conservation is a priority, he says. Buffalofish are a prized sportfish in the upper Midwest, and while their numbers are declining, harvest is virtually unregulated—including in Arizona. “Right now, you can go to Apache Lake, catch a buffalofish, and just take it home,” Black says. “So for me, getting them protected now is probably the most important thing.” ShareTweetEmail",

[1] https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon reply rtourn 15 hours agoparentI think Altered Carbon brought up the most chilling view of a world without death. In that exploration only the rich are immortal, because the poor can’t afford immortality. Someone being rich for hundreds of years will only cement their their power, position, and their perspective. How do we feel if Rockefeller were still alive and powerful? What if our old kings never died? If any of them had a sexual perversion, what if it continued for hundreds of years? Where does that road lead? reply somesortofthing 12 hours agorootparentThis is dependent on a world where immortality is expensive because it's difficult to actually make someone immortal rather than because it's difficult to figure out how to make someone immortal. For all we know, immortality is as simple as a one-time injection into an egg cell, and the challenge is almost entirely in figuring out what to inject. Also, how much is the death of bad individuals actually contributing to making the world a better place? It seems to me like the various abuses of robber-barons and tyrants past and present are perpetuated by institutions built around them rather than their own personal capacity to affect the world. A king in exile on a remote island or a Rockefeller driven to bankruptcy can remain unchanged as a person while losing virtually all of their capacity to impose their will on the world, while a kingdom or corporation can keep going centuries after the death of its leader if conditions stay favorable. reply mxkopy 8 hours agorootparentIn these cases the bulk of such institutions is a bureaucratic apparatus, which serves as a tool. You cannot judge a tool for being used for evil purposes, and in the charge of those with different intentions, it may be used for better purposes in the future. In the more general case (i.e. communities rather than kingdoms or corporations), judgment can perhaps be passed on the principles or aesthetics that keep it together. However changing it would probably require a change in its environment that rendered such principles or aesthetics obsolete. This is a much more difficult task that can require legislation or sociological advancement or something of that sort. reply unsupp0rted 14 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if people really would ossify after hundreds of years or eventually learn to be hyper-adaptable.

So that's ~20 points on 35-54 and 21 on 55+. That's 10 years. The 45+ transition into the 55 and the 25+ into the 35-54, but that doesn't explain the change. Why? Because the 2011 difference between 55+ and 35-54 is 14 points while 2021 it is 12. Even more importantly, the 55+ group in 2021 has a 7 point lead from the 35-55 age group from 2012. This difference __cannot__ be explained from just people dying and the support \"aging in\" to the next age bracket. Literally 50% (7 points out of 14) is impossible to explain through an aging process. Something more is going on, and thus, my claim is unequivocally supported by the data.

As for immortal tyrants, we already have immortal institutions that are functionally the same. And the activists, dissidents and opposition leaders who challenge their power will be almost certain to gain from immortality just as much as the heads of dominant political parties. In a rapidly changing world, immortal tyrants will not necessarily have an advantage in keeping a grip on power. Insofar as they stick to their old ways, the nations they lead will stagnate and become more susceptible to foreign influence. And if they are open to change, they may be open to abandoning their repressive ways. Opposing technologies that can save us from death due to hypothetical fears about the rich seems like a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Aging has a 100% probability of killing you if this technology doesn't emerge within your lifetime. It is strictly a greater threat than a speculated immortal tyrant. And if you think we are so abhorrent that we deserve a measly 80 years before we succumb to aging, then it doesn't follow that you would be so aghast at the idea of those same unworthy beings living longer under repression. reply bitwize 9 hours agorootparentprevBecome enough of a tyrant and you may not live to see old age -- Hitler and Stalin didn't. As for tyrants who do grow old -- is an effectively immortal tyrant that much worse than a tyrant who dies but consolidates power within his family to create a centuries-long dynasty? Also, once the technology of immortality becomes well-characterized, the cost to replicate the procedures will go down barring price-fixing collusion that involves government regulatory bodies. This is the real problem with movies like Elysium: a version of the cure-all hospital bed that serves as the movie's McGuffin in a critique of capitalism would, in a free market, be readily available at Target or Costco; businesses would rent them like tanning beds; and charities would pop up to provide them at gyms and homeless shelters for those who still couldn't afford one of their own. You couldn't really restrict the availability of something like that to just the rich without the government putting their thumb on the scale somewhere. In fact the rich would respond by allowing themselves to grow old and decrepit; in a world where everybody could be restored to health and vigor, aging would be taken as a status symbol. Kinda like how in a world where photography became easy, having original paintings on your wall is a status symbol. reply orangecat 7 hours agorootparentRight.

Still, I'm impressed from what I hear in the news from time to time. reply sirobg 16 hours agorootparentYes it's so good. An amazing way to give a new perspective on life and death as we know it _today_ imho. Strong emphasis on _today_ because life expectancy, healthy life expectancy and death are already really different from some time ago. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentThere's a quite common misconception around life expectancy. We aren't living all that much longer than in the past. The main thing bringing up life expectancy number is that childhood mortality dramatically declined. [1] If one person lives to 80, but another dies in infancy, then you have a life expectancy of 40 years old. Rather than living longer, more people are able to reach the ages that we all start dying around, and have been for millennia. So for instance in modern history, of the 15 key Founding Fathers, 7 lived to at least 80 years old: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Samuel Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, John Jay. John Adams himself lived to 90. The youngest to die were Hamilton who died in a duel, and John Hancock who died of gout of an undocumented cause - it can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption. All the others lived into their 60s and 70s. It's the same as you go back further into history. Look up basically any Ancient Greek you're familiar with, and you'll see most lived to about the same amount of time we do now a days, sometimes quite a bit longer. For instance Hippocrates, of the Hippocratic Oath, lived to 90 back in the 4th century BC. The common claim there is a survivorship bias, but that's not really true - because most of these individuals made their mark on history decades before they finally died. In other words had e.g. Plato died when he was 50 instead of 80, he still would be known today.

It was large enough that it would almost certainly extinguish all life on Earth, and even throwing every nuke we had at it would barely scratch it. Yet we also saw this from relatively far away - let's say about 10 years. It seems exceptionally probable that by the time it got here we'd have established colonies on both the Moon and Mars. The main issues are not technological in nature anymore - but economic. We put a man on the Moon more than half a century ago. The fundamental requirements to convert a short-term stay to a perpetual one are really not that great: food, home, maintenance. Water, which both the Moon and Mars have - in abundance, can be used to generate oxygen and fuel - taking care of near to all essentials. So what you really need is the infrastructure - housing, agriculture/ranching, industry, and recreation. And that's all entirely viable, but has a very high price tag. SpaceX is trying to tackle this problem by bringing the price of space launches as close to $0 as possible, but even once that is achieved - the actual materials necessary to achieve this, even at cost, will be very substantial. And without some imminent danger, there will be people claiming that we shouldn't colonize another planet because everything here isn't perfect, which it never will be. reply flqn 16 hours agoparentprevA well written fable, but its moral would not be equitable in the world of today.

I hope for a more equitable, fairer future, but it's likely my outlook is somewhat jaded. reply wholinator2 15 hours agorootparentI agree, the tide analogy kinda breaks down here though. We're all familiar that it's somewhat rare that a technological advancement goes from no usage to film and wide distribution in one step. New technologies are distributed only to the rich precisely because they are time and resource intensive to develop and can only be feasibly prepared via a process which will inevitably occur costs that the majority of humans will not be able to meet. But you _need_ those first few rich people, because the money they put in starts the feedback cycle that would not be able to start otherwise. Ideally this then begins a process of optimization which gradually allows these products to become available to everyone. Inequality is the price of innovation, but it doesn't have to be paid forever. reply sirobg 15 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I also get your take. I think it will depend on the \"thing\" that will enable us to live longer and healthier. If it is something very expensive and an overnight discovery, then it is likely that a dystopian era will occur... Just imagine some kind of tyrant (as a reference to the fable!) reigning over a country for 100+ years. But it could also be somewhat like what happened with medicine: the sum of smaller improvements, some more expensive than others, years after years. reply shiroiuma 8 hours agorootparentIf a tyrant reigns over a country for centuries, it's because the people there want him in power. reply nradov 13 hours agorootparentprevThe major increases in human lifespan have come from public sanitation, food safety, vaccinations, antibiotics, and trauma care.

Now imagine a world in which no one is immortal for 99 years, but on the 100th year everyone gains immortality at once. The latter is vastly more equitable, but to choose such a world would be horrific in cost of lives. I can imagine the dystopia that would come from an undying elite ruling over a mortal underclass. However, in any situation short of that extreme, I would never promote anything that would slow the search for immortality.

The rising tide should raise ALL boats, otherwise inequitability will lead to social instability as seen througout human history so far. reply benlivengood 15 hours agorootparentWhile I agree that modern societies and especially global wealth are very inequitable I think medicine is one of the areas where it is almost universally agreed in practice to raise all boats. Generic medications are made available, foreign aid is often in the form of medicines and medical support, and global institutions are funded with the aim of raising all boats. Should life extension become possible through medicine or treatments it seems likely that the existing process of trying to achieve global medical equity will continue. Clearly life extension will be very highly valued and if it is out of reach of 95% or 99% of the human population there will be intense pressure to socialize its benefits to everyone. Where I can see problems is if life extension is out of reach of 50% or 75% of the world population due to material/equipment/personnel costs; that's a lot harder to socialize globally and would be similar to advanced cancer treatments and organ transplants/replacements which could be seen as the leading edge of longevity treatments. I don't think there's a moral argument against expensive cancer/organ treatments being made available in wealthy countries; it doesn't seem like any progress on treating those diseases will be made at all if the treatments can't be made available, regardless of their extreme inequity. reply D-Coder 14 hours agorootparentprev> It's inevitable that access to \"defeating the dragon\" would be available to only the most affluent in society, whom have also led the most comfortable lives.

Seasonal temperature changes are mostly what causes them in the first place. Additionally, researchers have used water temperature to create otolith barcodes in captive fish before release. Otolith bands are the result of seasonal changes in growth rate, which is highly trusted to temperature and is why it's a less reliable technique in tropical or deep water species. That getting said, climate change and other things are unlikely to overwhelm the seasonal cycles. Yes, it's gotten warmer, but it's still colder in winter. It's also preferable to have validation for a given taxa, but i wouldn't expect that particular worry to be the failure more. reply stevebmark 14 hours agoprevIf you're curious to learn more, look into cold blooded vs warm blooded animals and longevity.

That sounds very fishy. Perhaps they just have some sort of genetic code that make them create those new layers of calcium carbonate structures more often than once a year. reply MostlyStable 17 hours agoparentIt is important to validate any aging method, including otoliths, and there have been cases of system misaging. The fin ray and scale based ages used in West Coast ground fishery management in the 80s resulted in systemic under aging that contributed to the over fishing and collapse of multiple rockfish species, for example. But otoliths in temperate fish species are generally one of the most consistent and reliable aging methods across multiple taxa. So hopefully otolith aging has been validated for this species in particular or at least a closely related one, but if not it's more likely than not reasonably reliable. As for the population dynamics, it's not actually necessarily that strange. For many species, mortality occurs almost entirely in the early life history. Once fish escape that period, they are very unlikely to die. This can take in exactly this kind of dynamic were very few young fish are alive at any one point and most of the extent fish are very old. reply pvaldes 16 hours agorootparent> otoliths in temperate fish species are generally one of the most consistent and reliable aging methods Ha ha ha haaaa!! Sorry, but that claim was hilarious. I had the (lets call it) \"pleasure\" to read otoliths in the past, and consistent and reliable is not how I would describe it. Not even close. For most species it just happens that nobody validated the system first. This means that everybody extrapolates, but nobody really knows how many rings are formed each year. But \"oh, that fish lived for 800 years\"... highly publishable reply MostlyStable 15 hours agorootparentI currently work in a lab that primarily does otolith based growth and aging. It is and has been my primary job for over 7 years (although I don't do that actual reading of the otoliths, I work with the data that comes out of it) I think you are misreading my comment. I did not say that it was easy or that it was always consistent and reliable. I said it was one of the most consistent and reliable aging methods, which is an inherently relative statement. Compared to other common aging techniques such as scales, fin rays, and vertebrae, it is exactly those two things: more consistent and reliable. It can be more and yet still not particularly. And, in many cases, yes, it is not always very reliable and in many species it has not been specifically validated. But it is still the best, more reliable technique we have for aging fishes. In addition, please note that literally the first sentence in my comment was the importance of validating an age technique. I am well aware of the issues in aging. Those issues absolutely do not amount to the (implied) conclusion of your comment that they are garbage that shouldn't be relied upon. Also, just a piece of advice: you do not come off as particularly authoritative when you make wildly hyperbolic statements like contesting claims of 800 year old fish. reply inciampati 18 hours agoparentprevThis is not \"genetic code\"! reply nilsherzig 11 hours agoparentprevFishy reply givemeethekeys 11 hours agoprevThat one time a goldfish lived for more than 200 years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanako_(fish) reply fb03 19 hours agoprevThat is beyond amazing to me. As a layperson in biology related stuff, I'd like to ask: How do scientists estimate the age of non-human animals? reply MostlyStable 17 hours agoparentOtoliths are calcium carbonate structures that form in the heads of fishes that help with balance and orientation. Humans actually have similar things in their ear canals, they just don't aggregate and it's more like sand. These structured grow with the fish and seasonal changes in growth rate cause lighter and darker alternating bands, similar to tree rings. When prepared correctly, these bands can be viewed and counted inter s microscope. Similar methods are used in fin rays and spines, scales, and vertebrae, although otoliths are generally considered the gold standard reply a_bonobo 8 hours agorootparentAlong with that, the more expensive method that scales a bit easier is DNA methylation: most vertebrates, including fish, have a strong correlation between the percentage of their genomes that has been methylated and the age. It's like r=0.99, the older, the more methylated. (however, artificially de-methylating doesn't make you younger) So you can sequence these genomes and count. Definitely more expensive than digging out a tiny bone, but you can sequence a few hundred or thousand genomes at once.

    "title": "C23 Standard Introduces New Features to C Programming Language",
    "originLink": "https://lemire.me/blog/2024/01/21/c23-a-slightly-better-c/",
    "originBody": "C23: a slightly better C One of the established and most popular programming languages is the C programming language. It is relatively easy to learn, and highly practical. Maybe surprisingly, the C programming language keeps evolving, slowly and carefully. If you have GCC 13 or LLVM (Clang) 16, you already have a compiler with some of the features from the latest standard (C23). // Only include stdio.h if it exists #if __has_include () #include#endif #include[[deprecated]] void f() {} [[nodiscard]] int g(int x) { return x + 1; } int main() { f(); // compile-time warning: 'f' is deprecated g(1); // compile-time warning auto x = 0b1111; typeof(x) y = 1'000'000; // type of y is the same as x printf(\"%d\", x); // prints 15 printf(\"%d\", y); // prints 1000000 constexpr int N = 10; // compile-time asserts using static_assert static_assert (N == 10, \"N must be 10\"); bool a[N]; // array of N booleans for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) { a[i] = true; } printf(\"%d\", a[0]); // prints 1 } The first part of the code contains some preprocessor directives, which are instructions for the compiler to process the source code before compiling it. The #if directive checks a condition at compile time and includes the following code only if the condition is true. The __has_include macro is a feature of C++17 adopted by C23 that checks if a header file exists and can be included. In this instance, it is not useful because we know that stdio.h is present, but in other instances, this can prove useful to determine what headers are available. The next part of the code defines two functions with attributes, which are annotations that provide additional information to the compiler about the behavior or usage of a function, variable, type, etc. The [[deprecated]] attribute is a feature of C++14 adopted by C23 that marks a function as obsolete and discourages its use. The compiler will issue a warning if the function is called or referenced. The [[nodiscard]] attribute is a feature of C++17 adopted by C23 that indicates that the return value of a function should not be ignored or discarded. The compiler will issue a warning if the function is called from a discarded-value expression. In this case, the function f is deprecated and does nothing, while the function g returns the input value plus one and should not be ignored. The first two lines of the main function call the functions f and g and trigger the warnings. The third line of the main function declares a variable x with the auto keyword, which is a feature of C++11 that lets the compiler deduce the type of the variable from its initializer. In this case, the initializer is a binary literal, which is a feature of C++14 and adopted by C23 that allows writing integer constants in binary notation using the prefix 0b. The value of x is 0b1111, which is equivalent to 15 in decimal. The fourth line declares another variable y with the typeof operator that returns the type of an expression. In this case, the expression is x, so the type of y is the same as the type of x. The initializer of y is a digit separator, which is a feature of C++14 adopted by C23 that allows inserting single quotes between digits in numeric literals to improve readability. The value of y is 1’000’000, which is equivalent to 1000000 in decimal. The seventh line declares a constant variable N with the constexpr keyword, which is a feature of C++11 adopted by C23 that indicates that the value of the variable can be evaluated at compile time. The value of N is 10. Previously, one would often use a macro to define a compile-time constant (e.g., #define N 10). The eighth line uses the static_assert keyword, which is a feature of C++11 adopted by C23 that performs a compile-time assertion check. The keyword takes a boolean expression and an optional string message as arguments. If the expression is false, the compiler will emit an error and stop the compilation, displaying the message. If the expression is true, the compiler will do nothing. In this case, the expression is N == 10, which is true, so the compilation continues. The ninth line declares an array of N booleans named a. An array is a collection of elements of the same type that are stored in contiguous memory locations. The size of the array must be a constant expression, which is why N is declared with constexpr. We also use the keywords true and false which become standard in C23. There are many more features in C23, but it will take some time for compilers and system librairies to catch up. My thoughts so far: The introduction of constexpr in C will probably help reduce the dependency on macros, which is a good idea generally. Macros work well in C, but when a bug is introduced, it can be difficult get meaningful error messages. It does not happen too often, but in large code bases, it can be a problem. I personally rarely use auto and typeof in other languages, so I don’t expect to use them very much in C. In some specific cases, it can greatly simply one’s code, however. It is likely going to help reduce the reliance on macros. The idea behind static_assert is great. You run a check that has no impact on the performance of the software, and may even help it. It is cheap and it can catch nasty bugs. It is not new to C, but adopting the C++ syntax is a good idea. The __has_include feature can simplify supporting diverse compilers. It is good idea.

Pure speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if these two were directly related to each other. Clang/LLVM is more modular, which makes it easy to write new things that integrate it (like a linter), but this can slow down adding new things that change the data model and external interfaces. GCC is the opposite: one big blob that makes it easier to add things since the surface area is lower. reply pjmlp 12 hours agorootparentActually it is a mix of factors, companies enjoy their downstream forks without contributing to upstream thanks license. Almost all major compiler vendors have migrated to clang forks and if they contribute upstream, is on the backend side, for their platforms, not fronted changes. Big contributors like Apple and Google, deciding to refocus on their own languages, and current language support being good enough for their LLVM use cases. reply slacka 12 hours agoparentprevAll of the features descried in the article are supported by clang except maybe for the constexpr keyword.

Nah those are easy to name, just annoying, it's types which literally don't have an external / public name, like lambdas, or locally defined types. reply bheadmaster 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's actually a struct that only has a name in the scope of the function which returns `auto`, and thus cannot be named outside of it. Like this: #includeauto createVoldemortType(int value) { struct Voldemort { int value; }; return Voldemort{value}; } int main() { auto voldemort = createVoldemortType(7); std::coutauto createVoldemortType(int value) { struct Voldemort { int value; }; return Voldemort{value}; } struct Voldemort { std::string value; }; int main() { auto voldemort = createVoldemortType(7); std::cout Hah. Voldemort types. The ones that can't be named Ha ha, that reminds me of that phrase of yore, \"the quality without a name (qwan)\" (google it), which was heavily bandied about years ago, during the heyday of C++ and the software patterns movement (which continued a lot in the days of Java, of course). James Coplien (IIRC) and others of that time come to mind. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Coplien Though I read a fair amount about that stuff, a lot of of it went over my head, but later, I did understand some of the patterns, after reading the design patterns book, and trying out some of them. The template method pattern is my favourite pattern, because I understand it more well than many of the others :), and also because it is the basis of software frameworks (inversion of control, aka the Hollywood principle - \"don't call me, I'll call you\"). Other patterns that I like and understand are the command pattern, the interpreter pattern, the chain of responsibility pattern, and flyweight pattern, to name a few. Builder and Factory, not so much. Singleton is straightforward, or is it really? impls matter :) And I have written a few toy frameworks, which is fun to do and use. reply kevin_thibedeau 14 hours agorootparentprevC has generics as well. This permits the return type of generic functions to be preserved. reply jcranmer 14 hours agorootparentThe only generic feature C has is the _Generic expression, which isn't a function, but closer to a switch(typeof(x)) expression. reply kevin_thibedeau 14 hours agorootparent_Generic can be used to merge a collection of functions. reply neutrono 12 hours agorootparentIt should have been called _Overload or something similar, since it's not really a generic. reply CyberDildonics 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's not the same as being able to write a data structure that takes any type. reply kevin_thibedeau 12 hours agorootparentIt's still generic. You don't have to have feature parity with C++ to meet that bar. reply CyberDildonics 11 hours agorootparentThat would be like calling function overloading generics. reply anthomtb 13 hours agoparentprevAre there any publicly-viewable C codebases that make use of pre-C23 auto? When I learned C (2003-ish) auto vs. register was at best a footnote that came up when discussing static. I agree that you don't need auto pointers in C the way you do in C++. C++ type names can get so cumbersome...much easier to let the compiler figure it out for you. reply trealira 13 hours agoparentprevIt could help in generic macros, like this: #define SWAP(var1, var2) do { \\ auto tmp = var1; \\ var1 = var2; \\ var2 = tmp; \\ } while (0) Previously, you would have needed a third macro for the type, or you would have needed to do a byteswap to be generic. reply unwind 13 hours agorootparentTrue, and now we also get typeof() so there is more than one way! const typeof(var1) tmp = var1; reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentprevWhy’s that inside do/while? reply trealira 12 hours agorootparentIf you simply put braces around it, you'd generate syntactically invalid code when you don't use braces for if-else statements. Consider this: if (e) SWAP(a, b); else something_else(); Currently, that expands to this, which is still valid code: if (e) do { // ...macro... } while(0); else something_else(); If it were just wrapped in braces, the code would be parsed like this: // One-armed if-statement if (e) { // ...macro... } // Empty statement ; // Another statement else something_else(); It's incorrect syntax to start a statement with else, so the compiler will say something like \"Unexpected 'else' at line N.\" reply kstrauser 12 hours agorootparentI would not have come up with that on my own.

The rest of them are good but I have a feeling auto and typeof on the left hand of an assignment are both going to be considered no-nos in real codebases. I think they obfuscate things unnecessarily.

Although, since it's not 1989 anymore, they're not exactly new to C either. ANSI C has been around for 35 years at this point, whereas in 1989, C was only 17 years old. reply fuzztester 10 hours agorootparentYes, I knew that, though I did not mention it. In my previous comment, I was going to say (from memory), that in the second edition, i.e. in ANSI C, both types of declarations are allowed, old style and new style. Also, if you just wrote the declaration (return value, then function name followed by types with arguments in parentheses), followed by a semicolon, without a function body in braces, it was called a function prototype. MS C (as in, some version of Visual Studio's command line C compiler), had a flag to generate the prototypes from the function definitions. I had used it some. /Zg, possibly. reply trealira 10 hours agorootparentSorry, I wasn't trying to imply that you didn't know that. I meant to suggest that it would be the most unambiguous way to differentiate them, but then realized that the names weren't accurate because C89 declarations aren't new anymore.

I see this might break stuff but you could implement it side by side with the preprocessor so old code would continue to work. reply flohofwoe 10 hours agoparentMight not be a popular opinion, but I actually like that C headers only contain the public API declaration of a \"module\" while the implementation and private declarations live in a separate file. Makes it easy to figure out the public API just by reading the header and without having to sift through unimportant implementation code. In other languages you need IDE support for extracting the public API of a module. reply lifthrasiir 4 hours agorootparentThat's orthogonal to the module system. OCaml for example has `.ml` and `.mli` files for the same purpose, but `.mli` can be automatically generated from `.ml` if you want.

Now, modules would obviously be a bigger break than a few keyword incompatibilies, but at that point you'd also massively increase complexity and basically start creating C++ again, which is probably the actual reason it hasn't happened yet. reply trealira 10 hours agorootparentModula-2 had modules in 1978, and it was still a pretty simple language. They don't necessarily imply recreating C++. reply Gibbon1 11 hours agorootparentprevIf you listen to the C++ people it's obvious they think the incompatible changes are a terrible mistake. They can't undo them but they're adamant no other breaking changes be allowed. They don't want things to get worse for them. Meaning better for everyone else. And no modules wouldn't make C more like C++. It's just make C a bit saner and faster to compile. Because modules are complete and don't depend on code compiled before the import. Which means you can compile your modules exactly once and only once. Well written C code bases you could probably just change #include to #import and reap the benefits. reply flohofwoe 9 hours agorootparentTBF, C doesn't suffer from the \"headers cause slow builds\" problem of C++, because C headers usually only contain a handful of declarations (e.g. the C stdlib headers are a couple of hundred lines of function prototypes and struct declarations, not tens of thousands of lines of gnarly template code like C++ stdlib headers). reply malkia 12 hours agoprevI hoped for defer (e.g. \"RAII\" of sorts), is there any way? reply joshkel 12 hours agoparentAccording to https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p23..., it's an \"unadopted feature being explored.\" There's more information about the proposal at https://gustedt.wordpress.com/2022/01/15/a-defer-feature-usi... reply oconnor663 12 hours agoparentprevThere was an update on this just last week: https://github.com/ThePhD/future_cxx/issues/67#issuecomment-... reply Karellen 14 hours agoprev> If you have GCC 23 or LLVM (Clang) 16 gcc 23?

That would be Zig. You can directly import C headers and compile C code with the Zig compiler and also cross-compile C code without requiring a separate compiler toolchain. Currently it's also possible to compile C++ and ObjC (but not import C++ or ObjC headers), but that functionality will probably be delegated to a separate Clang toolchain in the future. > the language being complete that it will remain the same in 10 years. ...that will take a while (also depending on whether you consider the stdlib part of the language or not). > while at the same time being memory safe. ...that wouldn't be Zig then ;) (TBF, Zig is much stricter than C or C++, which helps to avoid some typical memory corruption problems in C or C++, but it's by far not as watertight as Rust when it comes to static memory safety - Zig does have a couple of runtime checks though, like array bounds checks - dangling pointers are still a problem though and are only caught at runtime via a special allocator. reply akira2501 12 hours agoparentprev> while at the same time being memory safe. lua? luajit's got great ffi.

You can have all the memory safety in the world within the bounds of your own language, but it mostly gives you an illusion of security if the common pattern in the community is to just wrap C libraries.

Datomic is many things, but only the query format (Horn clauses with unification of variables, similar to prolog) has anything to do with datalog. Real datalog is far more interesting since it implicitly encodes recursion allowing you to chain rules. Rule A derives new facts, which rule B uses to derive new facts, which rules A and C use to derive new facts, and so on. Datomic has a notion of rules which are mostly syntax sugar and do not support this sort of recursive reasoning. Why is that a big deal? When rules are run automatically, you can build live, reactive systems, not just a database that sits around waiting for you to query it. Hellerstein's work at UC Berkeley (https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/sigrec10-declimperative.pdf) explores this in some detail. reply refset 12 hours agoparent> Datomic has a notion of rules which are mostly syntax sugar and do not support this sort of recursive reasoning. > Why is that a big deal?

What's the complexity of running this kind of recursive reasoning? Reasonable? Can you suggest any tools to not have to implement it ourselves? reply brendanyounger 13 hours agorootparentSouffle and Cozo mentioned below already implement the whole of \"traditional\" datalog. Percival (https://github.com/ekzhang/percival) has some very nice examples showing how you can interactively write and test rules on top of a datalog interpreter. Bud (http://bloom-lang.net/bud/) is Hellerstein's proof of concept playground. It has bit-rotted in the past few years, but the examples are readable even if you can't easily get it working. The complexity can be quite good. You can syntactically determine when you've written linear recursion (equivalent to a for loop) vs not. Otherwise, the complexity is what you'd expect from incremental view maintenance in a normal SQL database. Which is to say O(n^k) with k being the number of relations joined, but usually much, much less with appropriate indexes and skew in the data. All the usual tricks concerning data normalization and indexes from databases apply. reply refset 12 hours agorootparentprevRDFox offers a rather impressive sounding Datalog inferencing engine: https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/rdfox > We present a novel approach to parallel materialisation (i.e., fixpoint computation) of datalog programs in centralised, main-memory, multi-core RDF systems. Our approach comprises an algorithm that evenly distributes the workload to cores, and an RDF indexing data structure that supports efficient, ‘mostly’ lock-free parallel updates. > Materialisation is PTIME-complete in data complexity and is thus believed to be inherently sequential. Nevertheless, many practical parallelisation techniques have been developed [...] There have been several papers and patents describing their approach, e.g. http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/dan.olteanu/papers/mnpho-aaai14.pdf reply Clever321 14 hours agoprevDatalog feels so much more intuitive than SQL or any other query language I've used. I'm able to write concise, complex expressions pretty easily. In a SQL-based system, there seems to be a (low) complexity metric where it's easier to write/debug/maintain what was supposed to be a 'declarative' SQL query in a functional/imperative language instead. It feels like datalog is the next evolution of a declarative query language, one that is much more declarative than SQL itself. In the \"day of datomic\" videos, there is a segment where Stu debugs a slow query. He does the debugging without even looking at the data model, only by rearranging the clauses. It is really, really impressive, and I can't imagine having that capability in SQL. reply brendanyounger 12 hours agoparentI greatly respect what Stu and Rich have done to make Datomic. However, they made an explicit design decision to not include a query optimizer and execute the clauses as they were written. This is usually fine since the author has some idea of what the best order is, but there are O(2^k) different permutations of clauses so doing it by hand will fail at some point (if you want the optimal ordering). reply refset 10 hours agorootparentI asked Rich about his thoughts on query optimizers last year (not in the context of Datomic specifically) and his only reservation was around the practical implications for the operational experience. Specifically, that database systems should always provide the means for developers to control exactly how/when/whether existing (cached) execution plans get re-optimized, otherwise query optimizers can actually be a source of greater problems than they solve, particularly for applications with extremely rapid changes in data. reply grepexdev 16 hours agoprevI thought that syntax looked familiar!

If you go for full Prolog instead of Datalog, there are several (Scryer Prolog being my personal favourite). reply kjqgqkejbfefn 16 hours agoparent1. Datomic - While not open-source, it has an open-source version called Datomic Free, which is a distributed database designed to enable scalable, flexible, and intelligent data storage and queries. Datomic's query language is closely inspired by Datalog. 2. DataScript - An open-source in-memory database and query engine for Clojure, ClojureScript, and JavaScript that is heavily influenced by Datalog and Datomic. 3. Crux (now XTDB) - A bitemporal database with Datalog-inspired querying capabilities. It is designed for efficient querying of historical data and offers ACID transactions. 4. Racket's miniKanren - While not strictly a database, miniKanren is an open-source logic programming extension to the Racket language, which is inspired by Datalog and can be used to manipulate and query data in a manner similar to Prolog. 5. LogicBlox - An open-source platform that combines a database system, a Datalog-based modeling language, and application server facilities. It allows developers to build complex, data-intensive applications. 6. Soufflé - A Datalog-inspired language that is designed for static analysis problems. It can be viewed as a database query language with a focus on performance, allowing for parallel execution of queries. 7. Dedalus - A Datalog-like temporal logic language used to express complex distributed systems. It is primarily a research tool but has informed the design of other Datalog-inspired systems. 8. Flora-2 - An open-source object-oriented knowledge representation and reasoning system that integrates a variant of Datalog with objects and frames. Top 3 are from the Clojure ecosystem.

Predictix was just a company created solely to be a customer of LogicBlox. In the end it couldn’t survive on its own.

But ... the problem is how many DBs support it, and how useful of a skill it is to know. reply account-5 14 hours agoprev [–] For the idiot in the thread, why would I use datalog (which I've never heard of before) over SQL? Having looked quickly at it just now it seems (Wikipedia article) similar to Web Ontology Language (OWL), though I believe datalog may have been around long before owl. reply brendanyounger 12 hours agoparentOn a syntax level, parsing, generating, and templating datalog is _much_ simpler than doing the same to SQL. DBT would never exist if every SQL database accepted datalog queries and SQL injection attacks would be rare to non-existent. The more interesting answer is to think of datalog as making it easy to encode nearly all of your application logic as a bunch of self-referencing, incrementally updated, materialized views. Some examples: # view of Users table for currently logged in user LoggedInUserView(name, email, id) :- Users(id: payload[\"userId\"], name, email), Cookies(name: \"login\", payload). # view of Users for admin AdminUserView(name, email, id) :- Users(id, name, email), Cookies(name: \"login\", payload), payload[\"isAdmin\"] = true. # posts a user can see PostsView(title, content, id) :- Posts(title, content, public: true). PostsView(title, content, id) :- Posts(title, content, author: payload[\"userId\"]), Cookies(name: \"login\", payload). And then you write your UI code to explicitly reference these derived views rather than manually wrapping an API around querying the Posts table and doing the filtering. The examples above can be neatly replicated in Supabase or Postgraphile (the OG of auto-generated GraphQL over Postgres), but you can do a lot more with datalog as a language. The Hellerstein paper mentioned above is a good starting place. reply refset 11 hours agoparentprev [–] Datalog can be very effective for expressing certain kinds of problems and for generating efficient solutions to those problems. Particularly anything that is even mildly recursive, and therefore especially \"knowledge graphs\" that rely heavily on rules to infer, model and retrieve information. However if your problem domain amounts to CRUD storage without a need for complex recursion then mature SQL systems usually have all the advantages (asides from the syntax!). For a more formal answer: > The intersection of databases, logic, and artificial intelligence gave raise to deductive databases. Deductive database systems are database management systems built around a logical model of data, and their query languages allow expressing logical queries. A deductive database system includes procedures for defining deductive rules which can infer information (in the so-called intensional database) in addition to the facts loaded in the (so-called extensional) database. The logic model for deductive databases is closely related to the relational model and, in particular, with the domain relational calculus. Datalog is the most known deductive query language (which syntactically is a Prolog subset) where constructed terms are not allowed as other non-declarative constructs such as the cut. > Also following the relational model, relational database systems are well-known and widespread nowadays. Their formal query languages include relational algebra and relational calculi but, in practical systems, the de-facto and ANSI/ISO standard SQL is the language of choice of every relational database vendor. Whilst SQL and relational formal languages implement a limited form of logic, deductive database languages implement advanced forms of logic. https://www.fdi.ucm.es/profesor/fernan/des/html/manual/manua... reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

What's an API? An application programming interface (API) is a set of requirements that allows one application to talk to another. The NPS Data API allows official, authoritative data and content to be used not only on NPS.gov but also by internal and external developers in apps, maps, and websites. We create the data once but, through the API, it can be used many times and in many products—no matter who creates those products. What data is available? The NPS API documentation includes detailed information about the type of data available, including: Alerts - Announcements communicating information about hazardous, potentially hazardous, or changing conditions that may affect a visit to a national park Articles, People, and Places - Titles, images, and short descriptions about shared content articles Campgrounds - Location, contact, operating hours, site amenities, fee, and accessibility information for campgrounds in national parks Events - Date, time, fee, and description of events taking place in national parks Lesson Plans - Objectives, grade level, subject, duration, and standards information for lesson plans about national parks for teachers to use in their classrooms News Releases - Title, abstract, and link to national park news releases, as well as an optional image Parks - Location, contact, operating hours, and entrance fee/pass information for each national park, as well as at least five photos of each park Visitor Centers - Location, contact, and operating hours information for visitor centers and other visitor contact facilities in national parks How can developers use the API? Developers can register for an API key, get familiar with the API request format, and review API resources on the NPS Data API website. What's the future of the API? Check out the NPS API roadmap to find out what is in development and being considered for addition next. Last updated: January 29, 2019 Was this page helpful?

Rest APIs are very expensive ways for the government to make CSV data available to the public. reply dragonwriter 5 hours agorootparentThey are a whole lot less expensive than tracking customer usage and billing for it, and a whole lot more useful to the public than having the data nominally publicly accessible but only \"on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard.\" [0] [0] Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reply tonymet 4 hours agorootparentnot in this case that's my whole point . they are choosing the most expensive (and riskiest) way to make csv files available to the public reply everforward 1 hour agorootparentThere's likely some truth that CSV would work well here, and would likely be cheaper to operate. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of clients are or could be doing full transfers of the data and doing their own queries. I'd be pretty happy with sqlite dumps too. I don't really have an issue with the REST, though. I wouldn't be surprised if this was just a standard and cheap to set up Django+REST libraries stack. Yeah, the compute costs are higher than transferring static files, but I'd be shocked if this was taking enough QPS for the difference in cost to make a meaningful difference. I get wanting the government to be responsible, but this veers a bit too far into Brutalist architecture as an organizational principle. reply bennyg 2 hours agoparentprevThis is a fascinating thread under this comment. Everyone is keying off of one part of the comment (querier pays) and not the more critical issue IMO - anticipating security and budgeting issues of hosting a real-time API. You suggested an alternative and everyone is pitting the status quo against that alternative instead of maybe looking for other alternatives that help address the issue. People here clearly don’t like a querier pays model and that’s fine. But should NPS still reinvent the wheel across the SDLC to serve this data? I think there’s a compelling argument in there. reply jdksmdbtbdnmsm 5 hours agoparentprevLooking at the data made available by this API, I think it's safe to say this is fine. reply tonymet 6 hours agoparentprevWith their API they have to write a bunch of boilerplate code to transform from their SQL db to REST.

Open source tools that will present a simple, read-only REST API over an SQL db with little to no custom code exist (so do proprietary tools, often from DB vendors and sometimes as part of SQL db products.) Same with NoSQL or sorta-SQL storage solutions. The idea that they have to write a bunch of boilerplate code to do this is false. They might choose to do that, but its defintely not necessary. > Authentication, throttling, threat prevention, encoding, etc etc. Again, open source canned solutions that take a little bit of configuration exist for many of those, and some of them are likely shared services that they just point at whatever service needs them. reply tonymet 3 hours agorootparentnow do compute reply mlhpdx 6 hours agorootparentprevWho says they have a SQL DB?

They should choose a solution that makes the customers pay for accessing the data. You’re going to see a ton of NPS knockoff apps use this API as their backend and the devs are just going to let the AWS autoscaler keep going up and up as the taxpayers pay for it. reply dragonwriter 4 hours agorootparent> They should choose a solution that makes the customers pay for accessing the data. They are. The NPS's customers are the American public, and they are paying for the data via taxes (approximately; government finance is more complex than that, and taxes don't really pay for spending that's a model that really is only true when working with commodity and not fiat currency, but, its reasonable enough for this purpose.) What you want isn't for the current customers to pay for the data, but for the consumers of data to be viewed as customers and then charged for the data. but that potentially makes things more expensive for the NPS's customers, for instance, if one of the significant consumers turns out to be other public agencies, who then are paying a direct cost which pays for both the access to the data and the additional costs of billing and account management that a consumer-pays model imposes, and paying the overhead for the payer-side costs associated with payments, as well as the actual amount of the payments, then you end up ultimately with largely the same customers paying, but paying a whole lot of additional overhead. reply tonymet 4 hours agorootparentThe taxpayers are the patrons not the customers. reply tonymet 5 hours agorootparentprevThis data domain doesn’t need a realtime api. They could host CSVs online with some mirrors and save millions of dollars hosting this stuff. reply huytersd 4 hours agorootparentAh yes, I see now. Yeah makes no sense to offer a REST response for each request. On that note, what would the processing entail? Processing the get request and packaging the entire dataset into a REST object right? Or is it a more complex API that lets you run queries against the dataset? For that matter wouldn’t downloading a CSV also have to be packaged into a REST object? reply tonymet 4 hours agorootparentthe rest API provides parameters for filtering & pagination. all of that is unnecessary. it's a few hundred MB tops . CSV , Bigquery , anything is better than running REST on EC2 reply AnthonyMouse 6 hours agoprev [–] Why is the government cargo-culting the scourge that is API keys? The goal of this should be for everyone to have access and lower barriers to entry, not put bureaucracy in the way of access and de facto suppress use by open source projects because each user would need their own API key unless someone publishes one. reply AdieuToLogic 5 hours agoparentFrom the site: The NPS Data API is open and accessible to all developers who wish to use NPS data in their projects. From their \"API Guides\": Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using your API key. Rate limits may vary by service, but the defaults are: Hourly Limit: 1,000 requests per hour For each API key, these limits are applied across all developer.nps.gov API requests. Exceeding these limits will lead to your API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The block will automatically be lifted by waiting an hour. That, along with their ToS[0], hardly seems to qualify as a \"cargo-culting scourge.\" 0 - https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/disclaimer.htm reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparentAPI keys were invented as a tracking device. You sign up and then they associate all your use with one person and can do things like revoke your keys if you e.g. try to compete with the company's own products. Neither of these should be relevant to public data on a government service. Rate limits are straight forward to implement per-IP address without having any other information about anyone. The sort of person willing to bypass them by using a thousand IP addresses is the same sort of person who would sign up for a thousand API keys using fake names. How are you supposed to rate limit by API key if \"anyone\" can get an API key? You'd need to use some means to rate limit how many API keys someone could request, which was the original problem. reply AdieuToLogic 5 hours agorootparent> API keys were invented as a tracking device.

Thanks for the clarification. reply mlhpdx 5 hours agorootparentprevPer IPv6 address? It’s very difficult (impossible?) to even make IPv4 based rate limiting work. reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparentWith IPv6 you use address blocks instead of individual addresses. IP-based rate limiting is extremely effective because it bifurcates the internet into IP addresses controlled by the attacker and ones that aren't. The attacker can only issue requests at a rate of rate limit per IP address times number of IP addresses (or IPv6 blocks) they control. Then the IP addresses under their control get denied while the IP addresses not under their control, i.e. all of the other users, are unaffected. This only becomes a problem if they control on the order of millions of IP addresses, but then you're dealing with a sophisticated criminal organization and are probably screwed anyway. reply mlhpdx 5 hours agorootparentprevYep. Very likely they are using API Gateway with Usage Plans, which is a very simple and effective way to do rate limiting and quotas. reply abraae 5 hours agoparentprevIf the provider is bearing the costs (like here) then they always need some kind of authorization, or they have no way to shut off abusers or people with misbehaving clients. An API key is about the simplest possible way to achieve that, and appears to be perfectly adequate in this case. What do you suggest? SAML? reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparent> If the provider is bearing the costs (like here) then they always need some kind of authorization, or they have no way to shut off abusers or people with misbehaving clients.

No authentication required by default -- it's public data. Just impose a reasonable rate limit by IP address and require registration only if someone has a legitimate reason to exceed that. reply abraae 5 hours agorootparent> all the public web servers in the world seem to manage this without any trouble Incorrect. Most large web sites invest in DDOS protection e.g. Cloudflare. Cloudflare DDOS protection as an example is a lot more sophisticated than merely counting requests per source IP (https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/about/how-...). reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparentCloudflare is one of the ways they manage it. But API keys aren't any good for that anyway because if someone is just trying to overload your service by brute force, they can send requests regardless of whether the keys are valid and still use up all your bandwidth sending error responses or your CPU/memory opening new connections prior to validating the API keys, and to avoid that you'd still need some kind of DDoS protection. Where they actually do something is where you're doing accounting, because then if someone wants to send you a million requests, you don't block them, you just process them and send them a bill. Maybe you block them if they reach the point you don't expect them to be able to pay. But if it's a free service that anybody can sign up for as many times as they want then that doesn't do any good because the price is $0 and a rate limit per key is avoided by signing up for arbitrarily many more keys. reply mlhpdx 5 hours agorootparentprev> HTTP is an \"API\" that has no API keys and all the public web servers in the world seem to manage this without any trouble.

You can read this website (i.e. make queries against its database) without logging in.

Forgiving, romantic, shadowy orange gave way to cold, all-seeing bluish white. Before the late 1970s, NYC was illuminated at night by pinkish-white incandescent bulbs. When the yellow monstrosities were rolled out people almost rioted. Their harsh orange glow invaded bedrooms creeping between gaps in curtains and assaulting the eyes, destroyed the soft and warm ambiance that had set the night scene for generations, and muted all colors into a monochromatic hellscape. After just 30 seconds on TimesMachine I found an article from 1982 about the transition and how some residents were hesitant and one jurisdiction rejected the change out of hand. It took a long time for NYC to gain its orange glow and people didn't like it. https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1982/09/12/137...

It's the same principle as using the amber-hued Night Mode on your phone in the evening. I never experienced the pinkish-white, but the transition from orange to blue has been horrible for sleep. Nighttime lighting around homes should be amber, not blue. (Contrast with highways where you do want people to stay awake, so blue makes sense.) reply c0pium 7 hours agorootparentThe evidence that blue light is bad for sleep is much worse from an experimental standpoint than the evidence that it improves cognition and reaction time, which are obviously rather important considerations in street lights. Consider for instance that placebo glasses which filter the so-called harmful blue light wavelengths have been shown to fully reverse the apparent effect on sleep quality.

When I moved in with my fiancee (at the time my girlfriend), I noticed after a couple months that I had a bit of trouble sleeping due to her often falling asleep later than me and being on her laptop for a bit. Since blackout curtains don't help with that, I bought a sleep mask for a few dollars from Amazon (basically a piece of nylon fabric and a strap, nothing specialized), and it's not an exaggeration to say that it's been life-changing. As a child, I'd often struggle to fall asleep due to literally any amount of light in my bedroom, and when I was in elementary school it got bad enough that it would take me several hours of lying in bed to finally fall asleep, and I ended up getting prescribed insomnia medication that I continued taking for a couple of decades. It turned out that with the sleep mask, I was able to taper off the prescription sleeping medication within a year or so, and I'm even able to get up earlier without being quite as groggy due to my quality of sleep increasing so much. If anyone else has similar issues with lighting interfering with their sleep, especially if it's from things within their building rather than outside, I'd highly recommend investing a few bucks to try this out.

Even the old mercury-arc lights weren't that great - either sickly greenish or a color-corrected version that was blue-white. The 175W mercury-arc streetlight on my corner was replace by a 40W LED, with better lighting to boot. Low-pressure sodium is even worse - an absolute monochromatic yellow.

I don’t know about any ordinance, but you’re describing my town’s new downtown.

(And this is some firm’s same solution/plan that you can find in at least one development miles away.

My parents loved it, thought it was the pinnacle of wealth. Now you might be questioning why I dislike cherrywood. The answer doesn't actually matter though, I dislike it. Most importantly, I am not the only one. I like vinyl, because I spent a few weeks of my life (probably at most a few hours total actual wall clock hours on it) replacing flooring in a couple of rooms through a few houses. The beginning, and the rest of my answer here though, also does not matter. It only matters that I like it and will pay money for it over wood. I am also, not the only one. Gray is used for many reasons in new builds, its a neutral color, and because many builders build a house/apartment, THEN sell to customers. Very few customers buy a plot of land, contract an architect, make customizations, and then build the building. It comes with the realization that people will substitute out the things they want on their own, not requiring someone else figure out everything they like and being creative all on their behalf for $0. reply pixl97 16 hours agorootparentNo idea why you're downvoted for this, but I guess pointing out the obvious on HN makes some people mad. reply randomdata 4 hours agorootparentYou do not understand why people are pressing the \"this is correct\" button even while you recognize that the comment is stating the obvious?

I buy electronics equipment, computers, furniture, clothes, and cars with the mindset I will be the last owner of them, and they will have no resale value. “I bought this, and I will assume it’s instantly worthless” It keeps me from buying the same thing twice and causes me to save up for the thing I really want, and keep it for as long as possible. It also lets me be picky about my preferences and really scope out exactly what I want on a relaxed timeframe.

Whenever you have people trying to maximize some value they'll copy the strategy they view as most successful and other factors take a back seat. Maximizing the resale value of a home involves making it appeal to the largest number of people. Adding character risks lowering demand by appealing to niche markets. So you end up with lots of white and grey. You see similar things all over the place. Want to maximize your career? Better suppress your individuality in favor of copying how successful people speak, act, and dress. If you've ever heard the term \"TikTok Beat\" that's a similar phenomenon where the most popular music on TikTok gets copied like a meme by wannabe famous music producers. It's a process that ends up with bland results as variety is reduced over time. It's also dehumanizing as humanity is slowly stripped away due to inefficiency. reply deebosong 17 hours agorootparentTo piggyback off of this with a call-to-action against the realities you point out, I think it's absolutely valuable and worth it to go after the aesthetic things that you like even for subjective reasons, and even if prevailing trends say otherwise, at the expense of falling outside the confines of conformity for the sake of pseudo-safety. Safety in numbers is a thing, but when it comes to art & design & aesthetics, it utterly kills courage, and things are done out of fear of rejection or disapproval, which makes the end product feel bland, uninspired, forgettable, and will be dated in a few years. Might as well just explore what is interesting to you and not worry about public reception. But then that's tied into many other things like fear of rejection, fear of sticking out, fear of failure, etc., that may need to be unearthed and explored in oneself – which is utterly worthwhile and necessary to do, and by staving it off you only do yourself and others a massive disservice and continue to operate in fear. But yeah I'm making blanket statements that needs context, etc. reply pixl97 16 hours agorootparentI don't think this is the only issue. People have always copied each other throughout history. In the past before the industrial age it was much more difficult though as you had to use local materials and labor. Now we have global corporations and many of them are near monopolies in many industries. Add to this that making a billion of one thing massively drops the costs over something you make a million of, so you're far more apt to see the billion item unit on cost factors alone. Also we see lots of wildly different looking products when looking back at the past, but this is likely a lot of survivorship bias. Because they were different people kept them and tossed the common thing without regard. Lastly, I'd add in a question of how things are financed. If you're asking for a huge pile of money to make a product, it's going to be a lot easier to get it when you choose the safe and proven option then one that is riskier. reply bobthepanda 15 hours agorootparentThere is also the question of new mass media.

More complex shapes are hard to due due to the clunky spline tools. Hence elaborate ornaments are left out. reply esperent 1 hour agoparentI think this is valid, but it's only one part of the equation - and I would guess it's the smaller part. The other side is manufacturing. In an era of mass production, making things like buildings look unique is expensive. If your building is made from rectangles, lines, and few curves, you can use off the shelf panels to build it. Order them from a factory, have a truck deliver them, stick them together with cement and bolts. On the other hand, even if you do pay someone for the extra time to create beautiful, unique, complex designs in a CAD program (which is not that hard), actually making those parts is extremely expensive so they will get rejected by most architectural and construction firms. Perhaps as we come into the era of 3d printing, more complex structures will come back into vogue again.

It's not beauty, exactly. It's norms. Some places have fairly strong norms. If you own a plot of land (perhaps with an old building) in such a place and go to an architect ask for a proposal to renovate/rebuild/whatever, the architect will tell you clearly what you'll be permitted to build and what not. In such a place, your new building will look rather like its neighbours. Unless you want to try to fight the building commission, maybe you think the voters disagree with the commission and you can force the elected officials to overrule the commission. In other places you have a lot more flexibility, and in that case you have the option to build beautifully, and you also also a lot of less beautiful options. You may think the second question is the key: Do people who hire architects and builders choose to build beautifully or not? I think the first one is the most important factor. The second matters seldom, because even when the choice is there, the choice is usually for such a small area that you can see five or ten independent buildings, and the overall effect will lack beauty even if one or two buildings are beautiful. reply jevoten 16 hours agoparentprev> (you turn off some buyers who don’t like the look) Fortunately the modernist minimal grayscale look is universally beloved, so no-one is turned off by that. reply midasuni 1 hour agorootparentBut nobody is more turned off.

Not every article is or should be targeted at convincing the resistant reader, and visual examples can be a distraction or simplification of a broader idea.

I think a lot of the complaints around ugly architecture are just matters of difference of aesthetics: I'm autistic and a have certain amount of brain damage to my vision centers and so I deal with sensory overload a lot, and so I tend to prefer interfaces and environments that are clean and simple, made of just enough shapes and colors to communicate the structure of things and that's it, with no extraneous ornamentation or gradients or whatever, so a lot of modern architecture looks fine or even nice and refreshing to me, like a glass of cool water. Meanwhile, most of the people I find complaining about this sort of thing are the typical hipsters and grouchy conservatives — both of the \"I was born too late\" variety and the \"I was literally born a long time ago\" variety — that are looking fondly on a past age just out of their own personal preferences and predilections, and probably without any real understanding of what it was like to live surrounded by overly ornate architecture all the time, which is perfectly fine for them, but then they make these Grand think pieces and statements about how things should be, which is frustrating since I would rather gouge my own eyes out then live in the world they would prefer oftentimes. reply sph 15 hours agoprevDupe from last year, 500+ comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33894679 They lied on the publication date. reply ojintoad 15 hours agoparentOdd, do you mean they lied back in 2022?

Alas, in its finished form The Josh really is yellow, and also burgundy, gray, and brown.\" The coy phrasing about \"apartments one wouldn’t want to be able to afford\" is a disguised reference to the fact that the apartments are reserved only for low-income residents; the author would not want to live in Brooklyn on the poverty-level income required to be eligible for the housing development.

So they decide to snobbily denigrate them because… (makes them feel better? some kind of psychological need to establish superiority?) Tastes change.

But what strikes me in some “ugly” cities is how accepted it is to let things be objectively ugly, for example in some cities you can see how a building wedged between two beautiful buildings has been torn down but the effort to build a new one seems on hold. As if owning the building/land gave the right to leave a scar for any amount of time. In cities where this doesn’t happen I imagine you simply don’t get a permit to leave an ugly hole.

The “problem” is, everyone has a different preference. Let’s say I like mid-century modern, and spend $75,000 extra on building (tastefully) in that style. Now it’s 10 years later and I want to sell the house. A potential buyer likes everything except the mid-century modern. Their favorite style is neoclassical. To them, mid-century modern styling has a value of zero or even -$25,000. So if I didn’t build in that style, they might have been willing to pay 75k-100k more. The paradox here is that a divergence in preferences, due to cultural atomization and the internet, has led to lower returns on investment in beauty (and atrophying of craftsmanship and the ability to build beautifully to begin with).
