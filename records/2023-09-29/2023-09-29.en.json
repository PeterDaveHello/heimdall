    "originBody": "james vaughan blog Wifi without internet on a Southwest flight September 24, 2023 I spent a recent flight finding out what I could do with a connection to the flight’s wifi, but without access to the internet. I was on my way home from Strange Loop, a direct flight from St. Louis to Oakland. It’s a long enough flight that I planned to purchase the $8 internet access and get some work done, but Southwest’s wifi portal wouldn’t accept any form of payment. The web page didn’t give me any helpful error messages, so I opened up my browser’s network dev tools to see if I could figure out what was going wrong. I found the failing request, but it didn’t provide any useful hints to point me toward a solution. While I was there, I saw another request that caught my eye: A repeating successful request for current.json. Here’s an example response from one of those requests: { \"sat_commlink_portal\": { \"status\": \"conn_ok\", \"time\": \"Sun Sep 24 22:02:19 2023\" }, \"pcent_flt_complete\": 33, \"altVal\": \"35998\", \"lon\": \"-100.755\", \"satcomm_status\": { \"commlink\": \"active\", \"linkparams\": \"not-stale\" }, \"dtzone\": \"PDT\", \"within_us\": true, \"etad\": \"06:19 PM\", \"lat\": \"40.201\", \"gspdVal\": \"487\", \"ttgc\": \"2h 25m\", \"dist_remain\": \"1167\", \"actime24\": \"15:54\" } This appeared to be the data that drives the in-flight wifi portal’s flight status page. Since this was one of the only things I could access on this network, I decided to make the most of it. I used my browser’s “Copy as cURL” feature to quickly get a command to hit the endpoint. As an aside, this feature is present in Firefox and all chromium-based browsers and it’s really handy if you ever need to reply requests made by your browser and want to send all the same headers. After some experimenting, I found that none of the cookies or headers that were included in the request were strictly necessary, meaning that I could fetch the data with a simple curl 'https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json'. I set up a loop to dump the data in a log file: watch -n 30 \"curl https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.jsonjq -c >> flight-logs\" I didn’t know what I’d do with the data at this point, but I started collecting it right away so that I’d have as much as possible to play with later. With that running, I decided to look more closely at the responses to figure out what exactly I had to work with. Here’s that same example response, annotated with my best guess at what the fields represent: { // This looks like info about the system's satellite internet connection. \"sat_commlink_portal\": { // The connection is okay! \"status\": \"conn_ok\", // I'm not sure what this time is. // It hasn't changed at all. \"time\": \"Sun Sep 24 22:02:19 2023\" }, // The percentage progress of the current flight. // I don't know if this is in terms of distance or in terms of the estimated // lenght of time. \"pcent_flt_complete\": 33, // The current altitude. \"altVal\": \"35998\", // The current coordinates. \"lat\": \"40.201\", \"lon\": \"-100.755\", // This looks like (more?) info about the system's satellite internet connection. \"satcomm_status\": { // The connection is active! \"commlink\": \"active\", // Something isn't stale! \"linkparams\": \"not-stale\" }, // This flight's destination timezone is PDT. \"dtzone\": \"PDT\", // This flight is within the US. \"within_us\": true, // Our estimated time of arrival at the destination. \"etad\": \"06:19 PM\", // Our current ground speed. \"gspdVal\": \"487\", // The estimated time remaning. Maybe \"time-to-ground-contact\"? \"ttgc\": \"2h 25m\", // The flight's remaining distance in miles. \"dist_remain\": \"1167\", // The current time in some time zone. \"actime24\": \"15:54\" } Most of that is straightforward, but I’m curious about a few parts: What’s the difference between sat_commlink_portal.status and satcomm_status.commlink? Is pcent_flt_complete in terms of distance or in terms of estimated time? How much with altVal, etad, and gspdVal fluctuate throughout the flight? What is the ac in actime24? I would think “aircraft”, but in this case that time is the current time in our destination, not the current time in the aircraft’s location. I spent the flight working on some scripts that could visualize some of the data after I finished collecting it. Here’s what I came up with: Change in altitude over time Going into this, I was mostly curious to see how noisy the altitude data would be. It’s difficult to see the noise with such a large range. Here’s the same data, but with the plane’s descent removed: According to this data, the plane’s altitude was only fluctuating by about 20-30 feet. This is more stable than I expected! I had assumed that I’d see a lot more change here, but I don’t know what’s normal and I don’t know how accurate this data is. Change in ETA over time I predicted that this would be reasonably stable, and it was. This was a pretty smooth flight, at least after the initial departure. I’m curious what this would have looked like if we had a delayed landing due to weather. Would the reported ETA slowly creep up as the airline’s confidence in the delay increased, or would it spike up sharply near the end? Change in ground speed over time This was also stable, as expected. edit: I originally labeled these speeds as MPH, but some HN readers helpfully pointed out that these are more likely to be knots. I wish I had started collecting the data earlier in the flight. I’m curious to see shape of this curve as we approached cruising speed. I didn’t find anything particularly useful or surprising here, but this was a fun way to spend the flight! Discuss this post here on Hacker News or shoot me an email!",

I said, \"son, how are you using the internet?\" He said, \"oh, a kid at school showed me - if you go here\" (he opened up the wifi settings where the DHCP assigned IP address is) \"and start changing the numbers, eventually the internet will work.\" Apparently, at the time, on American Airlines, when somebody bought and paid for an internet plan, it gave them an IP address and authorized it to use the internet... if somebody else guessed your IP address (which was pretty easy, it was a 192.168 address) and spoofed it, they could take over your internet connection with no further authorization.I had to tell him not to do that, but I was kind of proud of him for having the temerity to go for it. reply pak9rabid 15 hours agoparentlol, I used to do this all the time at non-free wifi hotspot locations, only I&#x27;d start off with a ping sweep of the entire subnet (nmap -sP) in order to get my ARP cache filled with a bunch of potential usable IP&#x2F;mac addresses on the network. From there, I&#x27;d iterate through each one and set the IP & mac address until I found one that would let me through the firewall.Granted, being a NOC engineer at Wayport (now AT&T WiFi) certainly helped me understand how it all works. reply aeternum 14 hours agorootparentYes the key to doing this more seamlessly is to spoof both the IP and the MAC so your machines are not constantly fighting with the other person over the ARP table entry. reply colanderman 12 hours agorootparentAren&#x27;t you then fighting the switch&#x27;s port learning? Or RSTing each other&#x27;s TCP connections? reply withinboredom 12 hours agorootparentIts wifi. You both just pick up the same frame when it is broadcast, then it sees two stations (a level below IP) with the same MAC. Most routers just don&#x27;t care about that. (it&#x27;s technically a valid edge case that two stations have the same mac address. It should be vanishingly rare in the wild ... but this is a practical example of why it isn&#x27;t). reply richardwhiuk 12 hours agorootparentIf there&#x27;s multiple hotspots behind the same controller, you may well get switch port fighting. reply withinboredom 11 hours agorootparentIf STP[1] is enabled, but that is unlikely since you&#x27;d have dropped connections when roaming for the reasons you just gave. Most likely, STP is not enabled on these networks.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spanning_Tree_Protocol reply cereal_cable 3 hours agorootparentA switched port learns the Mac address for packets sent into it. If port 1 sends a packet with Mac a, the switch associates that address (a) to port 1. When another node sends a packet onto another port with the same mac, say on port 2, the switch will move the learned address a to port 2 and remove it from port 1.When a switch has learned a mac address all traffic destined to that traffic would be immediately switched to that port. If the switch has no record for that specific mac address it floods all ports except the ingress port. This is expensive and means other devices receive traffic that isn&#x27;t intended for them so they waste time dropping it.So in networks that have no protections against those attacks then this could very well be a problem if there are multiple access points and the two nodes are on different access points. reply withinboredom 1 hour agorootparentExcept that this is a normal thing on wireless networks. A station may roam many times within a few minutes, and due to reflections, may even be in more than one place at a time. replylondons_explore 12 hours agorootparentprevUsually doesn&#x27;t matter... The other person will get frustrated and disconnect and reconnect a few times, and finally give up and read a book... reply daveevad 10 hours agorootparent> The other person will get frustrated and disconnect and reconnect a few times, and finally give up and read a book...That makes me really reconsider my past struggles with this form of Internet access. reply cutemonster 53 minutes agorootparentTime to consider instead: walk through the plane, look angrily at the other passengers, one at a time, asking: \"Do you use 192.168.x.y?\". That can solve the problem reply Arrath 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah... replyshredprez 14 hours agorootparentprevI typically just praise with upvotes, but I’m feeling grateful today: anecdotes like this one and gp are why I love hn reply LtWorf 1 hour agorootparentprevNormally ping is disabled on those networks? reply zikohh 12 hours agorootparentprevRecommended any blog posts? reply sprokolopolis 13 hours agoparentprevI used to do this on airplanes and in hotels. I had more success in hotels, because there was less chance the other person was using it at the time and less chance of getting kicked off.There was another little hack that I used as a little kid. Remember when airlines would sell or rent special headphones to watch inflight movies? The port was just two holes beside each other and the plug was two tubes. Before a flight, I would stop by one of the fast food places in the terminal and grab a handful of straws (preferably ones with a bendy joint). When I was on the plane I would connect the straws by fitting them into each other to create a long straw. Put one end into the port on and the other into your ear and you got free movies with audio! reply barrkel 27 minutes agorootparentHow long ago was this?20 years ago, all I saw were dual mono bayonet jacks you&#x27;d need an adapter for to plug in normal headphones, but straws would get you nowhere.I was curious so I searched: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleflying.com&#x2F;inflight-entertainment-headphones-e... - pneumatic headphones from the 1960s were used on Delta as late as 2003, but electronic headsets debuted on 767 in 1982.Apparently the dual mono jacks are to discourage people taking the headphones, rather than restricting access to audio. reply lxgr 14 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s an amazing anecdote!The state of \"open Wi-Fi\" security is actually really sad. I&#x27;m not aware of an easy way for the airline to actually do better than this!I suppose they could use Opportunistic Wireless Encryption [1] and bind session authentication to that (i.e. authenticate a given OWE session, not a given MAC address) if the device supports it, as at least modern Apple devices do? But I have no idea how stable an OWE session is; it would be very inconvenient to have to login again every time my device switches between access points.In any case, I&#x27;m sad that this isn&#x27;t a solved problem yet, and paid Wi-Fi (as well as securing free Wi-Fi) still requires custom and clunky solutions like unreliable captive portals that need to pass through selective traffic (e.g. for 3DS, for payments, sometimes emails for password reset codes etc and more).A standardized endpoint and API would also be nice, i.e. something to tell the client whether it&#x27;s connected, restricted (i.e. able to only access a limited set of hosts such as the in-flight map as described in the article), or needs to pay&#x2F;authenticate (and if so, at which URL). This could then yield an authentication token, to be provided for seamless reconnections for the same session.There&#x27;s \"Hotspot 2.0\" and WPA-EAP (i.e. WPA Enterprise), but these don&#x27;t really have a good story for \"pay via web portal\" style usages and are more geared towards wireless carrier operated hotspot networks and corporate scenarios, respectively.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Opportunistic_Wireless_Encrypt... reply Nextgrid 14 hours agorootparentIn cases where the Wi-Fi is provided as a value-add or is bought via another channel than the Wi-Fi network itself, I think you can just generate one-time WPA Enterprise credentials, with a QR code to facilitate data entry?In case of in-flight Wi-Fi, the credentials&#x2F;QR code can be printed on the boarding pass, or available in the app (the app caches it in advance while it&#x27;s still on the ground, so when in the air you can use those credentials to connect).This doesn&#x27;t cover 100% of use-cases but it would at least cover a big one (a significant amount of public Wi-Fi is \"value add\" to another service - whether restaurants, hotels, flights, etc where there&#x27;s an existing channel to provide one-off wi-Fi credentials over), it&#x27;s a shame nobody deploys this. reply labcomputer 13 hours agorootparentI think you could even take this one step further: Have a captive portal on an unencrypted channel (using TLS obviously) to do the vending, so that the credentials don’t need to be purchased before the flight. reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentOh, these are neat ideas, I hadn’t thought of that!One concern might be expiring access credentials (not sure if most OSes will re-prompt for a new password or just give up), but you could just make the EAP credentials per-user instead and redirect users to the captive portal again once needed.This leaves clients not supporting WPA-EAP, but these could just continue using the regular unencrypted&#x2F;MAC-authenticated service. reply MBCook 7 hours agorootparentYou might be able to just do the sign up on the in-flight entertainment system and have the user scan the resulting WR code.Only works with IFE equipped planes, of course. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentWell, the customer also needs to futz around with scanning a WR code, and get it from the device she scanned it on to the device she wants to use the wifi on (if they ain&#x27;t the same.)Though you could route around these problems, but giving them both a scannable code, and underneath some credentials as plain text they could type. replycxcorp 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat if the captive portal just had a link (or on an IFE screen, a QR code) that connected your phone to a different, WPA2&#x2F;WPA3 protected, hidden WiFi SSID that was generated exclusively for you? Phones nowadays support joining a passphrase protected WiFi AP via a QR code, so I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;s doable. The hard part would be finding routers that support >300 different hidden SSIDs, but honestly I would hope that that is technically feasible nowadays.That way you&#x27;d at least have the protection of the WPA GTK. reply tharkun__ 11 hours agorootparentThis. And even if the >300 is not available, how many people actually buy Wi-Fi on the plane? That is the number of clients that need to be supported. And if that&#x27;s still a problem (or you don&#x27;t want to guess), the SSID can be hidden and static and the only thing non-static is the password that works for just the duration of the flight you are on. reply tpolzer 4 hours agorootparentprevThe AP still has to send regular beacons for each hidden SSID, taking up air time. reply pbhjpbhj 10 hours agorootparentprevSo you just take a photo of anyone&#x27;s QR code? I&#x27;m not sure the hidden SSID achieves anything, that is presumably plaintext in the wi-fi transmission? reply eru 5 hours agorootparentThat QR code would only be displayed for a short time, and mostly only people sitting directly behind you could snap the picture.It&#x27;s not airtight, but better than the system it would be replacing. reply vezuchyy 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can always use an open network to generate passwords for the proper internet connected WPA-EAP network (along with some in-flight multimedia like some carriers do). Extra step for sure but it solves the problem.PS: I&#x27;m a couch expert so I have no idea if there&#x27;s a problem with this idea. reply Wowfunhappy 10 hours agorootparentThe first problem that comes to my mind--clients will remember both wifi networks and may continue to choose the open network when e.g. waking from sleep.The user can go in and forget the open network of course, but most won&#x27;t know to do that. reply stereo 6 hours agorootparentIt would theoretically be possible to bounce clients which you know are already authorised on the paid network. reply IggleSniggle 6 hours agorootparentprevUse Bluetooth instead of WiFi for the password generation channel reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentprevYou could just prevent access to the wider internet on the open version! reply Wowfunhappy 10 hours agorootparentYes but the client will still connect and the user will wonder why their internet isn&#x27;t working. reply dangus 12 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t this data meant to be exposed? You can get all this flight status on the Southwest intranet when you’re connected to WiFi as part of the flight status page.This hack just goes a step further to plot the data over time. reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentThe concern isn’t access to the flight status data (or even your data, which is most likely encrypted these days), but theft of service you paid for, by another passenger on the flight (you would probably at least get kicked out&#x2F;experience issues with your own connectivity, and might worst-case be blamed if something bad happens using the connection you bought). reply dangus 7 hours agorootparentI’m confused, none of what you’re describing is part of the article. reply nenaoki 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s responding to the scenario described in GGP. replykxrm 15 hours agoparentprevA few years ago I was on a Southwest flight and had OpenVPN running because I forgot to turn it off. I was able to access the Internet through my tunnel without paying for access. I guess at the time they were only port blocking common ports (80, 443, 53 etc) if you didn&#x27;t pay. They have since closed that hole. reply chankstein38 14 hours agorootparentFor this same reason you used to be able to send messages via platforms like whatsapp without internet as well! I don&#x27;t remember the airline I just remember I hadn&#x27;t paid for internet but I could message and do a few other things but I couldn&#x27;t browse the internet. reply thedanbob 14 hours agorootparentThat was probably deliberate. I flew United recently and they advertised free wifi for certain messaging apps, or you could pay to access more apps or the general internet. reply MostlyStable 13 hours agorootparentI also flew united recently and, in addition to the free messaging access, they also provided free access to the inflight entertainment, in case you wanted to watch it on your device instead of on the screen.I would have loved to take advantage of this since my wireless earbuds were significantly better than the wired pair I had. Unfortunately, a little pop-up warned me that this was not available on Android 13 devices. I was more than a little annoyed, but also curious as to why this might have been the case. reply kshacker 9 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s my hack for United&#x27;s free messaging. Works on iOS, and makes the flight more useful than before, but not as good as paid internet.Messaging and Notifications basically follow the same protocol. Even though I usually have notifications disabled, I go and activate it for anything I care about - News, Weather, Slack, Whatsapp (yes I have that silenced). Every single message pops up as a notification. Could be bank alert, Ring alert, homekit alert, whatever ... it just shows. So you can keep tab on things you care about, and if you are really needed, well you can pay and get on the full Wifi. And anyways you can iMessage to communicate if needed. reply alwayslikethis 11 hours agorootparentprevI flew United recently, and I was able to use the free messaging service for basically everything without any intervention from my part. It&#x27;s just a tad slow. Not sure if it was intended or not. reply xattt 13 hours agorootparentprevThere was a report in the early to mid-2000s where someone got iChat AV to work, partly because it was fairly obscure and likely the network engineers didn’t consider blocking it. reply bayindirh 2 hours agorootparentprevIf it&#x27;s Turksih Airlines, they also provide unlimited messaging on board, free of charge. reply Kikawala 14 hours agorootparentprevIt also worked on Alaska Airlines and American Airlines. reply cromka 2 hours agoparentprevThere’s a way to workaround virtually any kind of gated Internet access: DNS tunneling (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yarrick&#x2F;iodine)It’s slow, but it works and is a handy “last resort” tool. reply josh_carterPDX 14 hours agoparentprevThere used to be an app that would scan the ip and mac addresses on the network that were already connected to the internet. You could then change your settings to one of the mac addresses and when they were done you&#x27;d get the connection to yourself.I used to travel a lot for work and just refused to pay for WiFi. This was good in airports and coffeeshops when you still had to pay to connect.Now it&#x27;s hardly needed, but I could see how it would be helpful where there&#x27;s still a cost to connect. reply cromka 2 hours agorootparentIt’s not an app, per se, but a concept of setting your WiFi card into monitor mode and listening to the radio traffic. Kismet is one of the suites that does that. reply smfjaw 14 hours agoparentprevLove stuff like this, it&#x27;s how kids get into computers. I used to make minecraft servers for my friends and I to play on when I was 12, which lead to a software engineering career.

The airline could easily assign a unique IP address to each seat (ticket) without using DHCP.This is generally in contrast to other instances of public Wifi. reply grishka 10 hours agorootparentWhat if someone has multiple devices they want to connect? Most people would travel with at least two devices. reply ValentineC 6 hours agorootparentFor Panasonic&#x27;s in-flight wifi specifically, a login would only work for one device at a time.Great time to have an Android device with hotspot handy. :) reply hunter2_ 5 hours agorootparentThe fact that newer phones (Pixel at least) can use WiFi (client mode) as the WAN&#x2F;uplink side of its hotspot stack (NAT, AP, etc.) is pretty neat. Not long ago, only the cell modem could serve in that capacity, as far as I&#x27;m aware. Frankly I&#x27;m surprised a single WLAN radio can pull that off. I pay the $8 on my phone and share it to my laptop and whatever devices my travel companion(s) might have.Most laptops can&#x27;t do this, right? reply grishka 4 hours agorootparent> Frankly I&#x27;m surprised a single WLAN radio can pull that off.Maybe at the cost of latency because it has to switch channels back and forth?> Most laptops can&#x27;t do this, right?Any laptop can do this if you plug a USB WiFi dongle into it :P reply avidiax 2 hours agorootparent> Maybe at the cost of latency because it has to switch channels back and forth?Not necessarily. It can be a client on 2.4Ghz and an access point on 5Ghz. Even without that, if it has MIMO, then one of the antennas can be receiving 2.4Ghz while the other is sending (at least in theory, if the crosstalk between the antennas is low and the selectivity of the receiver is sufficient). reply cromka 2 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn’t have to switch channels, it will create another station using same channel. replygroby_b 11 hours agorootparentprevGood luck finding out which seat that wireless connection is coming from, though :) reply hunter2_ 5 hours agorootparentThe user would scan their boarding pass to get connected. reply noduerme 1 hour agoparentprevWait, they like, opened up a private local IP on every plane for some guy who paid for a certain dedicated one?! reply afterburner 13 hours agoparentprev> for having the temerity to go for itWell, if he doesn&#x27;t know there&#x27;s anything wrong with it, it&#x27;s not really temerity. reply hunter2_ 5 hours agorootparentI think kids sense wrongness even when the act is deemed victimless, repercussionless, etc. -- it&#x27;s pretty clear that a thing was achieved that someone tried to prevent, and undermining someone&#x27;s effort is typically wrong.

A lot of gated wifi networks allow SSH traffic through without payment.I used to spend a lot of time at JFK back when they still charged for WiFi. I watched a lot of Netflix for free by just logging into my router and opening a tunnel to my VPN server. reply Wowfunhappy 10 hours agorootparentDo you know why they let SSH through? reply jrockway 9 hours agorootparentThe rule is probably something like \"if !paid: deny tcp 80, deny tcp 443\". (Hopefully they got UDP for HTTP&#x2F;3.) I suppose this has the desired effect of captive portals (break GMail until you pay), without having to field support requests from geeks (\"I paid but SSH doesn&#x27;t work, refund me\"). I think their plan is that whatever obscure app you&#x27;re using negotiates over HTTPS, but then actually transfers the data over some other port. I bet things like Zoom work that way. By not touching the obscure data paths, you avoid support requests.Either that, or they just felt like throwing a fellow nerd a bone. If you ask the PM, \"should I block SSH\" they&#x27;ll say yes, but if you just put it in there, who knows ;) reply Eumenes 12 hours agoparentprev9-10 seems young to have a phone, smart kid though reply eru 5 hours agorootparentThe older generation had Game Boys at that age, too. reply KMnO4 15 hours agoparentprevI used to do the same thing at hotels. Still often works. nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-255To find everyone on the network, then start spoofing each of their MACs until you find one that works reply savrajsingh 15 hours agorootparentI should probably know the answer, but what happens when two devices have the same MAC address? reply AdamJacobMuller 15 hours agorootparent\"it depends, nothing good\"Network devices forward (switch, more technically) packets to and end device based on an internal MAC table (send packets for DE:AD:BE:EF to interface ge-0&#x2F;0&#x2F;0.0) and most devices populate their MAC table simply by looking at input packets and sending the \"next\" packet for that MAC address out the \"last\" received interface.If two devices in a network have the same MAC address, they will effectively \"fight\" for control of the packet flow. You can win that fight by sending a lot of packets.In practice, the other person is going to get annoyed and give up.There are lots of technology which avoid this issue now, but the two primary ones are 802.1x (used in corporate&#x2F;government environments) and DHCP snooping which can be much more broadly deployed. 802.1x is very complicated and I won&#x27;t go into it, but, DHCP snooping works by limiting L2 forwarding (MAC table population) to only what the DHCP server says the end device should have and it does this just by inspecting the DHCP replies (no custom protocol) with some vendor specific extensions on the DHCP server side for complex scenarios (you can even do things like put ports in a specific VLAN based on the DHCP reply).This works fine on a physical layer and most hotels are probably using something similar now (less for malicious abusive reasons, though that&#x27;s a thing) but also just to work around poorly behaving devices and to reduce customer complaints. If you care (and have a modest amount of money) MAC and IP spoofing are dead on the physical layer.For the wifi layer, very similar stuff exists in high-end gear (Rukus&#x2F;Cisco) and is starting to trickle down to prosumer level gear like unifi. If you care (and have serious cash for Rukus) MAC and IP spoofing are also dead on the wifi layer. reply EvanAnderson 13 hours agorootparent> \"it depends, nothing good\"Fun anecdote from the early 2000&#x27;s re: duplicate MACs:Embedded IP time clock kept intermittently barfing out frames with the source MAC addresses of other devices on the network.

Many of the replies are losing that detail and thinking of how it would effect a 1000base-T network, which maps MAC addresses to specific ports.For a broadcast network, the answer could be &#x27;nothing&#x27; in the sense that both receivers would get the same traffic. The IP stack would then throw away packets destined for the other computer unless they were UDP broadcast or multicast, and even then it would only notice if someone was running Wireshark.Advanced wifi devices&#x2F;meshes will use beam forming and mesh allocation and might degrade if there were MAC duplicates, but I think they will generally operate in a non-exclusive basis due to end point movement and fading, so both computers will get a good data rate.In summary: it&#x27;s fine. reply colanderman 12 hours agorootparentCan&#x27;t this often result in the two machines RSTing each others&#x27; TCP connections, depending on firewall settings? reply commandlinefan 15 hours agorootparentprevNo way to tell for sure, but I can only assume that he had actually hijacked somebody else&#x27;s connection and the other person&#x27;s device stopped working for them.

One way or another, the packet destined for the person you&#x27;re spoofing will end up at your computer and work its way through the layers. From there, if it&#x27;s a TCP&#x2F;IP packet, I think it&#x27;ll get filtered out at Layer 4 (transport) because your computer wasn&#x27;t one of the parties that initiated the TCP connection (the sequence numbers won&#x27;t line up, etc).Packets being broadcast to multiple machines is common enough in various network setups, it&#x27;s up to the individual machine to decide whether to process or drop the packet. reply sznio 12 hours agorootparentprevSince Wi-Fi is a broadcast medium, shouldn&#x27;t it not matter?

Other encoders have 10 ft resolution but 25 ft is very common. reply jjwiseman 15 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t know what sensors are feeding the API from the post, but most passenger jets do broadcast information about the accuracy of their sensed position, including vertical position&#x2F;altitude.

That&#x27;s what feeds all aviation altitude data... i.e. anytime you see the word &#x27;altitude&#x27; and its not qualified with &#x27;GPS altitude&#x27; which is effectively not normally used. ADS-B Out concurrently transmits GPS height about the ellipsoid data as well as pressure altitude data. No use is normally made of the GPS height data. We are discussing pressure altitude data here, that&#x27;s what aviation works off of. The accuracy and reliability metrics in the ADS-B broadcast you are referencing refers to the GPS data not the pressure transducer&#x2F;encoder data. In cases of encoder failure being detected a flag is broadcast and the pressure aka baro altitude data field is set to all 0. ADS-B cannot give information about the pressure altitude accuracy or reliability like it does for GPS metrics. It relies on the encoders being better than their +&#x2F;- 125&#x27; accuracy requirement and that&#x27;s tested for periodically. ADS-B can in principle broadcast 100&#x27; or 25&#x27; resolution encoders, that info is in the messages. The ones here will be 25&#x27;.

It was interesting to see that their tracking was precise enough for them to chime in. reply yread 15 hours agoparentprevI guess they got a lot more precise with implementation of Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) - planes had to be separated by 2000 ft and this was reduced in early 2000s to 1000ft reply ceejayoz 15 hours agorootparentIt was probably fairly precise already. To get their license, a private pilot must demonstrate via a checkride the ability to stay within 100 feet of an assigned altitude, even in a steep turn. reply wkipling 14 hours agorootparentNot quite how it works.These are the instruments we are referring to not the ability of pilots. In fact in RVSM airspace the autopilot must be used.Instruments must be very accurate given the reduced separation in RVSM airspace. Often on modern aircraft multiple altimeters are compared and voted to provide a single output provided to the displays and autopilot. reply ceejayoz 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s missing the point.If a human can manage to keep it within 100 feet of a desired altitude, an autopilot most certainly can; it didn&#x27;t require new technology in the 2000s. Autopilots in the 1960s&#x2F;1970s weren&#x27;t seesawing all over the skies. reply sokoloff 12 hours agorootparentRVSM is overwhelmingly about instrumentation accuracy and precision, not pilot capability. [0]The pressure difference between 5K MSL and 10K MSL at standard conditions is 14.6 kPa.The pressure difference between 30K MSL and 35K MSL at ISA is 6.3 kPa.For a given amount of aircraft-to-aircraft variability in their precision altitude sensing equipment, the resulting difference in actual altitude is more than double in RVSM airspace than in the lower altitude range above.That&#x27;s the reason for RVSM: there is less change in pressure with change in altitude, coupled with a very busy altitude range (such that controllers would have an operational need to pass traffic overhead with only vertical separation rather than being able to use vectoring to achieve lateral separation between aircraft).It&#x27;s not a linear relationship, but if I take an airplane with a 0.75 kPa absolute error in one direction and pass traffic with a 0.75 kPa absolute error in the other direction 1000&#x27; indicated above them, at low altitude, that 1.5 kPa total error is a little over 500 feet while IFR-IFR separation is 1000 feet minimum outside of RVSM. (These aircraft would likely be right on the border of passing a non-RVSM static system check.)If I take those same two aircraft into the mid flight levels and pass one over the other at 30K and 31K feet, the total error is around 1200 feet, which is why non-RVSM aircraft cannot be separated by 1000 feet in RVSM airspace, because you don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;ll miss each other.Improve the accuracy and precision of the static system and improve the examination criteria, making the airplane RVSM-capable, and now you can pass that traffic over each other at 1000&#x27; of indicated separation and be sure they&#x27;ll miss.[0] - There is a pilot training requirement, which is focused on knowing the rules for RVSM and does not involve a checkride. reply ceejayoz 11 hours agorootparentStill missing the point.You’re talking about getting different aircraft to agree between each other.The post upthread expressed surprise at an aircraft maintaining a steady altitude to within tens of feet. That’s been a thing for many decades. reply sokoloff 8 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re at least partially missing the point.For autopilots servo&#x27;d to pressure altitude, holding altitude to within 0.02 kPa is more difficult than holding altitude to within 0.05 kPa or to within 0.30 kPa (which is roughly the private pilot checkride standard as-tested).Modern autopilots are actually better at holding altitude to a very tight tolerance than ancient, analog autopilots. Both can hold standards well within the PPL ACS. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparent> holding altitude to within 0.02 kPa is more difficult than holding altitude to within 0.05 kPa or to within 0.30 kPa\"more\" difficult is obviously true, but the difficulty of holding an altitude is only a small part of the overall difficulty of RSVM.In other words, RSVM is much more about accuracy than precision, and the claim was that planes were \"probably fairly precise already\".

When altitudes are not that accurate, there is a higher chance it being just a near miss. The solution, I think, was to simply avoid round numbers.

But, they do work. reply MBCook 7 hours agorootparentNot necessarily. All this could be reported up to airline HQ through the satellite link and then the IFE&#x2F;customer WiFi could be downloading it again to serve locally.That would prevent any need for direct connection between the systems.Is that how it works?

Can&#x27;t do anything to it if there&#x27;s no wires in the direction you want. Can&#x27;t remotely hack if there&#x27;s nothing antenna connected that can talk to flight control. It has the luxury of not needing to do the \"limited RCE\" that is a modern web request reply inopinatus 10 hours agorootparentIn the article above, in-flight wifi has an API reporting position, altitude, and velocity. That is a feed from avionics, which renders the claim of airgapped systems essentially null. reply nucleardog 9 hours agorootparentThey could, for the sake of a ridiculous but clear example, have a display hooked up to the avionics and a camera hooked up to a separate computer which reads the values.There are various ways of connecting systems while physically guaranteeing one way data flow—a fiber optic link with the transmitter removed from one end and the receiver removed from the other is basically a less silly “camera pointed at a display” and used in the real world.You could argue the exact semantics of “air gapped”, but for the discussion here that’s accomplishing the same thing. The fact that the passenger network has some visibility into the avionics network is not, in and of itself, any indication of an issue. reply hattmall 6 hours agorootparentprevThe plane has a transponder that reports this information to the ground, ATC, other aircraft etc. The infotainment server has a receiver that gets this data. Or in some cases they instead pull it from a ground based service via the internet. The transponder is not able to receive signals, so it is air gapped. reply inopinatus 4 hours agorootparentA quick review of published information reveals this claim as false. A typical airliner FMS feeds information to IFE via gateway devices. The integration is intended to be one-way. Airgapped they are not.Such analytical delusions are the first step on the road to failing to adequately mitigate threats. As practiced by “it can’t happen here” school of fucking up.Fortunately, it seems far more likely that aircraft system designers do not rely on any such assumption, and practice defence in depth.

I wonder if Delta&#x27;s fleet includes other things that have matching APIs to this one.

If they diverge you have bigger problems than a JSON schema.Is there a variant of this for ships? surfaceSpeed vs seaFloorSpeed? reply temp365984365 1 hour agorootparentWell, ships have apparent wind vs real wind and apparent course vs real course (currents and drift are a thing). reply wasmitnetzen 12 hours agorootparentprevA train can easily run in a head- or tailwind in the same order of magnitude as its groundspeed. reply skykooler 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been tempted to mount a small anemometer to my car - by subtracting the groundspeed from the measured airspeed, one can get the wind speed and direction and figure out whether there is a headwind or tailwind and if so how strong. Theoretically this could be used to drive more efficiently, though the extra drag from the anemometer would probably cancel out any gains. reply mulmen 9 hours agorootparentprevWow I got HN’ed twice in one thread.

I bet something in Android didn&#x27;t work properly until they whitelisted some Google domains — for example, maybe it didn&#x27;t detect the Internet connection when the user paid for it, or maybe something on the entertainment tablets broke (I don&#x27;t know if they usually run Android or something else). reply bpye 7 hours agorootparentThis seems likely. ~6 years ago on a Delta flight I noticed that I could use Google and view cached pages without paying for WiFi.

Call it \"Foo discounted\" if the plane&#x27;s SSID is \"Foo\". Put up a captive portal that lets the user claim various \"discounts\", like veteran, senior, child, etc. No matter what they choose, charge them $2 via a payment page. Once you&#x27;ve been made whole on the service cost, future visitors get a notice that \"all discounts have been claimed, please use Foo\".Now you have free internet and all those using your router&#x2F;portal have $2 internet. The upstream bandwidth is certainly atrocious so you will easily be able to multiplex all the data onto your connection.Bundle it into a RPi kind of device (has to look finished, like a music player or smth, to get past security) so that you can continue to operate the device even when tray tables have to go up, when you go to the bathroom, etc.I find it extremely doubtful that the airplane has WIPS or WIDS that will deassociate connections to your rogue wifi. And after all, are you not allowed to have a LAN party? reply not2b 16 hours agoprevBut SouthWest will give you a much prettier display of that same data (track your flight, see the current altitude and ETA, and a lot more, like the plane&#x27;s position on the map) without paying for their WiFi.

The only other explanation I can think of is you&#x27;re too stupid to not see A or B. reply Biganon 54 minutes agorootparentWell first of all I was 15 or 16 at the time, so I guess I didn&#x27;t give it as much though as you currently do, and besides, Che Guevara is (to me at least) not a symbol of communism first and foremost, but a symbol of a man fighting for his ideas (not saying that&#x27;s my opinion of him especially nowadays, I&#x27;m talking about the symbolic power, especially of the famous photograph we all know).So... no.Besides, it was in Europe. Us Europeans do not have the same epidermic reaction to communism that Americans have. reply mongol 21 minutes agorootparentYou are surprising me. Where do you live? Many Europeans have lived under communism for decades, and repulse it as nothing else. reply bonoboTP 19 minutes agorootparentprevThe parts of Europe that lived under communism (so from East Germany eastward) have a much more negative view of communism than Americans for whom it was a theoretical, faraway geopolitical issue, which they never experienced.Still, around 20 years ago when I was a teen, some edgy kids did wear Che and Marx t-shirts and it was considered cool in some circles. I&#x27;d say it is an imitation of the West. As paradoxical as it sounds, since communism is seen as edgy and cool in Western Europe, the kids in Eastern Europe who want to seem in-the-know and up-to-date had to copy it. But it was indirect in this way, it didn&#x27;t grow out of the Eastern European experience. reply boffinAudio 48 minutes agorootparentprevChe Guevara was responsible for the murder of an awful lot of innocent human beings. That fact is lost on the edge lords who want to worship him as a saviour of mankind. He was far, far from that. reply drt5b7j 42 minutes agorootparentprev> Besides, it was in Europe.

Eastern Europeans very much do have a bad allergic reaction to communism, just like Americans, and just like everyone else who came in contact with it. Che was at best a useful idiot. reply rvnx 38 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s true that in Western Europe it&#x27;s fine to show the communist symbols.To Westerner, they never saw communism in action, only propaganda.Which means that kids can proudly wear their capitalistic-made Che Guevara t-shirt at school.However, in Eastern Europe it&#x27;s an absolute no, wearing such shirts is worse than the nazi symbolsbecause it shows support to extreme atrocities in front of people who were victim of them. reply mongol 18 minutes agorootparentIt is fine in certain circles only. We are many that think it is completely insane, but we acknowledge that we live in a democracy with freedom of opinion. reply bonoboTP 12 minutes agorootparentprev> However, in Eastern Europe it&#x27;s an absolute no, wearing such shirts is worse than the nazi symbolsAs a Hungarian, this is just not true. The Western view of communism has been imported and the more time goes on, the more the younger generations base their views on what&#x27;s cool in the West vs what their old and uncool grandparents blabber on about.With the Internet and media and travel options and exchange semesters etc. the Western European attitude is diffusing into the east as well. It was already cool to wear Che t shirts 20 years ago in Budapest. Though of course Budapest has always been a West oriented cosmopolitan liberal city, so copying the west in this is not so surprising. jraph 23 minutes agorootparentprevCommunism refers to at least two things, though (in Western Europe).- a theoretical economic model that is opposed to capitalism- the atrocious regimes of the 20th century calling themselves communism you are referring to that have vanishingly few things to do with the first.Vanishingly few people in Western Europe support these atrocious regimes. And therefore, communism the way you are using it. What&#x27;s more, there&#x27;s not much propaganda for communism here (I believe there was propaganda in the past, though). The confusion is usually here and people mostly don&#x27;t see communism with a good eye because of the confusion (or because they are knowledgeable and oppose the theory - which is a better reason to be against it). Now, it&#x27;s true that we have weaker feeling about it than in the US (and, I guess, the parts of the words that suffered from the atrocious regimes).(The usual response to this is that theoretical communism invariably leads to these atrocious regimes, but I believe we don&#x27;t know this - invariably, it seems they&#x27;ve been set up by possibly sadist assholes with huge egos and thirsts for power, we haven&#x27;t tried without - as well as we don&#x27;t know if it would work. I don&#x27;t have any further useful point to make in this discussion so I probably won&#x27;t engage in it.) reply jraph 55 minutes agorootparentprevIf the person with the t-shirt is both sympathetic to communism or the Che, and RMS, I can see how it can not be a provocation.RMS was probably right not to sign it though. I also believe producing a t-shirt with RMS depicted as the Che is not quite right. reply rvnx 42 minutes agorootparentThere is some soft irony that the t-shirt depicting Stallman supporting \"revolution\" is made in China and coming from Aliexpress.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;1005005081587056.html reply drt5b7j 53 minutes agorootparentprevOf course the person with T-shirt is sympathetic to communism and RMS, but their sympathy to RMS is very superficial. Otherwise they would know that RMS wouldn&#x27;t approve. So it&#x27;s option 2 I guess. reply jraph 50 minutes agorootparentIntent matters. It&#x27;s only a provocation if it&#x27;s meant to be a provocation.Otherwise it&#x27;s mere faux-pas, at worst.What&#x27;s more, you don&#x27;t necessarily know everything about a person.

I am not sure how many young people successfully penetrate these sorts of greybeard cultures, even if they want to. reply KennyBlanken 15 minutes agorootparentThe FSF was already irrelevant thanks to decades of Stallman&#x27;s wildly antisocial behavior in person and online - and his uncompromising, unpragmatic positions all around.The comments here are hilariously praising him for all he&#x27;s done while others are lamenting how many \"battlegrounds\" have been lost and how much we need him still - cloud computing, IoT, personal computing, mobile computing. Which is it?The truth is: RMS is a failure. He was right about some things, certainly, but his inability to find compromise, see the value in incremental progress, engage in perspective-taking...all resulted in him being nearly completely ineffectual as a leader. He&#x27;s largely regarded as irrelevant extremist who just alienates or bewilders people.Then FSF pissed off the majority of the open source world by petulantly supporting RMS, even when story after story of his abusive behavior came out and their support of him was costing them funding and partnerships, endangering the organization&#x27;s health.He&#x27;s literally a poster child for nearly every kind of shitty behavior by men in the tech scene. Off the top of my head:* Being such a prolific harasser of women in his office building that women newly arriving into the building were warned about him and told to fill their offices with houseplants (which he hates.) There are also photos of people in underwear lounging on bare mattresses in his office, apparently a common occurrence.* A long history of singling out any women in audiences when he presents at a conference, and making them the subject of his virginity jokes. This was especially true if there were any girls present, which he preferred as targets for his jokes.* Telling women he&#x27;d kill himself if they wouldn&#x27;t go on a date with him* Belittling women&#x27;s contributions to open source software and conveniently forgetting about major contributors and pioneers in open source, even ones who worked on projects he supervised* Handing out \"pleasure cards\" to women at tech conferences, sexually propositioning them* Extremely disturbing comments about children and sexual consent, and doubling down* Repeatedly if not petulantly refusing to honor pronouns and other problematic behavior around trans peopleAnyone younger than boomers, aside from the doe-eyed teenagers who are also dogmatic absolutists - the sort to love Ayn Rand - definitely took notice at the FSF&#x27;s willingness to support him no matter the damage to the organization it caused. reply znpy 14 minutes agoprevWish him well, i hope he recovers fully and soon.So sad to hear this :( reply fury999io 4 hours agoprevTimestamp: 2:16 reply mid-kid 3 hours agoprevSo that&#x27;s why he was bald in the video.

Well, we do, we do. But even YouTube itself works relatively fine, and as many of you may understand, the iPad is great and much beyond what we need for kitchen, it has a loud speaker and great display, we don’t need anything else for that use-case. On top of that that’s separate device is nothing to worry about, as you may imagine controlling the iPad with dirty fingers, all the oils of the kitchen, etc. Not a place for a modern iPad that we also have, imo.For me that’s a great example. I personally know many old (even obsolete iPads) lying here and there collecting dust, as their software (and hardware) vendor decided they are all in for nature and ecology (sarcasm), so let millions of perfectly capable devices would be thrown away as a trash.Eyeing some Android tablet for that, the one I can flash with Lineage OS and be happy with. Maybe Google’s Pixel C or even Nexus 7.Meanwhile we continue using the iPad unlogginned till it stop working. reply cookiengineer 2 hours agorootparentI refuse to buy hardware when it comes out, and I only buy used hardware from private sellers on ebay. And only hardware that I know there&#x27;s a possibility of me (read as: my clumsy hands) repairing it without having equipment worth 10k$. The reason I am doing this is because I had several Macbooks and Ultrabooks when they were cool and shiny, and all of them died within less than 2 years. So I kinda learned my lesson.This sadly limits the options to less than let&#x27;s say 10 devices. For now I am still using my 10 years old T440p because it&#x27;s the last generation laptop that can both run coreboot and is still repairable (and it survived all the Ultrabooks I mentioned before. WTF?). But it&#x27;s too old for Vulkan because there is no Haswell support. It was the perfect laptop until around 2020 when Vulkan was rolled out. Can forget games that ran before that now, because of mesa dropping support for it.The framework will very likely be my next laptop if the current one dies, but only time will tell if the promise is worth the price.Fairphone 2&#x2F;3 are kinda useless as an ideology if there are no replacement parts available 12 months after the phone came out...so yeah, I got also two broken Fairphones I cannot repair for the moment because the bottom module isn&#x27;t available anywhere.I kinda refuse to buy a full phone just for spare parts because I can do that with literally every other cheap Chinese Android phone.With the T440p there&#x27;s no working new mint condition batteries available and only used ones that have less than 60% capacity when you buy them, so I am currently trying to design a battery case that can use 18650 cells directly without soldering. Takes a lot of time to iterate, and very hard to print with a cheap 3d printer.I think I am way too stubborn for this world, given the amount of time I spend on fixing my old hardware. reply benterix 2 hours agorootparentprev> For me that’s a great example.

If you want to stay in the game, you have to develop for the newest devices, In order to do so, you need to upgrade your Xcode. In order to do so, you have to periodically upgrade your mac. And this is more or less fine. But at the same time newer xcode drops support for older yet perfectly functioning devices.What can you do? Keep older macs with older xcode versions and at least be able to develop solutions for your own devices. But this is not a solution, it doesn&#x27;t solve anything really, and it wouldn&#x27;t help much in your kitchen example. reply miramba 2 hours agorootparent> If you want to stay in the game, you have to develop for the newest devicesEven if you don&#x27;t care, you have to upgrade to the latest Xcode to build against the latest iOS version with the cascade of consequences you described so well. reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agorootparentprevSee, even when people get rid of their old tech because they get a newer replacement or whatever, the old stuff is often not broken; with repairs like a replacement battery, or the option to use it without one, it can easily last over a decade. This is why right to repair laws and standardization are so important, to reduce the amount of discarded electronics, and to allow a \"trickle down\" kind of economics, to the point where people can get access to technology for free. reply jraph 2 hours agorootparentprevI wish I could install an up to date version of (real) Firefox on the iPad 2 I inherited and for which updates stopped in 2016. This alone would make it massively more useful. Today it mostly serves displaying music sheets, it&#x27;s fine as a PDF viewer (although there&#x27;s nothing to prevent the screen from going off too soon, which is incredibly dumb and annoying).Even better, I would very much like installing some Linux mobile distro on it.It&#x27;s limited but perfectly fine hardware with a good screen and impressive battery time. If only the software were any good.Also:- Yes, I know there&#x27;s no sim card in it.- no, I won&#x27;t log in to iBooks, this is a freaking PDF viewer for me.Every restart.Linux mobile software is flawed by accident. iOS is flawed by decision and I can&#x27;t rebuild and fix it. reply sspiff 2 hours agorootparentprevI recommend against the Nexus 7. We used it for some 10 years, mostly with Lineage OS, as a video player for our kids.We had two, and both batteries are dead. No longer charging at all.Additionally, even before the batteries went, video playback was far from great at the end.I used NewPipe for youtube videos and VLC for downloads. And while once playing, it worked fine enough, the UI interactions were frustrating because of lacking responsiveness, and the 7 inch thick bezelled form factor made it hard to watch anything without holding the device in front of you.We&#x27;ve since switched to a couple of cheap 10\" tablets and they provide a much nicer experience. reply walteweiss 45 minutes agorootparentOh, thanks for your feedback! I was worried about the N7, as the iPad is very snappy in that regard (playing video). I see almost no difference with any newer models, with the exception of super new HDR&#x2F;Spatial Audio ones. (Not needed for YouTube anyways, as even if there’s content, we don’t truly watch the iPad, but listen to it.)And it plays local H264 720p very well, usually. However, for us 480p is plenty most of the time. reply bigpeopleareold 1 hour agorootparentprevThis doesn&#x27;t happen much to me and my wife since we don&#x27;t buy much electronics without discretion. However, my wife has a specific Fossil&#x2F;Kate Spade hybrid watch (analog but can be controlled remotely) that had an app with it. One day, she was cleaning out her phone and accidentally deleted the app to control it. She tries to go back and the app is gone from the store. The watch can probably controlled with the generic software they have, but that&#x27;s not the purpose (despite the fact that watch&#x2F;app has&#x2F;had novelty features.)It&#x27;s really annoying though. The watch ticks, but it was built with features that the developer decides it can&#x27;t support anymore after a few years. I found the Android version outside the google play store and I decompiled it to find the problem she described, which is a seemingly frivolous login feature (to WeChat login service! why?!? I think all Fossil watches in the past few years do this) to control the watch. I might make it a project to fix it one day.I almost went down the path of buying a panel heater with an app - but, as a rule, no source (free to view, free to modify), no buy.Talking about iPads, we have one, an iPad mini, that is just an alarm clock now.

It&#x27;s still working perfectly fine and has even decent battery life. But the app store shows a blank page, and even if it wasn&#x27;t, all recent apps have a higher minimum iOS version (edit: because recent versions of Xcode will only build against recent iOS versions). And Apple is actively removing apps from the app store that haven&#x27;t been updated in a while. So the hardware is still fine, but there is no software available anymore and no way to sideload. reply watersb 2 hours agorootparentprevI still use my iPad 4 every day.The YouTube iOS app stopped working a while ago, I suppose the backend API changed.But YouTube still works via Safari on the iPad 4.I generally keep JavaScript turned off in Safari on that old tablet; I think it&#x27;s a RAM limitation but it could simply be that the JavaScript version is too old.

Pretty much none of that is done under the GPL.The FSF is clearly not reaching the people it needs to reach. Where&#x27;s their Youtube channel, or their Twitter? As far as I know, they have neither. I barely hear anything about the FSF on Linux sites. Their reach elsewhere has to be essentially nonexistent.And with the FSF it appears that RMS has no viable successor.

The only reason Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok and other big platforms could start up and be where they are today is because they could take a bunch of existing tools in the commons and not share back, to build their own fortune and control prison.The FSF has known this for decades, and has talked about it at large, but no, developers don&#x27;t want to listen. How do you fight greediness and individualism ? The issue runs deeper than software licenses, or even software. reply nvy 2 hours agorootparentPerhaps if the FSF had actual professionals running communications, people who persuade other people for a living, the FSF&#x27;s message would actually get through to people. reply tgma 52 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t think PR is the real issue. IMHO, the fundamental principle behind FSF philosophy is the license is primarily written to secure the long-term interest of the _user_, not the community of the authors. The reason authors were okay with that in the first place is, early on in computing, users and authors largely overlapped, if not exactly the same. Over time, the authors and users diverged widely, thus their interests diverged. FSF philosophy has failed to appeal to the authors of the software because it is economically a bad deal for them. Users who do not pay are by-and-large leeches. Also, some of the freedoms are not considered as valuable by the users as they are for fellow authors, perhaps sensibly so because they are never going to utilize such freedoms. reply dale_glass 14 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s of course an element, but there can be more than one problem at once. That the FSF holds position that&#x27;s economically tricky makes it harder to \"sell\" it, which only reinforces the need for better communication.Plus, the GPL has long been used for commercial purposes as well. reply rakoo 48 minutes agorootparentprevThe FSF has had actual professionals running communications.I don&#x27;t think the issue is in the form but in the content: developers don&#x27;t want to hear they are favoring greedy private interests (sometimes including themselves, sometimes at their expense) instead of the common goods, because the freedom to restrict a good from everyone for personal profit is more important than the freedom to access said good and build upon it. reply ekianjo 24 minutes agorootparentprevIts not about communication.

Paid for by a company whose business model is distinct from selling software (e.g. ads) and prefers to not have to worry about copyleft licensing issues in small contributions they get back from the community and be free to integrate it in proprietary products.2a. An individual author who will indirectly benefit (in both ego and monetary ways) by writing a popular piece of software. Copyleft in fact limits the spread of the software.

Anyone of didn&#x27;t know their message would understand them to be a group arguing that all software should be free of charge. This is completely orthogonal to their actual message of software having the ability to be easily understood and customized as needed by a tech-savvy user who has fairly compensated the original authors. They aimed for and missed badly the sweet spot message that all software should make simple things simple and complex things possible.This expectation that users should not have to pay for the apps&#x2F;software they use has partly lead to the dystopian landscape that is our ad-supported modern software experience.

Youtube and Twitter have power, not acknowledging that is dumb. reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agorootparentI get what you&#x27;re saying, but open soft- and hardware IS a principle, and using nonfree software themselves would come across as hypocritical, undermining their own message.The technology is there to make their own website and platforms; I&#x27;d argue that the problem isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re not active on the big social media platforms, but that they don&#x27;t produce media in the first place.They can chuck videos onto their own website, license it under a free license and allow others to repost them onto social media for exposure, for example. reply Kinrany 1 hour agorootparentThey should keep copies of all that data, yeah. Being successful in killing closed platforms shouldn&#x27;t result in any losses for them. reply l33t7332273 2 hours agorootparentprevI don’t see how to interpret your comment in a way that doesn’t say “their goal should be encouraging people to be principled, not being being principled themselves.” reply david-gpu 2 hours agorootparentYou can use a tool of a system you disagree with to raise concerns against that very system. There is no contradiction here, only pragmatism.GNU tools such as gcc were originally developed using proprietary software until the GNU fabric was dense enough to allow bootstrapping. How else can you achieve anything at all, really? reply cmrdporcupine 1 hour agorootparentprevThe GPL is a great license. It protects the author and the rights of the users. But a younger generation has gotten used to thinking of open source as \"a free thing I can use for work\", rather than as the blood-sweat-and-tears of someone else who has contributed hundreds of their own hours. So they bristle at copyleft.If I switch my project to GPL I immediately will lose most potential contributors and a lot of users, who will start complaining about my license choice or will be forbidden by their employer from contributing to it or using it.Corporate entities are (maybe rightly) scared of the GPL. And the rise of open source work by&#x2F;in FAANG companies, etc. has meant the undermining of that license. reply jokethrowaway 2 hours agorootparentprevI recently did a Free Software Day event and old timers from FSF showed up.It was great, but the ecosystem is quickly deteriorating and younger people are born in walled gardens.The EU is destroying open source in Europe thanks to CRA in the name of security.AI models mostly have crappy licenses that restrict usage. The worst culprit is HuggingFace with Stable Diffusion and OpenRail which is anything but open. It&#x27;s a \"don&#x27;t be evil license\", where evil is defined by HuggingFace but it opens the door to BS like \"you&#x27;re emitting too much CO2, you can&#x27;t use this\".I&#x27;m sure most people at Huggingface are not doing it maliciously, they probably are all 20-something socialists making half a mill a year and they don&#x27;t care about freedom.At the same time they&#x27;re also releasing a bunch of real OSS software under Apache 2.0 (often to go with OpenRail licensed models).So yeah, we&#x27;re screwed.At the same time, I think governments are removing even more freedom that what&#x27;s happening in software, so I&#x27;m kind of busy country hopping and more concerned about not becoming even more of a slave I am right now. reply adev_ 2 hours agorootparent> The EU is destroying open source in Europe thanks to CRA in the name of security.Can you develop a bit on that ?The EU is one of the rare large public institution on Mastodon currently.Also one of the rare institution to sue properly the GAFAMs successfully when they on-purpose try to fuck user around with carefully designed locked-in solution (Hello Internet Explorer, Safari and App store).Like every large political institution, it is an hydra with many yeads.

But I would rank then more in favor of OSS than against. reply jll29 1 hour agorootparentThe EU (technically, the European Commission and the European Council) is a large organization, so naturally there are many positions inside.However, my impression is it has been a force for good overall, giving us cross-country mobility, getting rid of cellphone roaming charges, and avoiding waste by trying to standardize plugs.

IMO he deserves a lot more credit than he gets for his work on gcc&#x2F;egcs. it is foundational that we have access to a compiler that can produce user created executable otherwise entire software industry would look very different. the likes of MS & Apple would have us wrapped up in licencing agreements & TOSes to stifle innovation at a basic choke-point. if anyone has any doubts you only need to look at the ecosystem for opensource h&#x2F;w design. reply epolanski 2 hours agorootparentI think he&#x27;s credited with it fine, he&#x27;s always mentioned as one of the if not the founding father of open source (albeit with less emphasis on the license debacles). reply tjpnz 2 hours agoparentprevAnd the Four Freedoms are perhaps even more relevant today. I would urge anyone to read them again now. reply bigstrat2003 1 hour agoparentprevYeah. I profoundly disagree with RMS on many things. But as much as it pains me to say it, year after year I find myself saying \"fuck, Stallman was right.\" reply mrtksn 2 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s just business though. It has nothing to do with the software, the software is just a tool to enforce a business model.A car that already has the hardware but requires payment to enable that by software is exactly the same thing as paying for a video game: The video game is already created and uploaded on the servers but software requires payment to let you download and play it. There are numerous other examples like game consoles sold at loss, printers sold less than the cost, search engines or mail services provided for free, free hosting etc. - all investing huge sums on creating the product in hope to recoup that and make profit by collecting small fees later and they need their products locked down to be able to do this.The whole thing revolves around collecting small payments for a the very large capital investment that is required to create the product in first place. Since the small payments are collected post-development, someone has to risk their large capital for this to happen, they also expect compensation and guarantees that the small payments will arrive if the product is developed successfully.The software is locked down only because they want to enforce that business model. You can refuse to participate in that but ultimately, those who can invest large amount of money end up making the much better products. reply delusional 2 hours agorootparentThis is very much not true. I&#x27;d argue that most successful and useful software has indeed NOT been made by \"those who collect the most money\". Linux is a wonderful operating system, it lets you do whatever you want, and it collect NO money. The web, created by scientists and popularized by cheap and libre software, hasn&#x27;t collected even a fraction of a promille of the value it has generated. The browser market, dominated by chrome, still has mozilla as the only currently feature complete alternative. Even the king of collecting value, Microsoft, aren&#x27;t bothering to develop their own browser.Most software worth a damn was made by a few people who cared. The business around it usually just gets in the way. This year you&#x27;ll see hundreds of startups trying to \"collect money\" for some asinine idea. Most of those startups wont create anything of value. Even the successful ones will be gone or irrelevant in 5 years. reply mrtksn 1 hour agorootparentWho paid those who created Linux? They are probably humans who have to eat 3 times a day and have a shelter. It was paid by governmental institutions, loved ones of those who write the code and ideologues who made money some other ways(like working at Microsoft or Palantir) and chipped in for the cause.Linux just has a different business model. If you can do all your things like that, cool.Many other business models are possible too, use that to create better products than the \"invest huge sums now and develop the thing, collect small payments down the road\".It&#x27;s strange to expect that other business models shouldn&#x27;t exist so yours can work.If you don&#x27;t like locked down cars, just make cars the way you see fit. reply groestl 2 hours agorootparentprev> the software is just a tool to enforce a business model.And that&#x27;s what RMS understood better than many others: His software (and by proxy it&#x27;s license) is just a tool to enforce an ethical business model. reply mrtksn 1 hour agorootparentWhat&#x27;s more ethical about receiving payments immediately for the job done at this very moment than investing your time and money to build something and receive payments for it later? reply groestl 1 hour agorootparentThat&#x27;s a strawman, because neither I nor RMS make arguments about the timing of payments in relation to work done.The restrictions on business models (imposed by software licenses as a tool) is necessary to preserve the Four Freedoms, which, at least in his view are required to use software ethically. RMS predicted, and accurately as we see, that forgoing these essential Freedoms will create a world where software is used (on us) in an unethical way. reply mrtksn 1 hour agorootparentFair enough but how are people compensated when you adhere to the ideology?You can’t advocate an ideology without a solution to the problems at hand. Someone needs to write that software, and that someone needs to be fed and sheltered. It’s also not shameful to want more than staying alive. reply layer8 7 minutes agorootparentSell support, and protection against liability.QuesnayJr 2 hours agoparentprevI remember thinking that Stallman was too pessimistic and things like that would never happen. But I was wrong, and Stallman was right. reply chpatrick 2 hours agoparentprevAnother way to look at it is Tesla sells an over the air discount in exchange for a slower car. reply onethought 2 hours agoparentprevWhy do you need? Or have the right? To modify the software. That same Tesla is cast with a proprietary alloy that not only they won’t tell you what it is, but it’s patent anyway. Same is true of the rubber in the tyres.Open source is a great thing. But it’s not better (morally) than closed source. Open is just a feature. Like Lego vs a solid plastic toy. reply loup-vaillant 2 hours agorootparentThe first principle, is when I have a thing (computer, car, toaster), I have the thing. It’s mine. I control it, I can have it repaired wherever, I can resell it, and if I have the skill, maybe even tweak it. But most importantly the thing serves me, not the corporation that sold it to me.If the thing is a general purpose computer that can run arbitrary software (and I’d be tempted to include anything that can be remotely updated as \"software\", so this would include Tesla’s firmware), then I should be able to run my software instead. That’s the true test of whether I truly own my computing device.Before we even get to Free Software, we need documented hardware architectures. reply onethought 1 hour agorootparentThat is why I made the point about the metal in a Tesla. It’s hardware, it’s yours, you have no reasonable capability to modify it, yet that is uncontroversial. So why is the software? reply mbakke 51 minutes agorootparentA metal bar will always be a metal bar.Software is malleable, and Tesla (or hackers) can change it under your feet. You should be able to inspect it and have a say in what it does or whether to accept the next update.See the recent Philips Hue debacle for an example of when software that&#x27;s been running well for years suddenly turns on the user. reply Freedom2 1 hour agorootparentprevThat doesn&#x27;t make sense. I can sell the metal, I can shape it to my will, I can rip it apart and use it for other things. Can I do that with the software? reply rakoo 2 hours agorootparentprev> But it’s not better (morally) than closed source.That&#x27;s a highly subjective opinion, and yours is not more valid than others&#x27; reply onethought 1 hour agorootparentLikewise to who I’m responding to, and exactly my point. reply minebreaker 3 hours agoprevHe is the one who we need now, in the era of saas&#x2F;cloud run by big tech.

The only real path would&#x27;ve been through legislation, and now we&#x27;re back to setting your expectations to realistic. reply missingET 2 hours agorootparentAlthough I never find myself agreeing fully with them, ideological absolutists who refuse compromise are actually useful as some kind of anchors to the Overton window. They are not the ones ending up negotiating the actual realistic solutions but their activism helps shifting the equilibrium.If your side of the argument is all compromise-makers trying to meet people halfway you often end up giving up more than you’re comfortable with. Both types of people play a useful part. reply asmor 51 minutes agorootparentThis is usually known as a radical flank, particularly useful in discussions about climate activism these days.The FSF&#x2F;GNU seems a bit too fringe and not too great at explaining the problem to everyday people instead just offering entirely uncompromising solutions that don&#x27;t work for most people. More isolationist than activist. What would the less radical organization benefiting from the existence of FSF&#x2F;GNU even be? The EFF? reply a-french-anon 2 hours agorootparentprevNot when the power balance is this big. Against big tech who has the resources to wear any conciliating opposition down, you think you&#x27;re just compromising like a \"mature adult\", until the next time, where you&#x27;re forced to compromise on your compromise and so on.Give them an inch and they&#x27;ll take (or more precisely, they took) a mile. reply missingET 1 hour agorootparentYou can’t really negotiate with corporations on what they do.On this kind of topic negotiations are at the political level and whether you like it or not they will take the unsavory position of large corporations into account. A total refusal to compromise can end up leaving your side out of the discussion and end up with worse regulation. Uncompromising idealists just don’t have the leverage to make impactful threats of leaving the negotiation table.That doesn’t mean you should not draw lines and do your best to hold them. But if the line is already crossed you can still do good negotiating, as unpleasant as it is.If there are no “soft mature adults” there to be heard, no one is heard. But your point that giving an inch ends up losing you a mile absolutely stands: this is what I was saying about absolutists being anchors, they allow the soft negotiators to start from a stricter position before the negotiation starts. A group made up entirely of “reasonable compromising people”, however, is terrible because they start from a weakened position that they view as a reasonable compromise.However, there will be negotiations and you will end up giving away some inches unless you have a lot of power. I absolutely value your un-negotiable position, but don’t underestimate what moderates can do representing it in a politically-acceptable, watered-down way. reply globular-toast 3 hours agorootparentprevI mean, he succeeded in at least giving everyone the choice.

But it was already a losing battle, because every developer wants to think they might become millionaire and won&#x27;t use it.Whether the software runs on my computer or not, if I am the user, I must be in control.Whether the meal is prepared in my kitchen or not, if I am going to eat it, I must be in control. reply loxdalen 1 hour agorootparentOT, but how are you in control if you buy food that you haven&#x27;t produced yourself? reply rakoo 47 minutes agorootparentJust like you aren&#x27;t in control of your software if you didn&#x27;t write your compiler yourself, if you didn&#x27;t build your compiler yourself, all the way down to the minerals.You&#x27;re never 100% in control, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should try and maximize it. reply 0xDEF 2 hours agorootparentprevAGPL is also the license you should use if you don&#x27;t want big corporations to use your software. Big Tech even avoids GPL-3 and stick to GPL-2 from what I have noticed. reply hardwaresofton 1 hour agorootparentNote that AGPL does not actually protect your software from big companies (or small companies) running your software as a service. It requires them to contribute back or make source available when they make changes, and IIRC thats to the user (who could be an enterprise customer under some other agreement even, but none of this is tested in court).If you want that sort of protection, BSL, SSPL, Elastic license, etc are what you want.If you want to make Free Software, make it. Know that people you don’t like may use your software, even criminals may. That is what Free Software is. OSS is slightly different but similar.If you want to make shareware, make shareware — no judgements on people who want to make money with their software and believe thats the best path. reply rakoo 52 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;m fine with big corporations use my software: the deal is that whatever they do with it, they must give it back to the users with the same license. Make it live beyond the company&#x27;s existence and control.

To my knowledge, his stated position against using non-Free software is pretty much absolute; but given that medical equipment&#x27;s software is almost universally non-Free, taking that stance here would seriously endanger his ability to receive necessary medical care. reply belorn 1 minute agoparentThis topic was discussed a while back on HN since its a topic that comes up a few times. Karen Sandler, executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy, has a pacemaker with wireless communication that runs non-free software with undisclosed source code. When it was discussed on HN a developer for such company also gave his views, including the tight regulations that covers medical devices.FSF gave Karen Sandler an reward for her work on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfconservancy.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;mar&#x2F;26&#x2F;sandler-fsf-free-...\"Richard Stallman, President of the FSF, presented Sandler with the award during a ceremony. Stallman highlighted Sandler&#x27;s dedication to software freedom. Stallman told the crowd that Sandler&#x27;s “vivid warning about backdoored nonfree software in implanted medical devices has brought the issue home to people who never wrote a line of code. Her efforts, usually not in the public eye, to provide pro bono legal advice to free software organizations and [with Software Freedom Conservancy] to organize infrastructure for free software projects and copyleft defense, have been equally helpful.”.\" reply randunel 3 hours agoparentprevI remember Stallman claiming he would use non-free software if there was no alternative, providing an example of software use without alternative at some conference. His position isn&#x27;t \"absolute\" to reject everything non-free, in his example he&#x27;d use Windows as long as there were no alternatives and usage had to be performed.Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find a link with this claim to share. reply NhanH 3 hours agoparentprevI will answer this assuming good faith, but this line of reasoning is very irritating since the answer (to me) is obvious.If RMS made a choice to use proprietary software, with the only alternative being his dead, there is absolutely no moral conflict, or even anything against his principle. The only issue could only ever arises if he claimed \"Free Software is more important than human lives\", which I am pretty sure not a claim he, or anyone, has ever made.It&#x27;s basically the same principle as if you point a gun to my head and tell me to kill a puppy or get shot (and I&#x27;m certain you would shoot me). It&#x27;s obvious which choice I would make, and I hardly see that as an evidence of my hatred for puppy. reply noirscape 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a bad question to ask; the FSF has proven in the past to be rather uninterested and unhelpful in helping developers of medical software get their stuff licensed in a way that&#x27;s either compliant or as close to as[0] being compliant as possible[1]. Instead they opted to chide those wanting help for not being true believers of the cause and told them they&#x27;ll never compromise. Basically the usual \"FSF is only ever willing to do FOSS in it&#x27;s own Ivory Tower even though its mission is to spread it beyond an Ivory Tower.\"That said - RMS has iirc said in the past that for medical emergencies he&#x27;s willing to make a personal exception on this stance.[0]: Medical devices can&#x27;t be GPL compliant due to the anti-Tivo clause combined with regulations of the FDA that demand that a medical device will always behave the exact same way in the exact same situation. This is also extended to the software, meaning that not being allowed to reflash the software if you&#x27;re not the manufacturer is a requirement.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fsf.org&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;licensing&#x2F;gplv3-fda reply debugnik 46 minutes agorootparentThis is wrong, the GPLv3 only requires installation information for \"User Products\" (as defined in the license) which the manufacturer can update even if the user can&#x27;t. Most medical equipment isn&#x27;t User Products and can&#x27;t simply be updated by the manufacturer for regulatory reasons.That article was written before the finished GPLv3 was published, they had only published a stricter draft. reply hutzlibu 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Medical devices can&#x27;t be GPL compliant due to the anti-Tivo clause combined with regulations of the FDA that demand that a medical device will always behave the exact same way in the exact same situation.\"What is the anti-tivo clause? reply noirscape 1 hour agorootparentOk so that requires a bit of history. There&#x27;s this company that makes video recorders (for your TV) called TiVo; it&#x27;s not an abbreviation for anything, that&#x27;s just the name.--Anyway, TiVo wanted to get onto the GPLv2 train like a lot of companies, but they also wanted people owning their devices to be unable to partially modify their firmware even as they distributed their copies of the firmware onto TiVo boxes. They enforced this by having a digital signature check that only allowed TiVos own software to run if the software stack was entirely TiVo. It would also work if the stack was entirely FOSS because only TiVo checked it.For the sake of clarity; Bradley Kuhn of the SFC iirc investigated the TiVo boxes at the time, the signature checks only were an issue if you partially replaced TiVos software, not if you went the whole hog on replacing it; excercising GPLv2 rights was completely possible and you could turn a TiVo box into a XBMC (these days that&#x27;s Kodi) box. You just couldn&#x27;t run TiVos software ever again if you did that thanks to a hardware check.The FSF took personal offense to this practice and dubbed it \"Tivoization\", which is a shorthand for \"at",

I&#x27;d even argue that routing is the easy part of PCB design. Figuring out the circuit is hardest, specifying design rules is confusing, determining the component placement is tough, and on the easy end, drawing the schematic and routing the PCB are roughly on par. Routing is the part at the end where you can relax and enjoy yourself while you untangle the ratsnest. reply franga2000 8 hours agorootparentprevAs a beginner, I find autorouting entirely unnecessary for the level of complexity I work with. Routing is pretty much the simplest part of the process to understand and somewhere between a fun puzzle and a tedious but simple chore depending on the specific design. I&#x27;m pretty sure there used to be a very popular mobile game that, while visually completely different, had the exact kind of \"mechanics\" as manually placing traces on a PCB does.What would be helpful, however, are some better checking tools. Some mistakes, like running a trace right through the bottom side of a through-hole and creating a short that wasn&#x27;t there on the schematic, seem very easy to detect and warn the user about before they end up spending hours cutting traces and running bodge wires. reply tetha 31 minutes agorootparent\"Can&#x27;t live without Electricity\" rings a bell there for me. reply RF_Savage 4 hours agorootparentprevSome of the softwares have live DRC, so it will either prvent you from doing it or mark the nets as violating design rules.I have not checked if kicad or Librepcb have it, but PADS and Altium do. reply wkipling 4 hours agorootparentKiCad wont let you do this as part of the design rules.

This is what I use the autorouter for. I put together a placement that has logical clustering and flow to it and try running the autorouter. If it has a really hard time with lots of vias, I focus on tuning the placement in that area until it can get a relatively ok autoroute. Then I tear up the traces and manually route.

Virtually everyone who starts doing PCBs goes through a phase where they think that it must be “easy” to press a button and get everything laid out and connected. Countless developers have tried to create software to do that over the years.Maybe some day it will come to fruition, but the reality is that autorouting just isn’t very useful for setting up entire boards.I think beginners get confused because they think the schematic connections contain all of the information needed to properly route a real board. Then you get into the real world and realize that you need to select connector locations in a way that make sense, place capacitors to minimize loop area, orient components to keep parasitics minimized on important nodes, make traces bigger where you need high current or better heat dissipation, and so on.Which is why it’s not condescending to say that autorouting&#x2F;autoplacement isn’t useful. It’s just a reality of making PCBs. You have to do a lot of manual decision making at layout time that isn’t easily automated away.I have used autorouters for certain buses, but I have to set up the constraints in detail and steer the routing myself still. There is no autorouting&#x2F;autoplacement that will make good boards for you, even though everyone goes through a phase where they assume it must exist. reply Alupis 12 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fair position to take. PCB design is complex - there are very few complex tasks that can be whittled down to a single click of a button with good results.Take software for example - newbies can and do write code, but it&#x27;s rarely good or error-free. Codeless solutions have appeared - but there&#x27;s good reasons even those aren&#x27;t used often.Any auto-routing feature is going to appeal to absolute beginners, and few if anyone else. So, we&#x27;re asking a FOSS project to spend a tremendous amount of time building in a good-enough auto-routing feature that only a small portion of their audience will ever actually use, or use more than once.If your board is simple enough for auto-routing to provide value to you - then I would assert your board is simple enough for you to spend 30 minutes doing the layout yourself. reply ajford 11 hours agorootparentGotta say your comment is either from the point of view of a subject matter expert who&#x27;s forgotten what it&#x27;s like for newbies or hobbyists, or someone who&#x27;s just condescending. PCB design is complex, but the kind of boards a newbie or hobbyist is likely to design using a fresh tool like this wouldn&#x27;t be. Hell, most signals under a few MHz are quite tolerant of shitty routing and would be just fine.I worked with an RF engineer who&#x27;d been in the field since the 70s, and he&#x27;d always use the auto-router for anything \"slow\". If it was \"digital dc\" or digital logic or under a MHz then it was auto-routed because he didn&#x27;t have time for that. Anything critical that carried RF or drove a reference was hand-routed first then anything left would get the auto-routing treatment. And this was in a radio astronomy observatory! reply Alupis 11 hours agorootparentI disagree. Learning the tools and skills to do a task is the default assumption for anything - be it riding a bike or building a SaaS.If you cannot commit a few minutes to learn how to route correctly, then you really are just \"hoping\" for something magical to work.Would you take the same position in software? Almost certainly not - because it is complex.Sure, there&#x27;s plenty of no-code or low-code platforms out there - but why are they not more popular? Because they universally suck and their target user quickly \"graduates\" into real coding.People asking&#x2F;demanding auto-routers are asking a FOSS project to commit a lot of time and resources (because it&#x27;s not trivial to implement!) to a feature a very small subset of their userbase will ever use, and will also be the most negatively impacted by said tool when it fails them without them realizing.Seriously, if your board layout can be done by an auto-router then it is a trivial board and you should spend a few minutes learning the basics. There is nothing but upside in doing so. reply pzo 11 hours agorootparent> Would you take the same position in software? Almost certainly not - because it is complex.Why not?> Sure, there&#x27;s plenty of no-code or low-code platforms out there - but why are they not more popular?I would compare software with auto routing and without more to Python with C situation. Auto routing is more like garbage collector to me. Should we discourage people from programming in Python just because for hobbyist C or C++ might too hardcore? It&#x27;s not that they have to be professional developers - why not let them learn how to write even simple python script that help them processing some text and do simple automation? It&#x27;s not that everyone need or want to write operating system.After all today python is the most popular programming language even though it mostly started being used in education or basic scripting.

Maybe one day they will be, but we&#x27;re very far away from that. No two component manufacturers do anything the same... reply carbotaniuman 11 hours agorootparentRight, but ChatGPT cannot debug your software for you either, not without a lot of work. Traditional autorouting is connecting pins - similar to how ChatGPT glues together software components. reply dragontamer 10 hours agorootparentIts not the connection of pins that makes PCBs so hard.Its the random creation of antenna that suddenly throws your electrons off the board and suddenly causing nearby traces (to also turn into antenna) to get crosstalk leading to failure. Or throwing your electrons off the board and failing EMI regulations.With 1ns rise&#x2F;fall times on typical microcontrollers (even a 4MHz ATMega328 &#x2F; Arduino), an antenna can be inadvertently created with just a 75mm trace. With a faster chip, you could have antenna at 25mm or even shorter traces.-----------PCB board design today is about understanding the physical attributes of the PCB: how the stackup causes your board to act like a capacitor (and therefore a source of voltage when the bulk &#x2F; decoupling capacitors run out of energy). Seriously, this is called \"PDN\" or power-distribution network. You turn Layer2 into a ground-plane and add a plane to Layer3, calculate the dielectric thickness and estimate the amount of latent capacitance you get between a 30mm^2 ground vs power plane seperated by 0.1mm of dielectric.And not only do you calculate this, you *take advantage of it* to reduce high-frequency (ie: 1GHz+) power-delivery issues.Which could happen as low as ~100MHz in practice, because its more about rise&#x2F;fall times than it is about the actual clock speeds.--------There are two kinds of PCB designers. Those who know that they&#x27;re designing an antenna... and those who do not know they&#x27;re designing an antenna. The PCB itself is an antenna and you need to design it in a very peculiar manner to minimize radiation. You can&#x27;t just guess-and-check this (I mean, I guess with enough time&#x2F;money you can guess&#x2F;check... but ideally you lay things out with a mental simulation of inductances, eddy currents, an idea of electric fields and return paths of your signals across low-through-high frequencies) reply Alupis 11 hours agorootparentprevI agree, except auto-routing as a feature often isn&#x27;t just connecting pins, but placing components too.

They are wrong.* The very best most costly, fall over and fail* If your design is simple enough for the autorouter to work at all, then it&#x27;s simple enough to do yourself.These two points are true and unavoidable.The \"subject matter expert\", actually, all of them not just any paryicular one, is in fact a subject matter expert, and is giving you the useful information that you lack.

(a) requires subject matter expertise that beginners won&#x27;t have and (b) really is such simple point and click that beginners don&#x27;t gain anything from an autorouter. The beginner already has to learn enough to place components on the board before routing, which IMO is where 80% of the leverage of expertise comes in anyway.The calculation changes if you&#x27;re all bought in on an EDA package like Altium and you know all about modular schematics and PCB docs on with standardized PCB layering. Then maybe you can start cobbling together quick designs that are largely autorouted but again, catch 22: you have to know enough Altium to know how to do that and enough electronics to know how to select open source modules and parts. reply neltnerb 10 hours agorootparentI spent long enough getting tired of routing low impact traces that I actually learned to use the autorouter.And I mean *learned* because it was not as simple as clicking a button.Using it right means dropping down keepouts over sensitive areas so that the autorouter knows to stay away -- you know it, but it has no way to. It means placing vias to a ground plane next to every ground pin so that it doesn&#x27;t try to deal with top layer ground planes breaking. It means telling it how much to penalize a trace for being routed on the power plane layer or the ground plane layer. [and on]It&#x27;s a super useful tool -- if you are careful with it like you should be with, well, chatgpt. Give it all the information you know it needs to know, patiently and quantitatively, and sure it&#x27;ll find a reasonably optimal solution. You just have to tune it as well as you tuned yourself.[edit: and you can do it in the reverse order for nasty piles of spaghetti nets that you can&#x27;t smooth out with part placement, to get hints on where you&#x27;ll have to run busses later so that you leave room -- but always route the sensitive traces first] reply deepspace 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s been 30 years since I was working closely with PCB designers, but back in the day, the professional CAD folks would absolutely run the autorouter first, and then use that as a starting point to tweak the layout.I would have thought that autorouting would have improved in all that time, but from this conversation, it sounds like it has become worse. What gives? reply syntheticgate 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d suggest design complexity has scaled at a faster rate than the autorouting tech. In a closer-to-DC world years ago, optimal routing was nice but often not a requirement. In today&#x27;s high-speed designs, proper routing can be the difference between working and not working, and there is a constant battle of constraints and trade-offs that humans can deal with more effectively. Attempting to constrain a complex design such that an auto-router can be successful can often result in an over-constrained problem which then makes the auto-router unsuccessful.More focus on hybrid routing tools where there is some automation going on while a user routes things is typically were you get much more useful help in modern ECAD. reply dvdkon 12 hours agorootparentprevBack then, many boards used to be routed with vertical traces on one layer and horizontal traces on another, \"Manhattan routing\". Somehow, the circuits worked. Nowadays you can&#x27;t be so \"careless\" to hit EMI targets or even to get a working board. Switching PSUs, data buses, clock signals, all those have spacing, impedance control, ground coupling and other requirements.Maybe you could encode all of them in the schematic and then let a modern algorithm suggest a board layout, but in practice nobody seems to do it that way (note that I am just a hobbyist with limited experience). reply RF_Savage 4 hours agorootparentAnd the eighties computers with low cost two layer boards and complex designs like that on them are one of the reasons why all products have to pass FCC Part 15 radiated emissions EMC tests, not just the intentional radiators. The old computers were rather bad on that front. reply eternityforest 8 hours agorootparentprevRouting isn&#x27;t the hard part though. The hard part, by far, is finding and checking footprints, and physically assembling the board.I hope they add autorouting, but I would much rather have more parts libraries, access to the part supply house APIs, more 3D models, better tools for verifying that your design will be pick and placed the way you think it will and there isn&#x27;t something inexplicably upside down because of a bad footprint file, etc.Hobbyists often like to do more analog stuff with discrete parts than I do, so SPICE simulation in a way that&#x27;s as easy as the Falstad sim may be important.I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any true beginner friendly open sims out there, ideally you&#x27;d have a one-click way to fuzz all the components and see how everything behaves with noise in every wire, bad connections everywhere, 60Hz buzz getting in, etc, so you could verify it still works in the worst case of crappy counterfeit parts and loose connections. reply ShadowBanThis01 12 hours agorootparentprevNobody&#x27;s asking it to design a complete, multi-layer PCB. I&#x27;m a pretty-near total noob and I would think that a 2-D auto-router that would at least optimize the orientation of components for the fewest trace conflicts might be possible and useful.Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;d be possible to create such a thing, which would also create labeled solder points for jumpers where traces needed to cross?Maybe \"rat&#x27;s nest\" already does this; I don&#x27;t know what that is. reply dbrgn 11 hours agorootparentRatsnest means that you have thin lines indicating which pads need to be connected. You can see them here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;librepcb.org&#x2F;features&#x2F;board-editor&#x2F;board-branching.g...You start out the board deisgn by orienting your parts in a way that there are as few intersections as possible. Then you draw the connections, and the ratsnest lines disappear one by one. If you have intersections, you need to route around the part, or work with multiple PCB layers to get rid of them. reply ShadowBanThis01 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the info. reply civilitty 10 hours agorootparentprevMore representative sample of a ratsnest showing just a fraction of a board: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.vidyard.com&#x2F;thumbnails&#x2F;TdqAcWKgxGMwyKOQEtyTBg&#x2F;26...At that point \"as few intersections as possible\" becomes a bit of a lark and to maintain any semblence of sanity you have to prioritize connections, hiding all other nets. reply Alupis 12 hours agorootparentprevThe main issue is the auto-router has no idea what any of the components are or what their requirements are. It just knows roughly physical dimensions and it&#x27;s connected nets (traces between pins). These component requirements aren&#x27;t something that can easily be \"programmed\" into the tool either - every component has it&#x27;s own requirements, and they&#x27;re not just electrical (such as needing certain amount of space around a component, or not placing next to other types of components, etc).Without that knowledge, it&#x27;s impossible to create a good auto-router&#x2F;layout tool. The tools often just stack components as close together as physically allowed by the necessary traces.For very trivial stuff, it might work ok. Anything else, no chance unfortunately. reply ShadowBanThis01 4 hours agorootparentYeah, that&#x27;s too bad.

Eagle&#x27;s auto-router was easier to use, but it was also attached to Eagle.At the end of the day, the difference between getting an autorouter to the point that it can autoroute a simple 2-layer board with lots of through hole parts, getting it to the point that its useful to the average professional, is monstrous. There&#x27;s so much more to routing that just widths and clearances. It will probably someday be the case that most PCBs are laid out and routed entirely by computers. But for now, there&#x27;s too much subtlety in PCB design. I&#x27;d lose my mind if I had AI-designed boards failing QC because of tombstoning, for instance. I&#x27;m not sure that anyone is trying to simulate board heating in detail enough to predict its occurrence, let alone evaluate solutions prior to board fab. And yet, the solution is pretty easy once you see that its happening in the first place. reply stvltvs 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s been a long while since I&#x27;ve designed PCB, but doesn&#x27;t auto-routing provide a good starting point that the designer can refine? I remember it reducing a lot of grunt work. reply dragontamer 13 hours agorootparentRats nest is good enough IMO. Just saying \"Pin#20 needs to be connected to Pin#88\", with a visual indication that they&#x27;re not connected yet, is plenty. A Rat&#x27;s nest is more than enough to figure out which parts need to be placed next to each other, at least for beginner boards with like ~50 or fewer components on them (and maybe ~100 or less nets&#x2F;traces to manage)The issue with PCB-design is that:1. Even the slowest ~4MHz microcontrollers have 1ns rise&#x2F;fall times, or 1GHz+ of high-frequency noise all over the place. Faster chips have even faster rise&#x2F;fall times.2. ~1GHz wavelength is ~30cm, meaning that a 7.5cm trace is an effective antenna for 1GHz noise. As it turns out, 7.5cm is well within the scope of typical PCB design. A faster rise&#x2F;fall time (ex: 0.2ns rise&#x2F;fall time is 5GHz noise instead) could have \"antennas\" as small as 2.5cm or 25mm.3. Vias have non-negligible inductance and resistance. Modern signal design also requires the designer to think of \"the return path\", so a 2nd nearby via to serve as a capacitively-coupled via (IE: \"Route a ground-via next to any signal-via\"), and other such rules, are rarely followed by autorouters.------------It looks like the professional tools are fixing this problem by performing FEA of signals &#x2F; coupling &#x2F; electronic flux, and helping the engineer visualize the magnetic and electrical fields of the designed PCB-layout.However, if you are a conservative human, you can get such a feel for your circuit by thinking about return-paths and mentally thinking about microstrips (ex: wire + ground-plane return), or striplines (ex: ground-wire-ground plane for internal layers). The return path is always on the nearby ground plane, so it makes it very easy to think about. reply Alupis 13 hours agorootparentprevIt creates more problems than it solves for anything but very trivial layouts.It has no comprehension of the actual components it&#x27;s placing, or the nets it&#x27;s routing. So it&#x27;ll find a physical layout that matches your schematic in a logical sense, but the actual circuit may not work when it&#x27;s finally assembled (ADC placed next to a switching power supply, for example). Some components have strict tolerances or needs, and some types of designs require special considerations.So, a newbie will click the button to auto-route and then have the board fabricated and then do the final assembly - then wonder why it doesn&#x27;t work, or it sometimes works, etc. If you don&#x27;t have the skills and knowledge to do the layout the \"right\" way, you likely don&#x27;t have the skills or knowledge to debug a bad board layout.PCB layout is not trivial. Some folks spend an entire career doing just PCB layout. For low-speed trivial designs, you can get away with a lot of bad practices, but it&#x27;s best to invest some small amount of time learning the craft.However, general rule of thumb, if your design works on a breadboard then you can probably make it work on a PCB... probably. reply aswanson 13 hours agorootparentAdc near a switching power supply made me lol. Some guy at a previous gig did that with 190v pwm motor drives. No autotouter in the loop. Just a bad human. reply CamperBob2 13 hours agorootparentprevPlacement is usually as important as routing, if not more so. At the same time, the act of thinking carefully about placement will often making routing easier. I try to take a holistic view -- I don&#x27;t see routing as grunt work, or as an unnecessary chore, but as part of the design process.On a long-enough timeline, ML tools will become a natural fit for placement and routing. It is a rather dumb thing for humans to have to deal with, at the end of the day, but the existing tools are just not good enough to take over the job. At least not the tools that most of us have access to. reply dragontamer 12 hours agorootparentUnless ML tools know which nets have how much current&#x2F;voltages on them, as well as which ones are sensitive to noise... as well as rise&#x2F;fall times of each pin, its a hopeless job.Lets say you have a trace that&#x27;s 4mm wide that skips across a slot in the ground-plane. Is this good or bad?1. Why is it 4mm? Is this a high-current line &#x2F; power line of some kind? A crude power-plane that&#x27;s just oversized for a trace? Is this a switching regulator with a bit of switching noise? Or is it a \"quiet\" power line, like a battery or LDO-line?2. Is this trace actually ground? And the 4mm is to \"jump\" across the gnd-slot to provide a controlled return-path for some other line? What is the relationship of this trace vs another trace?----------If its a fat line on a switching power supply with a ton of current, maybe its a bad idea. If its a fat gnd, maybe its a good idea. Its all contextual. Its not very clear how a hypothetical ML tool would figure out this context, outside of like learning to read data-sheets and&#x2F;or the EE writing down the purpose (very precisely) on each net... which probably is slower than just routing the trace manually to begin with. reply CamperBob2 11 hours agorootparentThe tool will have access to the same data sheets and SPICE&#x2F;IBIS models that you do. It will know what to do.Eventually. reply dragontamer 11 hours agorootparentAre you going to put the source-code of your programs in there too? I&#x27;m not sure how a ML model would ever know that... say... Pin A5 is a rarely-changing GPIO that&#x27;s effectively DC. Or that Pin-B6 is configured as an analog-DAC in this particular application (and therefore slowly changing).Or hell, that PinC1 is an input vs output.Modern chips have very flexible pins. Many microprocessors (and MCUs) can configure any pin to be input, output, tri-state output, pull-up output, or pull-down output, for example, with different properties in each state. Some pins can be analog (on-board op-amps), others can be digital and high frequency, still others can be digital but rarely-changing &#x2F; effectively DC for the lifetime of the application.Each scenario changes how you&#x27;d route a trace. replyfnordpiglet 13 hours agorootparentprevNewbies probably value it as it’s a feature newbies use.

None of which have enough info for import into another EDA program. This thing is very self-contained, which is unusual for an open source program.The limitation here is that only KiCad has an open format for design files to begin with. Maybe we should be agitating for a better open-standard for schematic capture? I&#x27;d love to be able to output a schematic from e.g. a spice simulation, then import that into my ECAD suite. The netlist (which is part of the Gerber output) is human-readable, so I suppose its possible to extract the schematic from that.

For example Altium Designer recently added a functional kicad importer.But the DXF stuff? Excellent for integration with mechanical CAD tools and for use with RF simulators like CST or HFSS. QUCS Studio is the odd one out that they support importing kicad layout files into their EM simulator. reply Findecanor 12 hours agoparentprev> DXF is for mechanical CAD. You can&#x27;t import a board layout or schematic that way.There have been times I have wished that I could import DXF as footprints in Kicad because it was easier to draw complex shapes in QCad or Inkscape. I think it could also be useful to import object placement&#x2F;orientation data from a DXF file and snap to those when placing components.For the latter use-case, I have instead written placements by hand as code in a Python script and made that output both DXF and Kicad files. reply SV_BubbleTime 11 hours agorootparentYou kind of can in KiCAD. You import to a footprint, and change the lines to the type you want (courtyard, silkscreen, front copper, etc), and for things like pads you can use DXF for reference and centerpoints then put your pads in.The CAD tools inside KiCAD could be a lot better (esp since it’s using FreeCAD under the hood and the tools should be there) but it’s OKAY as is. reply junon 12 hours agoparentprevDXF was integral in importing things from freecad for outlines, designs, and in some cases even silkscreens.Also, beginners shouldn&#x27;t even autoroute.

Chief amongst them is that there&#x27;s no guarantee that a given footprint will work in the context of the overall assembly. Will you get tomb-stoning? Will the combination of fab capabilities and assembly capabilities necessitate a larger aperture for a given pad?

The second largest chunk of time is spent doing the engineering schematic design and analysis. After that is PCB placement. After that is building schematic and PCB symbols. After that is actual routing.Yes, building library symbols annoys me. It&#x27;s tedious and error prone. However, it&#x27;s integral to your design and you can&#x27;t skimp. The sooner you accept that, that better off you will be.(A good example is your vias underneath a QFN for power and heat transfer. If your via rules change because you have a different board house, some of your physical symbols may need to change slightly. This sucks, and no library manager is ever going to solve this.) reply Gracana 8 hours agorootparentYep. A good portion of my time helping folks with PCB design is in getting them comfortable with making their own symbols and footprints.Draw the parts. It&#x27;s not that hard. Don&#x27;t worry about libraries. Yes, somebody may have done it already. No, that one isn&#x27;t the same. Just draw it, you have the datasheet. Make the symbol that fits your schematic, it&#x27;ll be way better than shoehorning in the one you found.I get it, I&#x27;m annoyed every time I have to draw a symbol, but that&#x27;s just how it is. Every project I work on, I make a new library and draw symbols to put in it. I copy most library symbols I use into it so I can modify them. I reuse my own symbols, but I modify them for the new project. It&#x27;s a fact of life... embrace it. reply nickelpro 4 hours agorootparentWatI download 99.9% of the symbols I don&#x27;t already have available locally from online libraries. Why would I draw a symbol for random part when the manufacturer provides one and has uploaded it to all the usual places. reply RF_Savage 4 hours agorootparentBecause almost all manufacturers outsource the footprint creation stuff.

Switching regulators are sensitive to PCB layout, component selection, and parasitics of the PCB itself. You can’t really treat switching regulator schematics as cut-and-paste building blocks like this because the layout requires an understanding of how the circuit works, where the switching nodes are, and how to organize everything to keep parasitics low.If you take a random 48V switching regulator schematic and lay it out without understanding these details, you’re likely to blow the switch up from ringing or at least have terrible EMI radiation.The basic building blocks for beginners would be more like low-speed logic circuits and simple microcontrollers circuits. Jumping into medium voltage switching regulators and battery charging (which can result in fires very easily if you’re not careful) is far from simple. reply Gracana 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s definitely not simple, but I think it&#x27;s approachable, even for a beginner, but you&#x27;ve got to put in the work.

Bandcamp is still profitable, but that makes it just a particuarly saleable non-core business. Also dumped was SuperAwesome, a “youth marketing solutions” company, in an upper management buyout. Bandcamp unionised in March 2023. Game development companies are allergic to unions, so that probably made Bandcamp a fair bit less attractive. Epic even tried to get record labels to pressure the Bandcamp United union to stop their efforts. Epic lost most of an expensive lawsuit against Apple in 2021, and both sides are appealing to the US Supreme Court at further expense. Epic only bought Bandcamp eighteen months ago. Nobody could work out quite what Epic could do with Bandcamp. That seems to include Epic. It didn’t have synergy with game development or distribution. Bandcamp is good, it’s profitable and sustainable and it basically works. Musicians love Bandcamp and depend on it. They worried at the Epic sale and now they wonder what the Songtradr sale means. Plus point: at least Songtradr is in the same business. Minus point: at least Epic wasn’t in the same business, and didn’t mess with Bandcamp, despite many musicians’ fears when they bought it. Songtradr is talking up using its licensing prowess to give opportunities to Bandcamp artists — including licensing on Epic games. Songtradr can’t just grab your Bandcamp uploads. Sync licensing (TV or movies) is very lucrative and hence legally complex. You need to licence both the composition and the desired recording of it. The licenses can be disconcertingly short. Games are one of the places composers can get work these days. Game music and classical are the same genre, right? If Songtradr can hook up composers with Epic or other companies, there are plenty of composers who will be extremely interested. Thinking of the loved one, with her six albums of light classical.

What does this mean for the musicians?” David Gerard says: 28 September, 2023 at 9:58 pm Rumour from Hacker News: > Throwaway, but I work at Bandcamp. We’re all very frightened and don’t know what the future holds. We were told that some, but not all, will get offers from Songtradr and it may be up to a month before we receive an offer. It’s pretty depressing. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37695035 Federico says: 29 September, 2023 at 5:42 am Interesting. It sounds like SongTradr is positioning itself as a vertically integrated competitor to the other streaming businesses, one which could be able to replace labels, publishers, collecting societies, content recognition and subscription services. Will it team up with Soundreef too? The big question is whether they’re plan is to fight the copyright cartels or to join them. Not being under Epic sounds like an improvement, but not if the result is being purchased by Universal/whatever down the line. David Gerard says: 29 September, 2023 at 7:46 am that’s the end point for a successful indie distributor. I shouldn’t have been surprised to find out PIAS was 49% owned by Universal. David Gerard says: 29 September, 2023 at 7:57 am Tom Ellard of Severed Heads, who sells his records on Bandcamp, is quite interested by the deal: > Ok doing the diligence on Songtradr. They do music licensing e.g. TikTok, YouTube also traditional TVC. You pay them a fee every month to offer your tracks for synch. > They want BandCamp because a proportion of BC artists might pay this fee. If you have ambition to sell soundtracks this doesn’t hurt* > Epic Marketplace will become just one of the venues. They prob won’t fuss BC because they need lots of music. > *most of my income is from synch. If you want $ it’s important. #bandcamp https://mastodon.sdf.org/@lardmotel/111145640060611780 Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

(rocknerd.co.uk) 305 points by davidgerard 14 hours ago| hidepastfavorite177 comments Modified3019 12 hours agoMake sure to archive your bandcamp collection, which you can do with the following script: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;easlice&#x2F;bandcamp-downloader Other downloaders only target the openly available mp3 files.I have a straightforward guide on how to get up and running on windows here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;easlice&#x2F;bandcamp-downloader&#x2F;issues&#x2F;21You should always archive your collection anyways. One negative thing about bandcamp is that artists&#x2F;labels&#x2F;bandcamp can remove anything at anytime for any reason, so things you paid for can straight up disappear. This was very disappointing to discover. Note that sometimes things are set as hidden, rather than outright removed. This info may be outdated, as the relevant support page seems to gave changed from the last time I looked at it.Because of their no DRM policy and full on downloads, not just streaming, Bandcamp has basically become the only place I’ll buy music outside of CDs.I’m happy enough to hand artists money if it’s easy and I can archive a lossless copy, but if they start fucking around with things, I’ll go right back to doing what I was before. That said, if they fix the outright removal of paid things problem, and start treating “artist” as first class instead of “label” in searches and links, I’ll be singing their praises. reply meeby 5 hours agoparentOf a similar nature, my weekend project last week:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meeb&#x2F;bandcampsyncDoes much the same thing, but it unpacks the zips and tracks the directories. It can run as a docker container which syncs your collection on a daily timer. The use case is to download your purchases to local directories for use with Jellyfin&#x2F;Plex&#x2F;etc. You can just buy music and it&#x27;ll appear on your local media server automatically within a day. reply jefozabuss 2 hours agorootparentdidn&#x27;t want to create an issue on github for this but just looked at it and seems to have a duplicated PUID setting (the 2nd should be PGID I guess) in entrypoint.sh reply meeby 2 hours agorootparentThanks! Fixed in v0.3.3. Feel free to open an issue for stuff like that. reply Wowfunhappy 12 hours agoparentprev> Because of their no DRM policy and full on downloads, not just streaming, Bandcamp has basically become the only place I’ll buy music outside of CDs.Just so you know, Apple and Amazon also offer DRM free music downloads. Obviously, you have to actually buy the individual song or album, not a streaming plan.In Apple&#x27;s case you do need to install iTunes to get your DRM-free file (on Windows, I&#x27;m not sure what the status is on Mac nowadays), which kind of sucks. reply eindiran 11 hours agorootparentI have also purchased music on Amazon and let&#x27;s not pretend its \"full on downloads\", Amazon has V0 MP3 only iirc and Bandcamp offers ever format under the sun including FLAC and ALAC.Don&#x27;t know about Apple because iTunes doesn&#x27;t have Linux support and the whole setup of downloading an app in order to download a file strikes me as a bit gross. reply Wowfunhappy 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s true Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer lossless audio downloads, but they&#x27;re very good quality, and DRM-Free.iTunes downloads are AAC, 250+ kb&#x2F;s (remember this bitrate is with a more efficient codec).I&#x27;m probably opening a can of worms here, but I&#x27;m really quite skeptical more than one in a million people could tell the difference between iTunes and lossless in a blind test. Maybe drop that to one in a thousand for Amazon vs Lossless. (I really do wish Amazon offered AAC downloads.) reply Modified3019 9 hours agorootparentFor me it’s not about somehow hearing a difference (at least, not anymore, especially at my age. Thought I do remember the days when mp3s had a good chance of sounding tinny from bad encoding, even when done by myself from a CD). Honestly, I probably have a nonzero amount of bandcamp flac files that are actually just mp3’s that were converted, but I’m unlikely to ever know unless I analyze the waveform.For me it’s about having a reference&#x2F;master copy to archive and then modify, cutting parts away I don’t like, applying equalization, etc and compressing for streaming&#x2F;loading on a device. I am not going to compound losses on a file if I can help it.Storage space is trivial these days, so just grabbing a flac file and declaring that it’s perfectly as the artist intended removes any potential cognitive load of trying to evaluate audio quality or “which of these mp3 files is the best one to archive” anxiety.Basically: Start clean, stay clean, and move on. reply deadbunny 11 minutes agorootparentThis is what I do as well. I prefer to have the FLAC files for local playback and archiving then have a script which watches the FLAC folder, converts to v0 MP3 which then gets synced to my phone using Syncthing (because phones have such limited storage these days without Micro SD). reply foresto 10 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m really quite skeptical more than one in a million people could tell the differenceConsider that lossless is good not only for listening, but also for transcoding. For example, when you want to use a media player with limited formats, or when the inevitable future codecs become popular.(And for archival of digital source material, lossless is the only sensible option.) reply JohnFen 11 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s true Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer lossless audio downloads, but they&#x27;re very good quality, and DRM-FreeThey are DRM-free, but I wouldn&#x27;t characterize the MP3s as \"very good quality\". They&#x27;re only OK. It was the quality of their encodings that got me to stop buying music downloads from Amazon. reply pdntspa 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m a DJ on mid-range monitoring hardware and I can definitely hear the difference with apple&#x27;s encodes vs FLAC, at least on their older encodes. I am not 100% sure its the compression protocol (could be differences in mastering since streaming has different requirements) but the attentuation on bass and watery-sounding cymbals stick out like a sore thumb in the right listening environmentI only buy music on itunes as a last resort, so I don&#x27;t have a huge sample size. reply musicale 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a shame (and puzzling really) that Apple only offers lossless on the streaming side and not on the purchase side. I don&#x27;t need a physical CD, just the bits on it. reply ubermonkey 11 hours agorootparentprevI really wonder if you can do this in a double blind, ABX test. reply xoac 10 hours agorootparentNote that parent is a DJ and while DJing the files are bot just reproduced but usually there is some digital processing involved. This makes it easier to hear the difference. reply pdntspa 4 hours agorootparentMaybe but I don&#x27;t do critical listening on club systems unless I&#x27;m checking my own mixdowns. Unless the DJ is redlining (which they shouldn&#x27;t be if they&#x27;re competent) the audio should come out of the mixer relatively unmolested. My critical listening rig is a broadcast amp with two passive studio monitors.Should also note I can&#x27;t hear the different between well-encoded 320kbit and FLAC. But lower bitrates (256kbit and lower) on mp3 are audible. reply throwaway290 4 hours agorootparentI showed a friend once how bitrate and sampling frequency start to really matter when doing stuff like slowing down a lot. But I guess it&#x27;s not typical in DJing. reply Washuu 20 minutes agorootparentI generally record everything in 44khz, but I will record at 192khz if I know I will be doing any time stretching. The high sampling frequency matters for that. Foobar8568 5 hours agorootparentprevI can spot and recognize the audio on ABX if I focus with basically a 100% rate on the infamous ABX test website with a HD600 headphone, so basically a crap one. Now if you ask me which one would be the best sounding or lossless (for the \"highest\" quality one, obviously for other it&#x27;s relatively easy to spot in a clean environment), I believe I would have a harder time. reply hatsix 9 hours agorootparentprevthen you should check out SongTradr&#x27;s other recent acquisition, 7digital.com... not only do they have flac, but many have 16 and 24bit available. reply vintermann 2 minutes agorootparentAfaik 7digital is the main backing service of a lot of streaming sites like qobuz and Deezer.7digital is chock full of spam. Spotify, for all their faults, has some people who care about quality on those sort of things (the old Echo Nest people). 7digital and their white-label frontends don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re skeleton crew operations.I hope they understand, they can&#x27;t run Bandcamp like that. Bandcamp has had problems like this in the past, with people spamming the services with other people&#x27;s music and pretending to be them. It happened to an old classmate of mine who&#x27;s a reasonably well known Jazz musician. Someone pretended to be her on Bandcamp for years.If this roll-up company plans to run Bandcamp like 7digital, there will be a ton more of stuff like that. weinzierl 1 hour agorootparentprev7digital also removes content occasionally, so be sure to download and archive what you&#x27;ve bought. reply pdntspa 4 hours agorootparentprevThey have the same problem as nearly every other digital music store that isn&#x27;t beatport.... and that is that they aren&#x27;t beatport (or rather, they don&#x27;t have beatport&#x27;s catalog) reply PaulDavisThe1st 8 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s no difference in the data that will be delivered to you DAC using flac or whatever the non-compressed version was.flac is a lossless format. If it started as 24 bit wav, nothing is lost when you get the flac version of that. it&#x27;s just smaller. reply hatsix 6 hours agorootparentif you digitized at 24 bit, then 16 bit is technically compressed. with flac, the waveforms aren&#x27;t compressed, but the amplitude is, so audio buffs claim they can hear more separation. I can&#x27;t hear it, but I also can&#x27;t taste the difference between coffee bean origins, but I know people who can. reply PaulDavisThe1st 5 hours agorootparentFLAC supports bit depths between 4 and 32 bits per sample (the reference decoders only support up to 24 bits per sampl). Other than that, it does not change the bit depth of the data. reply astrange 4 hours agorootparentprevYou could hear the difference with a 24 to 16 conversion only because it usually involves dithering, which means there is some injected noise. If they choose not to do that, 16-bit dynamic range is enough to store someone whispering in your ear next to a running jet engine. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentAccording charts in google, a jet engine at 100 yards distance is 105dB louder than a whisper. 16 bits can do 96dB without dither.More importantly, the problem isn&#x27;t trying to hear 96dB of range all at once. The baseline is fixed in place, so when you have a quiet section all those high bits are 0 and you need the low bits to have enough detail by themselves. And a whisper is pretty far from the quietest thing you might have in a track.If you can hear the dithering noise, then I&#x27;m pretty sure there are sounds you&#x27;re hearing that would be wrong or missing without the dither. reply astrange 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a binary decision, there are different dithering algorithms with different noise frequencies. reply pdntspa 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure the 16-vs-24 thing has been proven already. 24-bit only really makes sense if you&#x27;re fucking with the material. Same with 44.1khz vs higher sample rates. reply davidgerard 2 hours agorootparentprevthat&#x27;s interesting, sounds like they&#x27;re on a bit of a buying spree too?7Digital is one of those money-losing companies that keeps being passed from owner to owner. reply Kye 11 hours agorootparentprevLossless is mainly for mixing&#x2F;remixing, not listening. reply JohnFen 11 hours agorootparentI disagree. As a listener, the lossy encodings I&#x27;ve heard are fairly annoying, especially in the higher frequencies.I haven&#x27;t heard every lossy encoding, of course, and there may be an actually good one that escaped my attention. reply PaulDavisThe1st 8 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no evidence that more than a very small percentage of humans (if even that) can differentiate between reasonable bit-rate pyscho-acoustic (lossy) compression and the source material.Double-blind tests have made this abundantly clear.If you really can hear a difference, you&#x27;ve either got particularly poorly compressed files, or are in a tiny minority of us. reply barkingcat 5 hours agorootparentA huge portion of all compressed media files are poorly compressed files. Often these poorly compressed files come directly from music distributor with the wrong compression settings, or with really really bad noise. Remember, many music distributors are working with old systems (unable to upgrade either due to driver&#x2F;software or licensing issues), outdated software, and plain old junky audio interfaces, etc.Lossless (when used properly and able to algorithmically guarantee what comes out == what goes into the compression toolchain) avoids the whole issue altogether, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s valuable about it.Focusing on whether compression captures every nuance of uncompressed sound is the wrong battle. The real battle is against careless distributors and bad artifacts introduced by poor compression settings and often incorrectly coded compression utilities used throughout the music industry.(ie we on hn might all be using Lame or the Fraunhofer mp3 encoders, but a lot of music producers&#x2F;distributors will be using custom &#x2F; closed source encoders, or even audio workstations with the encoder implemented in hardware, and those might or might not be encoding mp3 correctly.) reply astrange 4 hours agorootparentWhy are you encoding MP3 at all in 2023? It&#x27;s at least two generations behind the times. (AAC and then Opus) reply barkingcat 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not encoding mp3&#x27;s, but a lot of music is sold as mp3&#x27;s :) reply denkmoon 5 hours agorootparentprevPoorly compressed files is usually the problem, and when lossless files are relatively low burden (what&#x27;s a few gb between friends. I&#x27;m not storing them on my 64gb ipod anymore), i&#x27;d rather just have the lossless ones. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentprevI think you overestimate the median encoding. reply musicale 7 hours agorootparentprevThose bad mp3 cymbals and the wash of noise...Higher bit rates (and probably improved encoders) help though. reply astrange 4 hours agorootparentCymbals in MP3 sound bad due to fundamental limitations of MP3; even high bitrates can&#x27;t fix that.It&#x27;s not a problem in any other codec though. You probably couldn&#x27;t hear the difference in AAC or Opus. reply barkingcat 5 hours agorootparentprevTotally not true. Lossless is for listening! reply musicale 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd transcoding and archiving. reply BLKNSLVR 6 hours agorootparentprev> downloading an app in order to download a file strikes me as a bit grossIt&#x27;s impossible to be a casual user of the Apple ecosystem. There are photos on my kids iPads that I&#x27;d like to save to the family archive, but I can&#x27;t muster up the energy to work out how to do it again.I&#x27;ve done it before but long enough ago that I&#x27;ve forgotten the method but remember the frustration and effort - I know it&#x27;s going to be less than what my exaggerating memory tells me, but... eughhhh, Apple. reply astrange 4 hours agorootparentSelect them, hit the share icon, and send them wherever you want? reply jorams 10 hours agorootparentprevFor an online music store with DRM free downloads I like Qobuz. Available quality depends on the album&#x2F;song, but if something is not on Bandcamp it&#x27;s a good, no-nonsense alternative. reply PeterStuer 4 hours agorootparentprevAlso watermark free? reply CodesInChaos 1 hour agorootparentIs bandcamp watermark free? reply raffraffraff 1 hour agoparentprevBandcamp, 7digital, rarely CDs (but I do still have a USB DVD recorder so I can still rip). And honestly, if I find that something is no longer available (like Spirogyra&#x27;s \"Bells, Boots & Shambles\") and the composer is no longer living, I&#x27;ll take it off something like YouTube if there&#x27;s a decent quality rip available there.

I was very nervous about the Epic deal when it happened (figured it was a way to get the founders and the A-round VCs some money in a cash-out after an incredibly long period of time, similar to what happened to Meetup).But now? Songtradr smells like an investment bank, one that looks at music as \"content\" or \"IP\" and wants to license the hell out of it -- and ultimately, own as much of the rights as possible.They do not strike me as aligned with artist interests, or with the spirit of Bandcamp, which, admittedly, at this late date is mostly a fantasy.Bandcamp represents the last, best refuge for artists in a world where most companies offer you \"exposure,\" what else would you want, stop whining about being paid, etc. Bandcamp means payment.

Artist uploads music, people pay for music and download it. Don&#x27;t change anything.Coudn&#x27;t agree less. Listen: I love Bandcamp and buy a lot of music there. However, it could be so much better. It is far from perfect.For starters: the collection view. It&#x27;s as barebones as possible, just a simple grid of stuff you bought. No way of separating albums and tracks (which is why I don&#x27;t buy single tracks anymore because it just clutters my collection). No way of sorting according to different criteria. No possibility for more compact views (list view, anyone?). I get that lots of people just download stuff and use their own music management software&#x2F;app, but in that case: why is there no way to download stuff in bulk? Sorry, but it&#x27;s simply bad. Another thing that has annoyed me for years is if artists release through labels: If I click on an artist, I want to see their music, not all music from the same label so that I have to painfully look through the whole catalogue to find more music from the same artist. Also, if I want to be notified for new music from that artist, I can only follow the label, so I get notified for everything they release. What kind of insanity is this? With very few exceptions, I don&#x27;t care about labels (sorry label owners, but that&#x27;s just how it is).Another point is discovery: Through Bandcamp, I have discovered way more new music than through any other service just by browsing through new releases and the daily picks. However, there&#x27;s so much more potential here. There already are fans you can follow and artist recommendations, but it&#x27;s just all extremely clunky and discovering people with similar taste in music is basically impossible. Bandcamp has so much information about my musical taste and which artists I like, it should be able to do much more with this. reply thirdsun 2 hours agorootparent> Another thing that has annoyed me for years is if artists release through labels: If I click on an artist, I want to see their music, not all music from the same label so that I have to painfully look through the whole catalogue to find more music from the same artist. Also, if I want to be notified for new music from that artist, I can only follow the label, so I get notified for everything they release. What kind of insanity is this? With very few exceptions, I don&#x27;t care about labels (sorry label owners, but that&#x27;s just how it is).What you describe only happens if a label uses an artist account. Bandcamp introduced label accounts years ago, encourages using them and to my knowledge offers a way to turn artist accounts into label accounts. With a label account both entities, labels and artists, are separated. The label catalogue merely links to the artist&#x27;s release page while the artist&#x27;s account can feature releases on several different labels. Of course the release&#x2F;album page still offers a way back to the label page. It all works as one would expect.Here&#x27;s an example for a release by Matthew Halsall on Gondwana Records using a proper label account: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matthewhalsall.bandcamp.com&#x2F;album&#x2F;an-ever-changing-v... - notice the link to Gondwana Records in the upper left corner. reply Mashimo 2 hours agoparentprev> It&#x27;s perfect as it is.Hell to the no!I primarily use bandcamp for my music, but it&#x27;s most definitively not perfect. I think I use about 3 browser addons for simple quality of life improvements.Sometimes the player is on the top left, sometimes it&#x27;s bound to the bottom, sometimes it&#x27;s inlined and you can only press play without fast forward.I think by default there are no or only a few shortcuts?Playlist only from your collection and mobile only, not on desktop?I lowkey had high hopes for bandcamp when epic bought it. I though the cash would make them rework the UI into a more consistent experience. reply dijksterhuis 5 hours agoparentprev> Don&#x27;t add new features, don&#x27;t enshittify existing features, don&#x27;t make design changes, don&#x27;t do anything. Bandcamp is done, no need for any further changes, just put it in a cabinet and let it run.* after adding a browser player volume slider reply doublerabbit 12 hours agoparentprevGreetings and thank you for expressing your valued concern.

It&#x27;s now EVEN EASIER to take your music anywhere! No more copying files or worrying about backups! reply climb_stealth 11 hours agorootparentprevI appreciate the effort but this was terrifying to read.I think at this point I try to just not care anymore. Software and businesses that are currently great will go to shit and there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it.

    "originBody": "Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures This web site is hosted by the Software and Systems Division, Information Technology Laboratory, NIST. Development of this dictionary started in 1998 under the editorship of Paul E. Black. This is a dictionary of algorithms, algorithmic techniques, data structures, archetypal problems, and related definitions. Algorithms include common functions, such as Ackermann's function. Problems include traveling salesman and Byzantine generals. Some entries have links to implementations and more information. Index pages list entries by area and by type. The two-level index has a total download 1/20 as big as this page. Don't use this site to cheat. Teachers, contact us if we can help. Currently we do not include algorithms particular to business data processing, communications, operating systems or distributed algorithms, programming languages, AI, graphics, or numerical analysis: it is tough enough covering \"general\" algorithms and data structures.If you have suggestions, corrections, or comments, please get in touch with Paul Black. Some terms with a leading variable, such as n-way, m-dimensional, or p-branching, are under k-.

I was sure Fenwick had to be there under another name, but I don&#x27;t see it. Union-find is an even weirder miss, that&#x27;s a _great_ data structure and very useful. I couldn&#x27;t think of any other term it&#x27;d be hiding under.The few I couldn&#x27;t find off the top of my head: square-root decomposition, heavy-light decomposition and really anything at all on Range Minumum Query, one of my favorite general problems (IMO far more interesting than sorting as a group of techniques to focus some time on).> I think this is where I saw union-find: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PGZ64ob440I Except I remember a dictionary&#x2F;hashmap implementation, not a fixed size array.I think you usually see ufds on fixed arrays because it makes the algorithm analysis a bit more interesting.

I do not remember if we covered it but I was already exposed to industry at that time and was far more advanced in the practical than the rest of the class.The benefits of algorithm selection only really started to become apparent after years of experience and know-how in what _exactly_ an application requires or intends to be used as.

    "originBody": "Hey all,You&#x27;ve probably seen projects that add objects to an image from a style or text prompt, like InteriorAI (levelsio) and Adobe Firefly. The prevalent issue with these diffusion-based inpainting approaches is that they don&#x27;t yet have great conditioning on lighting, perspective, and structure. You&#x27;ll often get incorrect or generic shadows; warped-looking objects; and distorted backgrounds.What is Fill 3D? Fill 3D is an exploration on doing generative fill in 3D to render ultra-realistic results that harmonize with the background image, using industry-standard path tracing, akin to compositing in Hollywood movies.How does it work? 1. Deproject: First, deproject an image to a 3D shell using both geometric and photometric cues from the input image. 2. Place: Draw rectangles and describe what you want in them, akin to Photoshop&#x27;s Generative Fill feature. 3. Render: Use good ol&#x27; path tracing to render ultra-realistic results.Why Fill 3D? + The results are insanely realistic (see video in the github repo, or on the website). + Fast enough: Currently, generations take 40-80 seconds. Diffusion takes ~10seconds, so we&#x27;re slower, but for the level of realism, it&#x27;s pretty good. + Potential applications: I&#x27;m thinking of virtual staging in real estate media, what do you think?Check it out at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fill3d.ai + There&#x27;s API access! :D + Right now, you need an image of an empty room.

Right now, we&#x27;re using the Blenderkit dialog, but we can expand beyond it. When you type a prompt and search though, that&#x27;s actually doing a multi-modal search (so you can ask for a &#x27;red painting&#x27; and it&#x27;ll actually find a red painting), so it&#x27;s insanely more accurate than a regular search.

Because we generate in 3D, users can bring their own 3D models and add it to the catalog. And if you add something like object capture from Apple (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;augmented-reality&#x2F;object-capture...), you could literally scan your couch, upload it to Fill 3D, place, and generate.Exciting times ahead. reply RockRobotRock 8 hours agoprevHave real estate companies considered leaving a house unfurnished and letting potential buyers put on AR goggles to see what it would look like with their furniture? reply sci_prog 7 hours agoparentOr could just use a phone&#x2F;tablet as a \"viewport\".

And yes, because we&#x27;re using actual 3D models, there&#x27;s a fixed set of models (right now, just under 300). Because the priority is ultra-realism, the current state-of-the-art for 3D model diffusion won&#x27;t cut it (see OpenAI Point-e https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openai&#x2F;point-e). reply billconan 12 hours agorootparentso you only project the background into a 3d model, and the foreground is not generated, but 3d models?the bug I saw was after uploading a background image, on the right side, I only saw a generate and a reset button, nothing else. I clicked \"generate\", expecting it to ask me to input a prompt, but it started to render and the result was the same background I uploaded. reply olokobayusuf 11 hours agorootparentYes that&#x27;s correct. And for using it, you have to draw rectangles before you can add a prompt, similar to Photoshop&#x27;s generative fill UI. Check out the video on the landing page.

Or, shoot me an email: yusuf@fill3d.ai reply blovescoffee 11 hours agoprevCould you speak more to the \"deprojection\" step? What is that? reply olokobayusuf 11 hours agoparentFill 3D takes a different step from diffusion, in that it tries to build an actual 3D scene (kinda like a clone) of what&#x27;s in the image you upload. In some sense, that&#x27;s actually the most fundamental representation of what&#x27;s in your image (or said another way, your image is just a representation of that original scene).So it works by trying to estimate a 3D &#x27;room&#x27; that matches your image. Everything from the geometry, to the light fixtures, to the windows. It&#x27;s heavily inspired by how humans (weird to contrast &#x27;human&#x27; vs. AI work) do image&#x2F;video compositing.TL;DR: Image in, 3D scene out. reply blovescoffee 11 hours agorootparentCould you elaborate on how that&#x27;s done technically?

Right now, the very first stage (deprojecting the image to 3D) makes assumptions about the image having the structure of a room: large empty floor plan; roughly polygonal geometry.For different kinds of images, it&#x27;s a question of using other cues to build a 3D structure that&#x27;s very close to the original image.

I get that people are excited about new tech, and technical people always overestimate the value of technical advancements in creative workflows, but no: people being able to place a perfect hyper-realistic replica of themselves in a film wouldn&#x27;t kill the film industry any more than RPG Maker + generative AI would kill the games industry. I&#x27;d wager it probably would not even leave a dent.Firstly, there would need to be a film to begin with, and that requires a lot. A whole hell of a lot.Secondly, characters matter. A lot. Especially main characters. Do you replace the name of the main character with your name in stories you tell? How about doing a global search-and-replace in the ebooks you read? It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t have the technical capability. I could see this being a novelty feature in some action movies, especially superhero movies, and more likely in games and porn, but one of the biggest draws a movie has is who stars in it-- and if you look at the rest of the human population, you&#x27;ll notice that we&#x27;re not choosing representative samples. The fact that it&#x27;s someone else with a personality and back story and motives and strengths and flaws-- a character-- is a pretty important part of stories. Their appearance matters, too. Most people don&#x27;t even like staring at themselves for a few minutes, let alone for an entire feature length film. In most situations, I think it would be distracting as hell. Sure, people might find it amusing to see themselves in Top Gun Maverick, but would they want to see themselves getting bullied by an IRS agent in Everything Everywhere All at Once? Getting a box cutter held to their throat in Emily the Criminal? Would replacing Jon Hamm&#x27;s appearance with their own really make watching Madmen better? Do most people want to see themselves beat to a pulp in Fight Club? I&#x27;d wager that few would.Thirdly, most people aren&#x27;t particularly interested in putting in the thought and effort to customize their phones: I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re less interested in putting thought and effort into customizing their passive entertainment. They just want to hit play and have a nice little escape.So, no. As long as people will continue to seek entertainment for the reasons they&#x27;ve always sought it, this is not going to fundamentally change the art of storytelling anytime soon. reply hoosieree 11 hours agoparentprev[pitching to investors]It&#x27;s like Joan is Awful, but for AirBnB. reply SeanAnderson 11 hours agoprevThat&#x27;s an awfully brown colored pink bed in the demo :)The tech itself looks amazing though, well done. reply olokobayusuf 8 hours agoparentI was hoping you wouldn&#x27;t notice ;)Don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s more options.

Say it&#x27;s an API hookup and some automation between some tools.2) You submit your project for prioritization by the dev department.3) It gets done 9 months later. The specs are wrong because there were so many layers between the marketer and developer and the developer has no context for the project. You submit edits which get prioritized and takes another few months.ORYou get Zapier approved by security once. Then for every project like this you fiddle with it until it does what you want. Total time: A couple of weeks.No code removes friction from the org.Developer time is always the biggest bottleneck at any org I&#x27;ve worked with. Anything that let&#x27;s you get around it is worth its weight in gold. reply austin-cheney 11 hours agoparentNo sympathy as this is entirely a self-inflicted wound.The problem is that very few people, at each stage, are qualified to be there. Let’s not kid ourselves with pride and self-congratulatory bullshit about how awesome we are. Most people require several layers of abstractions to do their jobs to cover competencies they should know but don’t both in technology and marketing.The reason this occurs is because there is no baseline of competence in software, so everything becomes wildly subjective and therefore biased. To solve for that business imposes tools to make things easier, but really it’s to commoditize candidate selection. That eliminates some amount of training costs up front but instead requires a larger labor pool with lower product flexibility. More people of lower competence with far less ability to pivot as requirements change and everything takes longer.No code is just an extension of this problem because it still requires developers, internal to your company, to maintain and extend the no code solution under the same limitations as before. reply Nostromos 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s easy to describe this as self-inflicted when you don&#x27;t understand how large orgs work and have never had to consider how a security team deals with a large org, each piece wanting their own version (or multiple versions) of this solution.Qualification isn&#x27;t the issue because we (the US, US tech, SF&#x2F;NY, etc.) have a lot of qualified talent, both in eng and elsewhere. The issue you describe with competence IS an issue but not for this. Your final sentence is correct but not right.Basically, you&#x27;re right and you&#x27;re wrong and I should probably write something longer form but won&#x27;t get to it for months. I&#x27;ll give you an upvote in lieu of that for making me think deeper about the topic. reply Nostromos 5 hours agorootparentAnd after re-reading my first sentence, I apologize for suggesting you don&#x27;t understand how large orgs work. That wasn&#x27;t fair and I don&#x27;t know your background. I&#x27;m gonna leave the post unedited for honesty&#x27;s sake. reply lucasyvas 5 hours agorootparentprev> No code is just an extension of this problem because it still requires developers, internal to your company, to maintain and extend the no code solution under the same limitations as before.I don&#x27;t want to dismiss this point, because it&#x27;s real. But there is an alternative.I&#x27;ve been brought into these talks with other departments before, and I evaluate the tool from an engineering perspective. If they want to use a true no-code solution, we don&#x27;t block it but raise to the director level that we will under no circumstances support the use of the tool - we are developers by trade and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re paid for, so they are responsible for everything to do with it and bear all responsibility if it fails to adapt.If it&#x27;s low code and has an API, we generally much prefer that because it means we can actually deploy and properly maintain the code that might be needed to support integration with it.We don&#x27;t copy and paste fucking code and we don&#x27;t drag around UI elements with if-else statements - it&#x27;s simply not our profession. You wouldn&#x27;t ask a carpenter to assemble IKEA furniture. It&#x27;s a waste of money and time.So yes, the solutions might \"need\" a developer, but no sane director would allocate one. It makes no sense. reply HeyLaughingBoy 13 hours agoparentprevI never really got this until I was talking to a scientist in our organization and she was bemoaning the fact that it was taking her team hours to do some basic analysis of files that our instrument exported.\"So why don&#x27;t you make a request for Software to add that data to the file?

She had been waiting over a year for my software team to get the go-ahead to do it as a built-in feature. And this was taking a biochemist on average 3 hours every day to do by hand! reply BeetleB 12 hours agorootparent> Took me an afternoon to write a simple C# tool to ingest a number of files and spit out the data that she needed. She had been waiting over a year for my software team to get the go-ahead to do it as a built-in feature.The counter to this is that this tool now has no support (which may be fine depending on the tool).I remember my first job which was 30% SW and 70% other engineering. We wrote a few tools to automate stuff that our customers used.One of our customers came to my manager and told us he had a tool we wrote over 5 years prior. It was a small Perl script. Their data source had changed formatting a bit and now the script no longer worked. They wanted us to update the script. Several hours were spent between the two teams arguing. My manager did not want to own it. He said he had no record of it, and none of the people on his team had any memory of it. We did not own it. They kept insisting \"One of the engineers in your team (who had since left the company) wrote it, so you own it!\"I pointed out to the coworker that the request was so trivial we could have solved it in under an hour, and the company had lost more money by arguing. The counter was \"If we fix it, they&#x27;ll keep coming back to us and in the long run more money would be lost.\"Over the years, I&#x27;ve realized how right he is.I do occasionally write simple scripts to help our customers, but management always makes it clear to them that this is an unsupported prototype, and the customer needs to maintain it. reply HeyLaughingBoy 12 hours agorootparentAnd that&#x27;s a perfectly valid rebuttal. Over time, she occasionally asked for more features, and I obliged as time permitted. The requests were always reasonable, and I checked the source into our generic \"Tools\" repository in case someone else ever took it over.The bigger problem I saw was the shortsightedness of the organization. The software group had a history of writing small test tools for other groups, but no one ever considered listening to what she was asking for and checking if there was another way of getting the data besides changing the Product itself. It&#x27;s always easier to just say No, even when there&#x27;s a clear benefit to someone else. reply mvdtnz 10 hours agorootparentprevThey came back to you once after 5 years, what makes you think it would get worse over time? reply RileyJames 7 hours agorootparentAnd if by worse, it’s one hour every year, the argument is still a worse trade off for both time and customer & employee morale. reply BeetleB 5 hours agorootparentprev\"Past outcomes are not indicative of future results\" Just because they came back after 5 years doesn&#x27;t mean it will be 5 years before they come back again. It was, in fact, quite unpredictable. We didn&#x27;t want to be on the hook every time their data source changed the format of the data. If this work is so important, they need to work with the team pumping out the data to have it standardized and stable.This was in an org that was sorely lacking programming talent, and management clearly did not want to hire SW engineers. There was always a lot more work than there were engineers for, so it was a continuous battle of demarcating boundaries. If you start doing SW favors, everyone will want it from you, and will push the upper managers to force you (or your team) to do it. None of this will matter for promotions, because SW was secondary to our jobs. Without a hard stance, you&#x27;ll drown.As another commenter said, it was an incentives problem. Right or wrong, good or bad, helping people with small scripts was not something that would ever be rewarded.It was also a matter of principle: If you do someone a favor, and they come back to you with an attitude and insist you owe them because you did them a favor, you stop doing those favors for them. That was something I would see often in that org (even outside of SW work): If you do work for someone, they expect you to own it.Overall, the culture was poor. But I&#x27;ve found elements of it in most jobs.Judging from the comments, it&#x27;s evident I wasn&#x27;t clear enough: When I said \"our customer\", I did not mean an external customer, but an internal team. We were a service&#x2F;expertise department that helped various teams in the company with our expertise (and the expertise was not software). This was all informal - there was no monetary accounting&#x2F;SLAs for our services. reply Brian_K_White 9 hours agorootparentprevJust bill for it, support and all. Make the customer say no. Or if they&#x27;re willing to pay then great.It&#x27;s terrible customer support for the company to give them something one day and then deny all responsibility another day.Even if the original team shouldn&#x27;t have done it, they already did and it was never the customers fault.The manager was not right at all, and this comes from no newbie who just hasn&#x27;t been around that block yet. reply Spooky23 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s all a power dynamic.Saying no is a power move that gives you street cred in the organization.

Not my job, not my problem. reply hooverd 12 hours agorootparentprevI think some teams could do really well to have an embedded developer- someone who can understand both fields decently enough. reply analog31 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been in that role. It&#x27;s utterly thankless. You will experience every way that the devs and non-devs can&#x27;t work together. The devs will treat you like a scab. You&#x27;ll discover all of the non-technical reasons why it&#x27;s hard to be a dev, without being paid like one.Today, my rule is that I only code for myself, and share my code with others who are also good coders. I&#x27;ll use code to produce a result and share the result. This also lets me off the hook from all sorts of things like UI&#x27;s, installers, etc.Anybody who&#x27;s a good enough dev to do it for money, and can stand doing it, should be.Edit: Thinking about it more, it&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t work together as people but that the organizational culture makes it hard. reply Sylamore 5 hours agorootparentprevWhile I agree in principal, speaking as someone who&#x27;s been that person it creates a lot of stress when it&#x27;s just one person. You never get a break from enhancing or fixing and maintaining the tools that the rest of the team is using, and probably lose opportunities in your \"other\" skills. You&#x27;ll probably get no support from the actual dev groups in the company, never get funding to hire a contractor (which almost never works out anyway), potentially end up stuck career wise because if the tools are really useful your manager isn&#x27;t gonna want to lose you to a promotion.A small \"tools\" team shared across some related disciplines under common leadership would be more ideal in my experience, but normally it&#x27;s either beg for the real dev teams scraps or go rogue.I like using code to solve problems and automate things, but I have no desire to be a full time coder just like I don&#x27;t have a strong desire to be a people manager. reply jwsteigerwalt 11 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been in that role and it’s incredibly rewarding. The satisfaction from delivering something valuable to the sales leaders I partner with when they get something they genuinely appreciate trumps any commit dashboard. reply projectileboy 12 hours agorootparentprevAnother example of: you can’t manage what you can’t measure, but be careful what you measure because that’s what you get. Alternately: measuring cost is easy, measuring value is hard. So we don’t hire another dev because that’s expensive, whereas I don’t see all the time wasted by the people I already employ. Having said all that, it’s a hard problem, and I’m not sure what general advice can be applied. reply MichaelZuo 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is a great example, thanks for sharing.Too many folks on HN claim that normal companies are close to as efficient as they can be. It&#x27;s nowhere near close, more like hundred dollar bills lying on the floor everywhere in nearly every office. reply pier25 10 hours agorootparentprevI had the opposite experience.At a previous company, one dev spent about 2-3 hours every single day to download PDFs with bank reports and then manually doing the conciliation.I thought this was ridiculous. One afternoon I made a quick desktop app where he could drop the PDFs and get some JSONs back with all the data. The idea was that he then could semi automate the concilition with those JSONs.Years later I left that company and he still was wasting all that time doing manual conciliation. reply shpongled 4 hours agorootparentThat sounds like a major skill or motivation issue.I wouldn&#x27;t want a \"dev\" who spent 2-3 hours a day doing something like this manually working with me. reply charlie0 9 hours agorootparentprevYep, adoption is another major issue. I&#x27;m shocked at the number of people who continue wasting hours because they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t want to learn the newer faster way. reply creakingstairs 6 hours agorootparentIt’s learned helplessness. They learned that doing the job faster is not only reward-less but only gets them more work. reply drpossum 14 hours agoparentprevHaving been on the \"actually has to deal with the aftermath of investing in no-code\" that is when the cost comes in. Out of the literally dozen or so places I&#x27;ve worked and the half of those that went heavy on low code, it has never worked. The complexity becomes too great after a few months of \"wins\" and the system falls over on itself because the people using low code need increasingly complex things. But I assume as a marketer once you&#x27;ve finished your sale you move on to the next one. Because that what they all did. reply cm2012 14 hours agorootparentThe trick is to use the no code implementation to learn what you need to build from scratch. Don&#x27;t think of it as expensive time to redo - think of it as valuable work finding out what your org actually needed. I&#x27;m sure you know that people don&#x27;t even know what they need when they send developers their brief half the time.It&#x27;s like excel. Yes excel is used for all sorts of messy things its not ideal for, and would be better built by a programmer. But the excel file teaches the developer what their co workers actually need the product to do. It&#x27;s not wasted time, it&#x27;s invaluable. reply mellosouls 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a good observation but falls apart if actual developers have to maintain the Rube-Goldberg app created by well-meaning \"Citizen Developers\" (© Acme No-Code Corp) using a framework which is only intended for prototypes but not fit for purpose beyond that.Of course, that&#x27;s a management issue - but managers who are easily taken in by consultancy sweet talk about the power of these frameworks are not always the most likely to understand the problems they cause or have the wisdom or resources to clean up afterwards by doing what you suggest. reply leejoramo 11 hours agorootparentprevThe most successful projects I have been on started with a smart manager, admin, engineer or other non-programmer who used Excel, FileMaker, FrontPage or the like.

But nothing can replace lost time in a competitive industry. reply hftthw 12 hours agorootparentIt also means tens of millions of losses when the data pipeline falls over silently.My first job out of university was to work on a compliance tool after someone used yahoo finance for exchange rates in a business critical spreadsheet. The losses were large enough to threaten the viability of the company.Picking pennies in front of steamrolles is a pretty good description of putting no code in production. reply marcus_holmes 8 hours agoparentprevThis is the reason we have desktop computers. Lotus 123 (and then Excel) enabled ordinary folks automate bits of their jobs.But it went through a pattern:- Spreadsheet was created to help do task X- Spreadsheet grew until task X was entirely contained in the spreadsheet- New hires were trained to just use the spreadsheet instead of understanding the task- The person who built the spreadsheet left the department- The business needed a change in the task, and that meant changing the spreadsheet. But no-one in the department knew how the spreadsheet worked any more.- The IT department gets a new urgent task to change the spreadsheet to allow for the change in the task. The spreadsheet is a complete mess of spaghetti, evolved over years with no documentation. It will take months of work to untangle it and make the necessary changes (and document it for next time). The developers pitch that they could build a VB app for the task in less time than solving the spreadsheet and that would improve the situation going forward.- The IT department kicks off a project to build the VB app. Immediately the business department adds a ton of loosely-related requirements because they&#x27;ve always wanted them in the spreadsheet but no-one knew how to add them.- The project founders under its own bloated weight, scope creep moving it from a couple months out to a year&#x27;s project.- Meanwhile the business department works out another way of doing the task- 18 months later the IT department delivers the app as promised. But it&#x27;s wildly out of date with what the business department is doing now, so no longer fits the use case it was designed for.I&#x27;ve seen this happen a few times. It&#x27;ll be the same with Zapier-derived solutions - in two years you&#x27;ll have left the organisation and then an API changes and the thing you built falls apart, no-one knows how to fix it, and devs don&#x27;t want to look at it. Everything is more painful this way. It&#x27;s worth its weight in gold until suddenly it turns to shit. reply foxbee 2 hours agorootparentThis is a great example. Low-code is not the solution to everything, like spreadsheets were not the solution to everything.With low-code, it really does help if the platform is easily extendible and open source.

Oil & Gas loves data and excel. Everything starts with Excel, and when it outgrows Excel the next step is getting developers to build a better solution.

You can replace the low-code solution with a junior coder in a non-coding role. Creating a shadow-IT solution will be a fraction of the cost and time.

Most of the cost in software comes from maintenance of legacy systems. I hope this new no-code solution is something a department has decided to maintain indefinitely! I my experience, after the marketing person quits, the no-code solution gets chucked across the fence to IT, the no-code provider stops supporting their tool, and IT is forced to build a new one as an emergency a few years later because “the business has been using it for years.”In a healthy org, if something is truly good for the business and will create global gains across the company, it should hop to the top of the priority list. Admittedly, I’m still hunting for this theoretical healthy org, though. reply dgellow 14 hours agoparentprev> No code removes friction from the org.That’s so true.

For a while it does what is needed and becomes a critical part of the marketing workflow.2) New requirements come in, maybe it needs to integrate with a new API or database. Marketer is too busy marketing to waste time with all that plumbing. Thankfully there&#x27;s a department full of people whose literal job is dealing with all this crap: the developers! The no-code project is thrown over the wall and some coders are assigned the task of rat-wrestling with the no-code tool, as well as writing code against their crufty, idiosyncratic API -- code that cannot be tested using their usual testing tools because it must all live within the no-code runtime -- to fill in the gaps in the tool&#x27;s functionality. Their productivity grinds to a near halt. This becomes their job for months to years because the no-code workflow is Mission Critical, Essential to the Business, and if it breaks or cannot be made to do what is needed billions are at stake.3) That thing you wanted takes 9 months to complete because now the dev team has all the no-code cruft on top of their work building actual software for the business.Please, for the love of God, just do us all a favor and learn some Python.

They tried to push as much logic as possible into Microsoft SQL Server stored procedures (the average length was around 10 pages). Look at all the code that wasn’t written (because SQL doesn’t count), and less code means less bugs!Where stored procedures wouldn’t do, they put these of the logic into SQL Server Integration Services, which provided a visual programming environment — think Scratch but for visually connecting ETL pipelines. But, invariably, the existing components wouldn’t suffice, so they’d stuff 100s of pages of C# into these components, which would be hidden away behind a little “code block” rectangle in the SSIS flow-diagram-esque interface. Zero code reuse, no way to run unit tests, no strong typing (beyond primitive types mapped 1-to-1 with the underlying SQL queries), no codification of invariants&#x2F;preconditions&#x2F;etc. But hey, that C# code hidden away doesn’t count as code, so look at all the code we avoided! And SSIS is from Microsoft, so by using something they bless then we must be on the right track! What’s that you said? Should we consider if this particular tool is appropriate for our particular needs? No way! If SSIS wasn’t the optimal tool for all problems, why would Microsoft develop and market this product?!Anyway. I think the trap people fall into is this: Critical thinking is tiring, and many people are lazy. Putting such people in a position that they must actually weigh the merits of multiple options is a sure fire way to become deeply resented. Also, critical thinking makes you responsible for the consequences of your choices, whereas appealing to authority absolves you of any and all responsibility (the old saying “no one was ever fired for buying IBM”). So many attempt to reduce the amount code as much as possible. But the problem is that many worthwhile endeavors are inherently difficult, and require real, hard, critical thought to arrive at a solution, and for such things code often happens to be the best medium for reifying those thoughts into software solutions. Consequently, countless companies will choose to jump through no-code hoops, and unsurprisingly suffer the consequences. They won’t learn from it though: instead, those responsible will deflect with excuses like “well Zapier is the issue, you see”, or “imagine how much longer it would have taken if we actually coded the solution!”, or “that’s just the nature of software&#x2F;tech”, etc. reply BLanen 13 hours agoprevAny truly capable no code development environment will (d)evolve into a shitty visual programming language without the tooling you expect from a modern language. reply Buttons840 12 hours agoparentI wonder if it being \"visual\" makes business owners more likely to look at the logic and realize \"wow, this is a mess, let&#x27;s simplify this\".

Also, while it is much less of a performance boost compared to darcs, git still benefits in some cases of pack file delta compression&#x2F;optimization due to smaller differences in \"musdexed\" text&#x2F;XML files rather than binary containers.I have one public example of this on my GitHub that comes to mind, but it&#x27;s a particularly weird one because it uses a musdex plugin to extract&#x2F;combine an already non-binary format. (In this case it was an Inform 7 story.ni file that I just preferred to source control as lots of smaller, column-wrapped \"chapter\" files rather than one long \"book\" file of run-on paragraphs. GitHub&#x27;s cool modern code browser hasn&#x27;t been taught how to do jump to section for Inform 7 story.ni files, so it is nice being able to browse it as a file tree instead. Similar it&#x27;s nice to see commit diffs broken down by chapter. I can&#x27;t install my own Inform 7 plugin to GitHub&#x27;s website, but I can certainly reshape my repo with a tool like musdex.) reply ebiester 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat they lose is a long history and community knowledge of hacks. What they gain is data integrity, consistency, and concurrency.We need to think about a tool that can do those with the same ease as Excel (Or Access).

I’ve given them the benefit of the doubt and been burned repeatedly.Don’t tar all no&#x2F;low code tools with the same brush though. I’ve had good success with Retool, for example. reply wonderwonder 10 hours agoprevOP is right and wrong. I am currently a technical lead on a highly complex build that has been in development for a couple years now. A good chunk is in production, tens of millions of complicated &#x27;product&#x27; is moved through the system every year. This will eventually scale to billions. Not making that number up, its the existing volume that will be moved over from the myriad of legacy systems we currently use as we build additional functionality.We are using lots of consultants and they are very expensive. They also don&#x27;t build with the same quality as our in house teams.I can build any app I could during my full stack days quicker with no code. Obviously there are some limits but I have not had to deal with them and they are edge cases in the day to day of a web developer.It definitely helps to know how to build software and there is a world of difference between the work produced with the tool by a developer and someone that has not coded before.I went into it expecting to very much dislike it and that it would only allow for toy development. It blew me away.A team of devs that know how to architect software and this is the key; plan well, can crush projects with this. With that said, if you don&#x27;t plan and just go in and start building its incredibly easy to build a mess of non maintainable spaghetti no code. reply simonbarker87 13 hours agoprevNo code is great for an experiment - I’ll throw together a zap or two to test something and if it sticks I’ll then port it to code and properly integrate it into the system.It’s not a case of “redoing all the work” it’s about helping to know we are doing the right work. reply trunnell 11 hours agoprevIME a huge part of the cost of development (regardless of code&#x2F;no-code tool choice) is the time spent gathering requirements and continuously validating them.When the user and developer are the same people, the cost of finding the requirements can sometimes be nearly zero. In this case, that person will themselves choose the best tool for them. And the development cost will be very cheap -- for example, think of a short script you wrote to do something just for you.But when the user and developer are different people, much care should be taken to avoid cost explosion. To the outside this can look like \"coding is expensive!\" which is kinda true, but really it&#x27;s the requirements discovery that dominates the cost. People don&#x27;t understand each other perfectly, can sometimes talk past each other, etc. Iterative development&#x27;s purpose is to mitigate the problem of building for the wrong requirements.No-code tools can unblock \"developers\" who own the requirements but don&#x27;t have programming skills. That might make those projects very cheap. Or it could do the opposite: if the non-programmers don&#x27;t know think carefully about what they&#x27;re building, then they might end up spending just as much time as programmers would have as they iterate towards a complete solution. reply quickthrower2 11 hours agoparentThe issue is “requirements”. With a nocode system a person can create something that solves their immediate problem. Which is usually to get something done quickly that their boss wants so they don’t get fired (sorry too honest?). But things built that way usually wont end up being efficient ir maintainable. Everyone self servicing bespoke “code like” setups leads to a mess. There is a level of polish before self service makes sense to me. For example using dropbox is OK. Making a dropbox like thing in Bubble is probably bad! reply parentheses 5 hours agoprevAs a person who uses low&#x2F;no code platforms to ship real products I fully disagree with this.Low code and no code platforms can do a lot to make implementing back office functions easier. It enables things that you&#x27;d deprioritize without these tools. That said, they also need to be managed like software: versioning, beta releases, risk mitigation, tech debt trade offs.While there are things that can go wrong with these tools, they do strictly make things easier rather than harder. reply zubairq 6 hours agoprevReminds me of the 1990s. The amount of work for consultants to build business solutions with no code or low code tools was staggering, including Borland Delphi, Visual Basic, Excel, MS Access, SqlWindows, Powerbuilder, and many others. I don&#x27;t know if I agree with that they cost \"3-10x more\" than building the solution with code, as often these projects would never have been started if they were built with normal code, as the decision process is totally different in most organisations (eg: related to skills and maintaining the software) reply jrockway 12 hours agoprevI think the solution that you&#x27;re paying for here is the burstable capacity. Dev teams often end up with a backlog of 100 internal requests, and all of them are \"the highest priority\", well, if you have 1 thing doer and 100 things to do, they can&#x27;t all be processed at once. But if you get 100 consultants, then they can do all 100 high priority items in parallel. The other edge of this sword, though, is that they want real money. Your manager is going to have to approve an expense report. Suddenly, it&#x27;s actually possible to break the list down into actually high enough priority to pay 10x for, and just \"nice to have\".That said, I&#x27;m not sure it really helps. The infrastructure to allow these consultants to be productive is going to be expensive; the dev team has to provide a safe API for these integrations, and an API \"that could be used for anything\" is harder to design than writing code for a particular use case. (Then again, I bet a lot of these teams get a request like \"can you just give us a read only replica of your database\" and get \"sure\" back. It will be 1 year before they realize they just lost their SOC2 compliance and their website has been lying this whole time.) reply neeleshs 11 hours agoprevOne unsaid thing - developer salaries.Far too often (myself included) we ignore that our own salaries are a cost reply wmidwestranger 13 hours agoprevSounds very similar to the complexity increase described in The Mythical Man Month.The author describes how the complexity increases as a system expands in a greater than linear, and expected, fashion. So, a simple script might cost one. Adding configuration costs 3. A framework for solving similar problems might cost 9, and a platform for frameworks probably costs an unexpected large amount, like 27.I&#x27;ve mostly seen this pop-up along with Xeno&#x27;s paradox. A rewrite of a legacy system is undertaken and the planners completely discount all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the original. Every problem is considered \"solved\" and using newer tech is seen as a silver bullet. The cost is severely underestimated and the effort is way beyond initial estimates. reply great_psy 10 hours agoprevI only have one experience with no-code and that is trying to make something in the Shortcuts app for iPhone.I tried to make a password generator.

[1][1] also lists Percentage of On-Time Customers by Route – 2022 which clearly shows that it&#x27;s abysmal.See the report card [2] where they have put in 80% as the benchmark.IIRC, I had also seen a full historical report across multiple years but can&#x27;t find it now. We recently did a trip going from SFO to LAX to San Diego by Coast Starlight and the Surfliner.

It would only be slightly better as 2022 reports state it has deteriorated further as compared to 2021.The lesson we learn from looking at all this on time data and checking out some other forums was that when traveling by Amtrak, budget for delays, cancellations, re-reouting by bus and all the pain that comes with it.We come from the UK and are train lovers, having done most of the train travel in UK and Europe, Amtrak has a lot to do to catch up.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amtrak.com&#x2F;about-amtrak&#x2F;on-time-performance.html[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amtrak.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;projects&#x2F;dotcom&#x2F;english&#x2F;p... reply chaps 3 hours agorootparentThis site has historical data -- just use wildcards... and then write a scraper :)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juckins.net&#x2F;amtrak_status&#x2F;archive&#x2F;html&#x2F;history.php reply chaps 3 hours agorootparentprevUm.

There are many small railroad that art more densely packed around a metro area or within one small state. For instance, you can get from Newark, DE to Springfield, MA entirely on regional trains: SEPTA from Newark, DE through Philadelphia, PA to Trenton, NJ; NJ Transit from Trenton to Penn Station in New York City; NYC subway from Penn Station to Grand Central Terminal (if you have a heavy luggage, otherwise just walk), Metro North from GCT to New Haven, CT; Hartford Line CT Rail from New Haven, CT to Springfield, MA.Each leg of that trip on a commuter train probably had 5 to 25 stops in between stations I mentioned, and each of those rail systems branches out in various directions to serve the commuters of that area getting into the cities I mention. Amtrak also runs about the same route with way fewer stops.The US used to be more rail dense.

Technically the Amtrak passenger train has priority over freight, but one problem is that when one train needs to bypass another, the freight trains are often too long to fit on the siding, so the Amtrak train must wait instead. reply xenadu02 12 hours agorootparent> the freight trains are often too long to fit on the sidingThis is a deliberate part of \"precision scheduled railroading\" which is neither precision nor scheduled.Management and investors believe railroads are in long-term decline so capital investments to improve capacity and&#x2F;or speed are not done. The most important metric is the \"operating ratio\". If serving a new customer that adds $200m to profit would decrease the ratio by 2% the railroad will not serve the customer.So as part of this the railroad wants to minimize crew time. On a given section of track with passing sidings the railroad could move more cars by having three train crews going back and forth, creating conists just long enough to fit in the sidings. They could also extend the sidings to allow longer trains.Instead they reduce to two or even one crew and make longer consists. This often means one crew parks their train and leaves it for an entire day because they won&#x27;t be able to pass the other train in the opposite direction. The crew has to take a taxi back home and leaves the train idle. Once the other train passes they or another crew comes back and resumes. It now takes 3 days to move the same number of cars it would have taken two before but over those three days the railroad only paid for 1.5 crew days instead of paying 3 crews over two days. Labor costs are reduced, operating ratio looks better, job done.I&#x27;ll also point out that US railroad companies hate carrying passengers. They spent decades begging permission to discontinue passenger service, cooking books, refusing to sell tickets, etc so they could discontinue their passenger services. For example what is Caltrain used to run down to LA and was very profitable right up until the day they terminated service.edit: When management and investors punish railroads for trying to be a better railroad I don&#x27;t know how you fix that brain damage.

Afaik, there&#x27;s no place with large rail coverage where there&#x27;s one rail network for freight and one rail network for passengers; a lot of the world has rail for passengers and lacks significant rail for freight, the US has rail for freight and lacks significant rail for passengers. The two use cases don&#x27;t mix well.If you want to get somewhere in the US in a reasonable amount of time at a reasonable cost, your options are usually roads (bus or personal vehicle) and commercial air travel. There&#x27;s a couple corridors where boat or train actually work, but not many. reply bobthepanda 12 hours agorootparentChina has both.Transcon rail will never be a thing but most people live in areas close by. The Midwest is roughly the size of France with similar population levels; and the upper limit of high speed rail travel is thought to be about five hours on the train, which is compatible with NYC to Chicago, or Chicago to Atlanta, or NYC to Atlanta, not to mention all the shorter trips in between. reply sofixa 9 minutes agorootparentEven more than 5 hours - I&#x27;ve taken the Paris to Milan and Paris to Barcelona trains multiple times (6:30-7h), and both are relatively frequent, quite full, and competitive with air travel due to a number of factors even if they&#x27;re slightly slower (for Paris-Milan depending on departure point and airport on both ends, you&#x27;re looking at 30-60 mins per direction, plus being 2 hours early at the airport, plus the time to get from the gate to the train station to get out of the airport, plus 1h30 flight and you&#x27;re looking at 5-6h for the plane vs 7h for the train):* vastly more comfortable, with more space and amenities* nice views* single style of hassle (get to the train, sit down, enjoy; with a plane you get to the terminal, pass through security, then wait, then go in a plane in heavily restricted mode, then you can move&#x2F;do stuff after take-off, then again you go in restricted mode, then you wait for taxi to finish, then you get to the gate, then you walk towards the exits, wait for luggage, etc.) reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentprevThose \"shorter routes\" are where things could shine, even if you don&#x27;t go high-speed a train from MSP to CHI through Milwaukee would see some use. reply thriftwy 12 hours agorootparentprevRussia (and some other ex-USSR states) has a large amount of passenger rail (long distance, commuter and the new thing that is daytime quick inter-regional trains) and also a large amount of freight as well.It helps that most of main lines are electrified twin tracks.With regards for competitiveness, once it&#x27;s in it becomes vital infrastructure that nobody asks questions about. Like nobody asks \"are the USA interstates competitive\". They&#x27;re there so that country as a whole remains competitive. reply bobthepanda 11 hours agorootparentprevThe long distance west coast trains are a lot longer than 1000km, though. The Empire Builder from Chicago to Seattle is 3600km. reply thriftwy 11 hours agorootparentNot the best option for those, then. Amtrak seems to be in \"excursion mode\" where they would promote routes that are way too long but scenic, instead of aiming to join many mid-population proximate cities and make sure passengers regularly get there on schedule.Long routes have their uses, but the bread and butter of any popular system should be the trains which leave in the evening and arrive the next morning. You do not lose a day and you do not have to pay for a hotel. reply bobthepanda 11 hours agorootparentThe problem is that Amtrak has two conflicting dual mandates:* make a “profit”* run essential 3km+ long distance services. These often serve rural areas without parallel Interstate routesAnd has never been given the appropriate amount of money to do both at the same time. reply thriftwy 3 hours agorootparentHaving these routes are no problem if you add five times as much pragmatic routes.On almost every city map in the US you can see a railway crossing it, usually in the downtown behind a large mall that should also double as a rail station if you ask me. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentprevI’m not even entire sure that all cost included that long distance Amtrak trains are lower carbon than other options. reply philwelch 5 hours agorootparentprevMost Amtrak locomotives are diesel. reply thriftwy 4 hours agorootparentPut some wires on the top instead of laying CO² pipes. replyGenerWork 12 hours agoprevLooking at that ridership chart, I&#x27;m amazed that they even run lines like the Empire Builder, California Zephyr, Southwest Chief, and Texas Eagle. They must be losing tens of millions of dollars a year on those lines, money which could be spent on upgrading lines like the Northeast Regional and the Pacific Surfliner.Edit: the Vermonter and Ethan Allen express have even less ridership but are shorter, I wonder how much money those lose. reply mikeocool 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a kind of interesting chicken and egg situation.The Northeast Corridor has at least hourly service through out the day, &#x27;high-speed&#x27; (for america) trains, and lots of newish comfortable equipment, it&#x27;s arguably the most civil way to get between NYC&#x2F;DC&#x2F;Boston.A lot of the rest of the lines have once-per-day service, that runs on old equipment along freight lines. If you want to ride the Empire Builder from Fargo to Minneapolis, your only option is to get up at 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning to catch the one train of the day, and if that train had to wait for a freight train (which has priority) along it&#x27;s previous 2 day journey from Seattle, it wouldn&#x27;t be unusual for it be delayed until 3 or 5am.Since the US doesn&#x27;t invest in passenger rail outside the NEC, it becomes less and less viable for anyone to actually use it. reply gradys 11 hours agorootparentThe key feature of the NEC is that the cities are large and close together. This is true almost nowhere else in the country. reply mikeocool 11 hours agorootparentFair, though if we invested in high speed rail a lot more cities would be within 4-5 hours of each other (and have the added advantage that the train would be consistently be faster than driving). reply ARandumGuy 12 hours agoparentprevRidership numbers isn&#x27;t the whole story. For example, the Empire Builder only runs one train per day each direction, which puts a serious limit on the total ridership that&#x27;s even possible.Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve used the Empire Builder for two trips this year, and both times every train was completely booked (on a weekday, no less). There is demand for these trains, which I suspect would be even higher if Amtrak ran faster, more frequent, and more consistently. reply runarberg 12 hours agorootparentThe Empire Builder is actually kind of a weird one. It is both an important interurban between Chicago and Minneapolis (and possible as far as Fargo) as well as between Seattle and Spokane (and Portland and Spokane), but also a very popular tourist route.The fact that it is serving both these purposes is kind of a determent to both. It runs to infrequently (and at weird hours) to serve as a nice interurban, and it gets too overbooked to serve a tourist route. To fix this the state of Washington (and Minnesota) need to operate more frequent interurbans that only services the end portions of the route (like 4 trains a day at least), and then Amtrak could operate the whole Empire builder in a more sane manner. reply Ichthypresbyter 7 hours agoparentprevThose two services are subsidized by state governments- Vermont for both, plus AIUI Connecticut for the Vermonter and New York for the Ethan Allen Express.This also means that there are very cheap fares on those trains within Vermont, and I&#x27;ve sometimes noticed that it&#x27;s actually cheaper to buy a ticket from DC to a station in Vermont than to buy one to New Haven. reply divbzero 14 hours agoprevFor comparison, here is Europe’s rail network with high speed rail (≥200kph) in color and other rail ( European one barely scratches the surface, as it shows three lines in the whole Netherlands, which is not exactly true.Check https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openrailwaymap.org&#x2F; for a complete overview. reply pluto_modadic 11 hours agoprevThe one the conductor I met used is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asm.transitdocs.com&#x2F;, it shows where the train should be (if it updated its position), and delays and such.

Trains will never compete with air travel except maybe in regional service. reply lmm 8 hours agorootparentChina is a similar size but trains are very competitive there.I think the part that&#x27;s missing is good urban transit systems. A long distance train loses most of its advantages if you have to hire a car at the end of it. reply philwelch 5 hours agorootparentChina has about three times the US population and it’s almost entirely concentrated along their coast. Passenger rail makes sense for that kind of population density. Where the US has similar density, it has Acela, which is the profitable part of Amtrak.China also has a massive construction bubble that the government keeps propping up in order to delay the inevitable correction. As a result they overbuild a lot of infrastructure, including passenger rail, well beyond the point of diminishing returns. reply lmm 1 hour agorootparent> China has about three times the US population and it’s almost entirely concentrated along their coast. Passenger rail makes sense for that kind of population density.But they have high speed rail across the sparsely populated interior as well - not as dense as the network on the coast, but it&#x27;s there and it successfully competes with flying. So the sort of network that the west half of China has should be possible in the US.> they overbuild a lot of infrastructure, including passenger rail, well beyond the point of diminishing returns.Maybe. Or maybe they sensibly plan ahead and build infrastructure that will be needed in the near future. Time will tell. reply objektif 7 hours agorootparentprevCompete in terms of what? Spending at least 5 extra hours before and after you travel in order to just get stuffed inside a tube and get treated like sht? reply SoftTalker 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an exaggeration. Airlines will tell you to arrive at the airport 2 hours before your flight but if you&#x27;re a bit organized, check in online, know what you can and can&#x27;t pack in your carry-on, I&#x27;d say 90 minutes is fine. I usually end up sitting at the gate for about an hour waiting for boarding if I arrive 2 hours in advance.Even so, a flight from Chicago to San Francisco is a little over 4 hours in the air. A train takes 2 days. There is no comparison. reply crazygringo 14 hours agoprevThat&#x27;s cool. Definitely never occurred to me that there are whole states in the contiguous-48 without Amtrak at all (South Dakota, Wyoming). And then more that are \"just barely\" (Idaho, Tennessee, Kentucky). reply jcranmer 13 hours agoparentTo be frank, a large portion of the US West is utterly devoid of population. The largest city in SD is ~300k in MSA, and the largest city in WY is ~100k. Trying to make a route to Sioux Falls, SD pretty much means skipping both Minneapolis (3.7M) and Des Moines (700k), while going to Cheyenne, WY means skipping Denver (~3M).The largest cities not served by Amtrak are Phoenix (although it is indirectly served via Maricopa), San Francisco (though indirectly served via Oakland), Las Vegas, Columbus, Tulsa, Honolulu, and oh look we&#x27;re out of 1M+ MSAs. reply AlotOfReading 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s very charitable to describe Phoenix as served by Maricopa station, even indirectly. It&#x27;s 45min&#x2F;30mi away on the other side of a mountain range in the middle of the desert. It&#x27;s not even in the same county. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentThat’s closer than much of LA is to the train stations. reply AlotOfReading 11 hours agorootparentHonestly, no. That&#x27;s the distance from the close parts of the city. The equivalent for LA would be Union station being out in Palmdale. The farther parts of the MSA and traffic can add 1-2hrs to that time.LA is pretty well covered overall though, at least by West Coast standards. The biggest hole in the train network is long beach, but there&#x27;s a lot of transit development happening in that area nowadays. reply jcranmer 9 hours agorootparentprevTechnically, the MSA is served, but unlike SF&#x2F;Oakland MSA via Okland, yeah, Maricopa doesn&#x27;t really service Phoenix at all. reply buildsjets 13 hours agorootparentprevLooking forward to the opening of Amtrak service to Honolulu. reply mayormcmatt 12 hours agoprevThis is really beautiful and I love it on multiple levels.

But that 11hr drive is easily longer due to pit stops and potentially traffic depending on when you hit metro areas.While on the train you can travel in basically first class comfort. Read a book.

The terrain between NYC and Chicago is rugged so no such path to be expected. Maybe the Chinese would be able to build a 1000 km elevated track between those two cities and make it all work, though they will prefer to make it an 5h daytime ride and not a nighttrain... reply benatkin 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t want a night train, I want a day train.The train isn&#x27;t too rugged for them to run 3 trains per day instead of 1, running at different times, so you can choose the time you leave a given station. replyskadamat 14 hours agoprevSuper neat!

It&#x27;s my primary mechanism these days for discovering and acquiring music.I was puzzled when Epic bought Bandcamp, apparently they were too.

Anybody know anything that could shed light on that? reply troyvit 17 hours agoparentThis is interesting! When I saw the Epic news the first worry I had was regarding Bandcamp. Even after I quit trying to get a job there I&#x27;d look at their jobs page all the time to get a sense of their health. It&#x27;s been empty for a few months.One of the suppositions people had about Epic buying Bandcamp was that maybe it would allow Epic to more easily license music for their games. From the press release[1] it seems like they did that. I have no idea how well that worked but here we are with Songtradr, \"a music licensing platform and marketplace company,\" acquiring them.On its own Bandcamp is (was?) a profitable enterprise.[2] I wish they&#x27;d go back to being on their own. That said, if Songtradr does nothing more but give artists more diverse ways to make money off their music I&#x27;m all for it.That said multiple changes of ownership can play hell with continuity and morale.

I too used to look at their hiring page a lot. I think that Bandcamp has so much untapped potential, but it&#x27;s held back by a mediocre site and terrible interface if you own more than 100 albums.They added playlists, I think, this year but I have > 1200 albums on the service (I buy a lot of full discographies and subscriptions when labels have them) and it&#x27;s so painful to try to go back past the first 100 or so.Music discovery is OK through the site - their Bandcamp Daily and other content is great - but it could be so much better. And it&#x27;s screaming for better social features. Sigh. reply politelemon 18 hours agoparentprevI can&#x27;t see it as a good thing at all. They&#x27;re effectively being thrown about to yet another operating model which will have a disruptive impact on them.The new company Songtradr focuses on licensing, it&#x27;s a b2b, while Bandcamp is a b2c. So it can be easy to see how they&#x27;d want to make Bandcamp more like themselves. Of course I&#x27;m being negative and cynical, apologies. I share the same fondness for Bandcamp. reply JAlexoid 17 hours agorootparentI mean... Bandcamp is also licensing, all of works of art \"copy sales\" are just licensing agreements. B2C is just commonly a preset non-commercial license.

Before Bandcamp a store I trusted was Loudr.fm and that was their big deal was that they were a b2b license shop for the rights to things like covering video game music and then were a trustworthy b2c consumer shop for the covers the musicians had an easier time licensing. Ironically as Bandcamp ascended most of their musicians needed&#x2F;wanted Bandcamp presences and they shuttered their b2c shop and encouraged everyone to just move to Bandcamp, refocusing to just the b2b side of the business. The internet tells me that what remained of Loudr.fm was then eventually swallowed by Spotify in 2018, and that interestingly and likely but not necessarily a coincidence 2019 was when Songtradr got serious about expanding, and so it goes. reply Springtime 17 hours agorootparentprevLooking at their Wikipedia they also apparently bought 7digital, another online music store, earlier this year.

Basically all software and gaming got a massive bump that was obviously going to have an unsustainable component to it. But in many cases companies planned like it was totally sustainable and would continue. That’s why even super profitable companies like Microsoft and Epic are doing layoffs in 2023.The other reason of course is that they went a bit crazy with the hiring sprees and accumulated some unproductive devs who are probably a net drag. That’s ultimately a healthy force in the economy as those people can do more in smaller firms with less in-house expertise (albeit at lower wages).I wonder also how much of a driver new programmer productivity tools like copilot and ChatGPT are factoring into this.

There is no recession, just normalization (zero interest rate policy, or ZIRP, was an abnormality). Unemployment is close to lowest levels in history because of structural demographics. When money gets more expensive, you must perform, adapt, or die as a business. Cashflow is king, and profits juiced from government stimulus mentioned is simply evaporating as the Fed drains money out of the system.Businesses are attempting to discover how to operate in a macro that makes labor and money more expensive than they&#x27;ve been accustomed to over the last 15-20 years. u&#x2F;DoughnutHole touches on another important point: businesses and capital are clinging to returns that might no longer be obtainable in this new macro (as we&#x27;ve been papering over reality with cheap credit and financialization for some time).

You require \"Junior\" engineers to have 3+ years of experience, discourage apprenticeships in lieu of short internship stints and headhunting acedemia, and overall try and compartmentalize engineering roles. So no surprise that labor in the Gen Z won&#x27;t be as skilled as the Gen X that rose entire industries from the ground up. It&#x27;s due (but not limited to):- tech being more complex. How many people worked on Google search in 1999? How many work on search alone in 2023, let alone the other 30+ division Google has now.- top talent more and more seeking out their own business ventures. Same questions as above. More startups and more Ycombinators to fund them. People really want to be or to fund \"the next big thing\" in a rate not seen since the Dot Com era.- simply being ubiquitous. You can work in tech without being in a tech company. If you don&#x27;t like the hustle of FAANG or high frequency trading, there are plenty of places who just need to maintain their website outside of tech. This won&#x27;t drive growth as much, but it pays the bills.There&#x27;s many factors behind this, but I will emphasize that people requiring top talent need to invest in them.

But, again, unity has literally never turned a profit in the history of its existence.The same thing is happening across the industry where the end of free money is putting some boondoggles out of business, burning out the waste that has resulted from 2+ decades of unconstrained tech growth in a ZIRP environment. A correction was inevitable and healthy, excessively cheap money has all kinds of noxious effects on an economy.The most prominent is xbox - I don&#x27;t think anyone realized just how bad things have gotten for xbox but the FTC leaks are devastating, they reveal the xbox division has been on the ropes for quite a while. They have been in severe risk of being closed if they can&#x27;t make gamepass numbers perform, and they&#x27;ve massively undershot the scenarios in which (two or three years ago) Phil Spencer said he&#x27;d close the division. It&#x27;s entirely possible that Starfield is the last straw, and if they don&#x27;t see a big bump in gamepass subscribers from it (which doesn&#x27;t seem to have happened) they may spin off the game-studio side and kill xbox, or pivot it into a \"nettop\" that competes more with appletv and switch pro type hardware.It’s also resulted in some businesses making some crazy pricing model changes and other things, out of a real or perceived need to get to profitability. The unity change will kill the business, and things like google business spinning off domain registry (you need to use a third party service to get a complete offering on google cloud?) are pound-foolish decisions that will&#x2F;could have long-term negative consequences.But the tide is going out and we’re seeing who’s swimming naked, as they say. There were a lot of businesses and projects that were only sustainable with 0% interest money, and companies are rightfully asking if this is worth it if they have to pay 7% or 8% interest. And that&#x27;s exactly the type of unproductive work that needs to be burned out of the economy. reply paulmd 12 hours agorootparentthe xbox stuff I wanted to give more explanation and sourcing&#x2F;perspectives without bloating the abovePS5 has won the console war, Series X&#x27;s hardware advantage has been subsumed by upscaling into a meaningless \"runs 840p instead of 720p input res\" thing that doesn&#x27;t sell consoles and Sony has actually organically built studios that pump out exclusive content that does draw in customers. Microsoft has largely failed at building that, and instead tried to buy more studios to make their content exclusive (bethesda, tried to buy nintendo and activision, etc).Microsoft has pretty explicitly pushed all their exclusives to PC as well, meaning Series S and the Gamepass are the only interesting thing they have going. And gamepass simply hasn&#x27;t been doing the necessary numbers - there was a bump in 2020&#x2F;2021 from COVID, when silicon shortages meant Series S was the cheapest and most available route to a diversion during the COVID disruptions, and gamepass gave you this ready library. But 2022 and 2023 have been the great Going-Outside and the numbers have gone down not up.In the meantime Series S is also this albatross around their neck - they have a much lower hardware baseline for game compatibility, and can&#x27;t really push forward to next-gen without losing those subscribers (who are probably not going to \"convert\" again if it requires a $700 purchase or whatever). like it or not they are trapped by series S and gamepass now, and there is no true next-gen console on the radar (unlike sony), only a refresh.Another problem is that all those gamepass subscribers are using the \"$1&#x2F;mo for 5 years\" crazy promo deals too. Which is another perfect example of crazy VC growth-hacking stuff that is being rightfully burned out.the FTC leaks are absolutely devastating and reveal a company that is so on the ropes they&#x27;re looking at closing the xbox division, or pivoting it to nettop style consoles and going after appletv and switch pro (docked) market, perhaps with an upscaling-based ARM console. They are drastically underperforming the scenario in which Phil Spencer said he&#x27;d pull the plug. But it sure as fuck isn&#x27;t going to be running like it currently is, in another 5-10 years, unless they get a whole lot of market traction awfully fast.I do think it&#x27;s entirely possible that Starfield was their last shot - big flagship title from a big flagship studio, and if they didn&#x27;t do the gamepass numbers (and they didn&#x27;t) this is the final straw. MS has very explicitly avoided weighing in on a true next-gen console and maybe they pivot or kill the division off instead. And this leak is so embarrassing and reveals how much things are so on-fire internally, that the leak itself may push them over the edge too, on top of starfield underperforming this month.

But I guess that&#x27;s not surprising, their only real traction was during the XB360&#x2F;PS3 era and every single other time it&#x27;s been a money pit they dump cash into in hopes of being profitable next generation... everyone kinda knew it intellectually but without the scales of losses being broken out separately, it&#x27;s just an abstract point. Now we know: Xbox is losing so much cash they will probably go under shortly.(which is a great reason to prevent them from acquiring more studios, especially when the goal is obviously to take their content exclusive to combat Sony&#x27;s organic exclusives.

You don&#x27;t want THAT, do you?\"When in reality, Microsoft&#x27;s attitude toward the Xbox division has always been more like Citizen Kane. \"Why, yes, we lost $100 million last year, and we&#x27;re on track to lose $150 million this year.

Layoffs are primarily about short-term metrics to drive shareholder expectations. Where those metrics reflect productivity it is generally three or four degrees of separation from any actual productivity data. The thing those metrics are most good at showing are labor cost aggregates versus industry base rates.The biggest reason for layoffs has always been, and likely will always be, the \"C-Suite class\" controlling expectations on labor costs (salaries&#x2F;wages) in an industry. That&#x27;s why they often happen in waves, many companies at once, it&#x27;s a pressure release valve to keep the labor market in \"control\" propagated by the largest shareholders, especially those born and bred into the C-Suites. Those shareholders don&#x27;t actually care how productive a company is, productivity is increasingly orthogonal to profit. They care how profitable a company is, and companies stay the most profitable when (among other things) the labor market is most effectively depressed (and layoffs are a useful depression tactic) and laborers aren&#x27;t comfortable enough to fight for better wages. reply toyg 18 hours agoparentprevMeh, it&#x27;s nothing to do with that, it&#x27;s just a layoff round.Epic went from 2200 employees in 2020 to almost 9000 in 2023.

They read what it hallucinated up, got confused, and were calling me up to explain minutes later. For those who don&#x27;t know Unity, this is something you have to do daily when building new logic into game components and ChatGPT was clueless about it.The limitations of ChatGPT as a programming aid are very very obvious and it has a long way to go before it&#x27;s really useful to seasoned professionals. reply Rapzid 17 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT 4 may be better but CoPilot is terrible at making suggestions on algorithm work.

It&#x27;s can be a nightmare and cost you way more time debugging than it saves typing.Specifically with type-ahead suggestions I believe with typing you are more engaged in thinking about what is correct. With a CoPilot suggestion the tendency is to just skim it to see if it look good.

Why does the UI sometimes just randomly not work? Why is every interaction with it so slow? Why does it get exponentially slower the more Unreal Engine assets you have? Why is that even in the same launcher? Why can&#x27;t I do basic things like open game pages in a new tab? Does anyone at Epic actually use this thing?Most importantly, why did they do the stupidest PR moves imaginable, by \"stealing\" games that were already announced for another platform?This is basic stuff, it doesn&#x27;t take 5 years to figure it out!

When flush with cash the middle managers love to overspend and grow mini empires in the promise that one day the product will be finished, but it never will because the warring empires require it being unfinished to justify their ongoing existence.Things have to get amazingly bad before such empires are dismantled and the product fixed, generally something existential for the company as a whole.The Epic Store almost certainly could not be fixed without simply rebooting with a whole new team with the incentive structure setup to make it work. reply intelVISA 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a damn shame the only way to get a good product is to find a company that is still in hustle mode -- once its revenue&#x2F;moat is secure it all goes to offshore&#x2F;acquihire hell. reply Pulcinella 17 hours agorootparentYeah at a certain point it seems like the bean counters really take over and the easiest way to grow profits is to cut costs... except a certain point there is only so much you can logically cut or optimize. After that you are just cutting the product&#x2F;service&#x2F;business to the bone. You can remove the suspension in a race car to save weight, but it&#x27;s a bad idea.I am reminded of a Steve Jobs quote: \"\"It turns out the same thing can happen in technology companies that get monopolies, like IBM or Xerox. If you were a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or computer. So what? When you have monopoly market share, the company&#x27;s not any more successful. So the people that can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people, and they end up running the companies. And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums, and the companies forget what it means to make great products. The product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies that have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship that&#x27;s required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product.

It uses the Moonlight protocol, so you can use any NVIDIA GameStream client, like I have used Moonlight from f-droid to stream my PC to my Android phone. Clients exist for Windows and Linux too, and a lot of other platforms as well. Sharing the desktop works out of the box, just download the server, run it, very minimal config to set a password, pair it with a client, and then next time, you just need to run the server and connect with the pre-configured client.It works by converting screen or windows&#x27;s content to video. It&#x27;s low latency by design, bandwidth is up to you, and sound also works by default.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LizardByte&#x2F;Sunshinehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;com.limelight&#x2F; reply theelix 15 hours agoparentMoonlight&#x2F;Sunshine developer here, having all of these people praising the work done by us is a wonderful thing. We developers work very hard to make Sunshine faster, smoother and more powerful each day. So thank you! reply antonjs 10 hours agorootparentThanks so much for building it! My non gaming use case is scientific research, processing massive images and 3D renders coming off microscopes. You need high image quality, low latency, and often accelerated graphics, which VNC etc al are maximally bad at, but sunshine&#x2F;moonlight let me run the GUI tools I need on a high performance cluster and access it from my laptop. reply pak9rabid 14 hours agorootparentprevThanks! It&#x27;s definitely cool to be able to use my Raspberry Pi (running Kodi with the Moonshine addon) as a \"dumb terminal\" to stream from my gaming rig from the other side of the house onto my big ass living room TV :). reply SigmundA 12 hours agorootparentprevNO thank you amazing work! I was skeptical until I tried wow, solid and performant from Windows to Mac for hours of gaming. reply fortyyearsafool 16 hours agoparentprevSunshine and Moonlight are as close to magic as I&#x27;ve ever felt for incredibly low-latency streaming. I used it a lot early in the pandemic to play games from my PC in a shared space in my home on a low spec laptop while I was sick with COVID.Later, I tried it while traveling and was shocked at how well it worked over a pretty bad link and a VPN (Wireguard). reply eikenberry 16 hours agoparentprevThese sort of client&#x2F;server game streaming systems are great modern alternatives to something like RDP. They take advantage of hardware accelerated h264 encoding to get fast video&#x2F;audio transmission with fast input mapping.To me these seem like more modern, simpler alternatives to older remote desktop protocols as they are designed around modern hardware and one of the most demanding use cases, gaming. Seems like an easy win to me. RDP does have more features, but they seem mostly for niche&#x2F;side things. reply MenhirMike 15 hours agorootparent> RDP does have more features, but they seem mostly for niche&#x2F;side things.Being able to copy&#x2F;paste (including files!) between the host and client is pretty useful though. reply donmcronald 15 hours agorootparentThis is especially true for Hyper-V VMs without network connectivity. The enhanced session is RDP over a local socket (I think), so copying and pasting files via RDP becomes the best way to move files between your host and VM. reply naikrovek 14 hours agorootparent> session is RDP over a local socket (I think)my understanding is that it&#x27;s done via shared memory, and if that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s very close to, if not actually, an air gap. reply viraptor 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd it&#x27;s just one specific implementation of the RDP channel. You can also share drives and printers, or write your own custom stream virtual channels. reply snapplebobapple 14 hours agorootparentprevThats broken in the sdl freerdp client (which is the one they recommend for wayland since they deprecated wlfreerdp). Its go8ng to be annoying for a while until sdl3 comes out and they code that bavk into the sdl client. reply pdntspa 12 hours agorootparentprev> RDP does have more features, but they seem mostly for niche&#x2F;side things.I have seen people whose entire jobs live inside an RDP connection reply vijucat 8 hours agorootparentWhy, Sir, I have seen people whose entire jobs live inside this box called a \"computer\". Peculiar, to say the least. reply rrdharan 14 hours agorootparentprevEncode to video is how Chrome Remote Desktop works.The SunRay ALP protocol and NoMachine are actually the two best I’ve ever seen but have pretty much fallen by the wayside in modern times sadly. reply npteljes 14 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. To remotely manage or service a computer, RDP is more suited for the purpose. reply eikenberry 13 hours agorootparentTo manage a remote computer I&#x27;d much rather use SSH than any desktop sharing protocol. IMO the CLI over SSH is much better suited to the task. reply pdntspa 12 hours agorootparentUnless you really like PowerShell, you probably don&#x27;t want to be doing this on WindowsAlso setting up a good SSH server on Windows is a pain in the ass reply rcarmo 14 hours agorootparentprevRDP can also do hardware-accelerated encoding: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taoofmac.com&#x2F;space&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;1700 (tl;dr: use xorgxrdp-glamor) reply high_priest 10 hours agoparentprevHow about pushing this stream to an OBS client? I&#x27;ve been looking for a multiple stations to single, local, hub streaming for some time now and other than terrible NDP implementations and RTSP middle man, there seems to be none that can support it all. Meanind low latency, high quality and not filling whole gigabit connection. reply SigmundA 13 hours agoparentprevCurrently using sunshine&#x2F;moonlight to play PC games on my M2 Mac at 4k 60fps and its been very solid cannot tell its remote over gigabit connection at 70 Mbps HVEC from Radeon card. Amazing tech for sure, only way to really game on Mac and can locate PC anywhere in house, right now in garage.Still use RDP for work though its better suited to lower bandwidth higher latency text editing IMO plus copy paste etc. reply fb03 8 hours agoprevHonestly, WSL has got nothing over a VirtualBox VM using a virtio-net network device on it.- Real VM you can snapshot and transfer to another computer running VirtualBox, even on another OS, as VBox supports other operating systems.- With VcXsrv or Xorg on Cygwin, you&#x27;ll get graphical apps just the same, and with the virtio-net network card on the VM (instead of Virtualbox&#x27;s default Intel Pro1000 - my protip :D) you&#x27;ll get enough speed to watch youtube on google chrome -- e.g.: More than sufficient speed for using an IDE like PyCharm etc- With VSCode, you don&#x27;t even need a X server. Just use \"Remote - SSH\" and connect to your VM and keep your local lower input lag - Works just the same as \"Remote - WSL\" as both essentially use the same mechanism - a remote connection to a Linux server.- Services run automatically, as it&#x27;s just a normal Linux install. No need to &#x27;service docker start&#x27; on every WSL run- Doesn&#x27;t hijacks your Virtualization extensions, like with WSL, which need Hyper-V which actually boots your computer with a Hyper-V hypervisor and blocks nested virtualization, meaning, you can&#x27;t use other virtualization technologies properly outside of Hyper-V if you use WSL** Btw, you also get a (small, but non-zero) performance hit on your Windows box by using WSL, even when it is not running, since now Hyper-V is what boots your system as the ring-0 guy. Yes, your Windows install basically becomes a \"VM\" hosted by Hyper-V.Unpopular opinion: WSL is okay for getting work done quick, but there are better solutions with better tradeoffs in how you handle control of your PC&#x27;s hardware if you do a good VirtualBox set up imo. reply chaychoong 6 hours agoparentOne nice thing about WSL: GPU \"passthrough\" (via GPU-PV) is handled out-of-the-box.There are some solutions (such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesstringerparsec&#x2F;Easy-GPU-PV) that makes the process easy if you are using Hyper-V as the hypervisor, but it is not a straightforward task yet. Hopefully that will change in the future! reply nikau 6 hours agoparentprev> Real VM you can snapshot and transfer to another computer running VirtualBox, even on another OS, as VBox supports other operating systemswsl2 is just a disk image also, you can just shutdown wsl and copy the disk image to another machine. reply ahmetsait 18 hours agoprevI recently tried to get remote desktop working on my KDE laptop with xrdp. Spent days trying to get it working properly with all the fixes and workarounds I&#x27;ve found online and yet it didn&#x27;t even come close to how smooth it all works in Windows. In the end, I accepted defeat, depressed about the state of linux desktop even more. reply sho_hn 17 hours agoparentThe good news is: We know and we&#x27;re taking your needs seriously.Much improved RDP support is coming with Plasma 6 in early 2024: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planet.kde.org&#x2F;arjen-hiemstra-2023-08-08-remote-desk...It&#x27;s integrated into the Plasma display server, so no more fiddling with xrdp. reply SrZorro 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s great news. At the beginning of the year, I had to decide between Windows and Kubuntu for our company&#x27;s remote desktop developers. Windows RDP outperformed every Kubuntu option I tested by far. 2023 hasn&#x27;t been the year of the Linux desktop (remote edition) for us. With these news, it seems 2024 might just be the year! reply donmcronald 14 hours agorootparentprev> exposing a KDE Plasma Wayland sessionDoes that mean I&#x27;ll need to start a session locally before I can connect via RDP or will it be like Windows RDP where it starts a session on-demand? reply bmicraft 12 hours agorootparentCurrently it seems to be intended for sharing a physical screen only reply magicalhippo 16 hours agorootparentprevBeen using KDE Neon on a NUC as a second desktop for years and been loving it, but the complete lack of a usable remote desktop solution for it (I&#x27;ve tried them all, they all suck) has meant my main desktop stays on Windows.With how Windows 11 is shaping up the future was looking rather depressing.So this news sounds great, crossing my fingers! reply binkHN 14 hours agorootparentprevLove KDE! Thank you for the excellent work! The release of the abomination known as Windows 11 has really given a lot of people the opportunity to evaluate new, and better, things! reply supertron 17 hours agoparentprevLast time I played with RDP on Linux it really just seemed to be a wrapper around {the equivalent of} a VNC connection - so even when it worked, it was nothing like the streaming experience when RDP&#x27;ing into a Windows machine. Not sure if things have improved since, or FreeRDP does things differently.I had a quick glance through the FreeRDP site but didn&#x27;t spot any immediate clues as to whether this is a true Windows-style optimised&#x2F;streamed RDP implementation or a \"we&#x27;ll send you a constanst stream of compressed bitmap screenshots\" VNC-style...RDP on Windows is one of the few things I really miss from the Windows ecosystem. There is nothing on Mac or Linux that I&#x27;ve seen to date which comes even close to the near-instantanous experience of using a Windows machine over RDP. reply rcarmo 14 hours agorootparentYou need to set sesman.ini to use Xrdp instead of the Xvnc back-end - that is a packaging issue in some distros. With the right gear you can do 60fps without any issues: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taoofmac.com&#x2F;space&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;1700 reply supertron 8 hours agorootparentAha. Very good. Not sure how I missed that at the time. I’ll definitely be giving this a shot.And your excellent blog is already in my RSS reader so I have even less excuse for missing this detail… :) reply Borg3 17 hours agorootparentprevHell yeah. I spent a lot of time on RDP (Working remotly on my work laptop). Its great protocol, and over LAN its very very snappy, you can pretty much stream video via it but it will choke bandwidth like there is no tomorrow ;) (around 80Mbit 640x400@25)Indeed, comparing it to Xserver, its much better. I use quite a lot Xserver on windows too, to render for example remote Firefox. It works pretty well, but not that good compared to RDP. reply supertron 16 hours agorootparentAbout 15 or maybe even 20(?) years ago I could RDP into a Windows server over a crappy mobile phone data connection connected to my laptop on a moving train and get stuff done. It is a phenomenal protocol, when implemented correctly!! reply seabrookmx 17 hours agoparentprevI too have gone down that rabbit hole with xrdp. I compiled a step-by-step guide that worked on an older version of Ubuntu but it broke with later versions and I gave up.I can&#x27;t speak for KDE, but modern versions of gnome+wayland have a built-in RDP server that \"just works\" (Settings, select Sharing, and enable Remote Desktop). It doesn&#x27;t perform quite as well as windows RDP (a bit more lag) but is vastly superior to other options I&#x27;ve tried (VNC, NoMachine).If you just need an RDP _client_ on Linux, Remmina is really solid. reply x3haloed 17 hours agoparentprevNoMachine works great for me :) It’s not perfect, but it’s darn good, and I can consistently use it across all my Mac&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Lin devices. reply BLKNSLVR 12 hours agorootparentNoMachine was the closest to Windows RDP that I could find, and I tried FreeRDP, xpra, x2go, various vnc flavours and forwarding X windows &#x2F; sessions. It was a few years ago that I tested them so alternatives may have improved.NoMachine is still snappy enough for my needs: primarily browser usage.It does need the remote machine to be logged in, however, which can be annoying and is a differentiator from how Windows RDP works. reply Feofferon 1 hour agorootparent> It does need the remote machine to be logged inNoMachine seems the only one (that worked well?) I&#x27;ve tried a few years back that could be used to access remotely a local session and viceversa. Which is my use case. Sadly the local session must be logged in, as you said. The black screen feature sometime would fail and any passer by would then be able to use the machine locally. Also if there was a problem with the connection or you forgot to disconnect remotely there was no way to take over the session locally. Complete dealbreaker for me reply cf100clunk 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nomachine.com&#x2F; reply Octabrain 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve never used xrdp but I&#x27;ve used Remmina (snap and also flatpak) without an issue. In fact and as a confession, it&#x27;s what I use when working from home to connect to my work laptop and be able to work from my Linux desktop. reply metadat 17 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;remmina.org&#x2F;The promise behind this sounds like the holy grail of Remote Access.Is it Linux-only for the clients? Or can you use Mac and&#x2F;or Windows to reach a Remmina server?Edit: looks like it is RDP protocol compatible? If so, WOW, that&#x27;s cool!From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remmina.org&#x2F;authors&#x2F;:> I&#x27;ve been using Remmina now for several years. I love how it&#x27;s integrated into Ubuntu by default and how I can access the multiple platforms I have to support in one application. I mostly use RDP and VNC (Ultra VNC). reply crtasm 17 hours agorootparentRemmina is great but it&#x27;s a client only, no server.I use it for both RDP and VNC to my Windows desktop. The flatpak currently has a bug with audio over RDP so I&#x27;ve gone back to the version in my distro&#x27;s packages. reply metadat 17 hours agorootparentThanks for the clarification! reply jeroenhd 17 hours agorootparentprevRemmina is a client only, and when it works, it works great. Supports all the basic protocols and has a bunch of plugins (including Teamviewer!) for protocols that don&#x27;t come with the program.It used to have some weird bugs on Ubuntu though, making it crash after clicking the wrong buttons for some reason. That seems to have been corrected and now it just works. Make sure to use an up to date version, especially if you&#x27;re on an older LTS machine. reply brunoqc 12 hours agorootparentprevremmina is awesome. it even supports spice reply davkan 14 hours agorootparentprevI work out of a reminna session every day. I rdp into my windows work laptop from my linux desktop and use it all day. Works great. Audio and video passthrough working well enough that i can use my speakers and boom mic for meetings without getting echo.I have i3wm configured to always launch my work rdp session in virtual desktop 10. Switching between work and personal desktops is instantaneous. 10x more convenient than the kvm and thunderbolt dock setups I’ve used before. reply robertlagrant 18 hours agoparentprevI did it on a Gnome desktop recently and had the opposite experience - it was really simple! There was (of course) one issue regarding profiles, but it was very easy to fix and it auto logs in from my saved credentials in the MacOS Remote Desktop client. reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparentSame, with Gnome it worked amazingly well for me. I didn&#x27;t even have to install anything since it&#x27;s built in to Gnome (under Sharing -> Remote Desktop) reply mrj 17 hours agoparentprevTry NoMachine, it&#x27;s been around for a long time and works great on all of my devices reply npteljes 17 hours agoparentprevFor similar reasons, I ended up using x11vnc as server, and Remmina as the client. Granted, it has been a few years since I last needed it, but this was what worked best, and mostly out of the box too. reply breakds 16 hours agoparentprevJust in case anyone uses NixOS, the following simple piece of code just works for me, and I spent no time setting up a new NixOS machine that enables remove desktop with RDP:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nixvital&#x2F;vital-modules&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;modules&#x2F;... reply icelancer 12 hours agoparentprevRDP &#x2F; xRDP &#x2F; Windows -> Linux is a complete shitshow. I forget this about every 14 months, try to get it working, get extremely mad, and just resign myself to using the completely awful VNC protocol. reply isilofi 11 hours agorootparenttry xpra. reply mmcgaha 17 hours agoparentprevProbably about the same level of smooth as getting X Windows working well on Windows. reply seabrookmx 17 hours agorootparentvcxsrv worked pretty well in my experience!It eats your CPU for breakfast, but before VS Code Remote SSH I used to use X forwarding to get a get a Linux VS Code window on my Windows box. reply aruggirello 15 hours agoparentprevYour best bets are (in order): - Remmina - Xpra - Anydesk reply SkyMarshal 17 hours agoparentprevGnome has RDP built in, may be worth a try depending on your distro. reply flashback2199 17 hours agoparentprevAnyDesk is surprisingly good and works on Linux reply salawat 13 hours agoparentprevWhy use xrdp, and not x11 forwarding over ssh -C (compression)?I can reasonably drive firefox over that link whereas anything bitmap based tends to just die. reply u801e 12 hours agorootparentOne advantage of a remote desktop protocol over x11 forwarding is being able to keep the application(s) open and in the same state when you disconnect and connect from another machine or access the host machine.I haven&#x27;t really used xrdp, but I have used xpra and have been able to attach to running instances of applications that I left open on the host machine remotely (much like I can reattach to a screen or tmux session remotely). reply hexo 11 hours agorootparentprevexactly this. i cant get over why people need to reinvent the wheel again and again.i dont get why there isnt SPICE implementation outside of libvirt. because, thats even better. i mean - usb redirection, sound, (possibly even 3d accel)...and suggesting doubt-ware like anydesk or even worse - teamviewer... okay, these last ones make sense in some situations. reply orangepurple 15 hours agoparentprevUse rdesktop if you want an actual functional RDP client on Linux or krdc if you want convenience (GUI) reply Rapzid 16 hours agoprevWSLg(Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI) uses RDP and FreeRDP to work: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;wslgI haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful the experience is better than last time I tried Hyper-V enhanced linux experience. I imagine this use case is getting FreeRDP way more attention.For years I&#x27;ve developed in a Linux VM on a Windows host via VirtualBox. The typing lag on this, particularly in IDEs like VSCode and Rider, finally got to me. So, I moved over to WSL and have to say; the experience is amazing.Edit: I should say that I haven&#x27;t used the WSL GUI functionality yet. Been using VSCode&#x27;s WSL support and it&#x27;s been amazingly seamless so far. I get native Windows VSCode performance while my project and all its plugins are actually running in the Hyper-V backed WSL linux VM. reply fb03 8 hours agoparentVSCode remote also works equally well via \"remote SSH\" to your VirtualBox Setup. I still use the virtualbox setup because I feel it has advantages compared to WSL:- I don&#x27;t need to enable Hyper-V, which hijacks virtualization and disables other softwares (like VirtualBox) from using it. In fact, when you enable WSL&#x2F;Hyper-V, your windows itself boots as a kind-of-VM from a Hyper-V root, so WSL is just an additional VM inside that cage.- Services run normally, since it&#x27;s a normal linux box. No need to \"service docker start\" on every WSL boot.- Easier to image&#x2F;snapshot&#x2F;transfer to another box or even another operating system, as VirtualBox runs in other OSes.And you get the same native VSCode experience. Try it out (VSCode+Remote SSH to Vbox), you&#x27;ll enjoy just the same as VSCode+WSLOne tip that I have is: Set a secondary NIC in your VirtualBox VM to a &#x27;host only network&#x27; and use &#x27;virtio-net&#x27; instead of the default emulated Intel Pro1000 cards. Much better performance since it&#x27;s essentially a virtual device with unbounded speed. With the virtio-net device, even remote X11 becomes a real possibility with windows apps like VcXsrv. I&#x27;m a Pycharm user (and Pycharm unfortunately has meager support for remote, where VSCode shines) and I use it graphically like this -- there&#x27;s still some input lag tho, but it&#x27;s quick enough for me. reply Rapzid 5 hours agorootparentThere are other benefits to me and I&#x27;m not missing anything by moving to WSL.VirtualBox still works if I need to access something off my old VMs, it&#x27;s just dog slow for some reason using Hyper-V on my system.I haven&#x27;t needed to restart docker after booting WSL. Maybe I will, but hasn&#x27;t happened yet.The WSL vm feels much more performant to me. It supports dynamic memory allocation and in the new 2.0 release I believe it can free memory. This is really nice in general but particularly on laptops with less RAM.Resource sharing seems.. Just easier. I like the default drive and network sharing. Both seem to work fast and I don&#x27;t have to do anything with them..I can still run multiple VMs if I need to with Hyper-V.There is a level of integration that is pretty nice. I like typing \"code .\" in the WSL term and having it just launch VSCode in Windows and be connected. The WSLg system seems really nice for any software I might run that doesn&#x27;t support remote hosts.For me, it&#x27;s all upsides and no real downsides to just running WSL. reply billy99k 15 hours agoparentprevI just installed kali on WSL2 with GUI support. It&#x27;s fantastic. Very fast. Much better than Vmware&#x2F;Virtualbox. reply marmaduke 13 hours agoparentprevWSLg works really well, even for OpenGL 3&#x2F;4, CUDA, and when connected via RDP as well. reply tekchip 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;m surprised to find no mention of RustDesk. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rustdesk.com&#x2F; I self host it and it works great everywhere I need it. reply Semaphor 17 hours agoparentJust wanted to mention that I thought their banner was cool, great for non-technical people:> WARNING: YOU MAY BE BEING SCAMMED!> If you are on the phone with someone you DON&#x27;T know AND TRUST who has asked you to install RustDesk, do not install and hang up immediately.> They are likely a scammer trying to steal your money or other private information. reply karrot-kake 18 hours agoparentprevThanks for the suggestion.

It’s the fastest vnc implementation I have seen, and reasonably trouble-free.My main complaint is that the MacOS client hasn’t been updated for hidpi mode, so MacOS applies a gaussian blur to the session window. (Screen Sharing is the built in MacOS VNC client. It supports HiDPI, but the session immediately hangs when I use it.) reply mercwear 15 hours agoprevAnother good, free option is chrome remote desktop: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotedesktop.google.com&#x2F; reply giancarlostoro 19 hours agoprevJust curious, how do all the different alternatives compare. I know VNC iirc uses raw screenshots, and some implementations will do their best to only send the differences over the network. How do others compare in approach? I almost always reach for VNC because I&#x27;m already familiar with it. reply Neil44 18 hours agoparentWindows RDP is a much better experience than basically everything else, it&#x27;s not diffing a big jpeg of the screen like almost everything else does it sends more primitives to do more compositing on the client end. If the latency is low you often can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re remote. You can actually work on it all day rather than just for doing odd bits of tech support. Plus it maps printers, audio etc. reply while_true_ 18 hours agorootparent+1 for Windows RDP. One thing Windows RDP excels at is working over low bandwidth connections. My remote desktop is in a rural area with very poor internet service -- uploads under 1 Mb&#x2F;sec. With Win RDP I set the \"Experience\" to \"56k Modem\" (not joking) and it eliminates eye candy stuff like font smoothing and window animations, which is fine, at least I have a steady connection that works. I&#x27;ve tried other RDP programs and they always say \"connection lost\" due to insufficient bandwidth. reply mook 17 hours agorootparentprevFor VMs, I find RDP to be on par with SPICE (which is more of a qemu&#x2F;libvirt thing). Both have support for device&#x2F;drive mapping, I believe. That&#x27;s both over ssh sessions (I know RDP has encryption, but I&#x27;d rather not trust it). reply MikusR 17 hours agorootparentprevIIRC it hasn&#x27;t worked like that since Windows 10. It&#x27;s more or less h264. As due to Electron, QT, and UWP nothing draws those primitives anymore. reply StillBored 17 hours agorootparentRDP itself in its earliest versions is just a windows GDI async RPC. Which is why its so fantastically fast&#x2F;responsive on windows. And as of last time I mess with this, thats the way it still behaves for things like MS office, and basically anything that is older than a half dozen years or so, because they are still sitting on the win32 GDI.But, yes your right if you have a \"modern\" application that is basically doing all the drawing on the CPU to a generic canvas with custom libraries none of that works, and RDP has to fall back to diffing and compressing. Which is really terrible on any number of fronts.At that point you might as well just use VNC because the perf is going to be roughly the same. reply applied_heat 15 hours agorootparentProgress! reply MikusR 15 hours agorootparentprevThe ui of modern Office is React Native reply thefourthchime 18 hours agoparentprevI wrote a man-in-the-middle recording for RDP way back when. We did recording for both, RDP is much more sophisticated.Besides using a TLS style encryption (VNC at the time had none). RDP tries as hard as possible to not just send bitmaps. It first shares what fonts it wants to use, then a cache of bitmaps from the previous session (for the wallpaper for example). When Windows move it doesn&#x27;t send bitmap updates, it sends window updates and tells the client to paint a rect, then draw fonts, etc..That said, it&#x27;s a bear of a protocol with countless versions and \"speed mode\" hacks that bypass the layered protocol setup, tons of weird features, etc.. reply giancarlostoro 18 hours agorootparentInteresting, is there software that still records RDP sessions? I&#x27;m not sure if Teams uses RDP or what, but I know it lets you record a call, whether there&#x27;s screensharing or not. reply thefourthchime 14 hours agorootparentThis seems to do the same kind of thing. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoSecure&#x2F;pyrdp reply londons_explore 18 hours agoparentprevRDP is a crazy complex protocol, and you have options for pretty much everything.On the graphics side, you can send over draw commands \"draw the letter A here using this font\", or you can send opengl calls, or you can send dumb bitmap updates. You can get the other end of the connection to do compositing (\"blur this buffer and overlay it over that buffer with 50% transparency\").You can also get the remote end of the connection to decode videos - so when you hit play on an MP4 video inside an RDP connection, the actual video decoding gets done on the client not the server. reply q3k 19 hours agoparentprevRFB (the protocol used for VNC) implements at its base level rectangle-based updates which can be used to send over just rectangle-bound differences between frames. It&#x27;s just that some shoddy server implementations send over the entire screen at once without damagerect tracking.There&#x27;s also plenty of extensions, some proprietary some not, which allow for more advanced compression&#x2F;optimization: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RFB_protocol#Encoding_types reply jeroenhd 16 hours agoparentprevWindows has a special rendering mode for applications when RDP is being used to optimise the connection by redrawing as little as possible. It has the ability to dynamically switch between crisp, pixel accurate forward-chunked-GDI-draw-calls mode to a connection speed based compression level of an H.264&#x2F;H.265 stream. There are also a bunch of extensions related to GPU acceleration.If you use RDP on a Windows server with a consumer GPU, you van hack the Nvidia driver to make more NVENC streams available (they&#x27;re capped in software) to run more RDP heads without overhead.RDP also does sound forwarding, local drive forwarding, printer forwarding, and USB device forwarding (up to a point). It also supports a wide range of security features and authentication as security requirements have increased over the years, and has built-in support for bastion hosts&#x2F;gateways.One very interesting feature is the ability to RDP only specific applications rather than the desktop. Cassowary will let you \"use Windows applications\" by using a Windows VM and using RDP to run the applications on Linux as if they were running locally (Cassowary also automatically suspends the VM which is what sets it apart). It&#x27;s a bit like X11 forwarding, except your local files and drives available without extra commands to set up reverse SSHFS mounts.VNC is to RDP what telnet is to HTTP&#x2F;3. The underlying concepts are the same, but the implementations have very different feature sets and advancements. Does VNC even support passwords longer than right characters yet? Last time I checked, VNC servers still truncated your password.Being proprietary, RDP support on Linux is very limited in comparison. RDP clients like Remmina support a surprising amount of features, but on the server side things aren&#x27;t as compatible. For example, connecting to xrdp works great from desktop clients, but the Microsoft client on Android is slow as hell.I&#x27;ve also experienced buggy behaviour on Gnome when FreeRDP tries to render window borders in app mode. Window borders don&#x27;t get drawn right and clicks seem to be shifted by it for some reason.I don&#x27;t blame the FreeRDP&#x2F;xrdp developers for any bugs or problems because RDP is a terribly complex protocol with tons of features, but sadly Linux doesn&#x27;t seem to have an implementation or alternative that compares to Windows and RDP together. reply dfc 10 hours agorootparent> VNC is to RDP what telnet is to HTTP&#x2F;3.

HTTP&#x2F;3 does a boatload more than telnet, but in its core it&#x27;s just sending text back and forth with some optional special tricks.VNC and RDP both solve \"log in to a remote computer\", but RDP does a lot more than just sending images one way and sending HID input the other way. reply philsnow 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve long been a huge fan of Xpra https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Xpra-org&#x2F;xpra , both because of its \"screen for X\" original focus (though now it supports shadowing an existing session).There was NoMachine &#x2F; nx &#x2F; freenx but it always seemed to be a weird animal to me, requiring installation as a separate unix user, at least at the time. reply isilofi 15 hours agoparentprevVNC is dog-slow compared to RDP. RDP is slow compared to xpra. What xpra does is sending a h.264 video stream (some other compression algos are also available). Also, xpra can forward the whole desktop as well as single applications. Far preferable to any kind of RDP server.However, the xpra client is somewhat strange and inconsistent when it comes to CLI&#x2F;UI behaviour. reply jeroenhd 7 hours agorootparentRDP will also send a video stream depending on what&#x27;s happening on screen. It&#x27;ll try to detect the appropriate transfer mechanism as chunked screen updates increase and decrease in frequency, assuming both sides support the necessary protocol versions.Video streams can be a real issue if you&#x27;re working over a slow connection, especially when your application is using small text. RDP will handle remote GUIs much better, as low bitrates tend to make text unreadable.Of course RDP also supports streaming individual applications.Personally, I think RDP is undefeated at what it was designed for: controlling desktop GUI applications. On Linux, that&#x27;s not the case, though, and xpra will provide a very good alternative.However, I find very few good xpra clients outside of Linux distros. For example, when I look for xpra in Google Play, the first three options are Microsoft&#x27;s RDP client, two X11 servers, and RealVNC. F-Droid lists nothing at all. I suppose u could try the HTML5 client but it&#x27;s kind of a bummer. The situation seems to be the exact inverse of RDP: very good Linux server, difficult to use Windows clients on all other platforms. reply xp84 13 hours agoprevIt would be helpful if it was specified prominently anywhere whether this was a client, a server, or both.

Largely because rdesktop which preceded it is GPL licensed. Which focused a lot of commercial development to create an alternative, and hence freeRDP. Which also did a better job of not being as tightly integrated with X11 as rdesktop is&#x2F;was because a lot of the windows GDI API has corresponding X11 functionality, so if the function is an Xored Blit operation, or a hatched pen fill, then rdesktop just offloadeds to X11 and presumably the graphics card rather than being software rendered. reply dang 15 hours agoprevRelated:Use a laptop as a 2nd display on Linux using FreeRDP - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34010970 - Dec 2022 (137 comments)FreeRDP 2.0 – A Remote Desktop Protocol implementation - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22834286 - April 2020 (122 comments) reply tambourine_man 19 hours agoprevIs there a web client that doesn&#x27;t require backend changes?

Someone asked him a snarky question about Chrome, and I loved his reply. He said this was the world Mozilla was fighting for; where people had their choice of standards-compliant browsers. Mozilla did something amazing... it took a problem the average person didn&#x27;t care about or understand (an open, accessible web) and paired it with phenomenal usability. That&#x27;s their zone of genius.I really wish Mozilla would do the same thing for privacy, data and user identity. Right now, Firefox is the only competitive browser not owned by a gigantic corporation. I really wish they&#x27;d spearhead a safe way to bring identity to the browser level, with a focus on keeping people safe and private.They sorta tried with Persona, but it never went anywhere. Password managers are almost impossible to use for the average person, and Mozilla is in a unique position where they aren&#x27;t a b̵i̵l̵l̵i̵o̵n̵ trillion dollar company (or having to raise VC money to build it). They could charge for a (headless?) email server that focuses on privacy, and pair it with an open standard for authenticating in the browser based on (any) email. We could get one-click logins across the web.People still trust Mozilla (despite them doing their best to squander their reputation with releases like this). They could genuinely fix one of the largest problems on the open web, because they&#x27;re one of the few companies without a prohibitive conflict of interest in the space.Or do something else!

So you were left without vpn (think they don&#x27;t support plain wireguard&#x2F;openvpn from CLI, you&#x27;re stuck with a client not available for your officially supported OS...) or had to hack around to install the old version...

If something goes wonky on their instance, or even if some part of the Mastodon is wonky enough that it messes with the UX of their instance, their write-up will almost certainly explain things in clear language, even for a neophyte.Laziness: what would you rate as the easiest and most obvious choice of instance for an American who knows nothing about Mastodon?

There are many interesting portions of Chrome graphics that we omitted from review to keep scope manageable. While our primary focus was WebGPU, we did explore a few attack surfaces shared by other graphics features. We will interleave background information on WebGPU with descriptions of the important bugs we found. We hope this report will give the security community a deeper understanding of the shape of vulnerabilities we may come to expect with the addition of WebGPU, along with a lens into the vulnerabilities we might encounter in the future. The graphics stack has long been an area of interest for Chrome Security. Before we dive into WebGPU internals, consider the diagram below showing a simplified view of the Chrome graphics architecture. Show above: Attackers' perspective of Chrome graphics. The Chrome process model uses sandboxing to create layered security boundaries between untrusted content from the web and protected user data. However, the rapid evolution and high complexity of Chrome's accelerated graphics features coupled with their need to interface directly with drivers in the kernel, as well as their implementation in memory-unsafe languages mean bugs in graphics code are especially useful for bypassing Chrome sandbox boundaries. Furthermore, although Chrome sets the industry standard for rapidly fixing security bugs and quickly shipping updates to users, the presence and exposure of code supported by third parties creates challenges to getting fixes to users rapidly that can lengthen the period when a vulnerability may be viable for exploitation, reducing the cost attackers must bear to sustain a capability. Enter WebGPU WebGPU entered Origin Trial in mid-2022 marking the first time web developers and users got to experience the new features. Coincidentally, the Chrome Offensive Security team decided to look into WebGPU as our first major research target. According to the WebGPU spec, “WebGPU exposes an API for performing operations, such as rendering and computation, on a Graphics Processing Unit”. Unlike WebGL, its predecessor that set out with similar goals, WebGPU isn't an existing native API ported to the Web; WebGPU is a new API designed to surface the functionality of existing graphics APIs like Vulkan, Metal, and Direct3D. In the context of this document we will only be discussing Vulkan as it is ubiquitously reachable on every platform that WebGPU supports either through the GPU rendering pipeline or the software rendering pipeline. WebGPU introduces two unique attack surfaces to Chrome that will come with their own challenges: the WebGPU API Implementation which was added to the GPU process & renderer process; and the WGSL shader compiler added to the GPU process While they are related and shader compilation is accessible via web-exposed APIs, they pose two unique challenges so we will dig into both attack surfaces separately. To give you the big picture first, the diagram below shows the slice of the Chrome graphics stack required for WebGPU. While WebGPU has many pieces and inter-connections, we omitted a great many notable portions of Chrome's graphics attack surface, including WebGL, Skia, Canvas2D, Widevine DRM, and video decoding for the sake of avoiding complexity explosion. Shown above: The full Chrome WebGPU stack. WebGPU API The WebGPU API is exposed via JavaScript which calls into Dawn, the library within Chrome that implements WebGPU. Dawn is separated into two different libraries: Dawn Wire and Dawn Native. Dawn Wire is a client-server implementation of WebGPU. When a WebGPU API call is made from JavaScript the request is serialized in the renderer process using the Dawn Wire Client, the serialized blob is passed to the GPU process using WebGPU extensions to the Chrome GPU Command Buffer (WebGPUDecoderImpl) , and then deserialized in the GPU process by Dawn Wire Server. Dawn Wire Server then calls into Dawn Native which is the “native” implementation of WebGPU that wraps the underlying platform's GPU APIs. This portion of the review focused on the WebGPU API implementation from Blink to Dawn Backends. We also chose to scope our review to Dawn‘s Vulkan Backend because it is reachable on every WebGPU platform and it is the only platform that’s fuzzable with ClusterFuzz since most of the Vulkan Backend code can be exercised without a physical GPU. Shown above: The subset of the Chrome WebGPU stack we focused on during this portion of the review, with out-of-scope portions de-emphasized in white. Finding: Incorrect State Tracking in Dawn Native leads to UAF tl;dr - Systemic Concerns Dawn has a pattern where objects hold a raw pointer to reference counted objects, assuming a reference is held elsewhere. This assumption can easily break with future changes to the code as we've seen in the browser process with Mojo handlers. Dawn should discourage this pattern to reduce use-after-free bugs. Interacting with WebGPU begins with requesting an adapter which is an object wrapping a single instance of WebGPU and then a device which is a logical instantiation of the adapter. const gpuAdapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter(); const gpuDevice = await gpuAdapter.requestDevice(); /* Call WebGPU APIs */ let buffer = gpuDevice.createBuffer(); As shown in the picture below, under the covers, gpuDevice.createBuffer creates an Oilpan managed WebGPU Buffer object in Blink that holds a raw pointer and a reference to a Dawn Wire Client Object. This Dawn Wire Client Object, which lives in the renderer process, holds a reference to a Dawn Wire Server Object, which lives in the GPU process, implicitly incrementing and decrementing the reference count by sending a wgpuCreateObject on construction and wgpuDestroyObject on destruction over IPC to the GPU process. This Dawn Wire Server Object holds a reference to the Dawn Native Object. Finally, the Dawn Native Object holds a raw pointer to the underlying Vulkan Object (or other graphics API platform object on non-Vulkan platforms.) Through this long chain of reference counted objects we hold a pointer to a resource in the Usermode Graphics Driver (UMD) through our Oilpan managed gpuBuffer object in JavaScript. This is a lot of state to track! Interestingly, this means that it's possible to drop references and free objects in the GPU process from an uncompromised renderer by garbage collecting the corresponding WebGPU object in the renderer process. const gpuAdapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter(); const gpuDevice = await gpuAdapter.requestDevice(); let buffer = gpuDevice.createBuffer(); buffer = null; gc(); Under the covers, the destruction of an Oilpan object drops a reference to its Dawn Wire Client object which when destructed sends a wgpuDestroyObject IPC command to the GPU process. Situations can arise where multiple objects within Dawn Native hold references to the same object, so this destruction won't actually free the Dawn Native Buffer. When we began auditing these references we checked for many of the “classic” reference counting implementation issues. For example, sending multiple wgpuDestroyObject commands from a compromised renderer does not allow the compromised renderer to decrement the reference indefinitely. Reference counted objects use 64 bit integers for tracking on all architectures which prevents integer overflow style bugs. However, we did come across instances where raw pointers were being held without taking a reference to the reference counted pointer. What's happening inside WebGPU? WebGPU gives developers an API to queue up operations and then run them in batches using modern graphics APIs. Under the hood, a lot goes on to make this work. The diagram below shows the simplified life cycle of creating and running a compute shader. The Dawn Native GPUCommandBuffer object, created by the step highlighted in Blue, holds a pre-recorded set of commands that can then be executed at an arbitrary time. Herein lies the magic of WebGPU! It's possible to queue up thousands of GPU compute jobs and execute them asynchronously. Note: The WebGPU GPUCommandBuffer is completely unrelated to the Chrome GPU Command Buffer. This is an unfortunate name collision. The GPUCommandBuffer is a WebGPU object and the Chrome GPU Command Buffer is a mechanism for communicating over shared memory with the GPU process. const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder(); // Encode commands for copying buffer to buffer. commandEncoder.copyBufferToBuffer( source_buffer, /* source buffer */ 0, /* source offset */ dest_buffer, /* destination buffer */ 0, /* destination offset */ 10 /* size */ ); // Create a GPUCommandBuffer const gpuCommandBuffer = commandEncoder.finish(); ... // Execute the GPU commands asynchronously device.queue.submit([gpuCommandBuffer, gpuCommandBuffer]); The same interface is used to create compute pipelines. These pipelines facilitate shader execution and create GPUComputePassEncoder objects which hold references to objects - GPUBuffers, GPUTextures, etc - that the GPU compute shaders will be modifying during execution. const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder(); const passEncoder = commandEncoder.beginComputePass(); passEncoder.setPipeline(computePipeline); passEncoder.dispatchWorkgroups(1, 1); passEncoder.end(); const gpuCommand = commandEncoder.finish(); ... // Execute the GPU commands asynchronously device.queue.submit([gpuCommand, gpuCommand]); Under the covers, the GPUCommandBuffer holds references to Dawn Native objects (in the example above the source_buffer and dest_buffer). A lot can happen during execution of a sequence of commands within the GPUCommandBuffer wgpuDispatchWorkGroups is used to execute shaders, wgpuCopyBufferToBuffer is used to copy one GPU buffer‘s content to another, wgpuSetBindGroup can be used to change the bindings that a compute job is executing on - so it’s very important that the objects the GPUCommandBuffer holds references to are not de-allocated until after the execution of the compute pipeline. However, there are areas in Dawn where the code holds raw pointers with the assumption that a reference is already held to an object such as at [1] in the excerpt below. // Used to track operations that are handled after recording. // Currently only tracks semaphores, but may be used to do barrier coalescing in the future. struct CommandRecordingContext { ... // External textures that will be eagerly transitioned just before VkSubmit. // The textures are kept alive by the CommandBuffer so they don't need to be Ref-ed. std::set externalTexturesForEagerTransition; std::set mappableBuffersForEagerTransition; // [1] ... }; The Bug Herein lies a bug, and likely a bug pattern that could cause issues in the future. An assumption was made that raw pointers could not be added to mappableBuffersForEagerTransition outside of GPUCommandBuffer execution. The code also assumes that references would not be dropped within GPUCommandBuffer execution. Within Buffer initialization, there was a branch that called the function ClearBuffer [1] if the size of the buffer being created was unaligned. MaybeError Buffer::Initialize(bool mappedAtCreation) { if (device->IsToggleEnabled(Toggle::LazyClearResourceOnFirstUse) && !mappedAtCreation) { uint32_t paddingBytes = GetAllocatedSize() - GetSize(); if (paddingBytes > 0) { CommandRecordingContext* recordingContext = device->GetPendingRecordingContext(); // [1] ClearBuffer(recordingContext, 0, clearOffset, clearSize); } } } The ClearBuffer call leads to many other state changing effects and function calls. One of those code paths adds a Buffer's raw pointer to mappableBuffersForEagerTransition. This TrackResourceAndGetResourceBarrier call occurs outside of WebGPU GPUCommandBuffer command execution, which is unexpected, so the only other reference to the Dawn Native Buffer is the reference from the renderer process. From here it was possible to drop all other references to the Dawn Native Buffer object in the GPU process held from the renderer process by garbage collecting the WebGPU JavaScript buffer object, leading to a use-after-free the next time mappableBuffersForEagerTransition was iterated. Pointer lifetimes are difficult to get right. Taking a closer look at this vulnerability we see that there are other raw pointers. These appeared to be safe, but they could easily be turned into vulnerabilities by future changes to Dawn. // Used to track operations that are handled after recording. // Currently only tracks semaphores, but may be used to do barrier coalescing in the future. struct CommandRecordingContext { ... // External textures that will be eagerly transitioned just before VkSubmit. // The textures are kept alive by the CommandBuffer so they don't need to be Ref-ed. std::set externalTexturesForEagerTransition; - std::set mappableBuffersForEagerTransition; + std::set> mappableBuffersForEagerTransition; ... }; As the diff above shows, the fix was to add reference counting to accurately track the Buffer life cycle. It appears that this vulnerability was introduced because assumptions were made about Buffer lifetimes based on the earlier comment about GPUTexture lifetimes. This shows us a problem: even when this pattern is used correctly, it may too easily encourage other incorrect uses. It is hard to verify that the raw pointers in externalTexturesForEagerTransition aren't vulnerable in a similar way. It is probably safer to avoid raw pointers altogether when working with Dawn Native Objects. Finding: Unexpected State Change Before Callback leads to UAF tl;dr - Systemic Concerns WebGPU implements callbacks in the GPU process.Similar patterns in Mojo and JavaScript have consistently caused high severity issues in Chrome over the years. We believe a high bar of scrutiny should be applied to changes within existing Dawn callback handlers and for any new callback handlers being added to Dawn. Increasing complexity in this area would likely have a high cost to Chrome Security. WebGPU was built to offload work from the CPU to the GPU. GPU execution is asynchronous, so WebGPU was built to be entirely asynchronous. In the bug above we learned that Dawn GPUCommandBuffer execution can execute GPUComputePipelines. For example, GPUComputePipelines contain shader programs that have no guarantees on when they terminate. // WGSL Script fn main() { loop {} } GPU Drivers implement Fences to signal the completion of GPU work. These Fences are polled on every logical wgpuTick within Dawn. Once the work on the GPU completes, Dawn will execute a callback in the GPU process that will then change state within the GPU process and send any results to the renderer process using Dawn Wire. This creates a point of reentrancy during callback execution in wgpuTick when the pending callbacks are executed. State can change in unexpected ways during callback execution within wgpuTick and state can change in unexpected ways before callback execution. This creates room for bugs similar to the classic Javascript engine callback bugs that we've seen in the browser and renderer processes. Luckily, as of May 2023, there aren't that many asynchronous calls in WebGPU and these callbacks do not introduce unbounded re-entrancy (i.e. it is not possible to call ApiTick within an ApiTick). The Bug The bug we're looking at occurred because of an unexpected state change between callback registration and callback execution. WebGPU registers a callback handler that executes whenever an error is encountered. void Server::SetForwardingDeviceCallbacks(ObjectData* deviceObject) { ... mProcs.deviceSetUncapturedErrorCallback( deviceObject->handle, [](WGPUErrorType type, const char* message, void* userdata) { DeviceInfo* info = static_cast(userdata); info->server->OnUncapturedError(info->self, type, message); }, deviceObject->info.get()); // [1.a] ... } A raw pointer to the WGPUDevice‘s **Object’s** userdata is fetched and passed to the callback [1.a], which later stores the saved pointer into mUncapturedErrorUserdata [1.b]. void DeviceBase::APISetUncapturedErrorCallback(wgpu::ErrorCallback callback, void* userdata) { if (IsLost()) { // [2] return; } FlushCallbackTaskQueue(); mUncapturedErrorCallback = callback; mUncapturedErrorUserdata = userdata; // [1.b] } When a Dawn Wire Server GPUDevice object is freed, mUncapturedErrorCallback is set to null. void Server::ClearDeviceCallbacks(WGPUDevice device) { ... mProcs.deviceSetUncapturedErrorCallback(device, nullptr, nullptr); ... } However if the Device is put into a “Lost” state [2] after 1.a and before 1.b when the ClearDeviceCallbacks is called it will not be nulled out, leading to a dangling pointer. This creates room for an attacker to send a wgpuBufferDestroy command to Dawn Wire Server before the callback is executed. void DeviceBase::APISetUncapturedErrorCallback(wgpu::ErrorCallback callback, void* userdata) { if (IsLost()) { // [2] return; } FlushCallbackTaskQueue(); mUncapturedErrorCallback = callback; mUncapturedErrorUserdata = userdata; // [1.b] } After that the attacker can clear all references to the WGPUDevice, freeing the userdata leading to a dangling pointer. On the next wgpuTick, if an error callback is invoked it will lead to mUncapturedErrorUserdata being dereferenced, causing a use-after-free (UAF). This leads to the proof of concept below that uses the trick we mentioned earlier where Garbage Collected objects created from JavaScript in the renderer process can be used to drop a single reference to a Dawn Wire Server object in the GPU process, opening the door for the use-after-free. async function trigger() { let adapter1 = await self.navigator.gpu.requestAdapter({ forceFallbackAdapter: true }); let device1 = await adapter1.requestDevice(); // Request a second device. let adapter2 = await self.navigator.gpu.requestAdapter({ forceFallbackAdapter: true }); let buffer1 = device1.createBuffer( { mappedAtCreation: false, size: 128, usage: GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM }); // Set Device::mState to State::kDestroyed. device1.destroy(); // Trigger an error by unmapping a buffer on a destroyed device, // which queues up an error callback buffer1.unmap(); // Trigger GC to drop the renderer's reference to device, and free it buffer1 = null; adapter1 = null; device1 = null; try { new ArrayBuffer(31 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024); } catch(e) {} // Flush. Trigger UAF. await adapter2.requestDevice(); } Finding: Multiple vulnerabilities in WebGPU use of GPU Command Buffer Our Concerns - The Short Version The Chrome Command Buffer is prone to input validation issues, has many legacy undocumented footguns, and is difficult to fuzz effectively. Manual auditing is currently the best way to discover bugs in this area of the codebase. Snapshot fuzzing could help solve this problem. Dawn Wire is a serialization/deserialization library. Dawn Wire does not implement IPC mechanisms that can be used to transfer data between processes in Chrome. Instead, within Chrome, Dawn Wire is built on top of the existing Chrome Command Buffer architecture to facilitate inter-process communication between the Renderer and GPU processes. One of the WebGPU-specific GPU Command Buffer IPC handlers receives serialized Dawn Wire data over shared memory and deserializes and executes it using Dawn Wire Server. error::Error WebGPUDecoderImpl::HandleDawnCommands(...) { if (!wire_server_->HandleCommands(shm_commands, size)) { return error::kLostContext; } ... } WebGPU improved on the GLES2CommandBuffer implementation in many ways. For example, the GLES2CommandBuffer has been plagued with time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities that come with working directly on shared memory that can be concurrently modified by a compromised renderer process. In direct response to this bug class, the WebGPU usage of the Chrome GPU Command Buffer and Dawn Wire Server always copy shared memory passed from the renderer process into a static heap-allocated buffer within the deserializer in the GPU process, before calling into Dawn Native. There are still a few other footguns to avoid when building on top of the Chrome GPU Command Buffer abstraction. The vulnerabilities discovered in the WebGPU usage of the Chrome GPU Command Buffer so far are good examples; such as not holding a scoped_ptr reference to a TransferBuffer while holding a raw_ptr to its shared memory and not validating buffer offsets/sizes received from a compromised renderer process. While these vulnerabilities are in WebGPU's implementation within Chrome, they are not unique to WebGPU. The Chrome GPU Command Buffer had similar issues in 2013, and it is notoriously difficult to fuzz effectively, so we will likely introduce similar bugs that reach stable with future abstractions that build on the Chrome GPU Command Buffer. More Bugs and Notes on WebGPU Implementation Complexity WebGPU was the first web-exposed user to back an ArrayBuffer with a raw pointer. This led to some issues. The WebGPU specification states the getMappedRange() method returns an ArrayBuffer. Within Chrome, this ArrayBuffer is backed by shared memory. Concurrent modification of ArrayBuffer backing stores has led to multiple security vulnerabilities. Fortunately, it is not possible to modify the shared memory in the GPU process after the ArrayBuffer is created. However, if that ever becomes possible in the future it will be a security vulnerability. Interestingly, this also means that we have a well-defined way to compromise an uncompromised renderer that is colluding with a compromised GPU process. Google do not control the underlying Vulkan implementation in the various third party Usermode Graphics Driver that Dawn calls into. Usermode Graphics Driver complexity could reach a point where it becomes indefensible. Vulkan, Metal, and D3d are inherently insecure APIs. Dawn has the hefty responsibility of validating user input before calling into these APIs. The current Dawn fuzzers - DawnWireServerFuzzer and DawnLPMFuzzer fuzz the Dawn wire byte stream, and therefore all of the validation and everything the validation is protecting. Dawn will one day be multithreaded, first as a standalone library and then within Chrome. This will increase its complexity. WebGPU Shaders This section focuses on the portions of WebGPU that ingest and process shaders. Refer again to the high level picture below for an illustration of the components of interest in this section. Show above: The subset of the Chrome WebGPU stack we focused on during this portion of the review, with out-of-scope portions de-emphasized in white. There is not much information out there about threats facing Chrome's existing shader compilers for WebGL shaders, or how Chrome currently defends against them. WebGPU introduced a new shader compiler pipeline that is defended in a similar manner. WebGPU moves away from WebGL‘s GLSL shader language entirely and implements WGSL, a re-imagined high level shading language for the web. Tint is Google’s translator for WGSL. Tint compiles WGSL into a platform dependent intermediate language - SPIR-V, HLSL, MSL - that the underlying Usermode Graphics Drivers will further compile. With the addition of WebGPU, Chrome now has two front-end compilers in the GPU process that can compile some high-level language into SPIR-V: the ANGLE Translator for WebGL shaders (not discussed here) and Tint for WebGPU shaders. Interestingly, the SPIR-V emitted by Tint is not the same subset of SPIR-V emitted by the ANGLE Translator. However, both compilers end up passing their emitted SPIR-V to the same underlying Usermode Graphics Drivers for further backend compilation. Integer Overflow in SwiftShader JIT leads to out-of-bounds read/write tl;dr - Systemic Concerns Vulnerabilities in the SwiftShader JIT compiler aren't being fixed in the SwiftShader codebase. Instead they are fixed by translating away code patterns using the higher-level front end compilers like the ANGLE Translator. This has led to bug variants. Furthermore, ANGLE and Tint sanitization happens on a representation of shaders that is distinct from the representation used by SwiftShader and Usermode Graphics Drivers, creating gaps in protection coverage. Finally, Chrome now has two front-end compilers that pass compiled code to SwiftShader for further compilation making this even more precarious. We did dig into SwiftShader's shader execution pipeline. SwiftShader emulates an entire GPU stack - the Vulkan Implementation within the Usermode Graphics Drivers, shader compiler within the Usermode Graphics Drivers, and the GPU hardware these call into - all on the CPU. GPUs make heavy use of parallel shader computation. SwiftShader implemented a SPIR-V JIT compiler to reach near-GPU speeds that compiles to various architectures (x86, x64, arm, arm64). After shader compilation, the JITTed code is executed on multiple threads to emulate a GPU executing shaders. SwiftShader's JIT SwiftShader's JIT compiler is built on the Reactor API which acts as a domain specific language and interface to the underlying JIT compiler. Reactor emits LLVM-like IR which is then ingested by the JIT compiler backend for Reactor, Subzero. The Bug The vulnerability is a classic integer overflow within a SubZero optimization that collates multiple alloca instructions into a single alloca instruction. void Cfg::sortAndCombineAllocas(CfgVector &Allocas,uint32_t CombinedAlignment, InstList &Insts,AllocaBaseVariableType BaseVariableType) { uint32_t CurrentOffset = 0; // [1] for (Inst *Instr : Allocas) { auto *Alloca = llvm::cast(Instr); uint32_t Alignment = std::max(Alloca->getAlignInBytes(), 1u); auto *ConstSize = llvm::dyn_cast(Alloca->getSizeInBytes()); uint32_t Size = Utils::applyAlignment(ConstSize->getValue(), Alignment); CurrentOffset += Size; // [2] } uint32_t TotalSize = Utils::applyAlignment(CurrentOffset, CombinedAlignment); Operand *AllocaSize = Ctx->getConstantInt32(TotalSize); InstAlloca *CombinedAlloca = InstAlloca::create( this, BaseVariable, AllocaSize, CombinedAlignment ); // [3] ... } CurrentOffset is a 32 bit unsigned integer declared at [1]. By supplying a SPIR-V shader that generates enough large alloca nodes, it's possible for the repeated addition at [2] to overflow the 32-bit unsigned integer, leading to an undersized alloca node being generated at [3]. alloca instructions are later lowered to stack allocations for the actual variables in the shader program. Reading and writing into an undersized stack allocation will lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes. SwiftShader JIT Bugs: Reachable from WebGPU and WebGL As we mentioned earlier, both WebGPU and WebGL shaders are compiled to SPIR-V in Vulkan environments. SwiftShader implements the Vulkan Graphics API. We found a bug, but there are many many layers to dig through to figure out if the bug is reachable. The ANGLE Translator will emit an spv::Op::OpVariable SPIR-V instruction whenever it encounters a variable declaration within the WebGL SL it is compiling. Tint will also emit an spv::Op::OpVariable SPIR-V instruction whenever it encounters a variable declaration within the WGSL it is compiling. When the SwiftShader SPIR-V compiler encounters the spv::Op::OpVariable instruction it will generate a Variable IR. Whenever this Variable IR is being converted from Reactor IR into Subzero IR it calls into allocateStackVariable() which emits a SubZero InstAlloca instruction. Value *Nucleus::allocateStackVariable(Type *t, int arraySize) {Ice::Type type = T(t);int typeSize = Ice::typeWidthInBytes(type);int totalSize = typeSize * (arraySize ? arraySize : 1);auto bytes = Ice::ConstantInteger32::create( ::context, Ice::IceType_i32, totalSize);auto address = ::function->makeVariable(T(getPointerType(t)));auto alloca = Ice::InstAlloca::create(::function, address, bytes, typeSize); // [4]::function->getEntryNode()->getInsts().push_front(alloca);return V(address); } allocateStackVariable() generates the SubZero InstAlloca IR instruction that sortAndCombineAllocas incorrectly optimizes. When the assembly emitted by SubZero is executed on the CPU and the undersized allocation is read/written to, it leads to out-of-bounds memory accesses. The Fix Similar to other bugs in shader compilers, this vulnerability is prevented by the front-end compilers and no changes were made to SwiftShader. For those who don‘t follow the bug tracker closely, looking closer at the fix this is a variant of a variant. Integer overflows keep popping up in shader compilers and ValidateTypeSizeLimitations() is being used to further restrict the maximum size of variables within shaders to prevent these vulnerabilities. It’s unclear if this strategy will prevent more variants from popping up in SwiftShader; especially now that WebGPU will also need to make similar fixes in their front-end compiler. Note: When Tint emits an OpVariable it also emits an OpConstantNull SPIR-V instruction. The OpConstantNull instruction causes SwiftShader, and any other SPIR-V compiler, to zero-initialize variables allocations. As noted in the bug, it prevents the bug from triggering in a convenient amount of time on WebGPU. This is an interesting inconsistency between the two front-end compilers. We are also actively investigating if the ANGLE Translator's lack of OpConstantNull leads to infoleaks. The WebGPU team is considering a separate fix for this bug. More Bugs and Notes on Shader Compiler Complexity The front-end shader compilers - ANGLE Translator and Tint - break Chrome's Rule of Two on platforms like Android, where the GPU process is un-sandboxed and parses complex attacker-controlled shaders as input. In addition, backend shader compilers in the Usermode Graphics Drivers have a high complexity, are closed source, and are evolving targets that are continuously adding new optimizations and functionality. WGSL Shader Compilers are more expressive in general than WebGL SL shader compilers. Notably, WGSL supports both dynamic sized arrays and runtime-sized arrays which introduces complexity when handling. There is state tracking within Dawn to ensure that object types don't change between executions of the JIT compiler. However as complexity increases in both Dawn and Tint this could become harder to manage and lead to bugs. We are currently fixing bugs in SwiftShader by making fixes in the front-end compilers. This is likely a risky way to fix these vulnerabilities and leads to situations where variants can easily slip through the cracks. We believe that Chrome owning the entire front-end compilation component in Tint is a net-positive win for security. The less attack surface we pass on to the Usermode Graphics Drivers the better. We did not spend time digging into speculative execution vulnerabilities. However, we would be surprised if there are no Spectre gadgets in SwiftShader. SwiftShader unifies the GPU process attack surface, and enables exploits that are reachable through the Vulkan API on all platforms. We encouraged the WebGPU team to consider shipping the forceFallbackAdapter adapter option behind a runtime flag. We have not yet audited what any of this means at the Kernel level. We don't know what shader compiler execution looks like on a GPU and what the shape of a vulnerability in that area would look like. Summary of Findings WebGPU introduces a significant amount of attack surface to Chrome's GPU process both through the core WebGPU implementation which lives in Dawn, the WebGPU extensions to the GPU Command Buffer, and transitively through the third party Usermode Graphics Drivers and everything below. The vulnerabilities in the document are meant to showcase attack surfaces and patterns that demonstrate further complexity will likely lead to more vulnerabilities. WebGPU invested a significant amount of effort on validating renderer supplied input before calling into drivers and reference counting pointers. This investment paid off – we found precisely zero “low-hanging” vulnerabilities in Dawn. WebGPU also introduces a large amount of attack surface through the compilation and execution of shader compilers in Chrome's privileged GPU process in Tint, third party Usermode Graphics Drivers, and SwiftShader. WebGPU has invested a significant amount of effort on fuzzing Tint. However the fuzzing only targets the parsers and lexers within Tint and doesn‘t exercise the code in SwiftShader or on Usermode Graphics Drivers. There is room for Chrome to invest in fuzzing shader compilers with syntactically and semantically correct code in the same way that we fuzz V8 with Fuzzilli to exercise code in **SwiftShader’s** JIT compiler. Like V8, shader compilers will have bugs that are unfuzzable. Chrome Security will need to continue manually auditing shader compiler implementations to correctly assess risk and reduce bug density. Furthermore, where we lack access to source code, such as third party Usermode Graphics Drivers, expanding fuzzing support is our only feasibly scalable approach to mitigating the risk of third party code within the Chrome GPU process. Systemic Concerns We found many one-off vulnerabilities in WebGPU during this exercise, and we found some bugs that hinted at future problem areas: Dawn use-after-frees: Dawn has a pattern where objects hold a raw pointer to reference counted objects, assuming a reference is held elsewhere. This assumption can easily break with future changes to the code as we've seen in the browser process with Mojo handlers. Dawn should discourage this pattern to reduce use-after-free bugs. Dawn Callbacks: WebGPU implements callbacks in the GPU process. Similar patterns in Mojo and JavaScript have consistently caused high severity issues in Chrome over the years. We believe a high bar of scrutiny should be applied to changes within existing WebGPU callback handlers and for any new callback handlers being added to Dawn. Increasing complexity in this area would likely have a high cost to Chrome Security. Chrome Command Buffer: The Chrome Command Buffer is prone to input validation issues, has many undocumented legacy footguns, and is difficult to fuzz effectively because feature coverage requires (a) a harness that supports Chrome in multi-process mode, (b) a stateful generator that can leverage context across test cases, and (c) can sometimes also require execution on a host with a physical GPU. Snapshot fuzzing may be useful to address some of these challenges, although manual auditing is currently the best way to discover bugs in this area of the codebase. SwiftShader JIT: Vulnerabilities in the SwiftShader JIT compiler aren't being fixed in the SwiftShader codebase. Instead they are fixed by translating away code patterns using the higher-level front end compilers like the ANGLE Translator. This has led to bug variants. Furthermore, ANGLE and Tint sanitization happens on a representation of shaders that is distinct from the representation used by SwiftShader and Usermode Graphics Drivers, creating gaps in protection coverage. Finally, Chrome now has two front-end compilers that pass compiled code to SwiftShader for further compilation making this strategy more precarious.

I am wondering how many of these issues would go away by using Rust or at least minimized to easier to audit unsafe blocks. Obviously it might take them 10x the effort to write the code on Rust and to integrate that into Chrome, but the security effort shown here has a large cost as well. reply wffurr 18 hours agoparentAlready happening but the timeline is too late for Dawn (the Chrome WebGPU implementation): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.googleblog.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;supporting-use-of-ru... reply bionhoward 22 hours agoparentprevSeems like the first two issues would be harder to encounter in rust (raw pointers and double mutable borrows) but rewriting a huge project is a bad idea because of the massive amount of work involved.The maintainers could make a crate for some tiny crucial vulnerable subsystem and call it from c++, that might be more reasonable baby step and get them rolling with rust inside chrome (as opposed to chrome inside rust which would possibly take forever, some dork can crank a little rust program in a weekend)Also automatic rewriting the whole codebase could work but that’s just a research direction at this point even for google as far as I know, and chrome probably isn’t the kind of thing you just auto-rewrite and it works right away (maybe I’m pessimistic) reply pjmlp 21 hours agorootparentInitially the Chrome team was the opinion that adding Rust to Chrome would be a too big effort and thus focusing on better practices for C++ would be a better approach, hence Olipan, the C++ GC now introduced in V8.Eventually about an year later they changed their mind, and are now allowing Rust for new code in Chrome, in a kind of baby steps.Most likely, because as the report shows, no matter how carefully the code is written and reviewed, there are security flaws due to memory corruption sneaking in. reply nicoburns 22 hours agorootparentprevThere is at least already a WebGPU implementation in Rust (the one that Firefox uses). So they could use that if they wanted to. I guess it&#x27;s probably better for the overall health of the ecosystem if there are multiple implementations though. reply tormeh 21 hours agorootparentYup, wgpu is already a thing. While it&#x27;s ironically widely used on desktop, it&#x27;s less mature in the browser context. Like, there is an open-world 3D MMORPG using wgpu for its graphics, meanwhile it&#x27;s not yet enabled on stable Firefox.I&#x27;m not sure whether many different implementations is inherently good, though. reply cormacrelf 21 hours agorootparentYou can say the same thing about something as simple as \"shared memory\" -- normal multiprocessing computers have had shared memory since time immemorial, but browsers literally disabled SharedArrayBuffer from 2018 to 2020 and anyone using them to communicate with Web Workers had to find another way. Browsers run a 24&#x2F;7 onslaught of extremely untrustworthy code, whereas games only run themselves.Firefox has not enabled WebGPU via wgpu for the same reasons Chrome Security has done an in-depth review of Dawn. It is a component that must be hardened. For anyone out there trying it out by enabling config flags, remember to disable it once you are done.

I was describing why the Firefox team might wait for a feature to be security-hardened before releasing it. The answer remains the same -- they design and market the thing to be secure even when it executes untrusted code. Activision does not advertise their games as able to \"securely execute RCE gadgets from maliciously crafted steam authentication packets\". This part may be surprising: the Chrome and Firefox teams do, in fact, try to ensure that when someone gains RCE, that they execute it securely and it can&#x27;t get very far.I am not attempting to claim that games do not have security issues or cannot experience remote code execution, just that this is not a normal pattern of behaviour that they plan for, so it is normal that a game author would deploy wgpu long before Firefox does (while Firefox spends a lot of effort on fuzzing, etc). If anything a terrible CVE that Activision has expended apparently zero resources fixing is a very good example of what I&#x27;m talking about. reply Buttons840 12 hours agorootparentUnderstood.

That is not possible to express in Rust (without unsafe).Some other issues are definitely going to be trickier - for example, passing a raw pointer to another context and then crashing that context while it&#x27;s still held. This has come up within Rust before - how do you handle `&str` backed my mmap when another process could write to those values.And then some are... maybes. Integer underflow panics in tests but not in release - when mixing it with something inherently unsafe like alloca, would Rust have helped? IDK. Certainly I think integer overflows are less likely to make it to release in Rust thanks to the default behavior, but it&#x27;s also absolutely an area where I expect Rust to do only a bit better than other languages. reply Rusky 15 hours agorootparentprevCross-process shared memory doesn&#x27;t really make a difference here. Rust&#x27;s support for multithreading works the same way regardless, there&#x27;s no expressivity problem. reply insanitybit 15 hours agorootparentx-process shared memory is definitely a problem. This has come up before - ex: is it safe to hold a &str into an mmap&#x27;d page? Another process could modify the data such that it is no longer valid utf8, even though you held a reference to it.This is just out of scope for the borrow checker. Instead you&#x27;ll have to roll your own abstraction that tries to maintain its own invariants, such as a &MmapStr that doesn&#x27;t perform any `unsafe` operations that assume utf8&#x2F; immutability. reply Rusky 7 hours agorootparentYou can cause the same problems from another thread in the same process, or even from the same thread. The fact that an OS process boundary is involved isn&#x27;t relevant- you simply don&#x27;t form the &str if some other part of the system has that kind of access to it, whether or not the OS is involved.The point of Rust&#x27;s type system here is that it makes that distinction at all, not that the one side of that distinction has additional invariants. reply alexvitkov 19 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re overthinking it.

    "originBody": "PUBLISHERS AND SCHOLARS, UNITE! a magazine of ideas, arts, and scholarship ESSAYS INTERVIEWS SECTIONS SERIES PODCASTS DONATE PUBLISHERS AND SCHOLARS, UNITE! 9.28.2023 HIGHER EDUCATION BY REBECCA COLESWORTHY A t the university press where I work as an acquisitions editor, my email inbox is a reminder of how much authors care about their books—and with good reason. Scholarly books are the culmination of years of intensive research, writing, and revision, often with major personal and professional stakes. They are labors of love and many other feelings, too: excitement, anxiety, frustration. Many are written in hopes of getting a full-time faculty position, tenure and therefore long-term job security, or promotion. But that’s not always the case or the result, especially given the brutal adjunctification of the academic workforce. I wrote my own university press monograph while working full-time outside academia and hoping—for a while at least—to get a tenure-track job. That was before I started working at a university press and gained a far fuller appreciation of just how much publishers care, too. One of my coworkers in the production department once described her job to me as helping authors’ dreams come true. As publishers, we help authors do what they love. But university press publishing is just as vocationalized as the rest of higher education. University presses are not-for-profit and mission-driven, aligned in our commitment to the advancement of knowledge. Yet we vary significantly: in parent institutions and locations within the university; in budgets and business models; in size, staffing, and subject areas; in the types and formats of our publications. Although more people happen into university press work than some scholars might imagine, we, too, are prone to loving what we do. Like authors, we care about the fields we help to shape, the books we help to create, and the scholarly communities of which we are a part. We also care about doing our jobs well and about having good jobs in a sector where they are increasingly hard to come by, at least for the rank and file. As fellow workers in and around higher education, university press publishers and scholars occupy the same economy, with the cares, commitments, challenges, and changes on one side mirrored on the other. I use this term economy quite intentionally. More often than not, scholarly publishing gets described as an “ecosystem.” I worry that in “naturalizing” our operations, environmental metaphors conceal more than they reveal about what we do and the conditions in which we do it. Scholars and publishers have our own unique areas of expertise, responsibilities, and experiences of the manifold crises into which higher education is perpetually forced. But at base, scholars’ working conditions are publishers’ working conditions. If we want to change these conditions, we have to begin by recognizing—and working together to find—our common ground. Manufactured austerity; corporatization; competition over supposedly scarce resources; attrition and downsizing; mass PhD production; adjunctification; shrinking enrollments; escalating expectations to publish or perish; and, of course, the ongoing devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the right’s war against academic freedom: these issues affect us all. The last few years have seen heartening acts of solidarity with university press publishers. In 2019, Stanford University threatened to cut the Press’s funding; in response, faculty, authors, and publishers rallied to express their outrage and save SUP. In 2021, staff at Duke University Press and then, a few months later, Oxford University Press announced their plans to unionize; in response, authors signed petitions of support and voiced their encouragement on social media. These campaigns spotlighted challenges faced by individual presses, but also shared struggles across university units. “Constant turnover, extended vacancies, disruptive reorganizations, lack of professional growth opportunities, patterns of discrimination, inconsistent enforcement of policies, and compensation that is not commensurate with our quality of work and years of experience as professionals”: these were some of the issues driving the formation of the DUP Workers Union, according to their website. I expect they resonate with the experiences of a wide swath of readers, at other university presses, in higher education more broadly, and far beyond. The surge in labor organizing and action among culture workers across higher education, publishing, museums, and writers’ rooms—a movement of which university presses have been part—is a testament to just how common these issues are. Still, I’m not sure how many readers would readily imagine them to be issues for workers at university presses. Think, for example, about how university press publishing is often perceived and even touted as a broadly viable “alt-ac” career path for humanities PhDs. Such a path is possible. I’m proof of that. But it’s also the case that I worked in other roles for eight years after getting my PhD before I happened to land in a city with a university press that eventually happened to have an opening for an acquisitions editor. Mine isn’t a readily replicable path. Since becoming an editor, I have had conversations with tenured faculty members and graduate students who were surprised to learn that my starting salary as an acquisitions editor was $47,500. They just assumed an editor would make more, perhaps especially one with a PhD. Yet, like full-time faculty salaries, university press staff salaries can vary significantly based on the institution, the region, and other factors. And, like faculty, university press workers often need to get competing offers or make big cross-country moves in order to advance professionally. It can be tempting to assume the proverbial grass is greener on the other side—except presses aren’t really on the other side, if there is one. Scholars and publishers are in this together. BROWSE READING AFTER THE UNIVERSITY BY SARAH BROUILLETTE For decades now, it has been clear that university presses are subject to the same institutional disinvestment as both humanities departments and libraries. Some 20 years ago, in May 2002, the president of the Modern Language Association (MLA) sent a “special letter” to the organization’s members about precisely this issue. The letter was intended to alert them to “a serious problem in the publishing of scholarly books.” The problem was that universities were cutting back on both their library and their press budgets. For libraries, this loss of funding coincided with increased subscription costs for science journals from for-profit publishers, leaving even less money to purchase books. With both the library market for books and institutional funding in decline, university presses were, according to the letter, “cutting back on the publication of works in some areas of language and literature.” Some presses had even “eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines.” This second concern is strictly anecdotal: “we are told that certain presses have eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines” (emphasis added). Whether the rumors were true, I’m genuinely not sure.1 Either way, the letter is primarily focused on what these cutbacks and changes mean for tenure-track faculty. Junior faculty, we are told, find themselves in a “maddening double bind.” They are expected to publish a monograph with a “reputable press” to get tenure but may not be able to for reasons beyond their control. “We are concerned,” the letter goes on, “because people who have spent years of professional training—our students, our colleagues—are at risk. Their careers are in jeopardy, and higher education stands to lose, or at least severely to damage, a generation of young scholars.” Encountering the letter now—as a university press editor, the author of a university press book in literary studies, and a PhD in English who did not get a tenure-track job—I can’t help but see its omissions. I read mention of editorial jobs being eliminated and wonder, were there people in them? Were they laid off? If so, what “severe damage” had been done to their careers? Or, as was already happening in humanities departments and as I’ve seen happen in publishing, were people retiring or leaving, never to be replaced? UNIVERSITY PRESSES ARE NOT IN CRISIS. ARGUABLY, HOWEVER, WE ARE PART OF THE SAME CRISIS OF WORK IN WHICH SCHOLARS ARE EMBROILED. And what of scholars who had not ended up in tenure-track jobs? By the time the letter was sent, casualization had already laid siege to the professional ambitions of at least one generation of young scholars. Between 1975 and 1995, the percentage of part-time faculty in the academic workforce increased from 24 percent to 33 percent, while the percentage of tenure-track and tenured faculty dropped from 45 percent to 34 percent.2 What of the careers of adjunct faculty and those of their peers driven out of academia altogether? Such questions simply are not within the purview of the letter. For this reason, it inevitably reads to me now as a missed opportunity to build greater solidarity among scholars, publishers, and librarians. At the same time, the letter was just part of, and helped to set in motion, a series of earnest efforts and candid conversations across academic units and institutions, especially about so-called tenure books and the sustainability and even desirability of requiring specialized monographs for tenure. Crucially, these conversations included publishers, which, odd though it may sound, is not always the case. Jennifer Crewe, then the editorial director and now associate provost and director of Columbia University Press, published an essay on scholarly publishing in MLA’s Profession making the case for “Why Our Business Is Your Business Too.”3 Nearly two decades later, her case still stands. The business of publishers should be the business of scholars, too. The first step is talking frankly about the fact that, for better or for worse, university press publishing is a business. There can be a tendency to think of scholarship and commerce as strictly opposed—to think of the lofty world of ideas as floating free of material concerns and mercenary interests. I myself lean on this assumption. I will often, for example, insist on distinguishing between not-for-profit university presses and for-profit publishers such as Elsevier. The distinction is crucial, though, as Derek Krissoff, longtime university press worker and publishing consultant, has pointed out, critiques of academic publishers tend to conflate the two. I routinely see academic publishers in general disparaged as an untrustworthy means to an end or, worse, as ruthless exploiters of scholars and their work for our own supposed financial gain. Be assured, we are not. But imagining that university presses primarily trade in ideas, not money, means fundamentally misunderstanding what scholarly books are and obscuring the breadth of the labor that goes into making them. Consider, for example, one of the recommendations made by the MLA’s Ad Hoc Committee on the Future of Scholarly Publishing in their final report, issued shortly after the president’s special letter. The committee “urge[s] university presses to resist pressures to commercialize their operations and to ensure that they maintain their mission to publish scholarly work.” On the one hand, commercializing our operations—turning a profit on books, which are, as we’ll see, a major investment—is easier said than done. On the other hand, the money to make books has to come from somewhere. And the primary source from which the money to make books comes, for university presses, is selling books. BROWSE PUBLIC THINKER: RUHA BENJAMIN ON UPROOTING OPPRESSION AND... BY MATTHEW CLAIR University presses are, by definition, driven by mission, not by money. But we also need our books to make money in order to cover our costs and support our operations. So what does it cost to publish a typical university press monograph? In her 2006 essay, Crewe estimates that it costs a university press about $25,000 to $30,000. More recently, in 2016, Ithaka S&R published a study of the costs of publishing 382 monographs across 20 university presses. The costs varied significantly and were broken down into four categories based on the presses’ annual revenue. The average monograph cost ranged from $30,091 for presses in Group 1 (annual revenue under $1.5 million) to $49,155 for presses in Group 4 (revenue over $6 million). The lowest cost for all four groups was $15,140 (from Group 3, presses with $3–$6 million revenue).4 The range itself—among both publishing costs and press budgets—is striking and bears underscoring lest readers assume university presses are a monolith. In reality, we are as varied as higher education itself. Still, for all presses, a monograph is a major investment. Before the book even goes to the printer, the publisher is out many thousands, if not many tens of thousands, of dollars, some of which may never be recovered in sales. Many monographs do not earn back as much as they cost to produce. The largest cost for all the university presses was staff time, “specifically the time related to activities of acquisitions, the area most closely tied to the character and reputation of the press.” Acquisitions staff are often the public face of a press. We also typically have numeric goals; I have a certain number of books I am supposed to sign, get approved by the editorial board, and transmit to production each year. Sometimes editors’ goals are explicitly tied to revenue and their books are expected to bring in a certain amount. I can tell you firsthand that one of the primary activities of acquisitions is communication. Acquisitions work can be curatorial, but it’s also profoundly interpersonal and collaborative. Above all, editorial staff communicate with past, present, and potential authors about everything from the details of a contract to how to respond to reader reports to what permissions they need when preparing their project for production and more. We also engage and work with a vast network of scholars to help to bring in, vet, and, most importantly, strengthen manuscripts—including peer reviewers, series editors, and editorial board members. This labor by others generally falls in the amorphous, expansive category of professional service. Service activities such as peer review have been characterized by John Warner, in Slate, as a kind of gift, though not a “free” or purely generous one. Peer review is a task traditionally performed by faculty with the implicit expectation that it will eventually be remunerated in the form of tenure and promotion. Or, if you have “crossed that threshold” and have a steady salary and job security, “it then becomes natural to do the unremunerated work that keeps the wheels turning for those coming behind you.” Having benefited from others’ professional service, you pay it forward. But this gift economy has broken down. There are fewer tenure-track faculty to support this kind of “free” or minimally paid work; those who are in tenure-track positions are overburdened by other, ever-mounting institutional responsibilities. Meanwhile, the shortage of tenure-track jobs means that publication expectations for early career scholars have skyrocketed. UNIVERSITY PRESSES MAY BE GROUNDED IN IDEAS—AND IDEALS—THAT CAN NEVER TRULY BE MEASURED, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ARE BUSINESSES. Warner’s characterization of humanities scholarship as a gift economy, albeit a defunct one, sheds important light on the “social life” of scholarly books. The 1986 volume The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective, edited by the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai, looks at the various social and cultural processes by which things accrue value and the ways things give value to social relations.5 Appadurai reminds us that even noncapitalist societies have “calculative, impersonal and self-aggrandizing features,” while “capitalist societies, too, operate according to cultural designs.” All things, in both types of societies, have “commodity potential,” the potential for exchangeability, which may be realized “at different points in their social lives,” from production to distribution and exchange to consumption. Even if they are not big moneymakers, scholarly books have always borne this commodity potential. They have always been both economic and intellectual entities, products of multiple people’s labor that are destined for sale as well as contributions to a collective reserve of knowledge. University presses may be grounded in ideas—and ideals—that can never truly be measured, but at the end of the day, we are businesses. Our work has always been part of an economy in which some surplus has helped subsidize our costs. This surplus may be an institutional budget allocation, a drawdown from an endowment, the extra revenue from some bestsellers, another revenue stream such as journal subscriptions, subventions from authors and other grants, undercompensated labor both in and out of house, or some combination of the above. Moreover, we have long sold to multiple markets, of which the university library market is just one. According to one calculation, libraries accounted for about 70 percent of university press book sales in the late 1970s. In the years following the 2008–9 financial crisis, that figure was down to 20 or 25 percent. Paradoxically, the boom in library sales—that halcyon past when presses used to sell many hundreds of copies of a given title to university libraries instead of the current maybe one hundred—seems to have enabled the illusion that university presses somehow operate “outside” the flows of commerce. In other words, when making substantial money from universities, we were most able to pretend that university presses, like universities, were not in the business of making money. Arguably, one of the best measures of university presses’ commercialization—or, to use the term more common in critiques of higher education, our neoliberalization—is our working conditions. If, as the Ithaka report states, staff time is the primary cost of publishing a scholarly book, that suggests it’s also an area where presses can and have cut costs. Understaffing and gigification affect university presses, too. As roles have been eliminated and consolidated and job functions outsourced, university presses have helped to create—and come to depend on—ever-growing pools of freelancers, including developmental editors, copyeditors, typesetters, cover designers, and indexers. Some of these workers freelance on top of full-time jobs at other university presses. Some are scholars who also teach at universities. Many have advanced humanities degrees. We publishers have a hand, I think, in obscuring our working conditions, not least because we are a business that runs on others’—especially authors’—confidence and trust. We need to be professional—but at what and whose cost? For both scholars and publishers, being professional can mean treating our work as a gift, a calling, with commerce happening elsewhere. In our era of mass deprofessionalization—when the humanities especially must do more and more with less and less, expertise is increasingly severed from secure employment, and prestige is inconvertible to income for all but a fortunate few—we must take the risk of being unprofessional. For publishers, this means, at the very least, pulling back the curtain on our business as a business. The economy of university presses, like that of higher education more broadly, has always been hybrid. This is why I’ve argued here against seeing commerce as an external threat that we must resist. Not because commercialization is good, but because it has already happened. University press publishing is commercialized insofar as it is part of a much larger history of overwork, wage stagnation, credential creep—in short, of capital. BROWSE MORRISON AND DAVIS: RADICALIZING AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY MELINA MOE If publishers don’t publicize the conditions and, yes, at times, the commercial aspirations of our work, we risk further contributing to our own devaluation. University presses are not in crisis. Arguably, however, we are part of the same crisis of work in which scholars are embroiled. As my fellow editor Jenny Tan has put it, “the same system exploits our labor as it does yours.” This isn’t just a call for more open communication between scholars and publishers to make all our work go more smoothly. It’s a call for more candor and camaraderie across the board, for mutual demystification infused with the militancy of the growing higher education labor movement. Scholars, publishers, and librarians have to build trust and solidarity, working together to determine the scholarly future we want to work toward. If we don’t, then higher education—as a whole—will lose. A report issued around the same time by an MLA Ad Hoc Committee on the Future of Scholarly Publishing makes no mention of editorial positions being cut. It does, however, further specify areas in which books were not being published: “The suggestion that scholarly presses are publishing fewer specialized studies appears to be true only in the foreign language fields”—a concern to be sure! Still, it’s not clear whether some presses shifting their publishing programs has meant books not getting published at all. “Trends in the Academic Labor Force, 1975–2015,” compiled by the American Association of University Professors Research Office, March 2017.

Since universities pay through their nose for journal and publisher subscriptions, they don&#x27;t have money to actually publish books themselves. Is that right? reply ahi 16 hours agoparentYes, and it&#x27;s a death spiral since the university presses could, in theory, provide some competition. Can&#x27;t&#x2F;Won&#x27;t invest in alternatives => lower competition for the parasites => higher subscription costs => less resources to invest in alternatives.Academic libraries and publishing are effectively being privatized and will be dominated by ever more rent-seeking.

If smaller presses don&#x27;t go out of business, due to the advantage of newer facilities, they are subsidized or bought out by bigger players. reply AnimalMuppet 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think the major universities - the ones that could have publishing houses that matter - are too broke to be able to keep the publishing house running. reply ahi 9 hours agorootparentYou would be surprised. University of Michigan Publishing, one of the largest and wealthiest of the publics only has a staff of ~30, some of whom are shared with other departments. The university&#x27;s annual contribution is well under $2 million. The entire University Library, the second largest research library in the U.S. after Harvard, has an annual budget of $64m (0.58% of the entire budget).I think historically the larger presses were expected to be close to revenue neutral. They do well enough to limp along, but don&#x27;t get the resources really needed to build new infra. As a cost center without significant tuition or grant funding, the library has little pull when provosts form their priorities. reply avar 4 hours agorootparentTalking about \"the budget\" is meaningless in this context, you could similarly argue that Bill Gates can&#x27;t afford to buy his kids bubblegum on any given day.

Journal subscriptions come out of the libraries&#x27; budgets. I am a production editor at a uni press, and our budget is a separate item that is not affected directly by the library&#x27;s problems. But we do have our own budget that we are expected to make. There is some endowment money--we have a fund specifically earmarked to help offset production expenses. We use it to subsidize some titles that we want to be able to offer at something like &#x27;trade&#x27; prices but would otherwise be too expensive. Otherwise we are expected to cover our expenses through sales and other income streams like subrights. Heck, the university even expects us to pay for maintenance on our building. reply dieselgate 7 hours agoprevTIL the difference between \"divest\" and \"disinvest\".

While there were many authors that were professors, there were few books published by a university press. Are university presses a professors&#x27; first choice when it comes to publishing? reply allturtles 15 hours agoparentUniversity presses have less reach than a popular press, but the flip side of that is that they are willing to publish works only of interest to an academic audience. If you want to reach a wide audience, then, no, you don&#x27;t want to publish in a university press. However if you want to publish a detailed study on a niche subject, no popular press will want to touch that. That&#x27;s what the university presses are for. e.g., here&#x27;s a title I came across at Princeton University Press, \"A Velvet Empire: French Informal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century.\" Just based on the title, there&#x27;s no way some place like Penguin Random House is going to even look at that manuscript.The same author may approach different publishers depending on their intended audience. e.g. Daron Acemoglu published \"Introduction to Modern Economic Growth\" with Princeton but \"Why Nations Fail\" with Crown (a division of Penguin RandomHouse). reply dendrite9 10 hours agorootparentAnother example of a niche collection of books from a university is Duke press&#x27; Latin America collection. Someone recommended looking there for information on a question that came up in a discussion, I had no idea it existed as an outsider. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;read.dukeupress.edu&#x2F;latin-american-studies reply noelwelsh 13 hours agoparentprevMost of my technical books are from a University press.

If it&#x27;s a first-year undergrad text that is likely to be purchased by thousands of students, a publisher like Addison-Wesley will be interested. If it&#x27;s solidly mass market applied tech, like \"Master Javascript in 32 Seconds\" or something, someone like O&#x27;Reilly or Manning will probably take it. If it&#x27;s more niche and technical it&#x27;s likely to be a University press.University presses do publish some absolute bangers. Creating Symmetry, for example, is an absolutely beautiful book combining maths and art. MIT has a great series on game design. Cambridge is very strong in machine learning and maths. reply IKantRead 13 hours agoparentprevWow, that&#x27;s interesting because some of my favorite books are from university presses, often smaller ones (but MIT Press, Cambridge and Princeton are pretty well represented).I do find that my philosophy and critical theory books are the ones that more heavily come from university presses.

Thats why engineering and IT is often thought of as a cost center (because they often care more about the product) wheras marketing, sales etc are usually profit centers because they are able to direct their skills inwards to make a case for their own existance.Its a persuasion game about where resources will be spent to achieve most impact and for different companies the true answer will often be different. You need less marketing (but not none) if your product is premium. You need less product development (but not none) if your plan is to ship as much low quality garbage as possible. In between these the persuasion game is a distributed way of deciding strategy.There is a sort of almost-idea of risk vs quality, where some areas exist soley to prevent future risk to the company (IT meltdown, no roof over head, legal liability etc) where the rest work on the buisness. But under that thought the vast majority of operations are profit reply killjoywashere 15 hours agorootparentprevProfit centers directly produce profit. Cost centers may indirectly produce profit but the administration has a fundamentally different view of the assets.

When IT fixes some sale person&#x27;s laptop that will have a direct positive impact on that person&#x27;s sales, and thus on revenue. Spending too little on those IT people would have lost you revenue, conversely spending more might lead to more revenue.In the end it&#x27;s all a framework any company can apply as they want. You are right that a marketing department is much more likely to be judged by the company&#x27;s revenue (attributed by department as much as possible), while maintenance or IT support is unlikely to be judged by that criteria.

This includes those \"various learning platforms and knowledge hubs.\" The digitization of collections and repurposing of facilities is driven by cost cutting as well as hampered by it. Archival storage is not cheap (the conditions for special collections drive many librarians to drink) and renovating century old stacks into usable people space requires capital expenditures few libraries can scrape together.At the same time, Elsevier et al take larger and larger bites out of the budget for those digitized collections. The failure to invest in University presses will only exacerbate this in the long term. Attempts to provide an alternative to the for-profit parasites, e.g. open access platforms, wallow in grant funded misery with budgets considered laughable in the private sector. reply sheepshear 15 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s take nanohub.org as an example. It&#x27;s funded by an NSF grant and everyone can access it for free. A university doesn&#x27;t need to make any expenditures for their students to benefit from it.Researchers choose to publish in Elsevier&#x27;s journals, not for lack of a university press. reply atrettel 15 hours agoparentprevI have spent a lot of time in university libraries and the disinvestment is often difficult to see unless you are doing deep research or in the weeds.I should note that I am writing this response as somebody who is a professional researcher and scientist, not as an undergraduate student who needs to find a few references for a term paper. My needs are quite different than others and the library needs to cater to a wide range of people at all levels of research.Many universities are in fact repurposing libraries as \"study spaces\" or as \"learning centers\". This often means dedicating more space to meeting rooms and desks, etc. To get that space, libraries either put the books in storage or quite frankly sell the books, especially books that are not checked out that often. Many of the technical books that I own are former library books. Moreover, even well-resourced government labs (like DOE national laboratories) are selling their books. I know because I have bought some (albeit through a third party). Putting books in storage is the better option, because at least the books are available, but it removes the ability to browse the shelf for adjacent books (a highly underrated research method) and often requires preparation to request books and then wait for them to arrive in a reading room. That said, it is far better to put the books in storage.The availability of reference librarians is often greatly overstated. A library like the Library of Congress still has excellent reference librarians who often can perform apparent miracles to find difficult to locate information, but at university libraries, if I ask for a reference librarian, I often end up with an undergraduate assistant who does not really know much and cannot help you if you have a specific question to ask about locating something in a particular collection or how to use certain equipment like microfilm readers. Perhaps the undergrad can help other undergrads out, but when I was in grad school I never found this practice helpful when I needed specific information that I was already having difficulty finding.To summarize, this trend may benefit some people, but it comes at the expense of in-depth researchers and their needs.I will end by quibbling with that notion that \"most of the information is digitized\". The problem is that the Internet is so large that you can easily spend your whole life without ever realizing how shallow it really is in a single subject. Only once you go deep in that subject do you realize how much is not yet digitized in the first place. Yes, much information is digitized, but based on my experience, it is not \"most\". Some day that may change, but for the time being, physical libraries still play an important role here. reply sheepshear 14 hours agorootparentWith respect, I think I already addressed your quibble. I acknowledged the backlog of materials yet to be digitized and explained how to expedite it on an as-needed basis.It&#x27;s no more burdensome than it would be with more library funding. Storage is always necessary because big universities own several times more books than they could ever hope to shelve in their increasingly crowded campuses. Digging deep into a subject&#x27;s history can require materials that don&#x27;t exist in sufficient quantities for every interested library to have one, necessitating inter-library loans at a minimum.FYI Every online library catalog I&#x27;ve seen has a \"browse shelf\" feature.And how many times do you need to be shown how to use the microfilm machine? reply atrettel 13 hours agorootparentFair points, I was just trying to give an alternative perspective, especially since my needs are likely different than others on here. I appreciate the feedback.I tend to agree that storage is not a bad option, but so many libraries just cannot be bothered and would rather discard or sell materials.Fair point about the \"browse shelf\" feature of online catalogs, but I was talking about the ability to just open an adjacent book and just browse through the book itself. Instant access in other words. This is much more difficult if requesting things from storage, though the trick is to request several dozen books at once from storage. That is reasonable at some libraries but others will be greatly annoyed if you do that, due to limited shelf space for holds&#x2F;requests.You are right that I do not need to be shown how to use a microfilm machine, but often different libraries or archives have different practices and conventions about how to use their machines, especially for the purpose of preserving the microfilm. Being shown how to use it is more about learning their conventions and practices so that you can continue to have access to their collections later, and also to learn any issues with the machines themselves. For example, some institutions like the Smithsonian require you to wear special gloves when handling microfilm and limits where you can save any scans. Other places are completely free-form, but different machines have different quirks or could be down at the moment. Quirks include blurry images, need to wind the reels in a certain way, slow fast-forward (problem for longer reels), missing parts, susceptibility to nearby vibration, etc. If the undergrad helping you doesn&#x27;t even know what a microfilm machine is, I doubt they can truly help you figure out how to get this particular machine working right. I ended up figuring this stuff out myself, but I would have preferred some assistance from a professional to be honest. reply jrochkind1 13 hours agorootparentprev> FYI Every online library catalog I&#x27;ve seen has a \"browse shelf\" feature.As someone who works in the field, I&#x27;m not actually sure what you mean, and am curious. can you point me to an example of a \"browse shelf feature\" in a library catalog you have used and found helpful? I&#x27;m just curious to see what you are finding, and liking. reply atrettel 12 hours agorootparentThis is a feature of some online catalogs where it lists adjacent books on the shelf. This is usually done by the call number, so it basically just lets you see what the previous and next call numbers are. Given that the call numbers are usually within some sort of classification scheme, this is a quick way to find related material.For example, consider this book at the University of Maryland&#x27;s library:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;umaryland.on.worldcat.org&#x2F;oclc&#x2F;1594752Scroll down to the bottom to see \"Browse the Shelf\". Notice that the call numbers are sequential.The Library of Congress has a similar feature even though only librarians are able to access the stacks:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catalog.loc.gov&#x2F;vwebv&#x2F;searchBrowseI don&#x27;t mean to come off as dismissive of the feature. It is pretty useful! But I also value shelf access and just being able to dig into a book at a moment&#x27;s notice. reply sheepshear 8 hours agorootparentThank you for explaining it so well. Some libraries also have digital versions, allowing you to effectively browse the stacks from anywhere. The feature can and should be improved as it&#x27;s a bit clunky. Digitization is a slow process, but we&#x27;ll get there eventually. For now, we have growing pains. replypfdietz 15 hours agoparentprev> Most of the information is digitized, which has better reach.Previously, when university libraries had books and paper journals, anyone could read them. Now, members of the general public are not licensed to read electronic content there.So digitization has reduced the reach of the content, not increased it. reply sheepshear 13 hours agorootparentMany libraries have computers for accessing the catalog, which now includes all the digital media. You make a good argument for why they should if they don&#x27;t already. reply tw4l 15 hours agoparentprevFormer academic librarian and archivist here. It&#x27;s true that university libraries are changing their shape, as you say. More study space, fewer physical collections and book purchases (and, in some areas, universities moving toward sharing their physical collections in remote offsite storage and only calling back materials when requested), and much more investment in electronic resources like journal and database access.It&#x27;s a complicated issue, but in general library budgets have been consistently shrinking for years&#x2F;decades, even as the subscription costs for journal access from big for-profit like Elsevier skyrockets. It&#x27;s even gotten to the point where universities with endowments larger than many nations&#x27; GDPs are struggling to afford publisher prices (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2012&#x2F;apr&#x2F;24&#x2F;harvard-univ...).Decreasing library budgets plays into this, but at its heart I think that there&#x27;s a crisis of purpose as well. By not investing in open access publishing infrastructure themselves and not modifying the incentives for faculty review and tenure, universities have put themselves at the mercy of these for-profit publishers and are suffering for it. It&#x27;s hard to blame faculty who are vying for one of the ever-diminishing tenured spots for publishing their articles in the best journals they can, regardless of whether they&#x27;ll be behind a paywall, especially when the bar for tenure keeps getting higher and higher.So we find ourselves in a situation where universities and public funding agencies are paying academics to conduct research and do peer review, then faculty are giving the results to a for-profit publisher, who then sells access to the work right back to them at an astronomical fee.I&#x27;m hopeful if not optimistic that at some point, universities might choose to break out of the cat-and-mouse game they&#x27;re in by investing in open access publishing and incentivizing their faculty to use it rather than continuing to feed for-profit publishers&#x27; wild profits. I&#x27;ve seen some (too limited) action on the first part of that but pretty much none on incentivization part. Certain funding agencies are starting to require open access publication as a condition of some grants, but the change has been slow. reply wolverine876 13 hours agorootparentFor open access journals, why don&#x27;t professional associations (e.g., of history&#x2F;physics&#x2F;etc researchers&#x2F;professors&#x2F;etc) organize it, and declare that starting 01 Jan 2026, the Open Journal of Nanoscience will be the prestige publication, and Open Nanoscience Letters will be the second rank (or whatever roles are needed). Would anyone in the professional assocation have reason to object? Would support be widespread?University presses could handle the implementation (I know, more easily said than done, but they have the expertise). Cost reduction would appeal to university administrations.People do organize themselves and accomplish things, and with (guaranteed?) savings, (no?) opposition, (wide?) support, this one seems like low-hanging fruit - from my very outside perspective. reply bugglebeetle 8 hours agorootparentProfessional associations often do organize themselves and then proceed to engage in the same, hideous forms of profit seeking that the big names do, especially if their journals are high impact. The incentives are just wildly misaligned and an attitude of “if they get away with it, why shouldn’t we do the same” is pervasive. reply wolverine876 8 hours agorootparentWhich associations did that? reply sheepshear 8 hours agorootparentprevI think the challenge is that a university press is not interchangeable with a journal. reply cultofmetatron 15 hours agoprevLibraries need to change. most people go to the library to use the computers. what if we expanded the role of libraries to be places for autodidacts to learn and practice new skills? imagine a library full of maker equipment. 3d printers, sewing supplies, wood&#x2F;metal working equipment. the modest government investment would be paid back 10 fold in the amount of innovation an individual would be able to accoplish. reply trgn 15 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s already the model for a lot of libraries.

Many of these experts were presenting their work for free outside of lessons, and often times provided free food and drink to boot! Also, because my institution was larger, we often had scholars travel here to present their various works and even little get-togethers where multiple scholars from multiple fields collaborated and presented work.

It may have been mostly the Biology and Chemistry departments, but the quality of student there was still the highest of any school I&#x27;ve ever taken classes at, and that includes Georgia Tech, which is typically regarded as a top 10 engineering school. The reasons were somewhat peculiar and specific, but the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 80s left a whole lot of immigrants from former Soviet Republics fleeing the collapse and most of them ended up in LA. We had a whole lot of former engineers, scientists, and medical doctors who came to the US only to find their foreign credentials were not honored by US institutions and they had to start completely over.

That does not mean it is completely divorced from any truth, but it is not usefully informative by itself.Whether a society is capitalist or not does not define whether education is a right or a privilege. Another mistake is defining a country as capitalist and then shutting down any remaining capacity to think about it. Most countries contain a mixture of economic principles at work, so a surface level knowledge of capitalism that seems stuck in the 1800s will only leave you appearing naive and outdated.Which country is it again that created the internet and has helped expand education not only locally, but globally for all mankind to benefit?

And I thought the Meta attempt at a meta verse with cartoon characters looked ridiculous.But the video in the OP link, with the photo real avatars. This is a whole other level. It’s super cool.The fact that they made a ridiculous cartoon Metaverse first does not detract from the coolness of this photorealistic thing.Still, I’m not gonna use any Metaverse that Meta will make. Photoreal or otherwise. But that is because I dislike Meta as a company.The point is that what they have made here is some top notch stuff.I look forward to seeing Apple compete with this.

Or build a semi-realistic demo to a non technical audience.Anything in between will probably be met with confusion or people focusing on details that are not the concept that you are showcasing. reply bookaway 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not sure how much facebook paid Fridman for this podcast but whatever it was, whether it was 0 or 10 million, it&#x27;s probably the best value for money PR they&#x27;ve done in the last decade...or ever? reply koonsolo 3 hours agorootparentThis is how much they paid: \"Do you want to be the first one to interview Marc in the Metaverse or do we pick someone else?\" reply baby 7 hours agorootparentprevWhy would they pay Lex for this? It&#x27;s basically his full time job to do interviews for his podcast.That demo was going to happen one day or another as the tech progresses, and it&#x27;ll only get better from there. reply bookaway 1 hour agorootparentThe implication in my comment is that they might indeed have not paid him anything. And Fridman on principle may not have accepted payment even if offered. But who knows what type of deals go down behind the curtain in the podcasting world, it’s not unheard of to come across interviews that look like paid promotion where the podcaster doesn’t explicitly state it as such.But my point was more really that even if they paid him 10 million, the PR would have been worth it. >That demo was going to happen one day or another as the tech progressesYes, all amazing technology is going to happen eventually — no one really cares about that. They care about seeing it happen in the present, right in front of their eyes. The metaverse was mocked profusely in 2023, and we have gone through multiple cycles of “This is going to be the year of VR” in past decades. Tech stocks have been flat the last couple of months and Meta is a public company. No one on the outside would have batted an eye if they quietly shut this whole thing down after being so relentlessly mocked for the past year. So saying Zuckerberg doing this demo was inevitable after the fact is a bit flippant I think.And if facebook did a demo with a bunch of celebrities and put it on their website I’m not sure it would have the same effect as this long interview with Fridman. It wouldn’t have the same effect on me that’s for sure. And I’m pretty sure they would have paid those celebrities. reply gfodor 12 hours agoparentprevThey didn&#x27;t, people just haven&#x27;t been paying attention. They&#x27;ve been working on these avatars for almost a decade in parallel waiting for the hardware to catch up. The cartoon avatars are a function of hardware limitations. reply rapjr9 10 hours agoparentprevIt is definitely not perfect. It doesn&#x27;t seen to track distortions of the skin on the face, such as around the mouth on the cheeks. It tracks eye blinks, but does it track pupil dilation? Doesn&#x27;t seem like it could track forehead creases, though possibly. Do the avatar&#x27;s eyebrows track the real eyebrows? No way to tell, but an important part of expression. I rarely see the eyes moving, maybe an artifact of being in a dark space with only one thing to look at? Pursing of the lips is not tracked. Tongue? I don&#x27;t see shoulders moving. It&#x27;s an impressive demo, yet as a repeated life experience it probably would start to feel artificial and uncanny. The video does discuss some of this. I get the impression some of it is prediction and some of it is tracking. reply wbm1 54 minutes agorootparentAll things that will come with time.

It most likely is just an unimplemented feature; they also could have \"cheated\" by chroma-keying a 2D-texture background or rotoscoped the avatars onto a another 3D room scene, but what&#x27;s the point when its just talking heads? reply wryanzimmerman 6 hours agorootparentI think a large part of the black background choice was to hide the missing bodies; any light past chest level is going to push this into uncanny valley pretty fast because the modeling ends at the chest like talking Greek busts.Totally agree that it’s a stylistic and presentational decision and not a computational limitation. reply nitwit005 12 hours agorootparentprevSurely people have higher expectations for the environment their avatar is going to be in than a literal box?Games often only have the highest detail models present in cutscenes, where the rest of the game can be limited, and the camera can be controlled to limit how many characters are visible. reply sangnoir 9 hours agorootparent> Surely people have higher expectations for the environment their avatar is going to be in than a literal box?Yes - they do, but you don&#x27;t have to get fancy with the environment for 2 static avatars locked in place.

My wife hasn&#x27;t played a lot of games, and when Vader showed up she was genuinely terrified -- she&#x27;s refused to do anything in VR since because it felt too real and too scary. reply bellgrove 13 hours agoprevSlightly of off topic, but how did Fridman get to the point that he could pull big tech C-execs and celebrities onto his podcast? He has such a monotone voice (no shade meant, I am the same way, no matter how hard I try otherwise) and - this might just be personal taste - but I feel like this unedited long-form interview format is the lowest bar. I would have thought that an excellent interviewer would generally be considered one who is efficient at extracting interesting data (or can at least edit it to appear so) and can engage with & challenge the interviewee; long-form seems like the opposite of this. reply nvarsj 1 hour agoparentHe&#x27;s done a great job of marketing himself as a non judgemental platform for celebs. He&#x27;s a super positive guy and basically lets his interviewees guide the conversation, and let&#x27;s the viewer make up their own mind.I actually like his interviews, because he typically speaks less than his interviewees and doesn&#x27;t guide the viewer to a certain opinion. Even his interview with Kanye West was like this - it was pretty insightful into Kanye&#x27;s state of mind and didn&#x27;t need any commentary. reply aragonite 1 hour agoparentprev> I would have thought that an excellent interviewer would generally be considered one who is efficient at extracting interesting data (or can at least edit it to appear so) and can engage with & challenge the interviewee ...I agree with the earlier part but disagree with this part of the comment. If the interviewee is someone particularly interesting, I learn a lot more about them when the interviewer just throws softball questions to help the interviewee more or less free-associate. Most of the time when an interviewer tries to \"challenge\" or \"ask hard questions\" it comes across as cringeworthy and a waste of time that could have been better spent letting the interviewee speak their mind. reply TheAceOfHearts 10 hours agoparentprevI enjoy Lex&#x27;s podcast, but he&#x27;s been extremely well connected from the start.

Which apparently is not far off from reality - they joke about Fridman doing a podcast where he interviews an AI version of himself in the near future. Reminds me a bit of that Black Mirror episode where Miley Cyrus&#x27; character has AI versions of herself contained, or trapped, within consumer electronics.It also occurs to me that this could be a useful technology for people with social anxiety who have to endure uncontrollable blushing when conversing in real life, or people with awkward facial tics.

I dislike the idea of having cameras pointed at everything all the time, and the idea of having such tight integration between digital and physical makes me uneasy. It feels like a subtle push to help enable NFT-style content in the longterm. Maybe this is a sign that I&#x27;m growing old, and it&#x27;ll be completely natural for the younger generation.The technological showcase is really cool though. Right now people are paying dozens of thousands of dollars for fully rigged vtuber avatars and 3D virtual chat models, but in a few years we&#x27;ll probably have AI tooling that allows you to do it yourself.The discussion of non-human avatars made me wonder what kind of fantasy avatar Mark and Lex would use. If profile pictures are any kind of indication, I suspect a large number of tech users will opt to be cute anime girls. The days of catgirl-ification grow ever closer.They discuss an idea of having celebrities and famous people train AI models so fans can interact with them. That seems so dangerous, arguably pushing parasocial relationships to a completely new level. It feels like it fundamentally hacks the human brain.

Some people don’t know how to do it no matter how simple, but that’s more rare. And some people purposely choose to keep an old photo because they want to be seen the way that they once were rather than the way that they are now.Me for one, I will keep my 3d scan up to date every now and then. Say, every few months or so. Just like how I currently update my profile picture every few months on platforms that I actively use. (For example, I’ve been at my current company for about a year now, and in that time I’ve changed my Slack and company GitLab profile pics one time – from the picture I chose when I joined, to a new up to date photo).Anyway. I am sure that if people stick to old scans, the Metaverse companies will eventually counter that by virtually “aging” the scanned models that people use. So that even if you don’t change your scanned model, the Metaverses will add grey hairs, wrinkles, etc to it over time. reply kevinsync 13 hours agoparentprevRed Dead Redemption 2 (5 years old at this point) has natural hair growth, barber shops, hygiene, body shapes that change based on diet, plus a host of other time-oriented realistic simulation.

Thanks, Zuckerberg\"I actually think this may help enable remote work in the long run as companies who are unwilling to accept the current WFH&#x2F;hybrid models see this as a viable compromise.More importantly, when I call my supplier in Belgium, I&#x27;ll be able to see them \"face-to-face\" (avatar-to-avatar?) and develop a more human relationship than just exchanging emails or phone calls.> \"Great, social relationships are going to be even worse\"If that&#x27;s the use you want to make of it, sure.

Video games and other fully 3D environments tend to avoid photorealism at all cost, because it&#x27;s compute-expensive and ugly. By comparison, simple cartoon characters, blobs or robots are inoffensive and perfectly usable abstractions.

For example, I noticed that Lex&#x27;s and Mark&#x27;s eyebrows don&#x27;t seem to move as much as you might expect given the emotions communicated by their voices.

Maybe it’s just not clear to me. I feel like we collectively view it negatively, but that’s also built on the premise that we search users consume a free utility that Google provides to us and is now some ethical requirement for them to maintain. They have no ethical obligation to do that.It’s also pretty common for public companies to try to shift volume to higher revenue or margin products when they’re pacing short of consensus.That said, you can always override a bonus plan and pay even when they fall short of their sales plan. It seemed like that was the entire catalyst of this conversation, wanting the ads team to hit their bonus.If y’all think this is unethical, you should hear the conversations I was privy to about how hospitals execs were considering halting patient admissions during the pandemic because nursing labor got expensive and breaking even was deemed unacceptable. The government upped reimbursements and same hospital execs made massive windfall bonuses reply TT2048 7 hours agorootparentUser value and company revenue, in general, form a [pareto frontier](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pareto_front). The company can pick an \"angle\" (trade off some user value for more profits and vice-versa) but both extremes are bad in the long term. They need to strike a balance.A company that continuously invests their efforts on maximum revenue subtraction eventually pushes their users out. Similarly, a company that invests too much into research and present user satisfaction, particularly when users don&#x27;t pay for the product, is set to have some financial and economical problems in the future.I think this is borderline ethical. For sure it&#x27;s over 9000 in the Maquiavellian scale (I mean the gymnastics behind \"please don&#x27;t say that this is us pushing for worse results, that&#x27;s a very negative message\" are genius and I can see that working really well under certain circumstances in a corporate setup), but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s unethical _necessarily_. reply hutzlibu 9 hours agoparentprev\"It&#x27;s a good rule of thumb for professional ethics in general.\"So is it to have your strategy guided by general accepted ethics, or to not speak about your real strategy in open words? reply godelski 8 hours agorootparent> So is it to have your strategy guided by general accepted ethicsThis is the generally accepted interpretation of the words.

Does chrome really control the ads injected into the search results from google? I had assumed that was directly from google.

I&#x27;m a big believer in \"decision support systems\". Find out what decisions your customers need to make, repeatedly, to their job. Quantify the heuristics and visualize that information (and that information only) in an easy to consume manner. More often than not that&#x27;s an email or PDF. Another advantage is that by supporting the business users they feel less threatened by the changes or technology.I think \"self-serve\" analytics is silly, the idea that you put all of the data in front of people and they&#x27;ll derive \"insights\". That&#x27;s not how normal people or data work. We just had a discussion on HN the other day about Facebook&#x27;s Prophet, and its pitfalls. Meanwhile we expect Joe in sales to be able to identify useful trends on a chart he made. Every company needs to forecast, regardless of their sophistication. That stuff needs to be defined by the right people and given to the users. reply amcaskill 21 hours agoparentI helped build the analytics group at a PE fund, and this really fits with my experience.Good decision support is where most of the value is, and it’s about building things that draw conclusions, not just throwing the data over the fence with 50 filters and expecting the end consumer to do the actual analysis.I now work on an open source, code-based BI tool called Evidence, which incorporates a lot of these ideas, and might be of interest to people in this thread.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;evidence-dev&#x2F;evidencePrevious discussions on HN:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28304781 - 91 commentshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35645464 - 97 comments reply happytiger 20 hours agorootparentAgree with both of you, and would add that knowing who is using the system, and what they need to get out of it is really the key to making them shine.Too many systems have too much data for too many customer categories and end up being useless to everybody. reply eitally 21 hours agoparentprevThis is it, really. I remember back during a previous section of my career when I was running BI for a manufacturing company. We were asked to web-ify some legacy reports that either ran on desktops using Access & Excel or were on older BI products (Cognos). It was shocking -- at the time (I was naive) -- how many business requirements were essentially \"replicate Excel in a browser\", and completely divorced from the actual business processes and decisions that needed to be made.Also, it might surprise a lot of less experienced developers just how many reporting tools are actually pieces of a workflow, not just reports. If you sniff this out during the requirements phase, do your best to convert these reports into features of an actual workflow app&#x2F;system rather than allow them to persist as standalone reports. reply itsoktocry 21 hours agorootparent>either ran on desktops using Access & Excel or were on older BI products (Cognos).

Low hanging fruit. reply jp_monteiro 17 hours agoparentprevI agree that the term \"self-service analytics\" (especially the &#x27;analytics&#x27; part) and \"insights\" just passes the wrong image of the real need of business users out there. It mixes &#x27;strategic insights&#x27; with &#x27;operational needs&#x27;. And I think self-service needs to be about operationalizing data. Sales managers are not necessarily looking to &#x27;analyze&#x27; data or &#x27;get an insight&#x27;. They need answers from data to manage their team. They need to track well-defined KPIs. See how their salespeople are doing and be able to have a productive meeting to tell them what they are neglecting. Customer success people need to \"pull some data real quick\" on the usage of the product by a certain client before a meeting.These things happen all the time. And yet most companies out there think that the solution is to just build a bunch of dashboards, foreseeing what everyone will ask in the future. And then nobody checks the dashboards. Or finds the right one. And then they have a team of SQL translators pulling data for ad-hoc questions. That&#x27;s silly IMO.I&#x27;m obviously biased as a founder of a self-service analytics company based on AI (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.veezoo.com).

You want to make more profits, right? That means we need to either increase revenues or decrease costs. Are we measuring all these things (you&#x27;d be surprised at the number of seemingly successful companies who can&#x27;t)? Okay, how do we affect revenue? By increasing the number of users or increasing the revenue per user. Are we measuring those things? And on and on. It&#x27;s a perfect way to iterate, and as the company matures it can be infinitely more and more sophisticated.

Most of the time the initial question is very loosely defined, but actually having these conversations with the people who \"want data\", and helping them structure their thinking is also a hugely rewarding part of working in data and analytics, and will help you advance in your career.It can be easy to have a cynical view of what people are asking for, but in my experience there is often real value you can uncover.One thing which helped me a lot is having a decent understanding of accounting and finance. A fun, and fairly quick, way to develop that is by taking a course on financial modelling (in excel).

For most executives, something in their email is best; they are there anyway, no logging in to anything. reply grvdrm 22 hours agoprevI&#x27;ll enjoy watching this thread evolve. Some thoughts from my experience:- Everyone asks to translate simpler spreadsheets and Excel charts&#x2F;graphs into dashboards in your BI tool of choice. As soon as it&#x27;s there, they&#x27;ll ask you why they can&#x27;t export to manage the data themselves. This vicious cycle can sometimes be stopped but is a slow-motion drag on productivity in lots of orgs.- Build in validations, and&#x2F;or work on ways to check the dashboard. Dashboards sometimes put their builders and consumers on auto-pilot. The dashboard \"must be right\" but could easily have a bug or inaccuracy for weeks&#x2F;months&#x2F;etc. that isn&#x27;t obvious without some external validation.- The dashboard never has the \"right\" metrics - users will continue asking for changes. Be your best advocate and say no as a way of understanding the importance of the ask- Related: always ask why about everything you&#x27;re building into or modifying in dashboards. Business users often ask for things without an ounce of rationale.- Related: taking away is harder than not doing at all!Finally, I think most dashboards miss one fundamental point. Imagine you&#x27;re the CEO&#x2F;COO and you&#x27;ve got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you&#x27;re seeing? What&#x27;s the succinct summary?I like building in spots to write 2-3 sentence executive summaries. reply conductr 21 hours agoparentI work closely on BI projects but from a finance perspective. The concept I like to explain to the BI teams is that the dashboard is always just a snapshot of “what” is happening. But the underlying base level data is always needed to understand “why” it’s happening. And without the why, there’s no actual intelligence gain.Take a metric like Average Order Value (AOV). It may be ; total sales &#x2F; order quantity. But as that metric is used it’s often being compared to something like last year, last month, or a plan and anyone interested in that number is really interested in understanding the “why” it has changed from some other point in time&#x2F;scenario.For that, you actually need to bring in line item details behind orders as each order has multiple products&#x2F;skus and they likely sold at different prices from a year ago or what was expected in a plan. An analysis of this has a name, price-volume-mix analysis or PVM.I always seem to have to explain this to BI teams when I join a new company and am seeking data. I’m currently going through it with a BI team, that apparently the BI tool wouldn’t store this information. It’s like it only stores aggregate values so it’s not even possible to get base level data for analysis (without major architectural changes). I don’t know if that’s normal in BI or was an implementation decision at some point but I’ve come across this same thing on a handful of companies and as I said I really have to drive this concept for those teams. When I ask of it I’m usually met with a “why would you need that info &#x2F; give us a use case”. Which means, the don’t even understand how un-intelligent their BI tool is or why the execs likely aren’t feeling like investing in BI has been worthwhile (eg. Ever build a dashboard that then goes unused? I probably wasn’t perceived as useful for some reason like this).This could be more concise put as, understanding your end users needs. Understand the difference of what people ask for is often different than what they need. If they ask for AOV metrics, they’re really saying “I need to understand AOV” and that’s done via PVM analysis. reply grvdrm 20 hours agorootparentSimilarly titled towards finance.

I once was conversing the COO of my company (my last job), at a 1000+ person company, and asked him if he thought more concise requests for things would drive productivity. He, point blank, said: \"sometimes I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m asking for\"I&#x27;ve remembered that moment for years. In so many situations, the actual BI&#x2F;dashboard is the least important part of the puzzle.

Funny to stumble on this because just last week I told someone on our BI team, there is not any one \"use case\" I can lay out. The use case is this, assume I need to answer any random question that comes up. I need analytical enablement not a fancy dashboard in most instances. It&#x27;s not to say dashboards don&#x27;t have their place, but they&#x27;re just the easily digestible summary of underlying data that&#x27;s meant to highlight areas and raise those questions about \"why...\" reply SeriousM 2 hours agorootparentOh thank you guys! I came to this post with the thinking of \"dashboards are hard to build and when they exist it&#x27;s hard to extend them\". My boss is asking me from time to time to add yet another dashboard to grafana and all I can do is add another piece of specific inner working values because lack of traces - the \"what\" part. Up until now if was as if a car driver is asking for the average air volume intake yet in really he probably needs the \"why\" the air volume changes. The \"probably\" part is important here: if the driver is the test-driver then he needs the actual value, the what; is the driver the track performance guy he needs the why; and sometimes they need booth values because they feel more secure with more information. You guys just opened my eyes, thank you! reply proamdev123 14 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a fantastic point. The unstated underlying request isn’t to see the same chart, the same way, every week&#x2F;month&#x2F;quarter.

The visual aspects of dashboards can easily drift over time even if the data is correct.

Imagine you&#x27;re the CEO&#x2F;COO and you&#x27;ve got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you&#x27;re seeing? What&#x27;s the succinct summary?Having been on both sides of this, I think the challenge is that the CEO&#x2F;COO&#x27;s job is to figure out \"what should we do about this?,\" which is the right approach to coming up with that summary (it&#x27;s not just \"here&#x27;s a text version of the chart\"). And the corollary challenge is that, in most cases, non-technical people with domain knowledge are the ones who need to produce the analysis: so any feature incomplete dashboard is going to stymie them and any general framework that requires a technical person to step in for code or configuration is going to slow the process to a crawl.It&#x27;s the rule (not the exception) that (especially if things are going poorly) the next step is asking more questions, which involves investigating something else in more detail. A dashboard, however pretty, is as useless as a doorknob if it doesn&#x27;t have the needed information.I have found that dashboards per say are always great as the high-level KPI trackers, like the things you would consider hanging on a wall in an office (e.g. \"revenue growth this month\" or \"new customers acquired\"). You&#x27;ll always want to know that information, and many people of unrelated departments need to have that information shared to them.The other helpful area is a deep-dive domain-specific analytics programs, like for example Google Analytics, where it has a very full featureset for non-technical marketing people to go in and drill down to answer questions. The UI&#x2F;UX designers of that product have spent years honing and A&#x2F;B testing which types of graphs to show where, and mapping out how to have people click around to find what they&#x27;re looking for, to the point it is pretty easy for non-technical people. They even have courses and certifications on how to use the system.Organizations that try to internally build a feature-complete system like google analytics for a specific domain need to consider it like building an entire software product (even if there&#x27;s a general low&#x2F;no-code BI SaaS to assist) because you&#x27;ll need collaboration between general technical experts and non-technical stakeholders with changing and vague requirements. It can be done, but likely only with years of investment and UI&#x2F;UX research, just like any other software product that solves a domain problem well. In practice: millions of dollars.Technologists often forget that Excel *is* a turing complete programming language (and it&#x27;s a functional programming paradigm too!). If an org is not committed to spend years and millions of dollars on deep dive analytics for a specific domain, the right choice is almost always using a commercial analytics system for that domain that costs less than the internal build, or embracing the trusty spreadsheet. reply itsoktocry 21 hours agorootparent>I think the challenge is that the CEO&#x2F;COO&#x27;s job is to figure out \"what should we do about this?Totally agree.

It took me a very long time to learn that this design is entirely cookie-cutter for good reason. Users always want the same things: stats, breakdowns, filters and drill-downs.Is there any chance you could link an image of what a good version of this looks like? reply tobr 21 hours agoprevIn my experience, if your plan is to make a “dashboard”, you’re already on the wrong path. It’s too generic and says nothing about what problems you are there to solve. Think about it yourself: in how many of the products that are important in your life is there any meaningful value produced by a dashboard?Dashboards seem alluring because we imagine that users will sit there and somehow have insights delivered to them automatically. It’s often less clear what those insights will be or what is needed to produce them, we somehow hope they will materialize by just displaying some data. Often the focus is on making pretty-looking charts (which only ever look good when you demo with picturesque fake data), because you want the product to feel colorful, welcoming and visual.A better approach is to either make a focused tool for solving a specific problem you know users have - you won’t think of what you end up with as a “dashboard” but it might occasionally end up looking a little like one - or to make general tools that allow users to dig through data interactively to find the things they care about. reply hjkm 1 minute agoparentI think that&#x27;s a really useful thought exercise.

Also don’t get fancy with our visuals. Lots of big metric kpi visuals, tabular visuals, line charts & bar charts. They should be able to glance at the visuals and immediately known what’s going on and get sense of what the visual is conveying.Another thing customers love is the dynamic ability we give them to be able to switch how certain visuals are grouped or what value is being displayed. We can’t for see all the different ways users will want to slice and dice the data so giving them that ability was huge. reply ravdeepchawla 22 hours agoprevBiggest lesson: all metrics _must_ be defined in code, not manager-speak.For instance, if a marketing head wants to plot CAC (cost of acquiring customers) over time, saying CAC is number of customers divided by marketing spend is manager-speak. Spends are budgeted higher early in the month and adjusted with actuals. Customers ask for refunds and cancel accounts. Some campaigns have volume incentives which are known later... and so on.

You want to build UI to be config driven. At some point, adding a new chart in code will not scale. Writing good config is hard and require a lot of careful thinking.2. Product owners want special snowflake, try to push back on any customization as it increase complexity and make config harder. It is better to implement usable search, navigation, sitemap or focus on developer experience (CI&#x2F;CD, feature flags etc.)3. GraphQL is overrated, for complex charts with filters and multiple options it makes caching hard to use in practice. I would like to try tRPC next time or similar rpc based approach.4. Performance impact of large bundles in minimal in practice. You can be shipping 20MB of JS to users, but inefficient re-renders&#x2F;re-fetches will have way more impact that amount of code. For charting, I would try ECharts or any commercial WebGL based charting library. For tables, I would try something that mimic excel as closely as possible.5. Centralize state of application via redux&#x2F;signals&#x2F;jotai. You want to have clear separation between config and state of components. You want to build this as early as possible. I guarantee that product would want to have URL sharing and adding this later is very difficult.6. Designers love whitespace, You should fight for information density as much as possible.

Cache data, or initially load only summary data, or only load the latest day by default and then fetch the weeks data.

Relevant: Don&#x27;t just build a dashboard for the sake of building a dashboard. First, understand what the goal of the user is, and what metrics they&#x27;ll want to look at to understand their progress towards that goal2. Reliable: You only have one shot to get this one right. As soon as you present incorrect data to your users, you&#x27;ve lost their trust forever, so make sure you have solid tooling in place across your data stack that ensures data quality, from collection, through transformations to query time3. Accessible: The data the user will be looking at needs to be either self explanatory, or the user has to have access to documentation that describes the data they&#x27;re looking at in detail.For point 1&#x2F;, here&#x27;s a framework to help you identify which metrics to focus on: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avo.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tracking-the-right-product-metrics reply revenga99 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;m currently in the middle of building an overly complicated analytics platform where there is a \"easy mode\" and an \"advanced mode\" they pick the devices and metrics they want on the graph, and if they toggle advanced it shows the sql it used to create the graph. So then they can edit the sql or do whatever they want.Giving customers \"secure\" sql access was a must have feature from upper management, and it was very tricky&#x2F;a nightmare to get right.Customers actually liked it though, sql is king.Advise I would give is make sure your analytics api&#x27;s data models and queries are well though out and extensible. It makes it very hard to change them and rework the ux. reply telecomsteve 22 hours agoprevLesson learned: start with fewer metrics and observe how they are used and interpreted. It is much easier to expand correctly from there. Collecting requirements in a single pass and building a monolith is rarely as productive as it seems - because the barrier to adding things and shifting responsibility to the dashboard is so low in the beginning, that it can easily become a dumping ground. reply hughess 21 hours agoprevI spent 5 years leading a data team which produced reports for hundreds of users.In our team’s experience, the most important factor in getting engagement from users is including the right context directly within the report - definitions, caveats, annotations, narrative. This pre-empts a lot of questions about the report, but more importantly builds trust in what the data is showing (vs having a user self-serve, nervous that they’re making a decision with bad data - ultimately they’ll reach out to an analyst to get them to do the analysis for them).The second most important factor was loading speed - we noticed that after around 8 seconds of waiting, business users would disengage with a report, or lose trust in the system presenting the information (“I think it’s broken”). Most often this resulted in people not logging in to look at reports - they were busy with tons of other things, so once they expected reports to take a while to load, they stopped coming back.The third big finding was giving people data where they already are, in a format they understand. A complicated filter interface would drive our users nuts and turned into many hours of training and technical support. For this reason, we always wanted a simple UI with great mobile support for reports - our users were on the go and could already do most other things on their phones.We couldn’t achieve these things in BI tools, so for important decisions, we had to move the work to tools that could offer text support, instant report loading, and a familiar and accessible format: PowerPoint, PDF, and email. Of course this is a difficult workflow to automate and maintain, but for us it was crucial to get engagement on the work we were producing, and it worked.This experience inspired my colleague and I to start an open source BI tool which could achieve these things with a more maintainable, version controlled workflow. The tool is called Evidence (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evidence.dev) if anyone is interested. reply kwillets 11 hours agoparentIronically one of the major uses of analytics has been to highlight the impact of slow response time on user retention for a wide class of applications.I also feel that speed builds trust, although I don&#x27;t know specifically why.

It certainly shows more understanding of the data to present it quickly. reply Klaster_1 21 hours agoprevAs a developer who works on a database management system monitoring tools, user-facing monitoring dashboards have been my bane for a while. I don&#x27;t know much about the situation in other companies and products, but here are the main pain points I&#x27;ve encountered:1. Nobody knows what to monitor exactly, every new dashboard is based on a guess.2. Not much user feedback to base the decisions on if you don&#x27;t have much users to begin with.3. Often, the metrics exposed by the app under the monitoring prove grossly inadequate or suitable metrics do not exist.4. You can&#x27;t just add new metrics. Users have to update the whole distributed app for the new metric to become available. This has to be accounted for at the UI design stage.5. Somebody has to spend a significant amount of time gathering all the information from random people in the company, because see 1. reply ruimedon 1 hour agoprevI had a read through some of the comments here and it seems to me that the predominant stance is that reports are only useful for understanding the what and the why is addressed through more focused, thorough analysis. Also, most comments mention self-serve analytics are silly because stakeholders often don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re looking for or they rather have a summary.I understand this, but I disagree with some of this or have trouble understanding how this can be applied in practice:- Reports can absolutely be built in a way that is flexible enough to enable knowledge discovery. If instead of creating a chart that plots Conversion Rate over time, instead create a chart that plots a Primary Metric against a Primary Dimension and use parameters to allow users to choose what the Primary Metric and Primary Dimension are. This drastically reduces the maintenance costs of reports because you don&#x27;t need to create more charts, rather you just need to make new data available.- This design strategy can be expanded to Secondary Metrics, Secondary Segments and Splits to enable comparison between segments. This is a big step towards finding out the why- If you&#x27;re a big business with both a team of BI developers and a team of Data Analysts I can imagine you&#x27;ll have plenty of resources to conduct more thorough analysis whenever they are needed. But if you&#x27;re a startup, you probably have a few Analytics Engineers doing both BI development and analysis. How do you enable them to do both if stakeholders most often don&#x27;t know what they need? You have to be efficient and I don&#x27;t think that means having these few Analytics Engineers holding stakeholders hands through a series of discussions to figure out what the hell do they even need...- Why would you not want everyone in the business to be able to discover new things in the data? Why only allow data analysts to do that? If you provide a platform that enables data exploration in a guided way to avoid wrong use&#x2F;interpretation of data, isn&#x27;t it best to open it up to everyone? More people looking into data = more hypotheses = higher probability that at least one of them will be proven and very impactful.- I think there are different types of data work: setting up data architecture to collect and transform data into a format that enables easy analysis; building solutions for monitoring KPIs (the what); building solutions for understanding the drivers of KPI fluctuations (the why); advanced analytics to support decision making (the actions).

Is it observable? Is it monitorable? Can you make changes quickly at different stages? How do overrides work? Does your data pipeline have entitlements? (Can private data points be provisioned to specific users?)- Should you implement your own dashboard? Or are you reinventing the wheel? Can you reuse&#x2F;recycle existing BI tools? What are the licenses involved? Power BI is proprietary to microsoft and will have per user economics. Grafana is AGPL, be very careful with anything AGPL in your tech stack because it may force you to open source your code. Apache Superset is pretty cool. I&#x27;ve seen big startup valuations with off-the-shelf BI tools. If its an MVP, definitely consider using this as opposed to rolling your own.- Making assumptions for your users is bad because users will always ask for more. So building a flexible framework where users can add&#x2F;remove visuals and build their own analytics may be necessary. The flipside is this adds complexity and can confuse the user.

It can be tough to figure out what the end user needs in the first place, let alone the details of how to define individual metrics or slice the data. This is a huge pain point for both externally and internally facing deliverables, but it&#x27;s especially tough for external clients because you&#x27;re likely a lot more limited in your ability to communicate ad-hoc to clarify things down the line. And once you&#x27;ve delivered something that&#x27;s either irrelevant or inaccurate, then it can end up being game over for the engagement (if you&#x27;re working externally) or your counterpart&#x27;s trust in your output (if you&#x27;re working internally).So it&#x27;s super important to get on the same page RE: goals and expectations and keep that alignment going to the end - so that there aren&#x27;t any unpleasant surprises at the delivery stage.

So large amounts of work go into building dashboards that are used for a very short amount of time and then discarded. Probably we should do a better job on one-off analyses and only dashboard after the fact.Many users don&#x27;t actually want a dashboard, what they actually want is a live data dump into excel where they can pivot table it. Maybe, maybe a bar or line chart.In general, I find people always ask for more filters, more slicers, just endless options to reconfigure the data as they please. But they quickly become trapped in a swamp of their own making, now nobody knows how this should be sorted or sliced, does it even make sense to do it this way? People think what they want is a &#x27;data democracy&#x27; with hundreds of dashboards with hundreds of options with hundreds of users and so they ask for and usually receive it. But they usually just end up coming back to the data team and asking - &#x27;so what&#x27;s the answer?&#x27; What many orgs need is actually a data dictator.On the other hand, dashboards do allow you to establish really good feedback loops within the business so when you can identify an ongoing constraint, figure out how to track it and then force people to receive it on a regular cadence and be accountable to it, you can make a lot of headway. But that&#x27;s a more niche use-case than how they&#x27;re frequently used and the skills involved are different - less visualization skills, more business analysis - and you need to be positioned to make sure someone is held accountable. reply keiferkif 20 hours agoprevfrom what I&#x27;ve seen people just want the data dumped into an Excel document so they can do their own analytics. reply syndicatedjelly 20 hours agoprev [–] Tons of great advice in the comments. At risk of repeating others, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned working on business intelligence tools for an engineering group:- What users ask for and what users really want are often extremely different.- Engineering executives like to place their \"thumbprint\" on every business analytics dashboard. They want evidence that the \"intelligence\" being reported has been customized by them. It&#x27;s their way of imparting branding on the organization.- UI&#x2F;UX is far more important to users than how you handle the technical details. When discussing implementation with them, start with the UI so that they have a mental model to build from.- Leave space to create cool things that you&#x2F;your team want to make. The developers of BI dashboards often have excellent ideas for visualizing data that an end-user would not immediately think of. Leave room to \"delight\".- Never assume the data is clean or accurate (even when there are regulatory reasons for it to be either of those things)- Not everyone&#x27;s opinion is equally valuable.- Beware of corporate politics. I once had an analytics project completely shut down because it would expose certain weaknesses in the business that were not acceptable to discuss publicly.Bonus: Read \"Envisioning Information\" by Edward Tufte. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Grant Winney Dec 30, 2019 11 min 50 Comments I was checking the status of a FedEx order when Brave warned me that \"this site has been blocked from accessing your motion sensors\". I'm struggling to understand why a website would need that access. Do I get a different experience if I drop my device? Tip my monitor over? Spin the mouse around? Table of Contents What are Web APIs? Geolocation API Notifications API Sensors API Why are sites requesting the Sensors API? An obfuscated file, from Akamai Deobfuscating it leads to code that suggests Akamai A reference to cformanalytics.com, registered to Akamai It seems safe to assume it's Akamai But why do they expect desktops to have an accelerometer? Guess 1: Their script doesn't handle responsive websites correctly Guess 2: They provide two scripts, but companies only implement one I was checking the status of a FedEx order in Brave, when I noticed a notification in the address bar that I've never seen before. It was warning me that \"this site has been blocked from accessing your motion sensors\". Wut? It doesn't even need to be an order status - their home page kicks it up too. I'm struggling to understand why a website would need access to a motion sensor on a mobile device, let alone the fact I was using a desktop. Do I get a different experience if I knock my PC off the desk? Tip my monitor on its side? Grab the mouse cord and spin it around my head really fast? After a few cursory online searches, I'm coming up with little other than a few threads on Reddit and Brave that indicate people are also seeing this on Kayo Sports and Twitch, as well as Experian and Tutanota. Guess it's time to dig a little deeper. What are Web APIs? Before zeroing in on sensors, let's backup a sec and talk about web design and Web APIs. Your browser has access to a lot of data via (and metadata regarding) the device you installed it on. As much as some of the websites you visit would looove to have access to all that data, any decent browser acts as a firewall, blocking that access by default and prompting you to allow it. Geolocation API One of the more common APIs is the one used to request your location, usually when you're using a websites's \"store locator\" to find the store nearest you. The button below uses code (lightly modified) from MDN's Geolocation API docs. When you click it, the JavaScript code executes a call to navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(), asking the browser for your location. Show my location Your browser prompts you to allow access, which you can deny. Yay privacy. If you don't see the prompt but you think you've allowed it, there are two different settings that control access - a global page with a list of \"blocked\" and \"allowed\" sites, and a per-site page where you can adjust all permissions for a single site. In Chrome, just replace brave:// with chrome:// in the address bar. Notifications API Another (unfortunately, very) popular API is the one used to display notifications to visitors. Using the Notifications API, you can request permission from a visitor with a call to Notification.requestPermission() and then just create a new Notification() to annoy them keep them up to date. (May not work in Brave due to a bug.) Notify me! Sensors API There's a (maybe sorta?) new API for requesting access to sensors in Chromium-based browsers (Ghacks puts it at Chrome 75, around June 2019, but wikipedia suggests Chrome 67 around May 2018). It's not widely supported yet. According to MDN, the only major browsers that currently support it are Chrome and Opera, on desktop and mobile. Check out the MDN docs, the W3C candidate recommendation, the ongoing conversation over at Chrome, and Intel's Sensor API playground for examples. The following links execute some JavaScript code to try starting up various sensors, which should trigger the sensor icon in the address bar. (If an error occurs, it'll display below the links.) Try Accelerometer Try AmbientLightSensor Try Gyroscope Try LinearAccelerationSensor Try Magnetometer Try AbsoluteOrientationSensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) Try RelativeOrientationSensor (accelerometer, gyroscope) Status Message: As with the geolocation and notification APIs, you can grant or deny access at the global or per-site level. What's kind of annoying is that all of the above sensors fall under a single \"motion sensors\" umbrella, so you can't easily tell which of those sensors a particular site is trying to access. Why are sites requesting the Sensors API? I've seen the sensor request on several sites, and others have reported more - FedEx, Lowes, Kayo Sports, Hotels.com, Anthem, Pizza Hut... to name a few. Why would sites as varied as those need access to a gyroscope or accelerometer? Like all modern development, websites are built upon layers and layers of libraries. Are they using the same one? Is some library several layers deep requesting access to an API it doesn't need? I think I've figured it out, but if you find something to the contrary, do share. 🧐 An obfuscated file, from Akamai All the pages I've checked out have a reference to an obfuscated file that, when removed, makes the motion sensor icon go away. The name is a 112 bit random value that offers no clues, but differs for each site, so it probably doubles as a unique identifier or account id. Lowe's: c45ff2fedf18894428b6eae366abf1 FedEx: b6c65804238fde1fae4a597ae052 Anthem: c3ce05c96199f8c080a174ece11ff ... and so on. A look at the markup for the page shows it loads the script right before the end of the page, and it looks nearly identical in all cases. Lowe's var _cf = _cf || []; _cf.push(['_setFsp', true]); _cf.push(['_setBm', true]); _cf.push(['_setAu', '/resources/c45ff2fedf18894428b6eae366abf1']);Copy FedEx var _cf = _cf || []; _cf.push(['_setFsp', true]); _cf.push(['_setBm', true]); _cf.push(['_setAu', '/assets/b6c65804238fde1fae4a597ae052']);Copy Anthem var _cf = _cf || []; _cf.push(['_setFsp', true]); _cf.push(['_setBm', true]); _cf.push(['_setAu', '/public/c3ce05c96199f8c080a174ece11ff']);Copy Hotels.comvar _cf = _cf || []; _cf.push(['_setFsp', true]); _cf.push(['_setBm', true]); _cf.push(['_setAu', '/assets/0997d10d16655fda9826ab5d88ea']);Copy Kayo Sports var _cf = _cf || []; _cf.push(['_setFsp', true]); _cf.push(['_setBm', true]); _cf.push(['_setAu', '/assets/662c194b202d4b929be8d06c3195']);Copy Since 4 of the 5 sites included a call to a URL with \"akam/11/pixel\" in it immediately prior, I assume it's related.. possibly some kind of tracking pixel (one of the reasons your email provider blocks images by default). A search of akam/11/pixel (short for Akamai?) turns up loads of other sites that all cause the sensor icon to display too. Deobfuscating it leads to code that suggests Akamai The randomly named js file is always the same, but obfuscated. I was able to deobfuscate it a bit with an online tool and then further by scripting a search and replace with that _ac array that has 711 elements in it, but that only gets a person so far. Figuring out what this does would be a huge challenge (the reason for obfuscating a file in the first place), but searching for bits and pieces of code turned up a couple threads suggesting it's the Akamai bot detection service. The values in the _ac array might have some clues in it, and some of the entries sound suspicious. There's loads of references to various plugins, and no shortage of references to sensors (gyroscope, magnetometer, accelerometer and accelerationIncludingGravity, ambient-light-sensor, rotationRate, deviceorientation and DeviceOrientationEvent, DeviceMotionEvent, and sensor_data), and other odd stuff (startTracking and requestWakeLock).var _ac = [\"aj_indx_tact\", \"bind\", \"driver\", \"doe_cnt\", \"mousedown\", \"Batang\", \"clientHeight\", \"emit\", \"indexOf\", \"enReadDocUrl\", \"Palatino\", \"fpValstr\", \"onpointerup\", \"\\\"\", \"dm_en\", \"/get_params\", \"rVal\", \"return/*@cc_on!@*/!1\", \"-1,2,-94,-70,\", \"http://\", \"storage\", \"\", \"onkeypress\", \"navigator\", \"mn_update_challenge_details\", \"keydown\", \"spawn\", \"bm-telemetry\", \"y1\", \"-1,2,-94,-121,\", \"mediaDevices\", \"fillText\", \"mn_ct\", \"requestWakeLock\", \"Noto\", \"=\", \"//\", \"rotationRate\", \"call\", \"mn_mc_lmt\", \"toLowerCase\", \"uar\", \"Palatino-Bold\", \"arc\", \"-1,2,-94,-120,\", \"td\", \"unk\", \"z\", \"devicemotion\", \"gf\", \"push\", \":\", \"TI-Nspire\", \"Edge PDF Viewer\", \"dme_cnt_lmt\", \"prototype\", \"hpu\", \"hku\", \"hkd\", \"mn_ts\", \"mn_tout\", \"Version/4.0\", \"non:\", \"sensor_data\", \"display\", \"getFloatVal\", \"sort\", \"ambient-light-sensor\", \"number\", \"~\", \"WebKit-integrierte PDF\", \"RTCPeerConnection\", \"0a46G5m17Vrp4o4c\", \"now\", \"value\", \"iPad;\", \"map\", \"GET\", \"mme_cnt\", \"msHidden\", \"vc\", \"||\", \"-1,2,-94,-124,\", \"-1\", \"x12:\", \"hf\", \"pstate\", \"callPhantom\", \"sd_debug\", \"RealPlayer Version Plugin\", \"lastIndexOf\", \"hpd\", \"floor\", \"XDomainRequest\", \"mn_lc\", \"clipboard-write\", \"pme_cnt\", \"vc_cnt_lmt\", \"AlNile\", \"shiftKey\", \"runFonts\", \"isIgn\", \"fpVal\", \"\", \"dme_vel\", \"which\", \"hmu\", \"dmact\", \"==\", \"-1,2,-94,-119,\", \"aj_lmt_doact\", \"do_en\", \"appMinorVersion\", \"Mac OS X 10_5\", \"clearCache\", \"font\", \"getStorageUpdates\", \"Basic \", \"x11:\", \"onblur\", \"monospace\", \"outerWidth\", \"htm\", \"Damascus\", \",s3:\", \"isTrusted\", \"cookie_chk_read\", \"ff\", \"TouchEvent\", \"Bell MT\", \"altKey\", \"0\", \"-1,2,-94,-115,\", \"mozRTCPeerConnection\", \"pd\", \"tme_cnt\", \"hypot\", \"imul\", \"dis\", \"mn_il\", \"sf4\", \"hmm\", \"Google Earth Plug-in\", \"pact\", \"doe_cnt_lmt\", \"vibrate\", \"start_ts\", \"offsetHeight\", \"localStorage\", \"deviceorientation\", \"onmouseup\", \"join\", \"round\", \"height\", \"documentElement\", \"mozAlarms\", \"ceil\", \"Unity Player\", \"Java Plug-in 2 for NPAPI Browsers\", \"sc:\", \"doact\", \"Century Gothic\", \"geolocation\", \"none\", \"Birch Std\", \"enGetLoc\", \"mousemove\", \"tme_cnt_lmt\", \"6pt Arial\", \"toDataURL\", \"keyup\", \",cpen:\", \"canvas\", \"Droid Serif\", \"tduce_cnt_lmt\", \"pluginInfo\", \"XMLHttpRequest\", \"name\", \"webkitHidden\", \"url\", \"mn_abck\", \"touchend\", \"afSbep8yjnZUjq3aL010jO15Sawj2VZfdYK8uY90uxq\", \"-1,2,-94,-109,\", \"#f60\", \"fromCharCode\", \"stroke\", \"Futura\", \"fpcf\", \"style\", \"bpd\", \"ver\", \"abs\", \"cc\", \"rgb(120, 186, 176)\", \"pe_cnt\", \"timezoneOffsetKey\", \"documentMode\", \"createElement\", \"webdriver\", \"Default Browser Helper\", \"nav_perm\", \"x\", \",0\", \"undefined\", \"Minion Pro\", \"getTimezoneOffset\", \"webstore\", \"mact\", \"Shockwave Flash\", \"aj_lmt_dmact\", \"-\", \",loc:\", \"storeWebWideTrackingException\", \"-1,2,-94,-117,\", \"Corsiva Hebrew\", \"doa_throttle\", \"rCFP\", \"hmd\", \"accelerationIncludingGravity\", \"message\", \"bd\", \"}\", \"hasIndexedDB\", \"permissions\", \"gd\", \"language\", \"asin\", \"pe_vel\", \"fontSize\", \"serviceWorker\", \"removeChild\", \"hvc\", \"cma\", \"sessionStorage\", \"apid.cformanalytics.com/api/v1/attempt\", \"magnetometer\", \"apicall_bm\", \"XPathResult\", \"sed\", \"default_session\", \";

view raw motion_sensor_file_obfuscated2.js hosted with ❤ by GitHub Any requests to use those sensors, or even a check to see if a device supports them, would probably cause the sensor icon to show like it does, just like in the sensor examples I wrote up at the top of this post. The next 30 lines after that one have some possibly-interesting stuff too. A version number, some counters, a URL for some kind of analytics, an api key, and something (maybe a flag?) called sensor_data that's set to 0. var _cf = _cf || [], bmak = bmak || { ver: 1.54, ke_cnt_lmt: 150, mme_cnt_lmt: 100, mduce_cnt_lmt: 75, pme_cnt_lmt: 25, pduce_cnt_lmt: 25, tme_cnt_lmt: 25, tduce_cnt_lmt: 25, doe_cnt_lmt: 10, dme_cnt_lmt: 10, vc_cnt_lmt: 100, doa_throttle: 0, dma_throttle: 0, session_id: default_session, js_post: !1, loc: , cf_url: (https: === document[location][protocol] ? https:// : http://) + apid.cformanalytics.com/api/v1/attempt, params_url: (https: === document[location][protocol] ? https:// : http://) + document[location][hostname] + /get_params, auth: , api_public_key: afSbep8yjnZUjq3aL010jO15Sawj2VZfdYK8uY90uxq, aj_lmt_doact: 1, aj_lmt_dmact: 1, aj_lmt_tact: 1, ce_js_post: 0, init_time: 0, informinfo: , prevfid: -1, fidcnt: 0, sensor_data: 0, Copy One function in the mess of code stood out. It seems to be hitting tons of permissions and sensors to see if the browser prompts you for each one, or simply grants or denies them without prompting. You can see from my example code near the top of this post that prompting a user for access is enough to show the icon, and that seems to be what this is doing. np: function () { var a = [], t = [geolocation, notifications, push, midi, camera, microphone, speaker, device-info, background-sync, bluetooth, persistent-storage, ambient-light-sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, clipboard, accessibility-events, clipboard-read, clipboard-write, payment-handler]; try { if (!navigator[permissions]) return 6; var e = function (t, e) { return navigator[permissions][query]({ name: t })[then](function (t) { switch (t[state]) { case prompt: a[e] = 1; break; case granted: a[e] = 2; break; case denied: a[e] = 0; break; default: a[e] = 5 } })[catch](function (t) { a[e] = -1 !== t[message][indexOf](is not a valid enum value of type PermissionName) ? 4 : 3 }) }, n = t[map](function (a, t) { return e(a, t) }); Promise[all](n)[then](function () { bmak[nav_perm] = a[join]() }) } catch (a) { return 7 } }, Copy A reference to cformanalytics.com, registered to Akamai A quick whois on cformanalytics.com from the cf_url key above suggests it belongs to Akamai... they just keep coming up.

I'm not sure why a bot detection service would need to check sensors, but maybe it's just one signal in a myriad of signals to detect if a requestor is a human or a bot? Or maybe it's being used as part of fingerprinting to track and individually identify visitors? I spent a little time digging around the Akamai site, and while most of their documentation is locked behind having an actual account, I stumbled on this regarding their mobile device capabilities: The Akamai Bot Manager Premier software development kit (BMP SDK) takes the fundamental technology of Akamai Bot Manager and applies it to native mobile apps. The BMP SDK collects behavioral data while the user is interacting with the application. This behavioral data, also known as sensor data, includes the device characteristics, device orientation, accelerometer data, touch events, etc. Akamai BMP SDK provides a simple API to detect bot activities and defend against malicious bot and account takeover. It includes this graphic, which just seems to reinforce the above description, that their bot detection service(s) uses sensor data like accelerometer capabilities to determine whether a requestor is a bot or not. source: Bot Manager Premier SDK I feel fairly confident that's the answer, but it leaves at least one more question... But why do they expect desktops to have an accelerometer? I think maybe it's an oversight, but I can't really prove it. Akamai has every incentive to keep their presence hidden. From how well they seem to have obfuscated their files, I think they'd agree. Since I can't prove anything, I'll try to make some educated guesses. Guess 1: Their script doesn't handle responsive websites correctly Most websites are responsive, meaning they use CSS to adjust dynamically for desktop devices with large screens, tablets with medium screens, and mobile devices with tiny screens. So unless Akamai detects the screen size and loads a different obfuscated file for each (and what about mobile users that choose the \"view desktop site\" option, or tablets with a very high resolution?), odds are the same script that runs on mobile devices is running on desktops. Guess 2: They provide two scripts, but companies only implement one Or perhaps their Akamai Bot Manager Premier SDK service that builds on the basic \"Akamai Bot Manager\" service is only meant to be loaded on mobile versions of sites, leaving the onus of implementation to individual sites. I can imagine most businesses, upon hearing that they have to implement two libraries, and then realizing that one is just a more enhanced version of the other, instructing the development team to just reference the \"premier\" SDK everywhere. If anyone hears differently or knows more, please share in the comments. I've been updating this periodically over the last 6 months. I think there's a lot of inquiring minds who'd love to know more!

(2019) (grantwinney.com) 158 points by joecobb 22 hours ago| hidepastfavorite167 comments trustingtrust 21 hours agoA while back I stumbled upon google chromes privacy settings and found things like serial port on your computer to be accessed by websites. Turns out google has thrown everything in the mix because they probably want their &#x27;Chromebook&#x27; users like children in school to use motion sensors for convertibles to maybe play games via a browser. Websites are just taking advantage of these things. The chrome browser has ruined the internet. reply xyzelement 21 hours agoparentThe browser is essentially the operating system for most computing today so access to peripherals is reasonable.My current job uses USB security keys and I assumed I&#x27;d have to configure them in the OS before the browser was aware of them -nope! Chrome knows if the key is in the USB port and can interact with it with my approval, which is exactly right.The leap from access to USB to access to serial is minimal. As long as the right permission checks are in place. reply criddell 21 hours agorootparent> The browser is essentially the operating system for most computing todayYou&#x27;re right, and it&#x27;s such a bummer. I often think about how interesting it would be if we didn&#x27;t end up with the Chrome&#x2F;Safari browser duopoly and Windows&#x2F;macOS duopoly on the desktop and Android&#x2F;iOS duopoly for mobile. How cool would it be to see what the Amiga, Atari ST, Spectrum, OS&#x2F;2, BeOS, etc... could have become with another couple of decades development. Even Windows and macOS would probably be different if they had to compete in a healthy, diverse ecosystem.Instead, further concentration is probably going to happen once Apple allows alternate browsers.

It sucks.Making an app means:Android (and Android TV being more work), iOS, web, Roku, Fire TV, Tizen, Vizio, WebOS (LG), and multiple set top box vendors who all have horrible underpowered CPUs.Some companies try do to cross platform, and that sort of works, but it is janky and customer complain of the sorts of UX issues that always pop up with cross platform apps, and for any decent functionality you end up writing per-platform shims. Also some platforms (Roku) you have to write an app for anyway because the platform requires using a custom language. Other platforms (Set top boxes) are so underpowered that you can&#x27;t really run anything resembling modern code on them.It sucks. It is a huge waste of engineering effort for no real gain. Most customers don&#x27;t choose a smart TV based on its OS, a large % of people choose based on what is on sale at Costco, and another demographic chooses whatever they are told is \"the best\" by reviewers.Mobile app developers dealing with a duopoly have it easy, but even that dramatically increases barrier to entry compared to the 90s where you just had to write one app for Windows and so long as you only used documented APIs, Microsoft would move heaven and earth to make sure your app kept working between major OS updates. reply dylan604 19 hours agorootparentprev>How cool would it be to see what the Amiga, Atari ST, Spectrum, OS&#x2F;2, BeOS, etc..But all of these systems did exist.

Here’s what the actual spec says :> This specification was published by the Web Platform Incubator Community Group. It is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track.It’s an experimental spec by Google (observe the affiliation of the three editors: all Google); Mozilla has adopted a negative position on it ; WebKit has not remarked upon it. reply lxgr 21 hours agorootparentprevTo my knowledge, no browser allows any usage of WebUSB without a prompt.WebAuthN is different, since it does not provide sites low-level peripheral access – WebAuthN and CTAP have been designed for specifically this environment and go to great lengths to make fingerprinting hard.As long as you don’t actually use an authenticator on a site to store a credential, it won’t be able learn anything about it. reply repelsteeltje 20 hours agorootparentNot sure about this, but I think from JavaScript you can absolutely probe stuff without explicit user consent. For instance, without accessing any USB device I can try: if(!navigator.usb) { console.log(\"learned that browser does not have USB capability\"); } else { console.log(\"learned that browser has USB capability\"); navigator.usb.getDevices().then((devices) => { devices.forEach((device) => { console.log(device.productName); console.log(device.manufacturerName); }); }); }(Which is useful for fingerprinting.) reply nolist_policy 19 hours agorootparentOkay, so you can learn that Chrome supports WebUSB and Firefox doesn&#x27;t.

But now you have additional telemetry to show that this wasn&#x27;t cURL forging a Chrome (or Firefox) user-agent header.Finger printing sounds sophisticated, but it&#x27;s just collecting the bits and pieces into something that (mostly, probabilistically) identifies you. And then tracking you, surveilling you till you&#x27;re somewhere where they can identify you.From there: profit! reply lxgr 18 hours agorootparent> this wasn&#x27;t cURL forging a Chrome (or Firefox) user-agent header.There must be a million different ways to establish that, though.I get the general idea, but this particular data point seems highly correlated with just the family of browser, as GP suggests.It&#x27;s also very easy to fix – just make your non-WebUSB-supporting browser expose that object, but always behave as if the user had declined that particular prompt. reply repelsteeltje 18 hours agorootparentThat still allows website to distinguish between webUSB-aware clients and older browsers. The point being, that it would be great if extentions like WebUSB were developed such that nothing about capabilities could be learned without the users&#x27; awareness and explicit consent.Unfortunately, instead, new capabilities are added to browsers constantly and the interfaces commonly are silently made available as part of a regular software upgrade. Sure, thought is given to security and the user is prompted just before something horrible is about to happen (access camera, mic).But don&#x27;t underestimate the shitload of \"niceties\" in the grabbag of APIs that in aggregate reveal more or less a supercookie of your browser instance. reply pipo234 18 hours agorootparentYes, enumerating available capabilities helps fingerprinting. And this is not good, and APIs should be designed better.But there are easier avenues that are harder to mitigate. Hashing an image that relies on the browsers rendering of (default) fonts. Highly instance specific, lots of entropy. reply lxgr 17 hours agorootparentprev> more or less a supercookie of your browser instance.That&#x27;s really not what it is though, is it?These capabilities will be rolled out for all users of a given browser, or even for a given rendering engine, and I&#x27;d assume that your browser family is already easily fingerprintable. In other words, they are all highly correlated.Things like installed fonts, window sizes, your clock drift etc. are a different story. These lower-correlation measurable properties are the real supercookie problem. reply hedora 17 hours agorootparentIt lets you enumerate all the USB crap on the bus.My desktop has 12 things on the bus. 8 are soldered on to the motherboard, and 4 are plugged in.

That&#x27;s all entwined with legal maneuverings in courtrooms.

I figured it was fingerprinting or some other nonsense. reply mcbrienollie 21 hours agoprevIf the website contains a protection system such as Cloudflare, Perimeter X or similar, they run a small software in your browser called Challenge (which you might seen in Cloudflare also). This software is trying to understand if you are a bot or not by executing a series of internal functions on the browser which is also called Fingerprinting. They usually go hard on microphone, motion sensors, camera, location, navigator (language etc), WebGL and other similar technologies. Bots usually does not contain these functions.

Every w3c specification that adds features to the platform adds more unique data that can be used to identify you. They try to add security to the sandbox to make sure the user has to give permission to the website to use these APIs but it&#x27;s always a cat-and-mouse game to make sure that there are no ways to break out of the sandbox and to educate users about what all these modals and features mean.Websites are getting obnoxious these days.

    "originBody": "Online Courses Certificates Degrees & Mini-Degrees Audio Books Movies Podcasts K-12 eBooks Languages Donate Noam Chomsky Explains Why Nobody Is Really a Moral Relativist, Even Michel Foucault in PhilosophySeptember 28th, 2023 1 Comment Facebook Twitter Reddit Noam Chomsky made his name as a linguist, which is easy to forget amid the wide range of subjects he has addressed, and continues to address, in his long career as a public intellectual. But on a deeper level, his commentary on politics, society, media, and a host of other broad fields sounds not unlike a natural outgrowth of his specialized linguistic theories. Throughout the past five or six decades, he’s occasionally made the connection explicit, or nearly so, by drawing analogies between language and other domains of human activity. Take the panel-discussion clip above, in which Chomsky faces the question of why he doesn’t accept the notion of cultural relativism, which holds moral norms as not absolute but created wholly within particular cultural contexts. “There are no skeptics,” Chomsky says. “You can discuss it in a philosophy seminar, but no human being can, in fact, be a skeptic. They wouldn’t survive for two minutes if they were. I think pretty much the same is true of moral relativism. There are no moral relativists: there are people who profess it, you can discuss it abstractly, but it doesn’t exist in ordinary life.” He identifies “a tendency to move from the uncontroversial concept of moral relativism” — that, say, certain cultures at certain times hold certain moral values, and other cultures at other times hold other ones — “to a concept that is, in fact, incoherent, and that is to say that moral values can range indefinitely,” tethered to no objective basis. If morality is transmitted through culture, “how does a person acquire his or her culture? You don’t get it by taking a pill. You acquire your culture by observing a rather limited number of behaviors and actions, and from those, constructing, somehow, in your mind, the set of attitudes and beliefs that constitutes culture.” He draws a natural comparison between this process and that of language acquisition, which also depends on “having a rich built-in array of constraints that allow the leap from scattered data to whatever it is that you acquire. That’s virtually logic.” And so, “even if you’re the most extreme cultural relativist, you are presupposing universal moral values. Those can be discovered.” When he spoke of “the most extreme cultural relativist,” he was thinking of Michel Foucault? Back in 1971, Chomsky engaged the French philosopher of power in a debate, broadcast on Dutch television, about human nature and the origin of morality. There he practically lead with linguistics: a child learning to talk starts “with the knowledge that he’s hearing a human language of a very narrow and explicit type that permits a very small range of variation.” This “highly organized and very restrictive schematism” allows him to “make the huge leap from scattered and degenerate data to highly organized knowledge.” This mechanism “is one fundamental constituent of human nature,” in not just language but “other domains of human intelligence and other domains of human cognition and even behavior” as well. Perhaps we do have the freedom to speak, think, and act however we wish — but that very freedom, if Chomsky is correct, emerges only within strict, absolute, wholly un-relative natural boundaries.

However, when the foundation of ethics is based on feel, then there are serious problems, because it stands to reason that folks who have a different feel are entirely justified in their ethical standards (assuming good-faith and good reasoning).At that point, we have the problem that almost every ethical theory (I would argue the concept of ethics), must be universalizable. That is, if something is wrong for me, it should be wrong for someone else in my position (not necessarily everyone). This is completely impossible when ethics are ultimately based on feel.Now, Chompsky here is basically saying, come on, we have innate instinctual ethical views. I generally agree with him, but it ultimately doesn&#x27;t matter. If ethical theory is simply instinctual, the same meta-ethical problem exists, it&#x27;s just that the founding axiom that most folks will have is that the \"normal\" ethical view is the \"correct\" view... it&#x27;s a fine axiom, we needn&#x27;t argue about it, but it&#x27;s still arbitrary, and effectively amounts to might makes right. reply Molotokoto 0 minutes agoparentThere are few thought experiments which would force you to a &#x27;better&#x27; behaviour.You don&#x27;t know for example, if death is real or not (deah not real -> afterlife) which could bring up a few scenarios like you currently are supervised if you are &#x27;good&#x27; enough.Or the old idea of hell vs sky.The best bet for you is always to be &#x27;good&#x27; weird thing is people don&#x27;t get it. The same issue with people getting asked if we should increase taxes for the rich people and they say no because they think they are affected by this.Or a sentence someone once said: Don&#x27;t teach kids playing footbal to win, teach them to play so that others want to play with them. reply simonh 13 hours agoparentprevHe’s not saying we have instinctual ethical views. He’s saying we have a biologically determined interpretive framework we use to evaluate ethical questions.This is what he was talking about when he said we make a leap from scattered data to specific conclusions, and we all do this in a similar way. We all just have different data. However when we have very similar data, such as living in a particular culture, we mostly come to the same conclusions. The interpretive framework sets that reference frame for human ethics.The comparison to visual systems is apt. Intelligent spiders would have a different biologically determined ethical interpretive framework in the same way that they would have a different visual system.Within the range set by our biology there is a considerable degree of arbitrariness, for sure. He spells this out clearly at the beginning. He’s not arguing there is no relativism. He’s arguing against the absolute unlimited relativism espoused by Foucault because that’s what he was asked about. reply Liminal_Ledge 3 hours agorootparentThe concept of a &#x27;biologically determined interpretive framework&#x27; doesn&#x27;t seem all that determined to me. The variation in our individual moral compasses and the existence of intercultural moral divides indicate that this framework is as vague and inconsistent as it can be.Using empathy or feelings as a basis raises the question of whose sensitivity we should calibrate it on. We are not moral relativists because the concept of morality itself is built on the idea of distinguishing right from wrong. We believe that what we are doing is right.In the future, there might be a carbon-neutral vegan society, and they will view us through their newly derived ethical compass, much like how we perceive morality when we look back at our recent history.If this biological source had any consistency, why did people do monstrous things while believing they are on the right? Would you have had your current moral compass if you lived in another society&#x2F;another time that you look back at now with horror? Can you find a single human ethic that all societies from any time can agree on? reply johnnyjeans 9 hours agorootparentprevinstinctual -> biologically determinedviews -> interpretive framework&#x2F;evaluation system reply SV_BubbleTime 10 hours agorootparentprev>He’s not saying we have instinctual ethical views.

We have done OK at that so as a society, we keep doing it that way.Sure, ok, that’s “relative”, but also obvious and doesn’t invalidate the idea that we know which things are good&#x2F;ethical beyond how they feel. reply bambax 11 hours agorootparentprev> when we have very similar data, such as living in a particular culture, we mostly come to the same conclusionsThat&#x27;s not my take from the interview, but in any case this is provably false. People living in a given \"culture\" don&#x27;t come to the same conclusions: they come to different conclusions -- usually opposite ones.Politics wouldn&#x27;t exist otherwise. Or most wars, which are almost always between neighbors sharing more or less the same \"culture\" but having values so different they&#x27;re willing to die to defend them. reply noobermin 10 hours agorootparentHow about \"similar enough?\" People, particular people who&#x27;ve never lived in another culture overemphasize differences within their own culture between themselves and others in their own culture. They often overestimate similarities between themselves and other cultures. reply wubrr 11 hours agorootparentprevI mean if you recursively generate &#x27;opposite&#x27; conclusions you still only end up with 2 different conclusions? reply simonh 9 hours agorootparentprevI didn’t say the same, I said mostly the same.Cultures consist of a consensus. When the consensus shifts, the culture shifts. Politics operates within an agreed framework at any given time.At the time of the founding of the USA some people had misgivings about slave owning, but even some of them still owned slaves. 100 years later there was a civil war over it. Today in the US slavery is almost universally maligned and only exists as a covert criminal activity.Was there a diversity of opinion at the time of the revolutionary war, and is there now? Sure. Was there a consensus then and now? I don’t see how you can argue otherwise. reply bambax 3 hours agorootparentAt the time of the civil war there was no country-wide consensus on the question of slavery, obviously.Today, on that specific question, there seems to be a consensus (although one can argue it&#x27;s largely a legal consensus: the song \"Rich men north of Richmond\" is choke-full of dog whistles advocating for a return to the good old times of pre-civil war in the South, and its runaway success shows it resonates with many people).But there are a lot of other ethical topics where there is zero consensus, in the US, today. Guns, abortion, immigration, to name a few. reply ekabod 10 hours agorootparentprevIf we consider that a person is a data point with its own properties (family, wealth, education, upbringing environment,...); the idea of a universal framework that handles these properties for ethics is still valid. reply alphazard 13 hours agoparentprevAxioms are only arbitrary in terms of the logical system they are involved in. If they conflict with other axioms, one of them has to go. So the choice of axioms isn&#x27;t totally arbitrary, even at the level of logic.When it&#x27;s time to take an idealized theory and use it to make predictions about the real world, we first have to check that the axioms match our sense data. If they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not an applicable theory. That removes another degree of arbitrariness when putting any theory into practice.\"Feeling\" good or bad is the bedrock of morality. From the vantage point of the human mind, our entire experience is colored with judgement. e.g. This is net good, that is net bad, etc. There are interesting questions to ask about how that evolved, or why it presents itself in consciousness, but it is first and foremost just a fact about the human experience.That isn&#x27;t arbitrary. A human cannot will their experience to stop containing judgements.So yes, many people have come up with many theories about morality, ethics, and meta-ethics, but we can and should discard any of them that don&#x27;t have their axioms satisfied by ground truth. reply afwef 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re assuming a logical system, but these \"axioms\" aren&#x27;t like math, trying to find a contradiction is itself a moral judgement.So you&#x27;re just arguing in circles. None of the grounding in reality is actually connected to moral judgements in the sense of proving them wrong or right. reply x86x87 10 hours agorootparentI would say math has the same problem. Math is based on a bunch of axioms.Here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;G%C3%B6del%27s_incompletenes... reply noobermin 10 hours agorootparentprev>Axioms are only arbitrary in terms of the logical system they are involved in. If they conflict with other axioms, one of them has to go. So the choice of axioms isn&#x27;t totally arbitrary, even at the level of logic.We aren&#x27;t logic systems, and neither are systems of ethics. People change their minds and are self-contradictory. Things vary from time to time. Kantian style ethics are a rareity and are almost a caricature people critique to make a point or argument in parable. reply OkayPhysicist 12 hours agoparentprevFar from being completely impossible, subjective ethics are entirely more consistent than the alternative. The important thing about analyzing ethical systems is to find axioms that you actually believe. An unanalyzed moral system tends to have false axioms: things that the speaker says are fundamental tenets, but on further analysis simply don&#x27;t stand muster.For example, the Commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\" is anything but an axiom. All but the most unreasonable followers will be able to produce some circumstance where killing is moral. That&#x27;s not an axiom, that&#x27;s a guideline.So why find one&#x27;s axioms? Ultimately, the entire study of ethics boils down to one simple question: \"What ought I do?\". When faced with a dilemma, what should I choose? With the understanding of your beliefs, you can make a reasoned decision, consistent with your broader choices. If you exist in a society, then you will inevitably be forced to react to the actions of others, which, in of itself, is a forced action on your part. If you don&#x27;t have some framework with which to judge the actions of others, then your ethical framework is utterly incomplete. reply mensetmanusman 9 hours agorootparentIt’s actually better translated ‘though shall not murder’ for the modern reader. reply JumpCrisscross 9 hours agorootparent> better translated ‘though shall not murder’ for the modern readerWhich cleverly punts the problem to the language centre of the brain, which gets to decide whether a particular killing was a good kill (execution, enemy combatant) or bad (murder). reply mensetmanusman 8 hours agorootparentIt does for a reader, but reading wasn’t common ~4K years ago when it was written. These are communal truths verified through generations of dialog and discussion. reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparent> does for a reader, but reading wasn’t common ~4K years ago when it was writtenThe point is murder is defined as bad killing. That doesn’t help us define what “bad” means. (Or whether a particular killing is bad.) It leaves it to context.

Still edge cases, but the holes are much smaller. reply mensetmanusman 9 hours agorootparentDoesn’t work on the context of mental illness. reply mcpackieh 8 hours agorootparentIt breaks down when dealing with anybody who selfishly wants more than they deserve. A child stamps his feet and demands the biggest piece of cake, should you give it to him? Treating people the way they want to be treated rewards greed and selfishness.On the other hand, treating other people the way you wish to be treated is self-moderating. If I am greedy, the golden rule commands me to be generous to others. If I encounter somebody who&#x27;s greedy, the golden rule only obliges me to give them whatever I would think myself entitled to.The golden rule can&#x27;t make everybody happy, and isn&#x27;t supposed to. If there is some delta between the way your grandparents expect to be treated and the way you want to be treated, so be it. I don&#x27;t think this is a reasonable objection to the golden rule. reply PaulDavisThe1st 5 hours agorootparentI think you meant to reply to my comment, rather than a comment on that.When it comes to materialistic \"treating\", sure I agree. But in the realm of emotion and psychology, I stand by what I said: treats others as they wish to be treated (to the extent possible). replyDaveExeter 9 hours agorootparentprev\"Thou shalt not kill\" is a mistranslation.The commandment is \"Thou shalt not murder\". reply eynsham 14 hours agoparentprevI think you’re confusing epistemic problems for metaphysical problems. It’s quite plausible that any axioms we come up with are merely ‘based on feel&#x27;, but there can be a truth ‘based on feel’ ultimately inaccessible to us except ‘[by] feel’. That inaccessibility does not make the underlying truth arbitrary; it merely makes our attempts to work it out arbitrary. reply Liminal_Ledge 3 hours agorootparentThere is no truth coming from \"feel\". Our brain chemicals are designed in a way that suits evolution best, not to mention that there is absolutely no consistence in these feelings on an individual level (to a smaller degree) and on the the temporal and cultural level.What you are saying assumes that brain chemical reactions have an ability to hint at some sort of truth. The idea itself sounds closer in nature to religious arguments. And I think if this was indicating a truth of some sorts, the differences morals doesnt sell this idea to me personally. reply bluGill 13 hours agoparentprevTo put out two examples: Abortion and Guns are very hot topics where people with otherwise similar ethics some on the opposite side and refuse to understand how anyone could take the other position because whichever side they are on is so obviously correct.Please think about the above next time topics like those come up. Once you take a moment to understand the different axioms someone puts higher in priority the better you can understand what is going on. And that there is no universal means you cannot call the someone who takes a different stance things like stupid, unreasonable or wrong (they might be - but not in relation to this topic). Maybe the world will learn to get along a little better if more people will try to understand each other.

But it is still not the case that \"all of our ethical theories are based on arbitrary axioms\". That is no more true than that the weather is \"based on arbitrary axioms\". replyfsckboy 8 hours agoparentprev> axioms are by definition arbitrarysorry, the axioms of Euclidean Geometry are not arbitrary. They are axioms by the definition of axioms, but not by the definition of arbitrary. reply scoofy 7 hours agorootparentI’m a bit overwhelmed with the pushback on this point. The fact that axioms are, again, by definition arbitrary, should be anything but controversial.The axioms of Euclidean geometry are very obviously arbitrary, in that, we can create other forms of geometries should we choose to. The fact that we are attempting, with Euclidean geometry, to create a model of the phenomena we experience is good and useful, but that does not change the fact that we could create a geometry of any other fashion, to map to any other phenomena we could imagine.If we found that all minds feel the same with regard to an ethical mapping we created (I see this as Chomsky’s point) then we have effectively created a physics of ethics. The problem is that it is quite obvious that this is not the world we live in. In fact, if it were, I would hardly think we would have much disagreement about anything of moral substance.Thus, we are living in a world where two people measure the same geometric line, and find two different results, form two different axioms to model their measurements, and then try to enforce their measurements with threats of violence.Again, I consider myself a fairly ethical person, I have an moral theory, I just don’t pretend that my theory can be universalizable, and don’t think that moral judgments, in a philosophical sense, have much foundation. The reason I fight for what I fight for is that I feel that doing what we can to help each other is the way we should live. I just know there are plenty of people who will inherently disagree, and there is little way to reason with them.I’m not a moral relativist in that sense, I just refuse to pretend that I can create an ethical theory in any moral sense beyond what makes good sense to me. reply fsckboy 6 hours agorootparenta million monkeys on typewriters typing arbitrarily will ultimately type out every known work of literature.

It underlies many ethical and legal frameworks, including principles related to human rights, the value of individual lives, and the importance of protecting life.An axiom, in this context, is a fundamental and self-evident belief or principle that serves as a basis for other beliefs and actions within a particular culture or belief system. reply Natsu 14 hours agoparentprevSome axioms are more useful than others, though. For example, Peano axioms can be used to formalize parts of math which we use to make models of physics which enable engineering that makes all sorts of technology. Many others can&#x27;t get to that point. reply xenocratus 13 hours agorootparentSure, but usefulness is itself an arbitrary criterium. reply Natsu 12 hours agorootparentOnly in the weakest sense where one can emit other noises from their mouth instead. That criteria is an outgrowth from our drive to fulfill our own material needs, without which one does not do philosophy or anything else, which in turn are dictated by the natural world we live in. And none of that is something where you can just plug in so many other ideas or axioms and get a similar result.Those and similar axioms were used to develop science & technology that provides our ability to even have this conversation.

He looks at morality like language. It&#x27;s just that normal does indeed have an apparently wide range, which according to his theory is actually quite limited. I like this idea. Similar to the limits of reason itself; from one perspective the human condition limits us to a frustratingly small territory of what is thinkable at all. Morality is narrow because humans are alike. This is a claim about the human condition itself, not about the moral majority.The only real exception i can think of is psychopaths, but I think that they do live up to their name. reply firecall 11 hours agoparentprevFor further reading, see Kant’s Categorical Imperative. reply nmz 13 hours agoparentprevWhatever raises survivability and QOL is ethical.

It it better to have a child suffer, an adult, or an old man? Two people suffering less vs. one people more? Future people vs. current people?

But to assert that the morals don&#x27;t come from God is not to say that morals are not valuable or worth having.As Foucault puts it, \"What is good, is something that comes through innovation. The good does not exist, like that, in an atemporal sky, with people who would be like the Astrologers of the Good, whose job is to determine what is the favorable nature of the stars.

We humans surely share and exhibit some similar social behavior. That truth doesn&#x27;t determine exactly how a culture will conceptualize and enforce a sense of morality. But it does mean some theoretical moral systems just won&#x27;t work in practice. E.g., history hasn&#x27;t left us with examples of well-fed kings with no king&#x27;s guards during famines.So if you&#x27;re a radical whose theories rely on humans asblank slates on which infinite moral systems may be applied (after the revolution, probably), you&#x27;re going to have a bad time in the real world.Digression: I have no idea how this truism fits in with Chomsky&#x27;s political ideas about anarcho-syndicalism. reply lsy 14 hours agorootparentBut what you are saying is just that the “range” of morality is handed down by nature. And the idea that this range is “naturally” limited is too often used, as it is in your comment, to make an argument from nature’s authority in favor of certain applications of power that may or may not be good for people. What I think relativism does is restore accountability to the individual and the society for moral decisions, rather than appealing to natural or theological authorities to absolve people and institutions of responsibility for their choices. reply jancsika 13 hours agorootparent> But what you are saying is just that the “range” of morality is handed down by nature.Yes, but for the generous interpretation of what I wrote.E.g., you can&#x27;t build a moral system that requires cordoning children off in individual stalls (one child per stall, no direct contact with other humans), feeds and virtually teaches them the rules of the society, then when they reach the age of 18 and pass a test get released into the wild to socialize with other humans for the first time. What we know about child development tells us that this system will be an utter failure.If you can imagine accepting at least some version of that paragraph as supported by the scientific evidence for how humans socialize, then you agree there are some hard limits on what kind of moral systems humans can thrive under.If you don&#x27;t accept there are any limits whatsoever, then you fall into self-contradiction and incoherence which AFAICT is all Chomsky is pointing out.Edit: clarification.

In what way is moral relativism a logical contradiction? \"...even if you’re the most extreme cultural relativist, you are presupposing universal moral values. Those can be discovered.”That&#x27;s not true at all. I don&#x27;t presuppose universal moral values. And if I do, they can still be compatible with a relativistic description. (e.g. I can say they&#x27;re relative to my current understanding, or relative to our collective shared understanding).And as a linguist, he himself should know best that language usage here matters.

This constrains the scope of relative claims, as you pointed out, but also implies an actual truth or set of standards with which you can evaluate anything.It&#x27;s not clear what universal moral values looks like, like Epicurean pleasure&#x2F;pain or maybe it stems from thermodynamics, or even just mathematics itself, but it is possible that it could be discovered. reply fluoridation 15 hours agorootparent>If you assert that &#x27;moral relativism is true&#x27; that itself would be a relative claimWould it?

Is that sentence itself a moral statement? Why? To me it reads like a statement about reality, not about what is moral or immoral.>It&#x27;s not clear what universal moral values looks likeUniversal moral values are not the same as absolute moral values, though. For example, let&#x27;s suppose that \"murder is wrong\" is a universal moral value. That just tells you that every human agrees on that, but we&#x27;re still working off a subjective, biased system, because every human you could ask will evaluate this moral question using their human brain. And if you could ask every living thing in the universe, you would still have the bias of matter-based life. How could you tell a universal moral value is basic enough that it&#x27;s independent of any subjective point of view? The only truths I can imagine that could meet those requirements would have to be really abstract, like 1+1=2 as you say. reply speak_plainly 14 hours agorootparentSo for the first point about &#x27;moral relativism is true&#x27; yes it&#x27;s a meta-ethical statement, but at the same time, logically, you&#x27;re affirming the set &#x27;moral relativism&#x27;.And the second point, I would argue that &#x27;universal moral values&#x27; arise from &#x27;absolute moral values&#x27;, whatever that might be, if it&#x27;s even possible to know it.I also don&#x27;t think that moral relativism is a logical negation of moral absolutism, more like an opposing view. reply fluoridation 14 hours agorootparentBut my point is that the existence of universal moral values do not prove the existence of absolute moral values, because universal moral values can also arise in the absence of absolute moral values (or it would have to be demonstrated that they can&#x27;t).

This is actually pretty clearly the case for programming languages -- primitives like addition&#x2F;subtraction, methods, objects, etc. -- are chosen by language developers in different doses, and we group languages together based on these grammatical syntax choices (e.g. functional family of languages, declarative&#x2F;imperative languages).It sounds like Chomsky is claiming morals work the same way; there are a finite set of things that humans find reprehensible or good.

But perhaps the arguments from contemporary abolitionists were secretly eating away at him from the inside, inspiring a real sense of guilt. I think that is congruent with the theory that some small kernel of universal morality exists in all humans capable of feeling empathy, derived from that innate empathy instinct. People can be conditioned to ignore it, and this explains much of the variability in human morality across cultures. A slave owner can ignore that part of his mind that empathizes with the slaves because ignoring it is socially and financially convenient. Some can be needled and prodded into acknowledging it, while many go their entire lives with this empathy buried and ignored. But however ignored, that kernel of universal morality still exists in them. It&#x27;s universal to humans because we&#x27;re all the same species of social ape evolved to have instincts which facilitate social cooperation, particularly empathy. This morality is universal in the sense that all humans have the theoretical ability to access it within themselves, but actually doing so obviously isn&#x27;t universal.(Actual psychopaths, if such people even exist, may be the exception. If they truly lack the ability to empathize they would be unable to tap into this otherwise universal morality. Furthermore, the empathy instinct is not as perfect as might be wished; in almost all people empathy is felt more strongly for people who are close (socially and geographically.) Less empathy is felt for people who are distant or \"other\". Innate empathy has limits, and therefore universal morality is woefully flawed and incomplete.) reply pixl97 11 hours agorootparentHeh, yea, trying to use the internal feeling of guilt as a basis is a path to complete failure in my eyes.This overlaps with the quest for AI we have and Chinese Room arguments.

Humanity does not behave perfectly morally, so if that&#x27;s your expectation then we&#x27;ve failed and always will fail. But most people do have the capacity to behave morally most of the time, and people are guided in this primarily by their internal sense of right and wrong (informed by their innate social instincts.) This system doesn&#x27;t work perfectly but it&#x27;s very far from a complete failure. replythrow310822 21 hours agoparentprevSeems very close to his argument about the innateness of language structures. I can rephrase your question replacing moral* with language:> Chomsky seems to be saying that since we learn the prevalent language of our culture through sparse data there must be an underlying universal language structure.

But now we see that they don’t do it because a single instance isn’t enough data for them. They don’t venture to use a new construction till they’ve heard it many times and know how to use it.> A nice confirmation of this: children learning inflectional languages don’t learn the six person&#x2F;number combinations at the same rate. They first master the ones with the highest frequency in adult speech– e.g. 1st person singular, rather than 3rd person plural. Again, they’re learning by imitation, and it takes a huge amount of repetition for them to learn something. They also seem to learn each verb paradigm separately– it takes a long time before they start generalizing. reply roenxi 22 hours agoparentprevPossibly the article is poorly written?

In culture A, the tradition is that at solstice you should wear red shirts. Suppose they&#x27;re not extreme about it, but they may look at you concerned or disappointed that you&#x27;re not respecting their tradition for wearing a red shirt on that day. In culture B, the tradition is to wear a blue shirt instead.If you go to culture B (from culture A), and wear a red shirt at the day, people will find it strange and be disappointed.Does that mean one of those cultures is right in an absolute sense, and the other is wrong? I think at least in a \"good enough\" sense, maybe not. I think in many cases it comes down to non-unique solutions -- more than one culture can be good. Either case may be fine.However, I think we can with progress in philosophy, science, etc.. critique cultures as a whole: we can try to define what is good. Not only that, but I think in the sense of what is good, then yes: I think we should converge on common, more or less universal principles. Within the same principles, a universe of cultures can exist; furthermore, variety itself is arguably part of goodness. If everything is the same, then we might be missing out in serious ways, both in immediately practical terms of different viewpoints fostering new innovations (if everyone thinks exactly the same... everyone has mostly the same ideas), and also in a cultural, aesthetic sense of life being more interesting with more than one &#x27;cultural way&#x27;, so to speak. Yet cultures should mostly agree on common universal principles (at least in some &#x27;assymptotic&#x27;, aspirational sense -- principles should be agreed more and more, and disagreements ought to become more minor).You may observe &#x27;Ok, but those principles are just the product of the culture you started with!&#x27;. I think that&#x27;s somewhat fair. But I think universal principles are kind of &#x27;natural&#x27; in a certain sense -- I think there is a unique set of principles that is capable of unifying concepts like science, truth, morality, sustainability, art, culture -- as far as reason can go. If you look at mathematics, it is universally agreed whether a statement should be true or not. And we don&#x27;t expect a different culture to find it differently. It&#x27;s really surprising, I think, that reason should be able to tell anything about culture, but, although it&#x27;s in some senses extremely difficult (specially if you&#x27;re thinking of proving anything practical&#x2F;concrete, like whether an art piece is beautiful or not), those things should all be accessible to reason. This is in no small part because the processes that happen in our own minds can be studied -- and the study of mental processes is in the end what can provide a great unification of all sciences and arts (although in practice like I said it&#x27;s too difficult in the near term). We can understand the nature of happiness, unhappiness, beauty, motivation, and so on, in a very solid way, in the same way we can study the behaviors of particles, control systems, processors, materials, knots, and so on (there are some important details to this study that are too long for this discussion[1]).(I think both Chomsky and Focault would probably agree on this point eventually)That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t have cultures that refuse all that, potentially until they &#x27;die&#x27;. It&#x27;s also not to say you couldn&#x27;t have some weird culture that does mathematics in a different way and they try to persistently live with grave inconsistencies. This would make their mathematics fragile, and probably far less useful -- the point where we call it &#x27;totally unreasonable, pointless&#x27;. But it doesn&#x27;t seem impossible that they could be totally unreasonable. This seems to undermine the notion of universality. If universality doesn&#x27;t mean all cultures share the values, not even that all cultures would converge or even agree on those values, what could it mean? I think universality only means (in the context of ethics) that a culture with a sufficient set of tools&#x2F;principles, procedures and systems do eventually converge on common principles. It&#x27;s basically a basin of attraction of principles (and practices), that needs a minimal set for bootstrapping.So what is this minimal set? And critically, do we even have it?I think it can be summarized as consistency, or truth. By requiring that language be logically consistent, and enforcing the notion of truth (across reason[2], individual and collective decision-making), plus of course being sentient beings ourselves (that allow us to recognize and understand truths related to sentience, which I think are at the root of all that matters[3]), we get science, we become able to talk with each other reasonably, we become able to agree, we become able to investigate, etc.. By demanding that ethical principles have some (and eventually rigorous) consistency, we can get to moral truths: if my (literal) brother and my neighbors are both human beings, why should I only help my brother and not my neighbor? How am I fundamentally different from others that I should be more important? (egotism), etc.. What makes it hard, fundamentally, is that sometimes those demands come into conflict with our instincts, or even major aspects of our society, so we can dangerously veer off this path.I think we have it, and another name for it might be Enlightenment, both in the sense of western culture, and eastern cultures (e.g. in buddhism). Are we enlightened yet? :)(I would say we&#x27;re mostly on the path to enlightenment, although we haven&#x27;t yet been able to discover and agree on some principles and truths that are very important to our lives -- we are on the path but still far from the ideals)This is such a beautiful and important notion to me, I think it might be worth it to call this God (i.e. this enlightenement, this path to truth&#x2F;science&#x2F;everything that is good that can be known) -- with capital G, and why not worship and protect this notion.[1] The difference is that you need sentient beings and our experiences of ourselves to be able to understand truths about sentience. In a way we are, and have to be, both subject and scientist, and this is a little different from strict views of science.[2] I&#x27;ve talked so much about reason&#x2F;truth that I think I should mention intuition too. Intuition is the practical means of thought. Intuition can be thought as large leaps of logic that may be uncertain and&#x2F;or non-trivial. Most of our language statements don&#x27;t actually follow from one another immediately in the sense of logic, instead they tend to jump many steps at once, or we even make propositions that are unproven (in mathematics we tend to use intuitive leaps to find proofs and then fill in the gaps with formal statements). Many things in life are actually not so important that we need to prove an ideal solution, usually good enough is enough. Still, this process and language itself relies on the infrastructure of logic, truth and consistency to work; and in many cases, involving important decisions, we can reduce uncertainty and improve decisions by refining our steps, and giving more solid arguments (approaching truth with greater confidence).[3] Just to be clear, I&#x27;m far from proposing we become naive logical machines. Those would probably be both ineffective, and neglect taking into account the experience of being itself. Even fantasy is important in this sense, but I think we should be careful to keep fantasy separate from reality as much as reasonable (phenomena like &#x27;Santa Claus&#x27; and psychological quirks notwithstanding). Fantasy is good and reasonable in a way! Same goes for things like arts, games, sports, leisure. Should be made from self-sustainable good feelings. reply the_gastropod 22 hours agoparentprev> He identifies “a tendency to move from the uncontroversial concept of moral relativism” — that, say, certain cultures at certain times hold certain moral values, and other cultures at other times hold other ones — “to a concept that is, in fact, incoherent, and that is to say that moral values can range indefinitely,” tethered to no objective basis.The existence of a tether is what he’s focused on here, it seems to me. reply empath75 21 hours agoparentprevI think he&#x27;s making two slightly related points.1) That while it&#x27;s possible to talk about moral relativism in the abstract, nobody in their own life is a complete moral relativist, which is to say that they will have _some_ moral system that they live their life by, even if they completely recognize the arbitrariness of it.2) Moral systems have large degrees of freedom, but they _are_ constrained, and he thinks some of those constraints might be innate. For example, while all forms of violence can be approved of in some society, it&#x27;s always _conditional_. You could _imagine_ a moral system where arbitrary extreme violence against anyone and anything including yourself and your family would be perfectly moral, but you won&#x27;t see that in any real society. There are always some conditions under which violence is acceptable. reply HerculePoirot 21 hours agoprevThe main question of the second essay is the ethnocentrism often criticized in my anthropological perspective. Those who protest against \"Western ethnocentrism\" willingly imagine that they owe nothing to the West since they vehemently attack it. In reality, their perspective is the most Western that has ever existed, more typically Western than that of their opponents.The revolt against ethnocentrism is an invention of the West, nonexistent elsewhere. Its first great literary success is the famous essay by Montaigne on \"The Cannibals,\" which is already over four hundred years old. The author&#x27;s anti-Western rhetoric, not always in good faith, is the starting point of a long war against only one ethnocentrism, of course, that of the West itself. This endeavor produces its most beautiful masterpieces in the 18th century and resurfaces, more virulent than ever, after the Second World War.What characterizes the most recent phase is the abandonment of the elegance and humor of the great ancestors, in favor of very 20th-century neologisms, such as the word \"ethnocentrism\" itself. The rococo trinkets of the Enlightenment era are covered with a slightly thick veneer. Where Montesquieu said, \"How can one be Persian?\" our contemporaries roar \"against Western ethnocentrism.\" The essence of the debate has hardly changed.\"This debate is, moreover, legitimate. Western culture is ethnocentric too, it is obvious, as ethnocentric as all the others and in a more brutally effective way, of course, because of its power. It is not a matter of denying this, but why not also recognize an irrefutable historical evidence at the same time? Unlike all other cultures, which have always been straightforwardly and unapologetically ethnocentric, we Westerners are always simultaneously ourselves and our own enemy. We are the supreme Majesty and the opposition to His Majesty. We condemn what we are, or believe to be, with often ineffective fervor, but at least we try. What is happening today is another example of the passion for self-criticism, which only exists among beings touched by Judeo-Christian civilization.\"Excerpt from \"The One by Whom Scandal Comes\" by René Girard reply olddustytrail 15 hours agoparentThat doesn&#x27;t sound like Irish culture at all.

Half a million years of living as bands of Hunter gatherers. But these values are not completely consistent. For example, we think that stealing from others is wrong, but we also think that not sharing is wrong. These are rules of thumb that evolved in Hunter gatherer societies.So we have inconsistent values, and which values are most preeminent differ depending on what society we are in.On top of this are sex roles and sexual morality that were developed because of the needs of agricultural societies, which were very different than what was needed to survive as Hunter gatherers.So there are a wide variety of moralities that individuals can settle on as they try to make sense of all these contradictory impulses. reply MisterBastahrd 14 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t believe morals have much to do with an inheritance of values, mostly because mankind, from civilization to civilization, has largely kept the same set of basic morality regardless of where they are or what religion they possess.Sure, some things change, but theft, murder, lying, etc... they&#x27;re pretty universally seen as wrong. And in the instances where they AREN&#x27;T seen as inherently wrong, it&#x27;s usually a class-based stance that still sets them apart.

Very profitable also; most people don&#x27;t understand that plants have a big economical value just as raw materials. But is not this case; nobody tried to remove the wood.Revenge is a fact. Some protected very old oaks had been killed in Spain after tourism to see them became too invasive. Probably not the same with the sycamore, but it could be a team of badly advised locals, for sure.The fact is that there is a global pattern in Europe and USA of manipulating rednecks and gullible people against nature.

From a parent? Or from an employer?When it comes to employers, City and Guilds NPTC and Lantra chainsaw courses are only offered to people at the Minimum School Leaving Age and above. Since employers are not permitted under HSE regulations to let untrained people operate chainsaws, and since the training is not instant, this effectively bars 16-year-olds from getting chainsaws from their employers. reply HenryBemis 18 hours agorootparentprevI will go ahead and assume that in the middle of nowhere and with no cameras in sight, the authorities may have used any available data (i.e. cell tower antennas information, social media tracking your phone&#x27;s location 24&#x2F;7, and so on).Chainsaws like that cannot be handled by a random 16 boy, unless he is the son of Hulk or Thor. Perhaps the kid texted to a friend \"we cut the treeeeee\" or similar.. I would be VERY surprised to finally see proven that a 16yo did this.Side note: I have used a chainsaw numerous times in my late teens cutting down branches for a fireplace. I could never manage to cut the tree trunk pieces, even on a chopped down tree. Branches (20cm diameter or less) were easy peasy. But a 60? 70cm diameter? Nah... reply lamontcg 17 hours agorootparentYou were some kinda scrawny 16 year old kid.Most of the problem is dealing with the physics of keeping the chainsaw from binding which requires experience (or dumb luck) more than strength. reply ballenf 17 hours agorootparentExactly, an average 12-14yo of modest strength could maneuver the chainsaw. The hard part about that work is doing it safely when unexpected things happen. reply mnw21cam 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ll counter that - I&#x27;m of fairly slight build, and I have cut down multiple trees in my garden with my chainsaw, easily 50cm diameter. It&#x27;s not that much of a stretch to imagine cutting down something a little bigger. Chainsaws aren&#x27;t that heavy. reply bombcar 20 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s an exceptionally clean tree-felling, though the position of the hinge indicates it was meant to fall toward the wall.The paint looks like an indication on how big to make the hinge, which actually suggests someone who \"knows what they&#x27;re supposed to be doing\" but not \"used to doing it all the time\". reply RobotToaster 18 hours agorootparentSo potentially, \"someone who just watched a youtube video on how to fell a tree\"? reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what I would suspect. Someone who did enough research but hadn&#x27;t really done it before.But! It also looks pretty clean for a \"first try\" so maybe the paint is something else. reply mytailorisrich 1 hour agorootparentI have felled a couple of old apple trees in my garden with a chainsaw after watching a \"few Youtube videos\".The trunks were maybe 30 to 40cm in diameter so obviously much smaller trees than that sycamore (well apple trees for a start and much younger) and I can tell you that this is one of those things that looks easy when you watch but not so much when you do it. Handling a chainsaw to be able to make clean, straight cut through takes practice and you need a good chainsaw as well.So IMHO there is no chance in hell that the sycamore was felled by an amateur.I believe that one has to be at least 16 to become a trainee so maybe that 16 year old has received previous training and&#x2F;or his family works in the field.

It is alongside the wall but does not date to its construction, or anywhere near.It is several hundred years old, which is certainly remarkable though far from unique. It seems to be known primarily for being picturesque, which is less about the tree itself and more for being located in an interesting gap in the hills. It shows up in a number of movies, and as far as I can tell, its being really famous only dates to the 1990s.I don&#x27;t mean to diminish this. It was a much-beloved icon destroyed in senseless cruelty. I was just trying to put it into context for myself.

Because it generated a lot of outrage (not from regular patrons, but from people who liked how it looked), it got more attention than your average arson where the owners were obvious suspects, and sure enough there have been actual arrests as well as rumours about other fires involving the same owners and evidence of demolition equipment having been leased the day before the fire reply AlecSchueler 19 hours agorootparentRumours and arrests are one thing and not uncommon in any case, but has anyone been charged with a crime? reply notahacker 18 hours agorootparentRumours about organizations behind the incident are normally in local pubs rather than national newspapers though.

Proving it in a courtroom is another thing, but it sounds to me like more resource than would usually be thrown at investigating a fire in an empty building. reply AlecSchueler 17 hours agorootparentRumours in the pub and rumours in the paper are no different in the court of law. Has any evidence been brought forward and has anyone been charged with a crime? reply notahacker 16 hours agorootparentRumours in the national press are a lot more influential in allocating police resources to finding evidence and interviewing suspects than rumours in the local pub.Not really sure why you&#x27;re continuing to insist on a Sherlock Holmes style resolution where everyone&#x27;s been charged and all evidence is in the public domain within the first couple of months, but what is evident is that it hasn&#x27;t been abandoned like it often would have been by now. reply AlecSchueler 16 hours agorootparentYou said that \"Court admissible evidence is more likely to turn up when it&#x27;s front page news and people are digging\" and then used this as an example. I&#x27;m asking because it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be an example of what you&#x27;re claiming. reply notahacker 11 hours agorootparentI used it as a topical example of another ongoing case where court admissible evidence was more likely to turn up because the police are more motivated to look for it and people with possibly relevant information more likely to testify, yes.

We would need a material with some flexibility probablyConnecting vases is the easy part as long as is done fast, or the cut piece is covered and protected from became too dry and develop longitudinal cracks.First, all leaves and some branches must be removed to avoid fast dehydration. Both surfaces have to be polished to 1) assure a good contact (the chainsaw removes a few centimeter ring of the wood, so you can just put it in place and wait) and 2) achieve perfectly 180 degrees flat surfaces so all the forces are applied vertically and the trunk remains in the same place instead to slip to the right for example.Then you need to (pressure?) wash the surface to remove any debris and unclog the vases.next step would be to put both trunks in the exact position with a crane (should be easy part. The trunk section is not a regular circle) trying to connect most possible vases even if you don&#x27;t achieve a 100% contact and one side must end very displaced. As long as you can somehow assure that the weight has accurate support, this is all.Survival is not guaranteed. no government has been done this before, but any politician succeeding on this would send a strong message, and probably became very popular overnight.

The proportion of &#x27;living:dead&#x27; material is much more amendable to grafting too. And it tends to be done with budding branches rather than a whole tree, in fact I haven&#x27;t been able to find any reference of someone cutting down a tree and putting it back together, especially one of this size, the structural challenge alone makes it something that I do not think will work, especially not in that location with the tree taking the brunt of the wind load through that gap. reply sp332 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a sycamore tree.

The right question is how much strength or size is necessary to operate a modern powerful chainsaw with a sharp chain. The answer is \"not much\". You need to be able to position a ~15 lb (7 kg) saw at waist height for a few seconds until each of three cuts is started. With a sharp saw, the forces are negligible after that for 2 of the 3 cuts required. With good technique, you can even use leverage against the trunk for the one short upward cut.

Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 engine, was introduced by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google's dominance in the search industry. By offering users an interactive chat-based experience instead of the traditional search query and result format, Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and user-friendly. In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat conversations to generate revenue from this new platform. However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the door to threat actors, who increasingly take out search advertisements to distribute malware. Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to click on ads, which isn't the case when skimming through impersonal search results. This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI assistants. The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk. Imitating a popular IP scanner Malicious ads spotted by Malwarebytes are pretending to be download sites for the popular 'Advanced IP Scanner' utility, which has been previously used by RomCom RAT and Somnia ransomware operators. The researchers found that when you asked Bing Chat how to download Advanced IP Scanner, it would display a link to download it in the chat. However, when you hover over an underlined link in a chat, Bing Chat may show an advertisement first, followed by the legitimate download link. In this case, the sponsored link was a malvertisements pushing malware. The risky URL served in a Bing Chat conversation Source: Malwarebytes The malvertizing campaign was created by someone who hacked into the ad account of a legitimate Australian business to create two malicious ads targeting system admins (IP scanner) and lawyers (MyCase law manager). Malicious ads created by the threat actor Source: Malwarebytes Clicking on the malicious ad for the IP scanner takes users to a website ('mynetfoldersip[.]cfd') that separates bots and crawlers from human victims by checking IP address, timezone, and various system indicators for sandbox/virtual machines. The victims are then redirected to 'advenced-ip-scanner[.]com', a clone of Advanced IP Scanner that uses typosquatting (notice the e in advenced) to trick visitors. The redirect chain (Malwarebytes) The downloaded MSI installer contains three files, one of which is a heavily obfuscated malicious script that connects to an external resource to retrieve the payload. Malicious VBS in the downloaded MSI (Malwarebytes) Unfortunately, Malwarebytes could not find the final payload for this malware campaign, so it is unclear what malware is ultimately being installed. However, in similar campaigns, threat actors commonly distribute information-stealing malware or remote access trojans that allow them to breach other accounts or corporate networks. The display of malvertising within Bing Chat conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot results and always double-check URLs before downloading anything.

I&#x27;m sure the cretins are delighted with Microsoft right now. For the given test question, the first answer in any search engine would have been the official site. reply baobabKoodaa 12 hours agoprevFor the record, Microsoft stole this idea from me, and I implemented it first, although as a parody: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;future.attejuvonen.fi reply liminalsunset 12 hours agoparentIt seems like after it disables non-prerecorded queries, you also stop losing social credits. a query that previously appeared to decrease the credit count no longer does. reply risfriend 6 hours agoparentprevThis is very tastefully done, really like it. reply qingcharles 7 hours agoparentprevThis is really nicely done, thank you :) reply ToucanLoucan 14 hours agoprevI really do not understand the benefits supposedly of this tech over a traditional search engine. All it&#x27;s doing is pulling the top hit from Bing and saying it back to you in a chat format. The AI doesn&#x27;t understand what IP Scanning software is, nor does it understand malware, nor does it understand anything about what you&#x27;re saying, it literally just doesn&#x27;t. It takes what you asked, stuffs it into bing, and reads out the results to you.I understand why people want AI search engines, the problem is, this is not an AI search engine. None of them are to my knowledge. It&#x27;s just an ML bot mediating a search between you and the engine. The web page accomplishes the exact same task, without the unearned air of authority.Like, the IDEA of an AI search engine, an artificial intelligence that knows all this stuff and can weigh in alongside you with insight and comprehension, that&#x27;s incredibly cool. But this is not that. ChatGPT knows much but understands nothing. reply collaborative 13 hours agoparentNeither Google nor MS will ever get AI search right because the only applicable use of AI in a search engine is to remove the seo&#x2F;junk&#x2F;ads&#x2F;clickbait and give the user what he is looking for.

Basically, taking how the AI was fine tuned and turning it into comprehensible disclosures as to how much you can trust it to have your, versus its creator&#x27;s, best interests in \"mind.\"For example, injecting ads and even content moderation to keep ChatGPT from joining Hitler&#x27;s Youth, could both be considered non-fiduciary functions. reply yid 14 hours agoparentprevA lot of the value comes from follow-up questions. Imagine being able to interrogate a StackOverflow answer with new constraints and details. Not always correct, but in some cases, faster that typing in a new search term and parsing a screen full of links. reply ToucanLoucan 14 hours agorootparentBut again, the AI doesn&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s going to search around the internet and probably take a closer look at what it already told you, but that&#x27;s it. It takes a plethora of information and attempts to digest it into knowledge but it lacks the understanding with which to accomplish this task.Unless I guess you train an AI on a given topic, like a few languages or a database or something. But given ChatGPT&#x27;s apparent vulnerability to just making shit up, you&#x27;ll have to call me skeptical if this has any real use. reply empath-nirvana 14 hours agorootparentGPT4 \"knows\" a lot more about most topics than any single human does. People have this idea that it absolutely needs to be perfectly correct at all times to be useful, but would never hold a human being to that standard.How many times have you asked a co-worker about something and they gave you a convincing answer that was totally wrong? Did it make you stop asking co-workers for help? reply falsenapkin 13 hours agorootparentCoworkers answering wrong gets me to stop asking them for help, yes, especially if it&#x27;s confident or they can&#x27;t qualify uncertainty or I know their ratio of Q&A site visits vs 1st party docs visits is abysmal. There are even people I won&#x27;t ask for help because they trust people that I don&#x27;t trust.Conversely, there are people who I will go to for topics that they are not the SME in, maybe their teammate even is, but I trust their ability to do quality research and intelligently interpret that research for case specific nuances. Like I&#x27;ll go to the networking guy to talk about some DB thing because the DB guys are morons and live and die by junk SEO sites but the networking guy can think analytically and find the source of truth documentation and provide excerpts from it. reply TerrifiedMouse 14 hours agorootparentprev> Did it make you stop asking co-workers for help?That specific unreliable coworker who doesn’t properly qualify that they aren’t completely certain … I believe for most people, yes.We tend not to trust bullshitters. reply noAnswer 13 hours agorootparentprev> Did it make you stop asking co-workers for help?One usually stops asking the bullshitter, yes. reply mrguyorama 13 hours agorootparentprev>How many times have you asked a co-worker about something and they gave you a convincing answer that was totally wrong?Never actually. My coworkers have never told me something with confidence that they just made up. If they don&#x27;t know an answer, they may provide hints and directions, but it will be clear they don&#x27;t know. reply ChatGTP 12 hours agorootparentMaybe I just work with good people but I feel the same. Often we will verify things together but I’d say they never they just make things up. reply ToucanLoucan 14 hours agorootparentprevI VERY much more trust a coworker to know things than I do this AI, especially given not just the subject of this thread, but the larger conversation around it. ChatGPT has a reputation already for just spewing out complete nonsense. Didn&#x27;t Bing&#x27;s implementation argue with someone about what freaking year it was not awfully long ago?These chat bots \"know\" a shit ton and a half of stuff in that they are connected to the largest collection of knowledge known to man, the Internet. But \"knowing\" and \"understanding\" are two different things. The various search engines also \"know\" a ton about where to find things online, that doesn&#x27;t mean they know shit about those things. And as we&#x27;re seeing here: without the context to know that when someone wants an IP scanner, they want something good, that won&#x27;t give their computer malware, that&#x27;ll be reasonably priced or even open source, or even what platform, it just gives an answer based on a search.You could just search for ip scanning software and gotten all the information BingGPT shared with the author of the piece.And like, if you wanted to be charitable, you could say \"well the author should&#x27;ve given more information about what they wanted\" but again, that&#x27;s not different from an existing search engine and more crucially: the AI didn&#x27;t ask questions. Didn&#x27;t ask for platform, how much they wanted to spend, if they preferred open source, or even something more general like what they were trying to accomplish. Nada. Just did a search, and reported results. reply TeMPOraL 13 hours agorootparent> Didn&#x27;t Bing&#x27;s implementation argue with someone about what freaking year it was not awfully long ago?I&#x27;m sorry, but that&#x27;s a stellar example of holding an LLM wrong. These models are frozen in time.> But \"knowing\" and \"understanding\" are two different things.Indeed, and that is a big part of misunderstanding. GPT-4 is, on many topics, closer to understanding than knowing (note that neither is a subset of the other). The conceptual patterns are there, even if sometimes are easy to accidentally overpower by the prompt, or by the sequence of tokens already emitted. reply JumpCrisscross 10 hours agorootparentprev> the AI doesn&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s going to search around the internet and probably take a closer look at what it already told you, but that&#x27;s itF&#x2F;k&#x2F;a Putting a thing on the internet for randos to identify and explain. As long as it cites the LLM cites its sources, general questions in the form of \"what is this\" or \"what&#x27;s going on here\" while you point to a page or an image or in a general direction are not well suited for search engines. reply johnmaguire 14 hours agorootparentprevBecause having the AI do it for you is faster than doing it yourself.Not as accurate, but faster.For some people - I am reluctant to say \"for some use cases\" - that&#x27;s very appealing. reply ToucanLoucan 14 hours agorootparentI am dreadfully curious what use cases you&#x27;re envisioning where a fast, bad&#x2F;wrong answer is better for anything than a correct, slower answer.Like hell, if that&#x27;s the standard, I&#x27;ll be ChatGPT. You won&#x27;t need an outrageous graphics card to ask me a question and I&#x27;ll get you an answer right away. It&#x27;ll almost certainly be the wrong answer, and is just an ass-pulled guess, but if that&#x27;s all you want, I&#x27;ll setup a chat website for myself and start taking queries today. Then investors can give me 10 billion dollars. reply yid 14 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s my pet example...feel free to google around yourself on this.Problem: I want an AWS CLI command line that requests a whole bunch of wildcard certificates from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for a TLD.Ostensible solution: the AWS official docs have a small snippet to achieve this, BUT -- the snippet on the official page is inadvisable as it leads to a browser cert warning.So I (skeptically) asked ChatGPT for a command line to achieve what I was trying to do.Try 1: got basically the snippet from the AWS official docs (but with the inadvisable flag set to the _Correct_ value, strangely)Prompt 2: please give me more best practice optionsTry 2: get back a bunch of new CLI options and their meanings. 3 are useful. 1 is hallucinated. 1 is deprecated.Prompt 3: keep going with more optionsTry 3: 2 more useful new options, 2 more options I chose not to useAs a skeptic, the overall experience was much more efficient that googling around or even reading a manpage. I put it all on the fact that context is maintained between questions, so you don&#x27;t have to repeat yourself when asking for clarifications. reply airstrike 13 hours agorootparentthis. in my experience, GPT-4 really shines for groking AWS commands, writing JavaScript code and helping me understand some errors when compiling my terrible Rust code reply nonameiguess 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m kind of surprised this worked. Did you actually use the command you ended up with? I&#x27;m not even surprised because I think ChatGPT can&#x27;t figure this out in principle, but because the data itself is poisoned. The top link on every web search I&#x27;ve ever used to AWS CLI commands is to documentation for v1, but v1 has been deprecated for years and the page usually begins with a statement telling you not to use it. Amazon&#x27;s problem is they never remove old documentation from the web, so 90% of what you find for any given service is no longer correct. reply TeMPOraL 13 hours agorootparent> and the page usually begins with a statement telling you not to use itThis might be a big part of why GP&#x27;s case works. The model (GPT-4) most likely understands the concept of documentation being deprecated, so the more often v1 docs say it, the stronger a semantic link between current and obsolete docs, and the more likely it is for ChatGPT to give you answer based on non-deprecated docs. reply verdagon 14 hours agorootparentprevSometimes, having a quick, inaccurate, but easily-verifiable answer is better. For example, when you&#x27;re trying to remember the name of that one function to call, or ideas on where to travel next month.Also, not super relevant, but in e.g. combat situations one is often better off running now in any direction rather than pondering which direction is absolutely optimal for running from the lion. You&#x27;ll know soon enough whether it was the right direction. There&#x27;s probably a metaphor somewhere in there. reply empath-nirvana 14 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT doesn&#x27;t \"almost certainly\" give you a wrong answer (especially if you&#x27;re not asking it math problems). The reason that it hallucinating sometimes is so bad is that it happens _rarely_. If it happened all the time, you&#x27;d never use it or trust it. It&#x27;s just that it happens _enough_ that it&#x27;s annoying to have to double check everything. reply latexr 1 hour agorootparent> It&#x27;s just that it happens _enough_ that it&#x27;s annoying to have to double check everything.If you “have to double check everything”, what’s the point? Skip the AI and do the check you were going to do anyway. reply Prickle 9 hours agorootparentprevI have an example where I used the Phind model and GPT4 in a mix. The goal was to get multiple iterations of the same code, written in different ways that I could iterate on.I had this really annoying requirement to get multiple incompatible status codes, and output them in a consolidated human legible way.So pretend I am using MSSQL, and I have 3 status code tables.The status code integers are all slightly different. NEW is always 1, but \"Completed\" could be 5, 7 or 21 depending on table.The actual \"text\" is an integer that can be linked to a Text table via the ID and Language name. But, due to the nuances being slightly different, each version can have a different ID. I can&#x27;t just use DISTINCT on the text ids.This is even more true when slight differences like \"Complete\" and \"Completed\" exist.So I need to use UNION, to &#x27;combine&#x27; multiple unrelated status code tables.Then I need to get the language text, and SELECT DISTINCT (or something similar) per language.Then that needs to be outputted as a drop down for the user.Then, I have to use that as a other, separate input for another SQL query.To say \"using fast, slightly inaccurate GPT code\" was faster than doing it by hand would be an understatement.It gave me about 15 iterations, where about 6 sort of worked. Then I figures it out myself from there. reply johnmaguire 14 hours agorootparentprev> I am dreadfully curious what use cases you&#x27;re envisioning where a fast, bad&#x2F;wrong answer is better for anything than a correct, slower answer.>> For some people - I am reluctant to say \"for some use cases\" - that&#x27;s very appealing.You&#x27;re preaching to the choir.However, do keep in mind that even authoritative sources found during your own research may be inaccurate. And for some questions, which answer is \"right\" or \"wrong\" may not be black and white. reply ToucanLoucan 13 hours agorootparent> However, do keep in mind that even authoritative sources found during your own research may be inaccurate. And for some questions, which answer is \"right\" or \"wrong\" may not be black and white.I mean, sure. But again: that&#x27;s just my point restated. What is this doing that a standard search engine does not?Like, I put shit in my phone&#x27;s calendar and set reminders so that I don&#x27;t to think about it anymore. That is a cognitive load (remembering my dentist appointment) that I have now offloaded to technology. And that&#x27;s useful as all hell, which is why my phone&#x27;s calendar is full to the tits of everything one would put in a calendar. Now I don&#x27;t need to think about it. I get messages from my phone when events are coming up, and I get a literal calendar on my screen when I want it, showing me all these things with perfect accuracy.What is BingGPT in this scenario offloading? It&#x27;s just a search engine but slower. It doesn&#x27;t understand what good software is, so it can&#x27;t make value based judgements on which to recommend. It doesn&#x27;t know what reliable sources are, and can&#x27;t evaluate for them, so every bit of information you get back must be treated with a grain of salt. It (probably) doesn&#x27;t even remotely conceive of why you are asking it a thing or what a good answer to that query would look like because it doesn&#x27;t know you, it just knows a massive, incomprehensible amount of averages about a ton of things that might be what you want.And like, that&#x27;s fine, search engines have had these limitations for my entire life. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying, I don&#x27;t understand why this is better. It&#x27;s the same thing as Bing, but slower, and in a chat box. reply johnmaguire 13 hours agorootparent> I mean, sure. But again: that&#x27;s just my point restated. What is this doing that a standard search engine does not?And again, it is quicker than clicking multiple links and can generalize &#x2F; contextualize what it finds, mapping it to the answer you&#x27;re looking for.Have you tried asking one of these tools to write some simple scripts for you? It works decently, actually.If you didn&#x27;t already know how to program, this could save you a TON of time, even if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly on the first try. reply TeMPOraL 13 hours agorootparent> If you didn&#x27;t already know how to program, this could save you a TON of time, even if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly on the first try.Nice thing is, if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly on the first try, you can describe the problem (or paste the whole output, errors included), and get back a fixed version that&#x27;s likely to work this time around. reply CamperBob2 13 hours agorootparentprevI am dreadfully curious what use cases you&#x27;re envisioning where a fast, bad&#x2F;wrong answer is better for anything than a correct, slower answer.Almost anything related to software development. Any answer I get online, whether from Wikipedia or a Github search or a Stack Overflow question or anywhere else, will require careful study and adaptation before I can use it. There will inevitably be things about any given solution that don&#x27;t apply to whatever I&#x27;m doing, or that will be out-and-out wrong. But does that mean I&#x27;d be better off without doing a search at all? Of course not.Same with AI. It can point me in the right direction and save me a lot of trouble, but it can&#x27;t (yet) do my job for me.When it gets 10x better -- and I&#x27;m sure it will -- then that last part can be expected to change. Which is awesome.Meanwhile, Stack Overflow and Wikipedia and Github aren&#x27;t going to get 10x better, ever. Not without cross-pollinating with AI. replyA1kmm 10 hours agoparentprevMost &#x27;traditional&#x27; search engines are likely to already be &#x27;AI&#x27; search engines anyway - there is a good chance you are transforming your query into a vector in a latent space, and searching for documents that are themselves annotated with a vector approximately close to your search vector (so they are already semantic search).The difference is more just what output format they give you the results in - bespoke text, or a set of links most relevant to the query. The extra layer of text2text processing probably doesn&#x27;t add much if the top result already answers your query.What people really want to do though, is to set custom criteria that synthesise data across multiple different sets to draw novel conclusions that aren&#x27;t in any webpage. That is probably very expensive computationally though, hence there still being a need for bespoke sites that semantically index data for certain types of queries. reply callalex 4 hours agoparentprev>All it&#x27;s doing is pulling the top hit from Bing and saying it back to you in a chat format.I totally agree with you, and I will never understand the core concept either.

The way I&#x27;d answer it, today, would be to look it uourp on a map or ask someone near me.The problem is our Gen1 LLMS are all liars. Oops. (Fortunately, so are most kids.) If we can solve the trust issue, where the LLM is able to self evaluate confidence in its answers, it&#x27;s game over for search as a mainstream product. reply fragmede 13 hours agoparentprevWhat would you consider proof of understanding?What question could we ask that would convince you that a hypothetical future system actually understands what it&#x27;s spitting out, regardless of if it were based on current LLM technology or not? reply Barrin92 11 hours agorootparent>What would you consider proof of understanding?In the search engine&#x2F;chatbot context pretty straight forward, having the capacity to automatically correct obviously illogical or non&#x2F;counter factual info.Say I do a historical search and bing or chatgpt hallucinate something that&#x27;s wildly implausible or straight up makes no sense. If it could spot that on its own and say. \"I&#x27;ll consult some credible sources specifically to resolve that, as what I have found doesn&#x27;t check out\" and then comes up with something that&#x27;s congruent, that&#x27;d show understanding.Same with code. Understanding code would imply something like being able to run a code snippet through a debugger, interpret the meaning of the error message, and fixing what&#x27;s broken. Right now these things give you nothing more but a stochastic guess.This is not a philosophical argument about what it \"means\" to understand btw, just real limitations. Right now it is always the user who has to supplement the understanding and coax these systems into fixing any mistake they make. reply fragmede 2 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about historical search but as far as running code, the advanced data analysis will run python code, and you can ask it to iterate until it works. here we have an example where it output an answer, decided it wasn&#x27;t good enough, and then came out with a second answer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;0cec4f44-2245-45fd-b4c6-304e10...Personally, I think we need new words to describe these things. Understanding, thinking, and reasoning don&#x27;t really capture the meat of what it is and isn&#x27;t doing. It&#x27;s very good at a very specific slice of tasks, but it can also get fooled and be shown to be the stochastic parrot that lies beneath. But I spout incomprehensible gibberish when I get drunk, so, honestly, humans do that too. reply fragmede 13 hours agoparentprevIf I already know the name of what I&#x27;m looking for, a traditional search engine is great.

[...] It&#x27;s just an ML bot mediating a search between you and the enginePure semantics. This whole class of \"it&#x27;s not AI, it&#x27;s ML\" argument is incredibly tedious, these arguments rely on implicit special snowflake definitions of AI. Arguments like \"real AI can understand things\" are completely ass-pulled. Who ever said that true understanding, whatever the hell that even means, is a necessary quality of an AI? This isn&#x27;t taught in any university AI course (which teach even ELIZA as an early form of AI), nor is such a meaning implicit in popular culture, so where is it even coming from? reply eichin 12 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a meme in some AI circles that \"once we understand it, it isn&#x27;t AI anymore\" and things like ML, NLP, and most of the Machine Vision field, while they came from AI, have \"escaped\" and are no longer AI because we&#x27;ve actually figured them out. That&#x27;s probably some of what you&#x27;re seeing; it&#x27;s probably also colliding with \"AI is an umbrella over a bunch of technologies, AGI is scifi&#x2F;fantasy\" which is pushing the other way - that one is a little tainted by the whole \"intelligence is uniquely human\" bit of wishful thinking, where the former is expressing the simpler idea that \"I can estimate and ship a product that uses NLP; any estimate about an AI product is a lie\"... reply cyanydeez 8 hours agoparentprevNovelty.Current search is determinative (in theory, Google ad-meddling aside).
