    "originBody": "Navigation: Homepage Yearly archives All tags Inside a 1 dollar radar motion sensor Jun 28, 2024 (Electronics) (Wireless communication and power) I recently got some cheap RCWL-0516 microwave motion sensors, mostly because I was wondering how China managed to make a radar for under a dollar: Click for mirrored back view Getting one working was quite easy, I just connected the VIN pin to 5 volts, GND to ground, and added a 1 uF decoupling capacitor on the 3V3 pin. When someone moves within ~5 meters, the OUT pin goes up to 3 volts for 3 seconds. So it works, but how? First, I found a datasheet for the the large SOIC-16 chip. It turns out the BISS0001 is an infrared motion sensor chip? How does that work? Generally, motion and speed sensing (doppler) radars work by sending out a continuous carrier and mixing the received signal with the transmitted carrier to create a low frequency IF signal. If reflections are coming from a moving object, the received signal will slowly drift in and out of phase with the transmitted signal, creating a beat frequency at just a few hertz. Becuase a motion sensor doesn’t care about the exact speed, all the chip has to do is look for millivolt-level changes: all the hard work is already done. In my module, the IF signal enters the chip on pin 14, but the chip outputs an amplified copy on pin 16, which is much more oscilloscope friendly:1 In the middle of the trace I moved a laptop ~40 centimeters towards the sensor, but the sensor also picked up some slower level shifts on either side from when I reached over to stop the scope. This trace is actually enough to figure out what the frequency the radar is using: While the laptop was moving, there were 8 peaks, meaning that the round trip path length changed by 8 wavelengths. Eight wavelengths over a distance of 80 cm comes out to ~10 cm, not that far from the actual wavelength of 9.4 cm. So where’s all the magic? The entire right side of the board is just the BISS001 acting as an amplifier, comparator and timer. All of the RF stuff happens on the left side of the board using just a handful of components: At first glance, the whole thing is just a single transistor oscillator working at a frequency of 3.18 GHz: The S shaped track on the emitter is a microwave resonator2 and antenna, which is driven by the BJT transistor with feedback from a capacitor formed by the resonator and a parallel copper track. I suspect the ring structure at the back is just to prevent oscillation at other frequencies, many very similar sensors don’t have one, or just use a solid ground plane. The oscillator is also quite unstable, and drifts by several MHz from hand capacitance and biasing drift, which is likely why the module is quite sensitive to power supply noise. But it’s actually 2 oscillators in one, the microwave oscillation is pulsed at around 20 MHz, creating this waveform on the emitter: My scope can’t see 3 GHz, but it’s there everywhere except on the downward slopped part of the waveform. What’s happening is that as the oscillator runs, it changes the 66 pF capacitor, raising the emitter voltage until oscillator can’t run anymore. At this point, the 220 ohm resistor discharges the capacitor, restarting the oscillation in just a few nanoseconds. This pulsing allows it to work as a super-regenerative receiver. Once the transistor’s gain rises above one, the oscillator doesn’t start immediately: It needs a tiny kick to get going. Any signal in the resonator gets amplified again and again until it’s large enough to charge the capacitor and restart the cycle. Because of the exponential increase in amplitude, even a tiny amount of RF will increase the pulse frequency, turning the oscillator into a sensitive receiver. (This is why you never have to wait long for an oscillator to start, noise will quickly be amplified until it clips the transistor amplifier) Well hang on, if it’s receiving while the oscillator starts, before it transmits, how is it able to see the phase change from moving objects? With the off-time of around 15 nanoseconds, any returns from a static object more then 2.5 meters away will arrive during the oscillator’s start-up. These static returns act as the radar’s local oscillator, the super-regenerative receiver detects the amplitude modulated signal from interference between static and moving returns. In an indoors environment with plenty of reflections, there will always be some RF bouncing around to illuminate moving objects, no mater how close they are. This sort of radar-by-wishful-thinking approach is probably why the sensor has very inconsistent performance; Indoors it works very nicely, with up to 5 meters of range, but outdoors with no convenient static returns it often doesn’t work at all. A bit of fun, an S-band transmitter: The first modification I tried was to remove the capacitor that causes the 20 MHz pulsing, which is actually two 33 pF capacitors in parallel: This turns the thing into a transmitter, applying a signal to just about anywhere in the oscillator will frequency modulate it, and the thing can be on/off keyed by cycling power. The radar does still somewhat work without the pulsing and super-regenerative parts, except that the IF signals are much weaker, drastically reducing the sensitivity. What’s happening here is that the the oscillator itself is acting as a mixer, down converting the received signal, but without any gain. Bistatic radar: Ok, so can we use this in a more conventional radar setup? I tried placing another unmodified module acting as the receiver next to the transmitter, which resulted in a much more consistent return signal: Signal from moving a laptop towards and away from the radar. The strange amplitude variations are gone and the return from my relatively slow moving hand is much weaker, as expected from a doppler radar. On the other hand, distant return signals are weaker because the receiver is constantly being blasted by RF from the transmitter. It also functions worse as a motion sensor because it needs significant movement towards or away from it to trigger, unlike normally, where just about anything will trigger it. On the other hand, it works quite nicely as a speed sensor by running an FFT or simply detecting zero crossings on the IF (on pin 14/16 of the chip). The math for this is quite easy, just multiply the wavelength by the beat frequency and divide by 2 for the speed. For example, the highest beat frequency in the scope trace was 15 Hz, so the speed was .7 m/s: 9.4 cm * 15 Hz / 2 = 70 cm/s = .7 m/s If the two modules are separated by 1 to 2 meters or so, the outdoors performance is much better then with just a single module, with the best sensitivity in the area between the two modules. The performance is still not exactly good, but it is a lot better then the otherwise non-existent outdoors performance. The chip actually has several integrated opamps, a window comparitor and RC timer. The gain, sensitivity and timings are all set with external passive components. ↩︎ It’s a microstrip transmission line, 1/4 of a wavelength. The capacitor at the end shorts the RF to ground, reflecting it back towards the transistor. The phase shifts add up to 360° (90° one way, 180° reflection from 66 pF capacitor, 90° back), so it acts as an open circuit at 3.18 GHz, but a short at DC. It will also resonate at odd multiples of 3.18 GHz, the circle structure on the back probably stops these higher frequency oscillations. ↩︎ Previous post: Afternoon project: Observing X-ray fluorescence RSS feed This page is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

Don't worry, this 1$ radar motion sensor can tell you. reply silisili 13 hours agorootparentI think you could go cheaper. A sound detection sensor is a bit cheaper, and it just needs to detect the word 'vegan.' reply tstrimple 12 hours agorootparentStrangely enough I've heard far more people make this \"joke\" than actual vegans speaking up. Even when living in LA. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentThe issue with this joke is that it's 100% confirmation bias. You know that all the vegans tell you they're vegan because you don't know about the ones that didn't. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentThere are people that I discovered were vegans when discussing what to eat. And there are people that loudly announced they'd become vegans without any context. The later group used to be larger, but I don't remember anybody doing that recently. reply LoganDark 8 hours agorootparentprevI think it's also survivorship bias. All the people who tell you they're vegan being vegan does not mean that all the people who are vegan will tell you they're vegan, just like all the people who won the lottery probably having bought lots of tickets does not mean that buying lots of tickets will win you the lottery. reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentThat's what I meant, maybe I used the wrong bias name. reply TeMPOraL 5 hours agorootparentI know this under \"selection bias\", so now we have three contenders. Still, I'm not sure if it's a big factor. You likely know who is vegan in your circles, because veganism is unusual enough to be a good topic for gossip, you can easily see it when sharing a meal with someone, and it's also something you'd like to know when inviting people over, if you want to be a good host. So I think a more relevant estimate would be number of vegans you know vs. how many of them announce their veganism at the earliest opportunity. reply LoganDark 4 hours agorootparentI believe survivorship bias is a specific type of selection bias. reply LoganDark 5 hours agorootparentprevConfirmation bias typically refers to accepting very little evidence or rejecting disproofs. Survivorship bias is the one where you forget to account for the non-survivors of a particular selection criteria. reply NavinF 1 hour agorootparentprev“Practically everyone knows what veganism is, but vegans are actually a very small minority.

I am impressed. The PCB, itself, is a major component. Not only for the patch antennas but also several RF filters, the local oscillator, and the mixer are all largely made from peculiarly-shaped PCB tracks. Apart from the PCB, there are only five “components\" on the board. Five passive components to implement a Doppler radar module. C’mon. You have to be impressed by that! reply metadat 15 hours agoparentprevToo fantastic not to submit: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40834960 reply 037 12 hours agoprevA little tangential, but are these things safe for humans? I have a couple of LD2410 devices and I’d like to use one of them with ESPHome in the bedroom. I did some research and they seem to be very low power and safe, but you know, before sleeping with a radar pointing at us all night long, I’m looking for as much feedback as possible. reply perlgeek 6 hours agoparentNon-ionizing radio waves are generally safe for humans. The only mechanism besides ionization that could harm humans is through the transfer of lots of power into the human body (think soldiers keeping themselves warm by stepping in front of a radar emitter). So let's try to do a ballpark estimate of how much that could matter. I haven't found (from a quick search) any data regarding the transmission power, but the data sheet at https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2AD56HLK-LD2410B-P/6620025.pdf says the average current consumption is 79mA at 5V, which means it uses 0.4W. How much of that is actually transmitted? I'd guess 10%-50% (likely much less, but let's go with this more conservative estimate, from a safety perspective), so now we're in the range of 40mW to 200mW. If you absorb 1/4th of that (again, somewhat conservative estimate; you'll likely also reflect some, and most of it is going to pass you), we're at 10mW to 50mW extra power that is absorbed by your tissue. Again, this is a super high (and thus for our purpose, conservative) estimate. Somebody else in this thread mentioned microwatts being absorbed, which sounds much more plausible. To put this into context, the base level of power that an adult human operates on at rest is about 100W. This is a factor of 500 to 2500 more than the power absorbed from our millimeter wave radar. Unless all the absorption happens by a very specific and sensitive part of the body (like your eyes or so), this should just be background noise. If you want another perspective, you could try to compare it with whatever radiation (both RF and heat) that your phone emits, that you likely carry in your pocket for hours at a time. reply lpcvoid 6 hours agorootparent>soldiers keeping themselves warm by stepping in front of a radar emitter Holy, did people actually do this? A quick search yielded no results. Not sure if thankful or not. reply simondanerd 5 hours agorootparentWorks, it's a weird feeling, speaking from experience. HF antennas can give some respectable burns too. But the effects are debated and not entirely scientific: https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13r6hod/i_keep_being_... reply moffkalast 5 hours agorootparentprevWeren't microwave ovens invented because someone's chocolate melted in their pocket while operating a radio transmitter? Maybe it's just a lady godiva story since it seems weird that the person wouldn't feel overly hot as well, but maybe. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentIt's a well known story, he was doing maintenance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven#Discovery The thing is, you don't need a lot of extra heat to melt a chocolate bar on your pocket. It's perfectly possible that everybody felt hot when working on an active radar, but didn't discuss it or maybe even notice the correlation. reply moffkalast 1 hour agorootparentOh wow it's even known what brand of a bar it was, funny that. > The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave oven was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. They were having a blast I see. reply wyager 3 hours agorootparentprev> The only mechanism besides ionization that could harm humans [is heat] This claim is, IMO, too strong given available evidence. There are many chemical interactions with characteristic energies well below 1eV, or any reasonable threshold for \"ionizing\". Photons can couple with these interactions without ionizing anything. 4GHz range is probably fine, because the per photon energy is a small fraction of a mEv, but even then I would not rule out the possibility of multiple photons coupling to a structure without the imparted energy immediately being dispersed as heat. Any time you have EM with low entropy/etendue, it is always theoretically possible for interactions to occur outside of the thermal regime. reply 05 11 hours agoparentprevSome phones have a SAR of almost 2W/kg, compared to that milliwatts of 10GHz RF are nothing. Not to mention that with standard energy dissipation formula of E~R^(-2) you're getting into microwatts at any practical distance from the antenna. reply t0mas88 11 hours agoparentprevI have these all around the house, but not in the bedrooms. I use weight sensors to detect that someone is in bed and traditional PIR for motion in bedrooms. Probably overly careful, but I didn't want to point a radar at my sleeping kids (and myself) for 12 hours per day. Similar for the WiFi access point upstairs, it's only in the hallway and not at maximum power. reply Avamander 7 hours agorootparent> Probably overly careful, but I didn't want to point a radar at my sleeping kids (and myself) for 12 hours per day. While I understand the sentiment. It's very very unlikely to be dangerous and there are plenty of other environmental dangers. The biggest being the sun. But the most common man-made ones are probably auditory. Like toys and TVs being too loud or high-frequency sounds blasted from speakers in malls or under bridges to avoid \"loitering.\" reply moffkalast 5 hours agorootparentYeah on one hand you have people afraid of wifi and simultaneously sending their kids to play all day outside in UV index 11 without a hat or sunscreen. Things that are \"natural\" being inherently safe and anything technological literally death itself. reply davidwritesbugs 7 hours agorootparentprevLoud toys are definitely dangerous for my children, they make me angry. reply 037 10 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you, especially regarding children and anyone who hasn’t explicitly made this choice, which is why I asked the question. The only thing is, I suspect we get scared by certain words, like “radar” and “microwaves”, and then we might spend all day with our heads next to a Wi-Fi router or a phone constantly downloading files on 4G. For example: maybe the ESP32 transmitting the bed weight exposes us to more danger than the radar sensor (that can also be placed very far from the bed)? Maybe with our smartphones charging on the nightstand too. I’m not a big fan of fear-based, illogical decisions. But, again, I understand perfectly. reply mrcsharp 13 hours agoprevThe LD2410 (B) is another option and it operates over UART. It is a bit more expensive ~$5 but has more configuration options. reply stavros 9 hours agoparentGet the B variant, you can configure it over Bluetooth from your phone. Otherwise it's a huge hassle. That said, it doesn't work very well for me when sitting still 4-5m away, it thinks I've left. reply amelius 8 hours agorootparentThese radars are designed to detect motion, not someone sitting still. reply mianos 8 hours agorootparentWrong, most of these radars are 24Ghz and specifically designed to detect body micro movements. They specifically give both human 'occupancy' and dynamic ranging information. I wrote low level drivers for the ESP32 for all the ones I could buy and have tested all of them. The only one that does not try to give a human occupancy position is the car speed sensor. The ld2450 can track three people at once. https://github.com/mianos/hk-heltec-radar/tree/main/src reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentThis sounds very interesting, how do your drivers work? I'd love to try them out, but there's no documentation. I've made a sensor board with various sensors, I could really use some occupancy detection improvements on the LD2450B. reply mianos 5 hours agorootparentAll the boards provided by HiLink have an on board MCU and offer a serial protocol of some sort. I wrote a finite state machine based decoder for each them from the basic info on some documents,random example code and the textual description of the protocol from the aliexpress page. They are all wrapped in an outer state machine that provides entry and exit triggers. If you can read C++ the code is nothing fancy. I have another more complete project for just the 2450 in another repo for the esp-idf with wifi provisioning and publishes presence to mqtt. I have 3 of these around the house. reply stavros 4 hours agorootparentThat's great, I'll have a look, thank you! reply perlgeek 6 hours agoprevSince the user manual for this sensor mentions security monitoring as a possible application, I'm wondering: is there any simple way to prevent detection from such a mm wave radar? (Assuming for simplicity that we know where it's mounted, and in which direction it's pointing). reply lindboe 5 hours agoparentDepends on the definition of \"simple\", imo. The first thing that comes to mind is research into materials with good (tens of dB), wideband absorption in the mmWave bands. It's an area of active research [1] [2] (just a couple articles from a quick google, so caveat emptor). [1] https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journa...

If you want to roll your own check out what the folks over at ESP home have going on (google esp home mm wave). reply stavros 9 hours agoparentThe actual component costs about $5, if you want to roll your own with an ESP32. reply robertclaus 14 hours agoprevI've played with these all the time! Great to know how they work! reply hippich 7 hours agoprevAlmost not related, but reminded me about recent RC hack I was working on. I have an driveway alarm from mighty mule, which uses 433Mhz radio powered by two AA batteries to communicate signal from the coil sensor detection sitting next to the driveway to the base station in the house using OOK modulation. The stock PCB antenna was not very good at the distance I had it to work with, so I started experimenting with external antenna. I tried loaded antenna (i think it is what it is called - the one with the coil) and straight piece of wire. I quickly realized that formula for 1/4 length is more of a starting point, and a lot depends on actual output components of the RC circuit (I have little to no understanding of how all of that works). I tried to cut slightly different sets of wires trying them next to HackRF/PortaPack showing me signal strength in the real time. Basically was eyeballing how strong and clear OOK bursts are, and how well or noisy they sounds through the built-in speaker... (again, I have no idea what I am doing...) At some point I got tired of cutting wires and soldering them, so I tried to cut slightly longer wire and use thin piece of copper tubing to cover end of the antenna at various depth, hoping to simulate the antenna length changes. But at some point something weird to me happened - when just the tip of the antenna was covered by the tube, signal increased dramatically. I am talking about -55db - -50db to -36db on HackRF at the lowest usable gains settings... I ended up with the antenna length slightly below 173mm ideal antenna length with a about 5mm-10mm \"cap\" made of aluminum foil tape (used for air ducts and such) at the very tip of the antenna. I also closed the other end of this wrap (in my imagination so that the signal does not escape this cap???). The cap itself is electrically disconnected from the antenna, it is just that - a cap. I have no idea why it worked this way. I suspect by adding such a \"cap\" I modified something related to the capacitance or perhaps there is some resonance thing coming to play - no clue. But it became much more reliable at communicating over the distance I have it installed. Perhaps someone who knows about such things, might give me a clue what I was dealing with. Another thing that probably plays a role in this hack - outdoor transmitter is in the plastic box sitting vertically on a pvc pole, with batteries inside the same box. 1/4 straight antenna would not fit into it, but I also did not want to cut a hole at the top of the box to avoid water intrusion, so I pointed it down. But it also means it goes in parallel with the \"USB\" cable that connects to the coil-sensor next to the driveway. While system is not grounded, I suspect this USB cable is somehow became part of the antenna, since the best signal was when the line of sight between the antenna and base station, the usb cable was right behind the antenna. Distance between the antenna and usb cable running inside PVC pole is probably about 20-30mm. reply aeonik 6 hours agoparentI need to see a picture, but fyi some of components of an antenna are \"electrically\" disconnected, but still play a role, wave guides being one example. Also note, if you are just receiving signals you have more freedom to experiment. Antenna tuning matters a lot more when transmitting (especially at larger powers). (Not implying that it doesn't matter with reception) reply hippich 4 hours agorootparentJust to clarify - I changed transmitters antenna. reply farceSpherule 2 hours agoprev [–] You cannot try to rationalize the prices that China charges for goods.

We split this out because it's a pretty heavy set of dependencies, and it's nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time. The sharelatex/sharelatex image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code and services. Use make build-base and make build-community from server-ce/ to build these images. We use the Phusion base-image (which is extended by our base image) to provide us with a VM-like container in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the runit service manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the server-ce/runit folder.

    "commentBody": "Overleaf: An open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor (github.com/overleaf)226 points by kaladin-jasnah 23 hours agohidepastfavorite109 comments tombert 20 hours agoI've known about Overleaf for almost as long as I've used LaTeX and until about two years ago, I didn't really understand the point of it; it's not like LaTeX is hard to install or anything, what's the advantage of a web service? It wasn't until I started doing my PhD work where I realized the Overleaf is useful, because the collaborative tools are extremely handy. LaTeX is very popular in the academic world, and Overleaf allows me to easily work on papers with my advisors (who live in a different continent). It's been great. I do wish they'd add Pandoc support; LaTeX is cool but I find Markdown considerably more pleasant about 95% of the time, so it'd be great if they could let us use that, though I realize this is probably easier said than done. reply Levitating 19 hours agoparent> it's not like LaTeX is hard to install or anything that's debatable > I find Markdown considerably more pleasant You could try https://typst.app/ reply thangalin 16 hours agorootparentWhy not both?

That's a major issue with latex these days. reply shepherdjerred 1 hour agorootparentprevAlternatively you could use Quarto. It's excellent. https://quarto.org/ reply SkiFire13 1 hour agorootparentWhile it has lot of functionality you could use to write articles and stuff, it seems more similar to Markdown than Latex/Typst due to any functionality having to be hardcoded in the compiler. reply natrys 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is tectonic. Downloadable single binary, fetches packages on the fly, hardly gets simpler than that. reply tombert 19 hours agorootparentprevI mean, by \"not that hard\", I guess I meant \"not that hard for me\"; `nix-shell -p texliveFull` or whatever your preferred distro's install command. While that requires a certain level of geekiness, I am pretty sure I could still walk my parents through installing it on Windows and get them using TeXStudio or something, so it's not insurmountable. LaTeX itself sort of inherently requires a willingness to do thing in the initially-less-easy way. That said, yeah a web service is of course much more approachable. If my parents wanted to use LaTeX I would probably just point them to Overleaf. reply jcparkyn 14 hours agorootparentInstalling it is easy, what's harder is making sure all your collaborators have the same packages and versions of everything. reply brnt 3 hours agorootparentAnd the majority uses Windows and have never used a command line... Overleaf new ShareLatex is a godsend when collabing. reply andenacitelli 19 hours agorootparentprevThe installation and first five minutes of any kind of product is hugely make or break. I keep my resume in LaTeX via Overleaf, but probably wouldn’t bother with it if I had to get LaTeX running locally, which has always seemed fairly complex to me (though I’m admittedly no LaTeX has expert and may entirely be wrong). reply porcoda 18 hours agorootparentThis surprises me. On most platforms it’s just a package download and install. On Mac, it’s macTeX. On Linux, it’s whatever your distro calls texlive via the package manager. On windows it’s mikTeX. That’s not exactly complex or requiring any sort of latex expertise. Linux can be the one that requires the most thinking if they don’t have one package that pulls in all of what you need, but I can’t remember it being more than a couple minutes of effort last time I did it on Ubuntu or fedora. reply grepLeigh 14 hours agorootparentThe difficulty is getting multiple collaborators to install and pin the same packages, where everyone might be using a different platform/distro. Example: I might commit a change that compiles perfectly fine with my version of asmath, but it conflicts with the version of asmath in the style guide of some UC Berkeley department/lab. reply mbreese 17 hours agorootparentprevIt requires choices and knowing what to install and if things don’t work, troubleshooting the install can be difficult. For a first time task of “install latex”, it’s not the easiest. Especially for newer users. I e done it half a dozen times and I’m still not quite sure if I’ve done it right on my Mac (right away). reply anta40 16 hours agorootparentOn mac: `brew install texlive` Been using texlive for years (also use it on Windows) reply meling 12 hours agorootparentI wasn’t aware of a brew package; I will definitely check that out. I have always been using the texlive installer for macOS (MacTeX), which is very easy to use. Although the install instructions can be a bit long and important to read when Apple breaks things. https://tug.org/texlive/ reply g15jv2dp 12 hours agorootparentprevEnjoy your 10GB of PDF documentation for packages you'll never use. reply tombert 18 hours agorootparentprevFair enough. I just have a Nix Flake to handle this stuff for me now so I just do `nix build`, but obviously that's getting into territory that is super geeky. reply CJefferson 6 hours agorootparentprevI usually use overleaf because I need collaboration. Getting your parents onto collaborative LaTeX is harder, particularly because the continual recompiling of PDFs tends to upset things like OneDrive and Dropbox if two people are editing and syncing at once. reply MatthiasPortzel 18 hours agorootparentprevI tried to \"install LaTeX\" on Mac. I installed latex2html with Brew, and passed it an example .tex. I got `Fatal (syswait): exec \" ./images.tex\" failed: Permission denied` I tried to install `texlive` (at your recommendation) also through brew, and got the error `Could not symlink bin/afm2tfm.Target /usr/local/bin/afm2tfm already exists.` Overleaf just works. reply tombert 17 hours agorootparentI think you should use what you like and if you like Overleaf then by all means use it. That being said, I think the package you want is macTex, installable via `brew install --cask mactex`. As stated in the previous post, it's also pretty easy to get it working with Nix, even on macOS (which is my primary OS until T2 Linux becomes actually usable). reply ModernMech 18 hours agorootparentprevYou answered your own question then: the reason for overleaf is that not everyone finds installing latex easy. reply bgoated01 18 hours agoparentprevThankfully my PhD advisor is fine with just using Git for collaboration on papers. The collaboration features of git (change tracking, commit messages, etc.) are super convenient since I'm already using them for code. (Doesn't apply so much with overleaf git integration since the commits are not human generated.) And no need to have internet access whenever you work on it. reply kyawzazaw 45 minutes agorootparentWhat field? reply wenc 19 hours agoparentprevIt's the Google Docs of LaTeX. It's not strictly necessary (a shared Dropbox folder works for collaboration too), but it's a nice quality of life improvement. Analogous to Dropbox vs Rsync. Sure you can use rsync, but Dropbox is just much easier. reply dr_kiszonka 18 hours agorootparentIf Overleaf was closer to Google Docs, it would be an amazing product. I don't get why its team stopped developing, e.g., collaboration features (like mentioning others in comments and coloring changes by their author) and didn't integrate it with reference managers (Overleaf seems to only support BibTex references). It feels they stopped 10% shy of making Overleaf appealing to folks traditionally less comfortable with LaTeX (psychology, medicine, literature, etc.). I'd love to get my non-technical collaborators on Overleaf but they will not use it until Overleaf gets much polish. reply semi-extrinsic 12 hours agorootparentOverleaf syncs quite well with Zotero. The only bummer is that it's not continuous but one person has to be \"responsible\" for the sync, but usually that works out fine. reply nextos 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's a shame it's not as decent as Google Docs in terms of collaboration. Google Docs lacks some bibliographic management to be a complete solution, an area where Word 365 is also a mess. It's surprisingly hard to find a complete collaboration setup that also works for non-technical users. When working on my own, AUCTeX + git are great. reply KeplerBoy 19 hours agorootparentprevWith the notable difference that there is no magic ingredient to Overleaf. If you have all the files you can recreate the documents with a local latex installation. Overleaf makes this easy, since you can sync it with github repos. Good luck accessing/recreating a google docs document if google has an unexpected downtime or gets shut down eventually. reply DelightOne 19 hours agorootparentOr sync it with Dropbox. Just drop newly-rendered tables into the images folder and bam! you can directly reference them in your latex. reply franga2000 5 hours agoparentprev> it's not like LaTeX is hard to install or anything It took me the better part of a day to set up all the dependencies to properly compile the thesis template my uni provides. Just the core and basic extensions are over a gigabyte to download, then I had to manually copy something from one folder to another, then run some obscure command to rebuild...something, then the version of biber didn't match the version of something else, but if I installer biber directly then it didn't match some other perl library, but I couldn't uninstall and replace that because it was required by some other perl program I have installed... reply setopt 19 hours agoparentprevThe best feature of Overleaf is that you can `git clone` projects and work on them locally (if you have premium). That way, you yourself can use e.g. Emacs to edit, your collaborators can use Overleaf in a browser if they wish, and it all syncs nicely. reply gradstudent 19 hours agorootparentSounds great in principle. In practice, it's the stuff of nightmares. This is because the web version commits every keystroke of your online contributors, making it very difficult for you to actually merge your local commits (they need to stop typing!). reply ramenbytes 18 hours agorootparentYup. When I was using it, I don't think it was literally every keystroke but it was something pretty granular so that if your contributors were working on the document it was a nightmare to get anything pushed since it kept changing under your feet and causing conflicts. Finish a merge, and another one is waiting. reply ccppurcell 10 hours agorootparentI was just about to comment something like: worked fine for me... But then I realised that the only time I did this I was 6+ timezones away from my collaborators. reply setopt 9 hours agorootparentprevI actually never experienced this issue, that sounds annoying. But most papers I work on have like 2 coauthors, where one of them is usually in a different time zone, so that might be why :) reply milliams 8 hours agorootparentprevIn my recent experience, it only seemed to make a commit when you did a `git pull`. reply cge 6 hours agorootparentprevTo somewhat echo other comments here: users need to be very careful with the git syncing. It works most of the time when edits on git clones and edits on the web interface are being made at very separate times, and when nothing at all is done in git other than committing, pulling, and pushing (if I recall, even signing can break it). But amongst the people I know who have used Overleaf for important projects with collaborators, the git syncing has generally worked reasonably right up until it is needed the most: important, tricky changes; multiple authors meeting online and editing; oncoming deadlines for conference paper submissions resulting in many edits over a short time scale. In critical situations, it can often become unusably slow (potentially tens of minutes, to hours, to get a successful pull or push), or simply fail. One group with a paid, group subscription asked support about the instability, and was simply told their use case was unusual (writing conference papers with some git and some web editors?). They are now planning on moving away from using it. reply tombert 19 hours agorootparentprevI actually didn't know that! I do have premium through my school so I will definitely try that out. That said, I actually don't think the integrated Overleaf editor is bad. They have Vim keystroke support, so I can fairly easily use it without much trouble on my end. reply setopt 6 hours agorootparentThe online editor is OK, I also use it (with Vim keybindings) sometimes for quick/minor edits. I’m not comfortable using it for extended work though. I miss things like surround text objects for TeX environments and macros (provided by evil-tex or vimtex), ergonomic entry of equations (provided by CDLaTeX or by the vimtex insert-mode bindings), autoformatting (provided by latexindent), and some navigational abilities (e.g. being able to jump to the documentation of TeX packages with a single keybinding). On top of that, there’s the missing general editor plugins… And at least on MacOS, their PDF viewer is quite blurry compared to the native viewers :) With that said, I think Overleaf is great, and it’s made LaTeX itself much more accessible for a wider audience. But for me, it pales in comparison to a local Emacs or Vim configuration… reply ramenbytes 18 hours agorootparentprevLike a sibling comment mentioned, it sucks for synchronous work with colleagues. Async is fine though. reply lupire 18 hours agorootparentHow often are you working on the same section of a document simultaneously? reply ramenbytes 17 hours agorootparentUsually right before deadlines. reply etrautmann 18 hours agorootparentprevIt definitely happens if you’re writing in the same room with someone. I’ve done this with advisors or other students, not all the time but with enough regularity to make it relevant. reply felipefar 17 hours agoparentprevI might be going against the current here, but why Markdown? Hardly anyone outside tech knows how to write using Markdown, and a rich text editor with good shortcuts will cater to both non-tech and tech audience. All in all, I agree that writing in LaTex can be painful. I've wasted too many hours after having fallen into LaTex rabbit holes trying to fix obscure errors and weird rendering. reply tombert 17 hours agorootparentA few reasons. 1) Markdown is considerably less verbose than LaTeX. 2) Not a fan of rich text. MS Word has kind of ruined it for me, every time I write something in MS Word there it feels like some funky invisible formatting ends up messing up my document. Markdown is still all plain text so weird formatting bugs won't sneak in and I can version control it trivially with Git. 3) LaTeX has some bullshit that consistently screws me up, like having to differentiate between forward quotes and backward quotes using backticks. 4) With the Pandoc flavor of Markdown it is easy to drop into LaTeX for equations, and I can also directly use BibTeX citations. 5) If I use Markdown, I can very easily get Pandoc to directly convert it to nearly any document format I want, and it does a very good job doing so, this includes LaTeX or XeLaTeX or ConTeXt if I want to render a PDF. I don't hate LaTeX or anything, I just find Markdown more pleasant, and with Pandoc I can easily convert it to LaTeX later to render. reply meling 12 hours agoparentprevYeah, as a supervisor for bachelor, master and PhD students there are some benefits; like I can go in and comment on their thesis report directly. However, I feel it comes short is when there are several people working on a paper; at least I haven’t found a way to easily see my co-authors changes/diff. Hence, when I write papers with my students I prefer that we use GitHub directly. This makes it easy to split specific changes into commits and even use pull requests for larger edits. Of course, it requires some knowledge of git, but my students (should) have this knowledge being CS students :-) I’m also not a fan of browser-based editors, but Overleaf’s editor has gotten a bit better since I first used it. reply PunchTornado 10 hours agoparentprevlast time I remember I spent 1h trying to install latex on my mac, then decided to use overleaf. reply twarge 10 hours agorootparentTexifier is incredible. So much faster and nicer than overleaf. They wrote their own display engine in Metal if I understand correctly. reply mbforbes 19 hours agoprevI also used Overleaf (and sharelatex before it) for most of my PhD and had no idea it was open source. That's awesome! I randomly logged in to Overleaf the other day to make something quick in latex, and discovered that my dissertation would no longer compile. Since I'd graduated, I no longer had access to my school's account, and dissertations are so long they time out the build on the free plan. That it's open source makes me feel better about ever being able to reproduce a build someday if I needed to. (As I write this, I realize I never will. But the it's the feeling that counts!) reply quenix 4 hours agoparentWhy don’t you download the project .zip file from Overleaf and simply compile the project locally on your machine for a build? reply JCharante 19 hours agoparentprevI’m glad they changed the name. In high school I used to mention share latex as a good online compiler and people would always give me a weird look and believe it was a prank. reply jorl17 15 hours agorootparentSharelatex and Overleaf were actually two different competing products, and one bought the other out and integrated. Source: I used sharelatex before and all my stuff from 10 years ago is now on overleaf, even though I don't even use it! reply kaladin-jasnah 19 hours agoprevOverleaf's documentation is great for learning LaTeX, but I'd never realized the product itself was free software licensed under AGPLv3, so I thought this was worth posting! reply bluish29 19 hours agoparentIt is easy to self-host too [1] [1] https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/blob/main/docker-compos... reply wizerno 18 hours agoparentprevExactly. I had the same thought so I checked the website again and there is almost none to no mention of \"open-source\" or their GitHub repository link anywhere. Quite likely being done to drive more users to buy subscriptions instead of self-hosting it. reply TheBaddest 14 hours agoprevI started using LaTeX with Overleaf in college, and it quickly became a game-changer for me. From meticulously crafting lab reports to designing a Beamer slideshow for my senior capstone project, I spent countless hours on Overleaf, creating documents that I was genuinely proud of. The intuitive interface made the entire process not only efficient but also enjoyable. While I primarily use it for my CV now, I still appreciate the power and elegance of Overleaf every time I need to update my resume. reply meling 12 hours agoparentI loved to read this: “genuinely proud of”… as a professor I read a lot of thesis reports (bachelor and master) for grading them, and many of them can’t honestly be proud of their reports. I wish more students would be more curious to learn how to prepare nice looking documents. reply EmilioMartinez 4 hours agoprevFor my thesis I'm leveraging Overleaf's Lua compilation to automagically input all tex files in a given folder. It organizes them into chapters/sections/etc matching the folder hierarchy, sorting by leading indices in the folders' or files' name (eg \"35 Topology.tex\"). This allows me to split/collapse/reorder sections on a whim, keeping the table of contents in sync with the filesystem. I find it particularly useful as I'm developing a complex framework with yet unclear scope and internal logic. Btw, it supports commands (using ø) in the filesystem to write special characters in the titles. If there's any interest I would like to share it, if only for the \"import all files in folder\" thing. But how should I go about sharing it? A Github repo? Or somewhere inside Overleaf? reply abhgh 18 hours agoprevI used to run LaTeX on my 3 machines, switching between them based on compute/portability of the machine, and used a git repo for syncing. So it doesn't give me something novel; but the convenience of overleaf has been amazing. Once you get used to the \"write and forget\" model, it's hard to go back (but still doable). It especially shines when you have to collaborate. The convenience of small features also add up, such as being able to leave comments for your collaborators, clicking on the LaTeX document to have the PDF viewer scroll to the corresponding location, and vice-versa (doesn't work exactly the same way, but close), having a fast compile mode that keeps recompiling as you make changes (good for editing, distracting for writing, but ymmv), being able to click on the toc that is generated by overleaf in a side panel. Maybe other tools do some of these things, but having all of them in place is nice. reply ramenbytes 18 hours agoparent> Maybe other tools do some of these things, but having all of them in place is nice. Emacs. I have almost everything you mentioned out of the box with doom Emacs, and the other stuff should be trivial if it doesn't already exist. reply abhgh 17 hours agorootparentThe big hurdle now becomes that all collaborators now need to know emacs;-) But good to know! Although I am curious as to how clicking on TeX leading to scrolling the PDF to the corresponding location in the PDF would work (and vice-versa). Also for collaboration (some of my collaborators are not in the same continent) I'm assuming you need to host an emacs server; where might one typically do this? Any cloud compute provider, e.g., Linode? reply ramenbytes 17 hours agorootparent> The big hurdle now becomes that all collaborators now need to know emacs;-) As God intended. ;) They actually don't though, if they prefer to remain heathens see bottom of this reply. > Although I am curious as to how clicking on TeX leading to scrolling the PDF to the corresponding location in the PDF would work (and vice-versa). Could be wrong, but I think the synchtex files produced by builds are for that. I usually have the PDF open in one Emacs buffer (you can view pdfs in Emacs), and the TeX file open in another. Ctrl-left click in the PDF jumps to the spot in the text buffer for that spot in the PDF, and in the TeX buffer there is a keybinding to do the reverse. Probably a way to click and get there too, but I use the keybinding. > I'm assuming you need to host an emacs server No, Emacs runs locally and interfaces with the cloned git repo on your machine. Your collaborators could use Notepad for all Emacs cares, as long as they work in the same repo and push to the shared remote. reply abhgh 2 hours agorootparentWasn't aware of synchtex - read up on it a bit based on your comment, yes it looks like that might work, thanks! For collaboration, I meant real-time collaboration, where you see your collaborator's cursor or changes while you are on the document yourself. Git push/pull probably won't suffice for that, but yes, while convenient, the larger question is if all projects even need that kind of collaboration. reply oli5679 8 hours agoprevLooking at the PR history, it's interesting how few PRs are being merged per year. Of the ones that are they are very short, and typically buxfixes or changes to infrastructure rather than any new features. I think I count 4 prs merged, with less than 20 lines of code altered, since 2022, and even going back until the beginning of the 2014 commit history, it's hard to find a PR that's altering core functionality. https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Ame... 2024 +1 -1 A user should be created and a mail with an activation URL should be sent. #1208 +6 -6 Fix 502 errors due to IPv6 #1175 +1 -1 Make the number of max entities per project configurable #1108 2023 +6 -0 added SIGKILL timeouts for docker and phusion_image #1090 reply Sayrus 8 hours agoparentLooking at the commits history[1], they are very probably using something else than (public) GitHub for many Pull Requests.

I use Vim for text editing and don't want to be forced into some web editing tool. Also, when I review student writing I want them to actually look at the edits I make and understand the reasoning behind them. Overleaf makes that harder. I know there is Git integration but last time I checked it was kind of clanky and also required the paid version. reply ufo 3 hours agoparentI'm also a fan of git+text editor but I do miss the collaborative editing. In the final stage of writing a paper, I want to be able to sit on a video conference call and both people edit the document at the same time, without having to stop to push and pull every little edit. Unfortunately, it seems that most collaborative editing tools are web or work on a client-server model where only the \"server\" has the actual files and can compile them to pdf. (The client can collaboratively edit raw latex but can't see the resulting pdf) reply nanna 3 hours agoparentprevOverleaf supports a basic git push and pull setup. Everything on one branch, no staging, no commit messages on overleafs side. I've used it for pulling to a server and then having new Tex files migrated into wordpress.

Students do love to over complicate things. reply jillesvangurp 12 hours agoparentDocker sounds about right for Latex given its gazillion dependencies with multiple alternatives and choices for several of those. I haven't really needed or used it in many years but it always was a bit of a beast to install. Early Linux in the nineties of course came with convenient package management that somewhat hides this. But dealing with e.g. windows or mac setups exposes a bit more that it's quite a bit of cruft that is getting installed. reply meling 12 hours agoparentprevInstalling texlive is not hard; never used Docker. https://tug.org/texlive/ The macOS installer is very easy to use and you can even install a basic version that installs the main latex packages you need (91MB).

The sound of \"Leaf\" could be represented by any number of possible spellings, eg \"leave\", \"lief\", \"leeve\"... - not all are standard English words, but neither is \"Overleaf\", and exotic/made-up spelling would be just par for the course for a tech product with an exotic/made-up name. I actually really liked the domain name writelatex.com, because it pretty much tells you what you can do and it's easy to remember, even if you haven't used it in a long time (which could easily happen for a product that gets used a lot in academia and much less outside, eg someone returning to school after a few years of work). reply JohnHammersley 7 hours agorootparentAh yes, I missed some important context - one of the reasons for moving to a name without LaTeX in it was because we'd just released the first beta version of the visual editor (the rich text mode at the time), and the goal was to keep lowering the barriers to getting started with LaTeX, and to make collaboration easier for non-LaTeX users. And so Overleaf came from a search for a broader name than writeLaTeX. That's an interesting point about the pronunciation - overleaf is a standard English word, and certainly seemed less confusing than writeLaTeX when said aloud, but I agree it's not perfect! Was the best we could find at the time (especially given the other needs mentioned above). reply belinder 19 hours agoprevBeen using this for over a decade, back when it was called sharelatex.

It wasn't a rename as such.) I've used Overleaf before the ShareLaTex merge strictly for the collaboration feature - setting up and using LaTeX on Ubuntu was easy enough, especially since pdflatex (just tex -> PDF, no more tex -> DVI -> PostScript -> PDF nonsense!) and me or a collaborator usually compiled the final PDF locally IIRC. reply sega_sai 17 hours agorootparentActually Overleaf was called WriteLatex before.

Word? I wouldn't recommend LaTeX to a casual user writing the occasional letter or memo, but if you're writing an academic paper with equations, figures, references, etc., then Word is a massive pain. Markup languages like LaTeX take some initial investment to learn, but at a certain level of complexity, they become less of a pain than a WYSIWYG editor like Word. As for your comparison to Notepad, I wasn't aware that Notepad allowed simultaneous, collaborative editing by multiple online users, revision tracking, continuous compilation of markup to PDF, and jumping between the same location in the markup and compiled PDF. Notepad must have come a long way since the last time I used it. reply dash2 3 hours agorootparent [–] Markdown. There is some exaggeration in my \"Notepad\", but the fact is, Overleaf lacks many features of a decent modern text editor, starting with a decent menu bar, all wrapped in the awkwardness of using a web browser as the main window, plus having to upload all files to a shared web space where your tools aren't available.

Having it native in the browser could be really positive for a lot of use cases depending on whether the local version can do things like RAG using locally stored data, and generate structured information like JSON. I don't think this is a terrible idea. LLM-powered apps are here to stay, so browsers making them better is a good thing. Using a local model so queries aren't flying around to random third parties is better for privacy and security. If Google can make this work well it could be really interesting. reply richardw 14 hours agoparentApple might have an advantage given they’ll have custom hardware to drive it, and the ability to combine data from outside the browser with data inside it. But it’s an interesting idea. reply jchw 13 hours agorootparentApple may have a bit of a lead in getting it actually deployed end-to-end but given the number of times I've heard \"AI accelerator\" in reference to mobile processors I'm pretty sure that silicon with 'NPUs' are probably all over the place already, and if they're not, they certainly will be, for better or worse. I've got a laptop with a Ryzen 7040, which apparently has XDNA processors in it. I haven't a damn clue how to use them, but there is apparently a driver for it in Linux[1]. It's hard to think of a mobile chipset launch from any vendor that hasn't talked about AI performance in some regards, even the Rockchip ARM processors seem to have \"AI engines\". This is one of those places where Apple's vertical integration has a clear benefit, but even as a bit of a skeptic regarding \"AI\" technology, it does seem there's a good chance that accelerated ML inference is going to be one of the next battlegrounds for processor mobile performance and capability, if it hasn't started already. [1]: https://github.com/amd/xdna-driver reply richardw 12 hours agorootparentFor sure many devices will have them, but the trick will be to build this local web model in a way that leverages all of the local chips. Apple’s advantage is in not having to worry about all that. It has a simpler problem and better access to real local data. Give my personal local data to a model running in the browser? Just feels a bit more risky. reply jitl 5 hours agorootparentI think they’ll package a variety of model formats and download the appropriate one for the user’s system. Apple and Microsoft both offer OS-level APIs that abstract over the specific compute architecture so within the platform you don’t need further specialization. On Apple hardware they’ll run their model via CoreML on whichever set of compute (CPU, GPU, NPU) makes sense for the task. On Windows it will use DirectML for the same. I’m not sure if there’s a similar OS abstraction layer on Linux, possibly there they’ll just use CPU inference or whatever stack they usually use on Android. reply rfoo 12 hours agorootparentprev> in a way that leverages all of the local chips Which, in a way, is similar to building a browser leveraging all of the local GPUs to do render and HW-accelerated video decoding.

This place has gone completely to shit. reply thiht 6 hours agorootparentAs an example jQuery literally started as a wrapper lib around JS features, and it became so influential over time that tons of features from jQuery were upstreamed to JS. Yes, wrapping stuff to give a different developer experience contributes to new ideas, and can evolve into something more. reply darepublic 3 hours agorootparentIt's a double edged sword. I suppose when I started my career I would just take the popularity of something as proof positive it was truly helpful. At this point I am a lot more cynical having gone experienced the churn of what is popular in the industry. I would say jQuery was definitely a good thing, because of the state of web at the time and the disparity between browsers. More recently, and on topic, I am dubious about langchain and the notion of doing away with composing your own natural language prompts from the start. I know of at least some devs whose interactions with llm are restricted solely to using langchain, and have never realized how easy it is to, say, prompt the llm for json adhering to a schema by just, you know, asking it. I suppose eventually frameworks/ wrappers will arise around in-browser ai models. But I see a danger in people being so eager to incuriously adopt the popular even as it bloats their project size unnecessarily. If we forecast ahead, if LLMs become ever better, then the need for wrappers should diminish I would think. It would suck if AI and language models got ever better but we still were saddled with the same bloat, cognitive and code size, just because of human nature. reply Rauchg 15 hours agoparentprevSomeone in our community created a provider and I wanted to showcase it. It’s nice insofar with very little abstraction, runtime, and bundle size overhead, you can easily switch between models without having to learn a new API. reply simonw 12 hours agoprevIf this is the API that Google are going with here: const model = await window.ai.createTextSession(); const result = await model.prompt(\"3 names for a pet pelican\"); There's a VERY obvious flaw: is there really no way to specify the model to use? Are we expecting that Gemini Nano will be the one true model, forever supported by this API baked into the world's most popular browser? Given the rate at which models are improving that would be ludicrous. But... if the browser model is being invisibly upgraded, how are we supposed to test out prompts and expect them to continue working without modifications against whatever future versions of the bundled model show up? Something like this would at least give us a fighting chance: const supportedModels = await window.ai.getSupportedModels(); if (supportedModels.includes(\"gemini-nano:0.4\")) { const model = await window.ai.createTextSession(\"gemini-nano:0.4\"); // ... reply j10u 11 hours agoparentI'm pretty sure that with time, they will be forced to let users choose the model.

That doesn't really seem possible (mobile data connection) or convenient (Chrome binary size, disk space) for the user. reply hysan 3 hours agorootparentI don’t think you’d need to download on the fly. You can imagine models being installed like extensions where chrome comes with Gemini installed by default. Then have the API allow for falling back to the default (Gemini) or throwing an error when no model is available. I’d contend that this would be a better API design because the user can choose to remove all models to save space on devices where AI is not needed (ex: kiosk). reply zelphirkalt 10 hours agorootparentprevOnly that it will take 5-10y to be regulated, until they will have to pay a measly fine, and let users choose. But then we will have the same game as with GDPR conformity now, companies left and right acting as if they just misunderstood the \"new\" rules and are still learning how this big mystery is to be understood, until a judge tells them to cut the crap. Then we will have the big masses, that will not care and feed all kinds of data into this AI thing, even without asking people it concerns for consent. Oh and then of course Google will claim, that it is all the bad users doing that, and that it is so difficult to monitor and prevent. reply pmg0 10 hours agoparentprev> But... if the browser model is being invisibly upgraded, how are we supposed to test out prompts and expect them to continue working without modifications against whatever future versions of the bundled model show up? Pinning the design of a language model task against checkpoint with known functionality is critical to really support building cool and consistent features on top of it However the alternative to an invisibly evolving model is deploying an innumerable number of base models and versions, which web pages would be free to select from. This would rapidly explode the long tail of models which users would need to fetch and store locally to use their web pages, eg HF's long tail of LoRA fine tunes all combinations of datasets & foundation models. How many foundation model + LoRAs can people store and run locally? So it makes some sense for google to deploy a single model which they believe strikes a balance in the size/latency and quality space. They are likely looking for developers to build out on their platform first, bringing features to their browser first and directing usage towards their models.

At the end of the day that’s still equivalent to Models[“GeminiNano04”] In C# you can’t compile a reference to Models.Potato04 unless Potato04 exists. In JS it’s perfectly legal to have code that references non-existant properties, so there’s no real developer ergonomics benefit here. On the contrary, code like `ai.createTextSession(“Potato:4”)` can throw an error like “Model Potato:4 doesn’t exist, try Potato:1”, whereas `ai.createTextSession(ai.Models.Potato04)` can only throw an error like “undefined is not a Model. Pass a string here”. Or you can make ai.Models a special object that throws when undefined properties are accessed, but then it’s annoying to write code that sniffs out which models are available. reply Kwpolska 11 hours agoparentprevSince when can you expect stability with random bullshit generators?

I'm a huge fan of local AI, and of empowering web browsers as a platform, but I'm feeling pretty stumped by this one. Is this a good inclusion at this time? Or is the Chrome team following the Google-wide directive to integrate AI _everywhere_, and we're getting a weird JS API as a result?

Didn’t Chrome slowly become popular using Google's own marketing channel, search? That’s what I thought. > MS lost it's hold on the web because of regulatory action Well, not only. They objectively made a worse product for decades and used their platform to push it, much more effectively than Google too. They are still pushing Edge hard, with darker patterns than Google imo. In either case, the decision to adopt Chromium wasn’t forced. Microsoft clearly must have been aligned enough on the capability model to not deem it a large risk, and continued to push for Edge just as they did with IE. reply zmmmmm 16 hours agoparentprevBy default, the W3C process actually requires multiple implementations before something is supposed to be standardised. So it is actually necessary that browser vendors ship vendor-specific implementations before the standards process can properly consider things like this. If Mozilla jumps on board and makes a compatible implementation that back ends to eg: local llama then you would have the preconditions necessary for it to become standardised. As long as Google hasn't booby trapped it by making it somehow highly specific to chrome / google / Gemini etc. reply firtoz 16 hours agoparentprevBrowser extensions should be able to shim or even overwrite the `.ai` object in the window, so it should be possible to add ollama etc to all browsers through extensions with the same API, making it a defacto standard It should be simple enough to do that I believe at least 3-5 people are going to be doing this if it's not done already Hell, if nobody does it I will do it reply firtoz 16 hours agorootparentFurther notes: I had been thinking and speaking in public about how to make a \"Metamask but for AI instead of crypto\" but I thought it would be impossible for websites to adopt it Now thanks to Google it's possible to piggy back onto the API I'm very happy about this reply niutech 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's already done: https://windowai.io reply kccqzy 16 hours agoparentprevI don't think so.

Back when Opera was adding a local AI to their browser UI, I had explained how I wanted it to be exposed as an API, as it seems like one of the few ACTUAL good uses for a user agent API: letting me choose which model I am using and where my data is going, rather than the website I am using (which inherently will require standardizing an API surface in the browser websites can use instead of trying to compete for scant memory resources by bringing their own local model or shipping my data off to some remote API). https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39920803 > So while I am usually the person who would much rather the browser do almost nothing that isn't a hardware interface, requiring all software (including rendering) to be distributed as code by the website via the end-to-end principal--making the browser easy to implement and easy to secure / sandbox, as it is simply too important of an attack surface to have a billion file format parsing algorithms embedded within it--I actually would love (and I realize this isn't what Opera is doing, at least yet) to have the browser provide a way to get access to a user-selected LLM: the API surface for them--opaque text streaming in both directions--is sufficiently universal that I don't feel bad about the semantic lock-in and I just don't see any reasonable way to do this via the end-to-end principal that preserves user control over tradeoffs in privacy, functionality, and cost... if I go to a website that uses an LLM I should be the one choosing which LLM it is using, NOT the website!!, and if I want it to use some local model or the world's most powerful cloud model, I 1) should be in control of that selection and 2) pretty much have to be for local models to be feasible at all as I can't sit around downloading and caching gigabytes of data, separately, from every service that might make use of an LLM. (edit: Ok, in thinking about it a lot more maybe it makes more sense for this to be a separate daemon run next to the web browser--even if it comes with the web browser--which merely provides a localhost HTTP interface to the LLM, so it can also be shared by native apps... though, I am then unsure how web applications would be able to access them securely due to all of the security restrictions on cross-origin insecure port access.) reply haolez 12 hours agoprevOn a side note, I think window.assistant might be a better name.

You can use latents as the images, and use the locally running image generation model to expand the latents to full images. In fact any kind of decoder model, including text models can use the same principle to lossily compress data. Of course, hallucination will be a thing...

For instance I don't need my browser to pass the Turing test. I might need better filtering and better search, but it also doesn't need to be baked in the browser. Your analogy to electricity is interesting: do you feel the need to add electricity to your bed, dining table, chairs, shelves, bathroom shower, nose clip etc. We kept electric and non electric things somewhat separate, even as each tool and appliance can work together (e.g. my table has a power strip clipped to it, but both are completely separate things) reply visarga 12 hours agorootparentFiltering, search, summarization, reranking, and security protection (pishing, data leaks) - the necessary functionality adds up reply makeitdouble 11 hours agorootparentThese are all currently independent plugins or applications that operate partly regardless of the browser they target. In particular I get to choose the best options for each of them (in particular search, filtering and security being independent from each other seems like a core requirement to me). The most telling part to me is how extensions come and go, and we move on from one to the other. The same kind of rollover won't be an option with everything in Apple's AI for instance. This could come down the divide between the Unix philosophy of a constellation of specialized tools working together or a huge monolith responsible for everything. I don't see the latter as a viable approach at scale. reply hypeatei 15 hours agorootparentprev> Why is it brain rot?

I'd love your feedback! skeeter2020 1 hour agoI love that we're seeing a lot of projects apply the KISS principal and leverage (or take inspiration) from SQLite, like this, PocketBase and even DuckDB. An entire generation of developers (including myself) were tricked into thinking you had to build for scale from day one, or worse, took the path of least resistance right to the most expensive place for cloud services: the middle. I'm hopeful the next generation will have their introduction to building apps with simple, easy to manage & deploy stacks. The more I learn about SQLite, the more I love it. reply memset 1 hour agoparentThank you for the kind words! I wanted to get something out even if it doesn't have the scalability stuff built. But I have been thinking and architecting that behind the scenes, and now I \"only\" need to turn it into code. I think the queue itself will end up using a number of technologies: SQLite for some data (ie, organizing messages by date and queue), RocksDB for other things (fast lookup for messages), DuckDB (for message statistics and metadata), and other data structures. I find that some of the most performant software often uses a mix of different data structures and algorithms by introspecting the nature of the data it has. And if I can make one node really sing, then I can have confidence that distributing that will yield results. I think SQLite is a great start, but I really do want the software to be able to utilize the full resources the underlying hardware. reply jmspring 24 minutes agoparentprev\"build for scale\", it really depends what needs to scale and what is \"scale\".

I'm also using it for local self hosting side projects. reply deskr 46 minutes agoprevPerhaps do a small example application. go get github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ/models go: github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ@v0.0.0-20240630162953-46f8b2266d60 requires go >= 1.22.2; switching to go1.22.4 go: github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ@v0.0.0-20240630162953-46f8b2266d60 (matching github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ/models@upgrade) requires github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ@v0.0.0-20240630162953-46f8b2266d60: parsing go.mod: module declares its path as: q but was required as: github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ reply memset 34 minutes agoparentGood idea! fyi this is not meant to be used as a library. It runs as a standalone server, and then your application connects to it using an existing AWS sdk. reply mannyv 51 minutes agoprevSo I assume it does the back-end as well? I never cared to figure out what parts of SQS are clients-side and server side, but - does SmoothMQ support long polling, batch delivery, visibility timeouts, error handling, and - triggers? Or are triggers left to whatever is implementing the queue? Both FiFo and simple queues? Do you have throughput numbers? As an SQS user, a table of SQS features vs SmoothMQ would be handy. If it's just an API-compatible front-end then that would be good to know. But if it does more that would also be good to know. The reason you'd use this is because there are lots of clients who still want on-prem solutions (go figure). Being able to switch targets this way would be handy. reply memset 35 minutes agoparentEverything here is on the backend. The client does very little except make api calls. It implements many of these features so far (ie, visibility timeouts) and there are some that are still in progress (long polling.) a compatibility table is a good idea. reply hrisen 2 hours agoprevKeeping questions from scale & benchmarks aside, this is a cool thing for functional/unit testing module that uses SQS, instead of dumb mocks. reply memset 2 hours agoparentThank you! Yes, you should definitely use this instead of localstack :) reply philippta 1 hour agoprevOne quick suggestion on project structure: Move all the structs from models/ into the root directory. This allow users of this package to have nice and short names like: q.Message and q.Queue, and avoids import naming conflicts if the user has its own „models“ package. reply memset 1 hour agoparentThanks for the tip - and for even looking at the code! I always struggle to figure out how to organize things. reply philippta 55 minutes agorootparentJust noticed that your root directory is already „package main“ so you can either move that to /cmd/something/ or simply rename models/ to q/. That would have the same effect and is also idiomatic. reply slotrans 1 hour agoprevNot sure about the goal of providing a hosted service cheaper than SQS. SQS is already one of the cheapest services on Earth. It's pretty hard to spend more than a few bucks a month, even if you really try! reply memset 1 hour agoparentThat is fair. Two things to validate from a biz perspective: 1. Is there some threshold where this would make sense financially (n billions of messages.) 2. Are the extra developer features (ie, larger message sizes, observability, DAGs) worth it for people to switch? Would love your thoughts - what, if anything, would make you even entertain moving to a different queue system? reply yimpolo 2 hours agoprevThis is super cool! I love projects that aim to create simple self-hostable alternatives to popular services. I assume this would work without much issue with Litestream, though I'm curious if you've already tried it. This would make a great ephemeral queue system without having to worry about coordinating backend storage. reply memset 2 hours agoparentI haven't tried this with litestream! It will be worth exploring that as a replication strategy. The nice thing about queues is that backend storage doesn't really need to be coordinated. Like, you could have two servers, with two sets of messages, and the client can just pull from them round robin. They (mostly) don't need to coordinate at all for this to work. However, this is different for replication where we have multiple nodes as backups. reply jerrygenser 2 hours agoprev> In terms of monetization, the goal is to just have a hosted queue system. I believe this can be cheaper than SQS without sacrificing performance. Just as Backblaze and Minio have had success competing in the S3 space, I wanted to take a crack at queues. are you monetizing this as a separate business from: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/scratch-data reply memset 2 hours agoparentTruthfully, I don't know yet - I haven't even built a paid/hosted version at all. It is related to my existing business in the sense that it deals with realtime data. But I started working this as something I wish existed as opposed to having some big VC strategy and pitch deck behind it. (Also, I appreciate all of your feedback on this a month ago! It was really helpful to encourage me to keep looking into this and also figuring out the \"first\" things to launch with!) reply Onavo 1 hour agoparentprevWhat's the point of AGPL though? The enterprises with the budget for self hosting this sort of software usually have requirements and scale beyond what SQLite can offer out of the box. reply 4RealFreedom 1 hour agoprevThe goals are a little different but I think it's worth pointing out ElasticMQ. I use it simulate sqs in a docker environment. https://github.com/softwaremill/elasticmq reply memset 1 hour agoparentI have looked at elasticmq but not played with it myself. You might also be interested in their benchmarks of all of the existing queues out there: https://softwaremill.com/mqperf/ reply julius 30 minutes agorootparentI also just used ElasticMQ in a docker environment. Did you see any specific downsides, when you looked at it? In which scenarios should I consider replacing it with your solution? reply chromanoid 1 hour agoprevCould you elaborate why you didn't choose e.g. RabbitMQ? I mean you talk about AMQP and such, it seems to me, that a client-side abstraction would be much more efficient in providing an exit strategy for SQS than creating an SQS \"compatible\" broker. For example in the Java ecosystem there is https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/latest/ that serves a similar purpose. reply stuaxo 2 hours agoprevGood, we need open implementations of all the AWS stuff. I swear they reimplement stuff we have just so there are more places to bill us. reply memset 2 hours agoparentCurious: if you were going to switch, how would you want to run this? Would you want to deploy it to your own EC2 instances, or would you want a hosted solution (just as SQS itself is?) reply nilamo 1 hour agorootparentIdeally this would be run within a k8s cluster, to easily fit with the other services. reply stackskipton 1 hour agorootparentprevSelf hosted probably. Why buy knock off SQS in the cloud when real thing is right there? If you are greenfield and scared of hitching yourself to Amazon, why not go something like RabbitMQ? There is also RabbitMQ cloud providers as well. reply jpalomaki 35 minutes agorootparentUnless you need the features, I would steer away from the \"real message queues\". Running these adds complexity, especially if you want higher availability and they are not always cheap. HTTP based solution is easy to understand and implemented (if basic functionality is enough for your use case). Real MQs obviously have more complex protocols and not all client libraries are perfect. reply stackskipton 22 minutes agorootparentI find basics of most AMQP systems to be extremely reliable. Message on, one time delivery with message hiding until expiration of TTL. Sure, you can get into some insane setups with RabbitMQ/Kafka and that's where libraries features don't always match up. But SQS probably wouldn't work for you either in those cases. reply rmbyrro 1 hour agoprevI'd have named it MQLite. Congrats on finishing and delivering a project, this is quite a challenge in itself. I think SQLite can be a great alternative for many kinds of projects. reply localfirst 6 minutes agoprevFYI, this has AGPL 3.0 licensing. When I see this I assume VC backed cloud monetization is in the works. We need to include license information in Show HN projects to save people time-- our company find non MIT/BSD license projects are problematic and needlessly complicates things. reply systemz 2 hours agoprevVery cool. I needed something like this. Looking at short video in readme - I suspect adding live stats similar to sidekiq would make UI look more dynamic and allow quick diagnostics. Docs for current features are more important though. reply memset 2 hours agoparentCan you tell me more about why you needed this (and what you ended up using?) Totally agree on adding more metrics and information to the UI - but how much of that should be on the dashboard vs exposed as a prometheus metric for someone to use their dashboard tool of choice? I am not very good at visual design and have chosen the simplest possible tech to build it (static rendering + fomanticUI). I sometimes wonder if the lack of react or tailwind or truly beautiful elements will hold the project back. reply fbdab103 2 hours agoprevMinor thing - the gif browser demo should have been maximized. The video zooming into the action on what would have fit onto a single screen was distracting. Are there maintenance actions that the admin needs to perform on the database? How are those done? reply memset 2 hours agoparentThank you for the feedback - agree on the gif. Also it should probably show real messages an an example instead of rand(). re: maintenance - I have tried to build this to be hands-off. The only storage this uses is SQLite, and I have the code set to automatically vacuum as space increases. It also has a /metrics endpoint which has disk size. This is going to be used for two things in the future: first, as a metric for autoscaling (scale when disk is full) and second so that a server can stop serving requests when its disk is full (to prevent catastrophic failure.) reply sgarland 2 hours agoprevThis looks great! How were you planning on tackling distributed? reply memset 2 hours agoparentThis is a great question and something I've been thinking about a lot. Big picture: Each queue node can operate (mostly) independently, and this is good. As a consumer, I don't really care where my next message comes from, so I can minimize the amount of data that needs to have a \"leader\". The only data that needs to be synced is the list of queues, which doesn't change often. If one server is full, it should be able to route a request to another server. When we downscale, we can use S3/Dynamo (GCS/firestore) to store items and redistribute. There's more nitty gritty here (what about FIFO queues? What about replication?) but the fact that the main actions, \"enqueue\" and \"dequeue\", don't require lots of coordination makes this easier to reason about comapred to a full RDBMS. reply flaminHotSpeedo 3 minutes agorootparentYou're hand-waving away all the complexity in the \"nitty gritty.\" Enqueue absolutely requires coordination, if not via leader then at least amongst multiple nodes, if you want to guarantee at least once delivery If you don't guarantee that, cool, but you're not competing with sqs reply sgarland 1 hour agorootparentprevThis would increase the complexity, but you could always run something like rqlite [0], even if only for the items that require distribution and synchronization. Or if you truly only need to store simple values in a distributed fashion, you could probably use etcd for that part. [0]: https://rqlite.io/ reply okr 2 hours agoprevA testcontainer could be useful. I use always this adobe-mock from s3 for my test. Hmm. reply memset 2 hours agoparentI was not aware of testcontainer until you just mentioned it! I have a very basic Dockerfile for deploying to fly.io. What/how would I get started? It looks like localstack is a supported testcontainer and they do support SQS (but I haven't tried it myself.) reply 12_throw_away 1 hour agoprevActually pretty excited to try this, there are so many cases where I need a bare-bones (aka \"simple\"), local, persistent queue, but all the usual suspects (amqp, apache whatever, cloud nonsense, etc.) are way too heavy. I'll probably try poking at it directly through the HTTP API rather than an SDK ... does it need AWS V4 auth signatures or anything? reply memset 1 hour agoparentThe only HTTP API that is exposed is actually the SQS one. (I'm not opposed to a \"regular\" HTTP API but the goal was to make it easy for people to use existing libraries.) If you do use your language's AWS SDK, the code handles [1] all of the V4 auth stuff. https://github.com/poundifdef/SmoothMQ/blob/main/protocols/s... I'd love your feedback! Particularly the difficulties you find in running it, of which I'm sure there are many, so I can fix them or update docs. reply stackskipton 1 hour agoparentprevI'd also give a shout out to beanstalkd. I use it to teach message systems and it's great. reply tjoff 3 hours agoprevSQS: Amazon Simple Queue Service reply cwbrandsma 2 hours agoparentThank you, I was scratching my head trying to figure that out. reply rmbyrro 1 hour agorootparentWhy some people think we need AI everywhere to \"augment\" and \"enrich\" our \"experiences\".

I'm guessing it happily handles thousands of queue operations a second given that it's SQLite and Go - would be interesting to see how settings like SQLite WAL mode affect its performance. reply memset 2 hours agorootparent [–] I'm using WAL mode - I'd almost given up on sqlite until I remembered to enable it. I've been playing with benchmarks, yes! I haven't written them up yet because I worry about doing them the \"right\" way. but since you asked, I did a quick test with a single server and single client on a t2.nano. With 3 sending threads and 5 receiving threads, and mesg size of 2kb, I can send 700 msgs/s and receiver 500 msgs/s. It is way faster on my laptop, and I have a lot of tricks that I've been playing with to improve this. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentI had to build a queue implementation not too long ago. We used t2.nano for our benchmarks as well. Your results are in-line with ours pre-optimizations (except we are using nats jetstream for queuing). I’d also recommend reducing the number of threads as that can increase performance on single-processor machines (context switching will kill you). Try to find the sweet spot (for us, it was 2x-4x the number of cpus to threads, at least, for our workload). If you are using go, it kinda sucks at single-cpu things, and if you detect that you have a single core, you can lock a go-routine to a thread and that sometimes helps. Also, try to batch sends (aka, for-loop) to attempt to saturate the send-side so by the time you come back with your next batch they’re still messages sitting in a network buffer somewhere. For example, we have a channel that wakes up our sender, then we honest-to-god wait like 60ms in the hopes there will be more than one message to pick up — and there usually is in production. reply memset 1 hour agorootparentThese are great suggestions. Today every db write is indeed wrapped in a mutex. The two optimizations I am experimenting with are: 1. When new messages are inserted, immediately append to a file on disk. Then, in batch, insert to SQLite. 2. When dequeuing messages, keep n message IDs in memory as a ready queue, and then keep dequeued message IDs in another list. Those can be served immediately (using a SELECT which is fast) and then updating messages to the dequeued status can happen in batch. Appreciate the tips! reply withinboredom 38 minutes agorootparentFor 1. We went with a per-routine bytes.Buffer that was batch \"inserted\" every x milliseconds or n messages. However, we don't care if we lose some messages on a crash. For integrity, some queues are set to 0ms, 1msg because we don't want to lose anything, but when it is ok that messages are lost, this is great for perf. For 2. you could probably do something like this: BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- Select the oldest pending message SELECT id, message FROM queue WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 100; -- Mark messages as 'processing' UPDATE queue SET status = 'processing' WHERE created_at < ?; -- assuming created_at is monotonic COMMIT; Basically, select a batch and then abuse the ordering properties to batch mark them. Then all messages in your select you can dispatch evenly to sender threads. Sender threads can then signal a buffered channel that they've completed/failed, and the database can be updated. At startup, you can just SELECT where status = 'processing' and recover. This is a pretty decent translation of how ours works. reply evantbyrne 1 hour agorootparentprev [–] You might need dedicated resources, including storage speed guarantees, to get reproducible benchmarks out of a cloud provider. Love the red sweater btw very classy yet simple reply memset 1 hour agorootparent [–] That sweater is one of my favorite items, thank you :) The goal is for this to be able to run well on commodity hardware, which I think is possible. If I can run this on $platform with $cheap instances and an $autoscaler then that would be my ideal design goal because I think it matches the setup that most people have access to. However, I agree - I am a big fan of Hetzner's servers and am excited to try out benchmarks on beefier hardware too. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

It certainly could do though. In C, using an uninitialised variable does not mean \"whatever that memory happened to have in it before\" (although that is a potential result). Instead, it's undefined behaviour, so the compiler can do what it likes. For example, it could well unconditionally initialise that memory to 123. Alternatively, it could notice that the whole snippet has undefined behaviour so simply replace it with no instructions, so it doesn't print anything at all. It could even optimise away the return that presumably follows that code in a function, so it ends up crashing or doing something random. It could even optimise away the instructions before that snippet, if it can prove that they would only be executed if followed by undefined behaviour – essentially the undefined behaviour can travel back in time! reply uecker 7 hours agoparentUB can not travel back in time in C. Although it is true that it can affect previous instructions, but that code is reordered or transformed in complicated ways is true even without UB. reply emmericp 6 hours agorootparentThe time-travelling UB interpretation was popularized by this blog post about 10 years ago [1].

[1] https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140627-00/?p=63... reply uecker 6 hours agorootparentYes, random blog posts did a lot of damage here. Also broken compilers [1]. Note that blog post is correct about C++ but incorrectly assumes this is true for C as well. [1]. https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Invalid-optimi... reply kibwen 5 hours agorootparentI'm inclined to trust Raymond Chen and John Regehr on these matters, so if you assert that they're incorrect here then a source to back up your assertion would help your argument. reply uecker 4 hours agorootparentI am a member of WG14. You should check the C standard. I do not see how \"time-travel\" is a possible reading of the definition of UB in C. We added another footnote to C23 to counter this idea: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3220.pdf \"Any other behavior during execution of a program is only affected as a direct consequence of the concrete behavior that occurs when encountering the erroneous or non portable program construct or data. In particular, all observable behavior (5.1.2.4) appears as specified in this document when it happens before an operation with undefined behavior in the execution of the program.\" I should point out that compilers also generally do not do true time-travel: Consider this example: https://godbolt.org/z/rPG14rrbj reply grumbelbart 2 hours agorootparentSo maybe we have different definitions of \"time travel\". But I recall that - if a compiler finds that condition A would lead to UB, it can assume that A is never true - that fact can \"backpropagate\" to, for example, eliminate comparisons long before the UB. Here is an older discussion: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/291548 Is that / will that no longer be true for C23? Or does \"time-travel\" mean something else in this context? reply uecker 1 hour agorootparentThere may be different definitions, but also a lot of incorrect information. Nothing changes with C23 except that we added a note that clarifies that UB can not time-travel. The semantic model in C only requires that observable effects are preserved. Everything else can be changed by the optimizer as long as it does not change those observable effects (known as the \"as if\" principle). This is generally the basis of most optimizations. Thus, I call time-travel only when it would affect previous observable effects, and this what is allowed for UB in C++ but not in C. Earlier non-observable effects can be changed in any case and is nothing speicifc to UB. So if you call time-travel also certain optimization that do not affect earlier observable behavior, then this was and is still allowed. But the often repeated statement that a compiler can assume that \"A is never true\" does not follow (or only in very limited sense) from the definition of UB in ISO C (and never did), so one has to be more careful here. In particular it is not possible to remove I/O before UB. The following code has to print 0 when called with zero and a compiler which would remove the I/O would not be conforming. int foo(int x) { printf(\"%d\", x); fflush(stdout); return 1 / x; } In the following example int foo(int x) { if (x) bar(x); return 1 / x; } the compiler could indeed remove the \"if\" but not because it were allowed to assume that x can never be zero, but because 1 / 0 can have arbitrary behavior, so could also call \"bar()\" and then it is called for zero and non-zero x and the if condition could be removed (not that compilers would do this) reply singron 1 hour agorootparentprevE.g. this godbolt: https://godbolt.org/z/eMYWzv8P8 There is unconditional use of a pointer b, which is UB if b is null. However, there is an earlier branch that checks if b is null. If we expected the UB to \"backpropagate\", the compiler would eliminate that branch, but both gcc and clang at O3 keep the branch. However, both gcc and clang have rearranged the side effects of that branch to become visible at the end of the function. I.e. if b is null, it's as if that initial branch never ran. You could observe the difference if you trapped SIGSEGV. So even though the compiler didn't attempt to \"time-travel\" the UB, in combination with other allowed optimizations (reordering memory accesses), it ended up with the same effect. reply quietbritishjim 4 hours agorootparentprev> Also broken compilers [1]. The issue you linked to is not a counter example because, as the poster said, g may terminate the program in which case that snippet does not have undefined behaviour even if b is zero. The fact that they bothered to mention that g may terminate the program seems like an acknowledgement that it would be valid to do that time travelling if it didn't. > Note that blog post is correct about C++ but incorrectly assumes this is true for C as well. Presumably you're referring to this line of the C++ standard, which does not appear in the C standard: > However, if any such execution contains an undefined operation, this International Standard places no requirement on the implementation executing that program with that input (not even with regard to operations preceding the first undefined operation). I looked at every instance of the word \"undefined\" in the C standard and, granted, it definitely didn't have anything quite so clear about time travel as that. But it also didn't make any counter claims that operations before are valid. It pretty much just said that undefined behaviour causes behaviour that is undefined! So, without strong evidence, it seem presumptuous to assume that operations provably before undefined behaviour are well defined. reply uecker 4 hours agorootparentThe poster is me. You are right that this is not an example for time-travel. There aren't really good examples for true time travel because compilers generally do not do this. But my point is that with compilers behaving like this, people might confuse this for time-traveling UB. I have certainly met some who did and the blog posts seems to have similar examples (but I haven't looked closely now). Note that I am a member of WG14. We added more clarification to C23 to make clear that this is not a valid interpretation of UB, see here: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3220.pdf reply quietbritishjim 3 hours agorootparentOk, fair enough. I must admit I was looking at C99 as I thought that was most generally relevant, I don't follow recent C standards (as much as I do those for C++) and C23 hasn't been ratified yet. I've found your new snippet: > In particular, all observable behavior (5.1.2.4) appears as specified in this document when it happens before an operation with undefined behavior in the execution of the program. I consider that a change in the standard but, of course, that's allowed, especially as it's backwards compatible for well defined programs. The wording is a little odd: it makes it sound a like you need some undefined behaviour in order to make the operations beforehand work, and, taken very literally, that operations between two undefined behaviours will work (because they're still \"before an operation with undefined behavior\"). But I suppose the intention is clear. reply uecker 3 hours agorootparentThe definition of UB (which hasn't changed) is: \"behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data, for which this document imposes no requirement.\" Note that the \"for which\" IMHO already makes this clear that this can not travel in time. When everything could be affected these words (\"for which\") would be meaningless. reply AlotOfReading 2 hours agorootparentprevI didn't notice that section when I last read through C23, but I'm very glad to see it. Reining in UB is one of the hardest problems I've had to deal with, and being able to say operations are defined up to the point of UB makes my job so much easier. The lack of clarity in earlier standards made it impossible to deal with code incrementally, since all the unknown execution paths could potentially breach back in time and smash your semantics. reply uecker 1 hour agorootparentThank you. This was my motivation. It is only a small step... much more work to do. reply ant6n 6 hours agorootparentprev> but that code is reordered or transformed in complicated ways is true even without UB. Without undefined behavior, the compiler emits code that has the behavior defined by the code —- the ordering may be altered, but not the behavior. reply uecker 6 hours agorootparentYes, and with undefined behavior, the compiler has to emit code that has the behavior defined by the code up to the operation that has undefined behavior. reply codext 19 minutes agoprevThe final obfuscated code snippet in the article brought to light another GCC extension: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34559705/ternary-conditi... reply JonChesterfield 8 hours agoprevThis features the construct switch(k) { if (0) case 0: x = 1; if (0) case 1: x = 2; if (0) default: x = 3; } which is a switch where you don't have to write break at the end of every clause. #define brkcase if (0) case That might be worth using. Compilers won't love the control flow but they'll probably delete it effectively. reply leni536 8 hours agoparentSurely the following would work just as well? #define brkcase break;case kinda defeats the purpose of the macro even. reply MaxBarraclough 7 hours agorootparentThat strikes me as better. The original macro presumably misbehaves if there's more than one statement in a sequence, as the if will only affect the first statement. reply wrsh07 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the behavior is slightly different since this one breaks the above case, and the other one only omits its case from fallthrough Incidentally, what happens if you use your brkcase as the first case? I don't find either particularly exciting - a macro that would append break to the current case feels better reply leni536 2 hours agorootparentBoth version of the macro makes this fall through from 0: switch (a) { brkcase 0: foo(); case 1: bar(); } so in a sense the `if (0) case` trick also affects the previous case, not the current one. But that one also falls apart when there are multiple statements under the brkcase. reply jppittma 8 hours agoparentprevI think it is super unclear how this works, and I would prefer the same control flow using goto, rather than the duffs device style switch abuses. reply asveikau 4 hours agoparentprevIt only works if the case label body is a single line or is enclosed in brackets. I'll confess, I've used this construct to mean \"omit the first line of the next case label but otherwise fall through\".

The current code looks very much like it was written for Python 2 (apart from the f string!), where print was a statement. As of Python 3, print is just a regular function.

Duff is trying to optimise MMIO, you wouldn't do anything close to this today even in C, not least because your MMIO is no longer similarly fast to your CPU instruction pace and for non-trivial amounts of data you have DMA (which Duff's hardware did not). In a modern language you also wouldn't treat \"MMIO\" as just pointer indirection, to make this stay working in C they have kept adding hacks to the type system rather than say OK, apparently this is an intrinsic, we should bake it into the freestanding mode of the stdlib. Edited to add: For my money the successor to Tom Duff's \"Device\" is WUFFS' \"iterate loops\" mechanism where you may specify how to partially unroll N steps of the loop, promising that this has equivalent results to running the main loop body N times but potentially faster. This makes it really easy for vectorisation to see what you're trying to do, while still handling those annoying corner cases where M % N != 0 correctly because that's the job of the tool, not the human. reply masklinn 7 hours agorootparent> Duff is relying on the fact you're allowed to intermingle the switch block and the loop That's just a special case of being able to intermingle switch with arbitrary syntax, which is what TFA does, before it jumps to computed gotos. reply doe_eyes 23 minutes agorootparentThe overarching point appears to be getting rid of angle brackets, which is not something that Duff is doing. Further, Duff's device keeps case labels on the left of its control structure; moving ifs to the left is the other \"innovation\" here. I think you really have to squint your eyes to see the similarities, beyond the general theme of exploiting the counterintuitive properties of switch statements. reply uecker 8 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what you mean by \"hacks to the type system\". All modern computing essentially converged to unified memory, which is exactly C's model. reply tialaramex 8 hours agorootparentWhile it's convenient technically to have unified memory and so it makes a lot of sense for your machine code, in fact the MMIO isn't just memory, and so to make this work anyway in the C abstract machine they invented the \"volatile\" qualifier. (I assume you weren't involved back then?) This should be a suite of intrinsics. It's the same mistake as \"register\" storage, a layer violation, the actual mechanics bleeding through into the abstract machine and making an unholy mess. If you had intrinsics it's obvious where the platform specific behaviour lives. Can we \"just\" do unaligned 32-bit stores to MMIO? Can we \"just\" write one bit of a hardware register? It depends on your platform and so as an intrinsic it's obvious how to reflect this, whereas for a type qualifier we have no idea what the compiler did and the ISO document of course has to be vague to be inclusive of everybody. reply uecker 8 hours agorootparentI wasn't involved back then, but I know the history. I thought you were talking about something more recent. But this is all opinions and terms such as \"unholy mess\" etc do not impress me. In my opinion \"volatile\" is just fine as is \"register. Neither are layer violations nor a type system problem. That the exact semantics of a volatile access are implementation defined seem natural. How is this better with an intrinsic? What I would call a mess are the atomics intrinsics, which - despite being intrinsics - are entirely unsafe and dangerous and indeed mess (just saw a couple of new bugs in our bug tracker). reply tialaramex 6 hours agorootparentSure, it's just an opinion.

Sometimes more modern languages can throw me for a loop, no pun intended, but the beauty (and horror) of C is that you are pretty close to the metal, it’s not very abstracted at all, and it allows you a lot of freedom (which is why it’s so foot gunny). I will never love anything as much as I love C, but C development jobs lie in really weird fields I’m not interested in, and I’m fairly certain I am not talented enough. I have seen C wizardry up close that I know I simply cannot do. However, one of the more useful exercises I ever did was implement basic things like a file system, command line utilities like ls/mkdir etc. Sometimes they are surprisingly complex, sometimes no. After you program in C for a while certain conventions meant to be extra careful kind of bubble up in languages in a way that seems weird to other people. for example I knew a guy that’d auto reject C PR’s if they didn’t use the syntax if (1==x) rather than if (x==1). The former will not compile if you accidentally use variable assignment instead of equality operator (which everyone has done at some point). This tendency bites me a lot in some programming cultures, people (ime) tend to find this style of programming as overly defensive. reply frou_dh 7 hours agoparent> for example I knew a guy that’d auto reject C PR’s if they didn’t use the syntax if (1==x) rather than if (x==1).

Have a wonderful day, =) reply uecker 7 hours agorootparentI absolutely I agree that learning to create you own abstractions is an incredible useful skill. It depends though. For a programming course this makes absolutely sense. But for applied problems in, say, biomedical engineering, this does not work. Many students know only a bit of Python, and then it is too much and \"too inconvenient\" to start from scratch in C. With Python they have a lot of things more easily available, so they make quick progress. This does not lead to good results though! For most of the Python projects, we end of throwing away the code later. Another problem is that students often do not know what they are doing, e.g. the use some statistical package or visualization package and get nicely looking results, but they do not know what it means and often it is entirely wrong. For machine learning projects it is even worse. So much nonsense and errors from copying other people Python code.... reply Joel_Mckay 6 hours agorootparentPython like Basic abstracted far to many details away from students, and trying to convince people they need to know how a CPU works later is nearly impossible.

El Albani, Univ. Poitiers Microtomographic reconstruction of the head and anterior trunk (“body”) limbs of the trilobite Protolenus (Hupeolenus) in ventral view. © Arnaud MAZURIER, IC2MP, Univ. Poitiers Microtomographic reconstruction of the trilobite Gigoutella mauretanica in ventral view. © Arnaud MAZURIER, IC2MP, Univ. Poitiers Press release issued: 27 June 2024 Some of the most perfectly preserved trilobite fossils ever found have revealed details of the extinct arthropod unknown until now. The new specimens, which were killed and fossilised quickly when volcanic ash smothered them underwater more than 500 million years ago, show details never before seen in any trilobite, despite the millions of fossils gathered and studied over the past two centuries. The trilobites, which are from the Cambrian period, have been the subject of research by an international team of scientists, led by Professor Abderrazak El Albani, geologist based at University of Poitiers and originally from Morocco. This international team include co-authors Harry Berks and Philip Donoghue from the University of Bristol’s School of Earth Sciences. They discovered clustering of specialised leg pairs around the mouth giving a clearer picture of how trilobites fed. Harry Berks explained: “The head and body appendages had an inward-facing battery of dense spines like those of horseshoe crabs, manipulating and tearing prey or scavenged carcasses as they were moved forwards to the mouth. “The mouth, a narrow slit behind a fleshy lobe called a labrum, known in living arthropods, has never been so clearly seen in a trilobite before.” The appendages at the edge of the mouth have curved bases like spoons and are so small that they went undetected in less perfectly preserved fossils. It was widely thought that trilobites had three pairs of head appendages behind their long antennae but both Moroccan species show that there were four pairs. The Moroccan trilobites date to the Cambrian Period, about 515 million years ago. The fossils are found in rock composed of volcanic ash, deposited on the shallow seafloor on which the trilobites lived. The trilobites, and even tiny ‘lamp shells’ (brachiopods) that attached to them via a delicate stalk in life, were killed by the hot, suffocating ash and were fossilised very quickly when the ash that encased them transformed to rock. The outer surface of the trilobites, all of their legs and the lamp shells hitching a ride on them were moulded as impressions in the volcanic rock, while the trilobites’ digestive tract was preserved after it filled with ash. To see how these impressions in the rock looked just after the trilobites died, the team used a high-resolution X-ray micro-tomography (XRµCT). X-rays detect the difference in density between the rock in which a trilobite was moulded and the empty (air) space where the body was before it was obliterated. Co-author, Harry Berks, used computer modelling of X-ray slices through the fossils to study the anatomy of the entire body of the trilobites in 3-dimensions, freed from the surrounding rock. Harry said “The computer work is pain-staking but it’s definitely been worth it. These trilobites look so alive, it’s almost as though they could crawl out of the rock.” The ‘Pompei’ trilobites are so remarkable because they are not flattened or deformed like many fossils and every leg is arranged as it was in life, with even small spines and sensory bristles along the joints of the legs preserved. “I’ve been studying trilobites for nearly 40 years, but I never felt like I was looking at live animals as much as I have with these ones”, said co-author Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum, London. The study sheds new light on the anatomy and biology of the long-vanished trilobites but also signals the enormous potential for volcanic ash deposited in shallow marine settings as a setting to search for exceptionally preserved fossils. Co-author Philip Donoghue said: “No one expects to find fossils in volcanic rocks but our study shows that volcanic ash deposits are definitely worth a look. Who knows what secrets remains to be discovered in these understudied rocks?” Trilobites are a completely extinct kind of arthropod, the group of jointed-legged animals that includes more than a million species of insects, crabs, spiders, and centipedes alive today. They are one of the most abundant and diverse lifeforms in fossil deposits of the Palaeozoic Era, surviving from 521 million years ago to 250 million years ago. Palaeontologists have described more than 20,000 species of trilobites, ranging in body length from less than two millimetres to more than 90 centimetres. Most trilobite species are only known from their hard exoskeleton (like a lobster’s shell), but only about 30 species preserve a pair of antennae and/or pairs of two-branched legs under the head shield and each segment of the body.

    "originBody": "HOME > ANTI-PIRACY > SITE BLOCKING > This month, a French court went along with a demand from Canal+ to tighten up previously obtained anti-piracy measures. The court ordered Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco to poison their DNS records to prevent these third-party services acting as workarounds for existing pirate site blockades. Cisco's response became evident on Friday when it withdrew its OpenDNS service from the entire country. In 2023, broadcaster Canal+ went to court in France with the goal of obtaining an order requiring local ISPs to block over 100 pirate sports streaming sites. The French court complied with the request; ISPs including Orange, SFR, OutreMer Télécom, Free, and Bouygues Télécom, were ordered to implement technical measures to prevent access to Footybite.co, Streamcheck.link, SportBay.sx, TVFutbol.info, and Catchystream.com, among dozens of others. Since the ISPs have their own DNS resolvers for use by their own customers, these were configured to provide non-authentic responses to deny access to the sites in question. Somewhat inevitably, some of the ISPs’ users reconfigured their machines to use third-party DNS servers, included those provided by Cloudflare, Google, and Cisco. Canal+ Targets DNS Providers To prevent these workarounds, last year Canal+ took legal action against three popular public DNS providers – Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Google (8.8.8.8), and Cisco (208.69.38.205) – demanding blocking measures similar to those already implemented by French ISPs under Article L333-10 of the French Sports Code. The Paris judicial court responded this May by handing down two orders; one concerning Premier League matches and the other relating to matches played in the Champions League. The Court ordered Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco to implement measures to prevent French internet users from using their services to access around 117 pirate domains. Google previously indicated it would comply and during the last 24 hours, OpenDNS complied too, although perhaps not in the manner Canal+ or the Court had anticipated. OpenDNS Suspends Entire Service to the Whole of France Reports of problems with the OpenDNS service seemed to begin on Friday, and it didn’t take long to discover the cause. The technical issues were isolated to France and apparently parts of Portugal too, with an explanation having appeared on the OpenDNS website, perhaps as early as Thursday evening. “Effective June 28, 2024: Due to a court order in France issued under Article L.333-10 of the French Sport code and a court order in Portugal issued under Article 210-G(3) of the Portuguese Copyright Code, the OpenDNS service is not currently available to users in France and certain French territories and in Portugal. We apologize for the inconvenience,” the announcement reads. OpenDNS doesn’t appear to have elaborated on its decision at the time of writing, but it’s certainly possible that the operators of this technical information service strongly oppose being ordered to undermine its accuracy. The demands of Canal+, with full support of courts in both France and Portugal, effectively require OpenDNS to lie in response to DNS inquiries. It’s not difficult to see why that would be a problem for the operators of entirely neutral internet infrastructure, not least because this order is almost guaranteed not to be the last of its kind. It’s a bold move that some will undoubtedly criticize. For others, the OpenDNS decision represents the type of dramatic pushback required to draw attention to anti-piracy measures that are increasingly encroaching on the vital mechanisms underpinning the internet itself.",

On the other hand thoughif your nameserver is now required to handle millions more queries per second then either you are a central piece of infrastructure like .com or a high traffic service like cat.videos.example.com. With the latter, you’ve been handling millions of HTTP queries per second anyway. You’ll just have to handle massive traffic volumes for DNS now, too.

    "originBody": "The Operational Wargame Series: The best game not in stores now June 23, 2021Mitch ReedBoard Wargames, Gaming By Mitch Reed I try not to mix my work on NDNG with my day job since despite them both having “wargame” in the title they are vastly different and done for very different reasons. Last summer I was asked by the USMC Warfighting Lab to help them playtest a game called Assassin’s Mace which is based on the Operational Wargame Series rules and is developed by the USMCWL. I was immediately impressed with the game system and felt that the hobby community would enjoy hearing about it. What Is the Operational Wargame Series? The Operational Wargame Series (OWS) is a tabletop game that allows the players to simulate combat between 2025 and 2050. The game is focused on the operational level of warfare and ties in the effects of military capabilities across all domains. The game developed by the recently Retired Col Tim Barrick and a team of designers at the USMCWL really gets to the flavor of the difficulties and myriad of decisions a commander of an operational campaign has to make. To me the beauty of the game is that Col Barrick, who is an avid hobby gamer, took some of the best mechanics from the hobby world and created a game that service members can play as a part of military education, concept development and joint campaign planning. As of now, the game as two modules, the first is Assassin’s Mace which focuses on the INDO-PACOM theater and Zapad, the newer of the modules which covers the European theater. Hobby gamers will notice how OWS is a true “hex and counter” game that many in the hobby community would be familiar with. OWS Mechanics The game map which represents the overall theater is scaled to 200nm and the tactical map is scaled to 10nm per hex which enables a team to play a large fight and a smaller on that focuses on a small part of the theater such as the island of Taiwan as seen in Assassin’s Mace. The counters, which are huge, can be used on either map and represent units such as naval ships, flying squadrons, SAM batteries and maneuver battalions/companies for the ground fight. The counters are more than just a marker that represents where a unit is on the map. The counters also function as a true unit info card which you can see it’s offensive and defensive capabilities and mark off unit status as it takes losses. The real core mechanic is how dice are used in the game. The dice act as an instant adjudicator and the system uses different sizes of dice that can be adjusted during game play. A high percentage attack would roll a d20, however if the unit is degraded it may roll a d16 or d12 depending on the status of the unit and the environment it is in. The rolls also work the other direction where a player can have a unit support a low probability attack which uses a d4 and allow it to use a bigger die, such as a d6 or d8. The game calls these shifts in a roll as being “promoted” or “demoted”, however it also shows the player how by blending or sequencing certain capabilities can increase your probability of success. OWS Gameplay The game requires the players to plan out their turn which is usually done by an informal huddle, however is a very important part of the game. Once this is done the players of both sides move all of their units simultaneously and then move into the I/O-Cyber and the ISR portion of the turn which is where you see a lot of the “promotion” and “demotion” occur. After these steps, the combat is adjudicated with air going first, followed by naval and ground combat. The 24-hour turn then ends with the regeneration phase where air units return to their bases, destroyed units can be possibly brought back in the game and things like logistics are adjusted. The turns do not take very long at all and teams of players can get in 2-3 turns in a normal work day. Military Application I was invited to the mega test of the OWS system in early April where the students of USMC War College played the game on five maps which represented the Indo-Pacific, European and the North American theaters with tactical maps for Taiwan and the Baltics. The class of about 30 students were split into two teams, with blue being the US and its allies and the Red being China and Russia. The students, which were at the O-5 and O-6 level from all the services and some allied/partner nations played the game for three full days and not only had a great time they also learned a lot. During professional military education you learn a lot about joint concepts and the theory behind joint warfare. Unless you have been exposed to this in a previous military job some the students may not be able to “visualize” what the lessons are covering. What OWS does is take what is taught in those lessons and puts it all together in a way where the students put all the moving parts together and then enables them to grasp the all of the classroom concepts. Another thing OWS does magnificently is to show the players how to blend different capabilities together to achieve their desired effects. When I play tested Zapad in March, we were able to work with the US Army wargamers to jointly roll back the enemy air defenses so we can get them close air support. Another reason why OWS is a great system is that the rules are easy to learn but tough to master, more on this later. Hobby Application Sadly, the game is only available from the US Marine Corps Association and is only available for offices in the DoD who conduct wargaming, so unless this changes you will probably not get your hands on a copy. Which then leads to the next question, could this be a viable game for the hobby market? I feel it could be a big hit if the game goes commercial, which as of now there are no plans for. The other question I bet you are thinking of is how would a hobby gamer do when playing the games in OWS system. For that I have to say “it depends”. In order to really understand the game, you need a real understanding of how joint warfare works and how different capabilities are used during a campaign. Even a military vet may not have the right amount of knowledge to play the game ‘well” and it would depend on their exposure of operational campaign planning or execution. Even with this said, I think OWS would be a good way to teach hobby gamers on how the joint force fights. Final Thoughts I think the team at USMCWL really has developed a sound game that may change how we wargame across the DoD. I am looking at ways in which I can use this game system for my “day job”. I also would love to see this game available for the commercial side of wargaming, I think grogs would just love to play this game.",

The commercial ones are usually centered on specific historic battles, and often follow a sort of \"script\" where things happen at specific turns e.g. the introduction of new units or weather conditions, that sort of thing. They seemed interesting, and I came away with two main observations: 1 - A game can take a very very long time. Turns might even take days or weeks on particularly elaborate ones. Thus there is a major time commitment during which you must leave the game out and setup for an extended period of time. 2 - My first thought when encountering these was \"why aren't they just using a computer?\". But I quickly learned that the ability to spread out a map, that might be many square meters, and see everything happening on it at once, without having to slide a monitor's viewport around (or zoom in and out) has a number of massive advantages -- and (at the time I was looking at this) there's really no display technology today that can replicate this. I feel like both of these observations have changed significantly with the advent of cheap, high-resolution, networked AR/VR headsets. I don't think I'd want to wear one entirely for the length of time a game might take, but we're much closer now to having truly digital versions of this that eliminate many of the downsides. reply defsectec 14 hours agoparentI'm pretty sure that these days the more modern military wargames done by legitimate organizations, that aren't physical simulations (a.k.a. laser tag for grownups), do use computers and have integrations with full-size flight sims and data analysis tools. I play game called Command: Modern Operation^¹ which can barely be a called a game, but rather a military command simulation at the operational level masquerading as one for civilian mil-sim nerds such as myself to toy around with. There is a \"Pro\" version^² with all sorts of data-analysis and integration with other equipment/software that, according to their website, used by a surprisingly long list of military organizations. In practice, I have no idea how much it actually is used as I don't work in the defense industry. I'm sure there are other tools out there like this, but this is the only one I've used before. If you like these kind of things I highly recommend it. It's the kind of game that comes with a 400pg ebook if that's your kinda thing. Personally, it tickles my autism just right.

You need a big table to leave it set up and play with a group that can get together regularly, but that is not different from running a RPG campaign. Today any group playing it is more likely to play it using (the open source tool) VASSAL (here is the free module to download to play CNA: https://vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:The_Campaign_for_North_...). I saw a thread on a wargame forum just a few weeks ago looking for players to start up a new game. Playing online probably makes it a bit more likely to be played (but also less fun than to gather around a huge table IRL?). (Aside: By tradition, an old \"gentlemens agreement\", between the wargaming community and wargame publishers, when playing a game online with VASSAL every player is expected to own a physical copy of the game. You are not supposed to download the CNA module to play it for free without owning the game. There is no DRM or other attempts to police who plays what, but as long as the system is not abused too much the publishers are happy and most keep allowing those tools to exist. It is a nice contrast to how copyright is handled elsewhere, including in more mainstream tools for playing online boardgames. I guess it is only possible in a small niche hobby like that, and possibly only because the tradition started last century before there was big money in selling digital versions of boardgames.) reply michaelt 4 hours agorootparent> You need a big table to leave it set up and play with a group that can get together regularly, but that is not different from running a RPG campaign. I think you might be under-estimating how long a 1500 hour game is. A person who works 8 hours a day works 2000 hours in the course of a year. And if the game's in-person, there's travel time - it's not like a computer game where you can do a 1-hour session every evening for 4 years. Even a the longest RPG adventures like \"Dungeon of the mad mage\" (famous for people getting bored without completing it) tend to be less than 500 hours. reply livrem 1 hour agorootparentThat is the modern (well, DnD 3E and later, so this century?) style of RPG campaign, with pre-packaged bundles of adventures to play in series, designed to last some specific time and then it ends. The traditional oldschool form of RPG campaign, still the way many groups play, and definitely the most common form last century (even if there were a few pre-packaged campaign modules for AD&D as well) is to create a group of characters and just keep playing adventure after adventure, more or less connected, replacing characters as they died off or players got bored with their current characters, but not really having a well-defined end, probably just fizzling out in the end as players drop off or the group decide to start a new campaign. https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/20/us/dungeons-and-dragons-l... (A bit extreme maybe, but I heard of shorter campaigns, but still lasting for at least a decade of regular play.) And I think you underestimate how dedicated some people can be to playing games like CNA. It is a big game, but it is not absurdly long compared to other big board wargames. Here is a BGG thread from 2010 (well before CNA became a mainstream meme?): https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/580214/ Note how the thread starts out \"25 years after playing my last game of CNA\". So called \"monster wargames\" was a trend around 1980, toward the sudden end of the era of board wargames being almost-mainstream. I do not know if CNA was the biggest of all, but I think not. It was part of starting the trend, but later games were probably bigger and longer. https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/42904/the-biggest-of-the-... reply BlueTemplar 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's a common issue in 4X games (in a much less extreme form of course), doesn't mean they aren't games, or even bad games.

And once players had started modifying the rules of Diplomacy to make it work under this new paradigm, it was a relatively short leap to begin making entirely new play-by-post games with new themes which shared some commonalities of approach with Calhamer’s magnum opus. > Thus in December of 1966, Dan Brannon announced a play-by-post game called Xeno, whose concept sounds very familiar indeed in the broad strokes.

At least one history book [2], has been written about the topic. However it is rare that these military training games make it outside of their domain and become available to the general public. A rare exception may be the games designed by Volko Ruhnke [3], who designed games for training the CIA (though these may not be war games per se, but rather games about complex geopolitical situations). Mr. Rhunke's experience led him to become a highly successful commercial game designer. [1]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegsspiel [2]. The Art of Wargaming: A Guide for Professionals and Hobbyists by Peter P. Perla (Author), R. Dawn Sollars (Illustrator) [3]. https://spyscape.com/article/meet-the-cia-spy-who-creates-wa... reply fbdab103 1 hour agoparentThe \"Wrens\" was a division of women Navy sailors who played WW2 war games to identify how German UBoats were so successful. Played many scenarios, and replayed events after attacks to understand German tactics. Would get called in to game out live events as they were happening to decide upon the next day's strategy. Arguably led to enormous increases in British naval effectiveness. One little writeup I could find on it: https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/real-li... . Little blurb from the page: The Game, as it was to become known, took over the top floor of the building, which came to look like a cross between a school gym and a child’s nursery. The floor was covered in linoleum and divided into painted sectors. On this make-believe ocean, the Wrens moved miniature convoys – model merchant ships and their battleship chaperones – according to directions given by the officers taking part in the exercise. But while the Wrens were permitted a bird’s eye view of the play area, the naval captains were allowed only occasional peeks through holes in canvas booths, arranged at the side of the playing field, positioned to recreate the limitations of visibility at sea. ...During the post-mortem that followed each game, all of the players would be treated to a bird’s eye view of the battle. The officers could at last see the tracks of the U-boats drawn on the floor in green chalk, set against the movements of their own ships drawn in white, and learn from the umpires whether or not they had managed to sink any submarines. Often, the officers would realise that they had made numerous dreadful mistakes during the Game, which might have resulted in the loss of their ships in earnest combat. reply livrem 11 hours agoparentprevI have quite a few books on this topic. Perla's was probably the first that I read and it is good, but to anyone interested in the topic I would first recommend Jon Peterson's \"Playing at the World\" (\"A History of Simulating Wars, People and Fantastic Adventures, from Chess to Role-Playing Games\"). It's a book about how D&D came to be and covers many topics, but the section on wargames is very well researched and detailed (and I enjoyed the rest of the book as well). My second recommendation is CG Lewin's \"War Games and their History\". It is a bit lighter on the history of military professional games, even if there is a chapter or two on that, but the chapters on non-professional wargames are amazing. The author has a personal collection of games going back to the 19th century and the book is full of photos and descriptions of obscure games that I really enjoyed reading about and that I never found in any other source. It covers games up to around 1950, so it does not get into any of the more well-known modern history of wargames (starting with Avalon Hill in the 1950's). reply pfdietz 16 hours agoparentprevThe Naval War College famously engaged in wargames in the interwar years.

I had never played a game involving so much back channel negotiation, double crossing, and strategy. It had a funny effect on water cooler conversations because folks that I had a great relationship with would approach me with a noticeable air of disappointment as a result of some of my less than honorable decision making. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a group of friends looking for a turn based war game spanning many days. reply the_af 15 hours agoprevIt may not be immediately obvious, but these are not \"games\" in the hobbyist sense of the word (though I suppose hobbyists may get interested, though access to this one in particular seems to be restricted to the military) but \"simulations\" for teaching and training. They are not supposed to be \"fun\". They are supposed to be analysis tools. Their goal is different to a wargame for hobbyists, where \"playability\" is usually a greater factor than the simulation of real war concerns. That's why it's OK that in a single day you can get one or two turns done. It's not a game, people who attend these exercises are doing work-related stuff. That's why it's also \"not in stores\". reply BlueTemplar 9 hours agoparentMultiple turns per day is faster than your typical 3+ players 4X PBEM game, here a recent example for Civilization : https://www.realmsbeyond.net/forums/showthread.php?tid=11199... reply the_af 3 hours agorootparentTrue.

I also don’t understand the point unless it’s mostly about face to face interaction. reply livrem 11 hours agoparentBack when I had more free time I played in some really long non-computer games like that. It was great to have a group that got together 1-2 evenings per week, played for a few hours to complete one or a few turns. The alternative is to get together and play for a long day or weekend, but many games are much too long for that. I played one earlier this month with six other players (in two teams). We started in the morning and played til late in the evening, but we did not get halfway through the game. It was enough to see what side was likely to win. That is the usual outcome in my experience. More common these days is to use a tool like VASSAL (https://vassalengine.org/) to play those games online. reply cl42 16 hours agoparentprevI believe in this case that's very much the goal -- less about who wins, and more about the options/tactics debated to inform actual military battle prep. reply ranger207 15 hours agoparentprev [–] It's about the face-to-face decision making and teambuilding. The lack of a computer is also somewhat of a bonus as it forces players to be intentional about processes, because in battle the computer probably won't be able to handle every process that comes up and so experience doing it by hand is useful reply chaostheory 13 hours agorootparent [–] I hope that they at the very least use a computer to calculate the outcomes of a battle. reply KineticLensman 8 hours agorootparent [–] > I hope that they at the very least use a computer to calculate the outcomes of a battle. From the article: The real core mechanic is how dice are used in the game. The dice act as an instant adjudicator and the system uses different sizes of dice that can be adjusted during game play. The map and counters also encode a lot of rapidly accessible state information. Using a computer would require all of this state info to be maintained in the computer, which would be a very different game, probably without the person to person interactions that make the game what it is. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

They will use it to train AI or derive some kind of privacy violating model from it. They might even use your cpu power and electricity for it. I'd love the governement to take a more powerfull stance against it, but they clearly aren't interested. If small you and me want some privacy, you have to shield it from the internet, govs and bigcos: No more Microsoft, Google, Adobe, .... products. [1] https://www.androidauthority.com/microsoft-ai-ceo-interview-... reply scosman 8 hours agoparentIt is possible to learn from private data while preserving privacy. Intro here (there are many other forms): https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/learning-with-pri... Lots of issues come with privatized ML though: - It's pretty close to impossible for a consumer to judge if the methods used are actually privacy preserving, or just lip service. It's just too technical. - It's much harder to implement than non-private learning. - Governments will likely not be able to regulate at the level of technical detail needed to allow privacy preserving, and not the non-private learning - You complain about using the consumers CPU/electricity, but that's often very helpful for privacy. The private alternative is taking DP data off the device, in which need to collect a lot more data for same privacy levels. reply try_the_bass 9 hours agoparentprevI think I kind of disagree on it being privacy-violating? They're training on data that you generated while using their product. It seems like they should have just as much right to it as you? Obviously you're free to disagree, but then you have to use another product or tool to accomplish the same work. Perhaps another one exists, but if you were using Figma, it might be because you believe it's a better tool than others. You're presumably using it to generate value for yourself, hopefully in excess of the amount of money you paid for it. Hopefully you think it's a good product and is worth what you're paying for it; otherwise why would you use it in the first place? Reading through this and some of the documentation on the AI features, it sounds like they want to use the data you generate in the product to make the product even easier to use, both for yourself and other potential users. If you want them to be able to do that, let them use your data for training. If you don't, don't. A company wanting to use your \"data\" doesn't seem fundamentally wrong? Or, it seems no different than you wanting to use their product to make value for yourself? I don't really see a problem with them opting folks in by default. It seems like it's pretty clearly documented, which feels compatible with informed consent when using the product. Realistically, making it an opt-in process would cause the vast majority of that data to be abandoned. Most people don't do anything with their \"data\", which seems pretty wasteful when looked at through that lens. reply mpweiher 9 hours agorootparent> They're training on data that you generated while using their product. It seems like they should have just as much right to it as you? Er...no? As in \"not even close\"? The maker of the typewriter Hemingway used has no rights to the works of Hemingway. The maker of the shovel has no rights to the ditch dug with it. The maker of my kitchen knives has no rights to the food I prepare with them. reply joelanman 8 hours agorootparentprevso if you wrote a book in Google docs, Google should have just as much right to it as you? Or Microsoft should have just as much right to the app you write in VS Code? reply rented_mule 1 hour agorootparentSaying Google has the same rights (including publication, etc.) as you do to your book written in Google Docs is certainly over the line. I can't speak for the grandparent, but I have to assume they didn't have this extreme in mind when writing their comment. The far more interesting question is, \"Where is the line?\" Is it okay for Google Docs to store your documents on Google's drives? If you want that product to exist, then it better be okay! What if Google analyzes font usage in all docs? No docs out of millions have ever used SillyFont, so they decide to remove SillyFont from the default list to declutter the interface. I don't think that's over the line. How about detecting that everyone is ignoring/undoing the spelling correction of a specific word and using that to realize they have a misspelling in their dictionary? I'd like that. How about noticing that your documents all use British spellings rather than American spellings (e.g., \"colour\" rather than \"color\"), so they adapt spell checking and autocompletion? Is that over the line? How about using everyone's text and location to build an ML classifier to determine that \"go on holiday\" is British and \"go on a vacation\" is American and using that to adapt autocompletion? What if 99% of all occurrences of the phrase \"It was a dark and\" end with \"stormy night\", so they autocomplete that? If you're writing your new book in Google Docs and I type the first five words, should it autocomplete the rest of your book for me? I think it's easy to agree this is over the line. Where is the line? I suspect we won't all agree. Is it possible to come up with somewhat standardized concepts and language around this, so that vendors can publish data usage policies that let consumers make informed decisions? reply StrLght 9 hours agorootparentprev> They're training on data that you generated while using their product.

No need for legislation reply ajay_san 10 hours agoparentprevI dont think a normal person (including me) would be able to read a zillion page TOS agreement. reply latexr 9 hours agorootparentAs a non-lawyer (is that what you mean by “normal person”?) who has read several TOS, here are some tips off the top of my head: 1. Use fewer services. This limits the amount you have to read or worry about changes. 2. Of the services you use, limit the personal information you provide. Disposable emails and making up names and birthdates (when they are mandatory) all help. Only do this for services where you don’t care if your account is closed. Particularly impactful for those services which make it a pain to delete an account. 3. Don’t read the full TOS. They are legal documents organised in logical sections so skip the fluff and go to the ones you care about like the handling of your data. As you read more TOS, you’ll become better at detecting the patterns and won’t need more than a couple of minutes to read what’s important to you. 4. The Privacy Policy is often more important than the TOS, regarding what will truly affect you. Start with that. 5. Always open TOS and Privacy Policy links, even if you’re not going to read them. You might be surprised to find how many of them are broken links. That’s usually the sign of a shadier company that you should skip. reply beezlewax 9 hours agorootparentA few vigilant people not using industry standard products is futile in the long run. There has to be legislation about this to have and real effect. reply latexr 9 hours agorootparentI agree. But your point is tangential to mine. My comment offers tips to those who think reading TOS is an insurmountable task (it isn’t), not commentary on why the current system is broken (it is, but I feel most people already agree on that). reply BiteCode_dev 9 hours agorootparentprevEven if it takes 10 minutes per ToS update per service, that's still a good 100 of hours in your entire life (this they don't provide diffs) just to do that. It should be illegal. reply latexr 9 hours agorootparent> Even if it takes 10 minutes per ToS update per service, that's still a good 100 of hours in your entire life That would mean 600 TOS, which means you’re not following points 1 and 2. Furthermore, as soon as you find anything objectionable, you stop reading. After the first couple of them you don’t need 10 minutes. > It should be illegal. There have been instances of unenforceable TOS, and some countries are pushing for contracts to have mandatory summaries of each section.

You can't have an opt-out if you want to sell data about the user - like name, email, browsing history, and that kind of stuff. Data created by the user - such as a youtube video, HN comment, or whatever you want to call Figma - is probably still a wild west. That's more about intellectual property than privacy. The ToS of pretty much every single platform has included a mandatory licensing clause for ages, giving them the rights to do pretty much everything they want to. reply matesz 9 hours agorootparent> That's more about intellectual property than privacy It is very important point and anybody who is working on something more innovative than few mockups for their next SaaS app is fuming from their ears. Just to illustrate let's consider a scenario where we have a team of scientists working for a long period of time on a data structure which they have visualised in their Figma project. Now let's say they forgot to turn the toggle off. In an instant all of their intellectual property earned through years of blood, sweat and tears is integrated into Figma's LLM. Just like that and without any attribution!!! reply joelanman 8 hours agorootparentprevthe problem is data created by the user can easily contain personal data reply jkaplowitz 10 hours agoparentprevYes it is, to the extent consent rather than legitimate interest is the legal basis or even under legitimate interest if the data meets the GDPR definition of sensitive. I suspect legitimate interest as the legal basis here would be legally invalid in this case, but it would not at all surprise me if Figma were to try to away with that argument. The GDPR is not actively enforced enough for compliance to be as widespread as it should be, especially by non-European companies but even by European companies. (I suspect that’s part of the reason lobbyists haven’t forced in more loopholes through legislative amendment; the EU and member-state politicians and regulators can look stronger on privacy than they are without actually severely impacting the corporate surveillance and advertising regimes.) reply Quothling 9 hours agoparentprev [–] I doubt it would be. Housing any form of data subject to GDPR or NIS2 on Figma is already against the EU directives. So any data you house on Figma isn't going to be sensitive in terms of privacy. So the title is a little misleading in that it's not personal privacy data, but whatever work you've used Figma for. Which wouldn't be protected by EU directives as such, because if it was, you would be the one breaking the law. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

This critical source of energy and morale was considered almost as vital as gunpowder; Union General Benjamin Butler ordered his soldiers to carry coffee with them always, saying it guaranteed success: “If your men get their coffee early in the morning, you can hold” your position. But by 1862, imports of coffee were down by 40 percent since the start of the war. Though coffee was cultivated around the world from Java to Ethiopia to Haiti, Brazil had been the main supplier to the United States. The Union blockade of Southern ports, including New Orleans, had slowed coffee imports from Brazil to a trickle—and Union merchants and military contractors were able to reroute only a portion of that Brazilian coffee northward; even with Union port cities trying to pick up the slack, the U.S. imported 50 percent less by value from Brazil in 1863 than it did in 1860. Demand, meanwhile, had quadrupled since the fighting began, fueled by a commitment to provide each Union soldier with a generous 36 pounds of coffee per year. Finding a new source of coffee had become a matter of survival. Luckily for the Union, Stephen Allen Benson, president of the relatively young Republic of Liberia, had a plan. In February 1862, he sent a message to Americans in the North: “In Liberia there are about 500,000 coffee trees planted … [and] there is now more coffee exported from Liberia than in any previous period.” Born in Maryland to free Black American parents, Benson had emigrated with his family to the West African colony at the age of 6. By the outbreak of the Civil War, in April 1861, he was one of the largest coffee farmers in Liberia—and he hoped that this new country, to which several thousand Black Americans had fled to escape American racial animus, could provide an essential fuel in the Union’s own fight against slavery. A ship that left the port at Monrovia in August 1862 carried 6,000 pounds of premium African coffee. It was the first major shipment to the Union—and would prove vital in the North’s victory. Coffee replaced tea as the U.S. drink of choice around the time of the American Revolution. From the moment patriots tossed chests of tea into Boston Harbor in December 1773, drinking coffee—and boycotting tea—became a sure sign of loyalty to the cause of independence. Pretty soon, the country was obsessed: By the 1830s, coffee consumption was outstripping tea by five to one. In 1832, Andrew Jackson replaced army alcohol rations with coffee, in hopes of energizing the troops and reducing instances of drunken insubordination. By 1860, the U.S. was importing six pounds of the stuff each year for every man, woman and child in the country—and at the outbreak of the Civil War, Americans were drinking twice as much coffee as they were 30 years before. But the war introduced a problem for the Union’s coffee drinkers. The sudden demand for more coffee as a crucial army provision combined with the blockade of the Southern ports created a crisis. What the Union could import was hardly enough to keep its army supplied, let alone to caffeinate Northern civilians in the manner to which they’d become accustomed. Born in Maryland, Stephen Allen Benson emigrated to Liberia, where he later became the nation’s president—and a major coffee grower. Library of Congress Yet there was a promising workaround: An early alliance between Northern abolitionists and the Liberian people had begun to bring small quantities of Liberian coffee to the North before the war. In 1848, before his presidency, Benson had formed a partnership with the Quaker merchant and activist George W. Taylor, whose “Free Labor Warehouse” in Philadelphia exclusively sold goods, food and clothes made without enslaved labor. Benson shipped roughly 1,500 pounds of coffee to Taylor that first year, and their partnership continued fruitfully throughout the next decade as they supplied coffee drinkers who were looking for slavery-free alternatives. Just as some consumers today boycott brands that trouble them, buy fair trade products and otherwise vote with their wallets, some abolitionists used commerce to fight slavery. Liberian coffee was especially attractive to the American Free Produce movement, with its explicit mandate of using ethical commerce to undermine the global slave trade. Coffee had long been championed by Quakers and other Free Produce advocates like Taylor. It was a product that free laborers could grow and that consumers could support with their purchases, even if it cost a little more to pay the farmers. At the time, the United States had not yet officially recognized the Republic of Liberia, and no formal trade treaties existed between the two countries. Southern states had stood in the way of recognizing Liberia since its independence in 1847, arguing that it would be inappropriate for the U.S. to host a Black diplomatic representative in Washington. But secession created an opening, and right away, Benson began lobbying the U.S. government to extend “treaties of friendship and commerce” that would allow Liberian farmers to bring in coffee on equal terms with other coffee-producing countries. By the start of 1862, Benson was not alone in his conviction that the farmers of Liberia could bolster the Union war effort. Mercifully for Union generals, President Abraham Lincoln officially recognized the republic that year and raised the tariff on coffee imports to 4 cents a pound as a war-funding effort. That created an opening for imports of Liberia’s more expensive, but also more ethical, coffee—now not so different in price from more established coffees like those from Java. Taylor’s Philadelphia Free Produce store expanded its network in Liberia, bringing new coffee to market from Liberian farmers like Othello Richards and Thomas Moore. The Union also sent advisers to Liberia, including Edward Morris, a Philadelphia merchant, who visited in 1862 to give free lectures to farmers about best practices for planting coffee—and to ask farmers what support they needed to increase the scale of this new coffee economy. His success was conspicuous. One Liberian settler, William C. Burke, who had been manumitted to emigrate to Liberia by Confederate General Robert E. Lee, wrote to his American contacts that after Morris’ visit, “the attention of almost every [Liberian] farmer has been lately turned towards raising coffee” for the U.S. market.

Library of Congress Newspapers from Maine to Ohio to California reported encouragingly on the supplies of Liberian coffee. On the ground, meanwhile, the Union’s ability to purchase and distribute coffee from Liberia, alongside other sources, was helping the army’s morale. In December 1862, one soldier wrote that “what keeps me alive must be the coffee.” The North was gaining a powerful caffeinated edge over the Confederacy, where importers, stymied by the Union’s ongoing blockade, were having far less success. Indeed, by 1863, coffee had become ludicrously scarce throughout the Confederacy. A Vermont soldier, marching through Louisiana, noted: “The richest planters have had no tea or coffe [sic] for over a year—when any poor coffe has been brought here it sold for $8 a pound.” In contrast, a receipt issued by Taylor’s Free Produce shop in Philadelphia in 1863 shows that he charged just 40 cents per pound for his prime Liberian beans, described by one arbiter to be of “superior” quality compared with non-Liberian coffee; one longtime Philadelphia customer extolled Liberian coffee’s “strength, flavor and aroma.” Confederate soldiers, huddled over their campfires in the predawn light, had to make do with unpalatable coffee substitutes brewed from acorn grounds, sweet potatoes and other dubious ingredients. Military discipline was reportedly difficult to maintain in the Confederate Army, where, one Union soldier noted, “they get no tea or coffee but plenty of whiskey.” One desperate Confederate soldier wrote a hastily scrawled, undated note to Union troops across the line in Fredericksburg, Virginia: “I send you some tobacco and expect some coffee in return … yours, Rebel.” The lack of coffee was fast eroding Confederate morale. An 1863 coffee package featured a nonchalant Uncle Sam seated on a cannon, whittling, with a torn Confederate flag under his foot. Library of Congress The Union Army acted decisively to press its caffeine advantage. At the end of August 1864, the Alexandria Gazette in Virginia lamented that the Union troops in Sherman’s siege of Atlanta had “destroyed 500 sacks of genuine Rio coffee” intended for Confederate consumption—about 55,000 pounds in all. At this point in the war, Union supplies of coffee, including those from Liberia, were so assured that Northern soldiers could even afford to destroy the Confederate stock rather than confiscate or consume it themselves. An article on the same front page of the Gazette noted that a ship had recently arrived in New York with “40,000 pounds of ‘Liberia-Mocha’ coffee.” Benson’s small individual contribution in 1864, around 220 pounds of coffee sold through Taylor’s Free Produce Warehouse that same year, would have been enough to supply six soldiers for the full final year of the war. At the Confederate surrender at Appomattox in April 1865, Michigan soldier William Smith noted that the Confederate soldiers present were licking their lips hopefully, with “a keen relish for a cup of Yankee coffee.” The end of the war and Benson’s much-mourned death in 1865—an Ohio newspaper noted his passing as a “great loss”—did not put a damper on Liberian coffee exports to the U.S., where, after the war, coffee from the republic was increasingly available far beyond Free Produce shops. For their part, Liberian farmers counted their trading partnership with the Union a success. The war had created a new and durable market for their coffee, thanks in part to cooperation with the Free Produce Movement. As more people tried Liberian coffee, they tended to become devoted to it. As one Yale University chemistry professor recorded at the time, “Its quality was so much superior to most coffee in common use in this country that I at once ordered a sample.” Coffea liberica, as it was officially dubbed in 1876, was not only delicious, but also resistant to diseases that affected other varieties, and it won Liberia plenty of new trading partners: By 1885, its annual exports to countries including Britain and Germany reached an impressive 800,000 pounds—and then, only seven years later, a whopping 1.8 million. The U.S. coffee market, in turn, was forever changed by the war. Indeed, Smithsonian curator of political history Jon Grinspan says that drinking coffee three times a day had hooked America’s soldiers, with the enlisted men “developing lifelong peacetime habits while camped at Shiloh or Petersburg.” By 1885, the U.S. was importing 11 pounds of coffee per person, per year—nearly double prewar levels. Some news reports from this period—written, perhaps, after a third or fourth cup of Liberian brew—sometimes described coffee as a universal remedy, even touting its alleged benefits as a disinfectant. And in 1880, after the end of Reconstruction, with many reformers turning their attention from racial justice to temperance, the Philadelphia Times expressed the hope that “coffee houses would yet win the victory over gin palaces.” With the help of the prolific Liberian coffee plant, nothing seemed out of reach. Coffee Talk Manic birds, excitable goats and other invigorating tales behind the birth of our java addiction By Sonja Anderson Originating in Ethiopia, the shrub Coffea arabica is believed to be the first coffee plant cultivated. It is now grown in high-elevation tropical climates around the world. Alamy Get your goat According to legend, a ninth-century Ethiopian shepherd named Kaldi noticed his goats acting hyper after eating berries from a strange tree. He harvested some for himself and, upon consuming them, enjoyed a similarly energizing effect. Kaldi shared his zippy discovery with some nearby monks, who disapprovingly threw the berries into a fire—accidentally roasting their seeds, which we call beans. The fragrant beans were scooped from the coals, crushed, and soaked in water—creating the first cup of joe. Sea fare Ethiopians took nourishment from the coffee shrub in various ways: brewing its leaves and berries into tea, grinding and mixing the seeds with animal fat, or simply chewing on them. Some say that enslaved Northeast Africans—captured and forced across the Red Sea during a 1,300-year period of slave trade that began in the seventh century—may have carried such sustaining snacks onto ships, accidentally transporting the crop to another region that calls itself the birthplace of coffee: Yemen. Early birds In a different account, a 13th-century Moroccan mystic named Sheikh al-Shadhili saw a flock of amped-up birds soaring overhead, chewing unfamiliar-looking berries as they flew. After munching on some of the morsels the birds had dropped, Shadhili felt strangely alert—and he formed a habit. Energy for days Yemen’s coffee origin story credits one of Shadhili’s disciples: Omar, a healing priest once exiled from the town of Mocha for moral transgressions. Stranded in the hills, nearly starving, Omar plucked some red berries from a shrub. Finding the raw fruits’ seeds inedibly bitter, he opted to cook them over a fire, which hardened them beyond edibility. To correct this mistake, Omar boiled the roasted seeds, watching while the water turned brown and sweetly fragrant. Omar drank the dark liquid and, it is said, enjoyed days of sustained energy.

It's interesting that this went all the way to 1800s for the US. After reading Your Mind on Plants [1], I decided to do an experiment, and stop any caffeine intake for ~3 months. After ~1 month, I felt \"normal\". Only when you cannot rely on a drug, a clutch, you realize how many pressures you face every day. One might have a deadline, something doesn't work, some part of work is boring... Maybe you just slept badly. Coffee fixes all of those. Nothing is free though, and soon, you'll discover your sleep is not the best pretty much every day of the week. That, in turn, forces you to consume more caffeine, and thus the addiction cycle begins. Interestingly, after being 3 months caffeine free, I succumbed to the pressure and started drinking some amount of caffeine again (work needs to be done, caffeine makes it easier to concentrate -> it's really difficult to say no). I would encourage everyone to examine their relationship with this particular drug. It's insane to me that the population in 1800s was already so addicted to the drug that the lack \"plugs\" threaten to lose the civil war. [1] https://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Plants-Michael-Pollan/dp/05... reply crazygringo 1 hour agoparent> Coffee fixes all of those. The thing is, it only does for a few days. At least for me. Then the coffee isn't helping at all -- it's just keeping you at the same baseline you previously were at with coffee. I used to drink coffee all the time at just a constant level. Then I just got tired of feeling \"dependent\" on something and weaned off over a couple of weeks. Which was fine when you don't do it cold turkey -- just a little less energy each day but easily manageable. Now I still drink coffee sometimes but I use it as a temporary performance tool. I'll \"start up again\" on any particular day where I have a ton of meetings, where I didn't get enough sleep, where I have to do a lot of physical stuff, etc. Often this might be several days in a row, where I increase my coffee each day a little more relative to the previous day for the same effect. But then as soon as the demands stop, I immediately taper off to zero again, usually taking 2-5 days to do so. Not really because I \"don't want to be dependent\", but because I want to make sure I can get the full effect of coffee again the next time I need it, whether that's in a week or a month or three months. It's kind of weird that I'm always fully aware of exactly how much I'm \"dosing\" myself with coffee. I'm almost always either \"tapering up\", \"tapering down\", or just off of it completely. But it's very effective as a tool that way. Way more effective than when I just drank the same amount every day, which I discovered was no different from not drinking any at all (after tapering off). reply fhub 34 minutes agorootparentI stop consuming caffeine 2 days before a holiday and preemptively take acetaminophen for a day to prevent any headaches. Then no caffeine on the holiday. I sleep more, relax more and just generally more chilled. I sometimes try to stay off it a bit after the holiday but rarely lasts long. reply crazygringo 27 minutes agorootparentJust a question -- are you entirely sure your acetaminophen pill doesn't also contain caffeine? Just since that's an extremely common combination, and I wasn't aware of acetaminophen on its own being able to counter the effects of a caffeine-withdrawal headache. I'm fascinated if this actually works. reply Log_out_ 5 minutes agorootparentprevlike running a ship aground on the rocks of a riff,coffein provides a few waves that get you further inland before the wreck comes to an halt reply Arn_Thor 3 hours agoparentprevFor me it’s not that clear cut.

When my head hits the pillow at night I’m out and sleep without any interruption. There was a point a long time ago where I wasn’t under control, and in an effort to rein it in I quit for two months. It was awful. I struggled to concentrate and felt no real benefit from being “clean”. I decided to set limits and started up again. That blast of caffeine in the morning is all it takes to set my brain on the right path the rest of the day. My theory is that people who end up struggling with caffeine, do so because they equate more caffeine with being even more productive. If you treat it like you would a (enjoyable) medicine, you can have the best of all worlds. reply woleium 1 hour agorootparentI did the same, but then transitioned to 10 mins of vigorous exercise instead in the morning.

Same with me. > It’s only when I’m pressured to go beyond that I suffer What I discovered was that If I gradually increase my consumption, then it doesn't cause any issues. There was a point where I'd drink my 4 or 5th cup of coffee very close to bed time and still get a good night of sleep. But the key was to gradually build up to that point. I drink 2 or 3 cups now (mainly because I can no longer consume coffee after large meals, and OMAD at night is no longer sustainable). reply nunez 3 hours agoparentprevI did the same back in December...while I was undergoing sleep compression during my CBT for insomnia treatment. Withdrawal on hard mode! What motivated me to do so was trying a single origin decaf that my local roaster had available and realizing that, yes, decaf coffee can taste like regular coffee! I literally decided to stop drinking caffeinated coffee after that first cup. Things were rough for about a month but all good after that. The nice thing about drinking decaf every day is that caffeine _really_ works when I do choose to use it. Super helpful while driving long distances. reply jorvi 1 hour agorootparentDecaffeinated coffee’s main problem isn’t that it tastes bad, it’s that it goes stale incredibly quickly. You’ll have to consume a steady amount of coffee each day if you want to finish your supply on time. Or purchase only small amounts. reply _DeadFred_ 6 minutes agorootparentI thought the main problem was that it's made with the same chemicals used to do dry cleaning. reply anonymouskimmer 3 hours agorootparentprev> The nice thing about drinking decaf every day is that caffeine _really_ works when I do choose to use it. And how. reply zeta0134 5 hours agoparentprevI went on a similar caffeine experimentation journey, and eventually settled on one (1) cup of coffee in the morning, followed by usually plain water for the rest of the day. I appreciate the boost to \"get a task started\" willpower that the caffeine provides, and by limiting my intake, it's mostly flushed out of my system by the time I'm ready to sleep. For my body, this balance seems to work well: I sleep deeply, dream vividly, and am occasionally woken by nightmares. (always wasps.) Usual stuff. Ideally I'd avoid caffeine entirely, but when I tried to sustain this (for over a year) I felt lethargic and fatigued more often than not. From a willpower perspective, it was far too easy to go, \"I'm too tired to start this task right now, I'll put it off.\" Some of that is mental, I realize, but the quick fix won. I have stuff to do and I don't want to spend months in misery trying to force a major lifestyle change when the coffee is right there. What I *cannot* do anymore is drink caffeine (in any form) all day long, like I used to when I was younger. I have no idea how I slept at all. I'm partly convinced I mostly did not, and in hindsight it explains a lot of weird sleep consistency issues I was constantly struggling with. reply Nathanba 3 hours agorootparentSame journey for me, sadly I don't think drinking coffee consistently is the perfect answer. No matter what amount I drink it either becomes too little (because I adapt) or too much (Far worse sleep, somewhat depressive, can't work out or jog anymore because of heart fluttering, only truly feel good for ~4-5h per day, then worse all day). I think the only theoretical way to consistently get value out of coffee is to drink it during the work week and then force myself to withdraw on the weekend so my body always has a fresh response to it. The reason why I don't like this either is because I obviously lose two entire days of my life to feeling pretty bad per week and you still eventually start drinking more because it's inevitable. Now what I remember seeing over the years is that whenever somebody would mention that they don't drink coffee and that person is still a high performer then they always seemed to be really into fitness and sports. Maybe this is the only way, using physical exercise as a stimulant instead of coffee. reply mirsadm 27 minutes agorootparentCaffeine is great for working out. I have a coffee before running or lifting weights. It's also usually included into lots fitness oriented supplements. reply mirsadm 2 hours agorootparentprevIf you feel tired and lethargic without coffee than to me that is a bigger problem to solve. I find the view on coffee here so strange. If I don't drink coffee I still get up and go for a run, I can still do everything just the same. My performance at work is the same. I drink it because I enjoy the taste and that's where it ends. reply BossingAround 2 hours agorootparent> I drink it because I enjoy the taste and that's where it ends. Coffee is a very bitter drink. I don't know you of course, but my guess is that what you like more is the dopamine caffeine releases in your brain, which you've now associated with the taste. You can try and experiment with good decaf coffee to see if it is actually the taste that you like. reply jameshart 1 hour agorootparentA strange sentiment. Do you think in general people can’t like ‘bitter’ flavors? Bitterness is very loosely defined in general - we know what ‘sweet’ and ‘salt’ are; bitterness is sometimes associated with some sort of acidity, but a lot of people seem to just describe things that have strong flavor but lack sweetness as ‘bitter’. Lemon, chocolate, kale, and red wine are all sometimes described as ‘bitter’ and they have virtually no common flavor compounds. It’s definitely possible to like the taste of coffee. My evidence for this is that when I drink coffee that tastes bad, I don’t like it as much. reply denton-scratch 1 hour agorootparentAcidity causes things to taste sour, not bitter. Bitterness is associated with alkaloids (many alkaloids are poisonous, so the fact we have taste-buds for bitterness is an advantage). I experience lemons as both sweet and sour, but certainly not bitter. [Edit] Perhaps the peel is bitter; the white pulp is certainly bitter. reply mirsadm 30 minutes agorootparentprevI drink decaf in the afternoon. Otherwise I'll have an Americano with a little bit of milk at least twice a day. I'll happily drink espresso and filter coffee though. Personally I don't find well made coffee bitter at all. reply klyrs 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you like coffee, dark chocolate, grapefruit, kale, arugula, etc., you might just love bitter flavors. Many people cut their coffee with milk and sugar to complement the bitterness. But then they typically enjoy the resulting flavor, too. I've known plenty of people who loved caffeine but not coffee. They drink soft drinks or take caffeine pills. Believe people when they say they like the flavor of coffee. reply srid 3 hours agoparentprevSince it has now become fashionable to give up on coffee, it would be refreshing to hear anecdotes from \"the other side\" as well -- people who drink plenty of coffee, throughout the day, but do not suffer from significant negative side-effects (i.e., they continue to get good sleep, have low stress, etc.) reply swaginator 57 minutes agorootparentThe parent comment's experience does not reflect my relationship with coffee at all. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, never medicated for it. Just regulated with diet and exercise, also probably self-medicated with caffeine and nicotine in college. Quit nicotine because of the very obvious health problems that come with it, I found it very easy to quit interestingly enough (thank God I quit before the Zyndemic). But I have never felt that coffee comes with any negative side effects for me other than anxiety. It doesn't affect my sleep unless I drink it past 5 PM, and I've never felt like it \"wakes me up\", it just lets me enter a hyperfocus state a lot more easily. Other people describe their relationship with coffee that they wake up and feel groggy, so they take coffee to have a baseline. For me it has never been about waking up, it's just something that helps with focus. I do get the jitters when drinking coffee especially since I eat my first meal very late in the day (12pm), so I switched to mate cocido, which is just mate in tea bags. The effect of even very strongly-brewed mate is far less pronounced than the effect of coffee, and I would even go so far as to say that whatever benefits I think I am getting from mate is probably just placebo. For reference during college I probably consumed 3-4 cups of coffee a day, then as I started working I would consume 5-6 cups a day, black. Now I stop drinking coffee after I eat at noon, so I am down to 2-3 cups a day. Also I think that brewing methods matter. Hot-brewed coffee causes less jitters and more focus. Cold-brewed coffee tastes better but it is easy to overshoot what feels like a \"therapeutic dose\" and actually end up making it harder to focus, as well as more jitters. It might be that I usually have hot coffee black, and I have cold brew with a bit of milk and simple syrup. The sugar or coldness might also make me colder or do something with my blood sugar, not sure. reply denton-scratch 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't drink a lot of the stuff, but I haven't quit. I used to drink about a litre of brewed coffee a day, starting at 7AM and going on until 5PM. Eventually that fell away, without any decision on my part, and I now drink one mug a day (1/2 imperial pint), after getting up. It doesn't seem to power me up or make me more alert; I think it actually makes me dozy, 2-3 hours after my morning joe. That is, I think I only notice the crash. reply bodhi_mind 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople want to find the secret to living with joy in their lives. Someone who “quits caffeine” has enough mindfulness to have noticed something wasn’t quite right in their life and they had the courage to try and change it. That mindset right there is the key to reducing stress. It’s not caffeine (unless you’re consuming a lot), it’s a perspective and framing thing. Daily coffee ritual can absolutely be a part of a routine that has been having negative affects on your state of mind, but it’s much more complex than “caffeine is a drug and it’s bad for you”. reply luzojeda 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't consider I drink _\"plenty\"_ of coffee throughout the day but I can't remember the last day I went without some form of caffeine. On average I take 1 cup in the morning with some milk and sometimes mate or black tea, both of which have caffeine as well, in the afternoon... plus Coke or other caffeinated drinks as well here and there. Ok maybe it could be plenty for some people, but for me 4 cups a day would be plenty lol. Maybe caffeine doesn't affect me much to this point and that's why I don't have any problem sleeping. I doze off 10' after putting my head on the pillow. Now regarding stress... comparing myself to the people around me I'd say I have normal levels of it. But most of those people consume caffeine daily so it's hard to have an objective measure. I'd like to carry out the experiment of going 15 days without caffeine to see if stress decreases though but it would be very hard considering how ingrained the substance is in our lives, even the social aspect. Mate for example is a drink which we usually share here in Argentina. You could maybe call it a ritual and a way of social bonding. And I like how it tastes too, of course. Add that to all the times you meet with people \"for a coffee and chat\", for example. reply gambiting 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't know if it's a lot, but I drink 3 cups a day, with the last one usually around 6pm, and I don't have any trouble going to sleep around 10-11pm, usually fall asleep the second I put my head down(but then I never had any issues going to sleep). reply BossingAround 2 hours agorootparentGoing to sleep is the easy part. The quality of your sleep is the thing :) The biggest problem is that you don't know how good/bad your sleep is, unless you make some changes to your lifestyle (e.g. starting or stopping with coffee). reply pirates 2 hours agorootparentprevthis is me, I drink about a pot per day and sometimes drink caffeinated soda with food. only a small amount of half and half in the coffee. my sleep schedule is pretty routine, hardly ever stay up past 11:30 and wake up naturally with no alarm between 6:30 and 8 every morning. it is noticeable if i don’t have a cup at least at some point during the day but there are plenty of days i don’t have as much or hardly at all. but i just like the warmth and how it tastes, the caffeine is a non factor if i decide to have a cup or not. other things that are probably significant factors: low stress job at a small private company where i don’t really have hard deadlines or deliverables and WFH as much as i want; wife and pets but no kids; low stress otherwise is areas of my life reply lc9er 1 hour agorootparentprevI’ve quit caffeine for 3-4 months. Aside from a rough few days from quitting cold-turkey, there was zero discernible difference in my day to day life. I enjoy black coffee, and the drawbacks, compared to say, soda or alcohol consumption are minimal, so I started drinking it again because I missed it.

I try to avoid drinking it after 7pm though. I don't drink alcohol more than a couple times per month, if that much. If I skip a couple cups I will get a headache, it's very predictable. reply systems_glitch 4 hours agoparentprevI think this is really understated. After developing a facial twitch and realizing I was consuming more than 1000 mg of caffeine a day, I switched to decaf once the particular project was over. No one told me it's physically addictive and has withdrawal symptoms! It's the only thing that would keep me functional and able to drive on with a project though. reply swaginator 53 minutes agorootparent> It's the only thing that would keep me functional and able to drive on with a project though. Don't you think that part of this could be stress? Also potentially dehydration. I have had eye twitches a couple times during long road trips where I drank Red Bull or Monster to keep focused, and was not drinking enough water. But I have never had twitching from caffeine under normal circumstances, since I usually drink 2 parts water for every part caffeinated drink (lots of bathroom breaks). reply systems_glitch 42 minutes agorootparentProbably not, I drink a lot of water, especially during hot weather -- I walk to work and back twice a day no matter the weather. reply chronogram 3 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you go from extremely high intake to decaf, or do you mean to not go back to using caffeine for your next project? For me a 200mg tablet in the morning works well, more doesn't give me more benefits and by bedtime a lot or most has gone. reply systems_glitch 1 hour agorootparentI had no idea there was withdrawal, and I have no psychological addiction to it, so I just switched to decaf not thinking anything of it, other than that I'd probably be more tired for a while. reply brightball 4 hours agorootparentprevMy wife and I switched to decaf about 6 months ago and we are pretty happy with it. Generally sleeping better and I can have 2-3 cups throughout my morning without going off the rails. reply systems_glitch 4 hours agorootparentOh I can drink a quart or two of regular coffee and still sleep like a rock, not get the jitters, etc. Pretty much my mom's entire side of the family is like that. Switching to decaf got rid of the facial twitch, but even after two months (in between projects) I was basically completely ineffective at even personal projects. I told the doctor about it and it's apparently likely I have adult ADHD. reply wombat-man 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah I used to just drink coffee or energy drinks all day. Now I'm sticking to one in the morning and a less caffeinated drink in the afternoon and my days are going a lot better. reply moomoo11 4 hours agoparentprevI stopped caffeine. It sucked for a week, and I’d taken a week off because I knew it would be hell. And it was. But after a week I felt free. I barely consume caffeine anymore, like if I’m with friends at a cafe or something. Otherwise I don’t make tea or coffee at home unless I have guests who want some. Some results I’ve noticed is that I literally don’t give a shit anymore about any pressures. I’ll just #dealwithit and it’s fine. I also sleep way better and I am able to utilize the full waking day (I wake up at 6am and I sleep at 10pm). One thing that’s strange is that it seems caffeine no longer has much effect like it used to in the rare occasion I’ll have a coffee. I’m able to sleep just fine and I feel no burst of energy or anything. Just a warm drink so maybe it warms me up a bit when it’s cool. Idk. 10/10 would recommend quitting caffeine.

After I got through the withdrawal, I basically found myself sitting at my desk and waiting to die. reply bdjsiqoocwk 5 hours agoparentprevI was 100% caffeine free for a year and a half while keeping a demanding full time job. That eventually ended when COVID lockdowns started (it's unclear even to me what the relationship between the two was; maybe my subconscious used it as an inspector excuse to go back) Caffeine doesn't seem to affect my sleep until I get to absurd amounts like 10 cups in a day, which some times it does happen. Currently I love the drug and intend to keep using it. reply nradov 5 hours agoparentprevA lot of people such as Mormons manage to bear capitalism just fine without caffeine. I like to have a little coffee most days but let's not exaggerate it's necessity. reply systems_glitch 4 hours agorootparentIt is a common misconception that Mormons are not allowed to consume caffeine, the limitation is actually on \"hot drinks,\" which is interpreted as having meant tea and coffee specifically in the time it was written down. They still drink soda and other heated drinks such as wassel, hot chocolate, and postum (a morning coffee substitute most folks find absolutely disgusting). (we live near a de facto Mormon college and pester our neighbors, who are largely Mormon professors, about such things) reply CommieBobDole 3 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that it changed in 2012 - the church released a statement then saying that the prohibition only applied to coffee and tea.

The Republican coalition of religious conservatives and business has its origins in the Civil War, where northern industry joined forces with fundamentalist Christians who opposed slavery. A quarter of all union soldiers were immigrants, mostly poor German immigrants. Iowa sent more volunteers (per capita) to fight for the union than any other state. What motivated all those people to fight and die in a war between British people? They had no personal stake in the war—they didn’t have industry powered by southern resources like cotton, nor were any battles fought anywhere near their homes. For them, fighting for the union was about vindicating a religious opposition to slavery. It was the confederates that portrayed themselves as being on the side of “science” against religious “zealots.” https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/cornersto.... To make sense of that, put yourself in 1861. That was more than a century before we had the technology to determine that humans are genetically all the same. If you were someone who looked at the world—what people had built in Africa and what they had built in Europe—and said “these people are all the same,” that was a statement of faith. reply 3 hours agorootparentnext [2 more] [dead] rayiner 2 hours agorootparentRace realists would do well to remember that, if you were a Mediterranean or Asian a couple of thousand years ago, the empirical evidence would have persuaded you that Northern Europeans were a lesser race: https://elfinspell.com/PrimarySource54BCCicero.html.

Perhaps Mormons have in their belief system a strong motivating stimulant? I am trying to avoid use of the word drug here as it is pejorative. Perhaps, Coffee is just what we need to overcome the ennui and pointless of modern existence and a set of religious (or cultural) beliefs helps us do the same. This would also imply that Caffeine consumption is lower in societies that are religious and have strong belief systems - religious or cultural, which can be tested! reply Arn_Thor 3 hours agorootparentI’d venture that Mormons (and SDAs, with which I’m more familiar) have more close knit (Caucasian) communities for generations that support each other and have elevated their collective socioeconomic status.

Cigars and pipes are more nuanced and far less harmful (especially because of the chemicals that aren't added, and the fact that you don't inhale) reply TeaBrain 2 hours agorootparentBoth Ulysses S Grant and Grover Cleveland were heavy consumers of cigars. Both ended up with oral cancer. reply TimTheTinker 1 hour agorootparentHot smoke in general causes cancer. Wood smoke (from fireplace, bonfire, etc.) is more carcinogenic per unit than pure (non-cigarette) tobacco smoke. There's a stronger link between regular wood fireplace use and cancer than there is between moderate pipe/cigar use and cancer. So moderate (not heavy like Grant) cigar and pipe smoking ought to be regarded as within the realm of acceptable risk, especially given the enjoyment and mental benefits that result. But if we're going to discuss carcinogens, a lot of other things ought to be considered too. For example, why isn't alcohol, a known carcinogen, considered socially taboo compared to pipe smoking? Why are burning wood fireplaces considered \"a nice touch\" when the second-hand smoke from them is far more dangerous than that from an outdoor cigar user nearby? reply TeaBrain 23 minutes agorootparentI'm not trying to convince you or anyone else to never smoke cigars. I just think that it is fair to make the point that cigars are not necessarily entirely safe, even if the relative risk for lung cancer is less than for cigarettes. I didn't even necessarily even make this point, as with my previous comment, I simply made two separate statements, and you came to a possibly implied conclusion yourself. Regardless of the safety of cigars, I fail to see the logic behind how the idea that the relative risk of wood smoke compared to cigar smoke is supposed to convince anyone that cigar smoke should seem safe, considering that wood fires are no longer commonly used to heat homes in the developed world. Indoor smoke from heating and cooking has been well-established as a carcinogenic risk, but people not using wood to heat nor using smoke-point inducing temperatures when cooking, do not regularly expose themselves to these risks. Also, I never claimed that alcohol did not increase carcinogenic risk. I make no position on that. However, given the proposition that alcohol is a carcinogen, then as cigars use is not mutually exclusive to alcohol use, and as smoking cigars incurs some carcinogenic risk, then for users of cigars and alcohol, cigar use would be an additive risk along with the risk incurred by alcohol use. reply op00to 1 hour agorootparentprevNo, there is no safe amount of cigar consumption. “Consistent data from all identified cohort and case-control studies indicate a significantly elevated risk for oral and pharyngeal cancer associated with cigar use, with evidence of a dose-dependent relation. Coupled with biologic mechanisms that likely are very similar to those involved in cigarette-related carcinogenesis, the available evidence strongly supports the conclusion that cigar use is a cause of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx.” This is one of many negative health effects from cigar consumption, including overall mortality, cardiovascular disease, lung, bladder, and head/neck cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and periodontal disease risk. You can evaluate your own risk, but tobacco consumption seems like there is no “safe” amount of consumption according to broad literature reviews. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK586217/ reply TimTheTinker 1 hour agorootparent\"Medically safe\" and \"acceptable risk\" are very different terms with different meanings. The medical establishment also says there's no safe amount of alcohol use, but that doesn't stop people from (rightly, I believe) enjoying a beer or glass of wine every now and then. The medical establishment's obsession with harm/risk reduction to the extreme is hazardous to human flourishing, in my opinion. We all have to come to terms with our eventual death to make the most of the life we have. I think the medical establishment is more motivated by insurance policy profits than by a desire to promote human flourishing. Joy and friendship and enjoyment and gratitude (etc.) are far better for our well-being than minimization of harm. reply lukan 1 hour agorootparentprev\"So moderate cigar and pipe smoking ought to be regarded as within the realm of acceptable risk\" I believe that you have the right to come to this personal conclusion, but I do not think it is true, as a general statement.

They are not used for normal day-to-day training. They are used reasonably heavily on deployments and international flights, to keep you sharp in these situations (Sudden combat after a long uneventful air patrol, or just fighting drowsiness while crossing the ocean and needing to mid-air refuel for the 5th time etc.) No-go pills (eg ambien) are also common on deployments, mainly to deal with shift changes, or dealing with sunlight affecting the circadian rythm. Use is up to the individual. I found that Dex has a severe impact on my sleep, even when taking 14+ hour prior. It is a very effective mental performance enhancer and obliterates exhaustion IMO, if you don't develop a tolerance. Ie, if you have available when flying, and take only when needed. Rule of thumb: Always fly with dex available, but only take when needed. Never have ambien anywhere in the cockpit, or you risk mixing them up. reply toast0 2 hours agorootparent> They are not used for normal day-to-day training.

It is highly unlikely that it has no effect on one's decision making (esp. when you take it when you are _not_ very tired). It's more likely that you don't notice the effects, but the effects would likely be measurable. It's the same with caffeine. I'd wager a guess that most people don't think it influences their decision making... And yet it seems it does (e.g. [2]). [1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/... [2] https://www.freethink.com/health/does-caffeine-harm-your-dec... reply reaperman 3 hours agorootparentprevModafinil increases my risk-taking behavior much more than amphetamine does, though otherwise has much lower physical side effects than amphetamine. Took me awhile to realize I was being incredibly flirty due to modafinil. It was typically well-received and it took me a long time to realize that it was modifying my behavior. But once I knew what to look for I saw the modifications across wide parts of my life including work and personal goals. Generally made me take on more ambitious goals. Eventually I suffered some traumatic events and modafinil started causing anxiety, especially when mixed with caffeine, and I found vyvanse was better after that for managing my ADHD without quite as much paralyzing anxiety. Everyone’s brain reacts very differently to each stimulant. On the very rare occasion that I take cocaine I usually just fall asleep and enjoy a hard nap! I don’t experience about 90% of the effects my friends report from it. Caffeine keeps me awake all night long even if I have just half of a cup of coffee any time after 11AM, and increases my anxiety to the point where it’s very difficult to be productive. Dextroamphetamine and Vyvanse both affect work productivity similarly for me but dextroamphetamine shuts down my social interaction, whereas Vyvanse increases it. This is particularly strange because they “should” be the exact same active drug once the Vyvanse is metabolized. Biology is still very much being discovered and there is a lot that we just don’t know yet. reply bryanrasmussen 4 hours agorootparentprevI remember reading a study on modafinil that found people on modafinil for a couple days when giving directions where apt to be irritable and not throwing in identifying details. so a modafinil user \"Go three blocks that way, turn left, go two blocks turn left again, turn right immediately\" non-modafinil user \"Go that way until you see the Circle-K, turn left, then it's two blocks where you have to turn left again, the street name is something like Majors way, and then the first time you can turn after that you turn right - there's a large drawing of a man drinking coffee on the side of the building\" on edit: unfortunately no idea where I read this but that was a big let-down for me as it implied there was perhaps no such thing as a free ride.

Kind of puts both into perspective reply PopAlongKid 5 hours agoparentprevThe animated show \"Archer\" (action/comedy TV series) season 9 episode 7 had this as a plot point. From the IMDB trivia section: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7576240/trivia/ \"Pervitin was one of the first commercially available formulations of methamphetamine hydrochloride (salts); it also contained large doses of caffeine. It was used by Nazi soldiers, sometimes along with cocaine, to help them remain alert on night patrols, long marches and also to help increase aggression and stamina during battle. Pervitin was heavily used by Stuka (a German fighter plane) pilots to help keep them alert on long patrol flights, hence the nickname \"Stuka tablets\". By 1940 the German Army had started greatly reducing the number of tablets each solider was allowed to have due to the severe side effects. While the drug was in their system, it had the benefit of causing decreased fear and increased strength, stamina, aggression and gave them a high resistance to pain. However, after the drug wore off, soldiers often took several days to recover. They suffered from a form of amphetamine \"hangover\" and were pretty much useless for the next few days because they acted more like zombies than soldiers; this was mainly because of the long duration of methamphetamine's effects which would cause soldiers to be awake for a few days straight, so it would take several days for the body to recover. Pervitin use also was responsible for Nazi soldiers becoming too aggressive and attacking fellow soldiers and superior officers. It also caused some to commit war crimes by killing civilians and raping women and young girls as amphetamines often greatly increase libido and decrease inhibitions.\" reply jordanb 4 hours agoparentprevThis podcast talks about Nazi drug use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3_3aUKfLoI One of the takeaways is that meth works ok during fast blitz campaigns like Poland or France where you want to get the whole thing over in a few weeks at most.

    "originBody": "Login Search Search Startups Venture Apple Security AI Apps Events Startup Battlefield More Close Submenu Fintech Cloud Computing Layoffs Hardware Google Microsoft Transportation EVs Meta Instagram Amazon TikTok Newsletters Podcasts Partner Content Crunchboard Jobs Contact Us AI MIT robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks thinks people are vastly overestimating generative AI Ron Miller 8:00 AM PDT • June 29, 2024 Comment Image Credits: Paul Marotta / Getty Images When Rodney Brooks talks about robotics and artificial intelligence, you should listen. Currently the Panasonic Professor of Robotics Emeritus at MIT, he also co-founded three key companies, including Rethink Robotics, iRobot and his current endeavor, Robust.ai. Brooks also ran the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) for a decade starting in 1997. In fact, he likes to make predictions about the future of AI and keeps a scorecard on his blog of how well he’s doing. He knows what he’s talking about, and he thinks maybe it’s time to put the brakes on the screaming hype that is generative AI. Brooks thinks it’s impressive technology, but maybe not quite as capable as many are suggesting. “I’m not saying LLMs are not important, but we have to be careful [with] how we evaluate them,” he told TechCrunch. He says the trouble with generative AI is that, while it’s perfectly capable of performing a certain set of tasks, it can’t do everything a human can, and humans tend to overestimate its capabilities. “When a human sees an AI system perform a task, they immediately generalize it to things that are similar and make an estimate of the competence of the AI system; not just the performance on that, but the competence around that,” Brooks said. “And they’re usually very over-optimistic, and that’s because they use a model of a person’s performance on a task.” He added that the problem is that generative AI is not human or even human-like, and it’s flawed to try and assign human capabilities to it. He says people see it as so capable they even want to use it for applications that don’t make sense. Brooks offers his latest company, Robust.ai, a warehouse robotics system, as an example of this. Someone suggested to him recently that it would be cool and efficient to tell his warehouse robots where to go by building an LLM for his system. In his estimation, however, this is not a reasonable use case for generative AI and would actually slow things down. It’s instead much simpler to connect the robots to a stream of data coming from the warehouse management software. “When you have 10,000 orders that just came in that you have to ship in two hours, you have to optimize for that. Language is not gonna help; it’s just going to slow things down,” he said. “We have massive data processing and massive AI optimization techniques and planning. And that’s how we get the orders completed fast.” Another lesson Brooks has learned when it comes to robots and AI is that you can’t try to do too much. You should solve a solvable problem where robots can be integrated easily. “We need to automate in places where things have already been cleaned up. So the example of my company is we’re doing pretty well in warehouses, and warehouses are actually pretty constrained. The lighting doesn’t change with those big buildings. There’s not stuff lying around on the floor because the people pushing carts would run into that. There’s no floating plastic bags going around. And largely it’s not in the interest of the people who work there to be malicious to the robot,” he said. Brooks explains that it’s also about robots and humans working together, so his company designed these robots for practical purposes related to warehouse operations, as opposed to building a human-looking robot. In this case, it looks like a shopping cart with a handle. “So the form factor we use is not humanoids walking around — even though I have built and delivered more humanoids than anyone else. These look like shopping carts,” he said. “It’s got a handlebar, so if there’s a problem with the robot, a person can grab the handlebar and do what they wish with it,” he said. After all these years, Brooks has learned that it’s about making the technology accessible and purpose-built. “I always try to make technology easy for people to understand, and therefore we can deploy it at scale, and always look at the business case; the return on investment is also very important.” Even with that, Brooks says we have to accept that there are always going to be hard-to-solve outlier cases when it comes to AI, that could take decades to solve. “Without carefully boxing in how an AI system is deployed, there is always a long tail of special cases that take decades to discover and fix. Paradoxically all those fixes are AI complete themselves.” Brooks adds that there’s this mistaken belief, mostly thanks to Moore’s law, that there will always be exponential growth when it comes to technology — the idea that if ChatGPT 4 is this good, imagine what ChatGPT 5, 6 and 7 will be like. He sees this flaw in that logic, that tech doesn’t always grow exponentially, in spite of Moore’s law. He uses the iPod as an example. For a few iterations, it did in fact double in storage size from 10 all the way to 160GB. If it had continued on that trajectory, he figured out we would have an iPod with 160TB of storage by 2017, but of course we didn’t. The models being sold in 2017 actually came with 256GB or 160GB because, as he pointed out, nobody actually needed more than that. Brooks acknowledges that LLMs could help at some point with domestic robots, where they could perform specific tasks, especially with an aging population and not enough people to take care of them. But even that, he says, could come with its own set of unique challenges. “People say, ‘Oh, the large language models are gonna make robots be able to do things they couldn’t do.’ That’s not where the problem is. The problem with being able to do stuff is about control theory and all sorts of other hardcore math optimization,” he said. Brooks explains that this could eventually lead to robots with useful language interfaces for people in care situations. “It’s not useful in the warehouse to tell an individual robot to go out and get one thing for one order, but it may be useful for eldercare in homes for people to be able to say things to the robots,” he said.

    "commentBody": "Rodney Brooks on limitations of generative AI (techcrunch.com)93 points by doener 11 hours agohidepastfavorite83 comments ianbicking 2 minutes ago\"He says the trouble with generative AI is that, while it’s perfectly capable of performing a certain set of tasks, it can’t do everything a human can\" This kind of strawman \"limitations of LLMs\" is a bit silly. EVERYONE knows it can't do everything a human can, but the boundaries are very unclear. We definitely don't know what the limitations are. Many people looked at computers in the 70s and saw that they could only do math, suitable to be fancy mechanical accountants. But it turns out you can do a lot with math. If we never got a model better than the current batch then we still would have a tremendous amount of work to do to really understand its full capabilities. If you come with a defined problem in hand, a problem selected based on the (very reasonable!) premise that computers cannot understand or operate meaningfully on language or general knowledge, then LLMs might not help that much. Robot warehouse pickers don't have a lot of need for LLMs, but that's the kind of industrial use case where the environment is readily modified to make the task feasible, just like warehouses are designed for forklifts. reply TheOtherHobbes 5 minutes agoprevThe iPod didn't stop growing. It turned into an iPhone - a much more complex system which happened to include iPod features, almost as a trivial add-on. If you consider LLMs as the iPod of ML, what would the iPhone equivalent be? reply fxtentacle 10 hours agoprevTo me, this reads like a very reasonable take. He suggests to limit the scope of the AI problem, add manual overrides in case there are unexpected situations, and he (rightly, in my opinion) predicts that the business case for exponentially scaling LLM models isn't there. With that context, I like his iPod example. Apple probably could have made a 3TB iPod to stick to Moore's law for another few years, but after they reached 160GB of music storage there was no usecase where adding more would deliver more benefits than the added costs. reply aurareturn 10 hours agoparentI’m still waiting for SalesForce to integrate an LLM into Slack so I can ask it business logic and decisions long lost. Still waiting for Microsoft to integrate an LLM into outlook so I can get a summary of a 20 email long chain I just got CCed into. I don’t think the iPod comparison is a valid one. People only have so much time to listen to music. Past a certain point, no one has enough good music they like to put into a 3TB iPod. However, the more data you feed into an LLM, the smarter it should be in the response. Therefore, the scale of iPod storage and LLM context is on completely different curves. reply Propelloni 1 minute agorootparentMost data around is junk and the internet produces junk data faster then useful data and current GPT AIs basically regurgitate what someone already did somewhere on the internet. So I guess the more data we feed into GPTs the worse the results will get. My take to improve AI output is to heavily curate the data you feed your AI, much the like expert systems of old (which were lauded as \"AI\" also.) Maybe we can break the vicious circle of \"I trained my GPT on billions of Twitter posts and let it write Twitter posts to great sucess\", \"Hey, me too!\" reply MattPalmer1086 5 hours agorootparentprevHaha, I'd be happy if outlook just integrated a search that actually works. Most of outlook search results aren't even relevant, and it regularly misses things I know are there. Literally the most useless search I've ever had to use. reply lispm 9 hours agorootparentprev> However, the more data you feed into an LLM, the smarter it should be in the response. Is it that way? For example if it lacks a certain reasoning capability, then more data may not change that. So far LLMs lack useful ideas of truth, it will easily generate untrue statements. We see lots of hacks how to control that, with unconvincing results. reply aurareturn 9 hours agorootparentThat has not been my experience with GPT4 and GPt4o. Maybe you’re using worse models? The point is that the more context an LLM or human has, the better decision it can make in theory. I don’t think you can debate this. Hallucinations and LLM context scale are more engineering problems. reply akerr 9 hours agorootparentChatGPT says, “Generally, yes, both large language models (LLMs) and humans can make better decisions with more context. … However, both LLMs and humans can also be overwhelmed by too much context if it’s not relevant or well-organized, so there is a balance to be struck.” reply akerr 9 hours agorootparentprev“Yes, it is debatable.

There was definitely a more significant jump there in the middle where 7B models went from being a complete waste of time to actually useful.

If he think business needs does not exist he should explain how he arrived at that conclusion instead of a random iPod example. reply cerved 8 hours agorootparentIt's an analogy. He's making the point that even though something can scale at an exponential rate, it doesn't mean there is a business need for such scaling reply sigmoid10 9 hours agorootparentprevThis. The scaling of compute has vastly different applications than the scaling of memory. Shows once again that people who are experts in a related field aren't necessarily the best to comment on trendy topics. If e.g. an aeroplane expert critiques Spacex's starship, you should be equally vary, even though they might have some overlap. The only reason this is in the media at all is because negative sentiment to hype generates many clicks. That's why you see these topics every day instead of Rubik's cube players criticising the latest version of Mikado. reply roenxi 10 hours agoprev> He uses the iPod as an example. For a few iterations, it did in fact double in storage size from 10 all the way to 160GB. If it had continued on that trajectory, he figured out we would have an iPod with 160TB of storage by 2017, but of course we didn’t. I think Brooks' opinions will age poorly, but if anyone doesn't already know all the arguments for that they aren't interested in learning them now. This quote seems more interesting to me. Didn't the iPod switch from HDD to SSD at some point, and they focused on shrinking them rather than upping storage size? I think the quality of iPods have been growing exponentially, we've just seen some tech upgrades on other axises that Apple thinks are more important. AFAIK, looking at Wikipedia, they're discontinuing iPods in favour of iPhones where we can get a 1TB model and the disk size trend is still exponential. The original criticism of the iPod was that it had less disk space than its competitors and it turned out to be because consumers were paying for other things. Overall I don't think this is a fair argument against exponential growth. reply Sharlin 7 hours agoparentExponentials have a bad habit of turning into sigmoids due to fundamental physical and geometric, and also practical, constraints. There’s the thing called diminishing returns. Every proven technology reaches maturity; it happened to iPods, it happened to smartphones, it happened to digital cameras and so on. There’s still growth and improvement, but it’s greatly slowed down from the early days. But that’s not to say that there won’t be other sigmoids to come. If you haven’t noticed how growth in storage capacity of HDDs in general screeched to a relative halt around fifteen years ago? The doubling period used to be about 12-14 months; every three or four years the unit cost of capacity would decrease 90%. This continued through the 90s and early 2000s, and then it started slowing down. A lot. In 2005 I bought a 250 GB HDD; at the same price I’d now get something like a 15 EB drive if the time constant had stayed, well, constant. There is, of course, always a multitude of interdependent variables to optimize, and you can always say that growth of X slowed down because priorities changed to optimize Y instead. But why did the priorities change? Almost certainly at least partislly because further optimization of X was becoming expensive or impractical. > quality has been growing exponentially That’s an entirely meaningless and nonsensical statement unless you have some rigorous way to quantify quality. reply pyrale 10 hours agoparentprev> Overall I don't think this is a fair argument against exponential growth. Do we still need to make a fair claim against unrestricted exponential growth in 2024? Exponential growth claims have been made countless times in the past, and never delivered. Studies like the Limits to Growth report (1972) have shown the impossibility of unrestricted growth, and the underlying science can be used in other domains to show the same. There is no question that exponential growth doesn't exist, the only interesting question is how to locate the inflexion point. Apparently the only limitless resource is gullible people. reply croes 9 hours agoparentprevPeople thought we have FSD now because of the early success, but the last 20% are the hardest. The same is true for LLMs. What they can do is impressive but to fix what they can't will be hard or even impossible. reply lostmsu 3 hours agorootparentThere was never universally recognized early success in FSD. reply albert_e 9 hours agoparentprev> we would have an iPod with 160TB of storage by 2017, but of course we didn’t. 160 Tera Bytes to store what? I probably would never listen to more than a few GBs of high fidelity music in my life time. Why would anyone keep investing in exponential growth or even linear growth beyond a point of utility and economic sense. This can be extrapolated to miniaturization also ... why is a personal computer not smaller than my fingertip already? reply hanche 5 hours agorootparent> I probably would never listen to more than a few GBs of high fidelity music in my life time. FWIW, I currently have about 100 GB of music on my phone. And that is in a fairly high quality AAC format. Converted to lossless, it might be about five times that size? I don't even think of my music collection as all that extensive. But still, 160 TB would be a different ball game altogether. For sure, there is no mass market for music players with that sort of capacity. (Especially now that streaming is taking over.) reply roenxi 9 hours agorootparentprevArguing from a lack of personal imagination is not a strong position. It is the people with ideas who are responsible for finding uses for resources. They've succeeded every other time they were given an excess of storage space; I'm still not sure how I manage to use up all the TB of storage I've bought over the years. Maybe we store a local copy of a personal universe for you to test ideas out in, I dunno. There'll be something. > I probably would never listen to more than a few GBs of high fidelity music in my life time. Well from that I'd predict that uses would be found other than music. My \"music\" folder has made it up to 50GB because I've taken to storing a few movies in it. But games can quickly add up to TB of media if the space is available. reply albert_e 5 hours agorootparentStorage did become cheaper and more compact. Both flash drives and SD cards offer this functionality and showed significant improvements. Whatever innovative use cases people could come up with to store TBs of data in physical portable format is served by these. And along the way the world has shifted to storing data more cheaply and conveniently on the cloud instead. IPod being a special purpose device , with premium pricing (for average global consumer) and proprietary connectors and software would not have made a compelling economic case to over-spec it in hopes that some unforseen killer use case might emerge from the market. reply roenxi 5 hours agorootparent> IPod being a special purpose device , with premium pricing... Well, yes but if we're literally talking the iPod, it has been discontinued. Because it has been replaced by devices - with larger storage, I might note - that do more. I'm working from the assumption that as far as Brooks was talking iPhones basically are iPods. This is why the argument that the tech capped out seems suspect to me. The tech kept improving exponentially and we're still seeing storage space in the iPod niche doubling every few years. reply latexr 9 hours agoparentprev> I think Brooks' opinions will age poorly, but if anyone doesn't already know all the arguments for that they aren't interested in learning them now.

While music file sizes have been fairly consistent for a while, you can keep adding more apps and photos. The former become larger as new features are added (and as companies stop caring about optimisations) while the latter become larger with better cameras and keep growing in number as the person lives. reply ozgrakkurt 10 hours agoparentprevHow can it exponentially grow ever?

He's done his best work when he didn't try to overreach. The six-legged insect thing was great, but very dumb. Cog was supposed to reach human-level AI and was an embarrassing dud.

Without the ability to propose a hypothesis and then experimentally test it in the physical real world, no ML technique or app can add new information to the world. The only form of creativity possible using AI (as it exists today) is to recombine existing information in a new way -- as a musical composer or jazz artist creates a variation on an theme that already exists. But that can't be compared to devising something new that we would call truly creative and original, especially novel work that advances the frontier of our understanding of the world, like scientific discovery. reply ben_w 9 hours agoparentprevThat's not what ML is. You have some input, which may include labels or not. If it does have labels, ML is the automatic creation of a function that maps the examples to the labels, and the function may be arbitrarily complex. When the function is complex enough to model the world that created the examples, it's also capable of modelling any other input; this is why LLMs can translate between languages without needing examples of the specific to-from language pair in the training set. The data may also be synthetic based on the rules of the world; this is how AlphaZero beats the best Go and chess players without any examples from human play. reply michaelt 9 hours agoparentprevHypothetically? Training data gives the model an idea what \"blue\" means, and what \"cat\" means. It can now generate sensible output about blue cats, despite blue cats not being normal. reply richrichie 9 hours agoparentprevML is (smooth) surface fitting. That's mostly it. But that is not undermining it in any way. Approximation theory and statistical learning have long history, full of beautiful results. The kitchen sinks that we can throw at ML are incredibly powerful these days. So, we can quickly iterate through different neural net architecture configurations, check accuracy on a few standard datasets and report whatever configuration that does better on Archiv. Some might call it 'p-hacking'. reply IshKebab 9 hours agoparentprevIt's predicting a function. You train it on known inputs (and potentially corresponding known outputs). You get a novel output by feeding it a novel input. For example asking an LLM a question that nobody has even asked it before. The degree to which it does a good job on those questions is called \"generalisation\". reply none_to_remain 10 hours agoprev> Brooks explains that this could eventually lead to robots with useful language interfaces for people in care situations.

Sorry for not commenting on the article directly. reply visarga 20 minutes agoparent> a new way of doing things comes along, then you start figuring out how to do it and how to use it, and once you're there you rinse and repeat This happens a billion times a month in chatGPT rooms. User comes with a task, maybe gives some references and guidance. The model responds. User gives more guidance. And this iterates for a while. The LLM gets tons of interactive sessions, it can learn how to rank the useful answers higher. This creates a data flywheel where people generate experience and LLMs learn and iteratively improve. LLMs have the tendency to make people bring the world to them, they interact with the real world through us. reply lostmsu 3 hours agoparentprevCopilot can not read your mind: that is an impressive argument against AI! reply portaouflop 11 hours agoprev [–] Let’s call it machine learning, the AI term is just so far from what it actually is reply IanCal 1 hour agoparentNo. AI is what we've called things far simpler for a far longer time.

FAST, CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL: A ROBOT INVASION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM: https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/fast-cheap.pdf reply bubblyworld 10 hours agorootparent\"Out-of-Control Theory\" is a great name, love it =) thanks for the link, although I guess the idea never really took off. reply DonHopkins 9 hours agorootparentIt certainly did take off, it's called \"Subsumption Architecture\", and Rodney Brooks started iRobot, who created the Roomba, which is based on those ideas. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture Subsumption architecture is a reactive robotic architecture heavily associated with behavior-based robotics which was very popular in the 1980s and 90s. The term was introduced by Rodney Brooks and colleagues in 1986.[1][2][3] Subsumption has been widely influential in autonomous robotics and elsewhere in real-time AI. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot iRobot Corporation is an American technology company that designs and builds consumer robots. It was founded in 1990 by three members of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab, who designed robots for space exploration and military defense.[2] The company's products include a range of autonomous home vacuum cleaners (Roomba), floor moppers (Braava), and other autonomous cleaning devices.[3] reply bubblyworld 8 hours agorootparentOkay, interesting, but I meant nobody actually ended up sending thousands of little robots to other planets. No doubt the research led to some nice things. Edit: the direct sensory-action coupling idea makes sense from a control perspective (fast interaction loops can compensate for chaotic dynamics in the environment), but we know these days that brains don't work that way, for instance. I wonder how that perspective has changed in robotics since the 90s, do you know? reply DonHopkins 5 hours agorootparentAbout four years before Rodney Brooks proposed Subsumption Architecture, some Terrapin Logo hackers from the MIT-AI Lab wrote a proposal for the military to use totally out-of-control Logo Turtles in combat, in this article they published on October 1, 1982 in ACM SIGART Bulletin Issue 82, pp 23–25: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1056602.1056608 https://donhopkins.com/home/TurtlesAndDefense.pdf >TURTLES AND DEFENSE >Introduction >At Terrapin, we feel that our two main products, the Terrapin Turtle ®, and the Terrapin Logo Language for the Apple II, bring together the fields of robotics and AI to provide hours of entertainment for the whole family. We are sure that an enlightened application of our products can uniquely impact the electronic battlefield of the future. [...] >Guidance >The Terrapin Turtle ®, like many missile systems in use today, is wire-guided. It has the wire-guided missile's robustness with respect to ECM, and, unlike beam-riding missiles, or most active-homing systems, it has no radar signature to invite enemy missiles to home in on it or its launch platform. However, the Turtle does not suffer from that bugaboo of wire-guided missiles, i.e., the lack of a fire-and-forget capability. >Often ground troops are reluctant to use wire-guided antitank weapons because of the need for line-of-sight contact with the target until interception is accomplished. The Turtle requires no such human guidance; once the computer controlling it has been programmed, the Turtle performs its mission without the need of human intervention. Ground troops are left free to scramble for cover. [...] >Because the Terrapin Turtle ® is computer-controlled, military data processing technicians can write arbitrarily baroque programs that will cause it to do pretty much unpredictable things. Even if an enemy had access to the programs that guided a Turtle Task Team ® , it is quite likely that they would find them impossible to understand, especially if they were written in ADA. In addition, with judicious use of the Turtle's touch sensors, one could, theoretically, program a large group of turtles to simulate Brownian motion. The enemy would hardly attempt to predict the paths of some 10,000 turtles bumping into each other more or less randomly on their way to performing their mission. Furthermore, we believe that the spectacle would have a demoralizing effect on enemy ground troops. [...] >Munitions >The Terrapin Turtle ® does not currently incorporate any munitions, but even civilian versions have a downward-defense capability. The Turtle can be programmed to attempt to run over enemy forces on recognizing them, and by raising and lowering its pen at about 10 cycles per second, puncture them to death. >Turtles can easily be programmed to push objects in a preferred direction. Given this capability, one can easily envision a Turtle discreetly nudging a hand grenade into an enemy camp, and then accelerating quickly away. With the development of ever smaller fission devices, it does not seem unlikely that the Turtle could be used for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons. [...] reply oska 8 hours agorootparentprev [–] There will never be, and can never be, \"artificial intelligence\". (The creation of consciousness is impossible.) It's a fun/interesting device in science fiction, just like the concept of golems (animated beings) are in folk tales. But it's complete nonsense to talk about it as a possibility in the real world so yes, the label of 'machine learning' is a far, far better label to use for this powerful and interesting domain. reply bubblyworld 8 hours agorootparentI'll happily engage in specifics if you provide an argument for your position. Here's mine (which is ironically self-defeating but has a grain of truth): single-sentence theories about reality are probably wrong. reply oska 8 hours agorootparentI just went back and added a parenthetical statement after my first sentence before seeing this reply (on refresh). > The creation of consciousness is impossible. That's where I'd start my argument. Machines can 'learn', given iterative training and some form of memory but they can not think nor understand. That requires consciousness, and the idea that consciousness can be emergent (which it is my understanding that the 'AI' argument rests upon), has never been shown. It is an unproven fantasy. reply MattPalmer1086 3 hours agorootparentI don't see why consciousness is necessary for thinking. I would define thinking as the ability to evaluate propositions and evidence and arrive at some potentially useful plan or hypothesis. I see no reason why a machine could not do this, but without any awareness (\"consciousness\") of itself doing it. I also see no fundamental obstacle to true machine awareness either, but given your other responses, we can just disagree on that. reply bubblyworld 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd I guess I'd start my retort by saying that it can't be impossible, because here we are talking about it =P reply oska 8 hours agorootparentNo, you don't have any proof for the creation of consciousness, including human consciousness (which is what I understand you are referring to). In my view, and in the view of major religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, etc) plus various philosophers, consciousness is eternal and the only real thing in the universe. All else is illusion. You don't have to accept that view but you do have to prove that consciousness can be created. An 'existence proof' is not sufficient because existence does not necessarily imply creation. reply bubblyworld 8 hours agorootparentLook, I don't want to get into the weeds of this because personally I don't think it's relevant to the issue of intelligence, but here's a list of things I think are evident about consciousness: 1. People have different kinds of conscious experience (just talk to other humans to get the picture). 2. Consciousness varies, and can be present or not-present at any given moment (sleep, death, hallucinogenic drugs, anaesthesia). 3. Many things don't have the properties of consciousness that I attribute to my subjective experience (rocks, maybe lifeforms that don't have nerve cells, lots of unknowns here). Given this, it's obvious that consciousness can be created from non-consciousness, you need merely to have sex and wait 9 months. Add to that the fact that humans weren't a thing a million years ago, for instance, and you have to conclude that it's possible for an optimisation system to produce consciousness eventually (natural selection). reply oska 7 hours agorootparentYour responses indicate (at least to me) that you are, philosophically, a Materialist or a Physicalist. That's fine; I accept that's a philosophy of existence that one can hold (even though I personally find it sterile and nihilistic). However many, like me, do not subscribe to such a philosophy. We can avoid any argument between ppl who hold different philosophies but still want to discuss machine learning productively by using that term, one that we can all agree on. But if materialists insist on using 'artificial intelligence' then they are pushing their unproven theories and I would say fantasies on the rest of us and they then expose a divergent agenda, where one does not exist when we all just talk about what we all agree we already have, which is machine learning. reply bubblyworld 7 hours agorootparentIf you find it sterile and nihilistic that's on you, friend =) I think pragmatic thinking, not metaphysics, is what will ultimately lead to progress in AI. You haven't engaged with the actual content of my arguments at all - from that perspective, who's the one talking about fantasies really? Edit: in case I give the mistaken impression that I'm angry - I'm not, thank you for your time. I find it very useful to talk to people with radically different world views to me. reply quonn 6 hours agorootparentprevThe Buddha did not teach that only consciousness is real. He called such a view speculative, similar to a belief that only the material world is real. The buddhist teaching is, essentially, that the real is real and ever changing and that consciousness is merely a phenomenon of that which is reality. reply oska 6 hours agorootparentCheers, I should have been more precise in my wording there. I should have referred to some (Idealist) schools of thought in Buddhism & Hinduism, such as the Yogachara school in Buddhism. Particularly with Hinduism, its embrace of various philosophies is very broad and includes strains of Materialism, which appears to be the other person's viewpoint, so again, I should have been more careful with my wording. reply meiraleal 1 hour agorootparentprev [–] > There will never be, and can never be, \"artificial intelligence\".

Fedor Indutny, due to a CVE report filed against his project, started getting hounded by people on the internet bringing the vulnerability to his attention. Unfortunately, Indutny's case isn't isolated. In recent times, open-source developers have been met with an uptick in receiving debatable or, in some cases, outright bogus CVE reports filed for their projects without confirmation. This can lead to unwarranted panic among the users of these projects and alerts being generated by security scanners, all of which turn into a source of headache for developers. 'node-ip' GitHub repository archived Earlier this month, Fedor Indutny who is the author of the 'node-ip' project archived the project's GitHub repository effectively making it read-only, and limiting the ability of people to open new issues (discussions), pull requests, or submit comments to the project.node-ip GitHub repo archived and made 'read-only' (BleepingComputer) The 'node-ip' project exists on the npmjs.com registry as the 'ip' package which scores 17 million downloads weekly, making it one of the most popular IP address parsing utilities in use by JavaScript developers. On Tuesday, June 25th, Indutny took to social media to voice his reasoning behind archiving 'node-ip': \"There is something that have [sic] been bothering me for past few months, and resulted in me archiving node-ip repo on GitHub,\" posted the developer via his Mastodon account. It has to do with CVE-2023-42282, a vulnerability disclosed in the project earlier this year. \"Someone filed a dubious CVE about my npm package, and then I started getting messages from all people getting warnings from 'npm audit',\" states the developer in the same post. Node.js developers using other open projects, such as npm packages and dependencies in their application can run the \"npm audit\" command to check if any of these projects used by their application have had vulnerabilities reported against them. Bothered dev took to social media to voice his concerns (Mastodon) The CVE has to do with the utility not correctly identifying private IP addresses supplied to it in a non-standard format, such as hexadecimal. This would cause the 'node-ip' utility to treat a private IP address (in hex format) such as \" 0x7F.1...\" (which represents 127.1...) as public. Should an application rely solely on node-ip to check if a provided IP address is public, non-standard inputs can cause inconsistent results to be returned by the affected versions of the utility. 'Dubious' security impact Public sources suggest that CVE-2023-42282 had originally been scored as a 9.8 or \"critical.\" Although Indutny did indeed fix the issue in later versions of his project, he disputed that the bug constituted an actual vulnerability and that too of an elevated severity. \"I believe that the security impact of the bug is rather dubious,\" the developer earlier wrote, requesting GitHub to revoke the CVE. \"While I didn't really intend the module to be used for any security related checks, I'm very curious how an untrusted input could end up being passed into ip.isPrivate or ip.isPublic [functions] and then used for verifying where the network connection came from.\" Disputing a CVE is no straightforward task either, as a GitHub security team member explained. It requires a project maintainer to chase the CVE Numbering Authorities (CNA) that had originally issued the CVE. CNAs have conventionally comprised NIST's NVD and MITRE. Over the past few years, technology companies and security vendors joined the list and are also able to issue CVEs at will. These CVEs, along with the vulnerability description and the reported severity rating, are then syndicated and republished by other security databases, such as GitHub advisories. Following Indutny's post on social media, GitHub lowered the severity of the CVE in their database and suggested the developer turn on private vulnerability reporting to better manage incoming reports and cut noise. At the time of writing, the vulnerability's severity on NVD remains \"critical.\" A growing nuisance The CVE system, originally designed to help security researchers ethically report vulnerabilities in a project and catalog these after responsible disclosure, has lately attracted a segment of community members filing unverified reports. While many of the CVEs are filed in good faith by responsible researchers and represent credible security vulnerabilities, a recently growing pattern involves newbie security enthusiasts and bug bounty hunters ostensibly \"collecting\" CVEs to enrich their resume rather than reporting security bugs that constitute real-world, practical impact from exploitation. Consequently, developers and project maintainers have pushed back. In September 2023, Daniel Stenberg, creator of the well-known software project 'curl' rebuked the \"bogus curl issue CVE-2020-19909,\" a Denial of Service bug reported against the project. Originally scored as a 9.8 or critical in severity per NVD's history, the now-disputed CVE has had its rating dropped to a \"low\" 3.3 after discussions ensued questioning the tangible security impact of the flaw. \"This was not a unique instance and it was not the first time it happened. This has been going on for years,\" Stenberg wrote criticizing the CVE entry. \"I am not a fan of philosophical thought exercises around vulnerabilities.\"\"They are distractions from the real matters and I find them rather pointless. It is easy to test how this flaw plays out on numerous platforms using numerous compilers.\" \"It's not a security problem on any of them.\" According to Stenberg, the technical details of the \"silly bug\" meant it could result in unexpected behavior, not a security flaw that could be abused. Yet another npm project, micromatch which gets 64 million weekly downloads has had 'high' severity ReDoS vulnerabilities reported against it with its creators being chased by community members inquiring about the issues. \"Can you point out at least one library that implements micromatch or braces that is susceptible to the vulnerability so we can see how it's actually a vulnerability in the real world, and not just theoretical?\" asked Jon Schlinkert, reacting to CVE-2024-4067 filed for his project, micromatch. In the same thread, the developer, apparently after failing to receive a satisfactory proof of concept exploit from the vulnerability reporter responded with: \"I get these issues all the time for things that can't even be a vulnerability unless you do it to yourself. Like regex in low level libraries that will never be accessible to a browser, unless you're letting users submit regular expressions in a web form that are just used by your application.\" \"I asked for examples of how a real-world library would encounter these 'vulnerabilities' and you never responding with an example.\" I too, recently messaged micromatch developers after a third party informed us of a potential \"risk\" posed by the project, as it seemed like the responsible thing to do at the time. Unfortunately, as opposed to representing an exploitable vulnerability, it ended up being a nuisance report (much like CVE-2024-4067) that developers had already been chased about. Other than just being an annoyance for project maintainers, the act of getting CVEs issued for unverified vulnerability reports is akin to stirring up a Denial of Service (DoS) against a project, its creators, and its wider consumer base, and for good reasons. Developer security solutions (such as npm audit) which are designed to prevent vulnerable components from reaching your applications may trigger alerts if any known vulnerabilities are detected and depending on your settings, break your builds. \"Jackson had this problem a few months back, where someone reported a critical CVE against the project and broke builds all around the planet,\" a commentator had written in 2023, reacting to the bogus curl CVE. Rather than being a security problem with the project, as other developers stated, the issue represented the inherent nature of recursive Java data structures. Where is the balance? Recurring incidents like these raise the question, how does one strike a balance? Relentlessly reporting theoretical vulnerabilities can leave open-source developers, many of who are volunteers, exhausted from triaging noise. On the flip side, would it be ethical if security practitioners, including novices, sat on what they thought was a security flaw—so as not to inconvenience the project maintainers?A third problem arises for projects without an active maintainer. Abandoned software projects that have not been touched in years contain vulnerabilities that, even when disclosed, will never be fixed and there exists no means to contact their original maintainer. In such cases, intermediaries including CNAs and bug bounty platforms are left in limbo. On receiving a vulnerability report from a researcher, these organizations may not always be able to sufficiently vet every such report independently. Without hearing from the (now absent) project maintainers, they may be compelled to assign and publish CVEs after the \"responsible disclosure\" window has elapsed. No simple answer exists to these problems just yet. Until the security research, developer, and vendor communities come together to identify an effective solution, developers are bound to get frustrated with bogus reports burning them out, and the CVE system becoming flooded with exaggerated \"vulnerabilities\" that may look credible on paper but are effectively moot.Related Articles: Juniper releases out-of-cycle fix for max severity auth bypass flawCritical GitLab bug lets attackers run pipelines as any userExploit for critical Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow SQLi flaw releasedHackers target new MOVEit Transfer critical auth bypass bugCISA: Most critical open source projects not using memory safe code freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"bleepingcomputer_728x90_320x50_InContent_1\", slotId: \"bleepingcomputer_728x90_320x50_InContent_1\" });CVE Ethical Disclosure MITRE VulnerabilityAx SharmaAx Sharma is an Indian-origin British security researcher and journalist focused on malware analyses and cybercrime investigations.

Make people mistrust it and / or the dev 3. Fork / clone it 4. People flood to download the fork / clone 5. Wait a period of time and make the fork malicious Seems like malicious actors can use this to their advantage quite easily.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a comment Not a member yet?

    "commentBody": "Dev rejects CVE severity, makes his GitHub repo read-only (bleepingcomputer.com)89 points by rntn 3 hours agohidepastfavorite85 comments nostrademons 2 hours agoThere's an interesting point hiding in the article about security being an emergent property of the whole software system. Many libraries are flagged with CVEs because they can be used as part of the trust boundary of the whole software system, and they have corner cases that allow certain malicious inputs to give outputs that may be surprising and unexpected to the clients of the library. The library developers push back and say \"Can you point to one real-world vulnerability where the library is actually used in the way that the CVE says constitutes a vulnerability?\", effectively pushing the responsibility back onto the clients of the library. But that's exactly how real malware usually works. Individual components that are correct in isolation get combined in ways where the developer thinks that one component offers a guarantee that it doesn't really, and so some combination of inputs does something unexpected. An enterprising hacker exploits that to access the unexpected behavior. There isn't really a good solution here, but it seems like understanding this tradeoff would point research toward topics like proof-carrying code, fuzzing, trust boundaries, capabilities, simplifying your system, and other whole-system approaches to security rather than nitpicking individual libraries for potential security vulnerabilities. reply alx_the_new_guy 58 minutes agoparent>The library developers push back and say \"Can you point to one real-world vulnerability where the library is actually used in the way that the CVE says constitutes a vulnerability?\" From my understanding of the article, the developer suggested people provide not a \"real-world vulnerability\" but an example of one - a small project that exposes said vulnerability and steps one has to take to abuse it. And what he got irritated about was lack of such examples. More so since he had been effectively email-DDoSed and had to chase some entity to mark the vulnerability as resolved, which probably took orders of magnitude more time, energy and soul from him, than actually fixing the bug. But the _actual_ problem is the thanklessness (preferably material) of the work put into such open source projects, developer burnout and what not. Guy probably made like 1000$ total off of those millions of downloads per week. Understandably, he doesn't want his time being seemingly wasted discussing and fixing such seemingly unimportant issues. Making open source materially rewarding and a more or less legitimate occupation is the real issue. reply philipwhiuk 2 hours agoparentprev> But that's exactly how real malware usually works. Individual components that are correct in isolation get combined in ways where the developer thinks that one component offers a guarantee that it doesn't really, and so some combination of inputs does something unexpected. An enterprising hacker exploits that to access the unexpected behavior. That means there's a security vulnerability in the app and a bug in the library. Not a security vulnerability in the library. IMO it's a mistake to assign CVEs to libraries reply solatic 1 hour agorootparentI would mostly agree, with the exception of libraries that are responsible for parsing untrusted input and making it safe. You can't, on the one hand, tell developers, \"always validate your input, if not then we have a security vulnerability, and don't write your own validation libraries because they're super risky to get right\", then pretend that the security hole caused by a bug in the library should have been handled properly in some fashion by developers. And that is indeed the case here. The node-ip library had a security vulnerability in the function that informed developers if an IP was private or not. That's important when you accept user-defined webhooks and you want to ensure that an attacker isn't giving you something that resolves to a private IP within your own network. The whole process of \"validating untrusted user input\" ends up relying, at least in part, on libraries like this which tell you whether the components of the input are safe. reply leni536 2 hours agoparentprev> effectively pushing the responsibility back onto the clients of the library. That does not compute. The responsibility is pushed back onto the security researcher to prove that there is an actual vulnerability in practice. Libraries (ideally) have documentation and contracts on what they expect on their input. If clients don't abide to the contract then it's on them. If the library has a wide contract then it's on the library. However even if the library has a bug, the bug needs to be exercised by clients for it to be an actually impactful vulnerability. reply notatoad 2 hours agoparentprev>effectively pushing the responsibility back onto the clients of the library. well, yes. that's how this should work. if you want to use a library, it's up to you to decide whether or not it is a good fit for your project, including whether it has security issues that you need to worry about. a tool like NPM audit can help you make this decision, but there is no scenario where it makes a library developer responsible for fixing a security issue in your own project (unless you're paying them for that service). reply dgb23 2 hours agoparentprevEvery library makes assumptions about the usage context. Stating those assumptions up front should be sufficient. For example, Go has two differing template libraries: one for general text and one for HTML. They have very different assumptions about how you use them and what they protect against and those are stated in the documentation. reply Ekaros 1 hour agoparentprevIf we keep this idea in mind. Couldn't we argue that any piece of software that communicates over internet might allow any type of exploiting, including arbitrary code execution at Ring 0.

Funnily enough, almost all open source projects not only disclaim such liability in very large print at the top of their licenses, but they don't even complicate the relationship with some kind of purchase agreement and renumeration. They literally just say \"Here's a thing. Use it if you want, change it if you want, but you're responsible for making sure it meets your requirements.\" reply throwaway_62022 2 hours agoparentprevUgh - say I wrote a daemon that runs every 2 hours, it exposes no end points and has no metrics.

The problem is, from their viewpoint the security researcher is completely correct: a vulnerability is a vulnerability. Consuming applications absolutely have to do their own research for CVEs in dependencies, to determine if they are impacted or not, and to develop mitigations on their side as well if needed. reply philipwhiuk 2 hours agorootparent> The problem is, from their viewpoint the security researcher is completely correct: a vulnerability is a vulnerability.

There is no good solution here but not allowing CVEs to be assigned to libraries is by far the worst one. reply joshka 3 minutes agoprevIf I was getting spam from devs to fix a thing in a library like this, my response would be \"sure, here's my rate $/h\". This seems like a pretty fair put up or shut up response. The underlying issue here is that there are many libraries that a supported by solo devs like this. An idea I just had is that it would be reasonable to calculate a risk metric for every package in the various eco-systems that takes repo maintainer count (and other things) into consideration. Publishing this metric into the package metadata / package page on npmjs would probably gamify not having single points of failure in widely used libraries, and make it clear when this is happening at some point in your dependency chain (averting a future left-pad style debacle). reply kibwen 2 hours agoprevMy predisposition is that the people hounding open-source devs for unpaid urgent tech support are predominantly commercial users freeloading off the software, which, amusingly, means that a compelling argument in favor of licensing your software as GPL is to scare away these sorts of users. reply jmclnx 2 hours agoparentI would suggest GPL3, that would really scare away commercial users.

In other words, if you are the lone dev of a library that has been GPL for 20 years, and then you get hired, and you want to use that library at your job, you can just make a copy of it and say \"this copy is yours to do with as you please, have fun\". You don't even need to mess around with dual-licensing. Licenses affect only people who aren't the copyright holder. reply dgb23 1 hour agorootparentprevIt depends on why the library is open source. A lot of maintainers do it so they don't have to re-write everything when they change jobs. Those would generally agree with you.

Security is important and having cyber folks that have programming background is even more important. Mindless lemmings otherwise. reply prymitive 2 hours agoparentMost of this behaviour comes from the desire by many companies to by compliant with a lot of security regulations. Which in many cases means silly rule like “you must run and action a security scanning system”. Because a lot of these scanners are just dumb wrappers running any piece of software that pretends to be a security scanner, and because the more rules does one have the more “valuable” it is, you end up with a race to scan the most. And that sadly translates into rules and reports like https://hackerone.com/reports/191220 - OPTIONS method can be used to check what methods does a web server accepts, therefore an attacker might use it to learn which methods to use for the attack. Except they can just try it with no effort. It’s this sort of “if you can see a lock then attacker will use that knowledge to know where the lock is” logic that must be followed by “let’s remove all locks so they cannot be attacked” response. reply dogleash 1 hour agoparentprevYeah, they're risk analysts, not technologists. That's not inherently bad, you need those. In a previous life I worked in a domain with a lot of risk analysis, by the end I liked a lot of them and they were usually fairly easy to have as stakeholders. But security has a track record of failing to equip the rest of a business with process adequate for the inherent volatility in risk they're supposed to be managing. In the engine room it's still dashing from fire to fire, just with better fire alarms. The things you complain about are precisely the business problems that the security group should be solving. Cybersecurity is important enough that they can get away with overbearing demands without providing holistic solutions for the organization to reach them. reply kstrauser 1 hour agoparentprevThat's a very narrow view, to the point of being flat-out wrong. I was a CISO. Before that, I was a staff platform engineer who wrote the software other people would be evaluating. I never, not once, pushed an upstream dev to fix a thing. I provided plenty of PRs over the years. If they didn't get merged, we maintained our own locally patched version. My job was to find a way for us all to do as little as possible to meet our security goals. Those goals were lofty and sometimes that turned out to require quite a bit of work.

I don't think anyone could come up with a tangible exploit chain but the Node.js maintainers made the breaking change anyway because of the CVE. There was maybe one guy bringing attention to the CVE and 20 or so more people complaining about broken production applications. I wonder at what point people give up on CVE notices and just don't update for security patches when the majority of CVE reports are bogus anyway. I know the Node.js library we work with had about 10 security notices on npm audit. But none of them compromise the libraries security in any way. People still try to remedy them with npm audit fix but that just causes there dependencies to break completely. reply ang_cire 2 hours agoprevFrankly, the end of the article where it says that CNAs don't have the time to verify the vulns being reported for new CVE issuance, is the real problem.

The part that isn't being discussed how it is more profitable for certain commercial interests to have more vulnerabilities even if they are bogus. There is something wrong with security industry and we are all paying the price.

Just PR and Jira dance one has to do is exhausting. reply patrakov 1 hour agoparentprevThe recommendation of \"blocking builds/deploys that contain high CVEs\" is nonsense.

All of the popular open source licenses, GPL, MIT and BSD, quite plainly state that, to the extent permissible by law, there is no warranty about anything, whatsoever. There was a time when Linux users (in general) understood this. You want free? You pick any distribution you like. You want a warranty? You pick RedHat. But over time, it seems we've gotten to a point where \"I imported your package, so that means you're obliged not to break my precious CI\" has somehow become the norm.

When a CI pipeline flags a vuln in a dependency it typically goes to the dev couched as a \"defect\" they need to remedy as part of their unrelated PR.

Their language and methods are parroted by unscrupulous actors - like entities who buy/usurp control of a repository for malicious means. If we get here, the likely outcomes seem to be: 1) CVE reporting authorities recognize the problem and tighten up reporting procedures (to mostly good ends) or 2) The people who properly depend on CVEs become increasingly exhausted trying to validate their integrity; they devalue and depend on them less. This further accelerates CVE's lack of trustworthiness and gives bad actors wider room to operate. reply lowbloodsugar 2 hours agoprev [–] TL;DR The CVE system has no authentication mechanism (to determine the authenticity of reported “bugs” or verify their reported level) resulting in a DDOS of maintainers.

Polly Thompson 2024-06-27T09:56:19Z Share Facebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link Save Read in app The Patagonia logo is a status symbol for tech workers and mountaineers alike. Michael M. Santiago/ Getty Patagonia has told 90 customer-service staff to relocate to one of seven locations or leave. The affected staff have three days to inform the company of their decision. The company said it's trying to improve team culture and support business needs. Advertisement The outdoor-apparel brand Patagonia has given 90 US employees a choice: tell the company by Friday that you're willing to relocate or leave your job. The employees all work in customer services, known at Patagonia as the customer-experience, or CX, team, and have been allowed to work remotely to field calls and inquiries. These workers received a text and email Tuesday morning about an \"important\" meeting. \"At 10 a.m. PST we will be hosting an important Town Hall Meeting,\" the internal email, which was seen by Business Insider, read. Advertisement \"We understand that some are scheduled to be off today, but please know that we will pay you for the day [8 hours] if you can make the time to attend.\" Two company executives, Amy Velligan and Bruce Old, told staff in a 15-minute video meeting that the team would be moving to a new \"hub\" model. CX employees are now expected to live within 60 miles of one of seven \"hubs\" — Atlanta; Salt Lake City; Reno, Nevada; Dallas; Austin; Chicago; or Pittsburgh. Workers were offered $4,000 toward relocation costs and extra paid time off. Those willing to relocate were told to do so by September 30. Advertisement If CX staff are not willing to live near a hub city, they must leave the company. They were given 72 hours, until Friday, to confirm their decision. \"It was very factual. If you don't live in these seven metro areas, you either need to move there or give us your stuff and hit the brick,\" one affected CX worker told BI. \"If we don't respond by Friday, they will assume that we have chosen the severance package and we'll start that process.\" The town hall was followed by one-on-one meetings with human resources. Access to company laptops and phones was shut off later that day until employees either agreed to relocate or said they wanted the severance, one affected CX worker said. Patagonia verified the details of the announcement to BI, confirming that 90 of 255 CX staff in the US were affected by the company's announcement. Advertisement The brand has seven stores and outlets in California but the state was not chosen as a hub. George Frey/Getty Images \"I definitely feel like I've been laid off,\" one CX worker told BI, asking to remain anonymous as they had yet to finalize their severance package. \"I've never been late for work. I have gotten nothing but outstanding performance reviews.\" The severance package was generous, the worker said, but it was sad to see a company they had believed in \"fall to the Walmart level.\" Both employees BI spoke to said they were accepting the severance and did not know anyone who was considering relocation. Corley Kenna, a Patagonia spokesperson, told BI that several employees had already indicated they would relocate. Advertisement \"These changes are crucial for us to build a vibrant team culture,\" Kenna said, adding that CX workers often complained about feeling disconnected. Related stories The company hopes to bring staff together at the hubs at least once every six weeks for in-person training, company gatherings, or \"Activism Hours\". Hub locations Patagonia chose the hubs on the basis of \"where we have existing community and retail locations,\" Kenna said. California, a state that's core to the brand's identity and home to its corporate headquarters in Ventura and seven Patagonia stores, was not chosen. Advertisement Both employees who spoke to BI believed this was because Patagonia didn't want to handle the increased demands of employees in states with higher costs of living. \"We've been asking for raises for a long time, and they keep telling us that your wage is based on a Reno cost of living and where you choose to live is on you.\" \"Unfortunately, a California-based hub would not meet the criteria we set for a sustainable CX model,\" Kenna told BI, confirming that the cost of living and other business needs contributed to the decision. \"The reality is that our CX team has been running at 200% to 300% overstaffed for much of this year,\" she added. \"While we hoped to reach the needed staffing levels through attrition, those numbers were very low, and retention remained high.\" Advertisement 'Big corp in sheep's clothing' The company, founded by the rock climber Yvon Chouinard, was ranked by an Axios-Harris poll in 2023 as the most reputable brand in America. Chouinard founded Patagonia. Jean-Marc Giboux/Contributor/Getty Images Jokingly referred to as \"Patagucci,\" it's become the go-to uniform for style-conscious tech developers and mountaineers alike. Now a multibillion-dollar company, it's beloved for its focus on sustainability and efforts to develop a more ethical form of capitalism. \"Let my people go surfing\" was Chouinard's relaxed mindset toward working culture. Advertisement In 2022, the founder took the unprecedented step of transferring Patagonia to a trust and nonprofit that directs a portion of its profits toward combatting the climate crisis. \"Instead of 'going public,' you could say we're 'going purpose,'\" Chouinard wrote at the time. Since September 2022, Patagonia has donated more than $71 million in earnings to numerous charitable and political causes, The New York Times reported earlier this year. \"It feels like they're full of shit, that they would rather spend their money on the world instead of their people,\" one worker said in response to the restructuring. Advertisement \"Let my people go surfing\" was Chouinard's attitude about his company's culture. The Washington Post/Getty Images \"I think that the company has changed a lot since it sold to Mother Earth,\" the second CX employee said. \"Since Yvon stepped away, it's been a slow burn of shifting away from caring about employees.\" The rhetoric around attendance became tougher, and for the last year, employees were told the company was over budget, the employee added. \"Patagonia is not this small, niche outdoor company anymore, it's a big corp in sheep's clothing. I still think they made good products but I think they don't treat their people as well as they claim to.\" Are you a worker at Patagonia?

Example: „let’s reduce the waste we produce by reutilising more, which is going to cost us more in terms of logistics but if we can advertise it as green maybe it helps our sales” => impossible to conclusively verify, so what is going to drive the decision?

Most were laid off, but I got to work from home. The larger initiative was to get everyone into a strategic office location, with the goal of fostering these collaborative cultures. Eventually I was forced to relocate to an office. The big new office they built was in a city chosen for its low cost. No one wanted to move there, those who were there wanted to leave. I was originally supposed to go there, but then got routed somewhere else at the last minute. Fast forward a few years. I’m back to working from home, after ever promise around the relocation turned out to be a lie. That new office they were bragging about never gets brought up anymore. It was in a location people didn’t want to live, they didn’t get great people as a result. Any good people they did find eventually left the company for an opportunity in a better location. The office I left, that I felt forced to move, is about to be shutdown. The brain drain that happened as a result of all of this has been massive. There is no culture anymore, just a revolving door. It used to be common to have a room full of people who had been with the company for 10-20 years. They knew each other and there was a deep culture. Now, no one know anyone, and no one cares, because they won’t be around long anyway.

I don’t want to live in such metros. reply AmVess 17 hours agoparent\"CX employees are now expected to live within 60 miles of one of seven \"hubs\" — Atlanta; Salt Lake City; Reno, Nevada; Dallas; Austin; Chicago; or Pittsburgh.\" All of these places are aggressively poor choices. reply endtime 17 hours agorootparentI moved to Dallas from NY last year and am really enjoying it. reply archagon 15 hours agorootparentprevIn what sense are they poor choices? reply simfree 14 hours agorootparentEither your living somewhere that is very hot for a good chunk of the year and has a rapidly increasing cost of living, or your stuck in the rustbelt. Most of these cities aren't renown for their access to mountains or large state and national parks, making it much harder to enjoy the outdoors lifestyle that so many Patagonia customers participate in. reply leereeves 10 hours agorootparentReno is right next to Lake Tahoe, a very popular outdoor recreation area, and the Tahoe National Forest. It's also just a couple hours from Yosemite. Salt Lake City also has fantastic wilderness nearby, and one of the best winter sports scenes in the nation. Perhaps in the world - they hosted the Olympics in 2002 and probably will again in 2034. reply malfist 17 hours agorootparentprevThe article mentions they specifically didn't choose the corporate headquarters in California as a hub because it wasn't low cost of living reply JoshGG 17 hours agoprevThis is gross. What’s the corporate motivation to not just call it what it is - a layoff? reply klardotsh 17 hours agoparentBecause layoffs are, rightfully, in the spotlight as distasteful, cruel, and usually not based in financial reality right now. They get severe negative press, because they're severe negative actions (while companies rake in record profits - I'm mostly not talking about little seed-A-B-round startups going under here). And so companies are trying to find creative ways to avoid that negative press, IMO. reply banish-m4 17 hours agorootparentYep. It's a passive-aggressive way to blame the victim for not participating in gotcha capitalism. reply 627467 16 hours agoparentprevother than when there's an actual legal implication: why does it matter what it's called? reply malfist 17 hours agoparentprevBecause they're doing it for a \"vibrant team culture\" The type of culture that caused the company to shut off access to your laptop reply marcus0x62 17 hours agorootparentThey're a \"family\". And, truly, who among us hasn't turned off a family member's door code and escorted them to the end of the driveway? reply klipklop 14 hours agoprevHope nobody fell for it and took the relocation. More than likely they will just pip or lay you off soon after arriving. “We noticed your performance slipping. Please give us a status report in blocks of 15 minutes daily.” reply Gualdrapo 17 hours agoprevI just remembered there's a bit of a saying here when someone is told to go very far away (or to go f*k themself), \"lo mandaron a la Patagonia\" (\"he was told to go to the Patagonia\"). reply adw 17 hours agoparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Send_to_Coventry reply hypeatei 18 hours agoprev> The company said it's trying to improve team culture and support business needs.

How'd you like that juicy $500 severance package?\" reply instagib 8 hours agoprev@Dang Why was this post kicked from the main page?

Such hostile management tactics feel like a layoff strategy in disguise.

Oh and don't forget their history of use of carcinogenic materials and slave labor. reply olliej 17 hours agoprevThis sounds like constructive dismissal, which is illegal. Labelling laying people off as them “quitting” is also illegal. reply Suppafly 14 hours agoparentHow is it constructive dismissal, unless you didn't read any of the specifics of the article? reply schlipity 18 hours agoprev>Workers were offered $4,000 toward relocation costs and extra paid time off. Those willing to relocate were told to do so by September 30. It looks like just saying yes buys you an extra 3 months and paid time off to interview to find a new job. reply oatmeal_croc 17 hours agoparentYou usually need to return relocation costs if you quit within a year, and they'd lose out on the severance as well.. But yes, it does make sense for some people especially ones on a work based visa. reply willsmith72 18 hours agoparentprevDo that and you'll lose your severance reply exe34 17 hours agorootparentwhich is fine if you have another job lined up imho reply analognoise 17 hours agorootparentYeah but why bother if the severance is that good? Just take the money and run. reply exe34 5 hours agorootparentit's often easier to get a new job when you already have one. the severance would have to be worth a significant number of months of pay before it pays for the longer time looking for a job afterwards. reply hugocast 16 hours agoprevI moved cross-country in 2012 and got 12k to relocate.

My robot scours social media platforms 24/7 for people talking about their lost luggage and which airlines they flew, in 100+ different languages. By cross referencing that with actual lost luggage data it estimates very closely how much luggage is constantly being lost. All major airlines are tracked 24/7. It takes into account airline size differences by flights and fleet size.

As I collect more data over the next few weeks, I can add charts and growth % to see which airlines grow or decrease in lost luggage. If you have more ideas, tweet me! Why? Vueling lost my gf's suitcase last week and it's now on a trip to random spots around the world without coming back to us while getting gaslit by useless Vueling staff! I realized nobody collects data on how much luggage specific airlines are losing every day to avoid the worst ones. This helps me (and hopefully you too) to book with airlines that put effort in to not lose luggage or get it back fast to their customers! And rewards great airlines for not losing our luggage. Limitations? Airlines don't publish live lost luggage data (probably for a reason). Using social media as a data source has limitations but seems to be a good proxy indicator when combined with historical lost luggage data. Probabilities and lost bags are live estimations.

    "commentBody": "A live ranking of airlines by how much luggage they are losing (luggagelosers.com)81 points by lopkeny12ko 2 hours agohidepastfavorite37 comments crazygringo 48 minutes agoWow, it can be way more common to lose your bag than I would have thought -- on Aer Lingus, a 1 out of 57 chance! (While Delta is 1 in 497, and Air France is 1 in 1,256 -- more what I expected.) But the national aspect is seemingly even more interesting -- in India you have a 1 in 97 chance, while in the US it's 1 in 497, and in Japan it's 1 in 7,734. Now I'm incredibly curious to know what the real, actual culprits are. To what extent is is about the check-in airport or connecting airport that loses it, to what extent is it about airline policies around how luggage is handled, and to what extent is it national regulation that sets standards for airline performance, airport performance, or both? Because the amount of variation here is just astounding and far, far, beyond anything I would have guessed. I would have naively figured that lost luggage was at a relatively \"economically efficient\" level and would therefore be pretty similar across airlines and countries... when clearly that is not the case at all. reply bobthepanda 29 minutes agoparentafaik in Japan it's pretty common to use the takkyubin system while traveling where you forward your luggage, so I wonder if that has anything to do with it. https://en.japantravel.com/guide/takkyubin/31203 reply NetBeck 20 minutes agoparentprev> According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data analyzed by the SEIU, airlines directly employed 75% of their baggage handlers and skycaps as late as 2002.

Semi-related: I work for a homeless service agency and a few of our clients were arrested for a tiny luggage theft ring at LAX a couple of months ago.

I'd like to understand the methodology better here. What's the \"historical lost luggage data\" referenced here? I'm skeptical of how accurate scraping twitter posts is. Many (if not most) incidents don't get posted about, so I assume they must be doing some extrapolation. reply qazxcvbnmlp 11 minutes agoprevThis is cool, it’s also not the most accurate.

Edit: see page 39 Point to point carriers such as Allegiant and Spirit typically do much better than carriers that operate a connection like Delta and United.

Attribution to airlines doesn't make much sense to me. Country ranking is better but anecdotal experience tells me there are some cursed airports. reply cronin101 1 hour agoprevWorth remembering that airlines don’t handle your luggage themselves and instead contract it out to ground handling companies. It would be more interesting to map flight carriers/numbers to handlers (e.g. Menzies) and regions to give a more reasonable blame/availability overview. reply DrBenCarson 1 hour agoparentI know that’s true for non-hub airports but is it also true for hubs? Is Delta really contracting out luggage handling at Hartsfield-Jackson? reply pimlottc 30 minutes agorootparentI would think it's more likely that luggage handling is centralized at major hubs.

This month it was even more popular to lose 922 bags. reply barbegal 17 minutes agoparentFormula seems to be round(num_social_media_posts * 460.85) Where 460.85 comes from is unsure, but I guess a calibration factor based on some more reputable data set. reply jmspring 59 minutes agoprevThere is a regional issue that can come about. We hung out with friends a little over a week ago in Croatia and Italy. We came back via Rome -> Copenhage n -> SFO. No luggage issues on SAS. Friends flew Split -> London -> SFO on British Airways. Apparently the day they left a large percentage of luggage that transited the BA terminal in Heathrow had issues. One bag was lost (returned to the US) for about 5 days, the other is still location unknown. A big problem is that gate people and checkin people will suddenly claim \"the flight is full\" (some times it is) and try and force people to pack bags. When tasked with such, people don't always think about possible valuables in their bags and rebalance accordingly. In the case of our friends. Their \"carry on\" was not much bigger than a backpack. The flight was not full. The recovered bag, thankfully, had jewelry and other items the wife of the couple didn't think about when agreeing to check the bag. reply jpnguyen 51 minutes agoprevInteresting charts to see!

I wonder if useful for regulatory bodies as metric for overall operational scorecarding, or correlations with overall airline safety/incidents. reply throwaway63467 26 minutes agoprevBritish Airways lost my bag but found it again when I boarded my return flight, they paid all of the nice replacement clothes I bought during the trip. So I’m fine with them losing my luggage again! reply the_mitsuhiko 45 minutes agoprevUnsurprisingly point-to-point airlines lose less luggage. I'm guessing that those numbers are greatly influenced by which airports you connect through or how commonly an airline flies through problematic airports etc. US Airlines are probably also less often going to lose luggage since it's typically (from my experience at least) impossible to check through luggage into a domestic connection. reply standardUser 43 minutes agoprevWhat is with the combined 'GB' and 'IE' characters?

It says: > My robot scours social media platforms 24/7 for people talking about their lost luggage and which airlines they flew, in 100+ different languages. By cross referencing that with actual lost luggage data it estimates very closely how much luggage is constantly being lost. I think it needs more transparency on how this is working. There are going to be major cultural differences in terms of how often people complain on social media about lost luggage, and also just differences in frequencies of different terms (\"lost luggage\", \"lost bags\", \"lost bag\", \"lost my bag\", \"lost my luggage\") in different languages.

    "originBody": "An Analog Network of Resistors Promises \"Machine Learning Without a Processor,\" Researchers Say Prototyped on a series of breadboards, this analog machine learning network could one day deliver more energy-efficient AI. Gareth HalfacreeFollow 25 days ago • Machine Learning & AI 1 Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania have come up with an interesting approach to machine learning that could help to address the field's ever-growing power demands: taking the processor out of the picture and working directly on an analog network of resistors. \"Standard deep learning algorithms require differentiating large non-linear networks, a process that is slow and power-hungry,\" the researchers explain. \"Electronic learning metamaterials offer potentially fast, efficient, and fault-tolerant hardware for analog machine learning, but existing implementations are linear, severely limiting their capabilities. These systems differ significantly from artificial neural networks as well as the brain, so the feasibility and utility of incorporating non-linear elements have not been explored.\" A network of resistors, with no traditional processor in sight, has shown potential for non-linear machine learning tasks. (📷: Dillavou et al) Until now, that is. In the team's research, a non-linear learning metamaterial is introduced — an analog electronic network of resistive elements based on transistors. It's not a traditional digital processor, and can't do the tasks a traditional processor can do — but it is tailored specifically to machine learning workloads, and proved able to perform computations that can't be handled in a linear system without the involvement of a processor beyond an Arduino Due to make measurements and connect to MATLAB. \"Each resistor is simple and kind of meaningless on its own,\" physicist Sam Dillavou, first author on the work, explains in an interview with MIT Technology Review. \"But when you put them in a network, you can train them to do a variety of things.\" The team has already demonstrated the same core technology being used in an image classification network. and in its latest work extends the concept to non-linear regression and exclusive OR (XOR) operations. Better still, it shows the potential to outperform the traditional approach of throwing the problems at digital processors: \"We find our non-linear learning metamaterial reduces modes of training error in order (mean, slope, curvature),\" the team claims, \"similar to spectral bias in artificial neural networks.\" The network itself has no external memory or traditional processor, but is supervised and measured by an Arduino Due. (📷: Dillavou et al) \"The circuitry is robust to damage,\" the researchers continue, \"retrainable in seconds, and performs learned tasks in microseconds while dissipating only picojoules of energy across each transistor. This suggests enormous potential for fast, low-power computing in edge systems like sensors, robotic controllers, and medical devices, as well as manufacturability at scale for performing and studying emergent learning.\" There is, of course, a catch: in its current form, existing as a prototype spread across a series of solderless breadboards, the metamaterial system draws around ten times the power of a state-of-the-art digital machine learning accelerator — but as it scales, Dillavou says, the technology should deliver on a promise of increased efficiency and the ability to remove external memory components from the bill of materials. The team's work has been published as a preprint on Cornell's arXiv server.

I’m not an EE) What they have is a transistor network, and they constrain all the transistors to the ohmic regime, so now the resistivity of an individual transistor can be some nonlinear function of its inputs, which is really cool, like detuning transistors to do analog computation instead of digital. Here’s the preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00537 reply fsckboy 27 minutes agoparent>the framing as a resistor network since I think that should be linear transistors are essentially non-linear, but they amplify and can be made to amplify linearly through the use of feedback resistors: if you divide the output voltage across a resistor pair which fixes the output as ratio to the input voltage, that geometric relationship will hold across broad range of input/outputs. for most applications you want linear amplification. (transistors work as a function of current, but passing the current through resistors yields a voltage measurement) a transistor can be thought of as resistive if you treat its voltage:current relationship as a measurement of resistance. reply arbuge 3 hours agoparentprevOnce the training is complete, one thing I didn't see mentioned in the paper was how they maintain the charge on the gate capacitors, which is analogous to the weights in a traditional neural network if I'm understanding this correctly. Any practical implementation will need to have some practical way to refresh that on a continuous basis so that the weights don't drift. Was this perhaps mentioned somewhere and I missed it? reply pfdietz 4 hours agoparentprev> linear (to first order? I love it when things are linear to first order. >.> reply rsfern 4 hours agorootparentDoesn’t everyone? But seriously, my actual question is whether an ideal resistor network can compute nonlinear functions since the individual resistors are linear in their input, ignoring possible nonlinear effects like temperature dependence of the conductivity of the resistors reply mistercow 3 hours agorootparentThere is a separate interesting question of whether you could exploit the nonlinearity of a network of non-ideal resistors in practice. Given that tom7 was able to use floating point inaccuracy as a source of nonlinearity for ML, I’m guessing the answer is probably “yes, but now your system is incredibly sensitive to stuff like ambient temperature”. reply duped 3 hours agorootparentprevBy definition it can't. An ideal resistor is a linear relation between the voltage across it and the current through it. If you are allowed switches in the network and the input is a fixed voltage then things get interesting. reply JKCalhoun 4 hours agorootparentprevJust spitballing: but I'm thinking about how slide rules are linear but can do calculations that, I believe?, are not limited to being linear. Due I imagine to logarithmic rulings and that logarithms can be added/subtracted in a linear fashion. reply utensil4778 2 hours agorootparentThat's more or less what we have now. Slide rules and computers are linear systems which can compute nonlinear functions. The problem is that computing anything takes time and must be a linear set of instructions executed in series (multiplied by many parallel cores). Using an analog approach could be vastly more efficient as operations are inherently parallel. You can fire off every neuron in a layer simultaneously and produce a result within nanoseconds, for basically any number of neurons. You could probably do the entire network as a single atomic operation, but that's a bit beyond my knowledge of neural networks reply RobotToaster 3 hours agoparentprevInteresting, I wonder if this can be used to create a programmable BEAM nervous network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_robotics reply utensil4778 4 hours agoparentprevYeah, a purely resistive network will be linear in all respects (discounting thermal and related drift).

XOR can usually be done with 1 or 2 neurons. And MNIST digit classification with ~25,000. Bringing all those numbers together we get 1 neuron = 32 nodes = 1sqm, would give a size of about a 900m square if breadboarded out for ordinary MNIST digits.

In a EE undergrad (2007, so it has been a bit) we spent plenty of time understanding resistors, capacitors, and inductors. We looked at example circuits and uses, we learned the math and theory... We developed intuition around them. Memristors were the missing fourth, and \"imagine what you could do with that!\" My imagination did not extend very far. Everything was being built with those other three and the non-linear components. It'll take a while to overcome that momentum. I feel like IPv6 has a similar barrier.
