Tagged: javascript. 3 Comments In my day job, I work on a JavaScript framework (LWC). And although I’ve been working on it for almost three years, I still feel like a dilettante. When I read about what’s going on in the larger framework world, I often feel overwhelmed by all the things I don’t know. One of the best ways to learn how something works, though, is to build it yourself. And plus, we gotta keep those “days since last JavaScript framework” memes going. So let’s write our own modern JavaScript framework! What is a “modern JavaScript framework”? React is a great framework, and I’m not here to dunk on it. But for the purposes of this post, “modern JavaScript framework” means “a framework from the post-React era” – i.e. Lit, Solid, Svelte, Vue, etc. React has dominated the frontend landscape for so long that every newer framework has grown up in its shadow. These frameworks were all heavily inspired by React, but they’ve evolved away from it in surprisingly similar ways. And although React itself has continued innovating, I find that the post-React frameworks are more similar to each other than to React nowadays. To keep things simple, I’m also going to avoid talking about server-first frameworks like Astro, Marko, and Qwik. These frameworks are excellent in their own way, but they come from a slightly different intellectual tradition compared to the client-focused frameworks. So for this post, let’s only talk about client-side rendering. What sets modern frameworks apart? From my perspective, the post-React frameworks have all converged on the same foundational ideas: Using reactivity (e.g. signals) for DOM updates. Using cloned templates for DOM rendering. Using modern web APIs likeand Proxy, which make all of the above easier. Now to be clear, these frameworks differ a lot at the micro level, and in how they handle things like web components, compilation, and user-facing APIs. Not all frameworks even use Proxys. But broadly speaking, most framework authors seem to agree on the above ideas, or they’re moving in that direction. So for our own framework, let’s try to do the bare minimum to implement these ideas, starting with reactivity. Reactivity It’s often said that “React is not reactive”. What this means is that React has a more pull-based rather than a push-based model. To grossly oversimplify things: in the worst case, React assumes that your entire virtual DOM tree needs to be rebuilt from scratch, and the only way to prevent these updates is to implement React.memo (or in the old days, shouldComponentUpdate). Using a virtual DOM mitigates some of the cost of the “blow everything away and start from scratch” strategy, but it doesn’t fully solve it. And asking developers to write the correct memo code is a losing battle. (See React Forget for an ongoing attempt to solve this.) Instead, modern frameworks use a push-based reactive model. In this model, individual parts of the component tree subscribe to state updates and only update the DOM when the relevant state changes. This prioritizes a “performant by default” design in exchange for some upfront bookkeeping cost (especially in terms of memory) to keep track of which parts of the state are tied to which parts of the UI. Note that this technique is not necessarily incompatible with the virtual DOM approach: tools like Preact Signals and Million show that you can have a hybrid system. This is useful if your goal is to keep your existing virtual DOM framework (e.g. React) but to selectively apply the push-based model for more performance-sensitive scenarios. For this post, I’m not going to rehash the details of signals themselves, or subtler topics like fine-grained reactivity, but I am going to assume that we’ll use a reactive system. Note: there are lots of nuances when talking about what qualifies as “reactive.” My goal here is to contrast React with the post-React frameworks, especially Solid, Svelte v5 in “runes” mode, and Vue Vapor. Cloning DOM trees For a long time, the collective wisdom in JavaScript frameworks was that the fastest way to render the DOM is to create and mount each DOM node individually. In other words, you use APIs like createElement, setAttribute, and textContent to build the DOM piece-by-piece: const div = document.createElement('div') div.setAttribute('class', 'blue') div.textContent = 'Blue!' One alternative is to just shove a big ol’ HTML string into innerHTML and let the browser parse it for you: const container = document.createElement('div') container.innerHTML = ` Blue! ` This naïve approach has a big downside: if there is any dynamic content in your HTML (for instance, red instead of blue), then you would need to parse HTML strings over and over again. Plus, you are blowing away the DOM with every update, which would reset state such as the value of s. Note: using innerHTML also has security implications. But for the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the HTML content is trusted. At some point, though, folks figured out that parsing the HTML once and then calling cloneNode(true) on the whole thing is pretty danged fast: const template = document.createElement('template') template.innerHTML = ` Blue! ` template.content.cloneNode(true) // this is fast! Here I’m using atag, which has the advantage of creating “inert” DOM. In other words, things likeordon’t automatically start downloading anything. How fast is this compared to manual DOM APIs? To demonstrate, here’s a small benchmark. Tachometer reports that the cloning technique is about 50% faster in Chrome, 15% faster in Firefox, and 10% faster in Safari. (This will vary based on DOM size and number of iterations, but you get the gist.) What’s interesting is thatis a new-ish browser API, not available in IE11, and originally designed for web components. Somewhat ironically, this technique is now used in a variety of JavaScript frameworks, regardless of whether they use web components or not. Note: for reference, here is the use of cloneNode on s in Solid, Vue Vapor, and Svelte v5. There is one major challenge with this technique, which is how to efficiently update dynamic content without blowing away DOM state. We’ll cover this later when we build our toy framework. Modern JavaScript APIs We’ve already encountered one new API that helps a lot, which is . Another one that’s steadily gaining traction is Proxy, which can make building a reactivity system much simpler. When we build our toy example, we’ll also use tagged template literals to create an API like this: const dom = html` Hello ${ name }! ` Not all frameworks use this tool, but notable ones include Lit, HyperHTML, and ArrowJS. Tagged template literals can make it much simpler to build ergonomic HTML templating APIs without needing a compiler. Step 1: building reactivity Reactivity is the foundation upon which we'll build the rest of the framework. Reactivity will define how state is managed, and how the DOM updates when state changes. Let's start with some \"dream code\" to illustrate what we want: const state = {} state.a = 1 state.b = 2 createEffect(() => { state.sum = state.a + state.b }) Basically, we want a “magic object” called state, with two props: a and b. And whenever those props change, we want to set sum to be the sum of the two. Assuming we don’t know the props in advance (or have a compiler to determine them), a plain object will not suffice for this. So let’s use a Proxy, which can react whenever a new value is set: const state = new Proxy({}, { get(obj, prop) { onGet(prop) return obj[prop] }, set(obj, prop, value) { obj[prop] = value onSet(prop, value) return true } }) Right now, our Proxy doesn’t do anything interesting, except give us some onGet and onSet hooks. So let’s make it flush updates after a microtask: let queued = false function onSet(prop, value) { if (!queued) { queued = true queueMicrotask(() => { queued = false flush() }) } } Note: if you’re not familiar with queueMicrotask, it’s a newer DOM API that’s basically the same as Promise.resolve().then(...), but with less typing. Why flush updates? Mostly because we don’t want to run too many computations. If we update whenever both a and b change, then we’ll uselessly compute the sum twice. By coalescing the flush into a single microtask, we can be much more efficient. Next, let’s make flush update the sum: function flush() { state.sum = state.a + state.b } This is great, but it’s not yet our “dream code.” We’ll need to implement createEffect so that the sum is computed only when a and b change (and not when something else changes!). To do this, let’s use an object to keep track of which effects need to be run for which props: const propsToEffects = {} Next comes the crucial part! We need to make sure that our effects can subscribe to the right props. To do so, we’ll run the effect, note any get calls it makes, and create a mapping between the prop and the effect. To break it down, remember our “dream code” is: createEffect(() => { state.sum = state.a + state.b }) When this function runs, it calls two getters: state.a and state.b. These getters should trigger the reactive system to notice that the function relies on the two props. To make this happen, we’ll start with a simple global to keep track of what the “current” effect is: let currentEffect Then, the createEffect function will set this global before calling the function: function createEffect(effect) { currentEffect = effect effect() currentEffect = undefined } The important thing here is that the effect is immediately invoked, with the global currentEffect being set in advance. This is how we can track whatever getters it might be calling. Now, we can implement the onGet in our Proxy, which will set up the mapping between the global currentEffect and the property: function onGet(prop) { const effects = propsToEffects[prop] ?? (propsToEffects[prop] = []) effects.push(currentEffect) } After this runs once, propsToEffects should look like this: { \"a\": [theEffect], \"b\": [theEffect] } …where theEffect is the “sum” function we want to run. Next, our onSet should add any effects that need to be run to a dirtyEffects array: const dirtyEffects = [] function onSet(prop, value) { if (propsToEffects[prop]) { dirtyEffects.push(...propsToEffects[prop]) // ... } } At this point, we have all the pieces in place for flush to call all the dirtyEffects: function flush() { while (dirtyEffects.length) { dirtyEffects.shift()() } } Putting it all together, we now have a fully functional reactivity system! You can play around with it yourself and try setting state.a and state.b in the DevTools console – the state.sum will update whenever either one changes. Now, there are plenty of advanced cases that we’re not covering here: Using try/catch in case an effect throws an error Avoiding running the same effect twice Preventing infinite cycles Subscribing effects to new props on subsequent runs (e.g. if certain getters are only called in an if block) However, this is more than enough for our toy example. Let’s move on to DOM rendering. Step 2: DOM rendering We now have a functional reactivity system, but it’s essentially “headless.” It can track changes and compute effects, but that’s about it. At some point, though, our JavaScript framework needs to actually render some DOM to the screen. (That’s kind of the whole point.) For this section, let’s forget about reactivity for a moment and imagine we’re just trying to build a function that can 1) build a DOM tree, and 2) update it efficiently. Once again, let’s start off with some dream code: function render(state) { return html` ${state.text} ` } As I mentioned, I’m using tagged template literals, ala Lit, because I found them to be a nice way to write HTML templates without needing a compiler. (We’ll see in a moment why we might actually want a compiler instead.) We’re re-using our state object from before, this time with a color and text property. Maybe the state is something like: state.color = 'blue' state.text = 'Blue!' When we pass this state into render, it should return the DOM tree with the state applied: Blue! Before we go any further, though, we need a quick primer on tagged template literals. Our html tag is just a function that receives two arguments: the tokens (array of static HTML strings) and expressions (the evaluated dynamic expressions): function html(tokens, ...expressions) { } In this case, the tokens are (whitespace removed): [ \"\", \"\" ] And the expressions are: [ \"blue\", \"Blue!\" ] The tokens array will always be exactly 1 longer than the expressions array, so we can trivially zip them up together: const allTokens = tokens .map((token, i) => (expressions[i - 1] ?? '') + token) This will give us an array of strings: [ \"\", \"Blue!\", \"\" ] We can join these strings together to make our HTML: const htmlString = allTokens.join('') And then we can use innerHTML to parse it into a : function parseTemplate(htmlString) { const template = document.createElement('template') template.innerHTML = htmlString return template } This template contains our inert DOM (technically a DocumentFragment), which we can clone at will: const cloned = template.content.cloneNode(true) Of course, parsing the full HTML whenever the html function is called would not be great for performance. Luckily, tagged template literals have a built-in feature that will help out a lot here. For every unique usage of a tagged template literal, the tokens array is always the same whenever the function is called – in fact, it’s the exact same object! For example, consider this case: function sayHello(name) { return html`Hello ${name}` } Whenever sayHello is called, the tokens array will always be identical: [ \"Hello \", \"\" ] The only time tokens will be different is for completely different locations of the tagged template: html`` html`` // Different from above We can use this to our advantage by using a WeakMap to keep a mapping of the tokens array to the resulting template: const tokensToTemplate = new WeakMap() function html(tokens, ...expressions) { let template = tokensToTemplate.get(tokens) if (!template) { // ... template = parseTemplate(htmlString) tokensToTemplate.set(tokens, template) } return template } This is kind of a mind-blowing concept, but the uniqueness of the tokens array essentially means that we can ensure that each call to html`...` only parses the HTML once. Next, we just need a way to update the cloned DOM node with the expressions array (which is likely to be different every time, unlike tokens). To keep things simple, let’s just replace the expressions array with a placeholder for each index: const stubs = expressions.map((_, i) => `__stub-${i}__`) If we zip this up like before, it will create this HTML:__stub-1__We can write a simple string replacement function to replace the stubs: function replaceStubs (string) { return string.replaceAll(/__stub-(\\d+)__/g, (_, i) => ( expressions[i] )) } And now whenever the html function is called, we can clone the template and update the placeholders: const element = cloned.firstElementChild for (const { name, value } of element.attributes) { element.setAttribute(name, replaceStubs(value)) } element.textContent = replaceStubs(element.textContent) Note: we are using firstElementChild to grab the first top-level element in the template. For our toy framework, we’re assuming there’s only one. Now, this is still not terribly efficient – notably, we are updating textContent and attributes that don’t necessarily need to be updated. But for our toy framework, this is good enough. We can test it out by rendering with different state: document.body.appendChild(render({ color: 'blue', text: 'Blue!' })) document.body.appendChild(render({ color: 'red', text: 'Red!' })) This works! Step 3: combining reactivity and DOM rendering Since we already have a createEffect from the rendering system above, we can now combine the two to update the DOM based on the state: const container = document.getElementById('container') createEffect(() => { const dom = render(state) if (container.firstElementChild) { container.firstElementChild.replaceWith(dom) } else { container.appendChild(dom) } }) This actually works! We can combine this with the “sum” example from the reactivity section by merely creating another effect to set the text: createEffect(() => { state.text = `Sum is: ${state.sum}` }) This renders “Sum is 3”: You can play around with this toy example. If you set state.a = 5, then the text will automatically update to say “Sum is 7.” Next steps There are lots of improvements we could make to this system, especially the DOM rendering bit. Most notably, we are missing a way to update content for elements inside a deep DOM tree, e.g.:${text}For this, we would need a way to uniquely identify every element inside of the template. There are lots of ways to do this: Lit, when parsing HTML, uses a system of regexes and character matching to determine whether a placeholder is within an attribute or text content, plus the index of the target element (in depth-first TreeWalker order). Frameworks like Svelte and Solid have the luxury of parsing the entire HTML template during compilation, which provides the same information. They also generate code that calls firstChild and nextSibling to traverse the DOM to find the element to update. Note: traversing with firstChild and nextSibling is similar to the TreeWalker approach, but more efficient than element.children. This is because browsers use linked lists under the hood to represent the DOM. Whether we decided to do Lit-style client-side parsing or Svelte/Solid-style compile-time parsing, what we want is some kind of mapping like this: [ { elementIndex: 0, //above attributeName: 'class', stubIndex: 0 // index in expressions array }, { elementIndex: 1 //above textContent: true, stubIndex: 1 // index in expressions array } ] These bindings would tell us exactly which elements need to be updated, which attribute (or textContent) needs to be set, and where to find the expression to replace the stub. The next step would be to avoid cloning the template every time, and to just directly update the DOM based on the expressions. In other words, we not only want to parse once – we want to only clone and set up the bindings once. This would reduce each subsequent update to the bare minimum of setAttribute and textContent calls. Note: you may wonder what the point of template-cloning is, if we end up needing to call setAttribute and textContent anyway. The answer is that most HTML templates are largely static content with a few dynamic “holes.” By using template-cloning, we clone the vast majority of the DOM, while only doing extra work for the “holes.” This is the key insight that makes this system work so well. Another interesting pattern to implement would be iterations (or repeaters), which come with their own set of challenges, like reconciling lists between updates and handling “keys” for efficient replacement. I’m tired, though, and this blog post has gone on long enough. So I leave the rest as an exercise to the reader! Conclusion So there you have it. In the span of one (lengthy) blog post, we’ve implemented our very own JavaScript framework. Feel free to use this as the foundation for your brand-new JavaScript framework, to release to the world and enrage the Hacker News crowd. Personally I found this project very educational, which is partly why I did it in the first place. I was also looking to replace the current framework for my emoji picker component with a smaller, more custom-built solution. In the process, I managed to write a tiny framework that passes all the existing tests and is ~6kB smaller than the current implementation, which I’m pretty proud of. In the future, I think it would be neat if browser APIs were full-featured enough to make it even easier to build a custom framework. For example, the DOM Part API proposal would take out a lot of the drudgery of the DOM parsing-and-replacement system we built above, while also opening the door to potential browser performance optimizations. I could also imagine (with some wild gesticulation) that an extension to Proxy could make it easier to build a full reactivity system without worrying about details like flushing, batching, or cycle detection. If all those things were in place, then you could imagine effectively having a “Lit in the browser,” or at least a way to quickly build your own “Lit in the browser.” In the meantime, I hope that this small exercise helped to illustrate some of the things framework authors think about, and some of the machinery under the hood of your favorite JavaScript framework.

Not the entire virtual DOM; old versions of Angular did this, but it was wasteful.useMemo doesn&#x27;t prevent that, but React.memo can (useMemo has a different role; it lets you choose when to recompute or recreate a normal JavaScript object. But on its own it won&#x27;t stop rerendering of child components!) [0]This invalidates some of their assumptions. The reason why React isn&#x27;t \"push-only\" isn&#x27;t because it does that, it&#x27;s because it sometimes buffers updates instead of always pushing them immediately. In fact, other frameworks like ~~Svelte also aren&#x27;t \"push-only\" and hence not strictly reactive~~! [edit: this is no longer true after Svelte v5, see discussion below] (Funnily enough, OP uses an article as a source that explains this correctly [1], but it seems they took the wrong lesson from it).The reason why signals are so cool is because the framework knows for any given state change which exact attributes in the DOM need to be re-rendered, even more specifically than \"the element and all its children\". But this neither implies reactivity nor the other way around. The two concepts are orthogonal.Anyways, kudos to the author for diving into this so deeply![0] useMemo is useful in combination with React.memo sometimes, as the latter compares objects shallowly&#x2F;by reference instead of their contents, so useMemo can be used to only recreate shallow references if its contents changed. You could probably also reimplement React.memo with useMemo, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t.

We’ll see. reply 698969 8 hours agorootparentprevYou can only do so many compiler-y things in a dynamically typed language like Javascript. And even less of it within the context of a single file, unless you implement a bundler (web jargon equivalent of linker). Otherwise by the time the run-of-the-mill bundler is done connecting parts of your component tree into a single file, so much of the high-level information of the component is lost that you can&#x27;t really do much analysis on it.At least that were the reasons I saw when I was thinking about the same. If anyone has ideas around it, please get in touch. reply sureglymop 3 hours agoparentprevI love svelte too but I&#x27;ve found it hard to integrate it in different places where I may run js (e.g. obsidian plugins, browser plugins). It was hard to configure the necessary tooling but maybe it&#x27;s not sveltes fault. I think svelte would really benefit from better documentation on how to do this (and I don&#x27;t mean sveltekit documentation). It was also at least non-trivial to use with typescript and even more non-trivial to have some third-party dependencies&#x2F;components that don&#x27;t use typescript. Again, maybe not sveltes fault and hard in every framework but those were my show-stopping issues the last time I tried to build something real in svelte. reply xrd 16 minutes agorootparentInteresting. I think you should ask some questions inside the Svelte discord channel. My opinion is that Svelte is the easiest to integrate because it doesn&#x27;t require the runtime that react does, for example. I&#x27;ve got Svelte running inside lots of non standard places, like browser extensions (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;please-at-me&#x2F;). It can take a few minutes to figure out how to get it built correctly for the context but it has never blocked me.I don&#x27;t disagree about your typescript point. Svelte community seems to have aligned around typescript being a challenge and I do like their assertion that jsdoc+eslint is a better approach. reply jph 4 hours agoparentprevToot your horn because your project is really great.

React also shifts to SSR-SPA mixed situation jus like svelte, both are impacted by Vercel, which is really sad), instead of just focusing on its sveltekit SSR-first, I have zero interest in it. Yes I know I can customize sveltekit to do SPA, but it&#x27;s very ugly and I don&#x27;t need all your SSR mental load to an already complex frontend world.Both Svelte and React are shifting to SSR-first, which is what Vercel can make money with, I read somewhere Vercel had many React core members now, after it bought out Svelte. reply xrd 9 hours agorootparentSvekyll was originally built on sveltekit and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get SSR and figure out the right adapter for nodejs and static hosting.

Make Screen and Component able to load an htm file, then hook its tags on the DOM and do whatever you want. Update a counter? Write that in your component. Some static networking class in the background either long-polls or gets pushed new data, dispatches update events that any component can listen to. Each component can make its own calls and update its own data instantly when a user interacts with it.No abstraction, no nonstandard HTML tags, no , no Proxy, no master class trying to figure out what part of the DOM should or shouldn&#x27;t be redrawn based on inbound data. Every component should be autonomous, every screen should be able to destroy or resurrect its own components. If you need a central data cache, put that on the ping and let every component deal with it on the event firing.[edit] I&#x27;ve built and maintained two frameworks, one for websites and one for single page apps, rewritten and improved over 20 years, originally in PHP, now in Nodejs. The main guiding principle for me has always been decoupling design from code. reply WA 1 hour agoparentSounds like you implemented MVC. Model (=Component) handles its own state. Screen (=View) subscribes to state changes in the model.

And because there is no property like `hasResolved` on JS promises, `use` adds one itself. (At least this was how an early draft proposed it, a lot of changes have been done since, and my knowledge might be out of date.)[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react.dev&#x2F;reference&#x2F;react&#x2F;Suspense reply theteapot 50 minutes agorootparentIs a thing in Vue3 also -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuejs.org&#x2F;guide&#x2F;built-ins&#x2F;suspense.html reply valenterry 7 hours agorootparentprevThank you, this is exactly what I meant!

But I guess that is mostly Javascripts fault after all. reply eyelidlessness 6 hours agorootparentprevThe way Suspense works is actually even a bit more interesting&#x2F;horrifying: it doesn’t throw an error, it throws a Promise. Which again you don’t need to know to use it, and so it’s a valid implementation detail, but it’s a really odd one. reply SebastianKra 2 hours agorootparentTo be fair, in js, throwing is the only way a function (aka Hook) can abort the execution of its calling function (aka Component).The decision to avoid a custom compiler is responsible for almost all oddities and downsides of React. reply marcelr 8 hours agoparentprevIf you mean effects as data, I can&#x27;t think of anything off top other than elm which is a language + framework.I&#x27;ve made my own though: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marcellerusu&#x2F;capable-js.Its not for use but it was an interesting experience that enables a lot of new patterns by using generators.I don&#x27;t claim that it is better than other frameworks though, there&#x27;s a lot of times where this pattern is significantly more cumbersome than just using react. reply valenterry 7 hours agorootparentVery cool!

While it never made it out of alpha, it had gotten some traction, and looking back, I am still proud of the architecture and design (not so much of the code, hehe).One day, a developer from this random company in Connecticut (I am German and lived in Germany at the time) reached out to me in my project&#x27;s IRC channel, and asked if I wanted to interview. I did, and I got the job.I moved to the UK, then to the US with my wife, and stayed with the company for 8 years. I got promoted from senior engineer to Sr. Principal Engineer and had an amazing time there. I now have a green card and live in CT with my 2 amazing children (with German and American citizenship).I often think back about how much that project and that person who reached out to me changed my life.

GAFAMs were still seen as cool enough to envy a well paid job at them. A lot of SV startups weren’t openly privacy hostile (or maybe the issue wasn’t took seriously enough).But I felt that this \"dream\" was only upon developers at that time and it stoped sometimes after. In fact, in 2015, while on a trip to SF, I ate with a former French coworker who decided to live the dream and he was already saying to me that he wanted to come back in Europe because he couldn’t stand the ambiant culture anymore.It wasn’t the job, he loved it, performed well, was well paid. It wasn’t even the people, he made some friends there, felt like people were genuinely nice.But it was more the delusion about the SV-Life and the mismatch in cultural values and in the global society lifestyle in which he felt you were nothing to others &#x2F; to the society without money.Now I do feel like that this sentiment about the US is now more mainstream in Europe even amongst those who never came in USA.ps : I urge you to not read any criticism in my comment, I’m describing a general sentiment from the other side of an ocean, probably with a big bias.

FWIW I had two German bosses who emigrated to the US(one to California, one to Atlanta), so the US is clearly an attractive place for them and they say they loved it there just like GP.The majority of Germans talking about how much they hate the US, have never lived there but they hate it nevertheless because it&#x27;s a populat thing to hate in Germany, and also they don&#x27;t work in tech, or need to rely on the welfare state, or are already from well off families where the lower local salaries make no difference. The ones working in tech who don&#x27;t rely on the welfare state, are quite open to the idea of moving there for the right money.Sure, if GP was one of those Germans from a mid-upper class background with a nice inherited Bavarian house (unaffordable at any German working wage) then immigrating to the US makes no sense as he already would have enough prosperity at home, but if you have no wealth and want to build it, then working in the US tech sector is much better than working in Germany.So no, a blanket generalization cannot be made of \"Germans wanting to move to the US\", as that highly depends on their social&#x2F;wealth class and career.Edit: seems I upset the apple cart with my comment.

I currently make around 85k USD&#x2F;y(base) and even if I could double that easily just by moving there, my living standard would go down dramatically as my current salary already puts me in top 5% in my country. I absolutely love how big US is, amazing national parks, the access to nature and general diversity of people, foods and cultures, but lack of public healthcare and free access to guns would be an absolute no no for me unless I was paid obscene amounts of money for those &#x27;inconveniences&#x27;. reply FirmwareBurner 39 minutes agorootparent>I&#x27;m from Poland and I would also not move to US [...] I currently make around 85k USD&#x2F;y(base)Well that&#x27;s why, because you already make very good money here. But the vast majority of Poles, or even other Europeans in even more expensive countries, don&#x27;t make anywhere near that money, while having much more expensive housing than Poland.With that kind of money you&#x27;re living the good life here already so there&#x27;s no reason to move to the US even for 2x-5x the money as you can already afford everything you could ever need in Poland on your current salary. You&#x27;re pretty much in a bubble and are the exception, not the rule.Like I said before, people with good material situation in Europe have almost no reason to move to the US. But what about those on less fortunate salaries with no wealth to their name, who would get a shot in the US for a >10x pay bump?A childhood friend&#x27;s dad moved to work in construction in the US(also from eastern Europe), and with the money from working 15 years there he&#x27;s set for life in Europe, already retired early and in a McMansion back home. There&#x27;s no way he could have achieved that financial independence by staying in his eastern European country. Not everyone in Europe has the potential to earn 85k&#x2F;year here, while in the US it&#x27;s much much easier.For many jobs, the EU-US discrepancy in pay is insane, and not just in SW dev. reply atraac 24 minutes agorootparent> Well that&#x27;s why, because you already make very good money here.

Most devs in Poland make good or really good money.> But what about those on less fortunate salaries with no wealth to their name, who would get a shot in the US for a 10x pay bump?I can&#x27;t imagine a person who makes minimal and moves to US in hopes of making more. Most people in EU who make minimal salaries live from paycheck to paycheck, they don&#x27;t save enough to risk moving across the world. I honestly think that this person either ends up homeless or makes minimal salary in US too and probably ends up worse, due to lack of public healthcare&#x2F;social support. If you want to make good money, you can do that in most countries(obviously with exception of 3rd world countries, countries with an ongoing crisis etc.). Moving to US won&#x27;t suddenly make it happen.If you already work in IT then the salary bump these days might be significant, but I would argue that salary to CoL ratio will stay roughly the same. Unless you&#x27;re exceptional at what you do and have an extremely good offer, you&#x27;re probably not going to improve your life significantly by moving. Why would moving to US give you &#x27;a shot at 10x pay bump&#x27; that you didn&#x27;t have in your own country? reply FirmwareBurner 13 minutes agorootparent>Sure but we&#x27;re talking in a technical forum where most of people work in software.

The vast majority of Poles not working in tech don&#x27;t earn that well at all (average salary in Poland is 20,265 EUR&#x2F;year) so pretty sure they might be more inclined to move to the US is given the chance at a 5x or so pay bump.>I can&#x27;t imagine a person who makes minimal and moves to US in hopes of making more. The alternative to SW dev careers in Europe is not minimal wage person living paycheck to paycheck. There are other jobs that pay mediocre or sub-mediocre in most EU countries but pay stellar in the US. For example my office mate&#x27;s brother moved to the US(North Carolina) to work in banking just like he did in Europe but according to him he \"gets paid bank to move money from one account to another and has less stres than at his job in Europe\".Same for other average jobs as well, that while not living paycheck to paycheck in Europe, don&#x27;t allow you to build any wealth either, but in the US can get paid significantly more even adjusted to CoL(North Carolina is not Poland cheap but it&#x27;s not SV expensive either). reply alpaca128 1 hour agorootparentprev> a blanket generalization cannot be made of \"Germans wanting to move to the US\"Same goes for your blanket generalization implying Germans are either rich, rely on welfare or like working in the US.I myself would never consider moving there just for a higher salary. reply FirmwareBurner 54 minutes agorootparent>Same goes for your blanket generalization implying Germans are either rich, rely on welfare or like working in the US.I never said Germans are relying on welfare, I said the Germans WHO rely on welfare would not consider moving to the US for obvious reasons.

Once I got laid off, I focused on it to the point that it became quite useful, and at some point, someone from Israel reached out with questions.I answered with a lot of delay, and when I explained that was due to me being out of a job and not able to afford a permanent internet connection, he offered to hire me and also set me up with a permanent connection with a contract paid by him.If you’re reading this, thank you Aric, I’m forever grateful for that chance!Curiously, last year I switched jobs and during the interview process it turned out the hiring manager had been a user of my project back in 2003 or so, which definitely helped with the interview process.The project’s name was mysql-ha, later renamed to highbase due to a Copyright infringement notice from Sun (who were good about it and gave me a free 1 year subscription to Enterprise MySQL when I renamed the project).

I even wired it up to my local bank’s very rudimentary API.It was beautifully designed (thanks to some help from a designer friend) and I was really proud of the architecture and Objective-C code.A large retailer reached out to me on LI and asked about a job. As part of the interview process they asked me to submit a code sample and I submitted basil. The senior dev in the interview commented that he didn’t have any negative comments about the code but instead spent the interview telling me the things he liked about it.

It was first person and dynamic lights (it was a thing back then). I was showing the editor side, which had 4 windows... front, side, top, and 3d. It was fortunate because they had a C++ project, and nobody really wanted to touch it. So I gained bonus points to getting for being open to it.The other demos I was showing was me mucking around with Javascript. One silly game was a helicopter trying to hit balloons. It had music and sfx.Surprisingly, of what I presented, he was really interested in the html+js demos, as they are doing a lot of web applications and want to push one of their existing products with more functionality.. animation, drag+drop, images, automation, etc.Its funny. I felt like I had nothing to really show that would land me a job. On this ocassion, I managed to show things that just happens to link with real projects (in one way or another) they are doing. They pretty much offered me a 2 day trial (on a thurs and fri) to see how I would get on. The good news I passed without issue. They gave me a web project, heavy in javascript -- and to 1) avoid full post back (refresh) and 2) to support drag+drop.I knew a little PHP at the time (more into C\\C++) but they were using VB.NET - so managed to learn a lot in those 2 days, and meet their expectations.I was officially a Junior Developer on Monday... and they decided to remove \"junior\" from my job title a few months later. reply stpn 11 hours agoprevA long time ago sonos didn&#x27;t support apple airplay.I did some protocol reversing and wrote a small program that pretended to be an airplay speaker to pipe audio to a sonos speaker (archive: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stephen&#x2F;airsonos)I ended up getting recruiting messages from both the airplay team at apple and some folks from sonos.

I am assuming that you are fairly green behind the ears? The thing about Big Tech companies is that they hire lots of developers. That’s in large part makes them Big Tech. “Having Apple on your CV” is not as prestigious as you’re making out. It doesn’t mean you have The Knowledge that makes you a ‘10x developer’ or whatever anywhere you work. In fact, it could mean that your mind has been poisoned by a Big Tech working style, and you’ve developed a bunch of habits that aren’t nearly as applicable to most other organisations.I say this as someone that’s never worked for any tech company anybody has heard of, nor any hip SV startup.It takes a particular sort of person to thrive in Big Tech. That isn’t just code for ‘really really really good’. It sounds like you still believe that it is. Plenty of ‘really really really good’ people wouldn’t do well at Apple, and plenty wouldn’t want to work there. I wouldn’t necessarily call myself ‘really really really good’, but I know that I don’t want to work at Apple. Not because I think I’m not good enough, not because k don’t think that I could keep up, and not because I don’t like their output as a company.Putting companies in a pedestal the way that you are is ultimately damaging for the industry. It fosters the increasingly cringey “get a job at FAANG!!!” culture. I’m sick of my YouTube recommendations being poisoned with “here’s how you pass a system design interview at Google” BS.

Sendmail was a mail processor that could not only arrange to send and receive mail, but it could translate addressing between the different networks (ARPA, Bitnet, CSNET, UUCP, etc.) The problem was, reading a sendmail config file was something like reading assembly code except you weren&#x27;t allowed to by vowels.

Recognizing an opportunity, I began self-studying FreeBSD and Linux, the operating systems used by the university for their internet services like DNS, email, and proxy servers. Before completing my degree, I applied for the sysadmin position at the uni. In the interviews, I was able to explain and answer even the hardest of questions. I was hired. I eventually went to \"ls\" elsewhere as well but this role, which I held for eight years, provided me with a foundational knowledge that I believe influences my career even to date! reply akoboldfrying 9 hours agoparent> eventually went to \"ls\" elsewherePoetic reply alexsmirnov 3 hours agoprevBack in early 2000x, I worked mostly as salesperson and CTO of the small company. Bored with marketing and sales, I decided to find engineering job. To get up to the software development train, I started learning Java and created a small project as the playground. It was time of Web 2.0 &#x2F; AJAX hype, so I took Java Server Faces as the base and added dynamic functionality to it. I did name project \"Ajax4jsf\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ajax4jsf. When it become less or more functional, I created couple demo applications, wrote several blogs about it, and mention it whenever I did found any resource related to Java and Web 2.0.The goal was to find a job in Russia, but no one pay attention. Instead, the project got some traction in US, and company from here made me offer. So I continued the same side project as the full time job. They did all work to provide visa ( and Green Card later ), and sell project to Jboss where it became \"richfaces\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;richfaces.jboss.org&#x2F; .Decent success story, but keep in mind several points that made it happen: - Project targeted a current hype wave.- It was implemented with wide used technologies.- A lot of time spent to promote it.For the moment, there are two possible candidates to repeat : Large language models, and cryptocurrencies. But former is already eclipsed the later, so probably it&#x27;s the only candidate. There&#x27;s a little set of technologies used by LLMs, so this choice is oblivious ( keep in mind, the project supposed to demonstrate you skills in areas required by potential employer, so nothing exotic ). When gold rush happened in Klondike, the total cost of the found gold was several times smaller than money spent on food, tools, whiskey, and whores. So it&#x27;s better to create some useful tools project ( like LangChain ). And promote, promote, promote. Wherever it&#x27;s possible. reply JakeAl 5 hours agoprevI created an online fan forum for The X-Files back in 1993 on the Delphi vax-based network as the web was starting to emerge. I created ASCII art of logos and stuff since it was a text-based menu-driven system. Newscorp bought the company and their marketing managers started asking me to create ASCII art for them. It turned out my fan forum was the biggest on the service with 25,000 members (that was a lot back then.) This got the attention of executives who wanted to use this new digital medium to market their properties not just for FOX Broadcasting but TV Guide, Harper Collins, FOX Film, FX Cable Network, etc. They decided to create a web-based online service to do it and hired me away from my job as a lab researcher working on gene therapy and moved me to Los Angeles to create and run the official X-Files web site. They liked me because I knew the tech and what fans wanted. I basically invented what was then the TV&#x2F;film marketing web site. All I really did was assess what marketing resources were available and figure out a way to put them online. I was literally the first person to put TV show trailers online Not film trailers, just TV. No one thought anyone cared enough about T shows to download a 1.4MB 320x240 TV spot over 14400bps. Crazy times. I spent $1000 on the video capture card to digitize tv spots on VHS tapes they sent me. This was when the Pentium 90 had just come out. They never followed through creating the web-based online service for Newscorp, but since I had created a web site and online community with millions of users I ended up managing all of the web sites for the television network (and coded most of them) and even worked on sites like FOX Sports when it first came out and became the goto guy on the FOX lot when it came to online content and understanding what the fans wanted out of web sites. I moved on to create and work on ecommerce sites during the dot com boom, later worked on the original Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2 and created the mod tools (the classic&#x2F;good ones), worked for Sony Pictures Imageworks Interactive ultimately Sony PlayStation where I managed the production on all of the PS1 Classics available for digital download as well as some less notable stuff. That was my last full time job.

That gave me a chance to start doing conference talks.When I finally announced I was looking for a new position in January 2022, after 14 years at my previous job, I got flooded with companies expressing interest.The one that actually caught my attention was Replay.io. The culture fit was perfect (smart people building an amazingly useful tool and solving unique techhnical problems), they knew me from my Redux work, the codebase used React + Redux, and it fit my history of working on dev tools that involved time travel in some way.So, lots of overlap, and I&#x27;m having a blast there still :) reply scarface_74 6 hours agoprevWhen I was at AWS working in the ProServe department, I got onto a popular open source project that eventually became a more official “AWS Solution”. While much of the work came out of customizations I did for customers that got reintegrated into the project, I did spend some time working on features that just scratched an itch.Once I found out how easy it was to put something through the open source process and have it posted to AWS Samples:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samplesI sanitized all of my customer facing solutions that didn’t have proprietary business logic and submitted them - 8 projects in all.When the interviewer asked me what project was I most proud of, I discussed my contributions to the “AWS Solution” that I knew the company probably used or had at least heard of and my own related work that was open source that I knew was inline with the strategy they were pursuing.I’ve been at the company 3 months and I’ve already implemented and modified 5 of my 8 personal open source projects. Two of the other three are based on now deprecated methods and once I dig into AWS Reinvent announcements, there may be better options out there than the AWS Solution.All that being said, the last time a side project landed me a job and the last time I did anything “open source” before 2021 was 1995 when I was in college. I submitted a HyperCard based Eliza clone to the info-Mac archive and AOL (this was 1995) and a professor from another college wanted me to integrate it in a HyperCard based Gopher server (kids ask your parents).I don’t do side projects. Anything I can’t afford from my main job I don’t need or I need to get a job paying more. For me, the same applies to learning new to me technology.

At that time, Ruby on Rails was the new hotness, and I was trying to learn that on the side.When MacOS released their \"dashboard widgets\" framework back around 2005ish, I wrote a widget for RubyDocs and released it, and it got quite popular.At the same time, a US company I heard about via the Rails mailing list was investing pretty heavily in Rails and, as a long shot, I applied there and mentioned I made that widget. It turns out they were all using it, and they basically gave me a job on the spot working remotely from Australia.The experience I got in that job led me to get an job at Microsoft in 2007, and they moved me and my family to Seattle, where I still live to this day, though I left MS over five years ago now. reply andrethegiant 7 hours agoparentDashboard widgets!

Then, I had some Asp.Net pages which would let you do interesting stuff with it: Find inactive accounts, Track someone&#x27;s alliance history, a few other things. I had half a dozen tools for different things, mostly I focused on building stuff which nobody had thought of yet, and made the tools only available to people in my alliance.All this was on the roadmap to start building a bot to play the game for me.

It got a little traction with some people using it and I won some nice prices for best project in the competition the hosting company put out after upgrading their API to REST. After the competition I was also able to get an account with no billing for testing purposes, which made developing and integration testing a whole lot easier. Before that I could only test on resources I paid for myself or ask them nicely to refund if I made a mistake as they don&#x27;t do per minute&#x2F;hourly billing like other providers.The project was eventually discovered by my (now former) employer who needed the same provider but did some searching before writing his own and discovered my project on Github. It landed me a job interview and eventually a job.

Does it do anything? I don&#x27;t know, certainly not immediately, and the problem persists.I tried the method spelled out here for my latest batch of \"Your USPS package has arrived\" texts, but the phone numbers (example: +63 936 631 6676) just give an \"invalid number\" response. Not unexpected.Every official channel seems to be failing us on this one. Spam calls still exist, spam texts still exist, and even fake government websites still exist. I don&#x27;t understand why a .com site like https :&#x2F;&#x2F;usps.com-helpnk.com&#x2F; is still up. reply furyg3 1 hour agoparentLike others, I&#x27;m confused about how there&#x27;s so much variation between countries on this one.In the US, the calls and texts are a plague. If you&#x27;ve had a phone number for a few years you&#x27;re probably getting multiple texts and calls a day, even if you are on the Do Not Call registry, from advertisers of every type and scammers alike. Lots of people have apps for blocking spam and they still get through.In the Netherlands I&#x27;m also on a do not call registry, and I get nearly zero spam calls or texts. There is the occasional scammer SMS, and I get a spam call maybe once every 2-3 months, usually for nonprofit fundraising.In developing countries you&#x27;re spammed by both the telco and third party advertisers within minutes of activating a prepaid SIM card. The telco is almost certainly delivering the advertisements.My guess is that the penalties and enforcement behind violating do-not-call registry in the Netherlands (EU?) are just much stronger than in the US. It still does not explain the lack of low-quality spam &#x2F; scam messages from people who are unlikely to be dissuaded by regulation.The only thing I can think of is that there is better authentication for accessing the Dutch telephone network (and better incentives for the telcos) which allow the providers to prevent or shut down spam numbers quickly. reply jimmydddd 9 hours agoparentprevI disagree with the posted page that the telecoms are interested in stopping spam. If they really cared, they would have addressed it by now. I suspect they are somehow making money from the spam callers. reply drdaeman 9 hours agorootparent> telecoms are interested in stopping spam. If they really cared, they would have addressed it by nowI&#x27;m not so sure about this. No one (except for, obviously, spammers) benefits from email spam, every mailhost and network admin is most certainly interested in stopping it (to some extent), and yet my mailbox can prove that spam is still very much alive.Solving spam problems in a highly distributed large federation of networks is not simple.However, I think there are less telecoms than LIRs and mail systems out there, and they typically have better control over who their clients are (less hacking, though I could be wrong), and there&#x27;s not enough pressure on them (spammy mailhost&#x27;s gonna get banned by every RDNSBL real quick, telcos - I don&#x27;t know, but I guess not so much?), so I can certainly agree that telecoms have issues with their incentives. I could be wrong about this, though - I don&#x27;t really know much about the telephone industry. reply calamari4065 6 hours agorootparentThe analogy doesn&#x27;t hold because anyone can send an email to anyone else on any service at any time.You can&#x27;t exactly just climb up a telephone pole and tap off a few phone numbers for yourself. You have to explicitly enter into a contract with a service provider to use their infrastructure.Spammers and scammers are wasting infrastructure resources that the telcos could be allocating to users. The telco can just cut your access off if you abuse it.If I spin up an email server, no one entity can stop me sending email to anyone else. Gmail or Outlook or other services can block me individually, but there is no centralized network and no central authority that can refuse my connection. [0]I suspect that telcos don&#x27;t want to do anything about abuse because it&#x27;s a very large fraction of their total traffic. The artificially higher utilization of the network gives them more justification for their prices or gives them some sort of good boy points for having x number of users. I don&#x27;t really know how any of that works, just a wild guess.[0] There are centralized blacklists and other ways to communicate that a sender should be widely blocked, but that&#x27;s not the same as a telco refusing to physically connect you reply kmoser 3 hours agorootparent> there is no centralized network and no central authority that can refuse my connectionYour ISP&#x2F;host can refuse service (assuming somebody convinces them to take that step).

The distributed system can&#x27;t solve the spam problem, because it&#x27;s not a technical problem.2. The population can immediately solve the spam problem by responding in the affirmative to every single request they get.What makes spam profitable is the quality of the responses - right now only the marks respond, so every response is valuable to the spammer as it is a lead that will almost certainly result in money.If the spammer sends out 3m SMS&#x2F;robocall messages, and gets 5 responses, those responses are worth actual money!OTOH, if the spammer sent out 3m SMS&#x2F;robocall messages, and got 3m responses (of which only 5 are worth money), then the spam would quickly stop.IOW, by self-selecting into one of two groups (will give you money&#x2F;won&#x27;t give you money) we are making spam profitable.This is the only way to stop spam of any kind - poison the database. reply pogue 39 minutes agorootparentWhen you say &#x27;poison the database&#x27; in the case if sms&#x2F;robocalls what exactly would that involve? reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentprevWhen you consider that most of this stuff originates from places outside of jurisdictions of any place that would ever consider doing something about it, you realize that legislation is worth much less than the paper it&#x27;s never printed on. reply viraptor 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s that time I get to repeat: The US is a big enough destination that threatening to drop incoming calls would work.

When you buy a new SIM card at the airport, the spamming starts within an hour or so. I count 18 sent yesterday alone, once every hour or so during the day.I believe it is actually the carrier (true.th) sending them as they all follow a similar format and seem to arrive with a somewhat predictable regularity.They even have an automated number (*137) you can call and supposedly turn off spam, but it doesn’t work: “System will cancel spam SMS within 24 hour.

Otherwise, phone companies would randomly block each other as part of anti-competitive tactics to push each other out of business.The telephone spammers take advantage of these laws, because it is very difficult to legally block a spam call. Your phone provider must carry all phone calls without any prejudice!(So I&#x27;m about to get very close to the line about hacker news&#x27;s \"no politics\" guideline. Please consider that spammers \"hack the law\" and \"hack politics\" before you flag me. Instead, I would appreciate it if you take a minute or two to fact check my opinion disguised as fact.)The primary way out of this is by a legal change, not by an engineering change or culture change: We must update our laws so that it is very difficult to make and carry spam calls on the telephone network.I personally believe that one way to do this is to require that all phone calls provide rich metadata to the phone that is ringing. I really should know who is calling me, and the phone company that originates that call should be responsible for verifying it. I would even consider a requirement that makes it trivial, or automatic, to \"lift the corporate veil\" on who owns the company that is calling me. Otherwise there should be strict penalties for a phone network that allows originating calls with phony or spoofed metadata.(I also don&#x27;t think anyone has a right to make a 100% anonymous phone call. I think we can figure out how to allow people who need to make anonymous phone calls to make them, without exposing the entire phone network to SPAM.)Ultimately, every phone call that enters the phone network needs to have a strict and auditable chain of liability.In reality, if our laws included a requirement for strict metadata, and then a requirement to make an \"abusive phone call\" button really obvious, we could figure this out pretty quickly: at this point it becomes a simple reputation system.Finally, we need laws that prohibit co-opting the phone network for marketing. We may want to start with prohibiting unsolicited commercial and political calls. We need to make sure that there are no loopholes, where the company you bought something from 2 years ago is still free to call you as if you have an ongoing relationship. We need to recognize that pulling out one&#x27;s phone and looking at who is calling is really a significant burden to us, and that our government should protect us from companies and politicians who think that they have the right to interrupt our day at any moment to listen to a sales pitch.If you really care and want to put time into this, advocate politically. (And remember that hacker news is not supposed to be political.) Don&#x27;t waste your time reading instructions about how to report spam. reply owlbite 4 hours agorootparentOf course, that would require the politicians to first opt their own political calls in to the existing (if largely useless) measures such as the Do Not Call registry. reply cortesoft 5 hours agorootparentprev> If they really cared, they would have addressed it by now.They care, but not enough to spend what is required to address it. reply pbj1968 5 hours agorootparentprevAll the responses to this post have been an amusing read.

Because of this history, the providers have a surprisingly small degree of control over the traffic that passes through their network. This is, in a regulatory sense, what it means to be a common carrier. reply BLKNSLVR 7 hours agorootparentMy admittedly cynical view, then, is that the structure has outgrown it&#x27;s usefulness.Features are being added, which enable phone number spoofing and other shenanigans, at some point deep in the network, such that common carriers, at the tips of the network, have no control over.Thus creating a scammers&#x2F;spammers paradise. reply Scoundreller 9 hours agoparentprevMy own experience is that reporting to Google&#x27;s Safe Browsing whatever is a waste of time.

Spamcop automated the reporting process by looking up the mailhost that the spam was sent from and sent a report to the ISP hosting it along with any URL included to the site hosting it, as well as sites like Phishtank, the APWG, the FTC & etc.Spamcop also ran their own RBL for the emails that got reported to them.Eventually, the vast majority of hosting companies just refused reports from Spamcop altogether and spam really didn&#x27;t get &#x27;solved&#x27; until Gmail came out and Google&#x27;s spam filtering software actually worked.I also use Google Messages for this same reason as they will just catch the majority of bogus SMS spam & I have Bitdefender which catches the majority of phishing attempts.Other than that there are premium options like Robokiller and YouCall which admittedly have pretty funny ways to answer phone calls and waste their time or answer phone calls with the disconnect&#x2F;SIT tones.But when people ask me how to deal with this problem I typically point them to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftc.gov&#x2F;robocalls that has handy info. reply mullingitover 13 hours agoprevI wish we could euthanize this garbage, antiquated phone system.

If they didn&#x27;t bother to leave one it was either not at all important or the vast majority of spam calls. If they did leave a voicemail you can generally tell whether it seems even remotely legitimate and, if it does, call back at the number. E.g. if you have a kid and the school calls they will leave something generic like \"It&#x27;s so and so elementary calling for ...\" you call the school&#x27;s main number back and say \"so and so called looking for me\" and get directed to them.OTOH it seems if you ever answer these even once you&#x27;re no longer a random number to try you&#x27;re immediately marked as a real person who can be tricked into answering at least some calls and will never hear the end of the endless ringing. reply AussieWog93 12 hours agorootparentThis might be a cultural thing, but at least in Australia nobody under the age of 60 would ever leave a voicemail.If you&#x27;re deliberately making yourself hard to contact this way, a lot of people will just stop calling you. reply zamadatix 12 hours agorootparentThis is genuinely pretty shocking to me.

If I&#x27;m in a job hunting phase, I&#x27;ll answer calls from numbers I don&#x27;t recognize during time frames when I am expecting them (e.g. the policy is relaxed for the duration of a job hunt). But, outside of that, it&#x27;s hard to imagine a call from someone I don&#x27;t know that is so important I can&#x27;t let it go to voicemail, but so unimportant that the caller will deign not to leave a voicemail to let me know this is really important. reply mastazi 11 hours agorootparentprevWait a second, do you pick up any call you receive?

My logic is always that if it&#x27;s important, they&#x27;ll leave a message. The landline message also includes the three escalating (line disconnected) SIT tones, which I would like to think helps. But if the spammer uses speech-to-text technology, I&#x27;m screwed.> Instead, report the phone number that the call instructs you to contact.Under the above scenario most callers aren&#x27;t dumb enough to leave a message, and I&#x27;d be concerned that actually engaging with anybody would increase the number of calls, at least in the short term.If you&#x27;re a staffer running the honeypot lines at the FCC, it would be fine because you can go home at the end of the day, but for a personal number I would need convincing.

The political campaigns cycle through phone numbers, so their unsolicited messages can \"taint\" many phone numbers - which will affect other customers&#x27; campaigns.

If yes, take the fax and send the fax to my e-mail. If no, move to the next step. Is the call from a number that&#x27;s on my whitelist? If yes, ring my phone. If no, move to the next step. Play a recording of my voice saying, \"Please press 5 to be connected.\" Keep repeating this recording for 30 seconds. If the caller presses 5, ring my phone. If 30 seconds elapse and 5 is not pressed, hang up.No more robo-calls for me. Zero. Gone. I check the logs and I&#x27;m still receiving many calls a day from random numbers, but none makes it through the test.I know that if everyone did this, scammers would figure out a way around it, but for the last 7 years, it&#x27;s completely solved my problem. reply imiric 3 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s a simple phone CAPTCHA that can stop robocalls, but human spammers can easily bypass it, so you likely don&#x27;t get such calls.I think just sending all calls to voicemail and urging callers to leave a message if it&#x27;s important should stop all spam.

    "originBody": "Lobsters Rails Project This is the quite sad source code to the ghost town at https://lobste.rs. It is a Rails codebase and uses a SQL (MariaDB in production) backend for the database. You are free to use this code to start your own sister site because the code is available under a permissive license (3-clause BSD). We welcome bug reports and code contributions that help use improve lobste.rs. As a volunteer project we're reluctant to take on work that's not useful to our site, so please understand if we don't want to adopt your custom feature. Contributing bugfixes and new features We'd love to have your help. Please see the CONTRIBUTING file for details. If you have questions, there is usually someone in our chat room who's familiar with the code. Initial setup Use the steps below for a local install or lobsters-ansible for our production deployment config. There's an external project docker-lobsters if you want to use Docker. Install the Ruby version specified in .ruby-version Checkout the lobsters git tree from Github $ git clone git@github.com:lobsters/lobsters.git $ cd lobsters lobsters$ Install Nodejs, needed (or other execjs) for uglifier Fedora: sudo yum install nodejs Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install nodejs OSX: brew install nodejs Run Bundler to install/bundle gems needed by the project: lobsters$ bundle If when installing the mysql2 gem on macOS, you see ld: library not found for -l-lpthread in the output, see this solution for a fix. You might also see ld: library not found for -lssl if you're using macOS 10.4+ and Homebrew openssl, in which case see this solution. Create a MySQL (other DBs supported by ActiveRecord may work, only MySQL and MariaDB have been tested) database, username, and password and put them in a config/database.yml file. You will also want a separate database for running tests: development: adapter: mysql2 encoding: utf8mb4 reconnect: false database: lobsters_dev socket: /tmp/mysql.sock username: *dev_username* password: *dev_password* test: adapter: mysql2 encoding: utf8mb4 reconnect: false database: lobsters_test socket: /tmp/mysql.sock username: *test_username* password: *test_password* Load the schema into the new database: lobsters$ rails db:schema:load On your production server, copy config/initializers/production.rb.sample to config/initalizers/production.rb and customize it with your site's domain and name. (You don't need this on your dev machine). Seed the database to create an initial administrator user, the inactive-user, and at least one tag: lobsters$ rails db:seed On your personal computer, you can add some sample data and run the Rails server in development mode. You should be able to login to http://localhost:3000 with your new test user: lobsters$ rails fake_data lobsters$ rails server Deploying the site in production requires setting up a web server and running the app in production mode. There are more tools and options available than we can describe; find a guide or an expert. The lobsters-ansible repo has our config files to crib from. Some app-specific notes: Set up crontab or another scheduler to run regular jobs: */5 * * * * cd /path/to/lobsters && env RAILS_ENV=production sh -c 'bundle exec ruby script/mail_new_activity; bundle exec ruby script/post_to_twitter; bundle exec ruby script/traffic_range' See config/initializers/production.rb.sample for GitHub/Twitter integration help. You probably want to use git-imerge to pull in changes from Lobsters to your site.

I had, in fact, not done so.[2] The bug was later fixed[3], but even today, over 2 years later, my comments remain disowned. They were never recovered. Textually, they&#x27;re still on the site, but no longer associated with my account, which makes them very difficult to find. I&#x27;m still a little salty about that because I contributed a sizeable body of comments to Lobsters that would be at least nice to link occasionally.Anyway, my point is, when pushcx says, \"all banned users get an email notifying them of a ban with the Reply-To header set to my email,\" that&#x27;s only true if at least the Lobsters software is behaving as it is intended to behave.

Did you try discussing the matter with the mods? reply jart 9 hours agorootparentLobsters doesn&#x27;t have any contact information (I later learned they have an IRC channel) so I didn&#x27;t get to hear an explanation from the Lobsters moderator until the topic came up here and ended up getting mediated in a Hacker News thread. The moderator was very clear that I was not only spamming myself, but I was encouraging my friends to spam too. For example, one thing I got specifically called out for was I invited my friend from the University of Tokyo to Lobsters so he could share his https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conwaylife.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lisp_in_Life project. This turned out to be very bad per Lobsters cultural norms.The Lobsters moderator wants new people to earn their place in the community before doing anything that serves their personal interests. It matters not if your self-interests are aligned with giving the Lobsters community what they want. The moderator said they&#x27;re a smaller platform where it&#x27;s not difficult to influence the algorithm, and as a result he&#x27;s very protective of that. You can&#x27;t just play the upvote game. You have to make sure the mod knows you and likes you before doing that. Another thing I did was I used a loophole to help my friend share his project. In my culture, figuring out how to work around the rules without breaking them is considered a highly prized skill. When the Lobsters algorithm said his account was too new to post a link, I thought I was vouching for and reviewing his project link by posting it myself. But the Lobsters moderator took it as a personal insult and challenge to his authority. reply bb010g 2 hours agorootparent> When the Lobsters algorithm said his account was too new to post a link, I thought I was vouching for and reviewing his project link by posting it myself.I&#x27;m pretty sure this would be considered a normal vouching & introduction of a member to the site, if those members did not then repeatedly follow up your introduction with repeated self-promotion (including bonus violation of the spirit of the unseen domain policy). As someone inviting others to Lobsters, you were trusted with a small duty to introduce them to the site properly. For most of those you invited, you were both the person initially posting the invitee&#x27;s relevant unseen domain and the inviter for that invitee. It&#x27;s respectful there to warn new users of site policy that you don&#x27;t expect them to know.When I invited a friend to Lobsters a few months ago so they could post their cool new project there, I made sure to educate them about the self-promotion policy so that both they could continue to use the site and so that I didn&#x27;t become a problem for the site. reply jart 1 hour agorootparentI thought I was. It&#x27;s just no one told me about the Lobsters policy. I consistently violated the Lobsters policy for several years and no one warned me. I&#x27;m just someone who quit her job at Google Brain to build open source code all day in service to the commons. The thought never occurred to me there&#x27;s people out there who view what I do as spamming and self-promotion. Before I got banned, I&#x27;d never heard the word spam used that way, which is why I was so confused. I wish I&#x27;d known beforehand that I wouldn&#x27;t be welcome there, since then I wouldn&#x27;t have engaged. Honestly I think the real victims here are the Lobsters community members. My work still gets promoted on Lobsters, even though I&#x27;m banned. When I publish something new or end up in the news, there&#x27;s usually a Lobsters thread about it. The only difference is that now I&#x27;m not allowed to make myself personally available to my fans, answering their questions, and fixing the bugs they encounter. So I feel like I&#x27;m gaining publicity unfairly since Lobsters denies me the ability to fulfill my moral obligation to serve the people whose respect I&#x27;m earning. reply tedunangst 9 hours agorootparentprevLesson learned: the people who make the rules are less appreciative of the well, technically, I worked around the rule but didn&#x27;t break it skill. reply stephenr 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve read the moderator&#x27;s description[1] of this event and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re portraying things fairly.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36735833 reply threatofrain 15 hours agorootparentprevMay we get a link to your Lisp GC article? reply atdt 15 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;sectorlisp2&#x2F; reply packetlost 16 hours agoprevLobsters has a simple but effective and fairly strongly enforced tag system that makes it far easier to curate your feed than HN.

Like in principle I&#x27;d rather be on the site that had a moderator action log and clear rules about what gets people banned, and I complain about the moderation here plenty, but in practice I&#x27;ll take the site that manages to ban annoying users who stay on just the right side of any written code. reply Karrot_Kream 8 hours agorootparentDespite the mod log and clear rules, I personally find that Lobsters relies a lot on norms. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, I mean my D&D table isn&#x27;t open to everyone and has the norms that come with being a personal friend of mine which are vague and contained only in my head. But Lobsters is an invitation-based public site.Norms are a challenging thing to communicate in face-to-face communications. They&#x27;re even harder to communicate online where all we have is text. They can also lead to the perception of selective enforcement. The discussions in this thread on the self-promotion rule and some angst about how certain topics and community members get better treatment than others are good examples on how the norms on Lobsters feels unevenly enforced by folks who have used the site.My own experience on the site made me feel that the norms around moderation felt uneven. Some topics and some posters seemed to be more favored than others. The lack of clear moderation is what led me to stop participating on the site; ultimately I felt like I wasn&#x27;t in the \"in-group\". Maybe that&#x27;s the point of a norm-based moderation style. In that regard, even if dang has no modlog, his moderation feels even-handed and consistent enough that I never feel the presence of an in-group and out-group. Of course this site is much larger so it might be a volume thing. A ban or a flag of 1&#x2F;8 comments \"feels\" much more impactful than flags on 50&#x2F;300 comments, but probably much harder to detect.While I don&#x27;t post on the site much anymore, I don&#x27;t find us-vs-them dynamics to be particularly useful. They sow rancor where there doesn&#x27;t need to be much.

The top comment on that thread consists of a complaint that self-promotion rules appear inconsistently enforced. Maybe they are, maybe they aren&#x27;t; I don&#x27;t know. But that doesn&#x27;t contradict what I said about Lobsters moderation. This is just another example of the tired message board trope of blowing any complaint about anything into a blanket condemnation. Nuance is boring to write, strident declamation isn&#x27;t.

Reddit will down vote on disagree (depending on subreddit) no matter how the info or opinion is presented, but in my experience where it appears HN is down voting on disagreement it&#x27;s more that the presentation was too forceful.The biggest example of that IMO is people presenting opinions as fact rather than something to be explored. This can be subtle, and in conflict with how people debate or often discuss between two people, but given it&#x27;s a public forum, a sprinkling of \"I think\" or \"it seems to me\" in in comments goes a long way towards not only not triggering some people into down voting, but also seems to promote more useful discussion around the topic as those or others seem more likely to voice their differences. reply corobo 8 hours agorootparent> a sprinkling of \"I think\" or \"it seems to me\" in in comments goes a long way towards not only not triggering some people into down voting, but also seems to promote more useful discussionAgreed on this for sure. My comments used to get more downvoted (or at least less upvoted) before I started pointing out that they&#x27;re just my opinion. Bonus if you mention your opinion on the subject is loosely held and open to correction (personally I love it when someone says something that causes my mind to change! Fresh neuron connections, free dopamine!)Originally I thought that people would just assume everything I wrote without citing any sources is my opinion but I guess folks just need to be reassured sometimes :) reply Rochus 15 hours agoparentprevAccording to my experience rather on Lobsters participants seem to be mostly concerned with nagging. Rarely got a useful or positive comment for my posts there. There is a small circle of users who have a particularly good relationship with the admin and flag everything they don&#x27;t like. I had much better discussions and more useful feedback on some subreddits.I agree that the downvoting possibility encourages misuse. There is no downvoting on Lobsters, but people instead flag whatever they don&#x27;t like, even if there is objectively no violation of the site rules. Actually I would prefer a site where you can only upvote or flag, not downvote, but the admin in that case should charge people who misuse flagging. reply stephenr 15 hours agorootparentFlagged as what though?Without seeing actual examples of posted articles that were flagged it&#x27;s honestly impossible to make any judgement.Edit: I should point out that this isn&#x27;t a hypothetical question either.

    "originBody": "PARESH DAVE BUSINESSDEC 3, 2023 6:00 AM OpenAI Agreed to Buy $51 Million of AI Chips From a Startup Backed by CEO Sam Altman Documents show that OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on brain-inspired chips developed by startup Rain. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously made a personal investment in Rain. Sam AltmanPHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: WIRED STAFF; GETTY IMAGES Sam Altman was reinstated soon after being fired as OpenAI CEO last month, but still stood to gain had the company continued to develop ChatGPT without him. During Altman’s tenure as CEO, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on AI chips from a startup called Rain AI into which he has also invested personally. Rain is based less than a mile from OpenAI’s headquarters in San Francisco and is working on a chip it calls a neuromorphic processing unit, or NPU, designed to replicate features of the human brain. OpenAI in 2019 signed a nonbinding agreement to spend $51 million on the chips when they became available, according to a copy of the deal and Rain disclosures to investors this year seen by WIRED. Rain told investors Altman had personally invested more than $1 million into the company. The letter of intent has not been previously reported. The investor documents said that Rain could get its first hardware to customers as early as October next year. OpenAI and Rain declined to comment. OpenAI’s letter of intent with Rain shows how Altman’s web of personal investments can entangle with his duties as OpenAI CEO. His prior position leading startup incubator Y Combinator helped Altman become one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent dealmakers, investing in dozens of startups and acting as a broker between entrepreneurs and the world’s biggest companies. But the distraction and intermingling of his myriad pursuits played some role in his recent firing by OpenAI’s board for uncandid communications, according to people involved in the situation but not authorized to discuss it. The Rain deal also underscores OpenAI’s willingness to spend large sums to secure supplies of chips needed to underpin pioneering AI projects. Altman has complained publicly of a “brutal crunch” for AI chips and their “eye-watering” costs. OpenAI taps the powerful cloud of Microsoft, its primary investor, but has regularly shut off access to features of ChatGPT due to hardware constraints. According to a blog post about a closed door meeting he held with developers, Altman has said the pace of AI progress may be dependent on new chip designs and supply chains. Rain touted its progress to potential investors earlier this year, projecting that as soon as this month it could “tape out” a test chip, a standard milestone in chip development referring to a design ready for fabrication. But the startup also has recently reshuffled its leadership and investors after reportedly an interagency US government body that polices investments for national security risks mandated Saudi Arabia-affiliated fund Prosperity7 Ventures to sell its stake in the company. The fund led a $25 million fundraise announced by Rain in early 2022. The forced removal of the fund, first reported by Bloomberg Thursday and described in the documents seen by WIRED, could add to Rain’s challenges of bringing a novel chip technology to market, potentially delaying the day OpenAI can make good on its $51 million advance order. Silicon Valley-based Grep VC acquired the shares; it and the Saudi fund did not respond to requests for comment. MOST POPULAR SCIENCE The Race to Find What’s Making America’s Dogs Sick SASSAFRAS LOWREY SCIENCE How to Set Your Thermostat—According to Science CHRIS BARANIUK SCIENCE Cicadas Are So Loud, Fiber Optic Cables Can ‘Hear’ Them MATT SIMON SECURITY OpenAI’s Custom Chatbots Are Leaking Their Secrets MATT BURGESS US concern about Prosperity7’s deal with Rain also raises questions about another effort by Altman to increase the world’s supply of AI chips. He’s talked to investors in the Middle East in recent months about raising money to start a new chip company to help OpenAI and others diversify beyond their current reliance on Nvidia GPUs and specialized chips from Google, Amazon, and a few smaller suppliers, according to two people seeking anonymity to discuss private talks. Brain Trust Rain, founded in 2017, has claimed that its brain-inspired NPUs will yield potentially 100 times more computing power and, for training, 10,000 times greater energy efficiency than GPUs, the graphics chips that are the workhorses for AI developers such as OpenAI and primarily sourced from Nvidia. Altman led one of Rain’s seed financings in 2018, the company has said, the year before OpenAI agreed to spend $51 million on its chips. Rain now has about 40 employees, including experts in both development of AI algorithms and traditional chip design, according the disclosures. The startup appears to have quietly changed its CEO this year and now lists founding CEO Gordon Wilson as executive advisor on its website, with former white-shoe law firm attorney William Passo gaining a promotion to CEO from COO. Wilson confirmed his exit in a LinkedIn post Thursday, but did not provide a reason. “Rain is poised to build a product that will define new AI chip markets and massively disrupt existing ones,” he wrote. “Moving forward I will continue to help Rain in every way I can.” Over 400 LinkedIn users including some whose profiles say they are Rain employees commented on Wilson's post or reacted to it with heart or thumbs up emojis—Passo wasn't among them. Wilson declined to comment for this story. The company will search for an industry veteran to permanently replace Wilson, according to an October note to investors seen by WIRED. Rain’s initial chips are based on the RISC-V open-source architecture endorsed by Google, Qualcomm, and other tech companies and aimed at what the tech industry calls edge devices, located far from data centers, such as phones, drones, cars, and robots. Rain aims to provide a chip capable of both training machine algorithms and running them once they’re ready for deployment. Most edge chip designs today, like those found in smartphones, focus on the latter, known as inference. How OpenAI would use Rain chips could not be learned.

Microsoft declined to comment, and the other companies did not respond to requests for comment. Security Fears The funding round led by Prosperity7 announced last year brought Rain’s total funding to $33 million as of April 2022. That was enough to operate through early 2025 and valued the company at $90 million excluding the new cash raised, according to the disclosures to investors. The documents cited Altman’s personal investment and Rain’s letter of intent with OpenAI as reasons to back the company. In a Rain press release for the fundraise last year, Altman applauded the startup for taping out a prototype in 2021 and said it “could vastly reduce the costs of creating powerful AI models and will hopefully one day help to enable true artificial general intelligence.” Prosperity7’s investment in Rain drew the interest of the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has the power to scuttle deals deemed to threaten national security. CFIUS, as the committee is known, has long been concerned about China gaining access to advanced US semiconductors, and has grown increasingly worried about China using intermediaries in the Middle East to quietly learn more about critical technology, says Nevena Simidjiyska, a partner at the law firm Fox Rothschild who helps clients with CFIUS reviews. “The government doesn’t care about the money,” she says. “It cares about access and control and the power of the foreign party.” Rain received a small seed investment from the venture unit of Chinese search engine Baidu apparently without problems but the larger Saudi investment attracted significant concerns. Prosperity7, a unit of Aramco Ventures, which is part of state-owned Saudi Aramco, possibly could have let the oil giant and other large companies in the Middle East to become customers but also put Rain into close contact with the Saudi government.

Megan Apper, a spokesperson for CFIUS, says the panel is “committed to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard U.S. national security” but that “consistent with law and practice, CFIUS does not publicly comment on transactions that it may or may not be reviewing.” Data disclosed by CFIUS shows it reviews hundreds of deals annually and in the few cases where it has concerns typically works out safeguards, such as barring a foreign investor from taking a board seat. It couldn’t be learned why the committee required full divestment from Rain. Three attorneys who regularly work on sensitive deals say they could not recall any previous Saudi Arabian deals fully blocked by CFIUS. “Divestment itself has been quite rare over the past 20 years and has largely been a remedy reserved for Chinese investors,” says Luciano Racco, cochair of the international trade and national security practice at law firm Foley Hoag. OpenAI likely needs to find partners with deep-pocketed backers if it is to gain some control over its hardware needs. Competitors Amazon and Google have spent years developing their own custom chips for AI projects and can fund them with revenue from their lucrative core businesses. Altman has refused to rule out OpenAI making its own chips, but that too would require significant funding.",

That is a limited downside unlimited upside kind of risk you take to fund extreme moon shots. Boom Supersonic did the same approach with United airlines, to fund a still undeveloped supersonic Airplane. A 1M investment like this is a hedge that has capped downside, restricted to Altman&#x27;s personal money, and an infinite upside that gives an incentive to the founders to succeed. At the time the value of the investment is paper zero for Altman, but gives the founders, who were probably the most promising he has seen in the space, large help with fundraising, hiring, and credibility with future sales. OpenAI does not have to buy the chips unless they meet the criteria, In 2018 OpenAI was one of many startups plucking at a problem that seemed insurmountable. If you are trying to push into a problem and can&#x27;t afford to do what Apple did to build both the hardware and software to solve it, you focus on the one and try to help the other however you can.In WeWork, the CEO took a trademark that costs a couple of thousand dollars, and charged himself millions for it from company money - that&#x27;s personal enrichment.

There are a lot of misconceptions about maximizing shareholder value, even among economists. But talk to a legal scholar or a corporate lawyer: a CEO or board is not legally obliged to maximize shareholder value. They need to maximize the value of the corporation and act in its best interest. Only when there is a change in legal control, such as a merger or imminent hostile takeover, do they have to maximize shareholder value. Just to be very clear: modern corporate law does not require profits at the expense of everything else, and maximizing profits or shareholder value is not the same thing as serving shareholders’ best interest.The company is supposed to serve the best interests of the shareholders, but that does not require an unwavering commitment to profit. What it does require is defined in the company&#x27;s investment prospectus. The CEO and board must act as good fiduciaries but they are given broad discretion to decide what that entails.If you disagree with what the officers think is the best way to carry out these duties, the courts say your option is not to sue them, it is to invest in a different company. reply jampekka 16 hours agorootparentIf the company leaves profit on the table based on e.g. moral reasons, shareholders have grounds to sue and typically win.Why is it so hard for people to accept that for profit means for profit? reply philipov 16 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have to take every profit opportunity if you believe it would jeopardize the long-term value of the company. If the shareholders don&#x27;t agree and want you to maximize their short term interests instead, their recourse is to invest in a different company. It seems hard for some people to understand that as well. Within the bounds of the prospectus, reasonable people can disagree on how to maximize the value of a corporation, and the shareholders don&#x27;t get to decide how to do that. They only get to decide how to allocate their funds. It is the job of corporate management to decide what risks are worth taking. reply jampekka 16 hours agorootparentYes, there&#x27;s a lot of leeway on how to maximize the shareholder profit and on what timescale. But in any case the decisions can&#x27;t be justified by e.g. morals, especially if it means monetary loss (unless no shareholder complains of course). reply philipov 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s just a matter of how you frame it. The view to take is that alienating customers and employees by violating e.g. morality, is not in the best interests of shareholders. Saying that the long term value of the company is best served by avoiding banditry is not only within management&#x27;s discretion, it happens to be true.You can&#x27;t even point to successful companies that treat consequences from violating laws or morality as just a cost of doing business and say that forces everyone else to follow suit. What might be good for one company isn&#x27;t necessarily good for another.The fact that companies advertising on twitter don&#x27;t want their products appearing next to far right diatribe is proof enough that considering morality and ethics is important to maximizing value. reply jampekka 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s still profit maximizing. If they can&#x27;t argue the \"moral\" decision on profit rationale it&#x27;s illegal.LLCs are amoral by design. It can be argued that this amorality can result in good outcomes when e.g. regulated proprerly. But that doesn&#x27;t make the LLCs themselves moral actors.Mistaking companies for moral actors results in folly like letting them regulate themselves. reply philipov 15 hours agorootparentYou are arguing against a strawman. No one ever said that corporations are moral actors. You said that companies are not allowed to have a mission other than chasing profits. As has already been pointed out, OpenAI is not a for-profit corporation. These are a thing that really exists, and as the name implies, they are not obligated to show any profits. You are also conflating 3 things: Profits, The Best Interests Of Shareholders, and The Value of the Corporation. These are all distinct things, not synonyms. The thing that the corporation will consider to be the value it maximizes is something you will find in its prospectus. The prospectus is what lays out the promises the corporation makes to its shareholders. Nonprofit corporations specify their mission, and while their officers are still expected to act as good fiduciaries, this does not mean maximizing profit. replyethanbond 17 hours agorootparentprevOpenAI is neither a for-profit nor an LLC. It’s a non-profit that (confusingly) owns a for-profit arm which very specifically disclaims any obligation to produce a profit. reply jampekka 16 hours agorootparentIf there are no special clauses in OpenAI Global LLC charter, Microsoft can sue if OpenAI Inc if they decline to do something profitable for e.g. moral reasons.51% ownership doesn&#x27;t mean you can do anything you want with the company.

It’s also perfectly normal for a billionaire tech investor with some non-zero expertise in AI to be investing in AI chip makers. (It might seem more strange if he wasn’t.)The existence of such a conflict is not itself inherently a problem; these situations come up all the time, become disclosed, and extra scrutiny is placed on decisions where the conflict is likely to surface.I don’t find it at all obvious that a billionaire CEO would improperly influence the company he’s running to buy from a company he’s invested in over a few million in chips.

Within these dialects, the vocabulary associated with sea ice is even richer. In the Inupiaq dialect of Wales, Alaska, Krupnik documented 70 terms for ice including: utuqaq, ice that lasts year after year; siguliaksraq, a patchwork layer of crystals that form as the sea begins to freeze; and auniq, ice that is filled with holes. Similarly, the Sami people, who live in the northern tips of Scandinavia and Russia, use at least 180 words related to snow and ice, according to Ole Henrik Magga, a linguist in Norway.I find it annoying that anyone would imply it&#x27;s unintellectual to consider this possibility based on such an intellectually vacuous article as the one you shared. replyfishnchips 18 hours agorootparentprevWe the Slavs have more than that for drinking and hangover. Far fewer for corruption, though it was rampant in the 90s in my home country (Poland) and reportedly still is in some other places. reply afavour 20 hours agoparentprevIt could be an example of Sam Altman making incredible investment choices. Or, yes, it could be corruption. Have to investigate to know one way or the other. reply ethbr1 19 hours agorootparentIf the company you control throws a lifeline to the company you&#x27;re a major investor in...Not sure \"making incredible investment choices\" is the word I would use. reply jampekka 18 hours agorootparentprevLiterally incredible. reply newsclues 20 hours agoparentprevI am not a lawyer, but not necessarily.I think it comes down to, is this good for this company. If not and you are directing sales to another company that benefits you, that would be bad, but if buying from the other company you invest in is good for OpenAI, then it&#x27;s ok.You are allow to have other investments, it comes down to disclosure, and not making a bad deal for reasons that personally profit you. reply danenania 19 hours agorootparentYeah and it&#x27;s more or less a self-fulfilling prophecy that any company that gets a deal with OpenAI would also make for a good investment. The only way to avoid this kind of thing would be to say that leadership of a company isn&#x27;t allowed to make investments in companies that are either in the same industry or have dealings with their employer.You could certainly make an argument for that, but it&#x27;s not at all the standard practice currently, so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s fair to single out Sam in this case unless there&#x27;s other evidence of self-dealing. reply l33tman 19 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re directly or indirectly making sure the company you&#x27;ve invested in will get boosted if you as CEO owns a stake. Therefore it&#x27;s a conflict of interest - what if that particular company is only the second best to deal with? Either you as CEO or any middle-manager under you will probably give it some bonus points and it will end up getting the deal, news outlets will write about it, etc etc.At the very least you should let the board handle any potential dealings with the company and have 100% disclosure at all times (as you say) reply mrangle 17 hours agorootparentThe completely anomalous board that specifically doesn&#x27;t have a profit mission and therefore doesn&#x27;t hold the company&#x27;s well being as the first priority? That board is supposed to make decisions on purchasing?What this comes down to is: a. Is it legal? b. Is any grey area worth challenging in court, if possible at all? c. OAI is operating under a weird form of public scrutiny that other companies largely aren&#x27;t, for normal if questionable phenomena like this issue, because the public is suffering under the illusion that they have a company stake (and that somehow decisions like this are indicative of a moral hazard that jeapordizes that stake).Nothing is going to stop LLM (\"AI\") re-modeling of the communal world. OAI will be far from the only player in that process. If anything, all of this nonsense attention on Altman&#x27;s minutia will just serve to distract from anything actually helpful that could be done. reply newsclues 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you are on the board of directors, and also invest in the local power company, is it a conflict of interest if the company pays for power from the local utility?Again, not a lawyer, but I think there is a legal difference between the appearance of conflict of interest, and an actual conflict. reply darkerside 19 hours agorootparentIt is if there is an exhaustive search of multiple competing providers, and the one you invest in happens to be selected reply gwnywg 20 hours agorootparentprevI thought about what you wrote, indeed it is probably difficult to prove either way (unless some other facts are known, like - were there any other companies supplying similar service)I was helping to implement ISO through small orgs (most likely overkill...) and remember one of important bits was that each purchase had to go through a process of selecting supplier. I wonder if this is also the case in OpenAI (I&#x27;d guess it is?). But I also can imagine, if there is only one supplier who provides given goods then the process is not very helpful. reply mrangle 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is the right take. reply louwrentius 20 hours agoparentprevWorldcoinWhoever thinks that was a good idea doesn’t seem to have any concept - nor care for - morality and ethics, in my view.Maybe the board firing him was exactly over this and look who prevailed. reply ben_w 20 hours agorootparentIf you already think cryptocurrency[0] and UBI[1] are good ideas, I can see why Worldcoin looks like a good idea.[0] I don&#x27;t, he clearly does[1] I am not sure, I want to but suspect it will cause inflation unless done very carefully, but UBI needs biometrics to avoid Sybil attacks reply lawn 19 hours agorootparentA cryptocurrency is supposed to be decentralized, but how do you verify that the biometrics that are registered in Worldcoin are genuine in a decentralized manner?The answer is that you don&#x27;t, and Worldcoin is just another giant ball of shit. reply 93po 17 hours agorootparentBoth hardware and software are reviewed by third party audit reply ben_w 15 hours agorootparentThe Black-Scholes equation won the Nobel Prize in economics, it was still a major contributor to the bad decisions which cumulated in to the global financial crisis 15 years ago.Passing audits is necessary, but nowhere near sufficient. reply lawn 17 hours agorootparentprevSo they can confirm that Worldcoin is centrally controlled?Yeah, that doesn&#x27;t help decentralization. reply peyton 20 hours agorootparentprevWorld ID is great.

Think his benefactors at microsoft will complain about the corrupt guy that handed them openai on a platter considering the other accusations? reply tsimionescu 19 hours agorootparentHe has been accused on Twitter of \"climbing in her bed non-consensually\" when he was 13 (and she 4). She has also explicitly said she doesn&#x27;t actually want legal action for \"experiences between a baby child and a tween child\", again suggesting that anything that happened only happened when he was a child. She also has a history of mental illness. reply pseudalopex 14 hours agorootparentAnnie accused Sam of sexual abuse in those words. And even the tweet about him climbing into her bed implied sexual acts followed. She didn&#x27;t say rape as far as I know. But she didn&#x27;t say only climbed into bed either.1 billion people have a history of mental illness. And post traumatic stress disorder is a common consequence of sexual abuse. Does she have a history of delusion? reply gumballindie 18 hours agorootparentprev> only happened when he was a childBetween downplaying the significance of what he did and discrediting the victim i cant tell whether his followers have a similar past or simply bend over to anyone that projects power. I can understand this coming from people in countries where the cult of personality is still alive but not in the western world. reply tsimionescu 17 hours agorootparentWe don&#x27;t know if he did anything. And what he is accused of doing is actually quite vague, and at any rate it dates since he was a child. Not a young man, not an adolescent, but a pre-pubescent child. How much can you hold against someone who possibly didn&#x27;t even understand what he was doing, even assuming she is completely right that this happened (her whole family denies it). reply pseudalopex 14 hours agorootparentWe don&#x27;t know if he did anything. But you did play down the accusations.Most people don&#x27;t infantilize 13 year olds so much. Pubescent or not. And how do you know when Sam Altman began puberty?How much I would hold against someone would depend on what they did to make amends.Family denial is very common. And how would they know?We can say we don&#x27;t know if he did anything without bad arguments or reducing the accusations. reply Der_Einzige 18 hours agorootparentprevYou are being dishonest. She’s accused him of far more than that! But being that HN is ran by PG zealots, actually discussion of these allegations will be muzzled before it hurts anyone’s bottom line… reply tsimionescu 17 hours agorootparentShe has said \"I have been sexually, physically, and financially abused by members of my family, especially Sam Altman and sometimes Jack as well\". This, plus the other two quotes in my previous comment, are the most she has actually said, from what I&#x27;ve seen. reply gumballindie 12 hours agorootparentprevMy guess is that he&#x27;s protected by microsoft and affiliated media. But once he&#x27;s served his purpose and the lid raised the accusations will resurface. But until then he&#x27;d have done loads of damage. reply doodlebugging 18 hours agorootparentprev>She also has a history of mental illness.Was this diagnosed before he climbed into her bed when she was 4 y.o.? I&#x27;m no psychologist and I don&#x27;t know what her own diagnosis involves but it seems that this diagnosis could be identifying a condition that resulted from abuse dealt by someone that she normally would trust.Overall from what I have read the last few weeks Altman seems to be an unethical sleeze who decides how to proceed on everything based on an analysis of what he can get for himself - the perfect type of person who would abuse someone who he saw as being in a weaker position, like his little sister with no thought to how that would affect her later in life. reply tsimionescu 17 hours agorootparentThe point is that we don&#x27;t know if what she is saying is true. I believe that she believes what she is saying, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it true. Per all that she has said, this is a memory from when she was 4 - it could be extremely distorted by now. Even if it is entirely true (her family denies it), he was a small child when doing it - it is very much believable that at 13 he wouldn&#x27;t even fully understand what that means. reply doodlebugging 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re from but when I was 13 I had a paying job throwing newspapers before sunrise. I did all my payment collections door to door though my Mom had to drive me to the route every morning. It was my first job and was a great introduction to job-related responsibilities.At 13 years old, he should&#x27;ve been mature enough to understand when he would be crossing a line but instead he was not taught clear boundary issues. Was it because of bad parenting where they set no boundaries because he was the oldest son or something cultural? I don&#x27;t know but at any rate in my view there is no universe where he didn&#x27;t know that he was doing something wrong. He went for personal satisfaction over everything else just like he does in his dealings today.Pretty funny seeing all the downvotes I get on this thread. I am pretty sure in real life that I would not want to hang out or socialize with any of the enabling cowards who support someone who could do this to his little sister and who could walk through life with so few restraints on his own behavior. Pretty pathetic. reply mlazos 17 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think it matters if he understands, imo if this is actually true (which we will never know) that’s definitely messed up.

His actions today are probably a result of the absence of consequences for bad behavior earlier in life. He learned that he can do these things and get away with it so now he manipulates as a normal course of action. reply gumballindie 11 hours agorootparentprevI am not surprised people havent heard about this.

    "originLink": "http://twitchard.github.io/posts/2019-06-21-life-is-too-short-for-jenkins.html",
    "originBody": "Life is Too Short for Jenkins by Richard Marmorstein - June 21, 2019 ← Home bout nine months ago, I requested a transfer to the team working on the company’s CI tooling. In my judgement, CI was a major productivity blocker for the whole organization, and I hoped I would be able to help improve it and make a broad, positive impact. At that time, CI was in Jenkins 1, which had three major problems: Everybody’s CI pipeline was described in text boxes in the Jenkins UI, which meant they were not version controlled, discoverable, and editing/testing new configurations was a difficult experience. The web interface was dated and unpleasant to use. Developers had little control over the environment in which their jobs ran, because the VMs operating as Jenkins nodes were centrally managed. My team considered two options. Option 1: Switch tools The head of SRE championed Gitlab CI. I resisted this idea because I, the relatively inexperienced manager of a nascent team, was daunted by the prospect of trying to supplant Jenkins, Github, and JIRA all at once. On a previous team I had used Concourse CI to some extent, but I wasn’t really blown away by the experience. Travis and Circle were mentioned. I was a fool. I should have committed to seriously researching some of the contenders and making a more informed decision, but I lacked the willpower and the discernment. Option 2: Upgrade to Jenkins 2 On the face of it, Jenkins 2 seemed to meet all our needs. It: Supports defining your CI job as a “declarative pipeline” that can live as a Jenkinsfile in the root of your repository. Hooray configuration as code! Boasts a UX facelift called “Blue Ocean” that looks more modern. Permits pipelines to request to be run on a docker “agent”, which lets application developers control the environment on which their job is run by specifying a Docker image or Dockerfile. A Taxonomy of Mistakes The worst mistakes come in two distinct flavors: catastrophic and insidious. A catastrophic mistake is like triggering an outage, or deleting production data. The moment you realize what you’ve done is the worst single moment in your career. Your heart pounds in your chest. Is this a nightmare? Maybe in a second, you will wake up? No, it’s real. Hopefully, you’ve got a healthy culture at work, and you desperately describe the situation to your teammates, who rally to your side. Somebody with a cool head thinks of some way to make the best of things, and somehow – maybe that night, maybe the next day – you make it through. Things go back to normal. You write a postmortem, count your losses, and go back to work – a little less innocent, and a little wiser. An insidious mistake, by contrast, does not reveal itself in a moment. It makes you suffer a little bit here, and a little bit there, until one day you wake up and you realize that there is a gaping hole where your humanity used to be. You are a miserable husk of a man, with cruelty on your lips and bile in your heart. You still greet your colleagues with that jolly smile of yours – but the sweetness in your smile is the saccharine of cynicism, not the honeyed optimism as it was in the days before, when life was cheerful and your burden was light. The light in your eyes used to be the hope for a better tomorrow. Now it is the glint of madness. What’s wrong with Jenkins Choosing Jenkins was the insidious kind of mistake. Warning – I’m going to rant for many, many paragraphs. My advice is to skim. The worst thing about Jenkins is that it works. It can meet your needs. With a liiittle more effort, or by adopting sliiiightly lower standards, or with a liiiiitle more tolerance for pain, you can always get Jenkins to do aaaaalmost what you want it to. But let’s talk specifics. Jenkins features: High indirection between you and the execution of your code. For me, the bulk of the actual work of a CI pipeline takes the form of shell commands. are typically executed inside shell commands. In Jenkins pipeline, there is a ‘sh’ “step” that executes the shell. For example sh 'npm install' sh 'make' So instead of writing Bash directly, you’re writing Bash inside Groovy. But: Your editor won’t syntax highlight the Bash inside Groovy. You can’t run “shellcheck” (or any sort of Linter) on the Bash inside the groovy. You can’t very easily execute your shell commands to test them. There are two ways to try and address this: Write your shell in a separate Bash file that you execute from Groovy, avoid putting it inline in your pipeline. Try to avoid writing shell at all – instead, implement everything as Groovy methods. I think #1 is actually the better approach. We started out there. The trouble was, we started wanting to abstract our pipeline steps and turn them into “shared libraries” and so we gravitated toward #2, so that we could share steps easily across pipelines. The trouble is: Groovy is a much, much worse language for executing commands than Bash. Bash is interpreted, has a REPL that is great for experimentation, does require a ton of imports, and has lightweight syntax. Groovy has none of these things. The way that developers test their Groovy steps is by triggering a job on the remote Jenkins server to run them. The feedback loop is 2 orders of magnitude slower than it is for just executing Bash locally. Are there ways to execute the Groovy steps locally? The way you’re supposed to do it is with JenkinsPipelineUnit which is a very good idea – it lets you write unit tests against your Jenkins Pipeline, and gives you an interface for mocking various Jenkins things. But there are two problems: As noted in the README, Groovy doesn’t run the same way on Jenkins as it does in your unit test, because the groovy DSL is “serialized” by Jenkins before running. “Declarative” pipelines are not supported – a huge problem for us, since that’s how we’ve implemented all our stuff, since it seemed to be the newest and most modern thing to be doing. So basically, that’s a huge bust. Especially since we were not a Java shop. My team was barely able to kind of piece this together because it’s our job to work on the CI system, but there is absolutely no way that any of the PHP/Javascript/Golang/Python application developers who need to write pipelines will be able to download Gradle, figure out they need to run gradle init, install the pipeline unit testing library, figure out the proper way to initialize the “PipelineTestHelper”. So we’re basically resigned to the workflow of running shell commands defined in methods used by a DSL embedded in groovy transmitted to the CI master node, serialized and passed to a CI worker node and executed there. There’s a “replay script” feature that lets you edit your pipeline right in the web interface, which helps cut down on the feedback time a little bit if you don’t care about version controlling your changes or being able to use your own editor/tools. I personally am not willing to make that sacrifice. TL;DR, the feedback loop sucks. You’ll never be able to effectively test any of the code running in your pipeline. Your best bet is to build it all entirely in Bash, build your own mechanism for testing it and sharing functionality. The ability to write Groovy shared libraries is a trap and leads only to misery. Low level of discoverability A lot of functionality that Jenkins has in the web UI – especially the functionality that comes through plugins – is also possible to define in pipelines, but the means for doing this is not well-documented. For example, there’s this plugin that permits you to “throttle” a job so that multiple jobs don’t fire at once. that you can see inside the UI. After probably half a day of Googling, trial and error, and thanks to a stroke of luck, I figured out that I could accomplish what I wanted by putting the following in my Jenkinsfile: properties([[ $class: 'ThrottleJobProperty', maxConcurrentTotal: 5, throttleEnabled: true, throttleOption: 'project' ]]) Maybe if I were a Java/Groovy expert I could have read the source code for the plugin and determined this was possible. But I shouldn’t have to be. And the application developers trying to implement their own pipelines for there code definitely shouldn’t have to be. There are two tricks I’ve developed to help the discovery of these magic incantations. Trick 1 is the “Snippet Generator”, which is basically a drop down box in the Jenkins UI with a pretty comprehensive list of options to explore and can help you find what you need maybe 15% of the time. Even if you can’t produce something usable, the snippet generator can give you an idea what to Google for. Trick 2 I’ve had much more success with. Use the snippet generator or Google things just enough to find a function name or keyword relevant to whatever you’re trying to do. Then, go to github.com/search and put filename:Jenkinsfile . You’ll probably find something you can copy and paste. It’s worked 90% of the time, for me. Really, this experience sucks. I don’t really do any sort of other engineering like that, because sane systems have better documentation, more obvious abstractions, and better interactivity. I feel like a script kiddie, blindly typing incantations in to make magic happen through trial and error. Hugely demoralizing. Blue Ocean is Incomplete and Unintuitive Blue Ocean looks more modern than the classic Jenkins UI – I’ll give it that. Unfortunately, it’s missing functionality, so you’ll have to use and become familiar with the classic Jenkins UI anyway. It’s also just not a pleasant UI to use! I’m not much of a design person or a front-end developer, so I can’t articulate precisely what it is that makes the interface unpleasant, but it always seems to take several clicks in places I don’t expect in order to do what I’m trying to do – usually, I just want to run the build, or see the output of the build. Docker It is possible to have your builds run inside docker containers. Jenkins 2 does let the job author specify a docker image, or dockerfile – even kubernetes configurations for autoscaling! So, in principle, the problem of letting job authors own their job’s environment is solved. The only problem is that this problem is solved by incorporating the idea of a “Jenkins worker” INTO the idea of a Docker container. These two ideas don’t always play well together. For example, one thing I kind of expected/hoped for was that, defining a Jenkinsfile to use a Dockerfile, and then giving it a build step like sh 'make test' would be approximately the same thing as docker build . -t foo docker run foo make test But it different in one very significant way. With docker run, your cwd is whatever the Dockerfile defined. In a Jenkins job, the cwd is the Jenkins workspace – which is bind mounted in from the host node. Basically, Jenkins tries to turn your docker container into a regular old Jenkins worker. This makes a degree of sense, but has a number of inconveniences. You probably can’t be root inside your docker container. If your build produces any sort of persistent artifact in the workspace, that artifact will be owned by root and will end up on the filesystem of the host. Jenkins on the host doesn’t run as root, so it doesn’t have permissions to wipe the workspace when it needs to, and you’ll get janky permissions errors. So what we ended up doing is creating a user inside the dockerfile with the same UID as the user that Jenkins runs as. Passed through via a build arg. This is not something I’d really mind doing once – but you have to do this trick for every single job that is defined. So it’s not just something we could solve for everybody on the CI team. Every application developer who wanted to define their own job ran up against this problem. And it’s a confusing problem – it took me days to really make sense of what Jenkins was trying to do. We documented it internally about as well as we could, but still we ended up guiding probably at least a dozen application developers through this particular confusion. You’re probably going to have to define a docker image just for the build. One of the mostly-false promises of Docker, as it was sold to me by the true believers who introduced me to it, was that, if you do it right, you can run the same docker image, and therefore have basically the same environment in production, in CI, and on your local development machine. I’ve never actually see this happen, but I can tell you right now – you’re going to have to define a special docker image just for Jenkins, because of how strangely it interacts with the world of containers. Lest this turn into a rant against Docker – a tool I am also seriously disappointed with, I’ll end here. Long story short, we used Jenkins 2. It kind of solved our problems. So now our problems are kind of solved, which is the worst kind of solved. Postlude It’s a month after I started writing this post. Now I work at a different, bigger company. I no longer work on CI. What’s more, one of the principles I had never even thought to question at my old company – “everybody should be writing and maintaining their own CI jobs” – is just not at play here. There’s a team that seems almost completely to own CI and all CI jobs. I’m in week 4, and I know Jenkins is there, somewhere, lurking behind the scenes. But I have never interacted with it, and it seems like there are a lot of smart people working so that I never, ever need to. What a strange new world this is. Thanks for reading!

The problem with losing slightly there is that the advantage compounds; if developers find it easy to make and share, then they make and share which makes more people make and share and generates tons of value for a platform.It may not be safe, but being able to: - uses: some-developer&#x2F;some-repo@some-branchIs absolutely amazing. Everything else (generally) GitLab has, and (likely) did first, but the social viral stuff GitHub just gets right in a different way than GitLab does.No one would accuse GitLab of being a \"copy\" in recent memory like they did in the bad old days, but IMHO they need to just copy the shit out of when GitHub gets social things (like this) right. reply j1elo 12 hours agoparentI&#x27;m in the apparently small group of people who ignores 90% of the made & shared features, and push back against making internal ops to depend too much to any particular CI system.We know how to build, package, and release our software, and at work I firmly support that we write those operations as standalone scripts that in principle could even run in the developer&#x27;s machine itself. Moving them to CI is just changing the machine that will run the scripts, and that&#x27;s where I draw the line of how much coupling to accept with any given runner: run scripts, inject secrets, and maybe accumulate artifacts between jobs.There are a myriad of things done with Actions, such as preparing NPM, or running Docker containers. I see no point in them, you should be able to manually run the same commands, one by one, locally on a VM or empty Docker container, so at that point why not write them as a script. Use CI as a dumb shell runner. Getting to depend on all those small Actions saves 5 minutes today, only to make migrations immensely painful tomorrow. reply physicsguy 42 minutes agorootparentSame. I&#x27;ve also had to do things like migrate CI when a company was acquired, from Travis to Circle and Circle to GitLab in the past. It&#x27;s very painful to do this if you&#x27;ve leaned into everything the CI service offers. reply hardwaresofton 10 hours agorootparentprevI definitely agree with and do this — it only falls apart when CI environment stuff interferes with file locations and other external state.That said it is nice (if the scripts are simple) to do things like machine set up very easily. reply wombatpm 11 hours agorootparentprevEspecially if you have to run and deploy on your own servers.

I work with (as in write pipeline code for) Gitlab CI almost every day and it&#x27;s absolutely horrible. Not only does YAML lack any type safety whatsoever, but every day I run into yet another open ticket in the Gitlab issue tracker because using a declarative (YAML-based) approach (as opposed to an imperative one) essentially means that the Gitlab devs need to think of every possible use case beforehand, so as to be able to define a declaration & write an implementation for it. Clearly this is impossible, so now I&#x27;m banging my head against a wall on the daily. reply thiht 10 hours agorootparentThat’s not my experience at all. You do know you can run arbitrary shell scripts, and that means they don’t need to think of every possible use case?If your CI process is so complex that YAML + arbitrary code doesn’t work, you might want to get that checked, it’s not normal reply devopseng85 2 hours agorootparentprevI am surprised to hear this as well. We had Jenkins in my previous gig. It worked, but I spend all my time keeping it humming and learnt nothing else. In my current gig, we were a Drone shop.

They also had JWT authentication support built into GitLab before GitHub even had a CI offering at all. The GitLab kubernetes agent makes their CI&#x2F;build tool more like a CD tool for organizations that primarily deploy to kubernetes clusters, which is fairly unique for a CI tool to act as a CD tool, though with scripts people often just make the CI tools do deployments anyway.My experience is limited to GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. I&#x27;ve never been in an organization that managed to crack the code on running Jenkins in a sane way (always a poorly maintained, bloated mess of plugins, unfortunately) so I can&#x27;t say I count Jenkins as a contender in this conversation. One could argue it&#x27;s unfair to discount Jenkins because of organizations that manage it poorly, but there&#x27;s something to be said about a tool that is so easy to accidentally run in an unmaintainable way. I also have some limited experience with Drone and Circle, but not enough to talk about them confidently. reply ak217 4 hours agorootparentprevThey integrated in-repo configuration, self-hosted runners, composable workflow definitions, a robust API, and container building and registries for the first time in a CI tool.Of course GitHub came and blew that out of the water with a composable social actions ecosystem.

Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have fancy UI or flying buttons, nor is it rust&#x2F;PWA&#x2F;react&#x2F;whatever-rage-is-these-days, but it does its job - it works, is free, and has been very well-maintained for ages. Download a single file and run it. Want to extend it? There is a plugin for everything under the sun (but be careful, you can easily bloat it).IMHO, I don&#x27;t want bells and whistles from the CI tool. CI tools are dry; I see them as a car drive shaft - it must work properly, and I don&#x27;t expect it to be pretty. If you need to showcase it, you are probably doing something wrong.And one more thing: I expect Jenkins to be around and free in the next 10 years.

Sure, your artisanal bash script pasted into the shell run of the Jenkins gui is stable and it just works.When you go beyond that is when everything falls apart.

Almost every thing you need for a CI system comes in the format of a plugin, because Jenkins core is too simple.

But I would argue that, its UI is much more complicated and confusing than anything else. You have to install a bunch of plugins to integrate with code repo (github, gitlab, bitbucket...), compute systems (vm, cloud, kubernetes...), you have no choice but install a bunch of plugins, and they changes buttons, menus... I had worked for 3 different companies that used Jenkins, and they felt like 3 completely different websites.To define a pipeline in Jenkins, your choices are either clickops, or the Groovy big gun. There&#x27;s nothing in between. I don&#x27;t have much complain about Groovy itself as a programming language, but if you ask your creative developers to use a programming language to define their CI pipeline, you are gonna see 20 different implementations to detect current git branch name. The biggest Jenkinsfile I have seen has 2000+ lines of business logic. Newer CI products like GitLab CI only allows you to define the pipeline in a yaml file, with a list of very limited directives. That&#x27;s much more conservative. If needed, one can still run a shell step to capture some weird logic in a script, but that inconvenience is a good enough deterrent. reply Nextgrid 17 hours agoparentprevAgreed - I&#x27;d much rather spend more time working around Jenkins&#x27; peculiarities once than constantly deal with change for the sake of change because some PM wants more \"engagement\" to justify their job and promotion.Tools need to be boring and get out of my way - something \"modern\" tooling forgets since everyone&#x27;s paycheck depends on forgetting that. reply dharmab 16 hours agoparentprevThe car drive shaft analogy is also apt because a drive shaft is a precision part that _someone_ has to think about very passionately, in order for others to not have to think about at all.~13m30s: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xyeeksFRnn4?si=924f0OZYDZk7otFL reply atticora 17 hours agoparentprev> I see them as a car drive shaft ...That&#x27;s a good metaphor, and it&#x27;s significant that there are large innovations happening in car drive shafts as with CI tools:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;29&#x2F;hyundai-kia-introduce-new-uni... reply nonethewiser 16 hours agorootparentBasically a dumb pipe in the “dumb pipe, smart endpoint“ dynamic.Drive shaft is a good analogy though because its not simply moving data (unless we’re getting really abstract). reply uf00lme 11 hours agoparentprevJenkins will be around for as long as developers still code.

This means that devs can run it locally as well. The only interaction between a test runner and the codebase should be running `make `.- Put all permissions and code checkout and artifact publishing credentials in the test runner, but no logic. At most you would put processing of test output like making junit&#x2F;coverage&#x2F;tap more web-readable.That&#x27;s it. Split the efforts cleanly, and things fall into place.

DevOps sets up all the permissions and VCS integration, and helps figure out all the AWS IAM stuff. Then we get a nice clean little sandbox to run our build and deploy scripts in, which we commit to version control, including CloudFormation templates. It works really well: it&#x27;s a comfortable separation of responsibilities that allows our team to move quickly with relatively little risk, and it involves almost no hands-on attention from DevOps once it&#x27;s up and running, so they can direct their efforts elsewhere. reply sevagh 16 hours agoparentprev>- Put all build&#x2F;publish&#x2F;test logic in Makefiles or scripts in the repo.

But all the friction points added up to a system that was rarely touched by anyone who hadn’t learned where all the bodies were buried. Over time that meant as an engineering org we were underinvesting in CI; there was a lot of quality-oriented stuff beyond unit testing that never got implemented in CI because the typical dev was unaware of how to change it or fearful about trying to change it. The relative accessibility of Github Actions (and other config as code alternatives) transforms the average dev’s relationship to CI from consumer to owner&#x2F;developer&#x2F;maintainer, and I think that is extremely worthwhile even if these tools bring some new problems of their own. reply ryukoposting 3 hours agoparentAs someone who has only ever been involved in CI&#x2F;CD at smaller companies, I take for granted that our pipelines are maintainable by the developers writing the code being tested&#x2F;packaged.

The typical reason to have it is so that there are dev tools in the dev container (autoformatter, linter etc) or support for hot reloading and then the prod container is locked down. The other pattern you&#x27;ll sometimes see is that the prod container will include an agent or a certificate bundle, although it&#x27;s more common to use sidecars for this.It becomes problematic because it then becomes easy for engineers to have a completely different container for dev then is used for prod.

This means there are no re-builds between deploys to each environment.However, I think it&#x27;s less common to run automated testing within the same Docker image you build and deploy to these environments.This is challenging because you probably don&#x27;t want to include any build&#x2F;test related packages in your production image (or layer) but you still want some level of confidence that your CI and Prod environments are the same.I have often see builds pass automated testing but fail after deployment because our production Dockerfile&#x2F;layer was missing packages or shared libraries that were present in the CI environment. reply mmcnl 12 hours agorootparentWhy don&#x27;t you want to include build&#x2F;test related packages in your production image? Exactly because you mention you can&#x27;t test the Docker image without these tools in the image, you cannot guarantee the production image works as you would expect it to work. Precisely because of that I think any packages that are required to run the tests should be part of the production image. reply happymellon 10 hours agorootparentprev> However, I think it&#x27;s less common to run automated testing within the same Docker image you build and deploy to these environments.When you say \"automated tests\" do you mean unit or integration tests, or both?Because unit should generally be in your compilation process, not part of any image, and integration shouldn&#x27;t require anything different in the image compared to any other environment.Build it, which includes unit tests, and then deploy and integration tests should be run against your stable API. reply anschwa 9 hours agorootparentGreat question! In my experience with ruby on rails, the application runtime is so dynamic, that even unit tests may not be reliable if run outside the production image.I think normally this isn&#x27;t much of an issue because other automated&#x2F;manual integration testing in the staging environments will catch any major problems, to your point.Another example would be for browser testing via chromedriver. I&#x27;ve usually seen this implemented along side unit tests (i.e., prior to the build phase) but since it generally serves as an integration level test for many applications, this has lead to issues due to the testing and production environments being out of sync.I think multi-layer Docker images are a compelling solution to this, but it&#x27;s not usually how I&#x27;ve seen it implemented.Instead, I&#x27;ve typically seen that test and prod environments are manually maintained. Sometimes these are two separate Dockerfiles or some shared CI environment managed by different teams. reply happymellon 3 hours agorootparent> Another example would be for browser testing via chromedriver.That shouldn&#x27;t be in your master image.

You need it for breakpoints and debugging in general but it should not be installed in production. So we extend our production image and install it on top of it. Similarly, we include Composer (package manager) in the dev image only as we only need the installed dependencies in production but not the package manager. Our dev image is a flavor of the production one, really. reply comprev 15 hours agorootparentWould multi-stage Docker builds not help here? Composer executes in one step and the result artefacts are copied into a \"clean\" PHP image without Composer installed. reply twunde 15 hours agorootparentBased on the description they are doing a multi stage build, but using the prod container as a base and then building the dev container atop that. But yes you could easily go the other way with dev building an artifact and adding it to a secure locked down container. This is less typical with dynamic languages that don&#x27;t typically create a single binary, but still comes up. The downsides are that your prod container is now significantly different and for dynamic languages the fast feedback loop now has a slowish build step reply AdrienPoupa 15 hours agorootparentprevThis what we are doing for the prod container that does not have Composer installed yes.But in development it&#x27;s much easier to have it in the image. Additionally we do not bundle the code in the dev image but bind mount it in Docker Compose, which is much faster than rebuilding the image to test changes in development; PHP not being compiled allows us to do that to reduce the feedback loop duration. reply nullify88 14 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, Xdebug absolutely made sense in production just not enabled by default for all requests.

Jira is surprisingly awful at its main job. For example you can&#x27;t have more than 2 levels of parent&#x2F;child tasks (compared to Phabricator which has no limit). Changing an issue to a task or vice versa goes via a complex batch update mechanism. Over-configurability means you end up with a gazillion different task states (Done, Resolved, Finished, Closed, ...). You can&#x27;t do basic things like reorder the backlog based on priority.Perhaps most critically the interface is just insanely slow! It regularly causes waits in sprint meetings while we wait for someone to drag & drop an issue or for the page to load.The only reason it&#x27;s popular is because PMs like to make engineers do their job for them so they can just click a button and get pretty graphs that they can copy & paste to presentations. reply ebiester 16 hours agoparentprevGitlab is 29&#x2F;month.

Groovy is a really annoying language to configure stuff in. I’ve never written it for other things but it has so many little idiosyncrasies that catch you out.2. Jenkins doesn’t have much in the way of resource management. It’s easy for a job to take over the entire node and Jenkins doesn’t have the smarts out of the box to monitor this and put things in a different node.3. So many random job killing bugs that boil down to poor job isolation and resource tracking. Every now and then killing one job can take down another.4. The UI and UX is bad. I know there are better interfaces for it, but they all just have such limited interface exposure of state beyond “running” and “failed”. Estimate time is useless because it aggregates failed jobs.5. Inter job dependency management and tracking is poor and annoying to setup. It’s doable, but really should be a better first class citizen.In many ways, I start looking to other tools to fill my CI need that aren’t meant for CI: Render farm managers.Film farm rendering is largely similar to CI at a structural level. But they have much higher throughput of individual jobs and have built around making the most of that. There’s better inter job dependency tracking and resource management because of that, and they’re built to expose more information up front to help non-tech savvy artists or render wranglers who need to see status quickly at a glance on a few hundred jobs at once. reply gregopet 4 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve written web servers in Groovy for at least 5 years..

The 1 in 50 time a job needs to be kicked off again due to some strange error is annoying though.More often than not, I end up creating a sandbox folder in Jenkins and cloning workflows to work on them by hand without having 90 commits of misc errors and typos. This has helped speed up some iteration.Sort of off topic from the article, I think where almost every single CI engine falls short is the extremely limited scope they cater to - that every job ever made must be solved with the cargo cult ideology where every CI job mustn’t ever have human input, everything must be perfectly automated CI. This is wonderful when it is possible to do, but sucks when it isn’t feasible.Jenkins’ strength is that it’s actually a workflow engine masquerading as a CI tool, and that gives a lot of flexibility for a number of bespoke processes.Do you want to wait for someone to click a button to grant permission to run a job because the test might spin up extremely expensive resources and you’d really rather someone baby sit it? Jenkins has you covered.Or maybe it just isn’t possible (or worth the time) for your team at a point in time to automate all input to a job, so spin up a Jenkins job that lets someone manually specify parameters.Maybe your flow can trigger a release of software but you want a human to come behind to do a manual once-over as a final check, then also capture who&#x2F;why approved it.More CI tools need to accept the reality that not everyone can implement the perfect ideal of CI jobs. Some jobs will require a human step somewhere, be it custom input to a job or waiting for a response. reply demizer 17 hours agoprevJenkins is rock solid.

Our (software in general, not Jenkins specifically) build process are all godforsaken nightmares that would put HP Lovecraft and Rube Goldberg into rubber rooms.

Static typing, maybe even linter warnings as fatal errors, anything that makes adding CI a hassle just doesn&#x27;t exist.Maybe it could even refuse to run without full test coverage.So you could take any project at all, click \"Turn on CI\" and that&#x27;s that, there&#x27;s only one CI config that exists.I&#x27;m guessing the number of use cases would be tiny to nonexistant in the startup centric tech world, but they might be some of the least stressful projects ever made! reply Sophistifunk 4 hours agorootparentThe problem is that a real green-field re-imagination of software development needs to go back to the 70s, and back to the (these days mostly fake) metal, meaning it&#x27;s a massive job that will take years to even know if you might make it. You need to start with something simple-but-useless, and grow it from there, rather than attacking a single layer or two of our current enormous tower of babel. It will be difficult to adopt because it must by definition be alien to our current workflows, and it will take forever to find users. The only way to find success is to slowly and surely build something that is so obviously good existing devs will be willing to give up tools in which they&#x27;ve invested years and (for many of them) their identities, just to play with it.It requires an iron clad vision, willingness to be a pariah among the coding masses and a dictator internally, excellent communication in order to present the vision and progress to the outsiders who are interested, and piles and piles of money to pay for it for years before it becomes sustainable, however you plan to make it so. reply chologrande 14 hours agoprevThe blog perfectly sums up the feelings of anyone who has worked deep in jenkins.

Travis and Circle were mentioned. I was a fool. I should have committed to seriously researching some of the contenders and making a more informed decision, but I lacked the willpower and the discernment.The whole post can be summed up as he had very little CICD experience. Made lots of beginner mistakes, which is easy to do in Jenkins. Then decided to write a post where all his complaints about Jenkins are not only wrong but are the issues that plague all the other CICD tools.> So instead of writing Bash directly, you’re writing Bash inside GroovyWhy are you doing that? You have a fully featured programming language and you are running `sh(&#x27;npm install&#x27;)`. You could do this instead https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DontShaveTheYak&#x2F;jenkins-std-lib&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mast... . How is bash inside of YAML better?> The trouble is: Groovy is a much, much worse language for executing commands than Bash. Bash is interpreted, has a REPL that is great for experimentation, does require a ton of imports, and has lightweight syntax. Groovy has none of these things.Groovy has a language server, linters and a vscode IDE plugins. They are probably not as stable or full featured as the bash ones, but they are available and very few take advantage of them. Again, how is YAML+Bash better?> The way that developers test their Groovy steps is by triggering a job on the remote Jenkins server to run them. The feedback loop is 2 orders of magnitude slower than it is for just executing Bash locally.This is a rookie mistake. For about 60-75% of pipelines you can run them locally in a docker container on your local machine. You can even set up hot code reload so as you change your pipeline the Jenkins reloads it. You can also configure the job to kick off a build when it reloads the code. When Jenkins is configured correctly it has the fastest feedback loop of any CICD tool on the market. GitHub actions comes in a close second since it can also be run locally but you cant run a \"clone\" of what you run in production, like having the same secrets, so it gets second place. Beside Jenkins and GitHub actions, I dont know of any solutions for the other tools.You can run a GitHub action on Jenkins. It&#x27;s a very deep and complex system. It&#x27;s like an iceberg and so many engineers dont leave the surface before deciding it sucks and one of the YAML CICD tools is better. Sure the YAML alternatives are EASY to get started with and to do basic stuff with. But they are Terrible at anything complex. While Jenkins is not easy to get started with, once mastered, you can build complex pipelines with ease.I get that I&#x27;m a Jenkins fanboy. Most of the things I mentioned above, I either contribute to or I&#x27;m the author of. I know Jenkins has issues. I know it has hurt lots of people, I read the complaints online. But it&#x27;s still the best out there. The best software in the world is not written in bash or yaml and the same is true of the best CICD pipelines in the world. It&#x27;s a shame very few people get to see&#x2F;use those pipelines. reply twitchard 13 hours agoparentThis is \"the worst part of Jenkins is that it works\".You shouldn&#x27;t judge a developer tool by just what is possible to do with the tool. After all, with a little turing-completeness it is possible to do anything with anything -- you should judge the tool by what is easy to do with the tool. A good developer tool shouldn&#x27;t require knowledge of a bunch of arcana to \"configure correctly\". A good tool protects you from \"rookie mistakes\" and makes sane choices the intuitive and obvious path of least resistance. Good tools can have a learning curve, but they assist the learning curve by making their abilities easy to discover and experiment with, they don&#x27;t require you to dig into source code or do random searches on github to find some random pipeline somewhere that uses the configuration you need, as described in the post. reply shadycuz 13 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t judging the tools.

In the late 90s, the browser was completely new - so there was a lot of skeuomorphism, borrowing from other media to try to make the web work well. Space Jam&#x27;s format was familiar, though to users of multimedia CD-ROM and other interactive hypermedia of the era.The desktop application GUI - which is really what people are claiming hit the peak in the 90s, really did. Menus, windows, tabs, dialogs, scroll bars etc... all were fairly well settled, and users understood them. A user who knew Word for Windows could do pretty well using WordPerfect for Windows. Most day-to-day applications were pretty easy to figure out because discoverability was very well done, and wizards and how-to dialogs helped users through the rough bits.There was consistency between applications - save in areas where the OS didn&#x27;t really provide GUI guidance - so design, CAD, and other creative apps (hi, Adobe) often had divergent ways of doing things and came with a steep learning curve. The web took off because it actually worked a lot like the multimedia CD-ROMs that preceded it - and websites were a lot easier for developers to build. reply wharvle 15 hours agorootparentprevDesktop program UI design mostly peaked in the 90s (search-to-launch becoming ubiquitous is about the only really good thing to happen since then). Desktop web design peaked somewhat later, in the two- and three-column era. ‘00s. It was nice when most sites looked and worked about the same way, and that way also happened to have great info density for a desktop screen.Mobile web design, I’m not sure it’s had a peak yet. Phone os UI peak was iOS6. reply colordrops 17 hours agoparentprev [–] \"refuses to change\".

    "title": "Introducing Steel: A User-Friendly and High-Performing Scheme Dialect Built in Rust",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/mattwparas/steel",
    "originBody": "Steel An embeddable and extensible scheme dialect built in Rust. Try it on the Playground Getting Started This github repository contains a cli interpreter. To try it out on the online playground, go to the Steel playground. To get started using a repl with the crates, make sure you first have rust installed. Then, clone the repo and run the following command: cargo run This will launch a REPL instance that looks something like this: Packages If you would like to install and use packages, please set the STEEL_HOME environment variable. This will be the location that packages get installed to. Steel currently does not assume any default. About Steel is an embeddable scheme interpreter, with a standalone cli included as well. Inspired largely by Racket, the language seeks to be ergonomic scheme variant helpful for embedding in applications, or to be used on its own with high performance functions implemented in Rust. The language implementation itself contains a fairly powerful macro system based on the syntax-rules style and a bytecode virtual machine. At the moment, it is not explicitly compliant with any individual scheme specification. Warning The API is unstable with no guarantees, and may change at any time while pre 1.0. There are undoubtedly bugs that exist, and any major bug reports will be addressed quickly. That being said, I do use it as a daily driver for many scripting tasks myself. Features Limited syntax-rules style macros are supported Easy integration with Rust functions and structs Easily call a script from rust or via a separate file Efficient - common functions and data structures are optimized for performance (map, filter, etc) Higher order Contracts Built in immutable data structures include: lists vectors hashmaps hashsets Contracts Inspired by Racket's higher order contracts, Steel implements* higher order contracts to enable design by contract, made easy with a define/contract macro for easier ergonomics. Racket makes use of a concept known as blame which seeks to identify the violating party - Steel does not quite have fully fleshed out blame but that is a work in progress. Here are some examples: ;; Simple flat contracts (define/contract (test x y) (->/c even? even? odd?) (+ x y 1)) (test 2 2) ;; => 5 (define/contract (test-violation x y) (->/c even? even? odd?) (+ x y 1)) (test-violation 1 2) ;; contract violation Contracts are implemented as values, so they are bound to functions. This enables the use of contract checking on functions themselves since functions can be passed around: ;; Higher order contracts, check on application (define/contract (higher-order func y) (->/c (->/c even? odd?) even? even?) (+ 1 (func y))) (higher-order (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 2) ;; => 4 (define/contract (higher-order-violation func y) (->/c (->/c even? odd?) even? even?) (+ 1 (func y))) (higher-order-violation (lambda (x) (+ x 2)) 2) ;; contract violation Contracts on functions do not get checked until they are applied, so a function returning a contracted function won't cause a violation until that function is actually used: ;; More higher order contracts, get checked on application (define/contract (output) (->/c (->/c string? int?)) (lambda (x) 10)) (define/contract (accept func) (->/c (->/c string? int?) string?) \"cool cool cool\") (accept (output)) ;; => \"cool cool cool\" ;; different contracts on the argument (define/contract (accept-violation func) (->/c (->/c string? string?) string?) (func \"applesauce\") \"cool cool cool\") (accept-violation (output)) ;; contract violation ;; generates a function (define/contract (generate-closure) (->/c (->/c string? int?)) (lambda (x) 10)) ;; calls generate-closure which should result in a contract violation (define/contract (accept-violation) (->/c (->/c string? string?)) (generate-closure)) ((accept-violation) \"test\") ;; contract violation Perhaps a more nuanced case: (define/contract (output) (->/c (->/c string? int?)) (lambda (x) 10.2)) (define/contract (accept) (->/c (->/c string? number?)) (output)) ((accept) \"test\") ;; contract violation 10.2 satisfies number? but _not_ int? * Very much a work in progress Transducers Inspired by clojure's transducers, Steel has a similar object that is somewhere half way in between transducers and iterators. Consider the following: (mapping (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) ;; =>(filtering even?) ;; =>(taking 15) ;; =>(compose (mapping add1) (filtering odd?) (taking 15)) ;; =>Each of these expressions emit anobject, which means they're compatible with transduce. transduce takes a transducer (i.e. ) and a collection that can be iterated (list, vector, stream, hashset, hashmap, string, struct) and applies the transducer. ;; Accepts lists (transduce (list 1 2 3 4 5) (mapping (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (into-list)) ;; => '(2 3 4 5 6) ;; Accepts vectors (transduce (vector 1 2 3 4 5) (mapping (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (into-vector)) ;; '#(2 3 4 5 6) ;; Even accepts streams! (define (integers n) (stream-cons n (lambda () (integers (+ 1 n))))) (transduce (integers 0) (taking 5) (into-list)) ;; => '(0 1 2 3 4) Transduce accepts a reducer function as well. Above we used into-list and into-vector, but below we can use any arbitrary reducer: ;; (-> transducer reducing-function initial-value iterable) (transduce (list 0 1 2 3) (mapping (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (into-reducer + 0)) ;; => 10 Compose just combines the iterator functions and lets us avoid intermediate allocation. The composition works left to right - it chains each value through the functions and then accumulates into the output type. See the following: (define xf (compose (mapping add1) (filtering odd?) (taking 5))) (transduce (range 0 100) xf (into-list)) ;; => '(1 3 5 7 9) Syntax Choices Steel is mildly opinionated in that there a few ways to define variables and functions. These choices are fairly arbitrary except for the shorthand function syntax, which I borrowed from Racket. defn and fn were really encouraged by me wanting to type less characters. ;; All of the following are equivalent (define (foo x) (+ x 1)) (define foo (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (defn (foo x) (+ x 1)) (defn foo (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) ;; All of the following are equivalent (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) (λ (x) (+ x 1)) (fn (x) (+ x 1)) Modules In order to support a growing codebase, Steel has module support for projects spanning multiple files. Steel files can provide values (with contracts attached) and require modules from other files: ;; main.scm (require \"provide.scm\") (even->odd 10) ;; provide.scm (provide (contract/out even->odd (->/c even? odd?)) no-contract flat-value) (define (even->odd x) (+ x 1)) (define (accept-number x) (+ x 10)) (define (no-contract) \"cool cool cool\") (define flat-value 15) (displayln \"Calling even->odd with some bad inputs but its okay\") (displayln (even->odd 1)) Here we can see if we were to run main that it would include the contents of provide, and only provided values would be accessible from main. The contract is attached at the contract boundary, so inside the provide module, you can violate the contract, but outside the module the contract will be applied. A few notes on modules: Cyclical dependencies are not allowed Modules will be only compiled once and used across multiple files. If A requires B and C, and B requires C, C will be compiled once and shared between A and B. Modules will be recompiled when changed, and any dependent files will also be recompiled as necessary Performance Preliminary benchmarks show the following on my machine: Benchmark Steel Python (fib 28) 63.383ms 65.10 ms (ack 3 3) 0.303 ms 0.195 ms Examples of embedding Rust values in the virtual machine Rust values, types, and functions are easily embedded into Steel. Using the register_fn call, you can embed functions easily: use steel_vm::engine::Engine; use steel_vm::register_fn::RegisterFn; fn external_function(arg1: usize, arg2: usize) -> usize { arg1 + arg2 } fn option_function(arg1: Option) -> Option { arg1 } fn result_function(arg1: Option) -> Result { if let Some(inner) = arg1 { Ok(inner) } else { Err(\"Got a none\".to_string()) } } pub fn main() { let mut vm = Engine::new(); // Here we can register functions // Any function can accept parameters that implement `FromSteelVal` and // return values that implement `IntoSteelVal` vm.register_fn(\"external-function\", external_function); // See the docs for more information about `FromSteelVal` and `IntoSteelVal` // but we can see even functions that accept/return Option or Result // can be registered vm.register_fn(\"option-function\", option_function); // Result values will map directly to errors in the VM and bubble back up vm.register_fn(\"result-function\", result_function); vm.run( r#\" (define foo (external-function 10 25)) (define bar (option-function \"applesauce\")) (define baz (result-function \"bananas\")) \"#, ) .unwrap(); let foo = vm.extract::(\"foo\").unwrap(); println!(\"foo: {}\", foo); assert_eq!(35, foo); // Can also extract a value by specifying the type on the variable let bar: String = vm.extract(\"bar\").unwrap(); println!(\"bar: {}\", bar); assert_eq!(\"applesauce\".to_string(), bar); let baz: String = vm.extract(\"baz\").unwrap(); println!(\"baz: {}\", baz); assert_eq!(\"bananas\".to_string(), baz); } We can also embed structs themselves: use steel_vm::engine::Engine; use steel_vm::register_fn::RegisterFn; use steel_derive::Steel; // In order to register a type with Steel, // it must implement Clone, Debug, and Steel #[derive(Clone, Debug, Steel, PartialEq)] pub struct ExternalStruct { foo: usize, bar: String, baz: f64, } impl ExternalStruct { pub fn new(foo: usize, bar: String, baz: f64) -> Self { ExternalStruct { foo, bar, baz } } // Embedding functions that take self by value pub fn method_by_value(self) -> usize { self.foo } pub fn method_by_reference(&self) -> usize { self.foo } // Setters should update the value and return a new instance (functional set) pub fn set_foo(mut self, foo: usize) -> Self { self.foo = foo; self } } pub fn main() { let mut vm = Engine::new(); // Registering a type gives access to a predicate for the type vm.register_type::(\"ExternalStruct?\"); // Structs in steel typically have a constructor that is the name of the struct vm.register_fn(\"ExternalStruct\", ExternalStruct::new); // register_fn can be chained vm.register_fn(\"method-by-value\", ExternalStruct::method_by_value) .register_fn(\"method-by-reference\", ExternalStruct::method_by_reference) .register_fn(\"set-foo\", ExternalStruct::set_foo); let external_struct = ExternalStruct::new(1, \"foo\".to_string(), 12.4); // Registering an external value is fallible if the conversion fails for some reason // For instance, registering an Err(T) is fallible. However, most implementation outside of manual // ones should not fail vm.register_external_value(\"external-struct\", external_struct) .unwrap(); let output = vm .run( r#\" (define new-external-struct (set-foo external-struct 100)) (define get-output (method-by-value external-struct)) (define second-new-external-struct (ExternalStruct 50 \"bananas\" 72.6)) \"last-result\" \"#, ) .unwrap(); let new_external_struct = vm.extract::(\"new-external-struct\").unwrap(); println!(\"new_external_struct: {:?}\", new_external_struct); assert_eq!( ExternalStruct::new(100, \"foo\".to_string(), 12.4), new_external_struct ); // Can also extract a value by specifying the type on the variable let get_output: usize = vm.extract(\"get-output\").unwrap(); println!(\"get_output: {}\", get_output); assert_eq!(1, get_output); let second_new_external_struct: ExternalStruct = vm.extract(\"second-new-external-struct\").unwrap(); println!( \"second_new_external_struct: {:?}\", second_new_external_struct ); assert_eq!( ExternalStruct::new(50, \"bananas\".to_string(), 72.6), second_new_external_struct ); // We also get the output of the VM as the value of every expression run // we can inspect the results just by printing like so println!(\"{:?}\", output); } See the examples folder for more examples on embedding values and interacting with the outside world.

Typed RacketI almost used https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gamelisp.rs&#x2F; for a project but the nightly feature it needs broke and it&#x27;s no longer maintained, glad to see something similar arise! You might want to consider adopting their choice of VecDeque as a list replacement, I think it makes a lot more sense than naive linked lists on modern machines. reply mattparas 14 hours agorootparentTo answer each of these:1. I do support parameters now, syntax parameters not yet. I would like to! But Racket has a pretty hefty head start on me so it&#x27;ll take some time.2. Right now I have syntax-rules macros, I also have defmacro style macros that get used internally in the kernel during expansion, but haven&#x27;t yet opened them up for user space yet. Syntax case will be coming soon hopefully.3. The odds of me being able to come up with an implementation to match typed racket pound for pound is pretty low. I have toyed with using contracts as types (where possible), with medium&#x2F;promising success in certain situations. I have a soft spot for racket and have been modeling behavior after it, however it will take time to be able to create a macro system powerful enough to match it. It wouldn&#x27;t be impossible to create an alternative syntax to just lower to steel after type checking, but I haven&#x27;t put time into that.On the list type - the list in use currently is an unrolled linked list https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mattwparas&#x2F;im-lists, which I&#x27;ve found to yield much better performance for iteration than the naive linked lists. When possible, the vm does some in place mutation on the lists as well when consing, which helps performance as well.

Then taught myself python just independently doing some projects, ended up back taking a few classes in Racket, then one in Agda that got me down the programming language rabbit hole. Took a class in Rust and that got me working on Steel.I haven&#x27;t _directly_ used scheme professionally except for some steel scripts for automating some work flows and some racket programs for spark query plan analysis.

(Scheme nuances are much better designed, but to a new programmer semantics will look like a subset.)And the Scheme syntax is one of the simplest ever, once you understand it.What should instead be confusing is a language with very different semantics, like lazy evaluation, or an OOPL with complicating dispatch rules to reason about. reply sparkie 4 hours agoparentprevWould strongly recommend watching the SICP video lectures: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;6-001-structure-and-interpretati... reply brundolf 3 hours agoparentprevMost of them use most of the same core idioms you&#x27;re familiar with from other languages, they just look superficially different because of the syntax (especially the parenthesis placement)Try moving the left parenthesis of each expression over to the right by one and it may become clearer(my-fn 1 2)my-fn (1 2) reply mattparas 8 hours agoparentprevAt least for me, there is a certain appeal in building the world. With scheme you get a very small set of functionality, but you use that to implement the rest of the language, and build abstractions on top of abstractions. Seeing how the whole system can be built from a small set of functionality is pretty cool, and also very satisfying. There is a talk from Andy Wingo, one of the maintainers of Guile, where he describes working on Guile as akin to tending to a garden, and I think its an apt comparison. Something about it feels very organic and personal, which is part of the appeal.The syntax itself doesn&#x27;t _really_ matter, it just makes it easy to do so - functions and syntax visually look the same, so it makes it easy to build.Its not for everyone, but I think its worth exploring for a little bit. Similarly I think its worth really learning any language just a bit, if not to just expand your tool kit.

BUT... if that is important to you, you can code towards understandability. so much so that you can make it very hard for others to make mistakes when using the public api.so with most programming languages, you program within the constraints of the syntactic rules of the language. with lisps, you define the language you want to approach the problem, that language comes out by itself iteratively. for some, that is a joy. others don&#x27;t care for it. reply dboreham 9 hours agorootparentHomoiconicity is a gimmick and it&#x27;s a cult. reply Hammershaft 4 hours agorootparentWhy do you think homoiconicity is a gimmick?

You don&#x27;t even have to deal with it yourself to feel its usefulness. Emacs use-package is an example. reply globular-toast 10 hours agoparentprevWhy not just program everything in assembly? High level languages give you powers of expression that lead to better programs or are simply more convenient for the particular task at hand. Lisp languages have several features that aren&#x27;t found in most other programming languages. And a lot features that are found in other languages originated in Lisp.Perhaps what you are missing is the practical part. For that you should look to the two types of Lisp in widespread usage: Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp. Common Lisp is a general-purpose language with a very large standard library and rich set of third-party libraries. Emacs Lisp is a complete language, but only really used to build text editing like stuff for Emacs. There&#x27;s tons of real, effective code out there in these languages.Or perhaps you are confused about the functional programming part. This is only strongly associated with Scheme as other Lisps support other paradigms like object-oriented programming. Functional programming is a thing that takes a while to understand, although my theory is it&#x27;s actually more natural and it&#x27;s only because you already learnt imperative programming, which is thoroughly unnatural, that you find it odd. Once grasped it will help you with other languages that support functional programming like JavaScript and Python.They say learning Lisp will make you a better programmer even if you never use it again. I tend to agree with this. reply SushiHippie 9 hours agorootparent>Perhaps what you are missing is the practical part.I think that&#x27;s it.

In this case specifically, Steel provides the facility to call Rust functions within a Steel program: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mattwparas&#x2F;steel.So, although I haven&#x27;t used Steel, it looks like the advantage you&#x27;d get from using it is the opportunity to take advantage of features it provides like transducers and contracts, which are feature common to some other Lisps as well.So, just like choosing any other language, it boils down to a series of tradeoffs. reply ghc 14 hours agoprevShould have named it Steele since it&#x27;s dragging Rust users half-way to Lisp :). reply wolverine876 14 hours agoparentYes!

We managed to drag a lot of them about halfway to Lisp.Guy Steele on Java reply bitwize 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m familiar with the Steele quote. The manner in which C++ programmers were \"dragged halfway to Lisp\" concerns primarily manual memory management and all the bugginess attending thereto (Java came out before the STL and smart pointers were widely adopted). Concerns about memory safety were a significant part of the impetus for developing Java in the first place. Steele was responding to complaints that he had turned his back on Lisp, by countering that he was instead bringing the C++ crowd closer to Lisp with a C++-like language that had Lisp-like memory management.But the reason why Rust is such revolutionary computer science and, quite possibly, the most interesting thing to happen to PL design in decades is because with safe Rust you get all the memory-safety advantages of Java or Lisp, without a GC because the borrow checker statically guarantees object lifetimes. So Rust programmers don&#x27;t need to be dragged halfway to Lisp the way C++ programmers were in the mid-90s, because Rust has the same memory-safety guarantees with none of the drawbacks of GC. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentnext [–]Java came out before the STL and smart pointers were widely adopted.This is a strange comment.Java 1.0 was released in Jan 1996. (Java wasn&#x27;t very useful before 1.1) However, Stepanov proposed STL to ANSI&#x2F;ISO committee in Nov 1993, and HP released a working version to the Internet in Aug 1994.\"[W]idely adopted\" is an editorial term. It is meaningless without some backing evidence. (\"Never been worse\" has a similar sentiment.) How do determine what counts?I worked on enterprise C++ for years in the mid-2000s that didn&#x27;t use any smart pointers. There are many huge, old enterprise C++ projects that don&#x27;t use STL or smart pointers. And, there are still many huge old Java enterprise projects that use shitty cast-from-Object-type to pass around typed data, instead of generics, or something better. Not much being said here! the most interesting thing to happen to PL design in decades\"[D]ecades\" is a wild overstatement. In the last 10 years, I would vote for LLVM, which greatly improved the velocity of (experimental) programming language development. Would Rust have developed so quickly without LLVM? Probably not. Look at the speed of development in Rust, Swift, Zig, and many others that use LLVM as their backend. It is night-and-day compared to 20 years ago in a GCC-only open source compiler world. I remember the bad old days where GCC was the elephant in the room, but so hard to add and maintain frontends, that few did it. Rust has the same memory-safety guarantees with none of the drawbacks of GCI never saw this before. Are there any counterpoints? reply ColonelPhantom 2 hours agorootparentRust spent its entire innovation budget on zero-cost memory safety! Basically, instead of you tracking lifetimes (like in C with malloc&#x2F;free) or the runtime tracking lifetimes (like in a GC&#x27;d language), Rust lets the compiler do this with a &#x27;borrowing&#x27; system.Borrowing in Rust means objects exist in two states: owned (which get dropped when they fall out of scope, like in C++), and borrowed, which means some other scope owns the object and we only have a reference to it. The compiler verifies that a borrow cannot outlive the actual object, so it statically prevents use-after-free errors.Rust also has a distinction between constant and mutable values, and statically checks that any mutable references are exclusive, and that immutable references are only shared with other immutable references. With this it helps prevent race conditions or other such mistakes.Finally, Rust also actually has smart pointers in case you truly don&#x27;t know when an object won&#x27;t be needed anymore, although the names are a bit different than in C++; there&#x27;s Rc&#x2F;Arc for reference counting (like shared_ptr), Box for owning pointers (like unique_ptr?), and RefCell, that&#x27;s like a runtime borrow checker.Apart from these features that prevent use-after-free and aliasing, Rust also has a feature called &#x27;unsafe&#x27; with which you can bypass all these and e.g. work with raw pointers. Unsafe is generally used sparingly (and if not, attracts a lot of criticism, like happened to actix-web), and the safe abstractions on top also provide more pedestrian safety features like bounds checking. You can skip bounds checking on e.g. a Vec, but doing so actually requires you to drop into unsafe yourself, since the get_unchecked function is marked unsafe in the stdlib.Small interesting side note: I&#x27;m pretty sure Rust is actually doing very little new things, PL-design wise. It&#x27;s more of a realization of theory that has been around for years if not decades. reply zozbot234 9 hours agorootparentprev> with safe Rust you get all the memory-safety advantages of Java or Lisp, without a GCSafe Rust does not protect against memory&#x2F;resource leaks when reference cycles are present. To avoid those, tracing GC is still needed - and most likely unavoidable in the general case. Note that avoiding reference cycles is a global concern that can&#x27;t be localized to any single part of the program, so trying to ensure this statically is roughly as hard as proving that a random piece of C&#x2F;C++ code does not corrupt memory.You can of course stick to tree-like allocation patterns where object lifecycles nest cleanly, and that&#x27;s what the borrow checker is all about. You can also use arenas&#x2F;regions, and future Rust versions will hopefully make those easier to use. replyCooCooCaCha 14 hours agoprevHow does Steel handle garbage collection? Would it be possible to manually control the garbage collector? For example, a game that runs the GC at the end of every frame. reply mattparas 14 hours agoparentImmutable values are reference counted, so for most code, things will be dropped when they exit scope. For captured mutable values, there is a fairly mundane mark and sweep collector. It is possible to manually control the garbage collector, however I have not optimized it for that kind of workload. If you were embedding Steel in a game, I don&#x27;t think it would be explicitly necessary to tune the GC as long as you aren&#x27;t using a ton of mutation. If you were using a lot of mutation and still wanted a relatively performant GC collection at the end of every frame, then the underlying GC implementation would have to be changed or swapped to a different one (which is not impossible - I just only have one GC implemented) reply CooCooCaCha 13 hours agorootparentThanks, I think swapping and controlling the GC would be a very useful feature.In the game example I gave performance is important, but what&#x27;s also important is consistency. Interactive apps rely on a steady framerate so what you want to avoid is accumulating garbage across multiple frames, then doing a single large collection pass.In other words, it&#x27;s better to do a bit of GC every frame than a bunch at once and risk stuttering. reply zozbot234 13 hours agorootparentThere are concurrent GC implementations for Rust, e.g. Samsara https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redvice.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;samsara-garbage-collector&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chc4&#x2F;samsara that avoid blocking, except to a minimal extent in rare cases of contention. That fits pretty well with the pattern of \"doing a bit of GC every frame\".(Note that doing GC over large object graphs will nonetheless involve significant overhead, even with efficient implementations as seen here; GC is not at all a silver bullet, and should be avoided if at all possible. The actual point of GC is to enable computing over highly general, possibly cyclical object graphs - if that doesn&#x27;t apply, other memory management strategies can be used instead.) reply mattparas 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ll make a tracking issue for it - new GC work is fun!

Was this originally a \"just because\" project, or do you expect it to offer some improvements or advantages over existing embeddable Schemes like Chibi (as you mentioned)? reply mattparas 11 hours agorootparentOriginally started it as a school project, which then during the pandemic morphed into something to work on while cooped up. It is really a passion project, working on it is fun! There are some interesting design things I wanted to explore, like how to get good performance out of safe Rust, using unrolled linked lists or vlists instead of naive linked lists, using contracts, etc.Chibi is an impressive scheme implementation, and it will take a long time before Steel can hit the same level of compliance as Chibi. There is not a Chibi equivalent in native Rust that I am aware of. There are other embedded scripting languages for Rust that are pleasant - but no schemes of the maturity of Chibi. So in that regard, I&#x27;m hoping to offer a compelling scheme in native Rust to make integration with Rust applications relatively easy and painless.I also don&#x27;t have a particularly strong need to be 100% completely compliant with the scheme specs. The plan is to have compatibility layers so that portable scheme code can be used, however there are things about scheme that I think Racket (for example) improved on, and I&#x27;d like to explore that as well as much as I can. reply perrygeo 12 hours agoprevFantastic project!

It can be used as a standalone language via the interpreter&#x2F;repl (like Python or Racket), or it can be embedded inside applications, like Lua. There are hundreds (thousands, probably) of embeddable languages, each with their own flavor - see a list compiled here for example https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbohdan&#x2F;embedded-scripting-languagesUse cases are generally for either configuration, scripting, or plugins - so scripting in games, or adding extensions to your text editor without having to use FFI or RPC + serializing a bunch of data. The advantage it has over using dynamic libraries (in general) is it runs in the same process, and can access the internal data structures directly without a lot of ceremony involved. The downside is that it is typically not as fast as native code unless a JIT is involved.Javascript is an example of an embedded scripting, where the browser is the host application. reply tucnak 13 hours agoprevIs it possible to avoid rust completely when programming using Steel? reply mattparas 13 hours agoparentYep - you can write standalone steel code without interacting with Rust at all, just interacting with the interpreter. I&#x27;ve done the first few days of the advent of code in Steel without needing to touch any Rust. Now, I will say that Steel has gotten visibility faster than I&#x27;ve been able to keep up with, so you might find a native function missing, or something that you would like to use that isn&#x27;t implemented yet - at which point you either need to implement it yourself or open up an issue for someone to get to :) reply schemescape 11 hours agorootparentSolving Advent of Code problems in a language you implemented yourself should earn you an extra good star or something. Nice work, and cool project! reply sirsuki 15 hours agoprevWhen I tried to introduce s-expressions to a DSL my co-workers nearly lynched me. The parenthesis were so violently hated I sunk into a deep hole and still haven’t came back out of it. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 15 hours agoparentIt really is kind of frustrating isn&#x27;t it? Because anyone who&#x27;s put any real effort into learning Lisp knows that the parentheses are not what&#x27;s hard to understand, actually. You don&#x27;t even have to read them, really.So when people complain loudly about parentheses in Lisp that just tells me they probably never made any real effort to learn it, and are actively opposed to trying.It&#x27;s not a productive starting point for a discussion. reply alex_lav 15 hours agorootparentCounterpoint: why are people under any obligation to try? reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 15 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re not. But they&#x27;re also not required to flaunt their own ignorance as though it&#x27;s a well-formed opinion. Also, in a professional setting, I find it a bit unprofessional and rude to poo poo technical ideas over trivialities. reply adastra22 11 hours agorootparentI’ve written a large application in Lisp. Hated parentheses before, hate them even more now. It needlessly obscures code.Maybe it’s a personal issue, idk. But it’s not out of ignorance nor is code readability a trivial point. reply tmtvl 10 hours agorootparentYeah it is a personal issue, there are people who really like Lisp syntax (I&#x27;m one of them). That doesn&#x27;t mean anything bad, of course, some people like dark text on a light background, others light text on a dark background. Everyone is different and that&#x27;s what makes the world so awesome.I see something like: some-var: I64 := a * b - c ^ d ^ e;...and my brain gives out, while I find: (let ((some-var (- (* a b) (^ c d e)))) (declare (type I64 some-var)) ...)...to be much more readable, YMMV. reply adastra22 9 hours agorootparentHow do you look at the latter and know the code structure? Are you counting parentheses? Or are you relying on conventions around white space indentation. If the latter, are you not concerned a misplaced parentheses might make the code different from it appears? There could be bugs not shown in the indentation.Most lispers I know code in eMacs or other smart editors that provide auto code formatting and colored parens. But why not just make the indentation (or whatever that you really rely upon) the actual syntax, so there CANNOT be hidden bugs of that sort?Edit: to expand on this, I think it is no coincidence that most lisps remain untyped to this day. Strong typing is about having the compiler enforce type rules so you the developer can’t fuck it up. Weak typing is more convenient, but ultimately a source of bugs. Lisp has, effectively, weak syntax. I don’t like weak syntax for the same reasons I don’t like weak typing. reply dreamcompiler 7 hours agorootparent> But why not just make the indentation (or whatever that you really rely upon) the actual syntax, so there CANNOT be hidden bugs of that sort?That&#x27;s Python. When whitespace matters, any aesthetic reformatting mistake can change the program&#x27;s meaning. With s-expressions this cannot happen. A lisp code parser is completely deterministic regardless of where the newlines, spaces, and tabs occur. You can remove all the newlines from a 10,000-line Lisp program and the compiler will parse it exactly the same as if it were formatted aesthetically.* You can also write a simple program that takes that godawful one-line program and reformats it aesthetically however you like--the meaning won&#x27;t change.IOW in Lisp the aesthetics of the source code do not determine its meaning; aesthetics and meaning are orthogonal properties and you are free to adjust the two independently. This is also somewhat true in languages like C, but rather than several special-case punctuation characters, in Lisp there&#x27;s only one: The parenthesis. Lisp is thus similar in spirit to HTML where semantics and layout are [mostly] independent.* With a few obvious exceptions like EOL comments, and newlines that are part of quoted strings. reply xigoi 2 hours agorootparent> any aesthetic reformatting mistake can change the program&#x27;s meaning.Why would you just randomly change indentation? On the contrary, I don&#x27;t want the indentation to say something else than the code actually does.> You can remove all the newlines from a 10,000-line Lisp program and the compiler will parse it exactly the same as if it were formatted aesthetically.But a human won’t. And that’s a problem. reply lispm 1 hour agorootparent> Why would you just randomly change indentation? On the contrary, I don&#x27;t want the indentation to say something else than the code actually does.Because the user may want the development environment to display snippets of code in various places: REPL, debugger, code browsers, inspectors, various editor types, ...In a Lisp system the code can be data and text. Code formatters can reformat code depending on user preferences, device types (color, font, ...), view sizes, ...In Lisp often code gets generated (for example via &#x27;Macros&#x27;) and this code will be automatically layouted in various view (different widths, different fonts, different detail). Code can be small or large, the system may abbreviate parts, which one can expand, if necessary.Source Code is not necessary static text in a file system. Code can just be list-based data structures and layout is fluid.In Common Lisp the formatted output of code is also user extensible&#x2F;customizable, a &#x27;pretty printer&#x27; is a part of the language spec:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lispworks.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;HyperSpec&#x2F;Body&#x2F;22_ba...If we read a text in a book reading the device, one can also change for example font size and the thing will relayout the text accordingly. reply tmtvl 5 hours agorootparentprevWell I don&#x27;t like indentation-based syntax because when I write code with such syntax down in a notebook I have this bad tendency to drift to the right as I go lower down the page. And then if I go training or something and return the drift causes me to lose the structure of the code.With round brackets on the other hand, well... I think my brain just works with round brackets. Like my mind is coded in Lisp or something, I dunno. It would explain why I&#x27;m so slow: GC pauses. My mind should really be ported to SBCL or something. reply Kinrany 7 hours agorootparentprevAuto code formatting is a must in every language at this point. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 9 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re clearly the exception though. It&#x27;s almost always just ignorance in my experience. That&#x27;s why I used the word probably. I assume if someone asked you what you thought about Lisp, you&#x27;d have a lot more interesting stuff to say than just \"ew, parentheses\", right?That&#x27;s my point, is all.As for readability, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s trivial at all. I just don&#x27;t think syntax has all that much to do with it. It plays a role, but a very minor one compared to overall code quality. In other words it&#x27;s syntax that&#x27;s mostly a trivial point, not readablity.One undeniable advantage of Lisp in terms of syntactic readability though is that other languages always end up piling on more syntax over time as the language gets older. That&#x27;s by far my least favourite thing about Rust for instance, even though I do love the language. There&#x27;s always some new syntax, keyword, or position that an existing keyword can suddenly go in. The longer I go without actively using Rust, the more work it is to start again, because I have to go learn all this new stuff now. And syntax always takes a while to feel intuitive, at least for me. But it&#x27;s still a lot easier than grokking new semantics and paradigms. I still don&#x27;t have a good handle on async rust.If someone told me to go read some ALGOL 68, I could probably do just fine because there&#x27;s nothing semantically unfamiliar about it compared to something like C. But if someone gave me some Haskell written as sexps I would be utterly lost despite the syntax being perfectly comfortable to me. Because I never quite grokked typed FP. reply adastra22 8 hours agorootparentNo, the horrible syntax of lisp is pretty much all I have to say on it, honestly. I don’t care for lisp for the same reason I don’t care for perl: write-only languages are a bigger hinderence to software maintenance than whatever advantage might be obtained. And the advantages of lisp have long since been obtained by other languages. reply alex_lav 15 hours agorootparentprev> But they&#x27;re also not required to flaunt their own ignorance as though it&#x27;s a well-formed opinion.I don’t like the parenthesis. I’m not flaunting anything. Is it “flaunting” to calmly and respectfully share an opinion? To you it’s trivial, to me it’s not.It seems like you’re interested in creating conflict with people that don’t like a thing that you like. Which, I would cast this behavior as unprofessional, tbh. reply CooCooCaCha 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not a fan of the parenthesis either, but when I learned about s-expressions and how lisp programs are also a data structures that piqued my interest and helped me look past them.I question people&#x27;s judgement who can&#x27;t look past the syntax when there is a very good, and interesting technical reason behind them. reply arnsholt 14 hours agorootparentCode as data is interesting, but mostly orthogonal to S expressions.

You show how something would be with s-expressions, compared to something, and all they can focus on is how many parenthesis there are.

And when you remove the parenthesis, they can kind of understand the code, kind of. reply fwip 15 hours agorootparentOne option that might be suitable for a DSL, is implicit parens based on whitespace. A newline opens a new paren, and the paren closes when it reaches another line with the same indentation e.g: (defun factorial (x) (if (zerop x) 1 (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))could be rewritten as defun factorial (x) if (zerop x) 1 * x (factorial (- x 1)) reply nsajko 15 hours agorootparentExisting SRFI: SRFI 49 \"Indentation-sensitive syntax\":https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srfi.schemers.org&#x2F;srfi-49&#x2F;srfi-49.html reply Syzygies 8 hours agorootparentI doubt that SRFI 49, or any other proposal I&#x27;ve seen online, has been battle-tested.I&#x27;ve written thousands of lines of Scheme using my own preprocessor, and it&#x27;s my favorite code to look at. I prefer Haskell, for incredible ease of parallelism and a deeper mathematical foundation.The two features I look for in a reduced parenthesis syntax (like looking for the bone marrow in a beef stew recipe) are:1. Some constructions begin doubly parenthesized. One needs a symbol to represent the missing object one parenthesis in. I use $.2. One can write more expressive lines with a flavor of open paren that autocloses at the end of the line.

Being HN, here is my nitpicking imperative:Names are important. Our inheritance is wit, self-awareness, and irony; names that puncture ego and power and that appeal to joy: C, C++, GNU, Rust, Google, Yahoo!, Vim, Git, awk, etc. Others are beautiful, evocative images, like Apple and Amazon. Names communicate our culture and ideals to each other and to the next generation.Careless, thoughtless names like Microsoft, IBM, etc. (ok it&#x27;s ironic and self-deprecating, but without self-awareness or wit!), etc. should be hated and banned. Egotistical BS, especially Tolkien plagiarists who assert they are supernatural, should be tarred and feathered and paraded around town (with wit and irony).(Plenty of names fall in some middle ground.)If Steel is just a derivative of &#x27;Rust&#x27; [edit: it is not, see the response below], it misses the self-awareness. Someone naming their development product - designed to build great structures - &#x27;Rust&#x27; is engaging in a little self-deprication, joy, and self-awareness. Naming the derivative project &#x27;Steel&#x27; possibly misses all that; there&#x27;s a reason the original wasn&#x27;t named Iron or Steel or Carbon Fiber. But maybe there&#x27;s more to the name. reply mattparas 14 hours agoparentSo here is the history:1.

In this study, we present novel experimental insights into the resilience of LLMs, particularly GPT-4, when subjected to extensive character-level permutations. To investigate this, we first propose the Scrambled Bench, a suite designed to measure the capacity of LLMs to handle scrambled input, in terms of both recovering scrambled sentences and answering questions given scrambled context. The experimental results indicate that most powerful LLMs demonstrate the capability akin to typoglycemia, a phenomenon where humans can understand the meaning of words even when the letters within those words are scrambled, as long as the first and last letters remain in place. More surprisingly, we found that only GPT-4 nearly flawlessly processes inputs with unnatural errors, even under the extreme condition, a task that poses significant challenges for other LLMs and often even for humans. Specifically, GPT-4 can almost perfectly reconstruct the original sentences from scrambled ones, decreasing the edit distance by 95%, even when all letters within each word are entirely scrambled. It is counter-intuitive that LLMs can exhibit such resilience despite severe disruption to input tokenization caused by scrambled text.

For example, it can translate this: UNDERNEATHTHEGAZEOFORIONSBELTWHERETHESEAOFTRA NQUILITYMEETSTHEEDGEOFTWILIGHTLIESAHIDDENTROV EOFWISDOMFORGOTTENBYMANYCOVETEDBYTHOSEINTHEKN OWITHOLDSTHEKEYSTOUNTOLDPOWERTo this: Underneath the gaze of Orion&#x27;s belt, where the Sea of Tranquility meets the edge of twilight, lies a hidden trove of wisdom, forgotten by many, coveted by those in the know. It holds the keys to untold power.(The prompt was, \"Segment and punctuate this text: {text}\".)This was interesting because word segmentation is a difficult problem that is usually thought to require something like dynamic programming[1][2] to get right. It&#x27;s a little surprising that GPT-4 can handle this, because it has no capability to search different alternatives to backtrack if it makes a mistake, but apparently it&#x27;s stronger understanding of language means that it doesn&#x27;t really need to.It&#x27;s also surprising that tokenization doesn&#x27;t appear to interfere with its ability to these tasks, because it seems like it would make things a lot harder. According to the openAI tokenizer[3], GPT-4 sees the following tokens in the above text: UNDER NE AT HT HE GA Z EOF OR ION SB EL TW HER ET HE SEA OF TRAExcept for \"UNDER\", \"SEA\", and \"OF\", almost all of those token breaks are not at natural word boundaries. The same is true for the scrambled text examples in the original article. So GPT-4 must actually be taking those tokens apart into individual letters and gluing them back together into completely new tokens somewhere inside it&#x27;s many layers of transformers.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.cs.wpi.edu&#x2F;~cs2223&#x2F;b05&#x2F;HW&#x2F;HW6&#x2F;SolutionsHW6&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;wordsegmentation&#x2F;[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.openai.com&#x2F;tokenizer reply usaar333 15 hours agoparentInteresting for the hard example of #2, it outperforms the project, though I credit this to memorization (given that it is able to reproduce the correct stanza and punctuation for \"Spring and Fall, to a Young Child\").FWIW, the only reason you need DP to get it \"right\" is because, well, you want it right. A human can of course generally split words with just a language model in 1-pass, as long as you don&#x27;t have ambiguous text.

Den Namen Leo bzw. Leone, mit dem er in der moder­nen Literatur meist bezeich­net wird, legte er sich erst als Erwach­sener an. Abra­vanel gehörte zu den promi­nenten Vertre­tern des Platonis­mus in der Renais­sance. Er verfügte über eine hervor­ragende huma­nisti­sche Bil­dung und kannte sich in der christ­lichen ebenso wie in der jüdi­schen und der islami­schen philo­sophi­schen Tradi­tion aus. Sein Haupt­werk, die Dialoghi d’amore („Dialoge über die Liebe“), knüpft an Platons Konzept des litera­risch kunst­voll gestal­teten philo­sophi­schen Dialogs an. Wie bei Platon und in der tradi­tionel­len belehren­den Dialog­litera­tur bemühen sich in den Dialoghi d’amore die Ge­sprächs­part­ner gemein­sam um Erkennt­nis. Abra­vanel wandelt jedoch das her­kömm­liche Konzept ab, indem er an die Stelle des übli­chen Lehrer-Schüler-Ver­hältnis­ses der Dialog­teilneh­mer einen Gedanken­aus­tausch und zugleich geisti­gen Kampf zweier eben­bürtiger Ge­sprächs­partner setzt.Hint: It doesn&#x27;t fare quite as well ;) reply frabcus 19 hours agoparentprevI see this slightly the other way round - the difficulties caused by tokenisation are why it is good at segmentation.

There are also elements that look like parts of a silver car, like a side mirror, and segments of wooden structures that could be parts of a bench or a deck.The way the images are scrambled resembles a puzzle, where each piece needs to be placed correctly to form a coherent whole.

You&#x27;re rapidly failing to interpret each scrambled word as its unscrambled form. You&#x27;re sampling letters, failing, and trying again, over and over, until you eventually succeed, and then moving on to the next word. Maybe you&#x27;re even backtracking to previous words that you got wrong (now&#x2F;won perhaps) based on later unscramblings. And you&#x27;re ignoring that part and only evaluating the very final outcome in a binary \"got to the marathon finish line\" fashion while ignoring the shortness of breath and stitch in your side.The entire reason it takes longer is because you have a low rate of intermediate success, which makes progress slow, even though you got there in the end.> I measured in units of minutes because the largest unit below that is the second\"Seconds\" is an extremely common descriptor for how long something might take.

I think we are generally just try to reason through this phenomena, not make grand conclusions about the model. We talk about how hard&#x2F;time consuming it is for a human to pose possible theories for what the LLM could be doing. It is not to assert anything about how \"difficult\" it is for the LLM compared to a human, because we can&#x27;t ascribe difficulty&#x2F;ease to anything the model \"does\", simply because we know the fundamental mechanics of its inferencing. We can only after the fact of an LLM&#x27;s output say something like: \"Wow that would have been hard for me to output\" or \"I could have written something similar in like 5 minutes.\" But these claims can only ever be counter factuals like this, because in reality the output of an llm comes out at a constant rate no matter what you prompt it with.If you try to say more, you&#x27;ll end up falling in weird contradictions: it would take an llm a lot longer to output 10 million &#x27;a&#x27;s than a human, so it must be \"harder\" for the llm to do that than a human. reply bravetraveler 19 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t forget to compare reading and digesting to make it fair!

Our hands are our primary mechanism for interacting with the world in a conscious and directed fashion. We devote a lot of mental attention to them, how to use them, how other people are using them. That&#x27;s true subjectively, but you can also read it off of the Cortical Homunculus findings [1]. In short, though, we&#x27;re extremely sensitive to whether hands are rendered properly and meaningfully.And, then, unlike faces, there is relatively little visual data in the world showing exactly how hands work. Unlike faces they&#x27;re not often the focal point of an image. Unlike faces, they don&#x27;t present mostly forward and so in any particular image their visualization is only partial. Unlike faces hands are often defined by how they interact with any other complex object in a scene.So we&#x27;re both tough critics of hands and image models have relatively less training data.For what it&#x27;s worth, as well, it&#x27;s evident that image models are only good at depicting many things gesturally. At the same time, so are painters. If you&#x27;re a photographer, you can often spot fake images if you notice that the exposure, focus, or lighting is implausible. If you&#x27;re a mathematician, you&#x27;ll notice every chalkboard full of equations is nonsense in both AI images and most Hollywood movies. If you&#x27;re a botanist, I&#x27;m sure you think every AI image with a background of trees looks weird.And then it turns out that nearly every human being is a hand-ologist to a large degree.For another interesting experience, take a look at the Clone synthetic hand [2] which is quite obviously artificial but also, from time to time, looks surprisingly human. We&#x27;re quite clearly sensitive to exactly the musculature and range of motion of our hands and know exactly what&#x27;s feasible, what&#x27;s painful, what feels natural and unnatural given the exact constraints of how our hand is constructed. When those limits are probed it&#x27;s immediately obvious.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cortical_homunculus [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=A4Gp8oQey5M&t=20s reply timacles 17 hours agorootparentYou’re partially correct, but this isn’t an explanation for why they’re rendered wrongHands are extremely complicated mechanically. They are the most complex creation evolution has come up with and part of the reason humans are able to do what they do.Hands are like the chess game of anatomy, each segment of a hand has so many permutations that an AI simply doesn’t have enough reference info to animate it properly reply tel 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think we disagree, and I do think what I argue is sufficient for image generation models to fail to render hands well. What you add---that they are very complex---is true, I believe, but I avoided using it to argue as I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s sufficient or necessary.Generative models, arguable, have little trouble with complexity given enough training data. Faces are a perfect example. We both agree that image models, at least, lack that data for hands.But there are many complex things that image models render with sparse training data which don&#x27;t set off our perception as strongly. Hands fall into the uncanny valley: we are deeply familiar with them.This is why I mention lighting and focus. They are subtle and complex. Additionally, image models have tons of training examples of each. That&#x27;s still not enough for generative image models to consistently represent photography in a way that a person who has spent the time to build an accurate model of how camera images look would be fooled. But it fools most people.The complexity of handling good lighting and focus involve both the generation of the entire scene that the photograph is taking place within and an accurate model of both the design of the camera and how it&#x27;s been configured for the shot. Both of these are large spaces full of hidden variables that popular image models are not presently trained on.Many people know you can look at the background of a generated image to identify irregularities. Checking that the lighting has a consistent angle (or multiple angles indicative of a cogent set of scene lights) is another good check. Additionally, if you have an eye for bokeh then when it appears in an image you can often detect whether it&#x27;s faked. Finally, even smooth blurs often do not reflect either a physically plausible background being blurred or a consistent focal plane cutting through the 3d scene. All additional complexities that image generating models often don&#x27;t have mastery over (for now). But also many judges of their outputs don&#x27;t either, so it&#x27;s easy to miss these \"mistakes\". reply Terretta 6 hours agoparentprevThe problem with hands is that more fingers are between fingers than to left or right of fingers.So, a finger should probably be portrayed as between other fingers.You can see where this is going. It can&#x27;t. reply seanhunter 19 hours agoparentprevPerhaps the hand is an example of something for which you really need an actual model of the anatomy to draw convincingly whereas lots of other things (eg faces) a very simple proximity model will generate just fine. Since a diffusion model doesn&#x27;t have an actual conceptual model of the things it generates (it literaly just learns to remove noise from training images and then eventually \"removes the noise\" from a totally random bitstream until it generates your image).It&#x27;s interesting that lots of artists practise sketching using wooden models of a hand that they can pose in different ways.[1][1] This type of thing can be found in most art shops https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quickdrawsupplies.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;8-20cm-artists-pos... reply Closi 19 hours agoparentprevHumans also struggle to draw hands.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-is-the-hardest-body-part-for-an-a... reply Retric 17 hours agorootparentThere’s a scale here.

Hands haven’t been a problem for image generators since last years. reply code_runner 20 hours agoparentprevmaybe its just that peoples hands are all such different shapes, proportions, in odd positions, not fully visible.... but something like \"this muscle runs between the elbow and wrist\" is just easier for the model to pick up on... it has \"anchor points\".Facial features and fingers just.... are hanging off the body in extremely non-uniform ways w&#x2F; no real set proportions.

Bad tokens in don&#x27;t necessarily mean bad tokens out....I&#x27;m sure there is a limit to how many tokens can be flat out bad before the \"next token\" in the response is thrown off, but after seeing what it can do with some of these inputs, the fact it can unscramble is not at all surprising&#x2F;interesting. reply thesz 19 hours agoparentThere are character embeddings that allow one to recover word embedding just by summing embeddings of individual bytes&#x2F;chars in the word: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sonlamho&#x2F;Char2VecThe encodings of LM&#x27;s tokens reserve individual characters so that scrambled or new words can be encoded. And most LM&#x27;s are trained on scrambled words as part of training copus, thus, they learn character-level embeddings.Thus, basically, the paper is a very old news. This behavior is expected. reply BoiledCabbage 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m open to being corrected, but I feel that your statement is missing the point. An embedding can trivially have char embedding that sum to word embeddings, or it can have word embeddings that well represent semantic concepts, but it&#x27;s not at all trivial to preserve both constraints simultaneously like you make it out to be. The constraints of adding a letter to a word won&#x27;t consistently shift it in one direction that will also capture the semantic meaning of that vector shift.Or to give a more concrete example \"despair\", \"aspired\", \"daipers\", and \"praised\" are all anagrams. If summing the embeddings of characters produces words, then the embedding of all 4 of those words must be identical. That significantly constrains semantic differentiation between those 4 very different words.What&#x27;s going on is more complex than what you&#x27;ve stated - and put simply, if reserving single characters embeddings was all that was needed to produce this result then all the llms would produce these results successfully. They don&#x27;t - and that demonstrate that those two models are more \"powerful\"&#x2F;\"adept\" than the others. reply Der_Einzige 18 hours agorootparentprevYou’re only being downvoted because the average NLP knowledge here is low, but you are 100% correct that this paper is very old news. reply xrd 21 hours agoprevI didn&#x27;t read the full text but I did notice that the authors are 75% Japanese names and one other person who I&#x27;m assuming is of Chinese heritage.

If you scramble words at the character level, you are going to produce combinations of letters that don&#x27;t match any known symbol. It would be like drawing a series of random strokes and asking someone who knows Chinese what it means.If you look at the example given in the paper, the word \"won\" is a single token. When it is scrambled as \"wno\" it is tokenised as \"w\" and \"no\" both of which are unrelated to the original token \"won\". Somehow the LLM is able to relate these two completely different tokens \"w\" and \"no\" back to the original token \"won\". I think the paper is claiming this is surprising because these tokens shouldn&#x27;t have any correlation with each other in its training data. reply evertedsphere 20 hours agorootparentPartial counterpoint: if you were to mutate characters (by changing less distinctive components to other vaguely similar-looking ones) or to reorder the order of characters in hanzi&#x2F;kanji compounds, I would imagine that a native speaker would still be able to read them with some difficulty.I can attempt to produce a Japanese example by going to town on an example from Jreibun, but note that I am far from native:後食に罠くなるのは生里像現なので壁けることはできないが、午後の事士の校率が干がるので木っている。As far as I&#x27;m concerned, swapping out the radicals doesn&#x27;t hurt that much (this is usually a negative, since it leads you to confuse character pairs like 候 and 侯, especially if you don&#x27;t practice writing) and swapping the order of characters is a bit more annoying.That said, a Mandarin one would be more convincing, since reordering the various markers that serve the roles of Japanese verb conjugations would be less disruptive than turning できなかった into っぎかてなた, which I did not do for that reason.--(The original sentence was 食後に眠くなるのは生理現象なので避けることはできないが、午後の仕事の効率が下がるので困っている。) reply xondono 19 hours agorootparentprevLike GP, I’m not sure I find it very surprising.Presumably chatGPT has not only lots of typos in it’s training data, but also even nearly scrambled text with things like Pig Latin.In a sense being able to process scrambled text is an overpowered version of typo tolerance. reply thaumasiotes 20 hours agorootparentprev> If you scramble words at the character level, you are going to produce combinations of letters that don&#x27;t match any known symbol.

Even with Q* I would be skeptical about its accuracy for the depth of calculations involved.Then there&#x27;s the annually changing tax code that has been intentionally made complex, and the training data is surely full of explanations based on outdated details. Maybe significant fine-tuning with the most up to date tax code, and&#x2F;or putting it in the preface of the context, that can be somewhat nullified.Even for a financial strategy, other than the very high level of hedging on different asset classes, some basics of estate management and some strategies like bond ladders and periodic redistribution of stock holdings.... an LLM isn&#x27;t going to be very useful. And those high level strategies are shared broadly, you can definitely learn them without referring to an LLM.Also, for some of the same reasons I wouldn&#x27;t ask my financial advisor which stocks to pick, I wouldn&#x27;t expect an LLM to give me good answers on a specific active portfolio: the notion \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" persists because it&#x27;s not a half bad strategy, and even a current-up-to-the-moment model would be chasing the tail end (although, I suppose, if it were able to take advantage of information shared by many other users&#x27; prompts, it could benefit from more than just the news cycle). Predicting the shape of fluent prose does not directly map to predicting the shape of market activity, even if it has internalized some kind of Mean Field Theory to help approximate it functionally. I&#x27;ll admit I would be curious what it said, though.Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like LLMs for many tasks, just not for taxes or financial strategy. I wouldn&#x27;t fault someone for doing it but I would want to inform of the above to anyone considering it, even with a more competent or super-intelligent LLM.

It eases the exploration of APIs that return large blobs of JSON but have terrible documentation. ▶ gron \"https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1\"fgrep \"commit.author\" json[0].commit.author = {}; json[0].commit.author.date = \"2016-07-02T10:51:21Z\"; json[0].commit.author.email = \"mail@tomnomnom.com\"; json[0].commit.author.name = \"Tom Hudson\"; gron can work backwards too, enabling you to turn your filtered data back into JSON: ▶ gron \"https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1\"fgrep \"commit.author\"gron --ungron [ { \"commit\": { \"author\": { \"date\": \"2016-07-02T10:51:21Z\", \"email\": \"mail@tomnomnom.com\", \"name\": \"Tom Hudson\" } } } ] Disclaimer: the GitHub API has fantastic documentation, but it makes for a good example. Installation gron has no runtime dependencies. You can just download a binary for Linux, Mac, Windows or FreeBSD and run it. Put the binary in your $PATH (e.g. in /usr/local/bin) to make it easy to use: ▶ tar xzf gron-linux-amd64-0.1.5.tgz ▶ sudo mv gron /usr/local/bin/ If you're a Mac user you can also install gron via brew: ▶ brew install gron Or if you're a Go user you can use go install: ▶ go install github.com/tomnomnom/gron@latest It's recommended that you alias ungron or norg (or both!) to gron --ungron. Put something like this in your shell profile (e.g. in ~/.bashrc): alias norg=\"gron --ungron\" alias ungron=\"gron --ungron\" Or you could create a shell script in your $PATH named ungron or norg to affect all users: gron --ungron \"$@\" Usage Get JSON from a file: ▶ gron testdata/two.json json = {}; json.contact = {}; json.contact.email = \"mail@tomnomnom.com\"; json.contact.twitter = \"@TomNomNom\"; json.github = \"https://github.com/tomnomnom/\"; json.likes = []; json.likes[0] = \"code\"; json.likes[1] = \"cheese\"; json.likes[2] = \"meat\"; json.name = \"Tom\"; From a URL: ▶ gron http://headers.jsontest.com/ json = {}; json.Host = \"headers.jsontest.com\"; json[\"User-Agent\"] = \"gron/0.1\"; json[\"X-Cloud-Trace-Context\"] = \"6917a823919477919dbc1523584ba25d/11970839830843610056\"; Or from stdin: ▶ curl -s http://headers.jsontest.com/gron json = {}; json.Accept = \"*/*\"; json.Host = \"headers.jsontest.com\"; json[\"User-Agent\"] = \"curl/7.43.0\"; json[\"X-Cloud-Trace-Context\"] = \"c70f7bf26661c67d0b9f2cde6f295319/13941186890243645147\"; Grep for something and easily see the path to it: ▶ gron testdata/two.jsongrep twitter json.contact.twitter = \"@TomNomNom\"; gron makes diffing JSON easy too: ▶ diffjson.contact.email = \"contact@tomnomnom.com\"; The output of gron is valid JavaScript: ▶ gron testdata/two.json > tmp.js ▶ echo \"console.log(json);\" >> tmp.js ▶ nodejs tmp.js { contact: { email: 'mail@tomnomnom.com', twitter: '@TomNomNom' }, github: 'https://github.com/tomnomnom/', likes: [ 'code', 'cheese', 'meat' ], name: 'Tom' } It's also possible to obtain the gron output as JSON stream via the --json switch: ▶ curl -s http://headers.jsontest.com/gron --json [[],{}] [[\"Accept\"],\"*/*\"] [[\"Host\"],\"headers.jsontest.com\"] [[\"User-Agent\"],\"curl/7.43.0\"] [[\"X-Cloud-Trace-Context\"],\"c70f7bf26661c67d0b9f2cde6f295319/13941186890243645147\"] ungronning gron can also turn its output back into JSON: ▶ gron testdata/two.jsongron -u { \"contact\": { \"email\": \"mail@tomnomnom.com\", \"twitter\": \"@TomNomNom\" }, \"github\": \"https://github.com/tomnomnom/\", \"likes\": [ \"code\", \"cheese\", \"meat\" ], \"name\": \"Tom\" } This means you use can use gron with grep and other tools to modify JSON: ▶ gron testdata/two.jsongrep likesgron --ungron { \"likes\": [ \"code\", \"cheese\", \"meat\" ] } or ▶ gron --json testdata/two.jsongrep likesgron --json --ungron { \"likes\": [ \"code\", \"cheese\", \"meat\" ] } To preserve array keys, arrays are padded with null when values are missing: ▶ gron testdata/two.jsongrep likesgrep -v cheese json.likes = []; json.likes[0] = \"code\"; json.likes[2] = \"meat\"; ▶ gron testdata/two.jsongrep likesgrep -v cheesegron --ungron { \"likes\": [ \"code\", null, \"meat\" ] } If you get creative you can do some pretty neat tricks with gron, and then ungron the output back into JSON.

Yes it was! The original version is preserved here for posterity. Why the change to Go? Mostly to remove PHP as a dependency. There's a lot of people who work with JSON who don't have PHP installed. Why shouldn't I just use jq? jq is awesome, and a lot more powerful than gron, but with that power comes complexity. gron aims to make it easier to use the tools you already know, like grep and sed. gron's primary purpose is to make it easy to find the path to a value in a deeply nested JSON blob when you don't already know the structure; much of jq's power is unlocked only once you know that structure.",

(I may be unusual in that department, in that I actually like awk)One warning to note is that gron burns RAM. I&#x27;ve killed 32GB servers working with 15MB JSON files. (I think gron -u is even worse, but my memory is a bit fuzzy here).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adamritter&#x2F;fastgron as an alternative has been pretty good to me in terms of performance, I think both in speed and RAM usage. reply Alifatisk 3 hours agoparent> One warning to note is that gron burns RAM. I&#x27;ve killed 32GB servers working with 15MB JSON files.That sounds seriously like there is something wrong with the tool reply xiphias2 9 hours agoparentprevThanks for mentioning my project (fastgron).It reads the file into memory once, then just goes through it only once, so it shouldn&#x27;t need much more memory than the file size.Also I put a lot of work into making fastgron -u fast, but you can grep the file directly as well. reply zimpenfish 3 hours agoparentprevI have a version of `gron` which uses almost no RAM to parse files (uses the streaming JSON parser rather than loading the file.) Processed a 4GB JSON file on a Pi using it (admittedly, it took forever) taking, IIRC, about 64MB RAM tops.`gron -u` is basically impossible to optimise unless you know the input is in \"sorted\" order (ie the order it comes out of `gron`, including the `json.a = {};` bits) in which case my code can handle that in almost no RAM also. But if it&#x27;s not sorted or you&#x27;re missing the `json.a = {};` lines, there&#x27;s not a lot you can do since you have to hold the whole data structure in RAM. reply sph 2 hours agorootparent> you have to hold the whole data structure in RAMSure, but something is seriously wrong if a 15 MB JSON data structure uses more than 32 GB of RAM. reply zimpenfish 2 hours agorootparentThat 15MB JSON expands when piped through `gron` - my 7MB pathological test file is 143MB and 2M lines after going through `gron` (which is lines like `json[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][1][1][0][0] = \"x\";`)Which is 20 levels of unknown-sized and unknown-typed slices of slices of `any` in Go and that is not super-efficient, alas. It gets worse when you have maps of slices of maps etc. `fastgron` gets around this by being able to manage its own memory.(`gron` can, however, reconstruct the output correctly if you shuffle the input. `fastgron` cannot. Which suggests to me it&#x27;s maybe using the same &#x27;output as we go&#x27; trick that my `gron` fork uses for its \"input is sorted\" mode which uses almost no RAM but cannot deal with disordered input.)(`gron` could&#x2F;should maybe indicate the maximum size of the slices and if they&#x27;re a single type which would make things more efficient and I might add that to my fork.) reply treyd 11 hours agoparentprevWhat could possibly be so memory-intensive about gron?

Jq does have a little bit of a learning curve necessary to get good use out of it, so I could see this being a nice quick tool for people who don’t want to make that investment.

Conor Barnes Mar 24, 2023 18 Share this post The Placeholder Girlfriend parhelia.conorbarnes.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 6 Share I had the feeling I was a placeholder girlfriend. That once the winter was over she wouldn’t need me anymore. I had this feeling because it hadn’t started like my other relationships. I’d kept seeing her at parties with all the Toronto grad students that autumn and thought she was so different from me. Whatever the opposite of basic is. Advanced? I had the feeling she didn’t even own sweatpants, if that makes sense. She’d see me across the party and would watch me but wouldn’t return my waves. Somehow she found out I had a crush on her and it didn’t change anything. Just the stare, maybe a polite nod, then she’d go back to half-listening to whoever was trying to impress her. She was beautiful like an ice sculpture is beautiful. I knew her thesis was on Italian autonomist feminism of the 1970s. I had no idea what that meant so I never risked talking to her and embarrassing myself. My thesis was on the history of memes. I wanted to change it but didn’t know what else I could talk about. Then one night she called me. The wind of the first real snowstorm whistled through my window and made me cover my other ear while I listened to her talk to me for the first time. She told me she found me really pretty. That she’d always admired me from a distance. And would I come over? We didn’t talk much that night or any night after. But on the subway back to my apartment in North York the next morning, in between games of Candy Crush, I realized we were going out. I had a nagging feeling I couldn’t explain though. Before she’d kissed me she’d told me that she’d been in a long distance relationship and they’d broken up that day. It flattered me that I was who she called but it wasn’t exactly romantic. I only worried I was a placeholder girlfriend in the back of my mind though, like when I woke up or when videos were loading. It became real when I saw the list. When I saw the rubric. She had been at the university and needed files off her computer. I was lazing around in her living room. I had four roommates and she had none. I should have been working on my thesis, but I enjoyed being in an apartment without roommates so much that I was just laying around listening to my Harry Potter podcasts. I didn’t know if she had rent control or was just rich but she did have an office. She was like what I imagined a grad student should be. She had me go into her office and she walked me through transferring the files. But she had left a spreadsheet open. I tried not to look but I think that’s actually impossible. Because I saw my name at the top. And I saw numbers and a whole column of red cells. And then it clicked. If you saw a sheet rating you in bed out of 10, with a hundred other ratings too, you would look. You would peek. “Hey?” she said over the phone. “Did it go through?” “Oh,” I said. I clicked through the remaining buttons. “Yeah. Yeah. There should be an email.” I swallowed dryly. “You should have everything.” “Awesome. Okay, got it. Gotta run, bye!” Then I was left with the sheet. I tried not to keep reading. I tried to tell myself it was private. But it wasn’t. It was about me, so it wasn’t private. And then when I started to read it, started understanding what the numbers meant, I tried to tell myself I’d seen enough, I didn’t need to keep reading. But I did. I couldn’t stop. Humor 2.0 Movie Taste 5.0 Love-making 6.5 I scrolled and scrolled. There were a hundred cells and almost every one was red. Almost every mark was shitty. The only green was: Beauty 8.0 The fact that that was the only one where I passed made the whole thing even worse. Everything cut me. Gift-giving. Punctuality. Memory. The notes beside them only hurt more (“only funny unintentionally”, “un-self-aware Harry Potter nostalgia”, “Pillow princess”). I was mortified but I couldn’t stop reading. It even seemed like there were categories specifically invented to hurt me (Freckles: 2). And there were others with entirely no explanation, just there to haunt (Friends: 4.5). The worst part was that it all seemed true. It became clear as soon as I read it. I wasn’t smart enough (5.0) to create a narrative where I was actually a really good listener, I had just always hidden from myself the fact that I was a bad listener (3.0). My entire personality was getting pulled back like a hangnail. My mind raced through thoughts until it settled on three it repeated over and over and over: Your girlfriend should think of you as a ten in everything. No. You aren’t even supposed to think these things. Why doesn’t she just break up with me? It burned through me until, finally, I reached the bottom. Then I truly broke down, staring at the big, bold, red cell: Status: Temporary If I had any Imagination (another 2.0) I’d say something like: it made me feel like the sun laying down its judgment upon one of the barren and useless planets near it. But all I could really say is: it made me want to die. It made me cry huge gobby tears all over her desk and I should have realized that would happen because I was too Emotional (4.0). It made me wail like a child on the floor of her stupid, parent-paid office. After minutes of this, it made me want revenge. For one horrible second I contemplated killing her but that was wildly out of proportion and then I tried to pretend that I had only wished she was dead and then I just tried to forget about it. My mom says that the best revenge is a life well lived. When I met my dad I asked him about that and he laughed oddly loudly and said once you’re thinking about getting revenge it’s too late to have a good life. Then he took pictures with me and the zoo pandas behind us and I never saw him again. When I tried imagining a good life I couldn’t. I couldn’t imagine going to work thinking about my Work ethic (2.5) or Problem-solving (5.5) or Punctuality (4.0). I couldn’t imagine going to a party ever again with my lack of Fashion (6.0) and Wit (2.0). I’d always imagined that if I was on the run for a crime I’d hide away as a nun, but even that wouldn’t work because I had no Patience (3.0). But then I realized that I hadn’t understood what a good life could be. I hadn’t been thinking about just how good life could be. It’s all just numbers. It’s all just 1 to 10 (besides the 0 I got for math). If I changed, if I got everything to a 10, wouldn’t that mean that her wisdom was low? What I mean is, wouldn’t that show what an idiot she was? Right now if I told anybody about the list they’d think she was a monster. But they’d also know she was right and would reflect on how pathetic I was. But if I revealed the list after becoming a 10 in everything they’d think about how pathetic she was. An idiot and a monster. They’d say to me: who’s that girl you’re with? Is she your placeholder girlfriend? They’d say that to me. I got up off the floor. I went to the computer. I scrolled back to ambition, way at the beginning of her hundred row sheet. Its 2.5 stared at me. I changed it to a 10. The first thing I decided to learn was how to learn. I had to learn a lot of things so I had to do it fast and right. It was the beginning of winter and I wanted to emerge in spring like a cherry blossom or whatever kind of blossoms happen in spring. I wanted her to melt in embarrassment like the snow. The problem was that I knew my mind just didn’t work like that. It liked going slowly. And detours. But I knew it was possible to change how your mind works, like melting an old ring into a pretty one. I went to some of the grad students and bought up the hallucinogens they were researching. Then I put all of them as far back on my tongue as I could, swallowed two big glasses of water, sat in my lightless room with my headphones on, and willed myself to become a good learner. I imagined squeezing my brain like play-doh until I could be like those robots that learn things faster than any human and it makes them powerful beyond belief. Over the next 12 hours my mind split apart. When it reformed, it reformed softer. More ready. More malleable. When I went back to the grad students the next day to swear them in as my practice partners, they joked they were worried about me but I could tell they were intrigued. Internally I changed my Interesting score from 1.0 to 10. Then began the work. If you like, imagine a training montage. I really like the one in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix when they’re all getting good at spells together. I knew I needed my own team but it had to be a secret. I had to take her by surprise. I’d meet my partners in hidden classrooms, prayer rooms, their apartments. The grad students were all so curious and I knew I could use it. I swore each of them individually into secrecy. They all hated working on their theses. They were all bundled up in little apartments around the university waiting for spring like hibernating bears. It was like I could give them one little dream they didn’t understand but would always remember. One guy was my Humor partner. I admitted to him that I didn’t really get jokes. I would just watch for other peoples’ reactions and nobody ever noticed me laughing a little late. He explained that it’s mostly about timing and the unexpected and being animated. “Like this?” I said, a little loudly and suddenly. He laughed, which I thought was good, but he said “No, you need energy. People aren’t entertained by a rock.” So we drilled it. “Ayyyy babe,” I’d say as I walked in to a session, or “Yo!” Then I’d tease him, or myself, or our crazy mayor. I had a running joke with him about the snow (“What if we put all the global warming in Toronto?”). Very soon, he was chortling and sometimes outright laughing. 10. One girl was my Culture partner. I explained that I needed to become “cultured”. She asked what I meant and I admitted I didn’t know. Well, I had just come from a joke session, so what I said was “I was hoping you could tell me!” She laughed. But then she assigned me reading. I had become very good at reading. Before my dark night of the soul I had only been seeing words. After that I saw ideas. I could rotate them and connect them like Lego. Reading the words was now as easy as grabbing a big handful of Lego. I read through poetry and fiction and commentary and letters from this century and many others. The letters were my favourite because the writers didn’t take them as seriously as the books. I was big into not taking things too seriously now. Before it had bothered me that I was low on both Ambition and Chill (6.0). But now I was at 10 for both. I was going to humiliate my evil girlfriend. But I was chill about it because I knew it would happen. My favourite writers were not chill. They were fucked up. I remembered that my girlfriend’s favourite writer was Sylvia Plath so I got really into her husband and the people Plath admired and considered better than her. This didn’t take long at all. When my writing conspirator asked about my thesis on memes, I explained memetic contagion instead, including an aside on Burroughs’s assertion that language is a virus from outer space. When she asked which Beatle was best, I proved that Yoko Ono was superior. She was delighted. “I don’t know what’s going on with you. But would you review my novel when it’s ready?” I said yes, of course. Culture: 10. And a bonus to Selflessness as well. Both of those were hours in the morning. I wasn’t working on my thesis anymore. It could wait until spring. Instead I was doing eight sessions a day. When I solved a trait another one came in. At the bottom of winter, when the sun only peeks out at noon and then retreats, I added Lovemaking. I found a guy I had hooked up with in first year and told him I wanted to make love every weekday at 3PM. I wanted to become the best lover he could ever imagine. Because my thoughtfulness score was going up I asked him: How did that make him feel? Did any reservations come to mind? Would he like to take a few days to think about it? He replied \"Nah I'm down.\" So we began. I will spare you details about our progress. I will say that at first he didn’t understand the feedback phase but he came to appreciate it. I will say that he became a 10 lover as well. Throughout all of this I saw my girlfriend less but not so little she’d dump me. I hid all my new powers besides the lovemaking from her. I knew that that would draw her in because she was shallow. Only shallow people make a sheet. Only shallow people rate their girlfriend’s tenderness out of 10. Or at least that’s how I thought at first. Each time I hit a 10 I’d think about what number she’d have. She didn’t have much Humor either, maybe a 5. She wasn’t that Chill — if you have a home office and desk and two monitors you aren’t Chill. She was only a 10 lover when I was a 10 lover with her. Those were the hardest moments. We’d lay there gasping and I’d always tell her I’d need to clean up. But in the washroom I’d just shake and open the window and let the Toronto winter dive into my lungs and I’d wonder if I was doing the right thing. I was becoming a more thoughtful person and I knew revenge was wrong. I knew I didn’t wish my pain on anybody so why was I making an exception for her? But I had to keep going. I had become a 10 in so many things that I couldn’t stop now. Thoughtfulness could be the last thing. I could even finish it a little after my big reveal. Not yet. Part of my thoughtfulness was realizing that nobody is perfect. But I was getting there. I was closing in, more relentless than the blizzards that year, which came down like snow dumped from buckets. I knew I was still emotional. My partner for that was an econ student. We met in her apartment on St. George Street just north of the university. I’d originally chosen her because I’d assumed an econ student would be more emotionally stable than all the humanities grads I knew. Honestly, I thought she’d be boring. I didn’t know how passionate she was. She showed me pictures of dying animals and the horrible stories of how they’d become separated from their mothers. It made me weep. She explained that people mostly donate to their universities and churches but for a little money you could save a child from a horrible death. It made me rage at people’s ignorance. Finally, I made her tell me a story about a woman named Alice who rated her girlfriend Roberta and rated her badly. I wanted to be so emotionally strong that I could handle the greatest embarrassment of my life. But I couldn’t. It made me leave the session and wander the Annex pretending I was somebody else. For a few days I tried becoming emotionless about these. I tried turning all my emotions off like taps. She realized what was going on. “Look. I can tell you’re still emotional even if you’re trying not to show it”. I was impressed by her wisdom. “You can have emotional responses,” she continued. “It’s healthy. These are horrible things. You just need to not let it ruin you. You need to have a plan for how to deal with it.” The next day, when she showed me a dying bird, a single tear ran down my eye. I said: “We humans should disrupt the natural environment less.” Then she showed me a child dying of malaria. I shook my head and said “Humans should try to be as effective with their charitable giving as they are with their big purchases. We have so much potential to do good in the world.” Then she told me the story of the cruel girlfriend Alice again like I'd asked. She didn’t know it was my story, of course, but she was a good storyteller and some of the details were correct. She had Roberta (me) sobbing and everything. When she finished I was proud. I had lasted through the whole thing. I had cried but not loudly, just little hiccup-y gasps. I looked up at her and said: \"Roberta should get revenge.\" “Revenge?” She looked surprised. “I get something like… I don’t know, but revenge is a leap.” “Why not?” I asked. “Alice hurt her more than should even be possible.” The sky in the apartment windows was blue, a March-bright blue, and the glare made it hard for me to focus on her eyes, which were brighter than anybody’s I’d stared into all winter. “Yeah but like. This says way more about her than about her girlfriend.” “What?” “Alice is crazy. If you make a sheet ranking a hundred attributes of your lover, you’re crazy, right?” “Yeah, so?” “So why would Roberta trust or care what Alice says about her? Why would Alice have a clue about any of this? I don’t think Alice knows the first thing about anything.” I stopped myself from telling her I knew it was all true. I stopped myself from explaining that my girlfriend had known me better than I’d known myself. I was open mouthed and had nothing to say. “Honestly, I feel sad for Alice, she’s so confused,” she continued. “I’d feel even worse for her if Roberta humiliated her. Would it be at a party or something? That would just suck.” I stopped myself from telling her the contents of my revenge. But she was right. I had imagined it culminating in a party. I had imagined becoming the life of the party. In my first year I didn’t know anything about alcohol and when we played beer pong I was drinking pure vodka and I became drunker than anything and I suppose technically I was the life of the party because I got crazy nicknames that night. But this wouldn’t be like that at all. I’d actually be the life of the party. I’d be so interesting that people would tell each other they were going to the washroom but instead they’d come see me. If anybody got too drunk I’d lend them my spare room and appoint two trustworthy watchers. When, I’d return I’d turn it into a dance party complete with the playlist I’d been making for months. I would grab men and women and bring them to dance with me and I’d dance so well they wouldn’t be afraid to dance well too. I would make sure everybody would leave the party feeling not just that they were lucky to be there, but that I felt lucky to have them. Then I would retire with my girlfriend. I would make love to her perfectly. Then, a little while later, I would tell her she was a monster, that I was done with her, and I would call her a cab and I would never see her again. I looked up at my friend now. She was waiting patiently, smiling slightly. She hadn’t judged me when I cried about the bird. She had held my hand when she told me about effective charity. Right now her long black hair was falling into her eyes the way it did when it leaned forward. I did not know if the shape of her body was beautiful under her layers but I knew the way she moved was beautiful. I began to get a curious feeling. Then something horrible came over me. Numbers began floating into my mind. Thoughtfulness: 10. Interestingness: 8.0. Beauty: 8.0. I stood in terror and she looked surprised. “Would you be around tonight?” I asked suddenly. “There’s something I have to finish. To end. Right now.” Of course, she said. She’d be around tonight. Winter was ending early. I ran through the campus and overheated and had to fold more and more layers to carry under my arms. I almost slipped on the melting and glistening sidewalks but I made it to my girlfriend’s house out of breath and red in the face. It was not how I had imagined it. Her eyebrows rose and she looked me up and down as I panted on her porch. “I need you to be honest,” I said. A screen separated us and I knew the same way I was constructing her image separated by the little squares of mesh, she was constructing her judgment of me out of all her tiny stupid spreadsheet cells. Before she could reply, I said it: “I’m just your placeholder girlfriend.” Her lips pursed and she couldn’t look at me anymore. I hadn’t asked her a question. She looked at the sidewalk and at the porch. She looked anywhere else. Then she slowly came back to me. “I guess so. I guess you were.” I couldn't reply. I registered that she hadn’t apologized. “You found my sheet, didn’t you? I saw the ambition edit.” Then I remembered way back at the beginning when I’d changed the Ambition rating to 10. It had been a mistake, one I wouldn’t make now. I nodded. She shrugged. “I like being real with myself about where I’m at. So I do those sheets. I’m sorry you saw it. But I can tell you’ve been working on things. I’ve admired it. The sex is great. I don’t think you’re a placeholder anymore.” I felt several paths in front of me. I almost told her I needed a better apology. I almost told her I had hidden how much I had changed, I was basically a 10 in everything now. I almost told her she had hurt me more than she ever could have imagined. This is what I did instead: I told her I was sorry she needed that. Then I kissed her cheek like the moon kisses the sun at the end of an eclipse. Then I left. Then I was gone. It was not sweet. It was not the crowning achievement of my winter. It was just done. That night I got coffee with my new friend. When her hair fell in front of her eyes, I moved it back. When she asked if everything was okay and I told her it was good now, I could feel the warmth of her happiness radiate across the table. When the date ended, I asked to see her again the next day. We could go to the ceramics museum down the street and I’d buy her blue china from the gift store where the old ladies slowly wrap and tie in layers and layers of bubble wrap. We could walk through the Annex and pick whichever restaurant was newest. We could go through High Park, through the zoo and meet the reindeer, who make me think of Christmas, and the peacocks, who make me think of the sun. We decided to do it all. We were happy. I never thought about revenge again. Thanks for reading Parhelia! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

Excellent storytelling, thanks for bringing us along on your journey.My favorite line: \"Before it had bothered me that I was low on both Ambition and Chill (6.0). But now I was at 10 for both. I was going to humiliate my evil girlfriend. But I was chill about it because I knew it would happen.\" reply gurchik 8 hours agoparentCan you say more about why you liked the ending, to someone who doesn&#x27;t get it? It doesn&#x27;t seem like a happy ending to me. She&#x27;s riding off into the sunset, happy that she became the better person and didn&#x27;t humiliate her girlfriend. But she doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that the actions she _did_ take throughout the story arguably made her the \"evil girlfriend\" the entire time, and there isn&#x27;t any indication that has changed by the end of the story. reply spencerchubb 7 hours agorootparentWhat did the author do that was evil? I don&#x27;t see anything in the story that makes the author evil. She improved herself and after she graduated from placeholder status, she turns the tables.When she had sex with someone else, I don&#x27;t really think it was cheating since their relationship was labeled \"Temporary\" reply gurchik 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just the sex with someone else. The main character is lying to their girlfriend the entire time, avoiding the girlfriend to prepare in secret, trying to \"get\" her before she herself gets \"got.\" But she didn&#x27;t even know for sure the \"got\" was going to come. Yes, she saw the \"temporary\" label, but every relationship starts out temporary. Sometimes people date other people knowing ahead of time that it won&#x27;t last forever. Sometimes people express that fact in writing (private diary, spreadsheet, whatever). That doesn&#x27;t excuse this behavior. I&#x27;m curious, if cheating in this kind of relationship is fine, when do you think it becomes unacceptable? reply lmm 6 hours agorootparent> But she didn&#x27;t even know for sure the \"got\" was going to come.

Sometimes people express that fact in writing (private diary, spreadsheet, whatever). That doesn&#x27;t excuse this behavior.I&#x27;m not completely convinced. I don&#x27;t agree with \"every relationship starts out temporary\"; to me a relationship should be part of a good-faith effort towards a permanent relationship unless agreed otherwise. (And if you take the position that the girlfriend didn&#x27;t agree to a relationship at all, then by the same token she can&#x27;t complain about it being nonexclusive). If you know someone&#x27;s maintaining a relationship with you under deeply false pretenses (explicitly or implicitly), then I don&#x27;t think you owe them or your relationship any loyalty. reply acjohnson55 7 hours agorootparentprevNot the person you&#x27;re replying to, but yes, I think that&#x27;s right. But that&#x27;s what&#x27;s clever about the story. reply stavros 8 hours agoparentprevI loved that part, such wry humor. reply acjohnson55 7 hours agoprevThis is a great story. I think folks are misreading it as something to be taken literally or that we&#x27;re supposed the condone the narrator&#x27;s reaction.I will say that I relate, because I once overreacted to a breakup going on a massive self-improvement binge. I have mixed feelings about that. On one hand, I don&#x27;t think it came from a place of sound mental health and self-esteem. On the other, a lot of good did come out of it, and I eventually found intrinsic motivation, rather than evaluating myself by how I thought my ex would think about me. reply freetime2 10 hours agoprev> Your girlfriend should think of you as a ten in everything.This seems like a pretty damaging belief to have about relationships. Better to have a significant other who is accepting of your imperfections. reply frereubu 10 hours agoparentThe whole point of this story is that the rating system is silly. The point above is immediately followed by \"No. You aren’t even supposed to think these things.\" It&#x27;s someone&#x27;s confused thoughts in the middle of finding out their partner is rating them out of ten on everything, not an approval of that specific thought. reply yieldcrv 9 hours agorootparentIf anything that list was the best thing that could happen to her, or at least the most introspective. reply flkenosad 9 hours agorootparentBrother, the story is made up! Real people don&#x27;t behave this way. reply freetime2 9 hours agorootparentMaybe not this way exactly, but I have known people who have dramatically improved themselves after experiencing rejection. reply yieldcrv 7 hours agorootparentprevyou mean listing attributes about an undergrad, turning them into your assistant and leaving your computer open with your actively managed character stats sheet for them to find and spiral about, while pretending not to know?or do you mean the undergrad spiraling? reply lazyasciiart 7 hours agorootparentI thought the narrator was also a grad student. replyzlg_codes 8 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s the rating part that is problematic. There&#x27;s understanding your partners strengths and weaknesses, and straight up comparing them to other people. reply freetime2 5 hours agorootparentI expect that my spouse of many years still compares me with other people. Humans are social creatures and are frequently comparing ourselves and our families to others. While too much can certainly be a recipe for unhappiness, I think that’s one of the primary ways that we learn and grow.A spreadsheet may feel very shallow and icky, but we also are not privy to the girlfriend’s thoughts and motives in this story. It could just be a tool to help her process her feelings. We don’t know how much weight she assigns to a 2 in Wit. And most relationships start off as “temporary” status.My spouse has kept a journal off and on over the years. While it may be a shock initially to read something unflattering about myself in there, it also wouldn’t be a deal breaker for me. And not that far removed from a spreadsheet in my opinion. reply xerox13ster 10 hours agoparentprevI think you misunderstand the intent of that statement then. That statement is a way to say your significant other should curve the scale so you&#x27;re their 10, if they accept you as you are. reply gnulinux 10 hours agorootparentI think this is also unrealistic and potentially damaging to the relationship. I have some really bad behavior, I try to be better every day, but yeah I&#x27;m bad in some ways. My girlfriend knows this and she accepts but it&#x27;d be a lie to say my bad behavior doesn&#x27;t bother her. And same for vice versa. No one is perfect, especially if you live with them every day in the same house. reply freetime2 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s more or less how I understood it, and I don&#x27;t think it is a healthy thing to require of your partner. For one I don&#x27;t think it is possible for someone to just override their feelings like that.And anyway I want my partner to understand my strengths and weaknesses. And to help me improve myself where possible with encouragement and constructive criticism, or to offset my weaknesses with their strengths. And vice versa. reply lazyasciiart 7 hours agorootparentprevThat’s silly. My partner is a better cook than I am and a better driver. Any scale where I rate a 10 for either of those is dangerously disconnected from reality. reply 1letterunixname 9 hours agoparentprevMeasuring people against one another or comparing oneself to others is a large source of human suffering.\"Accepting imperfections\": depends on what it is and if it&#x27;s an intrinsic attribute or a habit. A good partner helps the other become better where possible. reply electrondood 8 hours agoparentprevDid you read past the first 15%? reply freetime2 5 hours agorootparentI did. If my comment makes you think that I missed something important in the story, I would appreciate it if you could elaborate further. reply throwbadubadu 9 hours agoprevOnly one here finding that story super awkward, weird and full of clichēs? reply layer8 9 hours agoparentThe issue for me is that neither the detailed-spreadsheet girlfriend nor the levelling-up-all-the-skills girlfriend seem particularly believable characters. And the “I’m fake-sorry you’re such a pitiful person” is always cringy. Not to mention that “Roberta” almost did the same to “Alice” in return by pettily now also keeping her as a temporary girlfriend. Leaving her right away would have been the more appropriate and “levelled-up” choice. reply gurchik 8 hours agorootparentThe main character cheated on their girlfriend to prepare for revenge for... what crime exactly? A private note that she violated her girlfriend&#x27;s privacy to read? Are we supposed to root for the main character because they stopped themselves short on getting revenge and wasn&#x27;t as shitty of a person as they originally wanted to be? I get this is (likely) fiction, and with all art, not everyone is going to \"get it.\" That said, I don&#x27;t really get it. The main character is the worst person in the story, but they&#x27;re also not a relatable flawed antihero you can root for. What did the author intend for us to think? reply layer8 8 hours agorootparentYeah, the juxtaposition of those flaws with the “let me work hard to become a more admirable (admired?) person” with the “and I’m super skillful at those improvements” is weird.Also details like cannot help but weep at the picture of a dead bird. reply LeroyRaz 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree. Spreadsheet person is bizarre, but did nothing wrong (nor are they sad for having a spreadsheet, just unusual).I also find the protagonists leveling up mockable (but not particularly funny). Personal growth in any characteristic takes time and major effort, but maybe that is part of the satire?I find it hard to workout what is being played straight, and what is being mocked, tbh, I just don&#x27;t care, or find it that funny.The tropes seem strongly tied to the rationality and EA communities, so maybe if one is part of those communities there is more to the satire? reply acjohnson55 7 hours agorootparentprevI believe we&#x27;re supposed to empathize with the hurt the narrator feels but see that the narrator is a bit deranged. The in-story new girlfriend even sees this, and probably knows that the Alice and Roberta story is really about the narrator. It&#x27;s basically an anti-hero story. reply smsm42 7 hours agorootparentprevI can believe in the spreadsheet Alice. I mean I&#x27;ve met people that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I learned they did it. Males, but I don&#x27;t see why a female can&#x27;t be that too. reply DontchaKnowit 5 hours agoparentprevNo I was pretty repulsed by it. Goofy and unbelievable premise dressed up to sound profound. Also the prose was kinda whack.Not my cup of tea. reply smsm42 7 hours agoparentprevNo you&#x27;re not probably. But it&#x27;s pretty standard \"A is wronged undeservedly, then A becomes super cool and shows everybody and especially the wronger how it was wrong and then lives happily ever after\". There&#x27;s literally thousands of movies with this formula. Nothing wrong with it, it&#x27;s a nice story formula. I personally like the ones where there&#x27;s mafia and retired special ops guy and loud explosions more, but I wouldn&#x27;t judge anybody who likes this way more. The only mistake would be to seek there something that isn&#x27;t there. reply woleium 9 hours agoparentprevit’s definitely got first draft vibes, but there is a great story in there. reply op00to 8 hours agoparentprevIt read like a bullied teenager’s fantasy scribblings. reply stavros 8 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know, I found it a very enjoyable piece of satire. reply cwmma 10 hours agoprevI liked this, but you could tell a guy wrote it, the tip off was when the women (briefly) contemplates killing her girlfriend for for embarrassing her. reply stavros 8 hours agoparentThis comment bothers me, because here I was, reading this story, not generalizing about what gender does what, just seeing a character with flaws, and then your comment comes along and makes it not just about the gender of the character, but the gender of the author as well. Your comment alleges that it&#x27;s obvious that a man wrote this character (this sounds sexist to me), because only a man can write a bad female character (this also sounds sexist to me), and the character is bad because no woman thinks like this (I don&#x27;t know what generalizing something over three and a half billion people sounds to me).I read the story as the protagonist being vulnerable, insecure, and a bit unhinged:> For one horrible second I contemplated killing her but that was wildly out of proportion and then I tried to pretend that I had only wished she was dead and then I just tried to forget about it.The other (female, no less) characters in the story seem to agree:> “Revenge?” She looked surprised. “I get something like… I don’t know, but revenge is a leap.”Whereas you explained those same character traits by the author being a man, and thus sexist, and not knowing how women think. That line of thinking already contains two invalid generalizations, ie \"this isn&#x27;t how women think\" and \"therefore a man wrote this, because only men don&#x27;t know how women think\".I guess this bothers me because it takes something I read as just about people being people and turns it into a gender&#x2F;sexism issue, but the mere existence of the complaint itself reveals so much fractal sexism in the eye of the beholder that I wish I could go back and unread it, then I wouldn&#x27;t have spent ten minutes writing this inelegant rebuttal. reply striking 7 hours agorootparentConsider: what is the purpose of each story beat? Why does the girlfriend create the spreadsheet? Why does the main character react so extremely to it? Why does she feel the need to get revenge instead of just moving on? If your answer to each is just \"because otherwise there would be no story\" it does not make for a compelling, realistic story.Sure, there are women who keep spreadsheets like this, and sure, there are women who have outsized reactions. But none of the surrounding context feels reasonable or meaningful. It misses the reason why people keep spreadsheets like this (more to get a better understanding of themselves than to linearly rank their partners) and why someone might react so extremely or try and get revenge (they had already been through some atypical situation that made them this way or otherwise, for example; nearly any explanation would do but we&#x27;re not given one).It&#x27;s not just that the author is male. It&#x27;s that the author is male and is making contrivances that don&#x27;t feel realistic, that could feel more realistic after some sort of consultation with either a more experienced writer or just like a woman or whatever. The characters are just cardboard cutouts that move a story forward and that doesn&#x27;t make for a good read.And is it really sexist to point out (especially in combination with the above) that the author is a man when the whole story is intended to be a relationship between two women, a kind of experience that the author is unlikely to have personally had? reply ofcourseyoudo 1 hour agorootparentBut you&#x27;re a man, and so is the original commenter, so we can freely disregard your POV as well. reply stavros 7 hours agorootparentprev> Consider: what is the purpose of each story beat?

If your answer to each is just \"because otherwise there would be no story\" it does not make for a compelling, realistic story.I took the story as satire, with the over-the-top reactions of both the spreadsheet-maker and the spreadsheet-reader. I don&#x27;t know why the spreadsheet-maker made the spreadsheet, but I also don&#x27;t know why Romeo and Juliet fell in love, beyond \"otherwise there would be no story\". Your points are reasonable, it&#x27;s just that I enjoyed the story as satire even with these elements.> And is it really sexist to point out (especially in combination with the above) that the author is a man when the whole story is intended to be a relationship between two women, a kind of experience that the author is unlikely to have personally had?I&#x27;ll reuse the same example, do we need Shakespeare to have attempted suicide with his 13-year-old lover before he could write the play? reply striking 6 hours agorootparentYou can take the story for whatever genre you see it as, but being satire doesn&#x27;t excuse it from being shallow.Romeo and Juliet fall in love for some very grounded, realistic reasons. They are adolescents, which are known to be particularly susceptible to falling in love, and also doing it with someone your parents don&#x27;t like is extra hot, and so on.And the way the story plays out requires some suspension of disbelief (wait, how did they get married if the royals would forbid it?) but it is always explained in a way that at least feels like it logically follows (oh, the Friar believes secretly marrying the two might bring peace; funnily ironic that they then should die instead).Shakespeare did not have to experience these situations in order to portray them. When they start to get over the top and imaginative we at least feel like we started from some sort of grounded position, so it isn&#x27;t so hard to suspend our disbelief. The entire play is building up to this ultimate tragedy and it earns it.This contrasts with the other work, which does not set up anything before attempting to claim a payoff. The characters just are the way they are, things just happen. They don&#x27;t have to be explained or have reasons that follow, because it&#x27;s just satire.I am not blaming the author for taking creative license in the way that Shakespeare did in describing the suicide of a pair of romantically involved individuals. Nor am I blaming the author for being a man. I am blaming the author for producing a work that is just shallow in a gendered feeling way. Were the author a woman, they might have realized that women don&#x27;t just do things randomly but instead, drawing on her past experience being a woman, that they usually have a backstory where these things originate from.If you like stories like this, don&#x27;t let me yuck your yum.

Even fleetingly? reply striking 9 hours agorootparentIn response to being listed in a spreadsheet? It&#x27;s not a great thing to experience but women are pretty much constantly objectified in our society so it does seem a little out of left field that this particular incident sets our main character (briefly) on the path to murder. A male author might find this premise to be novel simply for not having had the same life experiences as a female author might have had (i.e. not being regularly objectified).I too found this work to feel a little weird, for the same reason as GP. It feels like a story told the way a man might experience it, but with a woman&#x27;s voice and tone. Less believable still is the way it goes on and on, with the protagonist trying to turn herself into a perfectly scoring example. I get that sometimes it&#x27;s okay because otherwise there would be no story, but I don&#x27;t buy the motivation or the end result in combination and that really makes it hard for me to read.I&#x27;ve actually heard of this particular thing (spreadsheets of dating partners) already and the way it was presented to me it seemed pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s hard to know what you value in a person, so for your own benefit you might try listing a few scores and see which ones match up most strongly with how you feel about someone. Maybe you care deeply that someone knows how to cook, or maybe you think their music taste matching yours is of the utmost importance. It&#x27;s kind of hard to figure out otherwise. I don&#x27;t really feel it&#x27;s quite like an attempt at a linear ordering &#x2F; sorting of people as much as it is for one&#x27;s own benefit.All in all, I kind of wish the author had spent more time consulting women on how their relationships actually work, even if it means the story might never have been written. reply jojobas 8 hours agorootparent>In response to being listed in a spreadsheet?Women sometimes viciously attack each other over petty things like wearing the same dress.Just because women in your circle have restraint doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have urges. reply striking 8 hours agorootparentEven if you accept that premise, why did this character snap at this moment? Usually people who engage in that sort of behavior do so as part of a pattern, sometimes as part of dealing with something that happened to them and other times because it is part of their personality.Meanwhile this character, with whom we are intended by the author to empathize with and who otherwise is portrayed as a normal (though exceedingly neurotic) human being, briefly has the urge to murder.It just kind of feels like it doesn&#x27;t follow, is all. Anyone can have urges but I&#x27;m not quite buying this character having that urge without a little more explanation.(and to be clear: I reject this premise, because without the work making it clear that this specific woman feels this specific way, it feels like the work suggests that we should just accept that any woman might feel this way without serious provocation or a serious backstory and I don&#x27;t) reply flkenosad 9 hours agorootparentprevNot unless their hormones are way off. reply bruce343434 9 hours agorootparentAnd where did you get this idea from? replyReactiveJelly 10 hours agoparentprevok that explains why the author is \"Conor\".

And even good listeners often fail to change even egregious interpersonal faults that affect them negatively. Very little of our society helps us become emotionally smarter - the most skilled I know seemed to learn everything almost in passing - perhaps some sort of emotional genius. We see glimpses of something similar on HN when a poor comment generates an honest critique yet the commenter keeps repeating the same fault (never learns). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;p95-skill&#x2F; seems relevant. Few people ever ask for criticism. Few people give honest criticism.It always surprises me that we can sometimes recognize someone&#x27;s personality within 5 minutes of meeting them. We see faults they perhaps can&#x27;t see or maybe choose to live with (even faults that harm themselves or those near them). And I know a few superskilled that can immediately recognise well-hidden dangers of others.I&#x27;m a middle aged analytical guy.

Some of the people I most admire have low-status jobs and little formal education.I know people that try to make a list of all the attributes they require in a partner. I multiplied out the percentages for one friend, and their chances of finding someone that met all the easy requirements lead to a 1 in 10 billion chance of their perfect partner existing.

They meet people in their own area, of their own age, etc…Especially important is that people tend to meet partners at school or work, which very strongly selects for like-minded people.Hence they don’t need to meet thousands or millions of potential partners: they’re meeting a good subset that is likely to be in that ideal group.I mean, sure, if you had completely arbitrary and unrelated requirements and you were on a series of random blind dates selected via lottery from the global population, then things would look bleak. For most normal people wanting normal things, dating feels oddly lucky. reply robocat 9 hours agorootparent> many attributes are positively correlated.Most definitely. A relevant example here was income and good teeth.Controlling for correlations is well beyond a back-of-the-envelope calculation.

The only self improvement is one in which you feel you have grown more in line with your true self: the you who you want to be. The story is about growing into some dimensions, but if the author does not value those metrics, who is to say it’s positive growth?I have a friend. He’s obsessed with self improvement. And he is good at it. He reads exhaustively about the most effective business people because he says it’s necessary to learn their habits. He gets up at 5:00am every day because sleeping in is wasting time you could spend improving yourself. His weekends are full of planning exercises for how he can most effectively use his week ahead.He makes good money, is in great shape, has great social connections, etc. but he is deeply unhappy. Because to feel the constant need to improve means you also feel a constant sense of not being good enough.I think in the context of this story, and really life in general, the only person whose acceptance matters is your own. To be happy with your life, with how you think and how you spend your time, with who you are and who you keep company with. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agoparentprevYeah. also:GF: She shrugged. “I like being real with myself about where I’m at.

Then I was gone.Me: Sucks being the girlfriend with ADHD and&#x2F;or on the spectrum.What&#x27;s the moral here? All I can see is, \"never ever let others learn of your coping mechanisms - they won&#x27;t understand\". reply tonyarkles 10 hours agorootparent> never ever let others learn of your coping mechanisms - they won&#x27;t understandMy honed-over-16-years org-mode config ensures that this would be unlikely, and someone who does figure out how to navigate my notes and journal entries probably wouldn’t judge too hard :)Less glib, that is a really difficult topic to navigate. Post-diagnosis (at age 36) I tried to be pretty open with the people I love and care about and discovered that many of them were carrying around their own diagnoses in secret. Others didn’t know how to react. No one reacted particularly poorly.I am blessed with a partner who is almost certainly somewhere on the neurodiverse spectrum in some way (never officially diagnosed) and both her and my families are chock full of various ADHD and Autism diagnoses. In a lot of ways I’m almost certain that that’s why our relationship worked out when past relationships hadn’t; things that I thought were perfectly normal behaviour were often deal-breakers to past partners. reply acjohnson55 5 hours agorootparentprevI like the discussion below, because this is honestly a complex issue. It sucks for the narrator if her girlfriend thinks she&#x27;s below her standard. It sucks that she found out accidentally.But is it wrong for the girlfriend to have had those feeling? I don&#x27;t think so. We don&#x27;t get to know, as readers, whether their relationship was supposed to have been serious. So maybe the girlfriend was leading the narrator on, or maybe it was just casual.I also don&#x27;t think it was wrong for the girlfriend to keep an unfiltered journal, if the purpose of the sheet was just working through her thoughts.On the other hand, the narrator encounters the document accidentally. She probably should have respected the girlfriend&#x27;s privacy, but who among us wouldn&#x27;t have read further? It&#x27;s not wrong for her to feel devastated.The basic set up of the story is a conflict between two people, who both have taken understandable actions up to that point. It feels uncomfortable to us, because we want to be able to identify the good guy and bad guy here, but it&#x27;s not so easy. This desire is deeply rooted in Western culture, or maybe even in our neurology as a species.I think it&#x27;s better to assume that most people mean well, but sometimes make suboptimal decisions based on their circumstances and the path dependent development of their personality. Sometimes those decisions can be quite heinous. But for most of us, it&#x27;s the little ways we unintentionally undermine ourselves and our relationships.To me, this story is about this exact thing. The narrator goes a bit off the rails as a result of an understandable emotional trigger. Until the end, the narrator barely, if ever, questions her self-righteousness.It would kind of be cool for the author to write the story from the girlfriend&#x27;s point of view. But then again, he kind of did. The narrator essentially accepts the worldview of the girlfriend, and reorganizes her life around it. But where did the girlfriend&#x27;s worldview come from? Maybe we&#x27;re meant to assume the girlfriend had a similar experience, which drove her to be so top tier, at least superficially. reply strken 9 hours agorootparentprevDoes having ADHD and&#x2F;or being on the spectrum mean that, if your girlfriend discovers you think of the shared relationship as temporary, she shouldn&#x27;t leave?Perhaps the moral of the story is \"other people exist and have agency\". Sure, you&#x27;ve got coping mechanisms, but if they&#x27;re emotionally destructive to other people then you might need better coping mechanisms that aren&#x27;t awful. Maybe you could use the spreadsheet for potential birthday presents and favourite foods instead of deciding to string your partner along but eventually leave.Or perhaps it&#x27;s \"you&#x27;re not always the centre of the story\". Sometimes the story is about the other person being a complete weirdo. Your chill, or lack thereof, is less important than finding out your partner wants to leave you.Or perhaps it&#x27;s \"self-improvement gets you out of bad situations\". Through the process of getting to 10, the protagonist met her future girlfriend and learned to leave her current emotionally hurtful one in a kinder way. reply flkenosad 10 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s no moral.

Does it matter if you do or don&#x27;t materialise what is already in your thoughts into (what should be) a private sheet? reply strken 9 hours agorootparentMy problem with the spreadsheet is that it has \"temporary\" and red cells in it. If your private thoughts are that you should leave your girlfriend, then it&#x27;s a bad idea to stay and a worse idea to compare her to the other options. It&#x27;s inconsiderate of the limited time she has available for living her life. Commit, leave, or communicate to her that the relationship is temporary.Plus, a numerical rating from 0 to 10 is a reductionist way of understanding someone. What exactly does a low chill mean? It&#x27;s probably situational, right? Numerically defining someone turns amorphous changing thoughts into a solid number and locks that perception in place, preventing you from learning more. Maybe you&#x27;re putting her in situations where she&#x27;s not chill? Maybe it&#x27;s situational and you haven&#x27;t learned what causes it?

It&#x27;s pretty rare for mid-level candidates (L4), and expected for senior and up (L5+).Also, there are situations where candidates may have an extra interview added to their slate. One common reason for this: the hiring committee doesn&#x27;t have enough signal because the interviewers don&#x27;t coordinate appropriately, and end up asking heavily overlapping questions (e.g. 3 questions that basically reduce to \"use DFS\"). reply DanAtC 16 hours agoparentNice, make your problem the interviewee&#x27;s problem and waste more of everyone&#x27;s time. reply mnd999 15 hours agorootparentThe arrogance of these companies makes me never want to work there. I did go through the Apple process once though and it was pretty much as described. reply yieldcrv 10 hours agorootparentPeople that need jobs really shouldn&#x27;t view this kind of approach as advice or relevant to them. I feel like that&#x27;s often left out of these kind of takes.For anybody that needs reminding:Companies&#x27; abrasive or uncoordinated interview processes likely has nothing to do with your experience in your team on the company.Your manager&#x27;s uncollaborative behavior may have nothing to do with your day to day, or mental health on the job.Ignoring or leaving any of these companies because you considered any one behavior a red flag is a privileged take for people that have trust funds, masquarading their version of life as normal. reply mnd999 1 hour agorootparentIf you really need a job why would go go through these processes? They’re long and complicated and it’s basically a crapshoot anyway because they do it so badly. Even if you get it you’ll have no negotiating power so you’ll get screwed on comp.Take a contract position or something else less hard to get, get more financially secure and then go for the faang role. reply jrockway 13 hours agorootparentprevGoogle gets away with this because they pay so well. An hour of extra interviewing gets you an extra $400,000 a year. Show up to a 1 hour zoom meeting instead of having a long lunch, then put the money in your savings account (or in the stock market when savings accounts stop being so good) and retire at 35.I left Google for a startup and got basically half the total compensation. 6 years after leaving, I am making about what I did at Google 5 years ago and 2 \"levels\" lower. If I stayed at Google, I&#x27;d be making about $800,000 a year.You should really really ignore the distasteful feeling about being grilled by a bunch of strangers and just do it. (I actually really enjoyed my Google interviews. Problems I hadn&#x27;t seen before that I came up with interesting solutions to.) reply ipaddr 12 hours agorootparentBut you left? reply jrockway 9 hours agorootparentMy project got canceled, so I went somewhere else doing a similar project. Everyone phrases it like they avoid FAANG because of the interviews, and not what they&#x27;ll be working on. If you don&#x27;t like your project, fine, leave the money on the table. If you do like the project but are mad that they ask algorithms questions, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good enough reason to give up millions of dollars over the period of your career. reply superchink 15 hours agorootparentprevideally things go perfectly all the time, but people sometimes make mistakes. what would you rather they do? pass on the candidate because they didn’t get enough data to support a hire? or give them more chances to demonstrate their capabilities? reply brandall10 13 hours agorootparentThey should do the right thing and if the candidate hit the bar on what was asked, however repetitive, they should get the offer.As to \"not enough data\"... how exactly? If there is a list of things to check off that is to be distributed amongst the interviewing team, there should never be an issue. If people are winging it and just happen to ask repetitive questions then everyone asked what they needed to know and signal should be there.It sounds like Google&#x27;s process is fundamentally buggy. They should fix that. reply vitus 7 hours agorootparentThe problem is that a bad hire is really expensive to correct, and so traditionally Google&#x27;s hiring process has erred on the side of being overly conservative. We&#x27;ve rejected some excellent engineers (or driven them away with the process overhead &#x2F; delays) to instead pick up people who grinded leetcode for weeks on end or got lucky with an easy interview slate.Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to quantify exactly what&#x27;s broken about the interview process in a way that justifies (to the appropriate individuals!) upending the status quo. You and I can both complain about how this is terrible for candidate experience and for hiring the best talent, but that&#x27;s not going to change anything. reply hexis 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the candidate should pass on the company. It&#x27;s always good to provide a cost for their mistake. There is no job worth getting jerked around before they even start paying you. reply Eumenes 15 hours agorootparentprevNow you know, and you don&#x27;t have to ever apply&#x2F;interview there! reply eieio 16 hours agoparentprev> One common reason for this: the hiring committee doesn&#x27;t have enough signal because the interviewers don&#x27;t coordinate appropriately, and end up asking heavily overlapping questions (e.g. 3 questions that basically reduce to \"use DFS\").I&#x27;m curious - how much up-front coordination is mandated? Plenty of the interview loops I&#x27;ve done agree in advance to the exact set of questions we&#x27;ll ask during an onsite specifically to avoid problems like this (which of course causes other problems...) reply vitus 7 hours agorootparentWhen interviews were actually in person, there would be a pass-along sheet where you would write down your question. Of course, that wasn&#x27;t perfect (the comment I had about too many people asking BFS was from a pre-pandemic email thread).These days, the actual process is confusing at best (and wildly inconsistent across interviewers, as it&#x27;s dependent on what the recruiter sets up), so it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that it&#x27;s rarely used if ever.To be clear: I don&#x27;t actually know what the rate is of candidates being asked to come back for an extra interview. My understanding is that it&#x27;s always been a last-resort option, but it&#x27;d be one of the more common reasons if the candidate actually made it to the slate of \"in-person\" interviews, and then needed to come back for another one. reply lesuorac 13 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m curious - how much up-front coordination is mandated?None is mandated.It&#x27;s incredibly rare (maybe 5%) to also be requested to put your question into a spreadsheet (that all the interviewers can see) to avoid any overlap pre-interview. Post-interview you have to submit what question you asked into the official (not a spreadsheet) tool. reply idank 14 hours agorootparentprevNot very much. There&#x27;s an interview lead that is supposed to make sure no question overlaps happen. They will sometimes comment on the chosen question (e.g. asking an unrelated question to someone interviewing for a research position). In general I think this is pretty rare as it requires folks to care about their interview before it starts. :) reply teaearlgraycold 16 hours agoparentprevThe Google interview has degraded in the last few years. When I interviewed 6 years ago as a fresh grad they flew me out to Seattle. Now I don’t believe you can go in person even if you want to on your own dime - at least not for the level I interviewed at when I got in a couple years ago (this was after Google’s supposed return-to-office). reply mattnewton 16 hours agorootparentDoes a couple years ago = early 2021 during the pandemic? reply lesuorac 13 hours agorootparentKinda of; that&#x27;s why it changed but it never changed back.I&#x27;m kind of surprised that its impossible to do it locally at all. I know one time I was interviewing at FaceBook and I asked to do the phone screen in-person and they let me (I lived near the office). reply meowtimemania 10 hours agorootparentprevI prefer online. In person means using a whiteboard while online means using a laptop+ text editor. reply tkiolp4 15 hours agoprevHorrible. I’ve been doing software engineering for 12+ years and I’ve never had to pass leetcode questions. I have worked for 5 companies in total, and I think I have been in around 15-20 tech interviews in total as well. The interviews I passed didn’t ask me leetcode questions (I had to do take home assignments and system design). In my last interview they finally stop asking coding questions (staff position). No Faang companies, but tier 2 I’d say. Western Europe. reply tkiolp4 15 hours agoparentTo expand.I guess it depends on the company, as well. I have no idea what engineers at faang do. I can tell you what I have been doing the last decade:- decide what kind of db we should use for our next product. Usually a relational one is good enough, although sometimes document or graph ones are needed- DDD. Or at least I try. Our engineers are able to understand the business and relate terms of the problem domain with ones in the solution domain- identify race conditions. Phantom reads? Those suck, but I keep them out of my codebases- maintenance of public APIs. From authN, to authZ, and keeping backwards compatibility as much as possible- observability, monitoring, slas, slos, slis- debugging distributed systems and distributed monoliths- splitting monoliths into microservices because “why not”, and later regret and start with monoliths again for fresh products- decoupling services by using tools like kafka and debezium- mentoring and couching- helping PMs, POs and business people to build products on time- a large etcYou know what I have never done? Invert a binary tree. I have read the Cormen book; it’s just that if the company I’m going to work on is all about the things I have mentioned above, then asking leetcode questions is a red flag. reply angarg12 14 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m interviewing for Staff level positions and this came in the email of one of the recruiters> For the technical interview, visit leetcode.com and do practice questions at a medium&#x2F;hard difficulty in Algorithm, Data Structures, and Object-Oriented categories to help prepare.I guess for some of us there is no escaping leetcode. reply devwastaken 7 hours agoparentprevLeetcode didn&#x27;t exist before \"anti discrimination\" laws. It was created specifically to give corps a legal barrier to defend against suit because the Fed wrote the law in such a way that you can easily and successfully sue any company for discrimination during the hiring process. So they filter out as hard as they can in a \"neutral\" way.You can see the effect in realtime. Google products are worse than they were 10 years ago when they have good devs that cared. They left and now it&#x27;s just gears in a machine someone else made. reply frozenport 12 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re probably making 3x less reply itronitron 12 hours agorootparentand yet their quality of life is likely 5X higher reply satvikpendem 11 hours agorootparentThat is unknown, as people at FAANG in the US have a comparable quality of life as those in Western Europe, because the things people tout as European advantages like free healthcare and long paid vacations, FAANG workers in the US essentially already have. They are getting paid much more for a similar standard of living, which in turn decreases their retirement age, if they so choose. reply Der_Einzige 11 hours agorootparentprevUltra mega cope. Many FAANG engineers are testing and vesting, doing almost no work while taking that money in reply spongebobstoes 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m glad that you have had this experience! However, passing leetcode questions will typically open up new job opportunities and increase total compensation.Anecdotally, I actually find it a good filtering signal for top talent. That is, all the best engineers I&#x27;ve worked with have always been able to crush leetcode interview questions, even if they find the questions annoying.I think it is probably only a good filter if truly trying to hire the top 1% of engineers. Almost nobody is though, as is evident from their undifferentiated pay scale. reply neilv 15 hours agorootparentLeetcode interviews are for people who studied and practiced for Leetcode interviews specifically.It doesn&#x27;t have much to do with programming, and has almost zero to do with software engineering. reply VirusNewbie 12 hours agorootparentLists, sets, graph traversals, parsing, knowing when to use hashmaps, using recursion, knowing when to use a priority queue don’t have much to do with programming or software engineering? reply neilv 12 hours agorootparentCS101 algorithms and data structures of course are relevant to programming.But Leetcode interviews in practice aren&#x27;t about knowing those.If they were, people would not prep for months specifically for Leetcode, and FAANG recruiters wouldn&#x27;t advise spending months rehearsing for those (for everyone from undergrads with CS101 fresh in mind, to senior engineers who routinely use those in real-world situations).Prep with titles like \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" aren&#x27;t about understanding or practicing software engineering. They&#x27;re about passing fratbro pledge hazing rituals. reply VirusNewbie 12 hours agorootparent>But Leetcode interviews in practice aren&#x27;t about knowing those.I&#x27;m going to guess about 85% of leetcode questions that are asked by top copmanies fall into the CS101 algorithms and data structures bucket. Seriously you can go to leetcode right now and look at Meta&#x27;s most common interview questions and almost all of them are basic data structure questions.I&#x27;m not saying passing the interviews are easy. You definitely have to practice coding fast (at least, I did!).Sure the questions may have a twist, but most of the time there&#x27;s no esoteric weird algorithms. replyldjkfkdsjnv 15 hours agoprevTo reiterate:Ignore all study materials. Go to leetcode.com and literally memorize the most common questions for the company you are interviewing at. This is what your competition is doing. DO NOT LEARN THE MATERIAL. Just memorize itDo the same thing for system design. Memorize the answers word for word. DO NOT LEARN THE MATERIAL.The highest paid tech jobs go to candidates that regurgitate perfect answers to interview questions. Anyone claiming otherwise is lying or doesnt understand whats going on. reply Denzel 13 hours agoparentWhile this advice may work for some FAANG companies, I can assure you this won’t work for Google, especially at higher levels. You won’t find their questions in any public test bank online (trust me, I searched after my interviews).Also, a good system design interview isn’t about designing a “perfect” system (hint: there isn’t one), it’s about defending a reasonably considered design.Google’s system design interview very closely approximates my day-to-day experience designing solutions with my teammates. reply robbyt 12 hours agorootparentAt most of the companies I’ve interviewed at (except Google as you note), the hiring manager and principal engineer didn’t understand system design themselves. They only understood how to pattern match against a regurgitated answer.Case in point, when asked how I’d build Slack, I spent most of the time on data persistence because slack stores all data forever even on the free plan. I got rejected because, “we don’t care how they store data.”Ok, but that’s still a key part of the system design… reply nostrebored 11 hours agorootparentVery open ended question that requires clarification. Interviewing is about asking questions too. reply robbyt 10 hours agorootparentOf course, it was a conversation and the engineer was happy to let me go in depth on storage after we discussed and dismissed other areas, like the front end, integrations, native apps which were not related to infrastructure.We also covered other areas like messaging, authentication, authorization, read &#x2F; write paths, etc… so it was very strange to get the response from the senior manager I got. reply rendaw 2 hours agorootparentprevTo be clear, GP didn&#x27;t mention designing a perfect system but providing perfect answers, which probably includes mentioning tradeoffs or being prepared to answer questions about them. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 13 hours agorootparentprevGoogle I have heard is a bit tougher. No worries, theres ten other companies that just want memorization that pay better than google. reply stale2002 6 hours agorootparentprev> I can assure you this won’t work for GoogleI can assure you that it absolutely does work at Google.I&#x27;ve done multiple interviews at Google, and have received a job offer from them, and every question I got asked was one that I had heard of before. (This was for an L4 position, so mid level. Also, it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens at L6 or higher, as that is comparative rare for almost anyone who is doing interview practice).Maybe your question is super secret, but the vast majority of other people&#x27;s questions are not. reply paulddraper 14 hours agoparentprevSomeone is going to take you seriously.Don&#x27;t memorize it, learn it, become good at it.No matter how much you memorize, there&#x27;s going to be something you don&#x27;t. But I think you know that. reply otteromkram 12 hours agorootparentOP didn&#x27;t say to never learn it. They said just cram it in for the interview.Once you get the job, sure learn it. Unless your job doesn&#x27;t require it or you&#x27;re not that interested.But, online we need to be pedantic. That&#x27;s rule 1. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 13 hours agorootparentprevPeople need to know the truth that these \"genius\" engineers at Meta&#x2F;FAANG are mostly getting in by memorizing. They try interviewing at five top companies. One of those interviews they will absolutely crush, and then will get an offer at 400k+. reply paulddraper 13 hours agorootparentWhen you say \"memorize\" what do you mean?You mean that they remember common patterns to solve problems? Or they memorize questions verbatim? reply michaelt 11 hours agorootparentFor example, if asked \"how would you detect a cycle in a linked list?\" you might memorise \"Tortoise and hare algorithm, two pointers one slow and one fast, fast overtaking slow indicates the presence of a cycle\"A person with a deep passion for algorithms might be tempted to try to solve it themselves before checking the answer - which can be a time consuming business. Time your competitors have used to memorised the answers to 25 more questions.ldjkfkdsjnv has exaggerated a bit, to be provocative - but I&#x27;ve certainly had interviewers ask me questions that stumped the greatest minds in computer science for 25+ years; I don&#x27;t know what they were expecting if not memorisation. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a funny example, because once in an interview I had exactly that question and the week before I saw tortoise and hair.But that wasn&#x27;t FAANG that&#x27;s pretty exceptional.... Most stuff is DFS, memorization, etc... Things that are good principles and don&#x27;t have \"this one weird trick\" reply ldjkfkdsjnv 13 hours agorootparentprevPeople are going on leetcode.com, they find the company they are interviewing for, they remove all questions more than a year or two old, then they sort by frequency. They start memorizing the most frequent questions first. Then they pass the interview. There are other forums with question banks, but I wont get into that reply stale2002 6 hours agorootparentprevMemorizing questions verbatim means that you will often get questions that require only a single line change in your solution.Furthermore, if you have a memorized solution, you can spit that out in 5 minutes, and then spend the next 30 minutes trying to figure out the slight change that you need to do to make it work for the minor change that was made.Speed matters. And having stuff memorized makes everything else easier. reply Der_Einzige 11 hours agorootparentprevThey mostly get in by cheating. A lot of people, even before ChatGPT cheated in college, cheated on their FAANg interview, and then still get promoted later since none of that shit matters and their promotion criteria is on if the button is moved 3CM correctly or not in some app that will be killed in 5 months anyway reply VirusNewbie 13 hours agorootparentprevLol wtf are you talking about. There is no way you can memorize 2000 Leetcode questions.When I interviewed at a google and netflix, not one of the coding questions were on any site (leetcode or hackerrank).

Enough of the companies that believe in testing by algorithms are smart enough to change their questions slightly for each candidate.I&#x27;m not sure, however, what if anything testing by algorithms proves. Sure, you should know how and when to use them like I know how and when to use different blades of a saw. Nobody has ever asked me to tell them how the saw gets made though. The things that matter to me as a Senior+ engineer these days are:- Do you know how and when to use various algorithms- Are you going to conform to a given code bases styling and standards- Do you know how to properly test a given piece of functionality- Do you know how to interrogate the debugger to find answers to your own questions- Do you know commonly accepted standards and where to find them- Are you going to over engineer and completely pollute the code base with unmaintainable code or infrastructureAlgorithms and systems design test for only one of the above. If we ever get a tech union algorithm interviews are on a top five of things I&#x27;d like them to do away with. reply Palmik 15 hours agoparentprevFor many, it&#x27;s much easier to understand than it is to memorize. reply CalRobert 15 hours agoparentprevThis is true. And it&#x27;s a bit frustrating because I have to take care of two young children when I&#x27;m off work, not grind leetcode. But maybe that&#x27;s the point. reply khzw8yyy 13 hours agorootparentThis is absolutely the point. All these interviews are checking is \"does this person spend all of their free time on a task we assign to them, no matter how boring\".

The most obvious way that is close to undetectable would be having a second person looking up the answers, and telling them to the candidate, while the interview is happening. replyguessmyname 14 hours agoparentprevThe interviews I had at Apple were surprisingly straightforward compared to those at many other tech companies. I didn’t find the need to memorize anything, in part because I knew the concepts they were questioning me about after putting them in practice during the last decade of work, but also because the questions were quite straightforward, almost akin to general knowledge, for example:• What is an SSL certificate? Follow up question: What is inside them?• How would you go about designing a modern NTP to sync a fleet of local-first systems?• Do you see a security problem with this code? If yes, what is it and how would you fix it?• Same question as above but with twelve different pieces of code, each one more complicated than the previous one.• What would you consider Personal Identifying Information (PII) in a food delivery app?• Explain XSS, SQL, XSRF…• Hashing vs. Encryption• How to protect customers from phishing attacks?• Say you discover a data leak, for example, a backup in a public S3 bucket. Communicate leak or not? If yes, who will you communicate with? How will you communicate?• Improve event processing logic and performance of the following Java application. Our company revolves around processing events, quickly. Implement the alarm system to monitor incoming events for any delays in processing events by other event processors. (If you find it surprising that Apple uses Java, I share that sentiment. Interestingly, I opted for Go instead of Java to solve the problem during the interview, and the interviewers were pleased to explore a new programming language. I believe this aspect earned me some additional points.)• Design a table booking system for a restaurant (database, API endpoints, etc.)• A continuous integration (CI) build step fails (in tests), what do you do?• What is your ideal Developer→Customer feedback loop? Realistically, what would a bad one look like?• How would you design macOS Photos.app? (The best part of the interview was a discussion about what to do with content that is out of view and the performance implications of different solutions.)• Third-party company wants Apple’s data to show ads. What do you do? (The obvious answer is you don’t give the raw data to them, but if you have to, how do you anonymize it?)• so on and so forth.There was this interviewer who appeared to be commited to ask me one hundred questions in the span of an hour, and while I didn’t count, I think we got pretty close to a hundred. The questions started at an easy level, for example, what is HTML, and increased in complexity every five minutes or so. Fortunately, I realize what type of interview this was and proceeded to give very one-sentence answers, sometimes just 2-3 words before jumping to the next question. One of the funniest, craziest, most exhausting, but somehow rewarding interviews I have ever had in my whole career. At times I thought the interviewer was some sort of artificial intelligence and the webcam was fake. Later, I met the interviewer in person and we became friends.Now, having become an insider, I can attest that it’s acceptable to some extent to memorize responses for coding exercises and rehearse answers for behavioral questions. As you rightly point out, many other candidates engage in these practices as well. However, if a candidate’s proficiency is limited to merely regurgitating code without a genuine understanding and, consequently, an ability to articulate the underlying concepts in both the programming and behavioral interviews, that candidate is likely to face failure.Before landing the job at Apple, I was also in the interview process for a position at Microsoft. The nature of the work appeared to be significantly more fulfilling than what I currently have. The level of technical expertise required during the interviews was remarkable, with the two medium and hard level LeetCode-style questions being the relatively easier segment. Memorizing answers was technically impossible based on the interviewing style. I would have unquestionably accepted that job if it weren’t for the fact that I needed additional income to continue providing for my extended family and covering my mortgage.In conclusion, if you decide to memorize LeetCode problems, ensure that you also grasp the underlying concepts. Unless all your interviewers are gullible, it will become quite apparent if you&#x27;re just mechanically writing code without a genuine understanding of the problem or the interview&#x27;s objectives. reply khzw8yyy 13 hours agorootparentThis simply doesn&#x27;t work without grinding, and grinding happens to be sufficient (whereas understanding is not).You aren&#x27;t just supposed to solve a problem (and can&#x27;t think back to your college years, pull out your copy of CLRS, or whatever). You are supposed to rapidly pattern-match to a specific problem type, and implement. You only have 20-30 minutes (because the rest of the hour gets eaten up by small talk) and this includes testing. Anyone who thinks they can do this with just their knowledge of algorithms without any grinding is in for a shock. reply synaesthesisx 11 hours agoparentprevA former colleague of mine is at Meta thanks to this exact strategy.

So my unpopular opinion, and what I’ve observed in real life as being on the hiring committee or panel at top companies has been that for new grads top internships are an even more important signal than top schools.That is, when hiring a new grad for an L3 spot or whatever, assuming they met the bar for the interview and in fact did an interview, first we look at interview performance, then internships (with an internship at our company with a successful outcome being the best), then school, then recommendations from current employees.

    "originBody": "carlosgaldino Writing a file system from scratch in Rust 2020-07-27 Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored. In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and how they fit together when writing your own. Structuring the disk When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives don’t have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file system to make sense of it all. A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store metadata that is essential for the file system operation. The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the information on the disk: File system structure in a disk In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means. Superblock and bitmaps The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how many are free, etc. Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index in the bitmap set to 0 indicates a free slot, and an index set to 1 indicates an occupied slot. Inode The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved in an inode. The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the inode table as the following figure shows. Inode table (detailed view) For each slot in the inode bitmap set to 1, there will be a corresponding inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table. And this explains the name inode being a short name for index node. Data blocks As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different purposes which we will see shortly. Pointing to data The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the file. The simplest way is to have direct pointers. In this case, each pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use indirect pointers, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is added with double indirect pointers. And for even larger files, triple indirect pointers are put to use. Inode multi-level index To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let’s run an example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB: (12 + 1024) * 4 KiB With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4 GiB: (12 + 1024 + 10242) * 4 KiB And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around 4 TiB: (12 + 1024 + 10242 + 10243) * 4 KiB This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example, a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk. Some file systems use extents to help with this situation. In this approach, there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB. Multiple extents can be used to support larger files. Directories You may have noticed that there isn’t a specific structure for directories. The reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories. The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks. Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the form of (name, index number) so when looking up a particular file (or another directory), the system uses the name to find the corresponding inode. Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a balanced search tree could also be used. Access paths Read When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path, visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file. Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them. Write When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a new inode. GotenksFS As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I’m learning the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1 KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4 KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size. mkfs The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for the file system. This is achieved via the mkfs command: $ ./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img -s \"10 GiB\" -b 4096 After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB. In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be necessary for the next step: mounting the file system. mount After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The mount command is used for this: $ ./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks And you can see some information about it: File system after mounting On-disk structure The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the configuration values provided in the mkfs command. pub struct Superblock { pub magic: u32, pub block_size: u32, pub created_at: u64, pub modified_at: Option, pub last_mounted_at: Option, pub block_count: u32, pub inode_count: u32, pub free_blocks: u32, pub free_inodes: u32, pub groups: u32, pub data_blocks_per_group: u32, pub uid: u32, pub gid: u32, pub checksum: u32, } The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of n blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the ones where user data will be written. The inode is defined as follows: pub struct Inode { pub mode: libc::mode_t, pub hard_links: u16, pub user_id: libc::uid_t, pub group_id: libc::gid_t, pub block_count: u32, // should be in 512 bytes blocks pub size: u64, pub created_at: u64, pub accessed_at: Option, pub modified_at: Option, pub changed_at: Option, pub direct_blocks: [u32; DIRECT_POINTERS as usize], pub indirect_block: u32, pub double_indirect_block: u32, pub checksum: u32, } As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB. The number of direct pointers is set to 12: pub const DIRECT_POINTERS: u64 = 12; When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using the definition below: pub struct Directory { pub entries: BTreeMap, checksum: u32, } Block groups The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an Inode to 128 bytes; the corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for user data. Instead of doing that, we can create block groups that will always have one block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for user data. Block groups Reading and writing to files Now that the “disk” is set up, we can start writing and reading files from it. Creating a new directory using mkdir: Creating a directory The process that occurs is the following: the system searches for the inode of the root directory, looks up in which data block the contents are being written to, allocates a new inode and data block for the new directory, writes the entry to the root directory, and finally, writes the new directory to its data block. Writing a new file follows a similar method. The system traverses the given path until the final directory is reached and adds an entry representing the new file. The write function provides the path, buffer with the data, offset, and a file info struct that may hold a file handle along with extra information about the file: fn write(&mut self, path: &Path, buf: &[u8], offset: u64, file_info: &mut fuse_rs::fs::WriteFileInfo) In this case, instead of traversing the path again to find the inode, the system uses the file handle (the FS previously sets it when creating the file). With the inode in hand, the FS can build the struct by seeking to the exact location where the Inode is written: fn inode_offsets(&self, index: u32) -> (u64, u64) { let inodes_per_group = self.superblock().data_blocks_per_group as u64; let inode_bg = (index as u64 - 1) / inodes_per_group; let bitmap_index = (index as u64 - 1) & (inodes_per_group - 1); (inode_bg, bitmap_index) } fn inode_seek_position(&self, index: u32) -> u64 { let (group_index, bitmap_index) = self.inode_offsets(index); let block_size = self.superblock().block_size; group_index * util::block_group_size(block_size) + 2 * block_size as u64 + bitmap_index * INODE_SIZE + SUPERBLOCK_SIZE } Now that the FS has information about which data blocks are currently allocated to the Inode, it can use them to find the exact location where to write the data, in a process similar as shown above. New blocks are first added to the Inode direct blocks array, and if the file size exceeds (12 * BLOCK_SIZE), the FS allocates an indirect_block that holds the numbers identifying other blocks containing user data. And in the case the file is even bigger requiring more blocks, the system adds an extra layer of indirection using the double_indirect_block field which points to more indirect blocks. Reading from a file follows the same method. You can see it running here: Reading and writing to files Conclusion The idea behind a file system is to define a structure for the contents on disk which then allow the system to operate on top of it when creating, writing and reading from files and directories. We learned some of the concepts used for the on-disk format, how directories and files are represented. One interesting aspect is the usage of indirect pointers to allow storing large files. If you are interested in learning more about file systems, I would recommend reading more about other techniques that are used such as journaling, copy-on-write, log-structured file systems, and also how modern file systems apply these and other techniques. Maybe start learning about the one you are using right now. The code for GotenksFS can be accessed here: carlosgaldino/gotenksfs.
